aCOJYTIVaa	I am all for banning the use of plastic bags - especially those with Walmart on the side of them.    I keep busy during the day - I make jeans bags -   I started out with my own old jeans.   Just cut off the legs at the crotch line and sew straight across the bottom.   Then make handles from the "legs" and stitch them to the waist line and Viola!<br>  A jean bag for your groceries or whatever.    I have to date made about 20 such bags and plan to give some away as gifts on the holidays.   No I am not cheap - just practical!   Also these can be decorated by those of you who know how to applique, embroider or by being innovative.!<br>  <br>  It should be noted that it takes OIL to make plastic bags, so to abolish them is a win win situation.   So ask your neighbors to share their old jeans with you!                  CJ|`|q9BItD25aa	I grew up where your groceries were put in a large box or two and delivered to your house. Then came paper bags which we covered our schools books with. We would also make Halloween masks out of the brown paper bags. I now use the reusable bags they are selling for a dollar. I still have hundreds of plastic bags that I used to pick up the dog " deposits".|`|AA11570788	Those plastic bags should be phased out. Not only are they bad for the environment, but they break. A gallon of milk will break through the bag making it useless.  I use the recycleable canvas bags.  Our store gives five cents back on each one. That's reason enough to use them.|`|C3VD56hIaa	At you point in life, why do you care what happens in the next fifty years?

I think everyone should do as much as possible to decrease the amount of non-biodegradables in our landfills.|`|CkKlZFVmaa	I feel for Paul's answer, I have also seen plastic bags hanging in all the bushes.  However if I have a secondary use for plastic bags, such as garbage can liners or pooper scoopers, I will use them and then properly dispose of them.  I will not ever just drop my trash somewhere because out of site is out of mind.

I only take what is given out of convenience now...we bring our own bags also...|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Awhile back I was out in far West Texas on an oil  lease and was saddened to see thousands of plastic bags hanging in the brush for miles and miles and miles. This country is beautiful in it's own right and to see it littered with plastic from horizon to horizon was terrible.  The oil field equipment distracts from the beauty of the land and the sight of plastic bags, carried by the wind, only added to the ugly picture. Land owners in West Texas are a proud people and I can only imagine their tears when they see their ranch country looking like some great dump or landfill. I would vote for the prohibition of all plastic bags for consumer purposes.  Too bad that we are not a people who can successfully discipline ourselves with out the force of law.

Humans have probably been around for quite some time in their modern form.  We will likely never have much evidence of our distant history, because until recently there have not been that many Homo sapiens on earth.  In fact, genetic analysis indicates our species went through a bottleneck of 20,000 or so individuals at one time.  Many different species of the genus Homo are known, some of which  are markedly different, but it is important to note that they were not our ancestors, they were our brothers.  For example, modern humans and neanderthals coexisted until only 24,000 years ago.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_(genus)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_(genus...</a>|`|tuULGJS6aa	Cro-Magnon Man was the first Homo sapiens.

Alligators, for instance, are just the same as they were in the time of the dinosaurs, because the environments and climates where they live have not changed.  You could make the argument that they are not as far evolved as the mammals who came later, but that's not really true since they have had the same amount of time to evolve, they just didn't have as far to go.  Apparently that's true of Frenchmen also. 8^)<br>  <br>  There is another theory, sort of an alternative to evolution (or a different way to look at evolution) called 'punctuated equilibrium'.  The idea is that a population of animals evolves to become well-suited to their environment and then they reach equilibrium, they stop evolving.  Until they overpopulate or for some other reason a part of that population moves to a new, different environment.  There they struggle to survive because they are not as well adapted, and they evolve in a new direction to match the new environment.  Perhaps the environment of Western Europe hasn't changed all that much in 30k years.|`|hQWucH5uaa	Because that is only one bone from the entire skeleton.  <br>  <br>  There are several physical and genetic differences between Cro-Magnon, Neanderthal, Homo Erectus, and finally Homo Sapien.<br>  <br>  Homo Sapien is the only hominid survivor of the above mentioned human variations.<br>  <br>  Cro-Magnon man no longer exists (though some Homo Sapiens look and act like throw-backs).

I think it is getting a little out of hand. I heard one of the airlines was going back to Not charging for soft drinks, as that did not go over to well with the passengers. I also think in some way it would be against the law, as there are no other options available, for those that do not want to pay, to use the restrooms.

Those are fair enough as they're optional and if you travel light,and don't care where you sit,then they do a good deal. The problem is,the toilet is not optional,people have to use it.

I think it's reasonable to charge people for the number of bags they bring along; but charging extra for a small refreshments doesn't work for me, it's not like we can bring our own bottle of water from home.

Africans have black skin to better adapt to the hot, dusty climate of Africa while Caucasians are white and hairy because this better helps them to survive the colder north. Asians have a layer of fat under their eyes probably because to shield their eyes from cold winters.<br>  Descent is also a factor because different groups migrated out of Africa into different regions. Each of these groups have a slightly different genetic haplogroup (anthropological subtype).|`|238ca7113ff45c9c845ea02e21b7356faa	Katie is right I will add some of what she has not said yet.<br>  <br>  curl hair :<br>  ppl who originated in desert like in middle east, india and europe where the the weather is dry. the curl of the hair made your skinhead can cool off..........the more hot weather, the more curl hair.<br>  <br>  straight hair :<br>  the only one race with thicked straight hair is mongoloid race. that's because they originated in the east o russia ( nearby berring strait) where is very cold. the jet black hair reflected the sunrise to warm up their head. the straightness of hair made no cold air touch the skinhead.<br>  <br>  <br>  tall ppl :<br>  ppl who are tall originated in the good weather ( not too cold or too hot) plus the good food like cow milk, goat milk.<br>  <br>  short ppl. :<br>  ppl who originated in very cold area like mongolian and eskimo. their bodis need to be short and plump. it reduces the percent of the skin area to touch the cold air.<br>  <br>  Deep set large eyes :<br>  ppl who originated in hot climate. take a look at middle easterners, africans, south east asians.......some theory states europeans moved from the north of middle east and central asia and that's why they got deep set large eyes. the ppl who move into northern europe developed some of the asian facial features like smaller eyes.  ( notice : swedish tend to have smaller eyes than Italian or spanish.)<br>  <br>  flat nose :<br>  flat nose occured among ppl who staying in a countries have much jungles.........some believe if u got high nasel or long nose, your nose will crash to the trees. the more forest, the more flat nose. the more desert ( no forest) the more hook nose ( big long nose)|`|2948461bc351babded4abfbd847dceecaa	Different groups adapted to their environments and regions, e.g., in hotter, humid climates darker skin and coarser hair, etc.|`|SUMV525Aaa	different environments.

xRUZkFU9aa	What odd parents. They have some control issues apparently.<br>  <br>  If they ask why you guys aren't coming, tell them you think you're a little to old to be tagging along at family events and wouldn't want to burden them. LOL No seriously...because obviously it's such a terrible burden for them to drive their own son and you there...like come on..it's a family event! Everyone carpools.|`|itbkP9HGaa	I believe there are 2 sides to every story and we're only getting one side here.  Its hard to believe that out of the blue his parents would be that unreasonable.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, which was, "If asked why I am not attending this event (mentioned above), what should I tell them?", I would advise you to simply say you are unable to attend due to a previous obligation.  No need to go into detail, you don't owe anybody any more than that.|`|fHpPgMlZaa	That is silly on his mothers part.<br>  <br>  Why aren't you going? Its hard to answer without knowing.

He should feel it is odd to be driven to a family function,<br>  <br>  I will take a guess here and say that his and your attitudes will lead you both to seperation, you mentioned they are not your family either? well if you plan on being with this one your whole life, they will become your family like it or not, and most daughter in laws with your attitude end up divorced|`|171a80e252b822a9deb861297f623e51aa	Hmmmm... Although his parents might have said it rudely -- I don't know since I wasn't there -- well... I agree with them.  I mean, couldn't you use Google maps or a paper map?  What is so difficult that you would need someone else to drive you?  It sounds very strange.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You have a computer, use Mapquest and go by yourselves. Problem solved, unless, of course, you're looking for a reason not to go.|`|xnsU60hhaa	I would say his parents don't like you and are beginning to dislike their own son. And I have no idea why they think "it wouldn't look right". They obviously have some issues. Glad they aren't in my family, lol!<br>  So, if anyone asks why you aren't attending, tell them you don't want to. You are a big girl now, you don't have to explain your reasons to others. And certainly don't have to make up excuses.

nrXECQoHaa	it means that alot of people would be attracted to u|`|tYqUutidaa	The Strong Law of Attraction<br>  <br>  The Law of Attraction isn’t a new idea, but with the releases of What the Bleep Do We Know!? and The Secret it may now have more believers than ever before. The hypothesis has been analyzed (and dismantled) so thoroughly by skeptics, philosophers, neurologists, and quantum physicists that I didn’t think I’d have anything original to say about it, but a few criticisms have popped into my head recently that I haven’t run into elsewhere (if you have, please let me know). I’ll share them, for what they’re worth.<br>  <br>  In my experience the Law of Attraction comes in two flavors which I’ve started mentally referring to as the strong Law of Attraction and the weak Law of Attraction.<br>  <br>  Adherents of the strong law claim that we’re gods who don’t know that we’re gods. We have unlimited power fettered by very limited understanding. Nothing stands in the way of having everything we could ever want, instantly and effortlessly, except our own minds. The universe never fails to give us exactly what we wish for at every moment, so our wishes must be the failing point.<br>  <br>  Someone wanting to fly would only have to believe wholeheartedly that he could. Most people are convinced that human flight is impossible (or at least have deep-seated, unconquered doubts about it) and that belief produces our inability to fly. The double-edge of unlimited power is that you have unlimited ability to limit yourself?—?a god who believes he’s a man can only be a man until he believes something else. Every doubt and anxiety and fear is as much of a reality-shaper as every desire. It’s not a problem of not getting what you wish for; it’s a problem of an undisciplined mind consciously or unconsciously polluting and sabotaging every wish you make.<br>  <br>  A few exemplary individuals in history (religious icons, many of them) have fully realized their divinity and taken the reins. They’ve ceased their self-defeat and mastered their personal power, rendering all things possible.<br>  <br>  This is the strong law in a nutshell, and though you might think it’s just an extreme interpretation I’ve found it to be surprisingly common. As I recall this picture isn’t painted explicitly in The Secret, but they sure do seem to be trying to plant the seed.<br>  <br>  The strong law borders on solipsism and shares its many flaws. What makes it especially unconvincing for me is that it seems to render human discovery impossible.<br>  <br>  There was a point in history (more distant than most people think) when the world was assumed by all to be flat. The notion of the world as a free-floating orb never entered the minds of our earliest ancestors. Why would it? What reason would they have had to question something so transparent to the senses? Doubting the world’s flatness would be like doubting a heavy thing’s heaviness or a red thing’s redness?—?a philosophical exercise that cavemen didn’t have the leisure for.<br>  <br>  So in a world filled with god-men who were in harmonious agreement that the world was flat, why didn’t the world resolve to actual flatness? They weren’t aware that the world could be anything but flat. There was no doubt, no fear, no confusion. For the Law of Attraction, there’s no better condition than single-mindedness of this magnitude. And yet roundness (something no one was desiring, at least until someone started to wonder what held everything up) is what we eventually found, in spite of all this.<br>  <br>  What went wrong? To individuals with ultimate power, the difference between manifesting a flat Earth and a new car is trivial. How could a universally-held belief ever be proven false in a framework where belief governs reality?<br>  <br>  And how in this framework could we make discoveries for which we have no expectations whatsoever? Since the Earth became round we’ve stumbled upon germs, quasars, tectonic plates, radios waves, quantum entanglement, dinosaurs, etc. Usually scientists see things coming, but certainly at least one world-changing thing has been discovered in the past for which there was no precedent and came as a complete surprise. What, if not human intention, conjured these things into existence?<br>  <br>  As you ask more questions like these it becomes obvious that this power of ours must be limited. In order for the Law of Attraction to be compatible with an objective, independent, pre-human reality (which our ability to discover things entirely new to us is an indicator of) there must be physical laws which remain untouched by it. Our creative influence must have boundaries.<br>  <br>  Where the boundaries are drawn is the problem of the weak Law of Attraction, which is the subject of the next post.|`|0TuWYaneaa	It means your hot! Send us a picture.|`|H2MB3iezaa	It is said that if you truly want to find success, you must keep thinking about the things that you want most of the time, and you would soon be able to achieve them. Many people might wonder how that is possible. The answer is the universal laws of attraction that can help turn your dreams into reality. Your thoughts are powerful enough to attract good and bad things, now it is up to you whether you want to use this power to transform your life for the better. This article, as the title suggest, talks about the seven laws of attraction that can help you take a step towards achieving all that you have dreamed about.<br>  <br>  These seven laws of attraction can not only help attract positive changes, it can also turn your life around within no time. Educating yourself about the seven effective laws of attraction would help you understand how to use them successfully in your life.<br>  <br>  The seven laws of attraction that you need to be aware of:<br>  <br>  The Law Of Unwavering Desire: If you genuinely want things to happen and you know that you deserve it then there can be nothing keeping you from achieving your dreams. This way you send out the right signals to the universe which allows your dreams to come true.<br>  <br>  The Law Of Manifestation: Thinking about success frequently would help manifest desires and dreams. However, keep in mind that thinking pessimistically can lead to negative events in your life. If you concentrate hard enough on achieving your dreams, you would get what you wish for.<br>  <br>  The Law Of Magnetism: Human beings without their knowledge, radiate energy, positive energy leads to positive results and negative energy leads to negative results. Therefore, make sure to emit positive energy to bring in positive changes into your life.<br>  <br>  The Law Of Synchronization: Do not make an effort to resist the way things fall. You need to align yourself with the universe to receive the gifts it has to offer.<br>  <br>  The Law Of Delicate Balance: Remember that desperation is a negative emotion and it may come in the way of your success. Therefore, you need to find a balance between your present life and the dreams that you hope to achieve. Keep your eyes on your goal but you must also keep your head in the other spheres of life.<br>  <br>  The Law Of Conscientious Action: If you have heard of 'karma' then you must know that good actions lead to good returns. You need to do good things for positive results in your life.<br>  <br>  The Law Of Universal Influence: Do not make the mistake of taking things for granted. Appreciate what the universe has to offer. Exude positive influence and you would see good returns.<br>  <br>  These are the seven laws of attraction that can help you achieve your dream and ambitions. Your thoughts can attract that promotion, wealth and any other thing that you may desire. Use the power of attraction to find what you have been looking for; take the right step towards success.|`|IhIXtf9yaa	it just mean that people are more attracted to you

The highest position is occupied by those whom Allah gave knowledge and wisdom. <br>  <br>  Recite this verse 12000 times to remove humanly unmanageable distress and hardships.|`|aRaMjnQ1aa	Allah (swt) Created everything, everyone.|`|wq0GA7uxaa	Allah (swt) created everything, EVERYTHING you see in the universe!|`|Qvc0tVOnaa	LOL very good question, But Shi'a don't believe prophets or messengers to be Imams!!|`|mVSC9aKoaa	Both..<br>  <br>  What do you think about the guy called <br>  Imam Khumeini|`|WmU7jhObaa	Imams=Humans=allah's creation

I swear to Allah, they cannot complete/perfect the four, unless they complete them through the fifth one (Walayah of Ahl ul Bayt {P.B.U.T})"|`|aRaMjnQ1aa	No, Insha'allah Rasullahi (saw), will save his Ummah on the day of judgement.|`|mVSC9aKoaa	No, Allah shall save Ahlus Sunnah from evil of Ibn Saba|`|q9C46Wuqaa	No, we save ourselves.
zXDVn4BQaa	I don't care what their name is, I look them up online and get comments from the best source:  patients.  I've found some great doctors, including a dentist named Pena!(Pain-ya, hell of a name for a dentist).<br>  <br>  I think you're getting some negative comments because people who live in areas without a large Hispanic/Filipino population(aren't you from CA?) don't know how to pronounce that name.|`|aCOJYTIVaa	On the way to North Little Rock from Springfield, MO you will pass through a town (I use that word politely) named Marshall.   In Marshall there is a drug store and it has a beautiful big painted sign on the side wall for all to see - - -  -   "The Sharpe Payne Drug Store" -  - - welcome to Marshall.<br>  <br>  And yes, in the Wheeler Clinic in Springfield - Dr. Bonebrake practices <br>  orthopedics!<br>  <br>  CJ|`|ysUqQ9Qkaa	yeah and I wouldn't care about the office plants either.  but then again I've had my legs pointing in the wrong direction, knives sticking out of me, and all sorts of wild stuff.  bottom-line, I'll take medical care from whoever can give it.|`|LQ52bOFFaa	I don't care what my doctor's name is or what it means in another language.  I just want a good doctor, whose name I can pronounce and doesn't speak with an accent.  I am terrible at understanding accents.|`|NFY4A1csaa	Our neighbors had a family doctor named Dr. Reddiwell.  His office was in Artesia, California and they were very happy to be his patients.  Who wouldn't, with a name like that?|`|vOYyFqxRaa	My son went to see a Doctor named  Dr. Strange. I know someone who will be Dr. Wang someday. I 'd go.|`|yUAMqWtnaa	what do you mean whats wrong with that name|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	I've had friends with that last name and pronounced it 'Pennia' so I don't have the same association with it. I worked in a Dr.'s office for years and came across a few names that were 'unique' to their profession:<br>  Dr. Payne - Podiatrist/surgeon<br>  Dr. Peter Hang - Urologist<br>  Dr. Skankey - Gynecologist<br>  These are all Dr.'s in So. California and as far as I know, still practicing.|`|UllYFJgjaa	True story.....a girl in the office where I worked back in 1979, she had a Gynecologist by the name of "Dr. Weiner". The girls in the office would tease her about it, and we all laughed about it including her. The doctor back then was in his 60's.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	blu, you bring to mind the humor that my Sweetie and I enjoyed in the midst of one of our darkest hours. We were seeking the talents of a plastic surgeon several years ago and my Sweetie commented on what a handsome fellow this surgeon was. He, indeed was a fine specimen of a  male of our specie and looked to be in his early forties. I asked Sweetie if she would be so foolish to visit an ugly plastic surgeon.  I told her this guy could work on his appearance in the bathroom mirror and besides that, he is probably in his late seventies and only appears to be in his early forties. I wasn't about to give up any ground to a younger, very successful professional, who my Sweetie recognized as an attractive man. <br>    My current General Practitioner is a Dr. Maldonado and I have total confidence in his ability to provide me with expert professional health care. He treats me with very little pena. As a child my family doctor was a Dr. Fly in Uvalde, Texas. My Dad had a good friend who owned and operated a shoe store.  His name was Adam Shoe. During my career I had occasion to deal with a man named Tom B. Still and another named Joe B. Good.  I also did business with a man named Will Power.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Sure, I'd see a doctor named Pena. It's not the doctor's fault that the plants have died. It's up to the staff or a cleaning crew to tend to the plants.<br>  <br>  I once went to a dentist whose name was Dr. Payne.|`|8G42oyydaa	They had to change the name of "Tod Mountain" in the interior of BC because it means "death" in German and was discouraging German tourists from skiing there.  Now its called "Sun Peaks".<br>  <br>  While translating tourist brochures for BC the agency I worked for came up against a real problem. One of the attractions is fishing for "Steel Head Trout" however a direct translation into Chinese for "steel Head" is the Chinese word for "penis".  Nothing arrogant about the Chinese male is there?<br>  <br>  My dentist is named "Dr. Kiss" just FYI A most appropriate name for a dentist IMO .<br>  <br>  Would you be comfortable flying if the Captain came on to the PA and introduced himself as "Captain Crash" and said his copilot was "Captain Shivers"?

I worry about how com-<br>  petant he or she is. I usually ask for referrals, if I am considering a<br>  change, if I feel I don't have the best doctor working for me. I have<br>  changed, when a doctor has a strong, and authoritative demeanor, and<br>  doesn't care to explain things. Or one who feels I'm challenging him,<br>  by asking about a treatment. They are not gods, and they are not in-<br>  fallable. They often can and do, make poor judgements. So it pays to<br>  oversee your health care always. Expect explanations if you are per-<br>  plexed by anything involving your care. Never be afraid to ask a ques-<br>  tion. Also never be afraid to suggest another mode of treatment, or<br>  another medication, if you've researched some that may conflict with<br>  other meds you use. I have experienced questionable tactics from<br>  doctors in the past, and often have had to resolve issues in my mind before I can go ahead with treatments.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Some people don't seem to appreciate your humor but the name thing is a good question anyway. I do take a step back when a Doctor has a strange name and ponder if I really want to see him/her at all.

Now, I don't remember anything about him, what he looked like or, well anything except his name. Dr. B. O. Boring. Seriously. Not kidding.|`|CkKlZFVmaa	It is not the name that bothers me, it is the fact that some of today's docs look to be about 16 years old.  Just try telling a kid all about your ailments and you will get my drift|`|80lWqRFiaa	Their name would not stop me, it is more important that I hear from people around me that they are a good doctor.|`|AA11296212	Just so my proctologist isn't named Dr. A$$hole.|`|WbKBHh8Haa	my proctologist-dr. boyle...honest
LQ52bOFFaa	Yes, especially some of the ones I read about in the news.  Examples, the nineteen year old that had his one year old son in the dryer and turned in on.  This was in today's news in Arizona.  Stupid kid.  The young girls that throw away their babies in spite of the Safe Haven laws.  These kids that know the dangers of smoking cigarettes, doing drugs, drinking and driving and then do it all anyway.  The kids that start having sex when they are way to young, some at twelve!  I don't know if I want to beat the tar out of these kids or their parents.  I could go on and on about courtesy and manors, but I'll get off my soap box.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Boy or boy do I know what you are saying. The youth of today are an embarrassment to grandparents and to the whole world right now. Their attitude and arrogance is not to be believed. But they shove it in our face daily that they can do or say what ever they want to. The way they dress is not age appropriate, they look like hookers going to school. The boys look like gang members.  Nasty to look at.<br>          Having said that, I will not take your words literally but if it would make a difference, I would join with you with a smack down anytime, any place you say. Do you think that it would help at all?|`|CkKlZFVmaa	I am unaware of any 'tar content' in today's kids.  Quite a few of them do have a high 'crap content'.  However having just recently (haw haw) been one of those kids, I don't think any beating is necessary, it seems to leak out as they gracefully age.  That is what happened in my case.  Peace Brother|`|fyrj50Braa	I think they should bring National Service back so that when they leave school they have to go in the army for 2 years. Kids of today get away with so much they're just aloud to do whatever they like. Most no all have no respect.|`|80lWqRFiaa	NO, violence begets violence.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	No thanks.

Probably the reason some young people are angry and destructive is BECAUSE they have had the "tar beat out of them".<br>  <br>  I suggest ignoring them, communicating with them, understanding why they are the way they are.  Since we are the adults, then supposedly we are supposed to "know better" right.|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	It is my job to work around the youth of today five days a week.  Being a no nonsense kind of gal I've found that a well placed phrase uttered to a particularly obnoxious youth who spends more time at "day reporting" then in school works well.  Of course It's said when I'm one on one with the student.  That phrase is "I know a guy named Bubba at the prison who is going to love it when you get there".|`|JO8FKDRhaa	i think you could quiet your violent impulse if you consider that its like for them. growing up today is no easier ( as a matter of fact its harder) than it was back in your day. kids are stupid, their brains aren't fully formed yet, and maturity takes time. beating them up would be of little use to your aim, it woudl be less than counter productive.|`|zXDVn4BQaa	No.  Better watch it, honey.  The OLD troll who terrorizes this category will report you for an illegal question(violence or threats).  He has no sense of humor.|`|fd7f7760fab598ddb7f5fd26f811c2baaa	Nope sorry.

Take her somewhere nice, make her a nice meal, it might do the trick.  As to what it means it means one of a few things<br>  1) I care about you and dont want to trouble you<br>  2) I dont care about you and dont want anything of you<br>  3) I really want something off you but dont want to sound too greedy<br>  There is about equal oppertunity of each.|`|55ZVxKw0aa	I would still get her something, but unlike most of the people here what she is most likely looking for is something that means a lot to her, not just expensive.

T1beLIQqaa	Arabs and the closely related Jews are Semitic Whites, generally having olive(golden brown-like brass) colored skin. Last time I looked wool is usually thick, fine, and white(sometimes black), not course and kinky.Here is two of what, in my opinion, are the best pictures of what Jesus really looked like-his hair does resemble wool, but NOT Black ethnic hair: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://naturescorner.wordpress.com/2008/11/09/jesus/" rel="nofollow">http://naturescorner.wordpress.com/2008/...</a><br>  <br>  The tide has again turned on the Shroud of Turin, and, it is NOW believed to be the burial cloth of Jesus-here is what is known from it-male-5'10"- estimated weight 170 lbs, Caucasian(most likely Semitic White) features, blood type AB+(common in about 23% of Middle Eastern Jews-almost none existent among Blacks).This does NOT describe Black features Semitic Whites and Blacks are two different ethnicities. <br>  <br>  Most of the Ancient Egyptian mummies are Arab Semitic White by DNA(haploid testing) and anthropological measurements, mainly the skull,small amounts were Black Nubians-people of Kemit-Sudanese, Black/Arab Semitic White admixtures-Berbers, Moors, Hamites,  and even smaller amounts of all other ethnicities. Cleopatra was Greek, having olive(golden brown) skin color-Greeks are Indo European Aryan Whites-literally hundred of busts, drawing, paintings, and coin imagesfrom that time period, now exist and her features do NOT appear Black.The scholars seem to agree: Cleopatra was the last in a line of Ptolemies--Macedonian Greeks(Whites)--who ruled Egypt from the death of Alexander the Great in 305 B.C. until Antony's defeat in the battle of Actium in 31 B.C. The Ptolemies, as was the custom, were an incestuous, intermarrying peoples (to preserve the royal bloodline),also often having relations with the courtiers and concubines who filled their palaces. Many of the children born of these unions were given a place in the royal lineage despite being illegitimate, the secret unspoken.<br>  <br>  Many believe that Cleopatra's father was the product of such a union--his mother may have been a concubine from Nubia(Black) or Alexandria(White). Lending credence to this theory is the fact that Cleopatra's bond to the people of Egypt seemed greater than those of her Ptolemic ancestors, who aligned themselves culturally and linguistically with Greece. <br>  <br>  The following are some helpful links:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpress.com/2008/07/22/the-faces-of-ancient-egypt/" rel="nofollow">http://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpre...</a><br>   <br>  <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_africa/v032/32.1keita.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_...</a><br>   <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Gates" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Gat...</a><br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.catchpenny.org/race.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.catchpenny.org/race.html</a><br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/RaceOfAncientEgypt.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/R...</a><br>   <br>  <a href="http://naturescorner.wordpress.com/2008/12/13/where-the-ancient-egyptians-black-or-white/" rel="nofollow">http://naturescorner.wordpress.com/2008/...</a><br>  <br>  Arabs ARE NOT Black-famous models with Arab Semitic White fathers-Black mothers-Iman, Lila Kebbede.

King Tut, against expert opinion(considered Caucasian), was an admixture of the very same type as Anwar Sadat- see the above link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://naturescorner.wordpress.com/2008/12/13/where-the-ancient-egyptians-black-or-white/" rel="nofollow">http://naturescorner.wordpress.com/2008/...</a><br>  <br>  Queen Berenice of Egypt and Libya the one you speak of, is actually half Greek,half Iranian/Persian- King Magas was Greek and her mother Queen Apama,  was Iranian/Persian ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucus_I_Nicator" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucus_I_...</a>  ) - both are Indo European Aryan Whites.

Whenever I hear people try to come up with proof, clinging to threads saying that Cleo was not black they always follow up their "proof" with a racist statement like "Yeah right, they expect us to believe Cleopatra looked like Shaniqua and had braids?" <br>  <br>  Which is funny actually becuase many Egyptian mummy's were found with braids (and dreads). Maybe becuase they had the same hair texture as other people with braids and dreads? Hmmm...And people who try to point to modern day Egyptians as proof that Ancient ones were not Black clearly have no idea about the timeline of history. Cleopatra lived in the time before Arabic invasions of North Africa. <br>  <br>  And the same with people who claim Jesus could NEVER have been a black man. I don't mind listening to reasonable arguments against it, but then they try to downplay obvious connections (black people's hair has always been linked to wool and so has Jesus', black people skin has always been seen as burnt and so has Jesus') and in the process insults black people's phentoype. They have just exposed what they really think of black people. So there opinion is skewed by their prejudice of how they percieve modern day "blacks".<br>  <br>  Some even go so far as to say that the passage that describes' Jesus' appearance (Revelation 1:13–16) could have been about ANYONE. These types of people think a debate means ignoring and falsifying evidence that contradicts their theory. You see, they think if they say it enough it will become true and suddenly history and facts will be rewritten. <br>  <br>  They have shot themselves in the foot if they expect to have any credibility in my eyes after that. Just becuase Eurocentric whites want to believe Cleopatra looked like them:<br>  <a href="http://www.mrdowling.com/images/702cleopatra.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mrdowling.com/images/702cleop...</a> <br>  (blue eyes? really Hollywood?)<br>  <br>  Does not mean she actually did. That's cool, the rest of us know what's up. :-)|`|pnZssBg9aa	Not all of Cleopatra's ancestors are known with certainty. Bernice of Libya could be a black Arab or an Eastern African (like Nubian or Ethiopian) so Cleopatra may have some black ancestry.<br>  As to Christ being black, evidence is weak though. I think he's purely Jewish.<br>  Your question is interesting because I was wondering if Roman Emperor Septimius Severus, Phillip the Arab and Pope Gelasius I were black. It wasn't entirely clear if they were, or were mixed race.

And she wouldn't have just kept on talking to you.<br>  <br>  She might not have been interested, but didn't want to make a scene.  But uninterested doesn't equal violated.  Honestly women know how to let you know they don't want any and she wasn't really doing anything (from your story) to send that signal.<br>  <br>  Her friend that spoke to you about (tongue in throat) was just a word I won't type out.

I think that as a Western woman myself, it can be assumed that she DID like what you were and had no objection to is, because she did not ask you to stop. <br>  <br>  From this standpoint, I don't think you committed any form of sexual assault whatsoever. So please don't worry about that anymore. As for the young lady in question, it is likely that she has forgotten the event. <br>  <br>  I think that you might have been confused by her friend's question, regarding the sticking of the tongue down the throat. To put it mildly, this woman was very very crude. Understandable that you were offended - I imagine that other people present were also offended. But then, don't forget that many people present were probably quite drunk and when people are drunk, they are more likely to be less inhibited. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't judge you at all - I've seen young men do far worse to young women, by comparison you were a gentleman.<br>  <br>  I wish you every success in your studies, and hope you find what you are looking for in the path you have chosen for yourself.|`|bZo5Z53Uaa	*She should have said something to you, if she did not like it.

We all make mistakes, but it seems you are a good one at least you realised your mistake and felt guilt or as you put it disgust, not many people feel like that. <br>  <br>  *When you wake up in the morning, do not expect to see the evening live as though today is all that you have. Your life's span is but one day, as if you were born in it and will die at the end of it. With this attitude, you will not be caught between an obsession over the past, with all its anxieties, and the hopes of the future, with all its uncertainty. Live for today: During this day you should pray with a wakeful heart, recite the Qur'an with understanding, and remember Allah with sincerity. In this day you should be balanced in your affairs, satisfied with your allotted portion, concerned with your appearance and health.<br>  <br>  *Do not be sad, for do you not see how the black clouds disperse and the violent winds subside?

They must be better than others in order to be happy. <br>  <br>  American culture also begs that parents place strict limits on their children. You will not choose your own clothes. You will not choose what you would like to eat. You will do your homework when I tell you. You will complete it in this time frame and do it exactly as instructed. You will learn to play the sport, instrument or artistic medium I ask of you. You will use your free time in this manner. You will not play with those children.<br>  <br>  Children do not learn to think for themselves and enter depression in their late teen years as they struggle to define themselves apart from their peers. They will be unhappy because they seek approval from their peers just as they always seeked approval from the adults in their lives. <br>  <br>  Many minority communities and, of course, aware American parents, however, teach kids to think independently by giving them increased freedom and responsibility without stickers, stars and happy faces. <br>  <br>  Kids learn to think for themselves and do what they think is right for them and others. This creates healthy, self-actualized people.|`|DfDss68haa	I would have to see the percentages, the numbers aren't important because there are so many more white people than black people. I see the % is also higher. 11% vs. 7% I don't see that commiting sucide as just a sign of weakness, that's just wrong. It has more factors than that. <br>  <br>  1. White people perhaps haven't been culturally taught to endure. In the AA community, black people are just taught to swallow misery and grit their teeth. I am not sure this is such a good thing though becuase it often means there is a stigma against having a mental illness in the minority community in a way that there is not in the white community. So black people may not seek out help until it is too late, or when we are mentally ill we are mistakenly thought to just be violent and evil. <br>  <br>  2. The American black family is often more extended and close knit than the American white family. I know, this is a shocker since all we read about in papers is about baby daddies and horrible black men. But I have both white and black friends so I can safely say that in my considerable experience my black friends are closer with their extended families than my white friends. White people are closer to their immediate family than minorites. And minorities are closer to their extended family than whites. They are more often to have cousins, grandmas, aunties, uncles running around than white people. And who is more likely to commit suicide? The person with one family member or the person with eleven? Likely the person with only one. <br>  <br>  Even when my black friends have a broken family, they have other support networks to fall back on. Like church. Yep, one of the risk factors of suicide is not being religious. And there are more white athiests than black athiests, Christianity is still a big factor in the African American community. People who are church going are less likely to kill themselves for many reasons. They have heard they will go to hell and they also have the support group of the church to help them through. Like the one white male I knew who commited suicide had all the risk factors. He had no extended (or immediate family), he lived alone, he had depression, he was not religious. There was no one home to stop him when he hung himself.<br>  <br>  3. As I have previously stated, there is a belief that white people are more likely to be mentally ill and that is is shameful to be crazy. This is a societal stigma but is very much believed in minority communities. We are taught to just pray and the crazy will go away. Therapy is the lowest of the low. This has a downside and and upside. Downside is that religion may keep someone alive but it also means they don't get the treatment they need and are expected to just pray about it. And it also means violence in black people is often put down as being plain mean and the black criminal doesn't get the help they need and may even be sent to prison instead of a mental hospital. I have a schizophrenic uncle who stole a car becuase the voices told him too when he was 19. And becuase he was black, the white jury saw another evil black man and sent him to jail without seeing that he needed help, not punishment. <br>  <br>  4. Statistics are often reported and recorded with a bias. Becuase there is such a stigma against suicide for blacks, their family members are more likely to report the death as "accidental overdose" or "death by misadventure". I bet if we added in deaths of Black people that look suspiciously like suicide attempts, the statistics would get a lot more honest. <br>  <br>  Whatever the reasons, I don't like the tone in your question that implies white people should be blamed for commiting sucicide more. It's fine to state statistics but like any stats there are other variables and there should be no blame. We should be looking for ways to stop this epidemic, not make it worse.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	There are more whites then blacks, thus, there would of course be more number of suicides in that group just because of sheer numbers.........<br>  <br>  EDIT - your argument is not valid because you state that blacks can't be broken by any situation...lmfao! They have broken homes, they are in gangs, they are the highest ratio in jails, they get on welfare....do you not call that broken...lol!

Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.<br>  <br>  3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.<br>  <br>  The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry there is no easy way out with this, you must develop your skills in ALL these language "levels" or dimensions in order to reach better language skills!! <br>  <br>  Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!!

Tledw3eAaa	I don't get it. Which part is confusing?<br>  <br>  I'm still not sure about hadith, but I have to say this one makes perfect sense to me. Seriously, which part aren't you understanding or agreeing with?<br>  <br>  * Well... from my point of view, I think what it is saying is that if you had true faith or belief, this would cause you to do right rather than go against God. If you're not following God, you're following something else, and so your faith/belief is not there. Also, I think it is also saying that God is forgiving, that by going back to following God is how your faith/belief returns.<br>  <br>  I don't think it is necessarily only concerning muslims though. I think it would concern anyone who was a believer in only God, who did something that went against Gods will. Rather than cause a muslim not to be muslim, I would say it causes a believer to become a non-believer.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion though.|`|zKFSCCWOaa	I love this hadith. Of course, he is not acting according to Islamic law at the time of doing it and he is not thinking about Allah so in a way he is not acting as a believer should act.

That is because if one was to still believe in the commandments and prohibitions of Allah at that time they would not commit the sin.  After the sin is over and you feel remorse and ask for forgiveness (sincerely) you will be forgiven.    This doesn't mean one should sin with the idea that they will be forgiven, that's not how it works, lol.  Allah knows best!|`|jHWEEZmCaa	hadith is false the truth is in qoran. when a believer commits a grand sin, he's in a status in between believing and denying. if he repents and reforms and pays for his crime by his own free will, and without being near death, then he will become a believer again. if he died without repent, then he's a denier and deserves eternal hell.|`|WmU7jhObaa	it simply means he is not a Beliefer in the time of his sinning, and he will get judged accordingly. any other questions?<br>  <br>  yes i am also familiar with this Hadith and thank you for reposting for the people who are not familiar|`|89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	Wa alaikum salam warahmatullahi wa barakatuh.Yes this means that when you did maksiat (bad doing) you are disturbed by syaitans so your faith is weak and you obey to syaitan's propose.Obeying syaitan means you are not in the right path or you are disbeliever.But if you repent,it means you come back to a right path and you become a believer again.But if you do the same mistake often like this repeatingly,you are not serious to be repent so Allah will not forgive you.Allah could not be mocked.Allah will hate you.A serious repent means you do not do the same mistake in the future.You must make prayer on time and dzikir  and qur'an reciting everyday if you do not like to be disturbed easily by syaitans(bad jinns).

Taking the life of a baby is wrong in every circumstance. I know a few women that were told that they might die if they carried their babies to term. Guess what?  Both the moms and babies are fine, If I got pregnant and the drs. told me this, I would risk my life, because I would not want to be held accountable for taking the life of my precious child, to save mine.  Rape is horrible, but we have to remember that is it not the baby that should be given the death penalty!! My belief comes from the one that created each and every person for a purpose.

I do not believe in "exceptions", because there are absolutely NO good reasons for killing a baby, whether that be rape, incest, or "health" of the mother. And doctors say that there are no medical circumstances under which, if a pregnant woman has a life-threatening condition, that killing the baby would save her life. It just doesn't happen, folks. A doctor should ALWAYS treat BOTH the mother and child as equal patients, and try to save BOTH lives. If a woman needs an operation or needs to be treated in a way that might threaten the life or health of the baby, one should leave it in God's hands, not kill the baby. Just treat the woman and leave the baby alone. <br>  For those who think that punishing a baby with the death penalty in cases of rape for the sins of its father, you should take a look at this woman:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.feministsforlife.org/img/cop/ads_PDF/03DeathPenalty.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.feministsforlife.org/img/cop/...</a><br>  <br>  Also, if a woman has an abortion after being raped, it's like being raped twice. Abortion is a very invasive procedure that leaves a woman feeling violated, even if she gave the OK for it. Also, carrying a baby to term after a rape helps the woman heal psychologically from the rape by turning her attention to someone who needs her, instead of on herself. Having an abortion doesn't "un-rape" the woman.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	I am convinced that abortion ends a human life.  If I am correct, abortion must be made as rare as possible.

It should be a last resort, and as rare as possible. It should, of course, remain legal, and easily accessible, and run by health care professionals. It should not be used as a form of birth control, since there are so many effective forms of contraception available. <br>  <br>  As a man, who can't get pregnant, it is really none of my business. And to those fools who say "It's God's business," I say: You're being intrusive. Stay out of it. <br>  <br>  As for the pro-lifers: Stop worshiping the fetus, and spend a little of that energy helping the babies and children who are already here. Stop electing presidents who cut funding for child health care, and who then use that money to build killing machines so they can send young people to phony wars to die. Start pushing for comprehensive sex education, for kids and adults, so we can teach them how not to get pregnant in the first place, thereby reducing the numbers of abortions. Why you people can't make the connection between reduced pregnancies and fewer abortions is beyond me. You're not going to stop people from having sex, no matter how much Jesus you throw at them. "Abstinence only" sex ed is a tragic joke; it has only succeeded in increasing the numbers of teen pregnancies and the spread of STDs. Time to grow up.|`|mwdtZUPkaa	I don't like it, as it terminates the life of an innocent individual.  That being said, however, I feel it is necessary when the mother's life would be in danger if she continued with the pregnancy, because losing one life would be better than losing two lives.<br>  <br>  Abortion should not be used as a means of birth control.  People should own up to taking responsibility for their actions.<br>  <br>  My stance is based on my concern for human life.<br>  <br>  No, it is not based on religion.|`|oC0HfFm1aa	Personally I think abortion is a horrible procedure.

Yeah it's murder...No matter how bad it sounds, it is. God already has a plan for that baby the SECOND you get pregnant. These are partially religious beliefs but they are MY beliefs too. Even if they get raped or can't tell their abuse father, it's still murder. That's what I think, and is my opinion. 85% of the people who have abortions are usually full of guilt later in life. There are places who can help teen pregnancies like putting them in special Christian, or even non-christian, homes to help protect them. =) A lot of the people don't think very long and hard about abortion. PRO-LIFE. Also, even if the mothers are unable to support the baby, they can put their baby into open or closed adoption, which is much better than murder. There are a lot of people who's moms that almost had an abortion on them, and are perfectly innocent, self-denfensless people. <br>  -king H....where did homosexuality come into this? It's not natural...it's all in their heads...and from media promotion and temptation. That's an actual PROVEN fact.<br>  <br>  Also...war is justice. God is pro-life, but still believes in justice.

Birth? 25? I don't know.|`|Rsww6L5qaa	I believe that abortion is evil and barbaric.  Unborn babies feel things just as much as we do, if not even more so.  Some common methods of killing them include slicing them up with knives, sucking their brains out with a vacuum tube, and drying them out with salts.  Sometimes they use chemicals which in effect is poisoning them.  This is all done in the name of "choice".  Do you wish that your mother did the same thing to you?<br>  <br>  Abortion is something that "cannot" exist in a civilized society.  To put this into perspective, Hitler gassed about 6 million Jews during World War II.  Just about everyone agrees that Adolf Hitler was evil.  But since 1973 when abortion was legalized, we have killed over 43 million babies.  America is supposed to be the Land of Freedom, but how can we call it this if we are perfectly willing to kill our unborn.|`|NqJDWKDPaa	Personally, I see abortion as a sin in all forms unless the birth of the child threatens the life of the mother.|`|CjkD145aaa	fine<br>  personal beliefs not religious|`|26414b2f3237391dde0fd3b0221fcffcaa	It's up to the parents, not old priests or the government.

grwtwPbAaa	The only one Steadfast who can handel everything is our Lord!  The greatest Presence this world has ever known is Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior.  And when we are tired we need to go to Him as the scriptures ( Word of God) reminds us to do!  Jesus himself said. "Come to me all who are weary and burdened for I will give you rest."  ( Matt11:28. <br>  <br>  Jesus is our greatest friend brother and I know this question you ask is meant to remind us of this.  I may get tired as life is moving fast though it appears slow.  And although life is exciting ti is sad too.  God speaks loudly and God speaks softly to us. Some days I am so strong and other days my emotions cause me to cry out,  "Lord, I can't take it anymore!" This teeter todder I ride, needs to be balanced, and I need someone on the other side who will help me with this problem.  Someone who will stablize the balance and order of my thoughts and emotions.  Someone who will get the plumbline in me straight again, and One is My Everlasting Father! Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today and tomorrow!  Oh, our weaknesses, hey brother? But do I want to let the world burn , no brother for this is not the Will of Our Father, we are to tak up our cross!  And we need to believe in the promises of God, He will not forsake us, but help us in this battle!  <br>  <br>  Somedays my weakness out weighs my strength, somedays my joy outweighs my sorrow.  No matter what, it is always a battle.  When I become too tired and want to throw in the towel, I know I have to go home, into the arms of my heavenly Father, who gives me rest.  Just like the prodigal son, I go to him and say "Abba, please help me!"  And then I tell him all my woes of the day, all of my concerns, and even how tired I am.  I confess to Him my weakness.  And you know brother, He loves me but He tells me I have to keep fighting!  <br>  <br>  When I cry out to him all of the schemes the devil has done, He listens patiently  until I have poured my heart out.  Then he reminds me that He has a plan, from Creation!  He reminds me that he began this with an end in mind.  There is no scheme the enemy of God hasn't already defeated is what I hear!  He also reminds me that His strength is my joy.  The strength of the Lord is staying connected with His joy brother.  So we need to tap into it.   I think that Satan knows that if he can rob us of this joy, we will become defeated.  But you know God knows so much more than Satan, and He is our Defender!  And His word, reminds us that in our weakness , we are made strong, because He is strong!  So even if we ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE DEFEATED, TO FORFEIT OUR JOY, HE THEN IS MADE EVEN STRONGER IN OUR WEAKNESS!  <br>  <br>  The biggest thing to remember is that we are not fighting alone dear brother!  When we look at Moese, and how tired he became as he kept his arms up we see that Aaron and Hur came to help.  And this is something we need to see.....that God places specific people i in our lives to help us keep fighting....we belong to a great family, the family of God and we are to utilize this!  God will help us brother to keep our arms up when the stand and walk are hard.  <br>  <br>  "A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for advesity!"( Prov 17:17.  <br>   We can not walk away and give up, we need to remember our mission, for Jesus paid the price and we are HIs ambassadors on earth and HIs voice for others to hear.  We are to press forward and ask the Lord for His renewed strength so that we can mount up as eagles....God promises us in His Word that He is for us, not against us...and that he will give us His strength.  The battle was won long time ago, and Jesus paid the price...<br>  <br>  A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother....Proverbs 18: 23- 24.  <br>  <br>  Steadfast, thanks for this question, I needed this reminder.  The Lord will renew us brother and He will give us His joy.  He will also send us brothers and sisters to hold us up when we weak.   God bless you brother!  Thank you for lifting my arms!  Hallelujah!  :))|`|9YMLsk7Taa	Sometimes i get frustrated like that! We just have to remember we were once lost too .

So we run with patience the race that is set before us not necessarily for the crown but for the One waiting and ones for us at the end.

I think Adam's "fall from grace" is the story of everyman in that it describes how it feels to become "self-conscious" or "objective" about one's self. This is something that animals don't seem to achieve but is a natural quality for human beings but it can feel like a curse when it first develops and causes much heart ache. In the end, if you stay with it it leads to wisdom and enlightenment.<br>  <br>  Of course there are alternative ways of seeing the same story.|`|Rsww6L5qaa	I do think it is kind of unfair.  But it is also true that one can only reproduce after their own kind.  If Adam and Eve were sinners, their children would be as well.<br>  <br>  I wish I had no concept of sin.  I wish I never had to see all the evil that goes on in this world.  But Jesus Christ is called the "Second Adam".  Jesus Christ has covered our sins and made us right before God.  All we have to do is accept his payment.  He made it possible for us to come into his presence.

We are not born sinners, we are born with the ABILITY to CHOOSE to sin.  And so, each of us is given the very same choice Adam and Eve were given:  obey God and live, or disobey Him and die (physically AND spiritually).  Therefore, we are not being held responsible for Adam's sin -- we're being held responsible for our OWN sins.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	God is in control!<br>  We must have faith He knows what He is doing, for everyone, all the time, even now!  :D|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	I'd agree with them, but then I'm not a Christian.|`|AA10052130	It WOULD be unfair, IF God did that.

Sin hurts others; that is why God hates it so.  Adam, being the first man, has passed on the effects of his sin to all of his children.  But that is not the same as being counted guilty for Adam's sin.  We each commit our own sins, and are condemned for our own transgressions.<br>  .|`|c316178951b8605e913804fde0cb6becaa	I'd tell them they're right, it would be unfair and that's why a just God would not.<br>  <br>  We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam’s transgression.  - 2nd Article of Faith, Pearl of Great Price<br>  <br>  Yes, we all live in a mortal, terrestrial state due to Adam and Eve's transgression.

The phrase "hold responsible" suggests that God is blaming AND punishing people for the sins of others and I don't believe that's the case at all.  <br>  <br>  I do believe that we ALL suffer for the sins of our ancestors...all the way back to Adam.  He started it, and as his descendants, we are a product of his sin.  I even think it is accurate to say that Adam and Eve are responsible for making us the sinners we are today. However, I have to wonder if, had he not sinned, would we even exist (as we exist today at least)?<br>  <br>  As for the fairness issue, I think it is ridiculous to suggest that God has been anything but excessively "fair" to the descendants of Adam and Eve...doing so disregards everything he said and did before AND after Adam's sin.  Here's my little "nutshell" perspective on the whole issue...<br>  <br>  God, the King of the Universe, had (created) a son who was "the spitting image of him". God gave this son, Adam, everything he wanted and needed as he groomed him to one day take his rightful place at God's side. When he knew the time was right, he provided Adam with the opportunity to acquire something he would need when he took that place...and God knew that Adam would take the opportunity even though it meant rejecting what God was offering him (abdicating the throne if you will!).  Adam chose to "strike out on his own" ("...better to rule in hell than serve in heaven" perhaps *laugh*).<br>  <br>  Armed with God's knowledge of good and evil, Adam started a new life outside the kingdom and began a quest to build his own empire here on earth.  ...and he passed both that knowledge and that ingrained "empire-building" drive to his children.  Over the centuries, God repeatedly offered the descendants of Adam the opportunity to benefit from his experience and abilities in their quest to build their earthly empires while simultaneously offering them the opportunity to earn back the birthright that their ancestor Adam rejected a long time ago.  <br>  <br>  Finally, when he knew that "we" (human beings) had enough evidence to accept that we simply aren't capable of building the kind of empire we desire here on this earth, he sent Jesus to give every human being the opportunity to "come back home where we belong"...to once again share in the birthright that Adam rejected...to become "heirs to the throne" again!  <br>  <br>  The only thing you have to do is accept that Jesus was telling the truth...that God is taking care of building an empire beyond our wildest dreams and our only responsibility is to learn to use that knowledge he gave us through Adam to demonstrate our love for him and for others!<br>  <br>  In essence, it goes something like this...Adam exchanges (sells) his claim to the throne of God in exchange for power ("knowledge is power").  For a few thousand years after that, God offered to help his descendants build an empire here AND the opportunity to learn to use that knowledge of good and evil to earn back the birthright of Adam.  Then, Jesus came to make it crystal clear that we can't have it both ways...either we focus our attention on building our empire here OR we focus on learning how to use the knowledge he gave us to do as he commanded us...love God and love others.  <br>  <br>  It boggles my mind to imagine how anyone could think God has been less than generous let alone unfair in his treatment of the descendants of Adam.  Adam traded one priceless gift (eternal life) for another (knowledge of good and evil), God is offering GIVE the first gift back to anyone that is willing to have enough faith to believe the offer is genuine!|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	God's most essential law, applicable way back in the Garden of Eden and in effect ever since, is the law of sin and death.<br>  <br>  Very simply: You sin ... you die.<br>  <br>  Conversely, one without sin cannot die.<br>  <br>  The fact that even newly conceived infants are subject to death, is absolute proof that they have already been affected by sin in a very profound way.<br>  <br>  Hence, Original sin is a theological fact affecting all of humanity, and anyone (of any age) who has not been baptized has no assurance of Heaven, and remains a child of God only in the strictly natural sense ... but not in the supernatural sense that's typically required for eternal salvation.<br>  <br>  Original sin has absolutely nothing to do with personal accountability, no matter what a person's age, since in regard to Original sin, personal guilt is not at issue.<br>  <br>  The "age of accountability" applies only to the person's ability to know good from evil, and to form the necessary intent to commit a sin.<br>  <br>  The reason God set things up this way is simple. I'll let St. Paul explain it for you:<br>  <br>  Rom 5:18  Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation: so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification of life. <br>  Rom 5:19  For as by the disobedience of one man (Adam) many were made sinners: so also by the obedience of one (Jesus Christ) many shall be made just. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/infant-baptism-salvation-without-works/" rel="nofollow">http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/infant...</a>|`|daf653722b9a000bcaed6ea65b1dc5e6aa	Why would it be unfair?<br>  <br>  If an individual left behind any debt, collectors can after his/her kids and spouse, and all of the deceased's inheritance as well.<br>  <br>  And, how aren't we affected (not effected) by Adam's sin?|`|ajXkKnB0aa	I would answer that the someone is delusional.

Any similarities between Masonic rituals and LDS Temple ordinances are superficial at best.<br>  <br>  Some Christians may not understand the concept of the temple, or its centrality in early Jewish and Christian life, but anyone who has read the Bible knows that a Temple is more than a meetinghouse or synagogue, and that the Mormons are the only Christian or Jewish sect who claim to have one.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	I think you are confusing the Mormons and the Masons.  The Masons are a fraternal order based on the craft guilds of the middle ages.  They only have male membership, and only accept members who are monotheistic in religion.  Otherwise Mason membership is by invitation only, and is usually extended to people who meet their standards for community involvement.  <br>  <br>  The Mormons are a group of people who accept that the Angel Moroni came to Joseph Smith and presented him with Golden Tablets which contain the Third Testament of God, and talk about Christ bringing his message of faith to the lost tribe of Levites in America.<br>  <br>  The two different organizations, one craft guild based, and the other religious have really nothing in common to the best of my knowledge.  However, I'm sure that every crackpot hypothesis of conspiracy ever conceived has made it on to the internet.  You should understand that the presence of a hypothesis on the internet does not automatically lend it any more credibility.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|UQTAN7cgaa	No.<br>  <br>  This shows you know nothing about religion or freemasonry.<br>  <br>  A few wack jobs on the internet aren't going to destroy a several hundred year old religious tradition.<br>  <br>  There are no masonic rituals in LDS (Mormonism).<br>  <br>  to some others:<br>  <br>  technology does not = the end of religion...and has nothing to do with fanatacism (in the middle east or elsewhere)<br>  <br>  islam is the fatest growing religion.<br>  <br>  perhaps the a-religious are the only growing part of the population, perhaps that is why the world is so screwed up and getting more screwed up. people believe they have nothing to answer for, are accountable only to themselves...|`|ZT9vNoNqaa	No. It's hard to quantify what impact the internet is having on Mormonism at all, let alone a little thing like Masonry in their temple ceremonies. Even with real numbers about attendance and tithe-paying this would be a murky subject, but the LDS church seems very reluctant to reveal anything more than this increasingly meaningless number of "total people at one point baptized and not known to be deceased."<br>  <br>  Anyway, I think most Mormons are already aware that there are similarities to Masonry in their ordinances, and they're generally unfazed by this. The fact is, as TSM already pointed out, most people *on either side* don't do much serious research when deciding to join (or leave) the faith.<br>  <br>  I think the single biggest impact the internet has had on questioning Mormons is not the availability of well-researched information, it's the visibility of an actual ex-Mormon community living in the midst of all the believing Mormons.|`|DArAz67Caa	what is there to destroy----in all honesty---??|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Hell...they are the only ones adding members.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	If their missionaries explained the rituals in the first lessons, there would never be any converts.<br>  <br>  According to a new ARIS survey out today, the LDS church is 1.4 percent of the population, exactly the same as 1980.

AA10007956	To those who have written mean answers to atheists: Judge not lest ye be judged.<br>  Jesus once said, "Let those who have not sinned cast the first stone."<br>  <br>  We as People of the Book should not react with anger and scorn to others who do not understand, or even respect our religion.<br>  <br>  To answer the question,<br>  <br>  Many atheists too question Life and God and seek answers. Sometimes, perhaps due to the actions and sins of our fellow Christians, they mistake or disregard God's word and the Bible based on those actions.<br>  They might react with anger, disappointment and frustration which belies perhaps their hunger for justice and knowledge of God, life and the Truth which many a fellow Christian have failed to practice properly and gracefully.<br>  <br>  Just because someone doesn't believe in something doesn't mean they might not want to, or they aren't looking for answers to their questions!<br>  <br>  Instead of judging them, we should answer earnestly, regardless of how 'offensive' a question is, or how we feel it may be 'ridiculous'.<br>  What may be 'ridiculous' to you might be of importance or significance to them, and vice versa!<br>  <br>  By helping to invite people into the Lord's grace through humility, example and kindness, we are heeding Jesus's actions and words. To me, that is the best thing we can do as Christians.<br>  <br>  Extend a kind hand, a patient ear and tolerance towards non-Christians, disbelievers and atheists, who knows? Perhaps you might have made a difference in their lives.<br>  <br>  I for one, believe just because I am Christian doesn't mean an atheist has nothing he can teach me. I am not afraid of his questions because I have faith in the Lord and if there is something I do not know I reply with prayer and seeking the answer from the Bible, and my own life's experiences and logic.<br>  We can all learn from one another.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Jenova.|`|0OyKadRyaa	Basically, atheism is a religion.

SLSX6QQsaa	Hello!  It sounds like your friends have fallen into the typical college Freshman slump that many do fall into.  Most get literally "fat and lazy" and do nothing but play video games, drink, eat junk food, smoke pot, hang out and go to parties.  It's sad but true.  It sounds like you did more than your part to try to wake these guys up.  You are not their father and its not your responsibility to motivate them.  But you are being a nice friend in considering their futures and showing care for them.  I would sit down with them and have a talk, ask them about their future dreams, where they think their lives will be in 5 years.  If they want to be successful they should wake up at this point.  Some people simply are not ready for the responsibility of college at age 18 also.  I was unable to attend college until I was 24 and eligible for a student loan.  My parents made too much money and disqualified me from getting a loan.  I could not afford to pay 1k out of pocket per class.  I am 27 now and I have finished my Associates Degree, and now I have 8 classes left until I get my BBA.  I am soooooo happy :D  And I will have a Masters before I am 30 also because I am not going to stop here.  I want to be a Human Resources Manager for a large corporation but I will settle for upper management of a large corporation if I have to. lol.  High hopes right?  yeah doctor lawyer engineer never interested me.  But anyways, you are a really good friend for trying to help these guys.  If you have the talk with them and they still ignore your advice, just leave them alone.  They will learn their lesson sooner or later.

OUP6408laa	Their is a torture method known as "Sawing"<br>  <br>  The condemned was hung upside down and then sawed apart down the middle, starting at the rectum. Since the condemned was hanging upside-down, the brain received a continuous blood supply in spite of severe bleeding. The condemned would remain alive and conscious until the saw severed the major blood vessels of the abdomen, and sometimes even longer. In Asian countries, the condemned stood up while constrained and sawing started at the head.

AA11263905	Saluton!<br>  I'm not sure which site you are referring to. Is it www.lernu.net ?<br>  There is a course you can download and work on offline at your own pace. It's at www.ikurso.net<br>  The email course is also free of charge and you get the guidance of a tutor. Let me know if you are interested in that option.<br>  To find a local group, go to www.esperanto-usa.org and click on 'local groups'|`|4930cb2ee42e57e5f94bd93ab4bbd916aa	I agree Lernu.net and the correspondence course are great, but there are also other free ways to learn that may be more useful. <br>  <br>  You could borrow a book from a library, such as 'Teach Yourself Esperanto' by John Cresswell.<br>  Or if you are lucky there may be a local Esperanto group near where you live. All the major cities in Australia have these kind of groups that meet regularly and are free to attend for practice, but I'm not sure about US.

hJDbOKR6aa	Honestly, don't even bother. No matter what you do , it's not going to impress her parents. For Indians, success is measured by your level of education and your salary. That is a broad generalization but although sad, it's true for many. Being in the military most likely isn't going to help either, especially if it's of the United States. I would suggest you do something that you actually enjoy.<br>  <br>  On top of that, Indian culture is fairly racist (trust me on this). No way around it. There's is very little to no diversity in most areas of India. Her parents were probably already stretching themselves just by letting her date (usually arranged marriage), and you being black (I mean no offense), put them over the  edge. <br>  <br>  If your really serious about her, your going to have to understand that her family may never accept you. Just be polite and keep your chin up. Don't let them ruin your relationship.<br>  <br>  Back to the job, I strongly emphasize that you don't try to impress them. In my experience, the only jobs they would respect would be being a physician, lawyer, engineer, high-level businessman, or any IT profession. Basically, the stereotypical ones.

nzdDdKtyaa	Not every bad thing in this world is punishment from God. We live in an imperfect, sin-stained world, so sometimes bad things just happen.  Stop blaming God for every little thing that happens.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	God doesn't punish a child for the sake of what his parents do or don't do. The one example we have is in the Bible when Jesus came across the blind man, and His disciples asked Him who had sinned, the man who was blind or the parents.<br>  <br>   Jesus said neither one, but this happened for the glorification of God. You aren't responsible for anyone else's sin, nor are they responsible for yours. We each one have to answer for our own sins and making our decision whether to live for Christ and be redeemed from sin, or die because we decide to reject God and His plan of salvation for us. <br>  <br>  Neither can we pay for the sins of our fathers, nor they for their children's sins. And Satan is the ruler over the earth until Jesus comes and destroys him. He is the one that is determined to hit God's family to make them doubt His love for us. Satan comes that he might steal, kill and destroy us because God loves us so much that He sent His only Son to die on the Cross for the redemption of our sins.|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	If you believe in the God of the Bible then you should accept that since He's God he can do anything He wants simply because no one can do anything about it and He can't be questioned.

These people experience what is necessary in their lifetime, to learn what they were intended to learn. Everything these people are experiencing is for the greater good. It is when someone understands perfection, yet still rebels, that we get chaos. This is why you hear of such terrible atrocities on this planet, such as murder and rape. Many people are spiritually confused and/or deprived. They make the decision to act upon someone's life in a negative manner, causing pain and suffering.

dCewrtXaaa	A dogie is a stray or motherless calf in a range herd of cattle. But it's an American word, not Australian.<br>  <br>   <<In the language of the American West, a motherless calf is known as a dogie. In "Western Words" Ramon F. Adams gives one possible etymology for dogie, whose origin is unknown. During the 1880s, when a series of harsh winters left large numbers of orphaned calves, the little calves, weaned too early, were unable to digest coarse range grass, and their swollen bellies "very much resembled a batch of sourdough carried in a sack." Such a calf was referred to as dough-guts. The term, altered to dogie according to Adams, "has been used ever since throughout cattleland to refer to a pot-gutted orphan calf.">>|`|AA10948829	Context would be amazing.<br>  <br>  Are you trying to spell dodgy?

It is God's will for women especially now a days to preach the gospel. God is not particular about a  person as long as he or she is willing to be used by God. Paul teaching maybe acceptable during his time but not in our time for it is God who will decide what is good for us. Women are not exempted to do His will.

Women are more effective preachers now a days.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	If I was alive during the time he wrote that to the church of Corinth I would have, considering that was the only church he wrote this to and he was very specific in his details he outlined; meaning that he was wring to the one church and likely singling out one female (without naming her)who was disrupting that church. <br>  We can look to the women in the bible such as Debra, Esther, and even mary Magdalene. All of them were called by God to stand up and speak to an audience of men.|`|wTfY9AmPaa	First, this is allegorical, not literal.

The situation and culture was very different then.<br>  Peace be with you.|`|esPmtVfxaa	Very well said. A man who knows what hes talking about and can back it up with the word!|`|VRl1jENHaa	Just to get this on the table from the beginning, Paul did not prohibit women from evangelizing to men.  There are many examples of this happening in the Scriptures, and none are written in a bad light.<br>  <br>  In the Scriptures you've quoted, Paul stated that women should not exercise spiritual authority over a man.  This means that a woman should not be a Pastor, Bishop, etc.  This DOES NOT mean that a woman who answers a simple question from a man is rebelling against the word of God, since she lacks the authority to compel him to believe what she's told him.  Also, she lacks the authority to punish him for not believing.  THAT'S what Paul is talking about.<br>  <br>  For confirmation, meditate upon the account of Priscilla teaching and correcting Apollos at Acts 18:<br>  <br>  26 So he [Apollos] began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.<br>  <br>  Now consider the fact that, on ALL occasions that Paul mentions Priscilla (otherwise known as "Prisca,") he writes of her fondly.  They were even travelling companions BEFORE she "corrected" Apollos! (see Acts 18:18)  If she was doing something wrong, then he would have rebuked her -- yet we are told that she continued her teaching ministry, together with her husband (Romans 16:3 & 1 Cor. 16:19).|`|LPCfOtiKaa	This only means that a woman can't be a pastor or priest or what have you. It means that woman shouldn't teach men of spiritual things in a formal setting, nor hold authority over a man (in the church, not in general).  A woman can hold authority or teach when it does not have to do with the church, like Esther, who was queen so obviously held authority over many men.<br>  <br>  If a man asks a woman a question of spiritual matters she has every right to give her input.  Paul says that the woman should go home and ask her husband questions about teaching instead of asking them during the sermon. I'm sure during these man and wife conversations the woman had lots of things to say and maybe even taught her husband a thing or to. Answering spiritual questions in this manner is not what is being discussed in these verses.  Therefor, any Christian woman answering questions here is not doing anything wrong.|`|RJRantBfaa	Well spoke, good question.<br>  <br>  I wonder the same thing.
f3nwI8ytaa	No.  The idea of marrying for romantic love is relatively new, actually.  For the vast majority of history, marriages were arranged and worked just fine.  This is still done in many parts of the world.<br>  <br>  peace<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I should add that this doesn't demean the value of romantic love.  I'm madly in love with my wife, and in two weeks we will have been married 30 years  It's just that romantic love alone is not a solid enough foundation to support a successful marriage.  Commitment is the true foundation for marriage.  The object of that commitment can vary from culture to culture, but it is the fact of commitment that sustains marriage through the inevitable trials that come in life.  One of the questions I ask folks in pre-marital counselling is what they are going to do when they wake up one morning and realize that they're not in love anymore.  That gets me some funny looks, but it's simple reality.  People fall into and out of love several times in the course of a lifetime together.|`|8pQrIL90aa	Love is what makes the relationship work, and first to love the Lord is to know how to love your mate that you wed.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	Personally, I don't see why anyone would get married if it wasn't for love.

Sure you can technically walk out of your house right now and there's nothing to stop you from marrying the first person you meet of the appropriate gender, but if you don't love each other, then what's the point and what's going to make it last?  I mean, sure you can marry someone say rich for example, but if you don't love them, then how are you supposed to uphold fidelity?  And what happens if one of the pair is infertile?  Does that void their marriage?
A8frjLzuaa	From what I have read, the Anglican church is sharply dividing into 3 camps: traditional, moderate, and liberal.  The Archbishop of Canterbury has lost control of his congregations and other bishops.  The traditional branch of Anglicans are in talks with the Vatican to convert.  As many as 400 Anglican priests are ready to swim the Tiber to Catholicism and they would take their entire congregation with them.  From what I have read, this would happen as quickly as within a year (but we'll see).  <br>  <br>  I read <a href="http://www.catholic.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.org</a> for latest news about the Anglican converts to Rome.  So you may be able to find yourself a traditional Anglican community and you'd be happy, or you can convert.  Good luck to you.|`|YOK5Gf70aa	Maybe you can start a movement within??

AA11440601	Very interesting.<br>  <br>  Since when is saving souls "treating ‘vulnerable human beings’ like cattle to be herded."<br>  <br>  Not all stem cell research is immoral. Only embryonic stem cell research is immoral.<br>  <br>  Catholics believe that life is a sacred gift from God and needs to be treated with all human dignity from the moment of conception to the point of natural death.<br>  <br>  For this reason, the destruction of human embryos to harvest embryonic stem cells is immoral. <br>  ? The end never justifies the means<br>  ? A moral good can never come from a moral evil<br>  <br>  Here are just a few of the common myths about Stem Cell Research:<br>  <br>  Myth: Stem cells can only come from embryos. <br>  <br>  Truth: Stem cells can be taken from:<br>  ? Umbilical cords<br>  ? The placenta<br>  ? Amniotic fluid<br>  ? Adult tissues and organs including bone marrow, fat from liposuction, regions of the nose and even dead bodies up to 20 hours after death<br>  <br>  Myth: The Catholic Church is against stem cell research. <br>  <br>  Truth: The Catholic Church approves three of the four types of stem cell research:<br>  ? Against Embryonic stem cells<br>  ? For Embryonic germ cells (from miscarriages)<br>  ? For Umbilical cord stem cells<br>  ? For Adult stem cells <br>  <br>  Myth: Embryonic stem cell research has the greatest promise<br>  <br>  Fact: Up to now, no human being has ever been cured of a disease using embryonic stem cells. Adult stem cells, on the other hand, have already cured thousands. There is the example of the use of bone marrow cells from the hipbone to repair scar tissue on the heart after heart attacks. Research using adult cells is 20-30 years ahead of embryonic stem cells and holds greater promise. <br>  <br>  Based on the “The Ten Great Myths in the Debate Over Stem Cell Research” by Tadeusz Pacholczyk, Ph.D. <a href="http://www.ncbcenter.org/10Myths.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbcenter.org/10Myths.pdf</a><br>  <br>  Adult stem cells are currently used for the medical treatment of:<br>  ?

Not all stem cell research involves the creation, usage and destruction of human embryos. Extraction of such cells using current technology requires the destruction of the human embryo. Some opponents of the research argue that this practice is a slippery slope to non-reproductive cloning and fundamentally devalues the worth of a human being. Contrarily, some medical researchers argue that it is necessary to pursue embryonic stem cell research because the resultant technologies could have significant medical potential, and that excess embryos created for in vitro fertilization could be donated with consent and used for the research. This in turn, conflicts with opponents in the pro-life movement, who advocate for the protection of potential human life. The ensuing debate has prompted authorities around the world to seek regulatory frameworks and highlighted the fact that embryonic stem cell research represents a social and ethical challenge.|`|98db094f444e5154c3fcacd3e51e23c2aa	To be fair, I think the 'pro life' loonies do care about the unhuman cells, just a little too much.

If so...when did your children become "babies" ? I like the quote "if it's not a baby, then why is miscarriage so sad?" I agree that we do have serious social issues with poverty. I don't think it's fair to put pro-lifers and Christians into a category stating that they don't care about babies once they are here. You don't know what every individuals intentions are. I thought we were a country priding itself on dissolving stereotypes. I don't think you give pro-lifer Christians enough credit. I'm a zealous pro-life Christian myself and I can tell you that my church has a very strong pregnancy crisis center that DOES help parents and children in need..before and after birth. The members of our church gives enormous amounts of donations to help.  I think its weird how the Mormons are being attacked after their stance on the marriage amendment in Calif. It's not just the Mormons who protest it, it's EVERY conservative believer. People just believe what they hear on the news.

The term "Catholic" is from the Greek "katholikos" which means "whole" or "complete" and was first used by Ignatius of Antioch in a letter to Syria circa 106 CE to refer to the whole of the believers in Christ with the exception of those who the followers of Peter and Paul judged to be heretics, like the group which later became the Gnostics.  By that usage anyone who believes in the literal life, ministry, and crucifixion would be Catholic and the Non Catholics would be those who believe in Christ but reject the idea that he existed in a literal human body and actually suffered a human death.  The Roman Catholic Church became a separate entity in 1054 when the Eastern Orthodox Catholics refused to accept the Bishop of Rome, now known as the Pope, as having authority over other Bishoprics than his own.  The Anglicans and several other Protestant denominations still consider themselves Catholic in that they accept the literal life and death of Jesus as well as the Apostolic tradition while still rejecting the authority of the Pope.  The idea that Catholics aren't Christian is actually quite recent going back no more than to the 19th century and is largely limited to the Evangelical Churches and mostly in the U.S.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Catholics are Christians yes.  I think most other religions feel that because the Catholic church is more structured shall we say on its own that its not really a part of Christianity as a whole, but it is.  We believe in Christ the Savior and his word.  Catholics split off from the original church, whatever it was after Jesus died, just like every single other Christian denomination did at some point.  Its just that it had been used to maintain order over the centuries and other Christian denominations have split off of it out of disagreement over fundamentals.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	I never thought I would ever hear someone call the Catholics non Christian. <br>   It is a evil hateful thing  that some church leaders are doing .

Catholics go against every teaching of Jesus Christ.  For instance, Jesus taught that we are to keep the commandments of God; Catholics teach that we are not to keep them, that they have been "done away."  Jesus taught to live by every Word of God; Catholics teach that the Bible, the Word of God, is supplanted by their "Tradition."  The Bible teaches that we are not to worship God in the way that the heathen worship their gods; Catholics say they use heathen celebrations to worship God.  The Bible says the soul of the wicked will die for their sins; the Catholics say souls are immortal.  etc., etc., etc.,....<br>  <br>  Both Jesus and Paul taught that many would claim to be Christian and followers of Christ, but would would be teachers and followers of false christs, false gospels, false ministers, false apostles and false gods.<br>  <br>  BTW, I was raised Catholic too.

I'm Catholic, and we believe in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior. We worship God the Father and Him Alone. We know that the only means of salvation is through the Precious Blood of Jesus, shed on the Cross as the perfect sacrifice for our sins. We do NOT worship Mary, believe in a "false gospel of works," put the Pope above Jesus, or any of the other slanders that are brought against us.<br>  <br>  We know we're Christians, Jesus knows that we belong to Him, and what anybody else thinks is irrelevant -- if sometimes annoying. :)|`|oVHFz52Laa	They are Christians because they do not only believe in Christ but they also have the true Biblical Christ<br>  <br>  Everyone is not Christian who believe in Christ.

The Western church remained the Catholic Church and the Eastern became the Orthodox Church;<br>  - In the Middle-Ages, people began protesting about the way things were with the Catholic Church... those protesters became Protestants.<br>  - Those Protestants were spread all across Europe, so they all began their own churches, which took different names.<br>  - There were disputes within the new Churches... which brings us were we are now: a lot of churches who all follow Jesus Christ in their own way.

Rather they believe all of this is on earth and that there is nothing after death. Rather they believe the "paradise" of the earth belongs to the black man.<br>  <br>  And the list goes on and on.

4fffa6bae2775acc0a4469d4a0d63b20aa	No, we are steadily increasing as always!  You have probably just not been home when we've come by your house recently. :)  <br>  <br>  One very important detail to keep in mind is that we do not count everyone who calls themselves "one of Jehovah's Witnesses" in our numbers.  We only count those who are actively preaching, and who are qualified to actively preach (so if someone is not fitting the criteria outlined in the Bible for a minister, they are not considered active as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, even if they are calling themselves one).  And, our donations are all voluntary and anonymous, so "membership" is in no way based on monetary contributions, as is the process in many churches!<br>  <br>  That is really the opposite of what most religions do.  Many religions have hundreds of thousands of "members" on their books who, when polled, say they are not active in that religion.  <br>  <br>  In 2008, we had 7,124,443 qualified publishers in 236 lands put in 1,488,658,249 hours in the ministry.<br>  <br>  By the way, if you would like to learn more about us, please feel free to visit us at one of our Kingdom Halls, or check out our main website:  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/</a><br>  <br>  If you would like someone to visit you, you can fill out this "Would You Welcome a Visit?" form at:  <a href="https://watch002.securesites.net/contact/submit.htm" rel="nofollow">https://watch002.securesites.net/contact...</a> <br>  <br>  For information on the way our meetings are conducted, or what we are like, you might appreciate this link:  "Jehovah's Witnesses:  The People" <a href="http://www.jw-media.org/people/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jw-media.org/people/index.htm</a><br>  <br>  We are looking forward to speaking with you! :)<br>  <br>  PS - We have three official websites:  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/</a> (articles we have published about various things)<br>  <a href="http://www.jw-media.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jw-media.org/</a> (press releases, etc.)<br>  <a href="http://www.jw.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jw.org/</a> (audio downloads of literature, dramas and music)<br>  <br>  The url for the contact form is <a href="https://watch002.securesites.net/contact/submit.htm" rel="nofollow">https://watch002.securesites.net/contact...</a>  - you can also access the same form simply by clicking "Yes" in the Your Personal Invitation box at the lower right-hand side of the screen at <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/</a>|`|mrMkKFqNaa	They are still growing.  As someone else noted, the JW religion has a "revolving door" character, as evidenced by the 37% retention rate from the 2008 Pew Survey.<br>  <br>  But in terms of "zeal" and visibility, the JWs of today do not measure up to the JWs of the past.  In the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, JWs were out there in public picketing in front of churches on Sunday mornings with placards and signs that "Religion is a Snare and a Racket."  How many American JWs would have the courage to picket in front of their neighbors' chuches?<br>  <br>  Today's Witnesses are much more timid.  My experience is that they want to just leave a piece of literature and be on their way (of course I'm sure that there is plenty of variance among JWs in their technique).|`|MGDPPJkLaa	There's an AP news story out March 10 saying that most major religions are reporting a decline in membership, but Jehovah's Witnesses are up 2 percent: <a href="http://www.vindy.com/news/2009/mar/10/membership-decline-reported-in-largest-churches/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vindy.com/news/2009/mar/10/me...</a>|`|Xt9wIj4Iaa	JWs still go house to house.

(Psalm 37:9-11) Those in God's memory will be resurrected and will enjoy perfect health. (Acts 24:15) By their faithfulness to God, obedient mankind will be granted what our original parents lost—everlasting life in human perfection on a paradise earth.—Revelation 21:3, 4.<br>  <br>  In the Bible book of Isaiah, we get a preview of what life will be like in the Paradise earth. No inhabitant of Paradise will say, "I am sick." (Isaiah 33:24) Animals will pose no danger to man. (Isaiah 11:6-9) People will build beautiful homes and inhabit them and will plant crops and eat to satisfaction. (Isaiah 65:21-25) Moreover, God "will actually swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces."—Isaiah 25:8.<br>  <br>  Soon, obedient mankind will live under such blessed conditions. They "will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God." (Romans 8:21) How wonderful it will be to live forever in the promised earthly Paradise! (Luke 23:43) You can be there if you act upon accurate knowledge of the Scriptures and exercise faith in Jehovah God and Jesus Christ. And you can have confidence that it does make sense to believe in a paradise earth.|`|IGu4bx51aa	Many people have guard dogs these days and security camera too So it's not as easy for them to sneak up to the door like they did in bygone days <br>  Spread the word Tell me about it .................It's a cult<br>  Personal best is sixteen btw|`|MSHxYrLEaa	we have a book called 'what does the bible really teach'<br>  <br>  over the last 4 years, over 90 million have been given out free of charge<br>  <br>  its increasing ;)|`|NWa45ZDIaa	No, we're not declining at all, we're increasing in number actually. There is now over 7 million of us all over the world. Perhaps you may not have seen the Witnesses in your area lately. Some areas there are less JW's then others, so calling as often is harder to do, but it IS done. If you would like to ever talk to them personally, you can always ask to speak to us, Look up your local Kingdom Hall & call them personally, or you can go to the official website: <a href="http://www.watchtower.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org</a> & request a visit, or even do research about us on the search engine at the top right hand corner of that website. I suggest this article for starters since you asked specifically about JW's. <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/jt/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/jt/index.htm</a><br>  <br>  Also, please disregard the absurd rant & false stories about JW's that you will get here. Y!A has a small group of JW haters that are intent on misleading sincere people from truth about us. If you want to know about JW's, ask a JW. That way you'll get accurate answers & truth about JW's. So be wary of "those" people.<br>  <br>  Take care!|`|kiOjChe6aa	yea i haven't seen them in awhile?|`|JZxZ8mKRaa	In my city, we are growing.<br>  <br>  And we are still out there calling on the doors - other than in ridiculous winter weather or ice storms that left us with no electric, no passage on roads, no telephones, etc.<br>  <br>  But spring has come, so we are gearing up to enjoy the better weather while we cover all our neighborhoods.<br>  <br>  Watch for us in the next couple weeks.

People keep odd hours more and more.|`|AA11703455	No, we are still out there!<br>  <br>  In the USA, the number of Witnesses are over 1,100,000 (as of August 08) (that is publishers that share in the ministry) and grew 2% last year. <br>  <br>  The recent ARIS says that based on their survey, we are up to .08 percent of the population, or 1,914,000. (that is an increase of a little over 530,000 over the past 18 years) I trust our numbers, since that is based on hard numbers, not a survey of 50,000 people and their opinions. <br>  <br>  In our area, we have had 3 new congregations formed over the past 10 years, so now there are 8 in our town. There are another 6 in the county. Our county has about 140,000 population. <br>  <br>  We have two main web sites, one you can find information and many of the articles are online, in up to 376 languages.

(The "37% retention rate" claim is pure garbage.) We now number of 7,000,000 active Kingdom proclaimers in over 235 lands around the world. We still engage in our public door-to-door work, but we are also making use of various other methods in order to reach as many as we can with Bible's message (of hope, and of warning). <br>  <br>  If you're curious about what Jehovah's Witnesses believe, feel free to call up the local congregation and ask whatever questions you have of someone there, or you can go to the official Jehovah's Witness website at: www.watchtower.org and you can skim through a variety of topics to see what we believe and why. <br>  <br>  (FYI:     Just so you know, when you ask a question directly at Jehovah's Witnesses, you're going to receive quite a few comments from the anti-JW cult. You'll know them when you see them. They include CJ (aka Winkleman, aka Loblaw, etc...), UL, Nina BG, Chuck, and a few others. Their purpose is to slander and lie against our faith and steer you in a way of misinformation and inaccurate information.)|`|AA10671142	that is not true, we are growing everyday in number. more and more people want to worship Jehovah God. we are in 235 lands worldwide

But I were to get a physical from a man- even though he was old and unattractive, it would be arousing. But don't stress about it much. Attraction and what feels good to you are 2 diff. things. If you're curious about your sexuality, then explore it a little.|`|hMNOBYHCaa	This alone doesn't suggest you're gay.  Physical arousal is hard to avoid in males.  You're built that way...you get touched and you get aroused.  I think it's just a sign that you're a normal horny teen age boy.  Ask yourself if you find men in general alluring, or if that was an isolated instance.  It's likely that you would have felt some kind of stirrings before if you were really gay.|`|aK623aiQaa	o yEAH THE DOCTOR SAID THE SAME THING TO ME WOW YOU GOT  A BIG PACKAGE THEIR AND IM ONLY 15 YEARS OLD!!!!!!!!!!!

This is a horrible crime, if he was alert and in his mind then he should receive what ever punishment is appropriate, also if his mind was influenced that would render another sentencing.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	I think that we should not let fear dictate our lives.<br>  <br>  We should morn for our lost brother, but we should never be afraid to allow new people into our churches.|`|psWY3ZnWaa	Let us first find out if the young man in question was in his right mind or was deranged from mental or physical illness before making such decisions. <br>  <br>  I think the deceased pastor, if he could speak, would want that much grace shown to his attacker.
XwQxKwRcaa	Jesus is nothing more than the symbol they drag around with them while they push their right wing agenda. <br>  <br>  Some will deny it, like the first couple of answers here, because they are in the middle of it.

Should Christians hate gays or anyone else? no. Should Christians hate sin- any sin, including homosexuality? yes. Do Christians get preoccupied by issues? yes. Does that get blown up in our culture?  Should they hate gentiles? Not sure where this comes from, but, if you ever hear somebody say this, you have my permission to laugh at them and then question their seriousness. Not many Christians can claim to be true blue Jews, which, if we aren't true blue Jews, then we're gentiles.  I hope this helps.|`|rU6nh42Eaa	His followers don't hate anyone.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|nH0n4D5zaa	i honestly don't know if i do or not. still undecided. <br>  <br>  i do however, think that too many people think about what happens after they die, that they miss out on life. <br>  <br>  so forget about what happens after you stop living, LIVE while your living, and god damnit, ENJOY IT!|`|b164e8d4d76ceb0d7f6bd403bdc7ecd8aa	No, I don't.

Before this, I had been suspicious of her supposed friendships with some men she worked with.|`|fEgM6q6iaa	I've got to say that in my experience you aren't being paranoid. There are times when these relationships do work, but remember that if she could do it to him, while professing her undying love to him - she can do it to you. But - give it a chance and see what happens - just be willing to risk the consequences. If you love her enough - you'll be prepared to put the past where it belongs. I'd still be weary though|`|118h96Q8aa	I think that instead of asking us, you should ask her why she chose that month.

If she is engaged to you, why does she have to keep the ex in her life?  I don't know many people that would be comfortable with that.  And, I would insist on the wedding date being changed to a different month.  It really sounds like to me that she is still "holding" on to the ex.  She needs to let him go.  Completely let him go.  You know, once you break up that should be it!  Especially when you are engaged to marry someone else.  But, that is only my opinion.  I don't want to make "issues" for you.  But she needs to stop being involved in anyway with her ex.  And change that wedding date.  I hope I could help!|`|rU6nh42Eaa	First of all, there are only 12 months in the year, and every month has some significance if you search for it.<br>  <br>  I would be very wary.  Any person who still has feelings for her ex and he does too, and they continue to communicate with each other in any way except when they happen to meet in public is not to be trusted.  You are a blessing because you got her out of one situation and into a love affair.  Some people get beyond it, but if you cheated on one person by finding another, you've already broken down that barrier.  It won't be hard the next time, because you or she will be in love with someone else.  Her "gratitude" for her last husband shows she still is connected to him.  She wants both worlds.  It would help if you two never had contact with the ex again, but I still don't trust either of you to not stray.

Sn0CViR7aa	As your history demonstrates, baptism does not take away free will, nor is it sufficient for salvation.  <br>  <br>  By baptism we are born into God's family, set free from original sin, and take God as our father and all baptized Christians as brothers and sisters.  We still have other important responsibilities, e.g., obeying God's commandments, practicing charity, eating the bread of life, and enduring until the end.<br>  <br>  The original Christians practiced infant baptism. In Acts we learn that whole families were baptized, which certainly included minor children.  This refutes the recent Protestant claim that baptism is simply a public declaration of a decision for Christ.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Bruce|`|FmazIF6Maa	Baptism is a ritual Catholics believe remove original sin. <br>  <br>  It's also a rite of passage in which parents make the committment to raise their child Catholic, and in which Godparents are chosen to be the people who will take care of the child if the parent's die. <br>  <br>  Contrary to Protestant believe, a Catholic baptism was never supposed to be a child deciding to dedicate his life to God. That occurs at confirmation, a sacrament that comes later at an age of accountability.<br>  <br>  <br>  Baptisms are not a waste of time, it is a communal celebration welcoming new life into the world.|`|2JbCMKNAaa	There is none.

What we are told is that a person MUST believe the Gospel in order to be "born again," and then we MUST repent of our sins (only THEN can we be baptized).

The reasons are very clear in Scriptures.<br>  <br>  (Joh 3:5 DRB) Jesus answered: Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.<br>  <br>  To the first Christians that baptized their children it was understood by them that Baptism is the doorway to salvation. St. Peter said the following:<br>  <br>  (1Pe 3:18 DRB) Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust: that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit,<br>  <br>  (1Pe 3:19 DRB) In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison:<br>  <br>  (1Pe 3:20 DRB) Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.<br>  <br>  (1Pe 3:21 DRB) Whereunto baptism, being of the like form, now saveth you also: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but, the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  The effects of Baptism are the regeneration of the soul (born again), eradication of original sin and actual sin and its effects on the soul. A baby does not have actual sin but does have original sin. Through Baptism we become members of the Body of Christ, of which St. Paul says the following:<br>  <br>  (2Co 5:17 DRB) If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are passed away. Behold all things are made new.<br>  <br>  (1Co 3:16 DRB) Know you not that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<br>  <br>  Baptism is the sacramental doorway into the Church: <br>  <br>  (Mat 28:19 DRB) Going therefore, teach ye all nations: baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  The Bible teaches that everyone should be Baptized:<br>  <br>  (Act 2:38 DRB) But Peter said to them: Do penance: and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins. And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  (Act 2:39 DRB) For the promise is to you and to your children and to all that are far off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call.<br>  <br>  (Act 2:40 DRB) And with very many other words did he testify and exhort them, saying: Save yourselves from this perverse generation.<br>  <br>  (Act 2:41 DRB) They therefore that received his word were baptized: and there were added in that day about three thousand souls.<br>  <br>  (Act 2:42 DRB) And they were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles and in the communication of the breaking of bread and in prayers.<br>  <br>  St. Peter at Pentecost said to the adults to repent but did not exclude children from Baptism, instead saying that everyone should receive the Holy Spirit not just those of age to repent. He said it is “to you and to your children”. That is why people in the early Church brought even their smallest children to be baptized as do parents today. <br>  <br>  There is no necessity to repent for children to be Baptized according to Scriptures. The command to repent is not binding on infants nor to mentally incapacitated people as the intent of repentance is not to exclude those incapable of such an act. They are not to be condemned because of their lack of ability to repent. Certainly the same understanding should apply as we understand St. Paul’s statement in 2 Thessalonians 3:10 where St. Paul says that someone who does not work does not eat. Are we to deny children or the mentally handicapped sustenance? Certainly they should not, nor should they be denied eternal life.<br>  <br>  The Old Testament required circumcision at eight days old as a sign of the covenant of God. The child had no knowledge of why he was being circumcised yet the parents brought the son to the synagogue to have this done. God accepted the child into the covenant for what the parents had done just as He accepts the Baptism when the parents present their child to be baptized. The Scriptures tell us clearly that Baptism replaced circumcision:<br>  <br>  (Col 2:11 DRB) In whom also you are circumcised with circumcision not made by hand in despoiling of the body of the flesh: but in the circumcision of Christ.<br>  <br>  (Col 2:12 DRB) Buried with him in baptism: in whom also you are risen again by the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him up from the dead.<br>  <br>  We must remember what Christ said when there were those who attempted to forbid the children from coming to Him:<br>  <br>  (Luk 18:15 DRB) And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.<br>  <br>  (Luk 18:16 DRB) But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.<br>  <br>  (Luk 18:17 DRB) Amen, I say to you: Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child shall not enter into it.<br>  <br>  Can there be any doubt by a proper understanding of Scripture that children should be baptized? Certainly a complete understanding of the Scriptural verses shows clearly that children have the same need for Baptism as adults and that they should not be held away from this act by their parents or the Church lest they put the child in grave danger and the parents and/or Church are disobedient to the spirit of the teaching of Jesus and the apostles.<br>  <br>  In Christ <br>  Fr. Joseph|`|M7QpoNf4aa	Well, my good friend, its a thing people like to call faith. Because you are an atheist, you don't understand the full meaning. I am still a catholic. As catholics, we believe that when a child is baptized, he/she is welcomed into the church and into God's love just as God was baptized. So it is a big part of my catholic faith. <br>  <br>  I am not making fun of you or am against atheists, but i would rather play it safe, worship God and if there is a heaven, get to it. and laugh at those who said there was no God. If there is no God, then i just die and nothing happens, but i wont care because i am dead. Rather than not believing in God, and having no chance at heaven, so it makes more sense to believe in God. I don't believe everything the catholic church says, but i do believe in God and in the words of Dane Cook "when you die, nothing happens".|`|xp6UVyj2aa	Because its the best way to get them to do it willingly. Im pissed my parents had me baptized catholic im athiest. I think it should be a descion to make when your older i have no problem with people that choose other religions, but they should be able to make the choice when they get older and know why they chose it and what it means, rather than being forced into something you may not want when you get older.|`|2LOa12xEaa	Of course you see it as useless.

I am a witness.  But if you study scripture you will learn that God answers prayers if the answer will benefit, and when the person praying has faith.

Part of the reason is that I'm not very attractive physically, and I very much like to be alone most of the time.<br>  <br>  I am uncomfortable with the fact that I've never had a girlfriend.<br>  <br>  I believe that until most girls are are least 16 they won't really KNOW what to look for in a relationship. <br>  <br>  Kids around 14 are usually dating because they think it's "cool." The older kids do it, so they copy them. <br>  <br>  You sound more mature than other girls your age, as you recognize that having a relationship based on physical attraction isn't the only thing you want.<br>  <br>  Most girls that young date because the physical attraction they feel toward a guy is so new. They've probably never felt it before, but they think that it's love.<br>  <br>  Boys who are around 14 years old are only just going through puberty. They find knew pleasure in looking at a girl's figure.<br>  <br>  Basically, they're getting horny. Boys REALLY tend to not know that relationships need to be more than physical. All they want to do is get off.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying you should ignore the boys, or stop looking for a boyfriend. <br>  <br>  I think you should use your own judgment to decide if you want to date someone. I'm telling you now that you're unlikely to find a good boy who would appreciate you liking him for his personality.<br>  <br>  My cousin was 14 or 15 when she started dating her boyfriend, and they've been together for 3 or 4 years now.

UinOWcMUaa	The Kaaba was a house of worship originally built by the Prophey Abraham and his son in Mecca. After many generations passed, the Arabs fell into ignorance and began idol worship, placing their idols witin the Kaaba. Many tribes from far and wide came to the Kaaba for worship, and so Mecca began to thrive as a trade city for many societies. When Prophet Muhammad established the religion of Islam, he broke all the idols in the Kaaba. At this time, Muslims were praying towards Jerusalem, but then revelation came from God, and Muslims were told to pray towards the Kaaba. This shows that the designation of direction of prayer doesn't mean that we are worshipping that place or the Black Stone--God is everywhere! We just need one unifying factor, to show discipline.<br>  <br>  The Black stone is said to have been used by Prophet Abraham to build the original Kaaba, which is why when it was rebuilt, the Balck stone was given such significance and a place of honor. But we do not pray towars the Black Stone! <br>  <br>  "We decreed your former qiblah (direction of prayer) only in order that We might know the Prophet's true adherents and those who were to disown him. It was indeed a hard test but not for those whom Allah guided." (Surah al-Baqarah 2:143 )<br>  This verse shows another reason for praying towards the Kaaba--to know the true followers of Islam from the hypocrites.<br>  <br>  We also perform Hajj (pilgrimage) to the Kaaba because this is what Prophet Abraham had done. He was commanded by God to call all of the people to gather for worship. To this day, millions of muslims answer his call, and come to the Kaaba to worship together.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: He didn't.  Muslims were praying towards Jerusalem, following the lead of their prophet until Jews refused to convert and it ticked Mohammad off and he turned against the Jews and rewrote the Torah and got quite a bit of it wrong.

Thus, the questions on the lips of many reverts is: ‘can I keep my dog while still abiding by my religious obligations? Will my new religion take away from me my dog, which has become my closest friend?’<br>  <br>  What makes this issue so debated is the fact that there are many Prophetic hadiths that warn Muslims about getting into contact with dogs. In fact, some of these hadiths give warnings that going against this rule takes away a sizeable amount of reward from a person’s record (of good deeds) daily. Adding to that is the Prophet’s order for killing the dogs in Medina and the Angel Gabriel’s refusal to enter the Prophet’s house in one of his visits, citing the presence of dog as reason.<br>  <br>  But alongside with this, are many hadiths that call for showing kindness to animals in general, including dogs, and the permissibility of keeping dogs for hunting, guarding, etc. It’s further reported that some of the Prophet’s companions, may Allah be pleased with them all, were in the habit of keeping animals for farming purposes or even for fun and pleasure.<br>  <br>  So to clarify this confusion, we need to interpret those hadiths in the light of the Qur’an. The Qur'an makes it clear that there is no harm in eating animals grabbed by hunting dogs. Furthermore, it’s through the Qur'an that we get acquainted with the story of the Cave Companions (ahl-ul-khaf) who had with them their dog; this clearly shows that dogs have historically been used for guarding the person and the property of its owners.<br>  <br>  This also indicates that dogs must be treated well they are of the animals referred to in the verse:<br>  <br>      There is not an animal (that lives) on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but (forms part of) communities like you.<br>  <br>      Surah 6 Verse 38<br>  <br>  The implicit message of this verse is that in Islam, the concept of mercy covers humans as well as animals, for Islam accords animals inviolable rights, part of which is to be fed well and not to be subject to torture or ill-treatment. Hence, I recall here the hadith in which the Prophet (pbuh), stated that a woman was doomed to enter Hell because of a cat...<br>  <br>  ‘which she neither fed nor let it eat from the vermin of the earth.’<br>  <br>  This hadith makes it clear that Islam does not go against keeping animals, including watch or hunting dogs, as long as one does not neglect them. In fact, the Prophet (pbuh) states that showing kindness to animals is a means of earning reward:<br>  <br>  ‘In every living being there is reward.’<br>  <br>  Adding to this is the hadith in which the Prophet (pbuh) told his companions a story concerning a man who found a dog in the desert panting and licking the dust due to thirst. The man went to a well, filled his shoes with water, and relieved the dog's thirst. Said the messenger of Allah (pbuh):<br>  <br>  ‘Allah appreciated this and forgave him all his sins.’ (Reported by al-Bukhari)<br>  <br>  Having said this, we have to ask: ‘How is it that the religion that is rich in all these fine precepts about animal rights, is the same religion that warns its followers about getting into contact with dogs and even emphasizes that the utensils licked by dogs should be washed 7 times, one of them with earth?’<br>  <br>  The answer is very simple. The basic rule in Islam is the permissibility of keeping dogs for hunting and guarding. Still, the exception to the rule is: excessiveness must be avoided as much as possible. The care and concern for human beings should take higher priority over the care of animals, and the reward for that is greater.<br>  <br>  We will be able to understand this fact, when we notice that some people do pay a great deal of attention to their cats and dogs, at the expense of other things. It is better for Muslims to make the best use of their time in that which is beneficial and good. Some people spend more money on their cats and dogs, than they spend on their own sons and daughters! Then, let alone the poor and needy. They may even bring their pets to stay in luxurious hotels and bequeath large amounts of money to them.<br>  <br>  You see, sister, going to extremes in showering dogs with love, concern and kindness, is what shari’a goes against, because there should be no collision between human rights and animal rights. Thus, in observing how lavishly the well-off treat their dogs while despising their relatives, and how much attention they give their dogs while neglecting their neighbors, one realizes the wisdom of the cautious approach the shari’a has towards this issue.<br>  <br>  It’s also due to the danger that the dogs posed at a certain time during the lifetime of the Prophet (pbuh), that he ordered for the killing of the dogs, but he later rescinded this order. As we know, stray dogs pose as a nuisance and health hazard. They tend to defecate indiscriminately in the open, thereby posing a danger for childr|`|E0lMycUeaa	i agree with pink<br>  <br>  as scholars allow it as a guard<br>  <br>  look you can have detail answer if you ask ur question in ramadan section<br>  <br>  > Society & Culture >Religion & Spirituality >holidays>ramdan|`|ajXkKnB0aa	It's not wise to name your food and let it sleep in the house with you.|`|hceSZoAkaa	no its not but you shoudnt have the dog in the house

Genesis 6 states they existed before the sons of God married the daughters of man. Whether the "sons of God" refers to fallen angels or a line from Seth is not known although angels are not thought to be capable of having sexual relations. Some people propose that they were an attempt by Satan to alter human genetics with fallen angels and thus cut off the promised Messiah's lineage back to Adam...it's a little shaky theory though. Noah was called "perfect" in his generations which means that he was a direct descendant from Adam but his extended family may have had genetic ties to pre-Flood Nephilim.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.new-life.net/faq014.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.new-life.net/faq014.htm</a>|`|Rsww6L5qaa	They didn't survive the flood.  The flood was a judgment to anyone who was unwilling to repent of their sins and get on the Ark.  <br>  <br>  The Nephilim reappeared because the daughters of men after the flood (women) continued to have relations with the Sons of God (demons).  The word Nephilim can be literally translated as "those who cause others to stumble.  Their hearts were filled with violence and cared nothing about the things of God.<br>  <br>  The Nephilim continued to be a problem up until the time of King David.  Goliath is considered to be one of the last of the Nephilim. God dealt with them by ordering the Israelites to wipe them out.  The reason we don't see Nephilim today is because God dealt directly with the demons involved with relations with women.  In 2 Peter and in Jude it says that God locked them up in everlasting chains in darkness until their day oof judgment.  Apparently this punishment was so bad that not a single demon would dare repeat it.|`|kX0T1urdaa	They didn't. The devil has to keep trying. That is what he does. The fallen angels tried it again after the flood. <br>  <br>  That is one of the reasons God commanded the Israelites to kill all, every man, woman and child. It was because they were tainted by the blood of fallen angels.<br>  <br>  He promised not to send another flood so it was up to the Israelites to get rid of them. David killed one when he killed Goliath. Goliath had 5 brothers. Later David and his men killed them also. It is in the book of 2 Samuel.

Mom is too passive. She has allowed this child to rule her. I would imagine this isn't the first time he has slapped,probably kicked and other abuse to her. She has allowed this by her behavior. If you listen to what the child was saying, he is begging her for respect. He is acting out his anger towards her because she is not listening to him. It's not to late for her to change her attitude towards him and he towards her. But she and he needs professional help. It's hard to see these behaviors between parents and child. But who is to blame here...It's not initially the child. I know that is hard to hear from a lot of folks, but mom is the one who allowed this behavior. I hope Dr. Phil continued after the show working with this family. If he did.....they are still fixable

If your truly born again child of God, you have nothing to fear.  If your not, this demonic spirit could cause you lots of problems.<br>  <br>  In either case, prayer is the answer.  If your are truly saved, you should go through your house, claiming each and every room for the Lord Jesus Christ and command and evil spirit to leave and not come back.  <br>  <br>  If you are not saved, you should find a Christian who is truly saved and have them do this for you.

Heaven forbid we might miss a few mins of American Idol or Next top model or some sports game on tv..... whew.<br>  I know men that can list the full statistics of any player in the NFL off the top of his head without as much as a thought.... but cant name the twelve Apostles. And these are christian men I am talking about..... its truly a shame.|`|dX8qCoJ3aa	Actually atheists tend to give us thumbs down the second they learn your a Christian.
ryIMTXrRaa	I have no problem with it. If other belief systems are allowed to broadcast themselves, atheism should be able to as well. Different perspectives never hurt anyone.|`|bc31594d662102e5c53e9da54ca5195baa	I'd consider it a waste of money. I don't care if someone believes<br>  in God, little green aliens or the wood witch.

But, it's their right to post messages like those, I guess. :'(|`|AA10007956	I'm a Christian, although I don't like announcing it to everyone in the world - but for this case, its probably better I do state that.<br>  <br>  I don't see anything wrong for atheists to state their beliefs, just as I don't see anything wrong with Christians to spread the Word of God.<br>  <br>  Anyway, its all in the name of lightening up. Some of us Christians are a little too uptight anyway.<br>  Enjoying life sometimes probably is something many of us forget to do, but of course, enjoying it responsibly is the right way to go. :)<br>  <br>  I respect atheists as much as I respect the next fellow man because I too was an atheist before being a born again Christian and it wasn't because I hated God but because I was looking for Him, looking for answers to questions and I didn't want to declare a belief simply because.<br>  <br>  Many atheists are very intelligent, rational and questioning people, and taking a religion at face value is something they would never do.

Believers or Non-Believers? im curious....because who said believers don't enjoy life i have the best life i could possibly wish for....i enjoy waking everyday talking to god...<br>   My biggest answer to non believers when they ask why should i believe is "if there is a god we have gained everything by serving him if there isn't what have we lost nothing maybe 2 hours a week going to church"...i wish people could understand this...Doing these signs on the buses is just as hurtful and terrible as putting down a race.|`|7cjn2u9uaa	It seems more agnostic to me because they say there's "probably" no God. Not "There's no God"|`|SuBRC6BJaa	I feel it would be hypocritical of Christians to disapprove of these ads.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	Aside from the word "probably", I think it's a great message.<br>  Unfortunately, it would likely never be allowed n the U.S. It's not illegal here, but few companies are willing to risk dealing with the public backlash and negative publicity for promoting any speech that's critical towards religion.|`|akoqXxZPaa	I think it's great, we finally get acknowledged by society and get to speak for ourselves|`|kFpFU97zaa	Well.... when it comes to public things like this, it's an all or none attitude for me.

This spirit usually is around people who fall asleep in places one should not sleep. It wakes you by rubbing up against you, thus waking you up. This is normal.

KTKxrP7naa	Given that all children around the world learn languages at about the same pace, we can be pretty sure that no language is really that much harder or easier than any other. However, if languages are closely related, then it'll be easier to move from one to another, but this is because of the linguistic proximity not because of any inherent difficulty or ease.<br>  <br>  Japanese pronunciation is generally fairly easy for speakers of many languages: few conjunct consonants, lots of consonant-vowel combintions. Verb formation is regular but complex. The writing system is very hard. Japanese speakers find that pronunciation in English is harder: it has more phonemes than does Japanese and also allows more consonant combinations.

All those cells are disposed of anyway as they are created in the test tube and there's no way 99% of them will ever come to term because they'll never be implanted.

If you do, have them look up the amount of time he ased the same question.<br>  <br>  You got a thumbs up from me, too.  You handled him well.  Most folks would've told him something that REALLY would have gotten their account suspended!<br>  <br>  I also read your answer about would you still be with your girl if she changed into the opposite sex.  I say, it depends on the people involved.  Doesn't make you homophobic.  I wouldn't want my wife to turn into a man, & honestly don't know what I'd do.|`|e0e02336b485c5330b6b15ff4bc7a6d9aa	He did ask like 19 - 20 times..I think by the community guidelines his account could be suspended. And you will only get suspended if people report you. Your answer wasn't inappropriate and you technically answered the question, so don't worry about it. He looks like he has self-esteem issues though. He seems to be utterly convinced he will not get into college and has a lot of girl problems. Start reporting his questions next time he asks, his account will be deleted.|`|SIFyxFFpaa	i just gave your reply a thumbs up.<br>  <br>  he needed to be ***** slapped, just like a few around here.<br>  <br>  welcome if you want to join.  just be nice, and all will be gold!|`|6rHhrcWGaa	seems just fine to me that you did that, I recall seeing that question before|`|r6fGmJK1aa	Welcome!  <br>  That is lame compared to what goes on in here!|`|UbvglIS6aa	I don't think you're going to get suspended over this.|`|420d72e7d945fb5cb4d470808614f009aa	I doubt you will get suspended.

You are not going to get suspended.|`|oY4vwdjVaa	one violation isn't going to get you suspended - ask anyone in THIS section. lol|`|6ELSwKKvaa	No, you will not get suspended over this. This is actually a minor rant and no one has even reported it yet as you have no thumbs down. (which is an indicator if someone has reported it... it automatically gives you a thumbs down if it gets reported.) The worst that would happen with this particular issue is that it might get deleted and that is it. You will get a violation notice and it's no big deal. <br>  <br>     You get suspended for big infractions like cheating to get more points or more best answers and such. Also, if you get a ton of answers or questions reported then they will freeze you for that too. One reported answer will not get you deleted or frozen so relax. Four won't get you frozen either.

I vote for who I feel is the best candidate. So far there have been no good candidates for president who are atheists.

UinOWcMUaa	To understand this Biblical term, it is necessary to understand that there are TWO BIRTHS. The "first" birth is the PHYSICAL BIRTH when you were born into this world from your mother and father. When the Bible speaks of being "born of water," it is speaking about the physical birth (NOT baptism). The "second" birth is a SPIRITUAL BIRTH, which means to be born of the "Spirit" (God's Holy Spirit). This raises a couple of questions: Why does a person need to be born spiritually?...and, What is a "spiritual" birth?<br>  <br>  The Bible teaches that man is created in the image of God. God manifests Himself to mankind in the Persons of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Likewise, mankind is composed of a body, soul, and spirit. Our body is the "tent" you could say of the soul and spirit (the body is a temporary dwelling place). Our soul is composed of the heart (to feel), the mind (to think), and the will (to decide). Our spirit is dead in sin when we are born; that is, we are born void of God. No person is ever born with God. The only exception is the Lord Jesus Christ Who came as God in the flesh (1st Timothy 3:16). Our spirit is dead in trespasses and sin the Bible says...|`|AA11849917	When the spirit within a person has been revitalized (sin "killed" the spirit within, for "the wages of sin is death" - spiritual death NOW, and eternal death later), but if the spirit within the person has been revitalized by the power of God's Holy Spirit taking up residence within his or her spirit, that person has been "born again."<br>  <br>  It requires one to admit their guilt before God (not before a man), asking God to forgive him or her, and repenting of our sin.<br>  <br>  Then God can (and does) grant that person an undeserved and unmerited pardon that he or she could NEVER earn, and cleanses that person's heart (spiritually speaking), and adopts him or her into His Forever Family.<br>  <br>  When that occurs, the person is "born again" - born of the Spirit.|`|DzGKfdKnaa	The greek word "anothen" used in Jesus' quote has 2 meanings. No need to panic "ma?ana" has 2 meanings in Spanish (morning, or tomorrow), lots of words do.<br>  <br>  Now back to being born "anothen" one meaning is "again" and the other is "from above" I.E. from heaven.<br>  <br>  I believe Jesus chose a double-meaning word on purpose. That is why he said "Do not be amazed when I say you have to be born anothen" (amazed used to mean confused). Because how crazy would it be to come out of your mom again?

(John 3:16) So, believing on the Lord Jesus makes someone "born again".<br>  <br>  Paul answered the jailor's question "What must I do to be saved?" with the answer "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household." (Acts 16:30-31)<br>  <br>  To believe on the Lord Jesus for your salvation is different from what James wrote about believing in one God in James 2:19. The context of James' writing is about faith being demonstrated in action when we first believe God makes us righteous - "And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, 'Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.'" (James 2:23)<br>  <br>  Hence, Paul explained how confessing with our mouth the Lord Jesus and believing in our heart that God has raised Him from the dead is the same as receiving salvation. (Romans 10:9-10) All it takes is faith in Jesus, and the person receives forgiveness of sins and right standing with God, and the Holy Spirit dwells in the believer forever. (John 14:16-17)<br>  <br>  (God made it easy for us to be born again because Jesus has done the hardest part for us - by dying for our sins at the cross. Our part is simply to believe on Him, and we will receive salvation ("soteria") - wholeness in every area of our lives.)<br>  <br>  Paul wrote about the Holy Spirit dwelling in a believer upon being born again in Ephesians 1:13-14 "In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory." The Holy Spirit seals the believer for the day of redemption - that is, when Jesus returns to rapture the church. (Ephesians 4:30)<br>  <br>  To be born again, in essence, is to identify oneself with the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus - we died with Jesus at the cross who bore the punishment for all our sins, we were buried with Him, and on the third day, we were raised together with Him without our sins, having been justified or declared not guilty by God.<br>  <br>  "Who was delivered up because of our offenses, and was raised because of our justification" (Romans 4:25)<br>  <br>  "Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism unto death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in the newness of life." (Romans 6:4)<br>  <br>  "And you, being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses" (Colossians 2:13)<br>  <br>  Once you are born again, you are a new creation in Christ. You were raised from the dead with Christ, having His righteousness imputed to you. "For God made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him." (2 Corinthians 5:21) You are now the righteousness of God in Christ, and you can stand boldly in God's presence, without guilt, shame or condemnation, all because of Jesus' finished work.<br>  <br>  The website below was shared by my girlfriend.

4fffa6bae2775acc0a4469d4a0d63b20aa	The 'woman' is Jehovah God's wife-like heavenly organization, the mother of his spirit-anointed servants on earth. (Gal. 4:26)  Her seed is primarily Jesus Christ, who would bruise Satan in the head by eventually crushing him out of existence.  There are also anointed ones who are a subsidiary part of that seed of promise, that began to be added from Pentecost 33 C.E. onward. (John 3:3, 5; Gal. 3:16, 29; Rev. 12:9, 10; 20:10)  Satan's seed is his offspring - demons and humans as well as human organizations that manifest the traits of Satan and show enmity toward the "seed" of the woman. (John 15:19; 17:15)<br>  <br>  It is interesting to note that this first prophecy showed that Jehovah God's purpose for the earth had not changed.  You may appreciate the information presented in this article for more information on that:<br>  <br>  "Why Does God Permit Suffering?" <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/200611/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/200611/artic...</a>|`|e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	Woman=Jehovah's heavenly organization<br>  Seed= Primarily Christ along with his anointed brothers (144,000 bought from the earth)<br>  Satan's Seed= anyone or anything in opposition to Jehovah and His kingdom arrangement; spirit, human or organization|`|UinOWcMUaa	According to this view, the passage gives the first hint of the gospel. Satan delivers a crippling blow to the Seed of the woman (Jesus), who in turn delivers a fatal blow to the Serpent (first defeating him through the death and resurrection [1 Cor 15:55-57] and then destroying him in the judgment [Rev 12:7-9; 20:7-10]).|`|AA10116612	The WOMAN'S seed is Jesus !<br>  <br>  Satan's seed will ultimately be the Anti Christ|`|3aVxJYf6aa	The “woman” of Genesis 3:15. At the time that he sentenced humankind’s parents, Adam and Eve, God gave the promise of a seed that would be brought forth by the “woman,” and who would crush the serpent’s head. (Ge 3:15) Here was a “sacred secret” that God purposed to reveal in his due time. (Col 1:26) Some factors in the circumstances existing at the time of the prophetic promise provide clues as to the ‘woman’s’ identity. Since her seed was to crush the serpent’s head, he would have to be more than a human seed, for the Scriptures show that it was not to a literal snake on the ground that God’s words were aimed. The “serpent” is shown at Revelation 12:9 to be Satan the Devil, a spirit person. Consequently, the “woman” of the prophecy could not be a human woman, such as Mary the mother of Jesus. The apostle sheds light on the matter at Galatians 4:21-31.—See SEED.<br>  <br>  In this passage the apostle speaks of Abraham’s free wife and of his concubine Hagar and says that Hagar corresponds to the literal city of Jerusalem under the Law covenant, her “children” being the citizens of the Jewish nation. Abraham’s wife Sarah, Paul says, corresponds to “the Jerusalem above,” who is the spiritual mother of Paul and his spirit-begotten associates. This heavenly “mother” would be also the “mother” of Christ, who is the oldest among his spiritual brothers, all of whom spring from God as their Father.—Heb 2:11,?12<br>  <br>  Seed of the woman’ spiritual. Accordingly, regardless of how faithful men of old may have viewed the matter, it becomes clear, in the light of the Christian Scriptures, that the promised ‘seed of the woman’ would have to be more than human in order to ‘bruise in the head’ this spiritual enemy, this angelic person, the Devil. The “seed” would have to be a mighty spirit person. How would he be provided, and who would be his ‘mother,’ the “woman”?<br>  <br>  The next recorded mention of the promised “seed” came over 2,000 years later, to faithful Abraham. Abraham was of the line of Shem, and in an earlier prophecy Noah had spoken of Jehovah as “Shem’s God.” (Ge 9:26) This indicated God’s favor on Shem. In Abraham’s time the “seed” of promise was foretold to come through Abraham. (Ge 15:5; 22:15-18) Priest Melchizedek’s blessing on Abraham gave additional confirmation of this. (Ge 14:18-20) While God’s statement to Abraham revealed that Abraham would have offspring, it also disclosed that the ancestral line of the prophetically promised “seed” of deliverance would indeed run an earthly course.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Eve is the woman and  satan's seed is sin and evil.

It is all about it with pagan origins.<br>  <br>  The New Encyclop?dia Britannica, which says: “As at Christmas, so also at Easter, popular customs reflect many ancient pagan survivals—in this instance, connected with spring fertility rites, such as the symbols of the Easter egg and the Easter hare or rabbit.”<br>  <br>  Springtime was sacred to the sex worshipers of Phoenicia. Their fertility goddess, Astarte, or Ishtar (Aphrodite to the Greeks), had as her symbols the egg and the hare. She had an insatiable thirst for blood and immoral sex. Her statues variously depicted her as having rudely exaggerated sex organs or with an egg in her hand and a rabbit at her side. Sacred prostitution was part of her cult. In Canaan, the sex goddess was styled the wife of Baal. She was honored by drunken sex orgies, the worshipers believing that their sexual intercourse helped to bring about the full awakening and mating of Baal with his wife. According to the book Recent Discoveries in Bible Lands, “in no country has so relatively great a number of figurines of the naked goddess of fertility, some distinctly obscene, been found.”<br>  <br>  Beneath memorials to her in Carthage, brightly colored urns were discovered containing the charred bones of little children. Their parents, commonly people of rank and title, sought the blessing of the gods on their wealth and influence. Some of the urns were found to contain the remains of several children of different ages, perhaps of the same family.<br>  <br>  Even the name Easter is barely different from the ancient pagan name. Is this, then, the way to honor the holy Son of God?|`|ZcVkqwkcaa	I go out every day I can and walk around watching the woods and fields change from under their snowy blanket to green and warm.

Wn1rtE97aa	I support the tax-exempt status of churches and I'm not even religious.<br>  <br>  A tax-exempt status precludes the possibility of tax revenue from the church, which means there's no basis for influence from either side.  Politicians cannot curry favor by promising to cut tax rates, nor can they coerce a church by threatening to raise taxes, audit the church or otherwise manipulate the church.<br>  <br>  Conversely, large churches don't have the means to attempt to influence the state by controlling taxed offerings.<br>  <br>  What if the Pope told Catholics to put more into the offering plate for the government, or to withold offerings on account of some government policy?  Similarly, what if politiicians started shaking down churches and demanded increases in offerings to offset the budget crisis?  If a church refused, what if the government decided to shut down the church, or audit the church or its followers?  If churches were taxed, these sorts of things are conceivable.<br>  <br>  To my mind, the relationship between the church and the state is already messy enough without taxes being at issue.  Taxing churches would take a mess and turn it into a nightmare.|`|Api5zLaeaa	I'm actually against it. It is kind of like seeking help from the government to support your ministry. Isn't Holy Spirit supposed to do that? Christianity has to be very careful in this. Just to get the support, the Church has to elect members just to qualify. In doing they put on paper that they are structured in a specific way so they can become tax exempt. It is selling of the soul type of thing. I take heed in the fact that God says that he would even make the stones cry out the glories of God.|`|206820c72192d15525008e6de3c12f85aa	I'm all for it.<br>  The church is not a business.......<br>  <br>  I tithe faithfully to my church every week. <br>  The pastor needs to feed his family too so..............<br>  <br>  The church is a safe haven for us who love the Lord.<br>  If the outside world cries "church state separation" then why should we not be exempt?|`|CBKjEvp5aa	Against it.

If it was not for this so called "third sector" of society, the non-profits, government would be more burdened than they are caring for the needy.  <br>  <br>  Any non-profit organization can get tax exempt status, not just churches, and it would be unfair to single out a single group of non-profits and not tax the others.<br>  <br>  Yes, I've given a great deal over the years, and I've also helped churches in New York City with feeding and clothing the homeless.<br>  <br>  The Obama administration is cutting a lot of the tax deductions people get from giving to non-profits as part as his bid to raise taxes, but that hurts a segment of society if it reduces giving (not just to churches).|`|eDqGuGOeaa	Well the reason they don't pay taxes is because churches are non-profit organization and survive from donations. As long as they don't charge for services directly, they won't pay taxes. Another example of non-profit organizations are red cross organizations and some others.<br>  Scientologists claim themselves a religion but since they charge for a treatment to reach happiness and some other metaphysical problems, they are required to pay taxes.<br>  In conclusion, I believe Churches are a great business.

I feel that it is wrong to give this exemption to groups that hide behind the mask of a church in order to fill their pockets and buy up real estate and never give any community service or relief.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	For one thing, it means smaller churches can stay open. I pastored a very small church in upstate NY for years. If we had had to pay taxes, we could never have stayed open. As it was, the church never grew large enough to support itself. I always worked a full time job, and supplemented the churches expenses out of pocket.<br>  <br>  Our church teaches tithing. So I gave 10% of my income to the church (on top of the expenses I paid).<br>  <br>  Many churches would have to close if forced to pay taxes. Same with many other non-profit organizations.

He created us and gave us a perfect life. Adam messed up for all generations.  God does love us, he could have destroyed us all but he gave us salvation from our sin. He became fully human FOR US, and came down to live among men and DIE for us. He himself CAME to earth to make things right. God does destroy as you write BUT he does it when people continue to rebel time and time again. You aren't accounting for all the Good. What about the story of Lot and Sodom and Gomorrah? The whole city was wicked and Lot pleaded with God not to destroy the city if 1 man were found to be righteous. God could have just gone ahead and destroyed the earth if he pleased but he didn't, he saved Lot and his family.  Same as the flood story. The world was corrupt. He saved the only righteous family.  God is sovereign. and thankfully so. This means he is a just God.|`|4bc5b87ed73962c0f8d5a68384af5d86aa	If you read the context of that whole section from verse 58 on, you'll see that God is giving them a warning as if to say...If you choose to do as I say, "I will reward you, if not, I'll be equally glad to destroy you....your choice". It's a matter of righteous justice and judgment..not schizophrenia. Apparently, some people believe that a loving God means He should allow everything. True love does not encourage someone to sin by not punishing it. Chapter 28 deals with the blessings and rewards of obedience and the consequences of disobedience.<br>  <br>  I'm reminded of what Bill Cosby once jokingly said to his son..."I brought you into this world and I can take you out."|`|Lx5nEpT0aa	Deuteronomy, Chapter 28<br>  <br>   "THE BLESSINGS AND THE CURSINGS."<br>  "The Blessings, for Obedience [1-14]."<br>  The Cursings, for Disobedience [15-68]."<br>  <br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 28:63 "And it shall come to pass, that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the Lord will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it."<br>  <br>  It gives God great pleasure when He can do good to you for obeying His commandments. However just as it pleases God to build you up and protect you when you are in His will, so also it pleases Him to bring these curses on your and destroy you when you turn your back on Him. <br>  <br>  We know from the historical past that God did pluck the house of Israel from off their land in Palestine when they turned their back to Him, and went whoring after other gods. However, God did direct their paths in the migration to the new lands that He gave our forefather that did repent and sought after Him. When you love the Lord and seek after Him, God strengthen you and not one of His loved ones are plucked from His hands.
BFAbMbrIaa	Plus he doesn't say he loves you anywhere in the bible... matter of fact, if you look up Genesis 6:6 he Loathes us.. <br>  <br>  He's just like Zeus who hated mortals..<br>  <br>  If you look up the basic concepts of Gnosticism which is the more correct way to read those gnostic tales in the bible... they didn't even worship the Old Testament God, that's the Demiurge... the false imperfect creator god of the imperfect material realm... he mainly represents tyrannical authority... Christians got tricked into worshipping "Satan." lol|`|Rsww6L5qaa	Just as cold is the absence of heat and darkness is the absence of light, evil is the absence of God in men's hearts.  What is love unless one has the ability to choose not to love?  God did not create evil.  Evil comes from people perverting the things that God made or from using them in ways that God never intended.  <br>  <br>  With this in mind, lets look at the verses you just mentioned.  In all these verses, it is talking about God giving and taking away.  Whenever God removes himself from someplace, the end result will be evil.  Since God is Light, the land He left will be left in darkness.   When God does this, He is giving ourselves over to the choices of our own free will, giving us over to debased minds.  God loves us, but He is not a stalker.  If we want him to leave, He will.  This just shows us the root cause of evil-- godlessness.<br>  <br>  We can say the same thing about Love.  God is Love.  It is the defintion of who He is.  It is the essence of His character.  If God did not create love, we would all be indifferent.|`|cXXJVz64aa	People created gods, and the concepts of hell, heaven and evil.|`|4M2eNSb5aa	Ego along with greed, anger and lust are the root causes of evil.|`|gItLVFY2aa	Disobedience|`|RiyzkMO7aa	Ann Coulters wash-board like boobs.|`|rHHm4XNpaa	those verses didn't say he did it.|`|zHKIBAeQaa	It took a life span with no cell mate the long way back.

This creates an arrogance called "exclusivity" that pits one in-group against another in-group due to differences in established doctrines and dogmas. The result, as it ever was, is religious conflict. Murder and mayhem perpetrated in the name of an in-group's god is more than just a sad footnote in human history - it's a very large part of the dark side of the need to "believe in belief." In short, organized religion is poison.
8ubAwaGCaa	I actually don't like it very much.

So it is vital that we regularly turn to God for help, especially when are facing a persistent temptation. And if we worship Jehovah God according to his inspired Word, the Bible, he will deliver us by helping us to resist the Devil. <br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 10:13 says that "God is faithful, and will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, and that he will "also make the way out in order for you to be able to endure it."

sohnrZDcaa	I wonder how much of the Bible you read. Is it only John 3:16?<br>  <br>  Job 9:23 (NIV) When a scourge brings sudden death, God* (*NOT SATAN, but God!) mocks the despair of the INNOCENT. <br>  <br>  Job 9:17 (NIV) He* (*God… NOT SATAN, but God!) would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds FOR NO REASON. <br>  <br>  Job 9:24 (NIV) When a land falls into the hands of the wicked* (*like the USA falling into the hands of Obama?), he* (*God) blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it*? (*Certainly not SATAN!)<br>  <br>  Lamentations 3:37-38 (infallible King James Version) Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE MOST HIGH PROCEEDETH NOT EVIL AND GOOD*? (*Preachers lie, they say that “God is GOOD”, but not firstly EVIL… read it again FIRST EVIL and then “good” as a teaser!)  <br>  <br>  Exodus 4:11 (NIV) The Lord said to him, “Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the Lord? (This Bible God loves to brag about his endeavors! How barbaric can you get?)<br>  <br>  Amos 3:6 (infallible King James Version) Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be EVIL in a city, and the lord hath not done it?* (*ALL THE EVIL IN THE WORLD COMES FROM GOD… NOT FROM SATAN…!!! Praise the LORD!!!)<br>  <br>  Proverbs 16:4 (NIV)  The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, EVEN THE WICKED FOR THE DAY OF EVIL.<br>  <br>  No primitive religion in the world is as wicked as the Bible God religion. Christians made up in their mind about what Christianity ought to be all about in spite of the overwhelming primitive barbarism describing the Bible God! Christians need to be masochistically oriented to function in this world!<br>  <br>  Ruth 1:20-21 (NIV) “Don't call me Naomi,” she told them. “Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter. I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The Lord has afflicted me; the Almighty* (*NOT SATAN, but God Almighty! PRAISE THE LORD…! Sweet Jesus! Amen?) has brought misfortune upon me.”<br>  <br>  Proverbs 1:26-28 (NIV) I* (*God NOT SATAN, but God!)  in turn will laugh at your disaster; I WILL MOCK WHEN CALAMITY OVERTAKES YOU* (*Preachers are taking advantage of any calamity like a forthcoming California Earthquake to convey a “message” from the Bible God) - when calamity overtakes you like a storm* (*please read carefully… it doesn’t say “when I send calamity!” but when it happens the SOB Bible God takes advantage of it! God is also at the mercy of the weather conditions! You need to have a very low IQ and be very dishonest to qualify as a “minister of the Word of God”!), when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you. Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they* (*God’s people) will look for me but will not find me* (* yeah, what does God have to do with all that?).<br>  <br>  There goes the “I’m with you to the end” or is it only a teaser joke? This God is real only in the clever mind of the Bible writers… <br>  <br>  Jeremiah 11: 14 "Do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them, BECAUSE I* (*God) WILL NOT LISTEN WHEN THEY CALL TO ME IN THE TIME OF THEIR DISTRESS.<br>  <br>  Nothing scares primitive religious people more than the idea that their God doesn’t listen to them! It still works today! The Christian idea that this whimsical God always listens to them is wishful hoping that the chances are just right that God will answer on the spot, or later on, or never! It is just like praying to a stick or a rock or any other more benevolent Heathen God and getting the SAME IDENTICAL RESULT!<br>  <br>  Romans 9:11-15  Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad–in order that God's purpose in election might stand: not by works but by him who calls–she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” Just as it is written: “Jacob* (*Israel) I loved, but Esau* (*Arabs) I hated.”  What then shall we say? IS GOD UNJUST? NOT AT ALL!* (*Saint Paul says so… because he is telling you he speaks for God!)  For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”* (*the Christian clergy preaches you all the opposite that God is “no respecter of persons” when the Bible writers made it clear that he very picky just for the heck of it! BTW, one of the reasons why Christians do not favor Palestinians at all unless they convert to Christianity is in this Bible story that is taught in Sunday School session not over the public media!  If the Palestinians convert to Christianity there is no guessing of what will happen. Christians favor for Israel will be put on hold! Except for Christians in America most Christians elsewhere don’t give a hoot about politics!) <br>  <br>   Malachi 1:4  (NIV) Edom* (*Esau = Arabs) may say, "Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins."  But this is what the LORD Almighty says: "They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Wicked Land, A PEOPLE ALWAYS UNDER THE WRATH OF THE LORD* (*How would you like to be one of them? No FREE WILL FOR YOU! NO Salvation, either! God doesn’t like you for ever just for the heck of it! AND GOD NEVER CHANGES!)<br>  <br>  Isaiah 45:7 (infallible King James Version) I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and CREATE EVIL: I the LORD* (*NOT SATAN, but God) do all these things.<br>  <br>  Job 42:11 (infallible King James Version) Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over ALL THE EVIL that the LORD* (*NOT SATAN, BUT GOD!) had brought upon him:* (*God had a plan to have ALL of Job’s children slaughtered, too! The heck with family love and affection…!!! Isn’t God so wonderful?! Life is so cheap in the Bible and Christians are forcing this kinda God on everybody!)<br>  <br>  When was the last time that a Christian credited God for any of his/her misfortune? I bet they only blame Satan!|`|sAT8IU4vaa	yes they are true devil worshipers they take it to heart. they believe that path is the right path as we believe in another. they don't seek attention because people who like attention are stupid people and satanists hate stupidity...|`|hlnNZ9N4aa	i think they have a better sense of morality than you do.

I think they meant well but their desire for sensationalism (which is in of itself absolutely appropriate) went beyond the actual point. Or did it? Maybe not! Although they "declassified" themselves into the realm of Scientology with their money-grubbing -- it reached a desperate tempo once the 80's were over. Scientology survives because of, well hell we have heard the stories, but the LeVey church has no such clout. Overall: stars in satanism are not nearly as credible as stars in scientology. Isn't that funny? Satanist actually worship a true entity while scientologists are idiots placing their eternity in the hands of the bet a sci-fi writer made. <br>  <br>  Whatever. LeVey's stick to the whole doctrine of selfishness -- and  they snow their followers just as well as a fundie preacher with no real understanding or reality of true Christianity. Wonder if Satan is going to displeased? Hmmmmmmmm? Doubt it. For either group.<br>  <br>  As far as I am concerned the LeVey's are doing exactly everything they should for the master they serve -- at least they admit it. If you are stupid enough to give them money -- don't come crying to me. At least they ARE HONEST about it. It's satan's business and you don't get to complain. Wish the Westboro Church was as honest as the LeVeys.|`|lcMWoe8xaa	LaVeyan Satanists don't worship or believe in Satan, he is more of an icon.|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	Satanism is spiritual suicide, whether or not they are atheists.|`|ki8kdpJPaa	It's a philosophy not a religion.
WLdeJwbraa	I heard this story on the news last night, and sadly I wasn't so shocked!  The catholic church has done even worse things than this (let's not forget the inquisition).   It has nothing to do with God and what he wants, it has nothing to do with Jesus.  The church is worse than any mafia!  They're only there to manipulate, to frighten, and to control.  It makes me sick.<br>  <br>  I believe in God with all my heart, but these people have nothing to do with him.  And since you asked, it seems like they do have a lot of sympathy for child abusers!|`|QE2hNXeCaa	I read this story too and I didn't know what to do after wards, scream, cry, laugh, curse... it's surreal.<br>  <br>  Of course in paper they do not condone child abuse but their actions say something else. Like many people in the US it seems that as long as you're a fetus you have human rights but once you're out of the womb you have the right to remain silent and vow your head in acceptance. I don't know if this is it but one of the things that are wrong with most religions is that they rule over the bodies and the lives of women when their laws and authorities are created for and by men. The Pope cannot die in childbirth so why should he care? let a little girl loose her life because as long as you live on earth you may suffer and be a martyr. <br>  <br>  Screw that, if I was the mother of that little girl I would sell my soul to the devil if it meant I could help my child keep the little life she has left.|`|nMLomteraa	No, silly, do you? <br>  <br>  The offender is currently incarcerated, so, even if the Catholic church is not a regular Justice system , the general population of the world will see to it that Justice is served! Thank God!<br>  <br>  That is a terrible story!<br>  <br>  I'm Catholic. The loss of life is very sad. Was the child's life truly in danger? Maybe the church did not think so, that is why the Doctors involved were excommunicated? As far as I can tell, the Church are not Doctors, so they could not make such a decision as to whether or not the child's life was in danger. Personally, I would think that a nine year old should not give birth. But, if her body is having a "monthly" fertility time, then, maybe her body is really ready for babies? I honestly do not know. Is this a weird body anomaly due to all the wacky hormones injected into beef cattle and eaten by humans? from exposure to pesticides? endocrine disruptors? early puberty is a bad, bad, bad thing. Children look like adults. They start to have wacky adult feelings for the opposite sex, and still want to play with toys like children. They do not have the adult mentality to deal with the raging hormones.<br>  <br>  Of course, the girl is not at fault here, the incestious father is! TERRIBLE AWFUL MAN. Justice will be served. Thank God for the rest of humanity that has the morals and decency to lock him up away from the rest of the general population! Where would the church lock him up? they do not have the facilities. Silly YA posters. Justice will be served. anyway.|`|Yb0182Vxaa	they killed two babies, that's murder|`|yQNit56Qaa	1) Does the Catholic Church hierarchy condone child abuse?<br>  <br>  No - obviously.  Though there have been *individual* members who have shown this attitude - and have to answer to their superiors when they are caught out.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) The person responsible for the girl's abuse was not excommunicated because his crime was not as serious, as heinous, as the girl having a life-saving abortion.<br>  <br>  Now, look at this from the Roman Catholic point of view.  To them (and many other Christians as well), a fetus is just as much a person as you or I or, in this case, the mother.  Having an abortion, from this Christian perspective, is no different than paying someone to crush the skull of your own 5-year-old child with a golf club.  SO, the question from the pro-life point of view is:  Is molesting a child as vile as murdering two of your own children?<br>  <br>  <br>  3) This is the same group who have conspired for decades to protect priests who sexually abuse children by moving them from parish to parish.<br>  <br>  No, it is not.  Individual officials did *that*.  The abortion stance of the Roman Catholic Church is official church doctrine, not the sin of an individual in authority who (improperly) tries to cover up another's sin.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a>|`|niDOzrJraa	To the likes of Pepe:<br>  <br>  Even if it is conceded that abortion is akin to murder then why does the Catholic Church not excommunicate each and every Catholic murderer especially ones that have killed children?|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	No, they do not.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	They are a cult.|`|senICpbVaa	I don't think they intended to condone child abuse (but then again, you do hear all those stories about Catholic priests raping boys). Even if they didn't mean to condone child abuse, I seriously think they need to reconsider their views though. If the mother wouldn't have survived, then the two kids wouldn't have survived. Then you would have three deaths. And if the Catholic Church didn't think that the 9 year old mother was going to survive, then that's just moronic. There is no way that a 9 year old can support two kids, let alone even one. Who should we believe: medical practitioners who actually have medical degrees, or a hope by the church that everyone would survive?

Wn1rtE97aa	Nothing, from the perspective of Article VI of the Constitution.  The provisions there simply prohibit any sort of official religious test to hold public office (leaving aside informal de facto tests like demanding presidential candidates speak about their religious views on the campaign trail), and keeping the U.S. government out of the business of establishing a state-run church.<br>  <br>  However, I think it's useful not to tax churches because it is a crude but effective way to cut off the possibility of a financial interest being held between the two institutions.  The presence of a revenue stream between church and state opens up endless opportunities for corruption, and we already have too many as it is.  One can look at history to see that government and religion both operate as substantial bases of power in themselves, and the fewer ties between them, the fewer opportunities bad actors in either institution have to manipulate them both.|`|foHZo47yaa	I don't know what your previous question was, however, the reason churches don't have to pay taxes is because they are non-profit organizations supported by donations.

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Most of China uses simplified characters. Some legal documents (as far as I'm aware) are still written in traditional characters, but they'll use simplified characters for the newspaper and stuff. Taiwan and Hong Kong are the only places that really use traditional characters for everything. <br>  <br>  As for understanding both, I'm learning traditional characters right now, and some simplified characters are easy for me to understand, because it's obvious how it got simplified. For example, 課 ("class") simplifies to 课 and that's easy to then apply to every other Chinese character I see that has the 言 radical on the side, it just simplifies to 讠. But some simplifications are more complicated, like 廳 ("listen") simplifies to 厅, which I can sort of understand, but I don't automatically see what character that is. <br>  <br>  People who know simplified have a harder time understanding traditional characters, because at least by knowing 廳 I can see it's a 广 with some stuff under it, so when I see 厅 i can kind of make the connection. But if you only knew 厅 and saw 廳, you'd be like, "What's all that extra stuff!?" <br>  <br>  Also, traditional characters maintain all their original radicals, meaning the character 話 ("language") has the radicals 言 ("speech"), 千 ("thousand") and 口 ("mouth"), so when you see the character, you can figure out what it means even if you've never seen it before. By simplifying it to 话, you lose that 言 ("speech") radical, and therefore the main meaning of the word. But most people just memorize what the whole character means anyway, so it's normally not a problem. But you can see where simplified characters create a problem for people to understand traditional characters if they're not familiar with them.|`|99C4rNpGaa	Usually all the young folk use simplified chinese because, seriously it is much easier to use and faster too. But you can say I am old fashioned because I just can't seem to get the hang of using simplified, so I prefer to write in traditional, even though it takes me longer to write. I also like using traditional because of the history behind each chinese character. Each character is a pictograph created thousands of years ago, and I consider them art. The sad thing is that when you write in simplified form, the character loses it's meaning. But it's up to you whether you would prefer to use simplified for traditional. Usually if you know how to read traditional, you can somewhat read simplified.|`|wGXY1FTkaa	People in China use simplified characters. <br>  <br>  But in Taiwan they use traditionnal characters.

In this age of scientific enlightenment it is incredible to think some people are willing to maintain that something so vastly complex arose by chance. Like an egg or human eye, the universe is a masterpiece of precision that could not have come into existence by chance. <br>  <br>  The basic laws of science, including the laws of effects and their causes, like energy conservation and entropy undermine the evolutionary hypothesis.<br>  <br>  It is one thing to have faith in science fiction, but we must resist evolutionists who try to brainwash people into thinking evolution is science.|`|P5rczL0Saa	Really?

7ca5c6cf814ffe44b145b050ae60323aaa	That is an excellent question.  The best way to pray blessings for others and ourselves, even when you know exactly what they/we want, is in general terms.  All of time and history is unfolded before God.  He knows everything and can do anything.  He knows better what we need than we do.  He knows better what they need than they do.  Pray something like, "I pray blessings on my brother, Father, and that he would have the discernment necessary to see what it is and what it is to be used for."  You are leaving the blessing up to God and praying also that they will know it when they see it and know what to do with it to glorify God with it.  For us, personally, we are instructed to bring our petitions before the Lord.  So when you do know specifically what it is, it is best to pray that God's will be done and not our own, but here is what we desire.  Then study to make sure your desire is biblical and that it is not for your own selfish desire.|`|vvgodUChaa	if you are born again of the spirit you have been given everything you need for a life in godlyness,god is the inatiator of all things,even paryer if he lays something on your heart to pray for then do it christ give his life for you on the cross so he can come and live his life in and through you to day,we are to abide in the vine we are the branches we will bear much furit,love joy peace kindness,christ blood has removed the barrior of hositility we can go right into the throne room to abba father and make i request known to him,we live under a new covenant hebrews10:16-18|`|206820c72192d15525008e6de3c12f85aa	The only way a person can approach the throne of grace is through Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  A saved Christian is the only person who has this right..........<br>  All else falls on deaf ears.

The day seems ordinary enough. Cyclists maneuver through traffic, and orange poppies bloom on dry brown hills near Linde’s office on the Stanford University campus. But everything here, right down to the photons lighting the scene after an eight-minute jaunt from the sun, bears witness to an extraordinary fact about the universe: Its basic properties are uncannily suited for life. Tweak the laws of physics in just about any way and—in this universe, anyway—life as we know it would not exist.<br>  <br>  Consider just two possible changes. Atoms consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons. If those protons were just 0.2 percent more massive than they actually are, they would be unstable and would decay into simpler particles. Atoms wouldn’t exist; neither would we. If gravity were slightly more powerful, the consequences would be nearly as grave. A beefed-up gravitational force would compress stars more tightly, making them smaller, hotter, and denser. Rather than surviving for billions of years, stars would burn through their fuel in a few million years, sputtering out long before life had a chance to evolve. There are many such examples of the universe’s life-friendly properties—so many, in fact, that physicists can’t dismiss them all as mere accidents.<br>  <br>  “We have a lot of really, really strange coincidences, and all of these coincidences are such that they make life possible,” Linde says.|`|UyDkYaXuaa	I explored Paganism.

The Bible foretold that after the death of the apostles, wrong teachings and unchristian practices would slowly come into the Christian congregation. Men would draw away believers to follow them instead of Christ. (Matthew 7:15, 21-23; Acts 20:29,?30) That is why we see so many different religions that claim to be Christian. How can we identify true Christians?<br>  <br>  3. The most outstanding mark of true Christians is that they have real love among themselves. (John 13:34,?35) They are not taught to think that they are better than people of other races or skin color. Neither are they taught to hate people from other countries. (Acts 10:34,?35) So they do not share in wars. True Christians treat one another as brothers and sisters.—1?John 4:20,?21.<br>  <br>  4. Another mark of true religion is that its members have a deep respect for the Bible. They accept it as the Word of God and believe what it says. (John 17:17; 2?Timothy 3:16,?17) They treat God’s Word as being more important than human ideas or customs. (Matthew 15:1-3, 7-9) They try to live by the Bible in their everyday life. So they do not preach one thing and then practice another.—Titus 1:15,?16.<br>  <br>  5. The true religion must also honor God’s name. (Matthew 6:9) Jesus made God’s name, Jehovah, known to others. True Christians must do the same. (John 17:6,?26; Romans 10:13,?14) Who are the people in your community that tell others about God’s name?<br>  <br>  6. True Christians must preach about God’s Kingdom. Jesus did so. He always talked about the Kingdom. (Luke 8:1) He commanded his disciples to preach this same message in all the earth. (Matthew 24:14; 28:19,?20) True Christians believe that only God’s Kingdom will bring true peace and security to this earth.—Psalm 146:3-5.<br>  <br>  7. Jesus’ disciples must be no part of this wicked world. (John 17:16) They do not get involved in the world’s political affairs and social controversies. They avoid the harmful conduct, practices, and attitudes that are common in the world. (James 1:27; 4:4) Can you identify a religious group in your community that has these marks of true Christianity?|`|t7rSetD3aa	god is talking and if you listen he will tell you.<br>  and listen is not just with you hears.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	I converted to my faith when I was 14.

Abraham was brokenhearted.  Not only did he love his son, but it was through Isaac that all of Abraham's posterity was to be counted.  (Childlessness was considered a curse or a reproach in those days.)<br>  <br>  Abraham, in Paul's opinion at least, eventually decided that the Lord would raise Isaac from the dead.  He had reached the point where by his experience he knew that the Lord had been as good as his word that far (after all, Paul stated in Hebrews that Abraham had been as good as dead when it comes to fathering children).  But to have the Lord demand Isaac back?<br>  <br>  I'm assuming that Abraham had a witness from the Holy Ghost that he really was supposed to make the attempt, otherwise the episode would have been of no credit to him whatsoever.  (When you hear voices, a second opinion is always a good idea.)<br>  <br>  An important thing to remember is that Isaac might have been as much as twenty years old at the time.  I don't care how hale and hearty a possibly 120 year old man is, even in those days.  Unless he sneaked up behind Isaac with a rock, Isaac had to be a willing participant.  I always believed that Isaac was a passive wimp, dumber than dirt, but carefully reading the epistle to the Hebrews, chapter eleven, one can see that in a figure, Abraham really did receive Isaac back from the dead -- Isaac was born of the Spirit during his ordeal.  He sacrificed his own pride, was willing to give his life to the Lord, and he became a new man.<br>  <br>  Abraham needed to do some growing up.<br>  Isaac needed to do a lot more growing up.<br>  <br>  They both subordinated their own will to the Lord's will, and both were greatly blessed for it.  So now Abraham is called the father of the faithful, and three major religions revere his name to this day.|`|PGcJROA1aa	First of all, your story is about Abraham, whom God tested by asking him to kill Issac. The reason God did this was because He was planning to do something very special with Abraham. Because the Holy Spirit did not dwell in Abraham, God had to see how he would react to this test of his faith. By asking Abraham to sacrifice his son, the one God had promised him, God would see if Abraham loved God more than his son. He never had any intention of killing Issac. But God had a plan to give up His own Son to save mankind, and He had made a covenant with Abraham, promising to send the Messiah through one of Abraham's descendants. <br>  <br>        Because Abraham was true to the covenant, and obeyed God to the letter, God was obligated to carry out His part of the covenant, which was to send the Messiah, His Son, to redeem all of Israel and mankind. Though Isaac did not have to die, Jesus did. And God showed all of mankind that He indeed, could raise someone from the dead. Abraham believed God could do that for Isaac - because he knew that God had promised to give him many descendants.<br>  <br>        Sometimes God tests people to see if they are worthy of the great thing He plans to do in their lives. Abraham was called the father of many nations. He is the father of the Jewish faith, and because of his faith and trust in God's goodness, and even His ability to raise Issac back to life, God blessed Abraham and all mankind by sending a Saviour who would redeem all who had the faith of Abraham- the kind that trusts God no matter what. Faith is pleasing to God. It may seem hard to understand, but God is not being cruel- He is constantly looking for those who have faith. God understands that He is invisible to us- He understands that it can be difficult for men to believe in Him. But He is extremely pleased when He not only finds one who believes, but one who OBEYS. Such people are great in the eyes of God, and will be greatly rewarded someday.|`|O2RNsEOraa	Well Genius.<br>  Job was blessed with many things from God, then the Devil insisted that if God were to take away all of his luxuries Job would disbelieve.

It's only common sense to test someone when they say something to you. You want to show the world if this person is doing it just in front of you or if this person is serious.

Listen to her voice, because it is by means of Isaac that what will be called your seed will be.'"<br>  <br>  It was by means of a miracle that Isaac had even been conceived.  So, naturally, Abraham would have been confused when Jehovah asked him to offer up his son as a sacrifice.  Here is the account, as recorded in Genesis 22:6-12:<br>  <br>  "After that Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and put it upon Isaac his son and took in his hands the fire and the slaughtering knife, and both of them went on together. And Isaac began to say to Abraham his father: 'My father!' In turn he said: 'Here I am, my son!' So he continued: 'Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the sheep for the burnt offering?' To this Abraham said: 'God will provide himself the sheep for the burnt offering, my son.' And both of them walked on together.<br>  <br>  "Finally they reached the place that the [true] God had designated to him, and Abraham built an altar there and set the wood in order and bound Isaac his son hand and foot and put him upon the altar on top of the wood. Then Abraham put out his hand and took the slaughtering knife to kill his son.?But Jehovah’s angel began calling to him out of the heavens and saying: 'Abraham, Abraham!' to which he answered: 'Here I am!' And he went on to say: 'Do not put out your hand against the boy and do not do anything at all to him, for now I do know that you are God-fearing in that you have not withheld your son, your only one, from me.”<br>  <br>  Hebrews 11:17-19 says that Abraham "reckoned that God was able to raise him from the dead."  He had already witnessed first-hand his miraculous power, by being enabled to father Isaac in his old age.<br>  <br>  The role Abraham played in this situation helped us understand how difficult it must have been for Jehovah God to ‘give his only-begotten Son (Jesus Christ), in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.’ (John 3:16; Matthew 20:28)<br>  <br>  ------<br>  <br>  Job:  <br>  <br>  While it was not actually God putting Job to the test, He did allow Satan to put him to the test.  Job was considered a man "blameless and upright," and Satan challenged Jehovah God before all the angels that the only reason Job remained faithful was because he had blessed him so much.  After all, even Adam and Eve, being perfect humans, had turned away from God, so his challenge might seem reasonable.  He basically accused God of bribing Job to remain faithful to him.  So he let Satan take away all that Job had, except his very life.  Talk about suffering.  However, Job remained faithful, and in the end, he was blessed with more than he previously had.  In the future, he and all his family, both those that died before Satan's challenge was through and those that died afterward, will be resurrected to a paradise earth, where he will receive even more blessings.  <br>  <br>  For more on the hope the Bible holds out for the future, which both Abraham and Job entertained, you might enjoy this article entitled "An Inheritance You Can Count On" <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20041001/article_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20041001/art...</a><br>  <br>  Also, "Why Does God Permit Suffering?" <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/200611/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/200611/artic...</a>|`|9YMLsk7Taa	Listen genius, you mean Abraham.You have it so convoluted i wouldn't attempt an explanation!|`|AA11849917	Sorry, but you obviously haven't read the Bible!<br>  <br>  God never asked Job to kill his son!

His Church teaches the fullness of Christian truth until the end of time, just as He said it would. Protestants belong to an unauthorized tradition of conflicting manmade denominations that exist in open defiance of the stated will of Christ "that they all may be ONE".  Each denomination has rejected many of the beliefs and practices of original Christianity, and as such is really only semi-Christian.  Each denomination teaches a mix of genuine Christian truth received from the Catholic Church, and new traditions of men introduced by their many human founders.|`|iblT1HJpaa	It really depends on the weaponry they are equipped with. <br>  (sometime go to N.Ireland and you will "hear" the difference)|`|3df06b65831ca89dcc296c573d4605b4aa	This is a very complex question with many complex answers.

Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live forever." 59 These things he said while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.<br>  <br>  60 Then many of his disciples who were listening said, "This saying is hard; who can accept it?" 61 Since Jesus knew that his disciples were murmuring about this, he said to them, "Does this shock you? 62 What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63 It is the spirit that gives life, while the flesh is of no avail. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life. 64 But there are some of you who do not believe." Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe and the one who would betray him. 65 And he said, "For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father."<br>  <br>  66 As a result of this, many (of) his disciples returned to their former way of life and no longer accompanied him. 67 Jesus then said to the Twelve, "Do you also want to leave?" 68 Simon Peter answered him, "Master, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. 69 We have come to believe and are convinced that you are the Holy One of God." <br>  <br>  Jesus speaks to us in these passages, and He makes himself very clear. Jesus’ body is the bread and His blood is the wine. Moreover, to get to Heaven we must eat His body and drink His blood. While it is true that we do this in “remembrance” as He said at the Last Supper, make no mistake about it, there is no symbolism whatsoever in Jesus‘ Word here. To this day there is only one Church passed down form the apostles almost 2000 years ago where you can eat and drink the true presence of our Lord Jesus Christ. None of us can fully understand how the Eucharist works. We must simply have the faith that because Jesus himself taught this, it is Truth.<br>  <br>  Now is your chance to come home to Jesus’ one true Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. The reformists from the past whom started your churches may have had valid reasons for being upset with the Catholic Church, but they went about fixing it in the wrong way. We should not have divided. Your church either broke off directly from the Catholic Church or broke off of a denomination that broke off directly from the Catholic Church. We allowed Lucifer to divided us into thousands of pieces and take away form you the most important part of the Mass, The Most Holy Eucharist. Greatness will come out of a united Christianity under one Catholic Church once again.<br>  <br>  You now have a choice to make: either turn from Jesus and leave him like many of his earliest disciples did, or believe that Jesus would never lie to us as He is “the Holy One of God” and like the apostles, lead His flock home to Communion with all the angels and saints.

And now you know the signs from experience, you will be able to spot a man that is going to let you down much more easily.<br>  <br>  Try writing a list of the warning signs that, looking back, you can now see clearly in the men that disappointed you. For example, did they repeatedly say insensitive things to you, stand you up, take you for granted, have a history of cheating...?  In the future you're going to avoid men like that like the plague. <br>  <br>  Then make another list of the things your man is going to be: smart, funny, dependable, faithful, considerate, understanding, and yes, even the race you want, nothing wrong with be attracted to a certain one ....<br>  <br>  Now, think where would my ideal man be hanging out, and go there.

If you were truly a believer than you should have some as well.  You should also read the bible some, and maybe go to a church  You should also look at some of the alternate religions.  This may sound crazy coming from a christian, but I encourage you to learn as much about other religions as you can so that you can make an informed decision about what you believe.  Also it will allow you to have more tolerance for other people's beliefs, which is a quality not many (Christians included) posses.|`|ZZ1DYv0daa	Ask priests for help, pray, do anything and everything to bring back your belief, and if you still feel that you're faith isn't coming back, then it probably isn't.

Your faith.<br>  <br>  But God gives faith, the true faith and that cannot be truly lost.<br>  <br>  Unless you have been convicted of your sin against God and that you have absolutely nothing to offer God but deserve punishment for your sin, unless you have been brought to repentance, and to see your only salvation is in Jesus Christ, and unless you have been born anew by the Spirit of God and He has given a new heart to love God and His righteousness and Who also comes to indwell and enable you to live anew to God, then you did not have that faith that He alone gives.<br>  <br>  With the Spirit of God indwelling how can any lose their faith?<br>  <br>  It is all there in the Bible and many have experienced these things and live by the Spirit of God, though admittedly many more say they have but haven't.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  How does any obtain this faith?<br>  <br>  It is God's work and God works in many ways but there are always some common elements.<br>  <br>  There will always be conviction of sin against God and a seeking of Him however that might be caused. Since this true faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God the Bible will also be an essential element.<br>  <br>  <br>  You ask us but really you should be asking God.<br>  <br>  Seek Him then and if you have no motivation to, then seek Him for that too.

Obviously if you do not feel your sin against God you will not feel the need to seek Him for His salvation. <br>  Where to start? Without restricting you, the Gospel of John and the Epistle to the Romans are good places.<br>  <br>  When you seek God through the Bible you will find that things are very different to the popular notions that people have and that many so called Christians have, and you will be surprised.|`|7ca5c6cf814ffe44b145b050ae60323aaa	My friend I am going to say something that may be very hard for you.  Trust God and his word and get back to reading it.  The warnings of scripture teach us that if you bear no fruit, if you show no repentance, if you do not remain in Jesus you will be cut off from the vine and thrown into the fire.  You need to consider very carefully what you are saying about losing your faith.  John tells us that if you leave the body of believers you never belonged to it in the first place.<br>  <br>  Here's what you need to do.  Go to a good pastor who teaches the bible.  Tell him how you first "got saved" and tell him how your life changed.  If your life hasn't changed since before you made a decision to follow Jesus, if your life looks the same as before, then you weren't saved to begin with.  That's what the bible teaches.  There is fruit to show God has begun a work.  If God has begun a work in you, then fear not.  For he who started a good work in you will complete it unto the Christ Jesus.  Take refuge in that truth and promise and tell the Devil to flee from you with his lies.<br>  <br>  It absolutely does not sound ridiculous.  It is of utmost importance.  Remember the grace of God shown in Christ and cry out for salvation.  Cry out to be rescued.  Trust God and believe him.  Believe on Jesus and repent of any sin.  Then walk the way Jesus said to walk.  Do what Jesus said to do.  Find a good pastor who teaches the truth and grow in your relationship with God.

You know, it's really amazing that a lot of people say they are losing faith or have lost their faith after a major setback in their life. For example: depression, hospitalization, discovering they have cancer or other traumatic illness, loss of a loved one, or any other seemingly hopeless situation. Many people feel that God has let them down or has left them on their own to deal with their condition alone. However, people could not be more wrong about this. <br>  <br>  When things in life like this happen, it is the BEST time to turn to God and ask Him to help you. Pray sincerely and humbly to Him, asking Him for guidance and comfort during this difficult time in your life. You don't need to say a formal prayer. Find a quiet place in your room (keep the door closed) and just talk to Him as you would your very best friend, like in secret. Tell God all your concerns and your fears. Tell Him that you don't know how to deal with it all. When God sees that you are praying to Him in secret, to He who is unseen, He will reward you. Yes, He will. It may not be this minute or this hour. But God will help you. He promised He would and He has never broken a promise yet. Remember, give God your heart while you talk to Him. He knows your love for Him. And He will wait for you to give it to Him. That's how understanding He is. Just please don't give up for good. Reach out for Him - he will lift you.|`|DiIAaFgzaa	Read the bible.  Go to church and listen to the sermons and lessons.  Pray.

God wants to speak to you and this is how he does it.|`|oVHFz52Laa	I recommend the book " The Purpose Driven Life" by Rick Warren. Also Ravi Zacharias has many great books. Study the Bible and surround yourself with strong Christians. Pray about it. Find a church home where you like to worship God|`|cLATPkjkaa	Why do you want it back?<br>  Close your eyes and mutter to the air, I hear it helps.
CEQpDpnPaa	only angels have angel wings. angels are from heaven and servants of the Lord. how is that goth?|`|4nqAS3sbaa	they would only be "goth" if you intend them to be, ya know? If your parents know you (and you are not goth), then they wont worry. They can mean whatever you want them to mean to you. :)|`|y9rP2tWHaa	no its just a rocker color and please i bet your parents own a black shirt they are just being over rediculous!|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	My guess is that they are somehow supposed to represent a fallen angel.|`|wK85ZvOMaa	No. They are fine.

7f19096dfc203109750db707ef0faeedaa	To say that Chinese literature is boring indicates that you know absolutely nothing about it, or you are very, very stupid. Probably both. Chinese literature includes over 3,000 years of unparalleled poetry, prose, historiography, philosophy, etc. No other civilization's literature comes close to rivaling Chinese literature in terms of breadth, depth, beauty, subtlety, profundity. <br>  Ignorance s not amusing.
UxooffHZaa	Everyone is psychic. Most people don't develop their gifts. Start with Meditation. Practice some form of divination daily. (i.e. Tarot, or Runes) This daily practice of meditation and divination (and keep a journal of these practices, with little notes on results, times, days etc) will develop these skills.|`|hTlzSCYlaa	u r the 1 2 develop the gift (:|`|BQAP3LM5aa	I'm a paranormal advisor and a developed psychic.Psychics, like myself, usually can predict things that aren't as obvious as the examples you gave. My example:   last week I saw my cousin up on stage at a school play. I had no idea he was in a play when I saw the "vision" and last night I was "suprised" when he asked me to go. While at the theater tonight, I saw the exact same "scene" I saw in my vision. That is what many, not all, psychics go through when it comes to their visions|`|WJGsHFRAaa	That acually sounds like what my friend can do. I believe that I'm an animal psychic also. Just go with what you "feel" and don't be surprised if it happens. You might even be able to stop extermly bad things caused by a stupid mistake. like I said if you are just go with it. if you turn out to be psychic then thats great. it's not a bad thing|`|vUSLyZzZaa	its a prophetic gift, i hav it 2.  Grow spiritually in God, and the gift will grow with it.|`|SOvItNDHaa	There, I moved you to level 2 psycic with my mind powers. You must fulfill your destiny soon though. Wait for my signal.|`|Y5XuT9oSaa	It's called intuition or, in normal human terms, a gut feeling.  Ending of movies are sometimes pretty obvious especially if you have seen a lot of movies, because most movies are similar in structure.  Obviously your dog would die sometime.  I'd say the last one was just a lucky guess.  I don't want to ruin your hope but i doubt you're psychic.  However, you can seem like one to people who don't pay much attention.  It is true that history repeats itself.  Look for little clues that happen before something happens.  When you see them again, make your "psychic prediction" and hopefully it will happen.
NWa45ZDIaa	Neither. <br>  I don't want to go to heaven because that is not where I have a hope to live. I too would think its boring, especially if it's floating around on clouds playing harps with baby angels as false religion depicts heaven to be. I don't want to go to Hell, especially the common false belief that it is a fiery place of torment for sinful people. If those false religious beliefs were correct, then every human on the face of the earth would "go to hell" since we're all sinful. & just because someone is "Atheist or Agnostic" doesn't mean they're evil.<br>  <br>  Nope, no thanks for either of those places.<br>  <br>  However, I'm definitely a Christian, I believe wholeheartedly in God, in Jesus, the Bible & all of the prophesies in it about hope for the future. Which has nothing to do with mainstream Christianities belief in heaven & hell. I believe that the earth will soon be a paradise, where we will live forever on it without sickness, crime, war, hatred, pollution, wickedness, pain & even death will be gone. Want to see some scriptures about this?<br>  <br>  Here's just a couple:<br>  Psalm 37:9-11, 29 "For evildoers themselves will be cut off, But those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth. And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; And you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, And they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace. The righteous themselves will possess the earth, And they will reside forever upon it."<br>  Acts 24:15 "...there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. "<br>  Isaiah 33:24 "And no resident will say: “I am sick.” The people that are dwelling in the land will be those pardoned for their error."<br>  Isaiah 25:8 "He will actually swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces. And the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for Jehovah himself has spoken it."<br>  Revelation 21:4 "And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away."<br>  <br>  If you ask me that sounds like a much better option then heaven or hell. & It definitely doesn't sound boring either. You can contact me if you'd like (add yourself to my contacts & email me). <br>  <br>  Take care!|`|oVHFz52Laa	Heaven. Gnashing fo the teeth does nt sound too good to me.|`|TVLlkYUiaa	I really don't think all those people are going to be in Hell. Get a life ok? Do some research before you ask a stupid question.
4dSSslHEaa	Haha thats gr8<br>  <br>  Marilyn Manson in hell, hilarious!!! All my fav people will be there as well so....................<br>  <br>  I guess i'll join you 4 the party|`|ZcV4zmpxaa	I don't believe in either since I'll be reincarnated into some living creature. PLZ not make me into a cow!!!!!!! I would be sad -_-|`|AA11502346	Heaven.|`|TfgscKiYaa	I would rather go to Ireland.|`|CEQpDpnPaa	hmm... paradise or a lake of fire..... Paradise!|`|ZZ1DYv0daa	I read somewhere : "Go to heaven for the environment, and hell for the company" ^^<br>  <br>  ~"I don't like to commit myself about heaven and hell - you see, I have friends in both places" - Mark Twain|`|e1da218fa360d619acec56b3218b6e6caa	Heaven.  I will have eternal life with God and Jesus.  Hell is a place of torture.  Loneliness.  No one around you.  You will not be with or see anyone in hell.  You will be tortured for all eternity.|`|BSlVGJ62aa	Heaven!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... Thanks god.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	Personally, I think I'll just stay home.
PtIyg9Qqaa	God made man in his own image, with a free will, the ability to love, think, ask questions (even if they're silly).<br>  <br>  Man decided that he would rather do things his own way instead of God's way.  This is called pride and is the basis of all sin.  If God made the world free of sin, would he then be omnipotent, or just dictatorial?  If you cannot sin, you are just an automaton.  But since we sin, we defile God's holy image within us and are worthy of dying.  He sent his son to redeem us (buy us back) from the result of sin, which is death.<br>  <br>  There are things that God cannot do.  Does that mean he's not omnipotent?<br>  He cannot learn.  Since he made it, he knows how it works.<br>  He cannot lie.  It's against his nature.<br>  He cannot make you love him, since he did give you freedom of choice.|`|zKOZ8Gafaa	The "original sin" broke the covenant with God.  To save all of mankind, God sent Jesus.  All our sins were nailed on the cross with Jesus.<br>  <br>  Because only God and Jesus are perfect, we will never be sin free.  God knows this.  But He asks us to do good and to spread the Word.<br>  <br>  A human cannot see God, He is too magnificent and immense.  You cant look at the sun, and you can't see God.|`|MEbdRp18aa	see just because your from GOD that doensnt mean you dont require food.you need three times food to stay alive in this world.<br>  with food you eating then only GOD can help you.<br>  if not even you are from GOD if you dont get/eat food you cant be saved by GOD.<br>  SO ALL LIVING BEINGS NEED FOOD THIS THE RULE OF THE EARTH.<br>  SO IT IS LIKE THAT YOU NEED THESE PEOPLE TO SERVE YOU FOOD TO KEEP GOD KINGDOM /FAMILY ALIVE FOR EVER ON THE EARTH.<br>  IF NOT DEVILS WILL EAT /KILL YOU AND OTHER GOD PEOPLE/FAMILYS IN EARTH FOR EVER STEALING YOUR MATERIALS/GOODS AND BODY AND LIFE FROM YOU.<br>   SO THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS WORLD FOR ALL.|`|4ad0fb30a1174358bcdd57576983960caa	Omnipresent doesnot need a son or prophet or incarnation.<br>  <br>  However enlightened souls help people rise to their level. Its all a play of that omnipresent within itself and its just a game.  One who plays it lightly rises, one who plays it too engrossed in it get trapped. Its simple.|`|SLL4sNnnaa	I understand that you are unable to accept GOD to be Omnipotent, because he needs the help of a Prophet or a Son or his own incarnations, to clear the evil from the World.<br>  <br>  The entire living beings on earth, are all born on the basis of Poorva Karma or the Quality of their previous birth.<br>  If God the all powerful removes all the sins of these livingbeings, the importance of rightiousness shall be lost.<br>  God is not a Minister in Government to announce the waiver of all Sins committed by all livingbeings. He is the restorer of Dharma or Rightiousness. If God would remove all the sins of us, without a punishment, we shall tend to commit more Sins, as we know that there will be no punishment.<br>  <br>  The Philosophies that refine us are not so easy for all of us to understand. Therefore we need Prophets or Incarnations, who appear in the form of Gurus to help us understand the divine path to attain 'MOKSHA' .<br>  <br>  If attainig MOKSHA is so simple that GOD shall remove all SINS and provide you the ultimate goal of getting MOKSHA, the charm of the life shall be lost.<br>  <br>  To provide us all an oppertunity to refine ourself with our own efforts, God has given us this birth. Let us concentrate on things which would refine us rather than those which would corrupt our mind.|`|3cxJfevQaa	The world might be exactly the way its supposed to be.|`|UCrcbyCPaa	In the Name of Allah the most Gracious the most Merciful.<br>  <br>  Brother,Almighty God is the creator,the omnipotent,the all aware,the allknowing ,the all WISE.He is able to do all things.<br>  All major religions point to one fact that there is only one God.He is the self sufficient master.He does not have sons and daughters and he does not need them.He created us ONLY to worship him.Every moment of our lives that we live in accordance to his commands is an act of worship.He gave man intellect and a freedom of choice to choose between right and wrong,If God almighty had to creat us all equal,all intelligent,all pious,all like zombies,where would be the test??<br>  where would be the trials,where would be the competition?We would be given our degrees at birth,what would be the use of education?our entire life would be chalked out like zombies without any purpose or aim.But God is the all wise,he gave us the power to Think to choose to make decisions,he gave us the joy of living.Do you not feel joy when you do yor best or work hard on a project and get rewarded for it???<br>  In the same way this world is a test for us a trail for us,how we live our lives will determine finally what is going to be our reward eaternal bliss in paradise or the torment of hell fire.<br>  God almighty is all powerful,if he left us to our whims and fantacies we would definitely all be lost in the hell fire. We are ungrateful to God,He gave us life and all that goes with it,When we are in trouble we cry to God,but when he removes our troubles we thank others, we worship others,we worship statues,Animals,men and what not/<br>  In order to guide us to the truth God almighty sent us Prophets and messengers during every age with his guidance and commandments.to warn us that we should worship him alone,that we should follow his commandments,to give glad tidings to his followers of the bliss of paradise and to warn the evil doers of the torment of the hell fire.<br>  Unfortunately we have begun to follow the footsteps of satan,who made us believe that there are many God ,who made us believe that God has son,,daughters,wives,who made us worship statues.Animals,the sun ,moon stars and satan himself ! In this way we have become ungrateful to God Almighty and we have bought sin,pain and suffering upon ourselves.In God's hand is only the good,Whatever evil befalls us is only due to our actions.|`|AA11826961	History has the answer to your question. Buddha, Mahavir Jain, Christ, Ibrahim, Mohammed or Nanak had taken birth after 6th century B.C. These great men were, undoubtedly, human beings. We know of no prophets prior to that period when the world was free from sins.<br>  Bhagvadgeeta says the creation undergoes four yugas--Satya, Tretha, Dwapar and Kali . The first two are divine and vice-less. We are at the *** end of Kali when the world is full of deception, cruelty and sin.<br>  According to Scriptures: Yadayadahi dharmasya glanir bhavathi bharath, abhuthanam adharmasya tadasmanam srujamyaham (God takes birth in Bharat or India when people go astray and are doomed in terms of dharma).<br>  God is Nir-akara, according to Shankaracharya. He is abstract and has no physical form as per Aristotle.<br>  Hindu philosophy says He does not come under the cycle of rebirth or death. He wants the human race to purify itself before they get back to Heaven. Unless we free ourselves from sins such as lust, anger, greed, attachment and ego we'll be in this vicious cycle of death and birth and cannot go back to our Heavenly home, which can accommodate ONLY PURE SOULS.<br>  The Kalachakra (cycle of time) of world drama is being enacted and directed by God Himself who CAN cleanse the world of its SINS at the end of Kali Yuga.<br>  Are we not heading for destruction? Our waters are not safe to drink, our air polluted and foods are getting poisoned. Will the global warming and nuclear wars save the humanity from destruction? The Ominipotent God is certainly reconstructing a world after destroying this old world, thanks for our collective sins.|`|i32hmWuZaa	according to christianity and islam the ancestors of everyone in this world had incest sex...If everyone came from Adam and Eve then it means Adam and Eve had sex with their own sons and daughters... and the younger generation followed this trait..so the brother and sisters had sex with each other... So infact according to this theory God created man to do incest sex and grow his community...So if you are a true christian or muslim..you have to believe that someone in your family was a bastard...<br>  <br>  So stop believing in this stupid theory..all these stories were created by men/women for thier own interests...|`|Rsww6L5qaa	God does not rid the world of sin because He gave us free will.  This comes with the ability to choose evil.  God could change the world at any moment, but God is still giving us time to repent.  God sent prophets to be His messengers.  God coming down from Heaven all the time giving us warnings wouldn't be a good idea.  We would be blinded all the time.  God also cannot look upon sin for He is Holy.  God also wants to know who truly loves Him.  He doesn't want us to come to Him out of fear, but instead through faith.<br>  <br>  Jesus came to Earth to save and redeem mankind.  That was His mission.  Jesus had to come and satisfy God's law.  The wages of sin is death.  God could not just forgive sin, yet He could not just forsake a sinner.  The only way Jesus could satisfy His law was through death-- a shedding of blood to cover our sins.  God who is infinite took our infinite punishment.  God also lived among us so that He could live like a man, going through all of the trials and tribulations that we go through, yet without sin.  He also came to teach us so that we could how to come to God.<br>  <br>  You suggest that God isn't all-powerful, but I think that the things I just mentioned are powerful in themselves.  The greatest miracle of all is how He could love me so much.  Some of the things God did used to make no sense to me, but now that I am older I realize that all along the things He did were perfect.

ilz08Y3taa	The verb is actually "haber" and it means:<br>  <br>  hay - there is/are<br>  hubo - there was/were<br>  habia - there was/were<br>  <br>  And "vosotros" is not at all a synonym for "nosotros" but many people make that mistake.  It is used mainly in Spain.  It means "you" but plural like in America we would say "you guys" or "you all".<br>  <br>  And in Argentina and parts of Chile they use the "vos" form.  This is just a substitute for the "tu" form.  For vos verbs are conjugated differently:<br>  <br>  Yo - soy<br>  vos - sos<br>  el/ella/ud. - es<br>  nosotros - somos<br>  vosotros - sois<br>  ellos/ellas/uds. - son<br>  <br>  For most verbs in the "vos" form, you would just add as (for ar verbs) or es (for er/ir verbs).<br>  <br>  Ex.<br>  <br>  Tener<br>  Vos tenes<br>  <br>  Hablar<br>  Vos hablas<br>  <br>  Querer<br>  Vos queres<br>  <br>  Seguir<br>  Vos segues|`|wGXY1FTkaa	<a href="http://espagnol.spanish.free.fr/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://espagnol.spanish.free.fr/index.ph...</a>|`|3SdR0e0zaa	Well first of all "vosotros" is a synonym for "nosotros" or us. It is practically only used in Spain as a traditional way to adress people. <br>  <br>  Hay= is<br>  Hubo= was<br>  <br>  Therefore "Hay" is used when you are talking in present tense and "hubo" when you are talking in past tense.<br>  <br>  Many people throughout Latin America use different verbs to denominate a person. "sos" does not have a plural form <br>  <br>  Sos does not = Vos<br>  vos= you<br>  sos= you are<br>  <br>  the plural form of "yo"= I is "us"="nosotros"<br>  <br>  Advice: do not try to learn all ways of saying I or you, just stick to one because in spanish one word can always be expressed like in five different ways, that is why they call it one of the richest languages in the world.

Is a one year old still a baby?  It's much different than when it was first born.

This is hollow reasoning. No one doubts that a newborn baby—only minutes old—is a human being. Yet, if that child were put naked into an outdoor field, how long would the child survive? It is utterly helpless and, like the embryo or a fetus, lacks the capacity to sustain itself.

At 12 weeks the fetus is NOT a baby!|`|mOaG5ueZaa	Actually, your assumption is in conflict with what the majority of doctors and scientists believe. Most doctors and scientists admit the fetus is a baby, what is really at the heart of the issue is whether or not the preborn child should be assigned personhood.<br>  <br>  First of all, your question involves a misnomer. For the first three months of pregnancy, the child is an embryo, so if your argument rests on what happens before the 12 weeks, then your argument has failed already. You should admit the fetus is a baby, but not an embryo, which takes place before week 12. However, the evidence is conclusive that we are alive from the earliest point of conception.<br>  <br>  But your arguments are all weak. A fetus is a baby because 1) he/she has human DNA. A human cannot simply be "there." A human is either alive or dead. And 2) by week 12, the child has developed a heartbeat and brain waves, and if you stop either of those, death has occurred. So that disproves your argument, as a fetus is a baby.<br>  <br>  However, even before the child becomes a fetus, he/she exhibits all the necessary qualifications for life including (but not limited to) cell division, response to stimuli, respiration (even though the child doesn't breathe as we do, respiration still occurs), etc. There is no reason to consider a preborn child in any stage of development as "non-human".<br>  <br>  There are only four differences between a preborn child and a born child, which are: size, level of development, environment, and degree of dependency. Size is not a qualification for life, otherwise taller people should be deserving of more rights than shorter people. Level of development is not a qualification for life, otherwise handicapped people would be less deserving of rights than those who aren't. Environment is not a qualification for life. After all, the child merely resides in the uterus because at that stage of development, it is necessary to keep the child alive. The child has a unique set of DNA from the mother's, meaning that the child is not a mere "appendage" of the mother's. Besides which, just residing inside something doesn't make you a part of it, anymore than I'm a part of this room that I'm answering this question in. Lastly, degree of dependency is no qualification for life. After all, an infant can no more take care of him/herself than a preborn child can, yet I don't know anyone who believes toddlers aren't alive.<br>  <br>  Finally, as for your arguments, whether or not the child feels anything is irrelevant. Otherwise, people in comas would cease to be humans, and we would cease to be humans everytime we fall asleep. Also, even though the child doesn't breathe as we do, respiration still takes place. But breathing is, again, not a qualification for life, otherwise humans would cease to be humans when they submerge underwater, having to take breathing apparatus' with them, or simply holding their breath.<br>  <br>  There is no logical or scientific reason to consider a preborn child to be anything less than human, and there is absolutely no reason not to give the child personhood, as he/she does indeed belong to the human race.|`|VLxU5112aa	A fetus can also not survive on its own.

Its advocates reason that God’s divinity and perfection require that he be omniscient (all-knowing), not only respecting the past and present, but also regarding the future. For him not to foreknow all matters in their every detail would evidence imperfection, according to this concept.<br>  <br>  But consider the implications of such a predestinarian view. This concept would mean that, prior to creating angels or earthling man, God exercised his powers of foreknowledge and foresaw and foreknew all that would result from such creation, including the rebellion of one of his spirit sons, the subsequent rebellion of the first human pair in Eden (Gen. 3:1-6; John 8:44), and all the bad consequences of such rebellion down to and beyond this present day. This would necessarily mean that all the wickedness that history has recorded (the crime and immorality, oppression and resultant suffering, lying and, hypocrisy, false worship and idolatry) once existed, before creation’s beginning, only in the mind of God, in the form of his foreknowledge of the future.<br>  <br>  If the Creator of mankind had indeed exercised his power to foreknow all that history has seen since man’s creation, then the full force of all the wickedness thereafter resulting was deliberately set in motion by God when he spoke the words: “Let us make man.” (Gen. 1:26) These facts bring into question the reasonableness and consistency of the predestinarian concept; particularly so since the disciple James shows that disorder and other vile things do not originate from God’s heavenly presence but are “earthly, animal, demonic” in source.—Jas. 3:14-18.<br>  <br>  The argument that God’s not foreknowing all future events and circumstances in full detail would evidence imperfection on his part is, in reality, an arbitrary view of perfection. Ultimately, God’s own will and good pleasure are the deciding factors as to whether anything is perfect, not human opinions or concepts.—2?Sam. 22:31; Isa. 46:10.<br>  <br>  To illustrate this, God’s almightiness is undeniably perfect and is infinite in capacity. (1?Chron. 29:11, 12; Job 36:22; 37:23) Yet his perfection in strength does not require him to use his power to the full extent of his omnipotence in any or in all cases. Clearly he has not done so, or, not merely would certain ancient cities and some nations have been destroyed, but the earth and all in it would have been obliterated long ago by God’s executions of judgment, as at the Flood and on other occasions. (Gen. 6:5-8; 19:23-25, 29) God’s exercise of his might is therefore not simply an unleashing of limitless power but is constantly governed by his purpose and tempered by his mercy, where merited.—Neh. 9:31; Ps. 78:38, 39.<br>  <br>  Similarly, if, in certain respects, God chooses to exercise his infinite ability of foreknowledge in a selective way and to the degree that pleases him, then assuredly no human or angel can rightly say: “What are you doing?” (Job 9:12; Isa. 45:9; Dan. 4:35) It is therefore not a question of ability, what God can foresee, foreknow and foreordain, for “with God all things are possible.” (Matt. 19:26) The question is what God sees fit to foresee, foreknow and foreordain, for “everything that he delighted to do he has done.”—Ps. 115:3.|`|pfdIK6Opaa	Apparently so, if He is as all knowing as religions claim.|`|45Mmu3SFaa	Satan was an angel of God and did wrong that's when he became a fallen Angel...|`|akoqXxZPaa	if hes omnipotent and omniscient|`|4fffa6bae2775acc0a4469d4a0d63b20aa	No.  Deuteronomy 32:4,5 gives the answer:  <br>  <br>  "The Rock, perfect is his activity,<br>  For all his ways are justice.<br>  A God of faithfulness, with whom there is no injustice;<br>  Righteous and upright is he.<br>  <br>  "They have acted ruinously on their own part;<br>  They are not his children, the defect is their own.<br>  A generation crooked and twisted!"<br>  <br>  Even though Jehovah God has the ability to foresee the future, he chooses when he does so.

AA10214265	Its an archaic policy holdover from the early days of AIDS infections in the 1980s. The Center for Disease Control determined that something was transmitted by blood, probably through sex, and urged the blood banks to test their supplies and donors using a hepatitus test that had shown about an 80% accuracy rate in screening whatever the cause was. The blood banks balked at the expense and refused to screen, instead instituting a policy against homosexuals and Haitians, two populations that showed the greatest number of AIDS infections. Unfortunately for some hemophiliacs, that prohibition wasn't enough and blood plasma in the blood banks was found to contain HIV, infecting many hemophiliacs. Eventually, the prohibition against Haitians was dropped, but the prohibition against gays remained.<br>  <br>  Why? Its an artificial screen and makes no sense. People can lie about their sexual history. And since we now know the gestatation period for HIV is 3-6 months, any gay man who did have sex with a man (with or without protection) and tested HIV negative 6 months later is likely to be clean. Additionally, HIV-specific testing is available and much more rapid than it was just a few years ago.<br>  <br>  Blood banks do now screen their product for HIV and other diseases. But the ridiculous artificial screen against gay men remains in place, despite the desperate need for blood donors. Yes, it does upset me. At my office the Blood Bank makes quarterly visits and pleads for donors, often offering a raffle ticket to entice donors. I made the point to my company that such an offer violated their non-discrimination policies, since gay men were excluded from entering to win the prize by virtue of the blood bank's prohibition on gay men donors. The Blood Bank continues to make its visits, but the offer of prizes is now discreetly mentioned to each specific donor as opposed to a company-wide blast email.|`|0c63fdd0630be2f6cbd717d497ab2474aa	Men who have sex with men are at a greater risk of HIV because HIV is spread extremely easily through anal sex, much more easily than through vaginal sex.

The current (265th) pope is Pope Benedict XVI, who was elected April 19, 2005 in papal conclave.<br>  <br>  The office of the pope is called the Papacy; his ecclesiastical jurisdiction is called the "Holy See" (Sancta Sedes in Latin) or "Apostolic See" (the latter on the basis that both St. Peter and St. Paul were martyred at Rome). In addition to his spiritual role, the pope is Head of State of the independent sovereign state of the Vatican City, a city-state entirely enclaved by the city of Rome.<br>  <br>  Early popes helped spread Christianity and resolve doctrinal disputes. At first, the pope's secular ally was the Roman Emperor. In the 8th century, however, Pope Stephen II was forced to appeal to the Franks for help, beginning a period of close interaction with the rulers of the West. For centuries, the forged Donation of Constantine also provided the basis for the papacy's claim of political supremacy over the entire former Western Roman Empire. In medieval times, popes played powerful roles in Western Europe, often struggling with monarchs for power over wide-ranging affairs of church and state, crowning emperors (Charlemagne was the first emperor crowned by a pope) and regulating disputes among secular rulers.<br>  <br>  Gradually forced to give up secular power, popes have come to focus again almost exclusively on spiritual matters. Over the centuries, popes' claims of spiritual authority have been ever more clearly expressed since the first centuries, culminating in the proclamation of the dogma of papal infallibility for those rare occasions the pope speaks ex cathedra (literally "from the chair (of Peter)") when issuing a solemn definition of faith or morals.

AA10007956	Hi Minnah,<br>  <br>  I am a Christian and I too believe a woman should cover decently, and if you are doing this for God and faith and you chose it, not that your parents or your Imam just told you to do it and you did - then I think it is perfectly within your right to wear a hijab proudly.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, it is what you believe in and not what others think about you. This is your relationship with God and you believe in all honest to goodness that God has commanded you and womenkind to wear the hjiab, well, what is stopping you from wearing one and spreading the word to encourage women to wear it?<br>  <br>  However, with niqab I am a little conflicted, because I did remember reading that your Prophet commanded his wives to cover their faces and hide behind curtains because outsiders were coming in and out and he did not like it.<br>  However, with Asma, he said, "When a woman has reached puberty she should only show here and here", pointing to hands and face.<br>  <br>  Hence I feel niqab is not compulsory but if a woman so wishes she can wear it, but it is not compulsory. <br>  Another supporting statement is that when a Muslim prays to God she must uncover her face to God. Why must she cover to man, and not to God?<br>  Man is not greater than God!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Jenova|`|QE2hNXeCaa	None of my Muslim friends wear Hijab but some of their moms and older relatives do. For me Hijab is an absolutely non-issue, in fact, it can complement te features of some women. Burkas, nikab and abayas don't necessarily bother me but I must say they cause a lot of curiosity and sometimes I stare a little bit when I see women wearing it. Since I have no religion or faith it makes me curious and I wonder what moves people to live such a radical life (from my perspective of course). Also, it is incredibly hot where I live and it must be very tough to wear heavy black clothing when you're juggling around in the bus with two or three children, school books or the groceries. When I see little girls wearing them in all honesty it does rub me the wrong way. I think childhood should be a genderless time.Just my opinion.|`|ryIMTXrRaa	As long as it is the woman's choice, and not something she was pressured/bullied into by someone else, I don't see anything wrong with it.|`|2PGvedOcaa	Well, you asked.... yes!  I think it represents a hate for women.|`|5UyO2OBzaa	I like it. at least it gives women less chance to become Lesbian or bisexual.|`|26Qb0cUjaa	Hijab can be kinda cute, just make it a decorative one rather than a OH MAN I HAVE TO HIDE THE INADEQUECIES OF MY GENDER BECAUSE ALLAH IS SEXIST one<br>  <br>  Niqab way too much<br>  <br>  Abaya can look nice, but again go for a decorative variation<br>  <br>  If you want to avoid alienating people, i'd stick to a symbolic hijab rather than a functional one, and forego the rest|`|E7fguoVBaa	I think it is.
CCAQWT25aa	Hello.<br>  "Field hockey" translates into Spanish as "hockey sobre césped". This is the sport, NOT the place where it is played.<br>  <br>  Field hockey is played on a hockey field. And "hockey field" translates as "campo de hockey" or "cancha de hockey".<br>  <br>  The words used are the same for the sport and the place where it's played, but it's the order of those words that changes in order to give the two different meanings. "Field hockey" and "hockey field" aren't the same thing.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  :)<br>  <br>  <br>  C.|`|afcHyrqraa	campo de hockey
NGz7R9enaa	Not at all. When your granddaughter is old enough to be respectful and mature, then she is too old to get a spanking, but at that time no spankings are needed now are they?|`|FcZU29W6aa	You're treading a thin line here -- your daughter may resent your interference.  Unless it was a real beating, then the spanking decision is up to the parents.<br>  <br>  If was truly a beating, then I'd call Social Services.<br>  <br>  If was truly just a spanking, I bet your granddaughter learned her lesson and won't be using the F word again.  At least her parents are taking care of things instead of letting her grow up to be a spoiled brat with a sense of entitlement.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	I think not, some get spanked who are much older than 10.|`|AA10045620	No, she is not too old for a spanking for what she said, but she is old enough to have known better for saying it in the first place.|`|JGjpc7Itaa	Where did she learn that word?  I'd look within first to make sure she wasn't getting that word at home before punishing her like that.  I don't condone spankings.  There has to be a more effective way to punish a 10 year old.  I think the only time you smack a kid if is they are about to cause themselves harm like sticking their hand on the hot stove burner.  If you teach a kid that spanking or smacking them is okay then they will learn to do it as well.  Nope.  Don't like it.<br>  <br>  However, it is probably not your job to tell your daughter what you think.  Maybe you could nicely bring it up but don't argue with her about it since it is her child.|`|15a15c2941c45279684557afa9aaa35faa	What are you planning to say to your daughter when you speak to her??<br>  that is ok  your granddaughter disrespect her??  i would break her teeth<br>  and probably end up in jail. that is not very nice!!!<br>  I command your daughter for being a real parent and taking the responsibility a parent should take; this is what's wrong now days., everything goes; now is the time to nip it .<br>  your daughter is trying to make a lady out of her; so stay out.|`|0rpN2419aa	I got my last spanking when I was 12 and I turned out just fine!!!  Nobody thought of spanking as abuse in the good old days, they thought of it as discipline.  I also got  a good mouthful of soap when I was six and swore  when it lightening and thundered!  I would not be very happy with a 10 year old using the F word.|`|AA11296212	And tell her if the little girl does it again, give her daughter what Patty gave the drum.|`|420d72e7d945fb5cb4d470808614f009aa	Yes you should.  Say "Good for you!

At 10 did she know what she was saying? Did anyone bother to explain it to her?<br>  <br>  I think any age is too old for a spanking, I always like talking and explaining.<br>  If she chooses to use the word and it is no used by family members then I would ground, sit in a chair, or take privileges away.<br>  <br>  If it was my grand I would be talking to the parents nicely and explaining spanking just teaches hitting.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	No, keep quiet.  If she isn't old enough to know that that is not acceptable she is young enough to get a good spanking.|`|ku2tP4eEaa	Yes.  Especially since it is not something you can escape.  Children learn and use vulgar language whether we like it or not.  We cant monitor them 24/7.  If she is gonna talk nasty she'lll do it anyway when she is with her friends.  What she will do is not use certain words around the house.  So, the spanking was pretty much a waste.  All that can be done is let her know your preferences and feelings about certain language.<br>  <br>  You can say something.  But only as advice.  Do not get involved to the point were you are telling your daughter how to raise her daughter.  Might be prudent to wait till she ask.<br>  <br>  Are you people aware that washing a childs mouth out with soap is abuse?|`|GrKiEDb1aa	A butt busting and a bar of well lathered Fels Naphtha soap to chew on!<br>  She's lucky she didn't lose a few teeth.

Only if there is abuse, this is not abuse. I myself only gave one spank to get their attention to start the lecture.<br>        This child knew that the F word was not acceptable and was ready<br>  for the punishment. Got to stop this disrespect in the bud and a good spanking just might get her attention. I would not allow anyone to swear in my home and my now adult children still respect that rule.|`|AA12194228	Nope, she is not too old.

I would ask your daughter if she heard the word at home. If so, she may have felt comfortable using the word.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	I don't think I've seen a question get to many answers.I don't think spanking a 10 year old is to old as long as they know what the rules are that would earn them a spanking. It could be swearing, lying, breaking curfew, as long as the child knows that is what will happen if the rules are broken. I'd like to know where your granddaughter heard the word. Or if she had ever been told we don't use words like that in our home. I never spanked my daughter after I left my marriage when she was nine. I didn't have to. She was a good girl and today is a fantastic mother.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	Let her eat some soap|`|u3bNgwNSaa	no!<br>  i don't think it is...<br>  just tell her:<br>  <br>  Kids are kids!|`|nwnILcEAaa	I am 65, and to this day, I wouldn't say that to my mother. That is a total lack of respect and your daughter needs to do what is necessary to take control of that situation. I worry about why the girl thought she could get away with speaking to her mother in that manner, no matter what the issue was. They need to have some serious discussions about what type of behavior is or is not acceptable and where the boundaries are.|`|CkKlZFVmaa	Now that she has got her spanking, finish the lesson by washing out her mouth with soap!

She's just the right age to actually remember what she was spanked for.  It should make her remember how unacceptable this kind of language is and how disrespectful she was to her mother.  Children need to learn at an early age to respect their parents or by the time they are teenagers they will coming and going as they please and telling their parents to F off.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	If one of the kids drop the "F" word I give them the look and exclaim with a gasp "What did you just say?" and that is the end of that.<br>  Now, if a child said "F" you Mom/Grandma" I would probably have handled it differently but I would not have spanked them.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	obviously your daughter doesn't think she is too old. Perhaps you should stay out of it.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	I don't know. Does the girl's mom curse at home? Does anyone else curse in the home? <br>  <br>  I would advise your daughter to be very careful when spanking the child. She is striking the child and this can be construed as  physical abuse or aggravated assault.  She could be put in jail. <br>  <br>  Never refer to the punishment as a spanking, but she is using "corporal correction." (CC)<br>  <br>  If the child is bigger and can retaliate, then CC is not the way to go. But if the child is still physically manageable; then I would say it is alright and should be used, but only sparingly. <br>  <br>  In our home we used a board of education: A ping-pong paddle with holes drilled into the flat part to allow the air to flow freely. <br>  <br>  I would have the child clothed, bend over and touch his or her toes. Explain why the correction is being given and swiftly bring the paddle back and with a fast forward motion to land, stop abruptly onto the seat of the problem.  Repeating 2 or 3 times. <br>  <br>  Then the offender had to stand in a corner for 15 minutes to contemplate the misdeed. <br>  <br>  The problem usually did not repeat. No one liked the board of education to convene.|`|CrZxYK5raa	i get spanked with a leather belt if i cuss.<br>  10 is not to old i am 14 that i think is too old.|`|Yku6t8ulaa	I believe in spanking however, When it comes to cursing I think if the parents are always cursing around the child and the child gets punished for it, what kind of message are you sending them? You can curse but they shouldn't? Kids repeat what they hear!|`|yS5uy9NBaa	If you feel your grand daughter is being abused then you need to do something about it.  Otherwise don't get in the middle of it no matter what you feel.  She is the one raising the child.  I don't believe in spanking as a form of punishment.  I inflicted a much worse form of torture on my children.  I would sit them both on the couch after some infraction and apologize to them for what had happened as it had to be MY fault for being the world's worst parent and that I was going to try to do better from then on so that none of these situations would be created that would trap them into doing or saying something wrong.  Believe me, after about ten minutes of this, where they KNEW they had to sit quietly and seriously listen, I know they were praying to be adopted by a family who dealt with punishment with a few good whacks of the old belt.|`|IJMyRWp4aa	i got spanked from the time i was 3 or 4 til i was like 12 so in my opinion no she isnt. these days alot of kids could use a good spanking but there is a difference between spanking and abuse so just make sure she doesnt hit so hard that she leaves a mark.|`|y9N3DsKBaa	Stay out of it.

Maybe you can talk about discipline in a general way without inserting your own opinions (unless asked)|`|59Wg2cI3aa	To old ? -- not in the least. Maybe by the time she gets "too old" the spanking will have sunk in far enough for the instruction level to be reached.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (and a tip of the hat to your daughter in this permissive world)|`|MpskWQAyaa	I see people overreacting to simple words on this page like "oh how dare she say that which must not be named!!!" <br>  Yea I know she's 10...that means two things though<br>  <br>  1. She is young to be talking like that<br>  2. She is not too old for spanking.<br>  <br>  I say from experience, the day you can outrun your parents is the day you are too old for spanking...haha jk but really I think it will become inappropriate to spank her the day she is already matured enough body-wise to were it feels awkward and/or sexual.<br>  <br>  I won't be double standard like those who are all upset because of the word and at the same time tell you to butt out all rudely.<br>  <br>  but I will say, try not to interfere too much in disciplinary action. But if it becomes more an act of the parent taking out their anger on a kid and less about teaching, you should point it out to your daughter.<br>  <br>  also, keep in mind...being very physical with kids can sometimes teach them that is the way to solve problems, by getting physical.|`|GqUFQmBkaa	hitting kids, that is so prehistoric|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	No, but she is a bit young with the cussing.

You are focused on the spanking and not the foul language?  Your grand daughter needs to learn respect.  Children that allowed to be disrespectful will have problems in life.  They will always blame others for their problems will not become responsible adults.  It's ok for a child to have spunk but disrespect for others is not allowed even in today's Society.  Would your parents allow you to speak to them or any other adult with disrespect, if they did that is why you are questioning the punishment rather than the bad behavior.|`|16c836400ca09a5e1eadd5a523f3be35aa	she's being disciplined . you do the crime , you do the time . lol|`|hGsWp8EXaa	No she is not too old. If spanking is your corrective measure then it is warranted here. Saying it is wrong and saying it your parent/authority figure shows lack of respect. That needs to be stopped NOW.|`|Ldq6ql3vaa	no... she's not too old! and no mother deserves her kid saying the F word to her!|`|4fHLDG6Vaa	More importantly, isn't 10 years old a little young for the F word!  Personally I am against spanking.  However, if they do not get respect from their kids at ten then they never will. I would definitely think about where she became familiar with that particular retort (children do asthey see) and what were the circumstances. There are a lot of  ways to deal with this like a time out, a talk as to 'why ?' she felt she needed to speak that way or as my daughter has my grandchildren do if they lie or whatever (ages 7 and 9), write a page on why it was inappropriate.As with adults, it's often lack of any better way to express themselves. Do her parents cuss a lot?  Watch out tho might not be your business. Tough being a grandparent I know. Good luck|`|2bkV73gpaa	OK. That question brought back embarrassing memories!<br>  <br>  As with many questions, it sort of depends. Has that been the only time the girl has been spanked in years? Is she spanked for misbehaving in general or was this highly unusual? If your granddaughter has done things worse and wasn't spanked, then it probably wasn't fair. But if your daughter isn't abusive to her, your granddaughter's age shouldn't matter. It's what your granddaughter did (said) that does.<br>  <br>  I'm not in favor of spanking kids but I was spanked occasionally while growing up and I have to honestly say that if your daughter does spank your granddaughter at other times she has misbehaved or badly sassed back (and this isn't something new your daughter just started to do), then 10-years old isn't too old.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way:<br>  <br>  Ask yourself if your granddaughter was 5, would that be OK to spank her when she didn't even know what the F she was saying, but it's NOT ok to spank her at 10 when she should know better and show more respect to her mom?<br>  <br>  Are you opposed to spanking period? If so, you could tell your daughter that. But seriously. Why should the girl's age matter? Or a boy's age. Would it be OK if she was 9 instead of 10? Or what if she was a little older?<br>  <br>  When I was 12, my grandmother spanked me in a fitting room because I told my 5-year old cousin to turn the F around and close his #$%&ing eyes while I was embarrassed standing there topless while being fitted for a training bra.<br>  <br>  The year before that, my 5th grade substitute teacher spanked me for my telling an annoying boy who was bugging me in class to F off (ok, I also hit him too and called him a #$%&ing mariposa).<br>  <br>  It's way more embarrassing to be spanked when you're older, especially when in happens to you in front of other kids your age or younger. And unless it's borderline abusive, the pain of the spanking doesn't hurt anything like the humiliation does.<br>  <br>  Unless your daughter was hitting the girl severely, the embarrassment of her knowing that you and other family/friends know (or witnessed) the spanking will probably be more effective in helping her watch her choice of words with her mom than simply having her butt spanked. And your daughter probably thinks that too and that might be why she spanked her instead of grounding her or something.<br>  <br>  Does your daughter have other children? Does she spank them for mouthing off, including any son(s)? If so, then as long as she's being fair and punishing them evenly without showing favortism and without physical hurting them, I have to honestly say the spanking shouldn't be too big a deal. I sure your granddaughter must feel quite embarrassed but unless these spankings are severe, abusive or very frequent she'll get over the embarrassment. I did, although I still blush when around that male cousin of mine (he's now 16).<br>  <br>  I would say it also kind of depends on the context. My mom probably wouldn't have spanked me if she overheard me telling off some pervert in a store to F himself because he made a crude comment towards me, like ''nice a--.''<br>  <br>  Also, I guess technically you're not ''too old'' to be spanked until you're an adult. Sometimes not even then.<br>  <br>  One of my girlfriends once wrote a paper on corporal punishment in U.S. schools and found that an 18-year old high school senior teenage girl in Texas a few years ago was made to bend over and embarrass herself for a paddling even though she was technically an adult. I believe she lost a lawsuit against the male principal who spanked her. And all she did was smoke a cigarette (which she shouldn't have done, but still!). What was unfair was that she was a cheerleader and guys on the football who were caught smoking weren't paddled. I guess that pervert principal had his preference over who he wanted to spank or not. He even purposely delayed her spanking several days (when she was wearing pants) until calling her to the office on a day on which she was wearing a very short skirt! Hence her embarrassment when she was told to bend over in front of that creep and another male school official who was required to ''witness'' the punishment.<br>  <br>  Your granddaughter needs to show more respect to her mom. Maybe your should sit down and have a talk with her. Who knows. Maybe the spanking might do her some good if it helps her to avoid one at school. Because if she goes to a school in paddling state and talks that way to her teachers, I would have to feel sorry for her bottom.|`|1ypdlPWRaa	no you shouldn't say anything - its not your place - sorry i know its difficult but we raised our kids and we have to rely on them using the good judgment that we gave them.<br>  and yes she should have received a spanking - not a beating don't get me wrong - a spanking.   she needs to know that type of language is not acceptable in any way whatsoever and i for one applaud your daughter for doing what she did.<br>  perhaps if more parents were willing to discipline their children and show a little 'tough' love we wouldn't have so many issues with youngsters turning to crime. these swarmings are done by kids not much older than your g.d. - maybe if their parents had cared enough about them to discipline them they wouldn't be out at night beating up strangers.  its scary out there and a lot of the scary ones are young teens.|`|Ih2fKuZWaa	No, your daughter handled is like it should be.

If your Grand-daughter is being brought up right and knows how to respect her elders then she will have known she was wrong to swear to her mum and therefore take the consequences that go with it. Wouldn't it be better for her mum to discipline her than have someone like a neighbour or teacher complaining about her foul language because if her mum lets her off with it then she will only think thats its ok to say it to others. You should not interfer with your daughters way of raising HER kids unless you suspect abuse.|`|lISrOzyraa	18 is the age where you should stop disciplining your children.

Here's a quick test.  Have you ever told a lie, stolen anything, or used God's name in vain?  Jesus said, "Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.  Have you looked with lust? Will you be guilty on Judgment Day?  If you have done those things, God sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer-at-heart.  The Bible warns that if you are quilty you will end up in Hell. That's not God's will.  He sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross for you.  Jesus took your punishment upon Himslef.  "God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everylasting life."  Then He rose from the dead and defeated death.  Please, repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus, and God will grant you everlasting life.

I had a lot of trouble in my life and I just wanted to feel some kind of happiness. I was worried about my looks, money, how people perceived me...all the things just about everyone else worries about it. When I became a christian these things started going away. I found no comfort or fun in drinking or partying, I learned to save money, I found my direction and goals in life, I stopped thinking about my looks and developed a healthy self-image. I started eating better and thinking about how to be more active. I learned that no matter how nice I am someone is always going to hate me, that's life.

For example,  a blaspheming atheist, why would they go to Heaven? They wouldn't want to be there anyway. I've heard it said God doesn't send people to hell, they volunteer. God usually gives us lots of chances but when someone continually rebels, what is left? Ever heard of that phrase "you can't make someone love you?" same here. God did give us free will because he loves us so much. He can't make us do anything. If a person is not sorry for their sins and hates God, why would he let them into heaven?|`|lTDf23pnaa	To answer your doubt, it is imperative that one has the right perspective on who God is. <br>  <br>  1. He is our King, Friend, Father and Judge simultaneously.<br>  2. He is also all-knowing, which would also mean His ways are the best. <br>  <br>  As a King, his duties are to define the law. Since God is the ideal king, his laws must be for our good.<br>  <br>  As a Friend and Father, He would be slow to punish since He loves us as individual beings. As a result, God would be as merciful as He can, giving us sufficient chances to repent and meditate on His Word.<br>  <br>  Lastly, as a Judge, his duty entails enforcing the law. Being the ideal Judge who upholds the ideal law, he will not hesitate to punish those who clearly refuses to live by what is good.<br>  <br>  I suppose the problem lies with your perception of God as the ideal Judge. Is God a pushover that He should conform to what we want as flawed beings? If so, He is not God if he cannot enforce what He knows to be right!<br>  <br>  Freewill means God only wants those who truly loves him to be with Him, hence he is not impinging on our rights by letting us choose. Freewill is a good thing.<br>  <br>  Having freewill isn't a Get-Out-of-Jail free card. Having freewill also means that one is still responsible for his/her actions. For eg. Although the gun law in America is indirectly responsible for the increase in lethality of the criminals, should the criminals be pardoned?<br>  <br>  I'd also like to share a perspective with you.<br>  <br>  Have you ever considered that it is PRECISELY because God is loving and that He respects freewill that the unrepentant go to hell? (Take it weasy, read on. Keep in mind that God the Judge has to enforce the right punishments for sins. He cannot contradict on any of his roles.) <br>  <br>  His children have decided that they would not like to follow His ways, so He respects their decision and allows them to go a separate path. If one does not follow that which is right, they follow that which is wrong, hence they miss out on the goodness and inheritance of God.<br>  <br>  Imagine a father who knows that driving without the headlights on would result in a fatal accident. He warns and warns and warns, but the grown-up son does not listen. Indeed, trajedy does strike. <br>  <br>  Should the loving father forcefully enforce his will on the son, hence taking away the son's freedom to choose? Should he take freewill away?<br>  <br>  In other words, those who go to hell have chosen to go to hell when they decide that God isn't the way. This happens PRECISELY because God respects their freewill. <br>  <br>  So can God be blamed for the rebellion of man?|`|dYLwFmiwaa	well the whole hell thing is kind of debated. nobody really knows what he will do, so thats where purgatory came in. people thought that those people who arent absolutely coldhearted but not great people still had a chance. <br>  <br>  answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjOuOJj9Wfpj82p_iC2r9QTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309201954AAb7UiO">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|QF4W5aYRaa	If you don't love Him and want to please Him here, why in the world would He want you with Him for eternity??

Let's say a child does something wrong. He will be punished but his parents will still forgive him. You have to have punishment for the wrong things you do even if you're forgiven. So God forgives but he punishes. If he let everyone into heaven wouldn't the devil and demons and evil people be in heaven? Only Christians go to heaven. It's your choice. They are forgiven but if people choose not to believe they will be punished and won't be with God and be rewarded in heaven so they go to hell to punish them. How could we learn what to do and what not to do without punishment and rewarding? Also God will forgive you if you ask for forgiveness. Most people who go to hell probably never asked for forgiveness. I hope I answered your question.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	When people sin they are rejecting God. <br>  <br>  Often it is indirectly...they know God doesn't want them to do something, but they want to do it more than they care about pleasing God, so they reject Him and do what they want.<br>  <br>  Some people even directly reject God. Look around you here... do you see all the hateful posts attacking God?  "Why should we honor an insane god?" "Have the majortiy of christians on this site ever heard of education?" "A little discussion about this famous fairytale? I rember why im not friends with Christains now ... so stuck up."<br>  <br>  If someone wants to reject God, then that is their free choice to. For God to drag them into eternal communion with Him after they have chosen to reject him would be a violation of their free will, their free choice (and probably several anti-stalking laws as well). That is not how God works, but that is exactly what you are asking God to do. You are asking God to pre-emptively "forgive" people who refuse to ask to be forgiven, and drag them into Heaven by force of arms.<br>  <br>  God won't do that. Heaven is open for all who want to come, but you have to want to come. <br>  <br>  These people know the stakes. They have had fair warning.  It's their choice to make and their responsiblity... not yours, not mine and not God's.|`|vTzxxSTLaa	It is they who chose to not be forgiven  God`s righteousness the only requirement you need to enter the kingdom.|`|DArAz67Caa	do loving parents not spank their children when they misbehave----?? does our loving creator not punish his creations with they commit sin----??|`|AA11124121	All who are resurrected MUST go through the Son...and the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  They are the only way to be heard by YHWH.<br>  Only.. there is no other way..I am sorry..<br>  <br>  we were never promised partytime..|`|dm8aBiIVaa	God only gave people free will under the guidelines conditional under  not to sin. Only your soul is free, not the choices you make. <br>  <br>  I'm a christian and I may in fact burn in hell and I welcome it, I deserve to after all that God has done for me and I mock him. I'm ashamed of myself for being a sinner.|`|ljzb6fZBaa	To answer your question, I will share relevant portions of this website on "Benefits of the resurrection".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://finishedwork-rjw.blogspot.com/2009/01/scotty-todd-benefits-of-resurrection.html" rel="nofollow">http://finishedwork-rjw.blogspot.com/200...</a><br>  <br>  I Corinthians 15:1-4<br>  1: Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;<br>  2: By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.<br>  3: For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;<br>  4: And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.<br>  <br>  The scripture says of the resurrection of Christ that “we were raised up together with him”. The first benefit of our being raised is that we are forgiven. The whole world is forgiven. The whole world is not saved, but the whole world is forgiven. They have to first believe it. There is eternal salvation through an eternal sacrifice, but in order for that to function , there must be belief. “This is the will of the Father who sent me, that all who see the Son, and believe, will experience eternal life.” When a person sees, but does not believe, they do not experience eternal life. It is by grace, through faith that we are saved.<br>  <br>  -----<br>  <br>  Do feel free to visit the website to understand the gospel of grace more fully. God bless you.|`|303F69Woaa	Hell is nothing more than the common grave of mankind. The punishment for sin is death and God sent his Son, Jesus Christ to die for our sins so that we can gain back the everlasting life Adam lost for us when he disobeyed God. The eternal punishment for not accepting Jesus as your savior is non-existence not eternal, fiery torment.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	You do not become a child of God until you have been Born Again.<br>  <br>   John 3:3Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.<br>  <br>  You are the child of satan the devil before you became Born Again. If you refuse Jesus free gift of salvation, you remain the child of the devil.<br>  <br>   John 8:44Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.<br>  <br>  But for those who accept Jesus free gift of salvation...<br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 6:16-18 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.<br>  <br>  17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.<br>  <br>  18 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.<br>  <br>  It is only those who turn to Jesus with repentance and acceptance of Jesus as the son of God who died on the cross for their sins and rose again on the third day who have their sins forgiven. It's not an automatic thing. You must repent of your sins and ask the Lord for forgiveness.|`|AA11686091	God is loving but He's also just.  And justice means that He made a way for everyone.  But even He has to follow His rules.  Blood is the only thing that covers sin. His Son shed his blood so we could be free. People have a free choice to choose His way or not.  Because He's loving, He gives the choice.  He won't force Himself on anyone.<br>  <br>  A parent who truly loves his/her child will follow through when they say you will get this punishment if you do this thing.  God is just like a loving parent.|`|lJUyhMceaa	First, God is not obligated to do anything for those that are not His Children....although He will if they will only trust Him.  Remember, not everyone is God's child.  Only those who have called upon Him and trusted Jesus as their Saviour is the child of God.  Those who have not, are the child of the devil. One or the other is your spiritual father.  You decide which one you want.<br>  <br>  Secondly, even as humans, we raise our children the best we can, we teach them, we lead them, we provide for them.  But, once they leave our house, we are not responsible for them anymore.  When they do something they should not, and they get hurt, we don't like it, but there is nothing we can do about it....it is their decisions to make, and they must face the consequences from their decisions.<br>  <br>  It is the same with us.  God has done everything He can.  He has told us what we need to know, He has given us many examples to learn from.  He has worked in our life time and time again, and He even paid the price for our sins.  BUT, when we san "no", and go out and do our own thing, God is not obligated to step in and "rescue" us.  We must face the consequences of our action and decisions.<br>  <br>  Even as His Children, those of us who have trusted Him and accepted Jesus as our Saviour,  we don't obey God, and we still have to suffer the consequences of our decisions.  We are God's children, and He will save us in the end, but if we run away and do our own thing, God will let us. <br>  <br>  So don't blame God for your problems.  And if, or when, you wake up in hell, it won't be His fault.  It was you who chose to leave God and do your own thing.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	The forgiving power of Christ has been offered, but it is up to you to take it.

You've been asking this question all night long.<br>  <br>  YOU are the one who is going to have to make a hard decision.  <br>  <br>  You know it's NOT your fault that your mother is abusive.  You are 29 years old, and not a little girl who needs to stay at home.  You could get a super cheap apartment, and you could get public assistance until you're on your feet.  <br>  <br>  Tomorrow, get up in the morning and go to a friend's house, even if it's just for a night or two.  Take your son.  Give yourself a chance to get a different perspective on what you value and the kind of life YOU want to live and deserve to live -- and especially what your son deserves.<br>  <br>  Then, if you're in the USA, call 2-1-1 and speak to someone at the United Way, and tell them your situation and what you need.  They can refer you to housing, employment assistance, a case manager, etc., all of whom can help you make your dream life come true.  It's going to be hard, but there have been LOTS of women who have less than you and who have succeeded.  <br>  <br>  It's time to stop whining and take charge of yourself. It's time to be an adult now.  Set boundaries for your abusive (and probably mentally ill) mother and stick to them.  Let her know there are going to be consequences to her being so abusive and disrespectful.|`|faT4MyVkaa	I guess hang in there till your son attends school all day, and explain to him what she is doing is wrong.

The sooner you learn to put her out of your life the better you will be.

You really must ask yourself if you'd rather give your child a good house or a good family.|`|5AbCtkWFaa	You need to get out of your mom's house.  Nothing is worth the abuse you are taking.  Your son should not grow up in that toxic environment!  Nor should your younger sister, for that matter, but that is not your decision to make unless her safety and/or well-being are threatened by your mom.<br>  <br>  It's also quite possible your mom has a serious problem, in which case she needs to get help--by which I mean a psychiatrist, not a pastor.  As I don't know your family situation--was she always abusive, or is this new?  Is she abusive to your sister?--I can't say.<br>  <br>  You got pregnant, you decided to keep the child, try to work things out with the father, which is the smart thing to do, not necessarily the Christian thing to do.  But you do need to find a support system beyond the church so you can do right by your child.<br>  <br>  Silly question:  do you have any other relatives who can help you?|`|5Yh8WN1Oaa	If you're dealing with abuse, you need to get out of the situation. Sitting in a house like that is not doing you or your son any good. He's going to grow up thinking abuse is normal and potentially abuse people when he's older. It's a horrible situation you're in and you need to get out now. The longer you stay, the more damage is done. If you can afford to pay at your mom's house, you can afford an apartment. Your son having a large room and "safe" neighborhood does not mean anything in the long run. He's much safer with you two on your own than the abuse going on in your house. Seriously, for your sake and the sake of your son, get out!<br>  <br>  <br>  Losasha: That is such a cliche "Christian" answer. So disappointing.|`|AA10517807	so what is your question?<br>  oh ! remember know your mom is a b.itsch and she hates you but question, how at such an old age you put up with all that attitude have some respect and tell your mom to shove it.|`|AA10858522	This may sound dumb but some people need to feel like they are the dominant power. Some need to feel like they are the dominant female, especially around other women including family. She may have had a bad relationship with your father and takes it out on you or you may just be prettier than her which is very unsettling for most females. I know a bunch of women will get mad but that is a fact of life. She cares or she would kick you out. She feels as if she needs to constantly remind you that she is superior. Try a different approach. When she is sitting with her face all twisted up like she is mad again for no reason, ignore her. Ignore her every time and don't act defensive when she tries to have a confrontation. Use voice control. Stay monotone. Let your voice sound as if you couldn't care less. My father is the type to try and constantly dominate people and this has always worked for me. If you cannot deal with the drama, start your escape plan. Find a place and a good job. Find yourself a babysitter you can trust. Visit your mom once in a while, but keep your distance. This is about dominance. She has to be negative to you(in her mind) in order to feel she is the queen of the castle. As long as you live in her house you have to deal with her chaos. Does she treat your siblings the same way? Is she in an abusive relationship? Just a few things to look out for. The negative energy she focuses on you and lack of respect will be recognized by your child and could teach your child that your authority deserves no respect and that only your mother's word is the law. There is a lot more damage that can be done if you continue to remain under her roof. Get out ASAP!|`|P8dIznazaa	Your mother sounds like a real piece of work.  As with any abusive relationship, I'd strongly advise you to get the h*** out as soon as you're able.  Normally time with grandparents is very good for children, but not with abusive grandparents.  So what if you have to move into a small place?  He'll adjust, and he'll learn that the good things in life are mostly nonmaterial.  Get out before he's old enough to be damaged by this psychotic mother of yours.  Life on your own will be hard, but much easier on you emotionally, and altogether far easier in the long run.|`|YOxWMpWnaa	1- You can't change other people.<br>  <br>  2- It sounds like your son is growing up in a toxic environment and will be negatively impacted by your mother.<br>  <br>  3- It is better to be poor and in a loving environment than wealthy and in a hateful environment.<br>  <br>  4- No it is not your fault.<br>  <br>  <br>  What should you do?  Cut ties with your mother, it is the only way for you and your child to have a healthy life.|`|hvNqywbBaa	She is still your mom and you need to respect her. You didn't mention your father, maybe he could help out.<br>  But I don't understand why your not getting any child support from the father of your child. That's 4 years of child support.<br>  Also you can try for public assistance for housing, child care, food, etc til you get on your feet.<br>  I don't feel that it is good for your child to live in an environment that seems to be chaotic. A big house, his own room, etc is not want he needs.....maybe what he wants.....or what you want.... but it is still your mothers home. $200 a month for rent is really inexpensive <br>  I don't know why your mom is the way you say. I'm only hearing one side of the story. And I wouldn't necessarily blame it on her not being Christian. There are many non-Christian's that put Christians to shame for all the charitable things they do.<br>  Discuss your situation with your Church. Check on income based housing. And being 29, with a child, I think it's time to move out...get monetary help from your son's father and then visit your mom and sister.<br>  There are plenty of worse situations than what you are encountering.<br>  Continue praying. <br>  God be with you always.|`|oeO8Tgroaa	That is quite a bit of information, and many here are going to tear that up pretty good.<br>  <br>  I always ask those who do the abuse, what if you seen someone do that to your family, and they usually say I will kill them.<br>  So then I turn away and say, well time to kill yourself then I suppose according to your logic.<br>  <br>  Humans come in all formats, you have a path and that doesn't involve these people, you will find a great many that are going through far worse. At least you have internet, that child and the Lord.<br>  Your mom is your mom, be kind to her and remember heaven is waiting for you at her feet. Money is money it goes in pockets and they fill and empty. Who is greater to you in your life is your Lord, he gave you gifts and you have to know how to use them, he will ask you of them all when time comes.<br>  <br>  can you take any of that with you to heaven, I mean really read it for yourself again, are you writing a biography?|`|yN3fWUCuaa	I won't be as blunt as Losasha, but this mixed bag of anonymous people is not your best source for spiritual guidance, regardless of their intentions.<br>  <br>  I am glad to hear you have accepted Christ.

It doesn't appear healthy for any of the involved parties.<br>  <br>  Look around for a single mom's group.<br>  <br>  Seriously, you aren't going to find good answers out here.

Some of your answerers have given some pretty good advice.  All I wanted to add to it is pray hard and ask God what you should do, and you will know.  It will be that small voice within your conscience and may not like what it says, but that is how God speaks and aswers those who truly ask for his help<br>  <br>  Remember God knows your every thought, and he's probably answered you, but you've blown if off.  If you trust God, he will build your faith to do what is right and you will know what that is if you just listen to your own gut feelings.  God will be with you no matter what you decide.  But your child should be your first concern, but not in an atmosphere of  turmoil and strife.<br>  <br>  It's not easy doing what's right, but it will work out in the long run, for you and your son.<br>  <br>  If you decide to stay at home, with your troublesome mother, then be nice, as Patrick Swayze said in Road House.  You have to understand it's her house no matter how much rent you pay.  You are just a boarder to her, and she still sees that little girl she raised and who is still at home. <br>       As far as your freedom you have none while under anothers roof.  Your son is at an age where he will learn and hear things around him that will mold him into the kind of person he may grow up to be.  You want to have him around positive people who can show love and caring tendancies which you seem not to be around at this stage of his life.<br>  <br>  Ask and pray to God, and if your heart is sincere, he will answer you, but be prepared for the truth, for the truth sometimes is hard to swallow.  Following truth, builds faith, and through faith, you can do anything you set your mind to.
NWa45ZDIaa	Oh you poor thing. That's just sad. I agree with the answer's that said get out now! You will not be condemned as a Christian for protecting yourself or your son from any type of abuse, verbal, mental, emotional or physical. Though prayer will help you cope & deal with the terrible stress associated with abuse, it does not mean that it will protect you & your son from this ongoing treatment, especially if you stay in a position that subjects yourself to more abuse. Nor will it make what she's doing towards you "okay". It is NOT okay! No matter what religion or lack of religion your family claims. <br>  <br>  By protecting yourself & your son & moving out, or getting help from local authorities doesn't mean you're not "honoring your mother" or not living up to Christian standards. Jesus even ran & hid from abusive people while on earth. God does NOT expect his children to subject themselves to mistreatment. <br>  <br>  Here's some Bible based articles that may help, but I'd still suggest you seek help from authorities & not try to deal with this on your own. Perhaps in time your mother will change, I hope so, but don't sit around waiting for it to happen, thinking prayer is going to save you & your son.

And if she won't, you need to make it clear that there are consequences to her bad behavior -- you will move out and have limited contact with her.  Even if you have to go on welfare for a while in order to move out, it might be a good idea -- you must protect your child from emotional trauma, and you must  protect yourself, as well.<br>  <br>  It's misguided to stay and be abused just because you are a Christian and think you need to honor her.

Your faith in The Lord is bringing out the oppression she is under. Simply put, your Mom is oppressed by demons. They can't handle the light you bring forth. I have no authority for, or over you, so you will need to handle this on your end. For safety, pray and plead the blood of Jesus over yourself and your child. Ask God to intervene, to send warring angels to come and protect you. Tomorrow, seek out biblical deliverance ministry help. If your Mom has issues, sooner or later they will surface with you, maybe not as bad or immediate, but there is no reason to wait. The stronger, and prayed up you are, the less chance of hurt, emotionally, or physically. Again, read, study, pray. DAILY!! May The Lord bless and keep you safe, and guide your feet to the proper help. Thank You Father. In Jesus Name Amen.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Been there.

Double check that your order had the correct address on it.  <br>  <br>  The package may have been sent with signature confirmation which means you have to sign to get the package, which would explain why they would leave a notice instead of just leaving the package.  That could be the case if the material was age restricted or as a part of a delivery confirmation package.

1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	Leviticus 19:28<br>  <br>  "You shall not make any cuts in your body for the dead nor make any tattoo marks on yourselves.  I am the Lord."  While that is in the Old Testament and many Christians believe they don't have to follow the Old Testament, like my pastor often says the Ten Commandments are also Old Testament but Christians still embrace them.  Also, there is nowhere in the New Testament where Jesus actually says to forget about the Old Testament as none of it applies to us.|`|UinOWcMUaa	The Old Testament law commanded the Israelites, “Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the LORD” (Leviticus 19:28). So, even though believers today are not under the Old Testament law (Romans 10:4; Galatians 3:23-25; Ephesians 2:15), the fact that there was a command against tattoos should cause us to question. The New Testament does not say anything about whether a believer should or should not get a tattoo.|`|QYwbPBtCaa	Tattoos arn't good for you and you shouldn't mutilate your self just for fashion. But i think that what god meant was that you shouldn't have the tattoo that says "i am the LORD" on you.|`|cuo27bcIaa	Leviticus 19:28 says "Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the LORD."<br>  <br>  Are you wondering whether God would be OK with you getting a tattoo or body piercing? The above scripture kind of says "no", but then it's funny how in that same chapter there's a whole list of things that Christians wouldn't think twice about doing...<br>  <br>  Like wearing clothing made of two kinds of material<br>  Like eating meat with the blood still in it<br>  Like keeping your sideburns short<br>  <br>  The bottom line is, that what Christians consider wrong or right is not necessarily an accurate way to work out what's OK with God. Religious communities change their ideas over time (history gives plenty of examples of that). So instead of going by people's opinion, bring it back to the basics of you & God.<br>  <br>  Talk to God about it yourself. If you want to know if that scripture in Leviticus is His "no" to you, then just ask Him. A tattoo is something personal, so you're fine to talk to Him yourself and ask.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you and God will be cool with something that most other Christians aren't. Acting on it may not make you much loved or make you look very 'spiritual', but I think the more important thing is authenticity. Actually being authentic in your relationship with God. To me that's part and parcel of actually interacting with God personally. <br>  <br>  So it's up to you and God what you do... and whatever you decide, the Christians around you should know that it's up to them to judge (although some may make it their mission to do just that)|`|rU6nh42Eaa	The verses in Leviticus are about the practice of marking or scarring yourself in mourning for the dead, or in rituals of other religions.  God says that should not be done.  We should respect our bodies and not mutilate ourselves in mourning.  There is nothing about decorative tattoos or piercings, but in respect for our bodies, we shouldn't do things that can't be undone.  Those things also can create a negative impression on some people, and the Bible says to respect that.|`|vvgodUChaa	christ ussered  in a new covenant at his death on the cross, where he took away the sins of the whole world never to see them again,read the new covenant hebrews 10:16-18 even it is was a sin christ has taken it away never to see it again,he has given us new life today, read romans1st chapter to 12 chapter good stuff,christ has done it all now walk in it.he want to live his life in and through you he will lead you into all truth,stay in the new testament but read daily he has given us the right to be a child of god that is our idenity today,check out wwwrealanswers.net/radio click the callender any day and listen good stuff.
PtIyg9Qqaa	Someone once said faith is an action word.<br>  <br>  Belief and faith are not the same.  Let's say I walk into a room and want to sit on a chair.  I don't agonize over whether I should sit or not.  I don't rationalize whether a chair will hold me or not.  I simply believe that it will.  But I'll never know until I sit in it.  That's where faith comes in.  When I sit down, that is faith putting belief into action.<br>  <br>  James 2:19 says, "The devils also believe and tremble."  Demons believe in God.  But they don't put their trust in him and work for him. James also said, "Faith without works is dead."  Pretty much the same as I said above, huh?  You must actually DO something to show faith.|`|vvgodUChaa	when talking about faith,we are talking about depence.someone one once said .faith is action taken on the part of man toward a promise made by god.we can trust what he says in his word.to walk by faith means to walk in dependence not only on the written word.but also on the living word,who is christ.faith is a conscious choice to believe and trust what he said and did on our behalf. the new testament consistently tells us first who we are,then exhorts us to present ourselves to god in dependent faith.learning to walk in these truths does not happen overnight.it requires the ongoing ministry of the holy spirit through the scriptures.faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see hebrews11:1 question can we walk by faith and by sight at the same time, no|`|40527ad60966d944ca757e8d6d1c6c28aa	Fact doesn't constitute knowledge.

Therefore, I decided to work at a Korean restaurant to communicate with people, and I started to earn money when I first came to America. The personality trait that I am most ashamed of was putting too much emphasis on money. I started to earn money when I first came to America because I thought money was the best.

AyEkA6Flaa	If he is gay-friendly and not massively homophobic, then yes, you should tell him of your feelings and your struggle.<br>  <br>  If he is a close friend, and gay himself, he will understand and support you.<br>  <br>  If he is not gay himself, he will likely respect you enough to deal with it.<br>  <br>  I'm afraid that if you do not tell him, the secret will consume you inside and make you miserable.  It will weird things out between you.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, if he if homophobic, he will reject you if he learns you have romantic feelings for him.  In that case, don't mention the feelings, but do try to be affectionate, like, giving hugs and such.<br>  <br>  If you love him, honestly, you need his hugs really badly right now.<br>  <br>  Eventually you will have to deal with your religious and moral beliefs.  I used to be self-loathing and in deep denial of my gay feelings for many years because I thought God would never accept it.  I know better now, and I only wish I had saved myself years of misery.<br>  <br>  But regardless of whether you ever act romantically on your feelings, please, DO NOT deny yourself his support, his friendship, and his hugs.  Seriously, snuggle with this guy, like a brother, maybe snuggle under a blanket while watching a movie together.  You need the physical contact or you will go insane.<br>  <br>  Please know you are a good and beautiful child of God, and he loves you totally, just as you are.<br>  <br>  Hugs!|`|DIqqgNaVaa	well i would support themand let them know that i still cared about them|`|46rvOfL2aa	Well, it depends, do you mean best friend besides the guy I like...?<br>  Cause I've though about it for all of my friends, and it really depends on the person.<br>  It would matter more of how I'd answer if I liked them back.<br>  But, if they were battling their religion or moral values I'd tell them to take a look at life and really ask if it's a choice, or if it's just how they are. <br>  And, if it all broke down it it, how just their moral values/religious beliefs were if they forbade love?<br>  I'm just wondering if your religion is Christianity, because the way I see it, God didn't write the bible, he gave us the ten commandments and that was it.

jnnIwdtyaa	Merry Meet,<br>  <br>  I hope the following helps out.<br>  <br>  01. Wicca is an oath-bound mystery religion, each Wiccan should either be Dedicated or Initiated as a Wiccan to be considered a Wiccan by their peers and/or the general Wiccan community.<br>  02. Wiccan’s are polytheistic, honoring a variety of gods and goddesses.<br>  03. Wiccan’s are also dualistic, seeing individual deities, at least to some extent, as aspects of one God and one Goddess.<br>  04. Wiccans are also pantheistic do some degree or another, viewing divinity as immanent within the natural world.<br>  05. Wicca encompasses the practice of magick even though many Wiccans don’t practice magick.<br>  06. Wiccan’s show religious devotion to the Goddess and/or God (depending upon Tradition).<br>  07. Wicca’s ethical basis is expressed in the Wiccan Rede ("An it harm none, do as ye will"), and the Threefold Law ("What ye send returns three times over").<br>  08. Wiccan Ritual usually involves casting a circle as the basic setting for spiritual and magical work, as well as emphasizes the Platonic four elements of earth, air, fire and water and some form of gender polarity, be that theologically in the image of the God and Goddess, and/or mundanely in the physical gender of participants as well.<br>  09. Wiccan’s more often than not incorporate some form of the "Great Rite" (union of the God and Goddess), frequently symbolized in the blessing of the ritual wine by the conjoining of the athame (ritual knife) and chalice (ritual wine cup).<br>  10. Wicca as it is known today with two cc’s came into being in the mid 1940’s, it was popularized in the mid 1960’s. But Wicca itself originates from Pre-Christian pagan belief system from all over Europe. Some (not all) Traditions in Wicca also incorporate the use of ceremonial magic, high magic and even Alchemistry which also predates Christianity<br>  <br>  Blessed Be<br>  <br>  Nyjh|`|WjRqYf6naa	These Eight words the (Wiccan) Rede fulfill:<br>  "An Ye Harm None, Do What Ye Will"|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: it's a very life affirming, loving religion, as are the other pagan religions.  There is no "sin" in Wicca, there is responsibility.  If something harms someone, don't do it.  It's actually more ethically centered than some other religions.<br>  <br>  You might be drawn to the element of fire. Does that mean you have powers like in movies or on Charmed? No, it doesn't.  Wicca is a religion, not a Hollywood movie.<br>  <br>  1) Ignore the fundies saying you’ll go to hell and are opening yourself up to demons. We don’t believe in either.<br>  2) Get the book: Wicca, a Guide for the Solitary Practitioner by Scott Cunningham (Amazon.com used books is a great resource)<br>  3) Avoid Silver Ravenwolf, DJ Conway and most Llewellyn books<br>  4) Do NOT pay for lessons over the internet.

Wiccans are polytheistic.<br>  <br>  Wiccans do believe in right and wrong and urge people to do the right thing.  however, they do not have a handy list of sins for people to avoid.

If you can come to some understanding of "why" your father beat your mother, as well as "why" she put up with it as long as she did, you have a better chance of understanding yourself. How do you process anger and hurt feelings? How do you handle issues of power in relationships? What do you feel your roles are in any particular relationship? These are all questions that we should think about, and there are lots more. A good relationship or family counselor can help you examine yourself, and understand what is within you.<br>  <br>  You need to do some healing. I hope you realize that. Even if your parents never beat on you, you were exposed to a violent, abusive, dysfunctional relationship as a child. It's called "collateral damage", and it sucks. <br>  <br>  I hope you find the help and peace you need.|`|2Dm2hxOWaa	thats not always true in an enormous aray of lesbien relationships violence is not always portrayed nevertheless u may become what u fear the most that is true for most adults who were raised in a negitive enviroment however the same is not always said for all people who have experienced some sort of negitive enviroment i hope thats how it is for you<br>  *sighs a sigh of relief*<br>  WOW i never been so serious LOL didnt i sound smart lol|`|fgxajTiBaa	There is an equal amount of violence across the board in hetero and homo relationships. Unfortunetely it is a real statistic that children who grow up in an abusive home tend to end up in abusive relationships. I work at a Battered Women's shelter and it's amazing how true that stat holds. But it often ends up that the child becomes the victim in their relationship, not necessarily the batterer.<br>  <br>  Educating yourself on signs that someone is abusive is the best thing you can do. Batterers like to be in control, end of story. That's what all abuse is about, it is a means of controlling one's partner. Whether it be through money, emotional abuse, physical abuse or sexual abuse. Homosexual relationships have an added aspect of 'outing' abuse. Partners will sometimes use the fact that someone is not out as leverage to make them do what they want.<br>  <br>  You seem very aware of yourself, just keep your head held high and make sure you find someone deserving of you. Good luck.

I'll give you a hint - it was not used in reference to biological genealogy. Jewish genealogies traced legal ancenstry, not biological ancestry.|`|j1vjNjDiaa	Now there is a very Curious story in Numbers 27:1-11 & Num 36:1-12<br>  Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, ... Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah,<br>  Milcah &Tirtzah. Now these 5 sisters had a problem as they had no brothers, so they could not inherit land & their father's name would be<br>  lost & removed from among his family.<br>  A ruling was made that they could inherit as sons & carry on their<br>  fathers name, the only criteria was that they had to marry someone<br>  from their own tribe, so that land was not lost to a particular tribe, in <br>  this case Manasseh would have lost land if the women married out<br>  of Manasseh.<br>  Nothing is just in the Scripture for no reason, everything means some-<br>  thing.<br>  No mention is made of Mary's brothers & I feel that this above story is<br>  the same sort of situation. She married Joseph from the tribe of Judah,<br>  therefore, if this is the case,her first child would have inherited the land<br>  & the name. It is definitely feasible, from the point of Scriptural law.<br>  The case of Ruth & Boaz is another situation, with land & name.<br>  THEREFORE Mary's genealogy would have come into play & the<br>  grandfathers would have been different as Y'shua would have inherited<br>  after His mothers line, as Heli's grandson, not Joseph's son, which would explain a lot of things.|`|566cnzTyaa	One is through Mary and the other through Joseph.

Christ promised that the gates of Hell would not prevail against His Church, and here, all these centuries later, Catholicism is still going strong despite attacks against Her.<br>  <br>  Compare that to all the hundreds and hundreds of Protestant denominations that have split off from other Protestant churches.

The greatest men and women I have met in the Catholic church believed in other religions, inter-faith dialogue, personal and private revelation and a dose of secular humanism.  But by itself it is the wrong way to go.  It is too dogmatic and narrow-minded.  Many people in the church are close to Mary worship (i.e., those who say the rosary) and the belief in a co-redemptrix next to Christ. There IS a sense of "our way is THE way" and there is a ton of hypocrisy with the clergy. Do you want to deal with that kind of beaurocracy?

In the Juedeo-Christian faith that god is Yaweh, and all of its sects believe in that same god in varying ways.  So when you ask why is God a Christian, first you should understand that it's a circular question.  The Christian god is Christian because he's the Christian God, etc.  Same will go for every other faith or religion.  The Hindu gods are Hindu because they are the Hindu gods, etc.  Although this isn't really accurate as gods are to my knowledge rarely if ever described as being followers of the religions based on their worship.<br>  <br>  In speaking of the Christian god, he isn't a Christian.

kKACyAM8aa	We should all have the right to be miserable.|`|6ELSwKKvaa	I think they should have the right to get married and the law should not have anything to say about it. It should not go up for a popular vote because it goes along with their basic rights. The only reason to ban gay marriage is for religious reasons and there should be a separation between Church and State.<br>  <br>   I also believe in gay marriage because of my own Christian beliefs. Any sex outside of marriage is a sin according to the 10 commandments. By not allowing gay marriage, we are forcing them to sin according to the commandments. (As for the same sex passages in the Bible that seem to condemn homosexuality... I understand them in their proper context.) There are homosexual Christians who would like to remain in God's favor and the law is getting in the way of them being able to practice their religion. (Again, the law interfering with the way that someone is allowed to practice their faith is against our constitutional rights)|`|P8CBDLiKaa	I can't see any way that same sex marriage can have a detrimental effect on society, so...I'm all for it.|`|2a31fdee1fddb6a3055ca7fae75fc902aa	I support it.|`|EPN0ZBAJaa	they love each other, leave the alone and let them get married!<br>  People get married for money, just to get married, scared to be alone...many reasons, but when the same sex ppl want to get married we make a big deal why? <br>  Leave them alone, they're Happy|`|mCdaoFafaa	I don't completely get it, but that's because I hate the idea of marriage.

AA11690436	I agree.  Because infants are born unable to focus their eyes doesn't mean they are born blind.  Feral children (those who survive in the absence of other humans), once they gain language skills, are able to tell therapists their ideas about what their situation was.  We are pattern seeking beings.  In the absence of anyone to tell us otherwise, that face we see in the shapes of Clouds might as well be the face of some actual supernatural beings.

I think we can see evidence of God in nature,  even though most of us learn more details from our families, friends, and society as we mature.<br>  <br>  Atheism is not the mere lack of a belief.  It is the belief that God does not exist.   That is something that no infant believes.<br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic  <br>  Peace be with you,  and with everyone else.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:   It is dishonest to claim that the word "atheist" means merely a lack of belief in God.   In actual practice, "atheist" refers to a belief that there is no god.   If the word referred to merely a lack of belief,  we would not see so many people apply the word to themselves.   People do not intend to declare their ignorance when they declare their atheism.|`|LGBNKuxRaa	many adults can't coherently argue about the existence of god either. where does that leave them?|`|4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	"Atheism" = "a" + "theism" = "without" + "belief in deity".<br>  <br>  Atheism simply means "having no belief in deity".  It does not necessarily mean "making a positive assertion that deities do not exist".  Reread those last two sentences 12 times until it sinks in.<br>  <br>  We are all born without a belief in deity.  Therefore, we are all technically born atheist, just as we are also born apolitical since we're born with no knowledge of politics.|`|06aceb1d90d3755e9049c8a9a59210ddaa	This is more a question of definition.

In one question I asked if a box of hair was also atheist.  And in another a not-so-bright atheist here actually said you use more brainpower to jump off a bridge than be atheist as "atheism" is the default position to hold.  Ironically, he was arguing in favor of the "retort" that "everyone is born atheist"..I dunno, if my worldview was less challenging than jumping off a bridge, I might have to rethink things.|`|KVirP3bsaa	Anything that lacks the belief in a deity is atheistic.<br>  <br>  Trees, insects, rocks, etc, are unable to believe anything. So holding a belief in a deity for them is out of the question, leaving them in the default position, atheism. Just as a baby who has yet to be indoctrinated into any religion lacks the belief in a deity.|`|c5ffa63bef1a57e12459947bb46f6b28aa	Because until we're about 8 we live on beliefs in silly and insubstantial things like the tooth fairy and santa claus.  Only at about that age do we start to doubt that and our parent supplant those beliefs with god beliefs.  Until that age we simply aren't able to critically analyze a belief, to see through it.  In fact, after that, until the age of 10 we aren't really able to punch through the whole god belief fog our parents try to instill in us, if they're so inclined.  So, no, if you don't introduce your kids to god before 10, they'll never take it.  Never.  Ergo, people are born atheist.|`|yu53u5TFaa	"No one is born religious."<br>  <br>  So you mean, everyone is born atheist. Atheist just means a lack of belief in gods.

g4nlUfmeaa	Peripheral sensory cues ... a sound you don't even register as hearing, a small displacement of air, a slight smell or odor, a tiny change in room temperature, a shifting shadow in the corner of your eye.  Your subconscious assimilates this information and you become aware that something is "off," and you'll often interpret the "off" sensation as the feeling that you're not alone.<br>  <br>  Throughout most of our evolutionary history, we would have been prey to many species (also, violence within the species has always been an issue).  Being a little jumpy and suspecting that you're being watched by someone/something would have its advantages.<br>  <br>  Also, we're social animals.  We very good at running social simulations and perceiving intelligence/agency.  We make such extensive use of our "theory of mind" that we often do it without conscious effort, as a reflex.  It's not such a stretch to imagine that we reflexively apply our social simulator to things we only barely conscious of.<br>  <br>  Add to that the phenomenon of confirmation bias.  We often remember when we make an amazing guess that someone is silently watching us, but forget most of the times when we're wrong.  That's because the times that we're right are more dramatic, and thus easier to remember.  So it's easy to be seduced into thinking that our ability to tell that we're being watched is more uncannily accurate than it really is.|`|pd16sn5vaa	Im not sure.

Having a woman with multiple men, much as prostitutes do, has a down side for each of them if for them marriage is entered into for procreation. Again this is not an imperative reason to prohibit.<br>  <br>  The single most compelling requirement would be that divorce would be available to all, on demand. Whether man or woman, if one publishes an intent to divorce, that becomes  a divorce.  If a woman does not consent to her husband taking a second wife, publish the intent to divorce. And she has to sign a permission for him to marry a second woman. He does not want to stay with just one, he can publish his intent to divorce.<br>  <br>  I can not say that we would have a large number of polygamous households with these rules. But if there is real consent all round, it will occasionally happen. Some rethinking of prenup agreements might be wise.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Technically, there is nothing wrong with any form of marriage between consenting adults. Various forms exist, and have existed, throughout the world since history began. Polygamy and Polyandry are still practiced in the world. Same-sex marriage was once widespread, but fell out of favor thanks to homophobic European colonizers.<br>  <br>  Scripture forbids polygamy only to clergy. It says nothing about polyandry (since it was unknown to the Jewish culture), and the Hebrew OT does record same-sex marriage... without condemnation.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	Before I answer a question, I try to put my feet in everybody's shoes.  I realize that there are a lot of dysfunctional families but there's nothing more confusing than having a family of 40 siblings or so, living under the same roof.  It's already confusing enough to understand why they have the same father but different mothers.  Imagine trying to figure out who's who if the women are allowed to marry different men too.  Would they be living under the same roof?  If not, when and which children would visit the other parents.  After a while, imagine two of those children falling in love and trying to figure out if they're related or not.  More than likely, they would be but who knows for sure.  That would be a lot of paternity tests and a lot of confusion.  Men have pride too, some are really possessive.  I wouldn't want to be around when one has a fit of jealousy.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Polygamy is death to any society that allows it. The powerful patriarchal males monopolize the females. The majority of males, without women, filled with sexual tensions, redirect those energies into crime or terrorism -- they are easily manipulated by the patriarchs. The women end up cheated -- so do the children. Read your Old Testament -- polygamy always led to big trouble.|`|dtrYjyYZaa	The government needs to stay out of the marriage business Period!  <br>  It is a means for revenue for the government, ie marriage licenses and court fees for divorce.

I simply don't care, and I don't think anyone is harmed in that situation.|`|wZEGi1EHaa	nope|`|g4nlUfmeaa	I have no problem with the practice of polygamy (or polyandry) in theory, but often the cultures which feature the former are what I'd call patriarchal to a fault, and backwards.  Here in the US, the sects that practice polygamy also tend to practice child abuse, incest, rape, etc. in a manner that is justified (if not supported) by their culture.  Of course, the fact that polygamy is illegal means that it's pushed to the fringes of society, and will only be practiced by folks without the usual regard for what the rest of society thinks.<br>  <br>  And no, there isn't anything wrong with gay marriage.|`|Sn0CViR7aa	Neither polygamy nor homosexual relations meets the test of marriage, which has always meant the mating union of one man and one woman.  Note that marriage is practiced with fidelity in countries like India and China, where Christianity is only a footnote.<br>  <br>  Mating couples will make babies, either with or without marriage.  The reason for marriage is to encourage the mother and father to commit themselves to a permanent partnership in raising their children.  Children living with both biological parents demonstrate advantages in physical health, mental health, school achievement, obedience to law, and ability to establish close friendships and eventual marriages of their own. <br>  <br>  In polygamy, the women do not have the sexually exclusive promise of complete love from the man who holds multiple women in his harem.  A woman with more than one husband is similarly not fully committed to the union.  Such relationships do not confer the sort of advantages to children, who may not even know which of the temporary sexual partners are parents.  In any such "open" relationship, there is a much greater danger of sexual abuse to children.<br>  <br>  Homosexuals have a perfect right to marry like everyone else.  However, marriage requires a consenting adult nonrelative of the opposite sex.  This means that homosexuals will have considerable emotional relearning to accomplish to resist the temptation to return to sexual deviance and to acquire habits of sexual fidelity.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Bruce|`|4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	Inherently?

It's not for everybody, though.  <br>  <br>  The only time I would consider it "wrong" is if one is in an established "relationship" and is getting involved without their partner's consent (a.k.a. cheating), or if people are getting into it when they can't handle the emotional responsibilities that come with it.  I have known plenty of happy polygamous people.  But I've also seen people who think that they WANT polygamy, only to find out that they can't keep their different emotional commitments straight when it comes to their partners, and it turns out to be a disaster.  That doesn't make polygamy itself wrong, just as a quadriplegic who dies while trying to swim doesn't make swimming wrong; it's just the person's bad choice for what they can handle.|`|AA10031161	The challenge with this question is that "Right" and "Wrong" are very subjective.<br>  <br>  If we limit contractual (after all, a marriage is a kind of contract, right?) sexual relations to being between legally-consentual adults.. well, there are still those who find some things "wrong" that others have no problems with.<br>  <br>  I personally feel that homosexuality is not effective in the grander scheme of things. It definitely is not a "fit-for-survival" behavior, and it is actually physically damaging (at least male-male homosexuality is.. maybe I'll explain in a private email).<br>  <br>  So let's say we limit these contractual sexual relations to adults and heterosexual situations only... The question becomes "What could be wrong with having more than one partner?"<br>  <br>  I have two opinions about this.<br>  <br>  1- Promiscuity is dangerous. With all the STDs out there, as well as the risk of broken hearts/homes, guilt, and pregnancy, I see taking multiple partners as a dangerous behavior.<br>  <br>  2- I know you're not talking about frivolous sex, though. You're talking about concurrent monogamy (if that's not an oxymoron!). Traditional values (Victorian prudishness?) views multiple partners in any setting as inappropriate.<br>  <br>  <br>  On a personal note-----<br>  I know that I'd struggle with living a polyandrous (one wife, multi-husband) or a poygenous (one husband, multi-wife) lifestyle.<br>  <br>  On one hand, I'd be required to "service"/satisfy and take care of more than one guy-- sex, housekeeping, emotional attention, cooking, etc. Sometimes I can't handle the one I have!!<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I'd be required to "share" my husband. Sure, I may get help in the house-work department, but I admit to being a little jealous on that issue, so I know I'd struggle with "sharing"...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In conclusion (I know you were waiting for that, huh!)..<br>  I think many people's hangup with plural marraige of any kind stems from "tradition"... "Traditional values (Victorian prudishness?) views multiple partners in any setting as inappropriate."|`|FhHklqkhaa	Bruce - gays aren't deviants and can be faithful<br>  marriage used  to be between same-sex couples until 342 AD when Constius and Constans (two roman emperors) banned it to get closer ties to christianity<br>  I don't think there's anything wrong with polygamy<br>  I think consenting adults should be left alone, many christians wanna protect marriage from being redefined so they should logically be for same-sex marriage|`|c316178951b8605e913804fde0cb6becaa	I had to think about this one for a bit.<br>  <br>  I do not have a problem w/ any of the unions, as long as they are all consenting adults.<br>  <br>  But I do not think they should all be called a 'marriage'.<br>  <br>  In polygamy, they are husband and wife under marriage because she is not married to the other wives.  He simply has more than one marriage contract at once.<br>  <br>  Same w/ polyandry, but reverse.<br>  <br>  There is a different set of terms for groupings where you have several males and several females all bound to everyone (IE: 2 men, 2 women ,the women are in a union to one another and to each of the males, same for the guys), but I can't think of what it is right now.<br>  <br>  My feeling is that when it is not a contract between a male and female (IE: gay marriage), they should call it something different.  For one, it makes it easier to distinguish what you are talking about.  Two, it makes genealogical records so much easier when you have someone with a name that could be male or female (like Jesse).  And third, if you use a different term for the contract between same sexes, if a church does not wish to deal with same sex unions, they don't have to worry as much about getting sued for discrimination because they can lay out in their doctrine we perform marriage ceremonies, not union (or whatever you want to call it) ceremonies.<br>  <br>  *And to whoever is going to jump up and say, no one would sue a church for not marrying a gay couple because they don't want to be in that church anyways.  Yea, just like the lesbian couple in Mass. wouldn't sue the fertility doctor because he did not wish to implant an embryo in one of them because he didn't agree with their lifestyle, so referred them to another competent doctor that was willing to perform the procedure.  Some people, in ever culture/group, just like to try and force others to 'accept' them.*|`|AA10637643	Let's first set aside the fact that God has said marriage should be between a man and woman.  We'll have to also set aside the fact that marriage is ordained of God and sealed through the divine authority of the Priesthood.<br>  <br>  (We must also assume you or whomever believe the gospel to be true.)<br>  <br>  OK.  According to the gospel, exaltation is the highest degree or blessing one can attain.  I would think that *should* be everyone's ultimate goal.  Exaltation.  Now, in order to obtain that highest degree, a man and woman (women) must enter into the new and everlasting covenant of marriage AND keep their covenants.  The covenant is entered into by the couple and God and bound by the Holy Priesthood.  There is God, the Preisthood holder and the woman.<br>  To me, the Priesthood holder is esentiall the "covenant maker", for the covenant is not valid without the Priesthood holder.<br>  OK, so my own thoughts here, let's say same-sex marriage was legal... BUT, two Priesthood holders could not enter into one covenant.  I think there is something about the "one" covenant maker, and he is the "one" Priesthood holder.  Then if you thik about two women, there is no covenant able to be made, so of course that is also out of line with God's eternal plan.<br>  I don't think it's a matter of "what's right or wrong"... I really think it has to do with two men cannot covenant together nor can two women.  I really think it has a lot to do with the Priesthood, who holds it and who doesn't.  Even if both men are Priesthood holders...<br>  <br>  The main reason I believe same-sex marriage is wrong, other than the obvious, is because it cannot lead to an eternal marriage.  For that matter, any civil unions don't either, so technically they are "wrong" too I guess.  Wrong according to the gospel.  Not wrong morally.  If that makes sense...<br>  <br>  I think it is actually a great blessing for those in the circumstance who have had a spouse die and remarry and are able to be sealed for eternity.  I mean, that shows to me that our Father in Heaven loves us very much.  We can only see the carnal side of plural wives, which that carnality will not exist in the next life, so I don't see what the big deal is.<br>  <br>  So, long answer, I think there is nothing wrong with polygamy *when* appropirately abided by.  I DO oppose gay marriage.|`|2KZo9EpKaa	What is this world coming to?<br>  <br>  If there are consenting adults out there who want to do that, sure, why not?  Everyone has the freedom to choose, and I'm not going to deny rights from people.  I do frown upon gay marriage, and if there was polygamy the country would be a lot different.  Things should be the way they are until God says otherwise.|`|c3512f9d86066e8758051d031b18adeeaa	i say to each their own.  i couldn't do the polygamy thing.  disappoint multiple women at the same time?  be nagged by multiple women?  no thanks!  share a woman?  ugh....no.  <br>  <br>  nothing wrong with gay marriage.  gays have the right to be just as miserable as straight married couples in my opinion.  <br>  <br>  marriage is overrated.  i should know, i've been married twice.  all it does is support a consumer capitalist agenda.  never again.|`|Ya4jDBhEaa	Marriage between one woman and one man is the most significant model instituted by God for eternal salvation.

As far as I know, most states (in the United States) have laws that prohibit bigamy, of which polygamy is a form.<br>  <br>  That makes polygamy illegal.<br>  <br>  Edit: It is illegal. Beyond that, I don't have an opinion, other than it is present in a significant world religion - Islam, which makes the laws against bigamy (as they exist now) in conflict with the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The supreme court, sometime in the late 1800s overruled the first amendment and declared the laws prohibiting polygamy to be legal, regardless of religious practices.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure that would be the case today, but no one has ever challenged the laws and taken them back up to the Supreme Court. Until that happens, it remains illegal.<br>  <br>  As to anything wrong with it, it was practiced in the Old Testament, notably by Moses, _before_ being called by God to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt and before him the three main patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br>  <br>  No complaints from God. No complaints from me.<br>  <br>  Does it go both ways? I really don't know and don't care. It is still illegal in the United States.|`|D6FBLQfwaa	In my opinion, no, there is nothing wrong with polygamy or gay marriage. Human beings are animals that are naturally inclined to procreate with multiple partners in order to sustain the species. Scientific studies have shown that chemically speaking "love" only lasts three to seven years before the brain wants to move on! Also, If evolution has brought about homosexuality, then homosexuals should be equally allowed to have sexual relations with whoever they so choose, and denying them that is not only morally wrong (in my opinion) but also scientifically contradictory. I believe homosexuality is a result of over-population, so it's beneficial, but that's a different argument.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	Polygamy always works out to be one man and multiple women. Men wouldn't put up with sharing a woman.<br>  <br>  It's demeaning and undignified to have to not only share your husband with a competitor, but to be expected to put up with her in your home. If my husband were unfaithful, I'd prefer he not bring the bimbo back home.<br>  <br>  The way it works in real life is the man keeps bringing in new younger women every 10-15 years as he tires of the old ones. We have decades of LDS polygamy in genealogical records to show it, over and over.<br>  <br>  There are few men today who can support a big family. Polygamists almost all rely on the government to support them. As a taxpayer, I think we have bigger issues to put our taxes toward right now.<br>  <br>  I have no problem at all with gay marriage, but polygamy is a relic of the past.|`|K2UspSHAaa	I would agree with you ...only because I feel that no human being has the right to tell another human being how to live thier lives.<br>     i personally disagree with polygamy, simply because it is not the type of environment I was raised in...and polygamist  communities, although based in religion typically have very scandalous activities going on when they think no one is looking. Polygamy is full of incest, arranged marriage, sex with minors, rape etc. <br>     and how can anyone truly be happy sharing their spouse with 6 other people?<br>      As far as gay marriage, I think it should be legal in every state, because we can't tell people how to live thier lives.|`|BgASHCXkaa	Yes.

In reality, one doesn't equal the other.  Child abuse is wrong, but I see no reason why polygamy should be painted with the same brush.|`|s1zitZMOaa	I really don't see how.

I honestly don't know that I would mind if my husband wanted to take on an extra wife. As long as she was going to do her share of cooking and cleaning that would suit me just fine. Just as long as she wore the same size as me so we could share clothes. Sounds awesome. Me having extra help around the house is misogynistic but the bible - a book that specifically tells people that a woman is to subject herself to her husband, be silent, never have authority, and that men who leave their wives and children will be especially rewarded - that book isn't misogynistic at all!|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	Let's say there's not, for the sake of argument.<br>  <br>  Consenting adults get to do what they want.<br>  <br>  But the key words are "consenting" and "adults."

My parents sold our house in Iowa and bought a resort in Northern MN.  It came with an outhouse.<br>  Then we went back to Iowa for the winter and they rented a tenants house on a farm.  Again, an outhouse.<br>  Both, of course, we had a chamber pot.<br>  <br>  My mother was so unhappy.  I was in love, first a log cabin in the woods, then a farm.|`|1NO10YfPaa	When I was a young girl we lived on a mini farm of sorts; and when we were out too far from the house, we used the outhouse.<br>  <br>  Also used to go to family reunions at an old church in Baker County, Florida and they had an outhouse.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/northsider/gone.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.fortunecity.com/northside...</a>|`|acaJSqW6aa	Have I use it!<br>  Early in my life it was the only toilet at home.<br>  And at night, the flashlight used to find your way made the shadows caused by the grass to look like snakes along the way.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	I do very well, it was at my Grandmother's house in a small Georgia town. You also got an operator when you picked up the phone and you just told her who you wanted to talk to.|`|O9FojdEMaa	oh yes we had an outhouse a two holer that my dad and i built. we didn't use chamber pots or thunder mugs as they were affectionately known. we had a kerosene lantern if you had to go at night.|`|ac825b3aff0d9322a9befa72bcf651f6aa	Yes. all the old terraced houses had outside toilets,quaintly know as the 'petty' or 'lavy' We left a little paraffin lamp lit in winter nights,hoping to stop pipes freezing.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	Yes, and continue to use them when they are available.|`|59Wg2cI3aa	Quite often ~ indoor plumbing wasn't that common in the rural neck of the woods that I grew up in.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	We had an outdoor privy until I was six.

They were in the process of installing indoor plumbing, but didn’t have it completely finished so if you had to go, it was in the outhouse. I hated the outhouse because it smelled so bad and it was full of flies and the most terrible creature in the world: Spiders!<br>  <br>  At night you used a beat up old metal bucket. It was for tinkling only.  <br>  One particular night I woke up, still half asleep I used the bucket to tinkle. No big deal. Except I didn’t quite make it into the bucket, but I peed on the blankets; then the pee ran down into my step-sister’s shoe. <br>  <br>  That was terrible. She got so mad at me. Everyone else just laughed. She told me the next time I had to go I had to go outside and use the shiter.  Good for me we didn’t spend another night. I dreaded having to use that outhouse at night in the dark.|`|ko2Gqkd0aa	I was raised in a house without a bathroom.  Daddy built a little brown outhouse in the back yard that we used until the mid 60's.  We used a chamber pot at night or if the weather was bad and emptied it every morning, ugh. The inside was washed down with bleach and water often, especially if we were expecting company.  One of my fondest memories was when my Aunt Emily came for the first time.  Mother ask me to walk her out back so she could use the facilities.  The whole time she was in there she sang the song about the little brown building out back.|`|J2SK6YxUaa	we still do!yes,we have indoor plumbing in the 1830's farmhouse we inherited,but i like the old outhouse and use it if someone else is taking too long indoors!we all use it on occasion.the house is from the 1830's,the outdoor loo was replaced many times since then,latest put up in 1988.about due to be rebuilt again,we also have chamber pots in our 8 bedrooms,and use them rather than go all the way down the long narrow stairway at night.visiting us is like visiting the waltons,or earlier!the ultimate in "retro."we are only 48 and 55,sounds like we would be  110 ,with the outhouse and all!|`|F3nlVXJ5aa	sure, my grandparents house had one at the end of the sidewalk.  And my aunt and uncle's house had one too.  The t-paper was always damp and musty smelling and you got to choose the size hole you felt would fit you, and you always had to go during the night so a bedpan sufficed.  I disliked running to the outhouse during the wintertime and thru the snow.|`|e9jXrqfdaa	oh yes, and I'm not even 40 ..yet!   It used to be a common feature of British terraced housing along with allotments and there where still some houses with outside loo's in the early 80's in Britain, the last houses  to be modernised inside and out  and then sold off for a small fortune.|`|yS5uy9NBaa	When I was a kid and we would visit relatives in the "country,"   Also back in the 60's when we drove up to Slave Lake and stopped at some camp grounds.  It was mosquito season and I remember laughing at my girlfriend in the outhouse going ow ow ow when the bugs were biting her!!!|`|dL2k6hORaa	When we visit family in south Honduras they don't even have that we go into the corn field. Not much to hold onto. The whole family goes together across to the creek and everyone baths together. Things that you never wanted to see.|`|fc61095727fe8a17ac058f0c1b8e3bf2aa	Other than the popular porta potties at big outdoor events, we did have a club house on a river that had an outhouse. It wasnt my favorite place but it was very clean and didnt smell. My kids called it the "country potty".|`|4fHLDG6Vaa	Gosh! I'm only 53 but raised my daughter a couple miles off the road in Trapper creek AK. She didn't get her first flushing toilet until she was 9!!! So it;s not just the senior citizens...it's just good, simple living!|`|e9GHgtc4aa	at some of the lumber cams I worked at the outhouse was a ten foot shed with six seats . in the morning there was a stampede to get in and out when it was-30 f.|`|hallarIxaa	Yes in the late 1930s we spent summers in a cabin in the woods and had a well seasoned  outhouse.

The Spirit of Christ is put within a person without that person thinking, saying, or doing anything to "get" it.  The Spirit of Christ is added to a person at the time and place of GOD's choosing.  Those who are not children of GOD can not hear the truth as it is in Christ, and therefore are not able to understand, nor can they see or perceive the Spiritual truth of Christ because their senses are dulled Spiritually in order for them NOT to be converted and their sins forgiven, that is, their eyes have been blinded Spiritually, and hearts have been harded Spiritually, and it is so due to the workings of Almighty GOD in that He will not convert nor heal them.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

vSlG3ayiaa	No, but some of the arguments for same sex marriage do lead there.  For example.<br>  <br>  1.  Anybody who loves somebody ought to be allowed to married.<br>  2.  Jim and  Dan love each other.<br>  3.  Therefore, Jim and Dan ought to be allowed to marry.<br>  <br>  But if you take the first premise to its logical conclusion, it can lead to polygamy.<br>  <br>  1.  Anybody who loves somebody ought to be allowed to married.<br>  2.  Jim, Dan, Bob, Sue, Jan, and April love each other.<br>  3.  Therefore, Jim, Dan, Bob, Sue, Jan, and April ought to be allowed to marry each other.<br>  <br>  Here's another one:<br>  <br>  1.  Marriage can be defined any way we want.<br>  2.  We want to define marriage as not only a union between a man and a woman, but also a man and a man or a woman and a woman.<br>  3.  Therefore, we can define marriage as a union between a man and a man or a woman and a woman.<br>  <br>  But again, the first premise, when taken to its logical conclusion can justify marriage between a man and his bookshelf.<br>  <br>  1.

I think it's very much realistic to worry about or at least acknowledge things you have no control over.  I don't know what your culture, but in US culture, we are browbeaten with ideas about one's life being totally determined by one's own efforts and actions.  Of course, any realistic peron can see that such ideas are delusional.  For example, if you work hard at a job for 10 years and your company starts laying people off because of upper management's bad investments, that has nothing to do with your effort but you are negatively effected by factors beyong your control.  I wouldn't call you unhealthy if you worried about your job security.  If your parents are drug addicts, would it be unhealthy for you to worry about them overdosing or getting arrested?  I think not.  Anyone who is reasonably intelligent and not completely self-absorbed worries about things beyond their control.

Though many non-believers claim there is not evidence supporting the existence of a higher power, there is entirely no evidence against him. These believers feel opinionated that one can strongly doubt and disbelieve in a higher power's existence, but they disagree that one can be for certain that there is no higher power. <br>  <br>  They feel that personal experiences and encounters (not merely the Bible) can leave one assured of a higher existence, but in the case of disbelief no one can ever truly prove that there is nothing beyond what is seen.<br>   <br>  :] this was fun... you made me think... thanks|`|f3byX86eaa	I like crystals answer.

Second, the Bible doesn't say it's a sin to be homosexual, it only says it unacceptable for men to engage in homosexual activity.  If you don't act on it you should be fine, and a woman is only required to marry, have kids, and not have sex with men other than her husband, the question of lesbian activity is never discussed.  Don't forget that marriage was originally just legal contract for regulating property disposition, including women, and faithfulness was primarily to ensure that a man's heirs were his own children.  For woman to have sex with a woman didn't pose that risk so it wasn't an issue.|`|TLOgBy3caa	Now, don't get me wrong. I believe in God and I love God, but I also love women.

Vanity is the antithesis of humility which is a virtue. Vanity is NOT a virtue it is a conceit. It distracts a person from what should be the real goal, becoming a humble person, therefore open to change and growth and love and acceptance of others precisely because of that humility. In other words, the humble person recognizes their own imperfections first (instead of vanity-recognizing their own 'talents' for want of a better term) and therefore is more loving and understanding and accepting of others' imperfections. THAT is a BETTER person not one who aggrandizes themselves to themselves and everyone around.<br>  The only time vanity is an asset is for those who perform before the public and that is for several reasons: One must have enough confidence (vanity) to appear before people at all; one must have enough vanity to deal with any and all criticism in a productive way; one must possess enough vanity to continue on with performing by possessing a drive to do so, vanity in another sense.|`|Jg6lfj6saa	I think vanity is self-absorption, and not good for interpersonal relationships.<br>   But>>><br>  I love to drive.

Major difference between Islam and most other religions<br>  <br>  All religions basically exhort mankind to be righteous and eschew evil. But Islam goes beyond that. It guides us towards practical ways of achieving righteousness and eliminating evil from our individual and collective lives. Islam takes into account human nature and the complexities of human society. Islam is guidance from the Creator Himself. Therefore, Islam is also called the Deen-ul-Fitrah (the natural religion of Man).<br>  <br>  <br>  2.   Example - Islam commands us to shun robbery and also prescribes method of eleminating robbery<br>  <br>     1.<br>  <br>        Islam prescribes method of eliminating robbery<br>        All major religions teach that theft is an evil act. Islam teaches the same. So what is the difference between Islam and the other religions? The difference lies in the fact that Islam, besides teaching that robbing is evil, shows a practical way of creating a social structure in which people will not rob.<br>     2.<br>  <br>        Islam prescribes Zakaat<br>        Islam prescribes a system of Zakaat (obligatory annual charity). Islamic law prescribes that every person who has a saving that exceeds the nisaab level i.e. more than 85 grams of gold, should give 2.5% of that saving every lunar year in charity. If every rich person in the world gave Zakaat sincerely, poverty will be eradicated from this world. Not a single human being would die of hunger.<br>     3.<br>  <br>        Chopping off the hands as punishment for robbery<br>        Islam prescribes chopping off the hands of the convicted robber. The Glorious Qur’an says in Surah Maidah:<br>        "As to the thief, male or female, cut off his or her hands:a punishment by way<br>        of example, from Allah, for their crime: and Allah is Exalted in power, full of wisdom."<br>                                  [ Al-Qur’an 5:38]<br>        The non-Muslim may say, "Chopping off the hands in this 20th century. Islam is a barbaric and ruthless religion!"<br>     4.<br>  <br>        Results achieved when Islamic Shariah Implemented<br>        America is supposed to be one of the most advanced countries in the world. Unfortunately it also has one of the highest rates of crime, theft, and robbery. Suppose the Islamic shariah is implemented in America i.e. every rich person gives Zakaat ( 2.5% of his savings in charity above 85 grams of gold every lunar year), and every convicted robber has his or her hands chopped off as a punishment. Will the rate of theft and robbery in America increase, remain same or decrease? Naturally it will decrease. Moreover the existence of such a stringent law would discourage many a potential robber.<br>  <br>        I agree that the amount of theft that takes place in the world today is so tremendous that if you chop off the hands of all the thieves, there will be tens of thousands of people whose hands will be chopped off. The point here is that the moment you implement this law the rate of theft will decline immediately. The potential robber would give it a serious thought before jeopardizing his limbs. The mere thought of the punishment itself will discourage majority of the robbers. There will barely be a few who would rob. Hence only a few person’s hands would be chopped off but millions would live peacefully without fear of being robbed.<br>  <br>        Islamic Shariah is therefore practical, and achieves results.<br>  <br>  <br>  3.   Example: Islam prohibits the molestation and rape of women. It enjoins hijaab and prescribes capital punishment for a convicted rapist.<br>  <br>     1. Islam prescribes method of eliminating molestation and rape<br>        All the major religions declare the molestation and rape of women as grave sins. Islam teaches the same. What then is the difference between Islam and the other religions? The difference lies in the fact that Islam does not merely preach respect for women, or abhor molestation and rape as serious crimes, but also gives clear guidance as to how society can eliminate such crimes.<br>  <br>  <br>     2. Hijaab for men<br>        Islam has a system of hijaab. The Glorious Qur’an first mentions hijaab for the men and then for the women. Hijaab for the men is mentioned in the following verse:<br>  <br>        "Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty: that will make for greater purity for them: and Allah is well acquainted with all that they do."<br>                                [Al-Qur’an 24:30]<br>  <br>        The moment a man looks at a woman and if any brazen or unashamed thought comes to his mind, he should lower his gaze.<br>     3. Hijaab for women<br>        Hijaab for women is mentioned in the following verse:<br>  <br>        "And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; that they should draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands’ fathers, their sons...."<br>  <br>                                  [Al-Qur’|`|AA12155794	Sure,if religion is followed religiously there will be a change.But it should be followed by all sects,no imposition of religion on others.All should be allowed to follow their respective belief in their own way.<br>  Religion means tolerance,love and accommodation of others.If so, no problem.There must be a change.|`|c8828614b563cd3de41253b6a9e40991aa	"Religion" means the rites and ceremonies attached to any given belief system.

We are simply here to control and lead our own lives into the highest state of well-being that we can possibly achieve. When we are connected to this inspiring feel-good feeling of inner-being we will naturally offer and channel balance through our engagement with the physical world.<br>  <br>  Change insinuates controlling external conditions that exist outside of our sphere of control, One will never find highest levels of contentment in trying to manipulate the chosen systems, behaviour or beliefs of others. We should only be concerned about what thoughts and emotional states we are employing in relation to the evolutional natural flowing current of our internal nature. If we are fully connected to the core essence of our inner-being, we will be in an empowered position to transmit a balanced execution of love imbued actions, which will naturally influence and positively effect the nature of those who share our moment of space - and these ripples will spread.  Religion has been trying for centuries, and although they make positive changes to people lives it never seems to be enough.<br>  <br>   Religion alone clearly does not have the power to entirely transform the collective mind into willing submission to it's rules and conditions, which are viewed by many as limiting the indivduals right to self-power source power, which is the energy that is woven through absolutely everything. It is the force that holds every other force in place. This energy is given many names and many personalities, But it simply is a flow of eternal creative energy.

XN0cYCATaa	The teaching that there is an eternal hell in which hordes of mankind will suffer eternal punishment can be a difficult doctrine to accept.  We hear so much about God's infinite love and how He desires that all men be saved (1 Tim. 2:4).  However, those who develop their theologies based upon the "gentle" side of God do so with an incomplete picture.  Not only is God loving (1 John 4:8-10), gracious (Exo. 33:19; 1 Pet. 2:3), and merciful (Exodus 34:6; Psalm 67:1; James 5:11), but He is also holy (Isaiah 6:3; Rev. 4:8), just ( Neh. 9:32-33; 2 Thess. 1:6), and hates sin (Psalm 5:5-6; Hab. 1:13).  God punishes the sinner (Jer. 50:31; Ez. 44:12; Matt. 25:46; 2 Thess. 1:9; 2 Pet. 2:9; Heb. 10:29).|`|AA11124121	Sheol (pronounced "Sheh-ole")[1], in Hebrew ???? (Sh'ol), is the "abode of the dead", the "underworld", or "pit".[2] Sheol is the common destination of both the righteous and the unrighteous dead, as recounted in Ecclesiastes and Job.|`|ttCkz39aaa	It's neither once you are dead|`|Xt9wIj4Iaa	The KJV was inconsistant, sometimes translating sheol and hades as "grave," "pit," or "hell."<br>  <br>  The Hebrew word sheol means grave. Not individual graves, but the grave in the common, all-encompassing meaning, such as "we are all headed to the grave." The Greek word hades was the Greek equivalent for sheol.<br>  <br>  Another problem is that the KJV version translated two completely different words as "hell." They translated "gehenna" as hell, which was a burning garbage heap outside of Jerusalem. And they translated "tartarus" as hell, which was a deep, dark place reserved for spirit-creatures only (not dead humans) in ancient Greek mythology.<br>  <br>  This shows the importance of getting an modern, accurate translation of the  bible. It also shows that sometimes reading the bible alone is not enough - one must do study and research to get a fuller understanding of scriptures.|`|jV99kgWbaa	The words "grave" and "hell" are both mentioned in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Both are acknowledged, and one doesn't cancel out the other.<br>  <br>  So, you're right to think there are some occasions when the Bible is talking about the grave and natural bodily death, and other occasions where it is talking about an eternal place where we are forever conscious of being separated from God, as the rich man was in Luke, and as those not written in the Book of Life are in Revelation.|`|AA10747442	Grave in a few cases in the OT !!!

Which countries are we talking about?|`|JOankL0eaa	Religious countries, lets say like Brazil, have a high crime rate because of other issues(such as poverty), it's not because the majority of people are theists. Countries that have a high percentage of atheists tend to be the more affluent countries where people that are poor receive aid from the Government.  <br>  <br>  consider other factors. it's not about being a theist/atheist..crime rates are about other issues such as social and economic inequality.<br>  <br>  Being an atheist is a privilege; if you were very, very poor, you would be a theist right now.|`|tbESsT2daa	Religions throughout history have been phased out. First the polytheistic religions went out the window (Greek mythology about Zeus + mountain of gods), and in came monotheism.<br>  <br>  Monotheism too will be phased out, because its just one more god to subtract until we have zero! Yay! :D<br>  <br>  As humanity becomes more advanced technologically, and scientifically religious doctrine will no longer serve as "true word" of any kind, since most stories are already disproven. In most industrialized western countries secularism is very popular (Britain, France). America is an example of this, but of course they're all hillbilly's. Along with less intelligent + more brainwashed religious believers (Muslims in the Middle East) it will take a longer transition for them to become secular.<br>  <br>  In time though, morality and code of ethics will no longer be only attributed to religious belief :)|`|bfQGXi9zaa	You have created a false premise, i.e., religion is primary causative agent in a nation's crime rate.  There are certain facts you don't take into account, like:<br>  -Countries like the U.S. have a substantially higher population than countries like Norway and Sweden, so undoubtedly the crime rate would be higher.<br>  -Even countries that have high per capita atheist outlook still have religious groups among them...yet the crime rate stays consistent...so is religion even a cause?<br>  <br>  What you really need is show, objectively, that religion actually induces or is a causative agent of crime.  Until you do, it is simply post hoc thinking.  The relationship must be shown to be definitive, not speculative.|`|33ThRhRhaa	"Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!

Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine, and valiant men in mixing strong drink, who acquit the guilty for a bribe, and deprive the innocent of his right! Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root will be as rottenness, and their blossom go up like dust; for they have rejected the law of the Lord of hosts, and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel."

His personality is pretty much every girls fantasy,(He is more than perfect) and their idea of a perfect boyfriend better than they could have thought of themselves,  hence, girls love the movie because they love the book because they love Edward.|`|iD39dv9eaa	Because now adays its cool to be gay, and twilight is really gay.|`|O4qO8aoLaa	I dunno.

SHtTPBieaa	I recently attended a Universalism Church.  It was an interesting experience and I may have found a permanent place to go commune with like minded people.  They are at once a religion by itself and the tolerance of all religions.  I think the minister is a Pagan, at least she speaks like a Pagan.  I met several Atheist and had a long conversation with a Gnostic and a Jewish Cabalist after the service.  I thought it was great, but it was my only experience with them so far.  I plan to attend regularly for awhile at least to find out more.|`|oeO8Tgroaa	I have never met a better way to learn anything than to take them all together and learn them all at the same time.

The end of the series did not feel like an end. It was the most disappointing finale I've ever seen. The majority of the conflicts were not resolved.

Apparently Tina had a 3 year lesbian relationship with her sister.

Actually I started getting sick of it after season 3. I mean comon, how many women can one girl possibly sleep with over the course of their life?  Oh wait it happened in just a few years! It kind of puts lesbians to shame. I mean really, were not really that crazy and shallow, and definantly not crazy sex demons. I mean that show makes it seem like lesbians are going to come out of the walls and rape you! That being said however, it was nice to find a show that I could relate too on some level about being constantly hazed in society. Kind of puts your worst fears in prospective. And of course seeing Katherine Moenning was deinfnatly a plus. She's definantly sexy. <br>  Season 5 made a serious comeback for me. The relationships seemed to settle a bit and they werent as crazy sex preditors as they had been. <br>  But then season 6 happened. Don't get me wrong the season itself was entertaining but the last episode ..  I could have been doing something productive in that time. Let's just say that. In fact I wouldent have been suprised to see a giant middle finger with a $ bling ring come after the final credits. <br>  <br>  The only saving grace I see in this is that there is talk of a new show about Alice in prison for jenny's murder. That, it is said, is the reason behind not disclosing the culprit. Personally I think jennys a nut and committed suicide in the most selfish way possible while letting her friends take the blame. Oh jenny, how I hate you and your psycho obsessiveness. I liked her in season 1 though, for a few episodes. I mean really Marina was a vixen godess. I really don't blame her for diving down those waters.|`|6w7FKrlfaa	i'm in australia.. and i don't even think it's airing here...  geeees the last episode i saw was when jenny was making that stupid film...  now i read like who kidded jenny??  i was like wtf?  but yeah  i loved qaf more anyways...  gotta love brian and justin...|`|UyDkYaXuaa	I like it.

j9OUIki3aa	That is even true of my closest friends and family.  When people do that, it is a sign of insecurity.  They want to prove that they are valid.  <br>  <br>  When it happens to me, I see it was a warning that the person I am talking to needs major reinforcement.  The only reason they are questioning you, usually, is because they are insecure.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to try to understand why they are insecure.  Sometimes it is a child, and in that case, of course you try to help.  Other times, it is a malicious co-worker, and then you just use the info as info.  <br>  <br>  It all depend- but always, I agree with that statement|`|uhc1MCDzaa	I wouldn't say spiritually speaking has a connection to the occurrence of which you speak. If you are asking about it literally I know that pharmacies of old were raised, and teachers usually had a much higher chair than students. Judges sit high in a court room etc. This may be a psychological way of reminding others of the power each title has over the general public.<br>  Lets not forget that preachers always stand on a higher platform bu then its easier for his/her congregation to see him/her I guess.<br>  Emotionally if you are speaking of ppl looking down on others, perhaps; but I more think it is the one looking down is in protection from seeing his/her own flaws. If someone looks down on me, I have to wonder of their own fragile, self esteem. I look even on with most everyone unless someones behavior is so repulsive and vile I have a moment of feeling superior and  then I give them the benefit of doubt. Like; they must be really mentally sick.|`|3RGqsE7Qaa	I don't understand what you mean "spiritually speaking."<br>  <br>  Like does it move me like my faith does?<br>  <br>  Do you mean something like personally speaking?<br>  <br>  Personally speaking, I find this statement has the ring of truth.  I do often observe that some people will treat others badly in an attempt to make themselves look better.  It could be anything from a aura of superiority around someone, to kids making fun of the new guy to make themselves seem cool or in the "in" crowd.|`|b0qKOoBRaa	Spiritually speaking?  Well, I definitely agree that some people use this method to try to get respect, and SOME people fall for it.  There are certainly many others who don't participate in this sort of behavior.

Sorry.|`|5ee96c3ba7c06cccc98ec737be0f8ffdaa	In the sense that people attempt to increase their perceived superiority in whatever field is at subject, then yes.

By doing this, they will feel better about themselves and make you feel less about yourselves.<br>  <br>  Some people just like to see people fall.<br>  <br>  Everyone feels like they are number 1 with something that they are good at and when someone comes along and beats them, they prefer this not be so.<br>  <br>  Just keep your head up.|`|uJ7iZ0L1aa	As far as spirituality is concerned, This is just a man's(who thinks in an ordinary way) appraoch and attitude towards other souls..

2zYCQX9saa	Good Question.<br>  The passage to which you refer is just one proof (a very good one) that God is the saviour of ALL men. <br>  <br>  Jesus preached the gospel to those men who were already dead because of their sins. They accepted Jesus and now they are alive to God in Spirit! Physical death is not an impediment to salvation. Jesus is Lord of both the living and the dead.<br>  <br>  God is no respecter of persons and will do that for all men.<br>  <br>  The wages of sin is DEATH. Period. Do not add anything to it. The wages of sin is not 'going to hell and burning in unspeakable torture for eternity without any hope from a loving father God'<br>  <br>  Those men died in their sins. They paid the price for their own condition. Jesus preached the gospel and brought life to those men.<br>  <br>  "But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:"<br>  (II Timothy 1:10)<br>  <br>  Glory! "God is the Saviour of ALL men..!" 1Tim.2:3-6; 4:10|`|8YqXuhRsaa	Ok my friend this need not get heated hear my tone from my opening statement, this is not to offend but is my opinion and belief of what the bible says.<br>  Now when the bible refers to dead it refers to two things dead in the spirit (Colossians 2:13 read from beginning for context) and dead as in no longer living on the mortal plane. When this 1 Peter 4:5-6 is in context likewise to that of Colossians  the sixth verse saying "For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit." <br>  Firstly the dead is referring to the dead in sins again, the living in accordance with the spirit here signifies several things firstly that the law had been fufilled thus man could walk in the spirit (Galatians 5:16), which also links with the previous verses which talk of the death of Christ and the benefits as a result of his sacrifice. It also is a play on the second verse which explains that Christ suffered for a time on earth then resurrected unto the father. In the same way we were sinners then we became saints. The 'flesh' is not referring to physicality, but rather the sinfulness of carnality. Otherwise the statement reads "For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead (not living), that they might be judged according to men in the flesh (physical), but live according to God in the spirit (invisible - metaphysical)." Which is a total break of subject considering the previous five verses,  <br>  <br>   1Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;<br>  <br>   2That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.<br>  <br>   3For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:<br>  <br>   4Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:<br>  <br>   5Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead. <br>  <br>  The who (in verse five) is not refering to the dead, but it is referring to the people spoken of in verse four. Then your understanding states that it then moves on to say.<br>  <br>  For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead (physical), that they might be judged according to men in the flesh (physical), but live according to God in the spirit (invisible - metaphysical).<br>  <br>  For the reason of the previous verses was the gospel preached unto the dead, is not congruent with previous verses.<br>  This is..... that for the reason that those who sin have to give an account to God, God was preached unto them that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live accoriding to God in the spirit.<br>  <br>  Oh and to move on to your point about being fair God is fair but not to our standards. God is fair in that if you do what he says the reward will always be there you will always reap what you sew. The idea that God will even out the time you are born into is incorrect. God did not even it out for those born in world wars neither did he do so for slaves etc. These times come and we are to endure them as we need to. God is a righteous God. Further than that he did not do it for the Jews who struggled to follow the law.|`|0vmQNf0oaa	No, that is not so. We know that the dead in Christ are in relationship with God. We just see no Biblical justification for asking them to pray for us.<br>  <br>  The gospel was preached to the righteous dead in Abraham's bosom. Prior to the resurrection of Christ believers went there instead of directly into the presence of God.<br>  <br>  The good new was preached to the righteous dead that the promised Messiah had now come and died for our sins as the prophets had proclaimed would happen. It was not a message to save them but the good news that their redemption had been accomplished.<br>  <br>  There is NO SECOND CHANCE.<br>  <br>  Heb 9:27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:|`|oyvLCy5Caa	Scripture does not support that theory.  One a person is dead they are judged and there is no second chance.  <br>  Spurgeon said:<br>  I suppose the meaning is that the gospel was preached to those departed saints who had been called to die for Christ’s sake, and that it was preached to them for this very reason, that, while they were judged by wicked men, and were by them condemned to die, they still live a far more glorious life than they lived here, because they were thus enabled, by their martyr death, to consummate their consecration to God.<br>  <br>  You must read the entire context of this passage not pick out one scripture to make a dogmatic claim.  <br>  <br>  1 Peter 4:1 Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, 2 so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God. 3 For the time that is past suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry. 4 With respect to this they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery, and they malign you; 5 but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. 6 For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.<br>  <br>  Here we read of people who are obviously dead in their sins and trespasses.  These people are not saved or born again.  They are dead (See Ephesians 2).  God will one day judge the living (born again) and the dead (spiritually dead).  Gospel preached to the dead is referring to those who have been judged in the flesh by lost people, those who are enemies of God and were probably martyred.  You posted Rev. 20:4 which supports this, the beheaded are martyrs.  <br>  <br>  Catholics pray for the dead because they believe a false doctrine of purgatory.  That is no where in scripture.  We cannot pray anyone out of their eternity in hell.  There is no waiting area, there is only Hebrews 9:27.  <br>  To suggest that people would have been saved if the gospel was preached to them is false.  All men have the knowledge of God (Romans 1) but they supress the truth because of their sin or because they choose to follow false gods.  A Christian who dies will always be a child of God and part of the church (body of believers, bride of Christ).  Those who die in sin go to hell, period.  That is why we are told Today is the day of salvation.  Our life is but a vapor, come to Christ NOW!

You're taking the literal narrative of the world, that was put in place by God to reveal the spiritual truths(spiritual narrative) to makind, too literally.<br>  <br>  Yes, literally, light does help us see.  That's a literal fact.  But that literal fact was put there for a reason: To reveal the spiritual facts.<br>  <br>  With your argument, you could also say that God is water:  The Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters, where there is water there is life, all life comes from God, God is everywhere, etc.  <br>  Your literal argument would make it logically possible that God is water.  But spiritual truth from the literal narrative of water=life is discovered by God's revelation: Baptism.  The Hebrews were Baptized into a new life when saved by Moses from the parting of the sea.  And Jesus instituted Baptism so everyone could be reborn into a new life.  The literal narrative of water=life, combined with revelation from God, reveals the spiritual truths from literal truths around us.<br>  <br>  In other words, Jesus isn't the sun, and God isn't water.|`|mSJmowzDaa	So I ask you "what gives light to the earth".

If a man has more than one wife, the parents of the children born of such marriages can easily be identified. The father as well as the mother can easily be identified. In case of a woman marrying more than one husband, only the mother of the children born of such marriages will be identified and not the father. Islam gives tremendous importance to the identification of both parents, mother and father. Psychologists tell us that children who do not know their parents, especially their father undergo severe mental trauma and disturbances. Often they have an unhappy childhood. It is for this reason that the children of prostitutes do not have a healthy childhood. If a child born of such wedlock is admitted in school, and when the mother is asked the name of the father, she would have to give two or more names! I am aware that recent advances in science have made it possible for both the mother and father to be identified with the help of genetic testing. Thus this point which was applicable for the past may not be applicable for the present.<br>  <br>  <br>  2.   Man is more polygamous by nature as compared to a woman.<br>  <br>  <br>  3.   Biologically, it is easier for a man to perform his duties as a husband despite having several wives. A woman, in a similar position, having several husbands, will not find it possible to perform her duties as a wife. A woman undergoes several psychological and behavioral changes due to different phases of the menstrual cycle.<br>  <br>  <br>  4.   A woman who has more than one husband will have several sexual partners at the same time and has a high chance of acquiring venereal or sexually transmitted diseases which can also be transmitted back to her husband even if all of them have no extra-marital sex. This is not the case in a man having more than one wife, and none of them having extra-marital sex.<br>  <br>  <br>  The above reasons are those that one can easily identify. There are probably many more reasons why Allah, in His Infinite Wisdom, has prohibited polyandry.
qky7gWosaa	If a man divorces his wife, they continue to live together (but cannot be intimate) for three months (longer if she is pregnant or nursing an infant). If they reconcile during that time, the marriage continues as before. There is no need to remarry.<br>  <br>  If the divorce becomes final and they separate, they have the option of remarrying later. However, if the husband has divorced his wife three times, he no longer has the option of taking her back. The only way he can get her back is if she happens to marry someone else and that marriage later happens to end.|`|89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	Dear Belle salam for you.No it is not easy for a muslim man to get divorce because there are some requirements for that.Besides that Al<br>  lah says in the Qur'an that Allah hates divorce although it is halal or allowed. Muslim husband if he will divorce his wife he should have a strong reason.If his wife has no mistakes he could not ger divorce.If it is looked as easy it maybe its practice is not in line with the Qur'an.<br>  A husband could only remarried with his ex wife just only twice,the third talaq(divorce) the ex wife should get married with another man in real marriage.It means as the challenge or as barricade for the husband that he should not act easily to divorce his wife..In Indonesia we have the marriage law which limitation to husband to divorce his wife such she made bad doing (adultery),has unfertile womb,long illness.The wife has also the right to divorce her husband as stated in the Qur'an which is called khulu right if her husband made bad doings to her such as did not give money for cost of living and did not fulfil his<br>  immaterial  obligation to his wife more than 3 months. or made harrashment to her and she disliked it.<br>  Man and woman in Islam has equility but their function is different.so it is not 100% equal due to the different biological condition..Before getting divorce.husband and wife should go to an advosory marriage council set up by the government where they will be suggested to be peace and get unity again by reconciliation the reason why they want to get divorce.At least they will give time for it during 3 weeks.In the process they should have strong reasons and several witnesses for its reasons.|`|UutLVO2Laa	Islam is a man's world. A religion 'invented' by a man.|`|SCkhQc2Caa	Where is the so called equality of the sexes in this situation?<br>  <br>  - There is no equality of sexes. women are not equal to men.<br>  <br>  Is the moon equal to sun ? orange equal to apple ? darkness equal to lightness ?<br>  _________________________________<br>  <br>   Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: <br>  <br>  “Here we should note that there are some people who speak of equality instead of justice, and this is a mistake. We should not say equality, because equality implies no differentiation between the two. Because of this unjust call for equality, they started to ask, what is the difference between male and female?’ So they made males and females the same, and then the communists said, ‘What difference is there between ruler and subject? No one has any authority over anyone else, not even fathers and sons; the father has no authority over his son,’ and so on. <br>  <br>  But if we say justice, which means giving each one that to which he or she is entitled, this misunderstanding no longer applies, and the word used is correct. Hence it does not say in the Qur’aan that Allaah enjoins equality, rather it says (interpretation of the meaning):<br>  <br>   “Verily, Allaah enjoins Al?‘Adl (i.e. justice)”<br>  <br>  [al-Nahl 16:90] <br>  <br>  “and that when you judge between men, you judge with justice”<br>  <br>  [al-Nisa’ 4:58] <br>  <br>  Those who say that Islaam is the religion of equality are lying against Islaam. Rather Islaam is the religion of justice which means treating equally those who are equal and differentiating between those who are different. <br>  <br>  No one who knows the religion of Islaam would say that it is the religion of equality.  Rather what shows you that this principle is false is the fact that most of what is mentioned in the Qur’aan denies equality, as in the following verses: <br>  <br>  ‘Say: Are those who know equal to those who know not?”<br>  [al-Zumar 39:9] <br>  <br>  ‘Say: Is the blind equal to the one who sees? Or darkness equal to light?’<br>  [al-Ra’d 13:16] <br>  <br>  ‘Not equal among you are those who spent and fought before the conquering (of Makkah, with those among you who did so later’<br>  [al-Hadeed 57:10] <br>  <br>  ‘Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allaah with their wealth and their live’<br>  [al-Nisa’ 4:95] <br>  <br>  Not one single letter in the Qur’aan enjoins equality, rather it enjoins justice. You will also find that the word justice is acceptable to people, for I feel that if I am better than this man in terms of knowledge, or wealth, or piety, or in doing good, I would not like for him to be equal to me. <br>  <br>  Every man knows that he find it unacceptable if we say that the male is equal to the female.” <br>  <br>  [Sharh al-‘Aqeedah al-Waasitah, 1/180-181]<br>  ___________________________________<br>  <br>  Islaam regards men and women as equally obliged with regard to many acts of worship and interactions with others.<br>  Women are like men in some aspects and they differ from them in others. Most of the rulings of Islaam apply to men and women equally.<br>  <br>   In cases where a distinction is made between the sexes, the Muslim regards that as a mercy from Allaah and a sign of His knowledge of His creation, but the arrogant kaafir sees it as oppression and injustice, so he stubbornly insists on claiming that men and women are the same. <br>  <br>  So let him tell us how a man can carry a foetus and breastfeed it?  He stubbornly ignores the weakness of women and how they bleed during their monthly period, and he stubbornly beat his head against the rock of reality. <br>  <br>  But the Muslim is still at peace with his faith, surrendering to the command of Allaah. <br>  <br>  “Should not He Who has created know? And He is the Most Kind and Courteous (to His slaves), All?Aware (of everything)”<br>  <br>  [al-Mulk 67:14 – interpretation of the meaning] <br>  ___________________________________<br>  <br>  Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<br>  <br>   “… When you divorce  women, divorce them at their ‘iddah (prescribed periods)…” [al-Talaaq 65:1]<br>  <br>  - If a Muslim wants to divorce his wife, he should divorce her according to the Sunnah, which is to give one talaaq at a time when his wife is taahir (not menstruating) and he has not yet had intercourse with her following her period, or when it is clear that she is pregnant.<br>  <br>   - If she has custody of her children from him, then in that case he must also give her: <br>  <br>  (iii)   Payment for custody and breastfeeding.<br>  (iv)   Maintenance for the children.<br>  <br>  Evidence : [al-Baqarah 2:233]. <br>  <br>  - If she is pregnant he should spend on her. <br>  <br>   “And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they lay down their burden”<br>  <br>  [al-Talaaq 65:6].<br>  ______________________________<br>  <br>  The reason why divorce is in the man’s hands, and the ruling on divorce for no reason : <a href="http://islamqa.com/en/ref/111881" rel="nofollow">http://islamqa.com/en/ref/111881</a><br>  ______________________________|`|80piiicYaa	first of all ur wrong about the talaaq three times....<br>  i will explain the proper muslim divorce<br>  1st talaaq is a simple warning and it is between the husband and wife<br>  2nd talaaq the wife must leave the husband (or vise a versa ) and the only way they get back together is by a shiekh<br>  3rd talaaq is final and they must sepperate by islamic law<br>  the man cant say it 3 times in a row and thats it|`|whkC5077aa	Yes, it looks easy, but it is not as easy as its seems.

ctOge9SLaa	Good kind of question. I truly thank the Lord for leading you to ask it.<br>  Sorry for the length, but I pray that the brothers and sister will prayerfully read. Amen.<br>  <br>  The book of Romans shares many things with us as it relates to the Christian life, it shows us a very valuable key that truly can liberate us in our walk with the Lord.<br>  <br>  Chapter 8:6 shares that as a believer, we can be carnally minded, or have our minds set on the flesh and it is here that we reap death. It also shares that we can be spiritually minded, or set our minds on the spirit, and it is here that our mind is filled with Life and peace.  <br>  <br>  " For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace"<br>  <br>  A carnal believer is one who actually does not take that much care of the Lord's life in him.  We have each received the Lord into our spirits when we believed in Him. Once the Lord has made our spirit His Habitation, He desires to do an inner work in our being.  This work is in our soul, with the mind, as the leading faculty.  Wherever a believer's mind is set, this will result in only two ends, Life or Death.<br>  <br>  Our mind, as the middle man, always has the daily, even moment by moment choice of being set either on our flesh or on our spirit. Whichever part ( flesh or spirit) is stronger will always take the upper hand. Once our mind is SET on either one, this will dictate where our entire being will go and the kind of christian we will be, i.e, Carnal, or Spiritual.<br>  <br>  If we are those taking care of our spirit, to feed in the word day by day, to enjoy calling on the Name of the Lord to drink of the cup of salvation and of the Spirit, taking care of our conscience concerning sin,  of having fellowship with the Lord vertically one on one and horizontally with the saints, then our spirit man will be strong and can take the lead to saturate, arrest, penetrate and strengthen our mind, the result will be that we are filled with Life and peace.  <br>  <br>  The Lord living in our spirit is the Resurrection and the Life. He came that we might have LIFE and have it abundantly ( jn 10:10b). This life is divine, indistructable, eternal, it is overcoming, it is free and it is God Himself, being made available to us as our life and life supply to make it in the christian life.<br>  <br>  On the opposite end of this we have the believer who does not take care of his spirit. Where reading the word is not a part of his normal day, where sins pile up and make his conscience dull and dark, If our conscience is heavy, then this cuts off our sweet fellowship with the Lord, our flesh has the poison of satan in it and desires and lusts after sinful things in the world, be it of the eyes, the  flesh or the pride of life.<br>  If we are those not taking care of our spirit, by default, we are those feeding our flesh.  Whatever we feed, GROWS.<br>  <br>  In the case of a brother or sister who is carnal, it just means that they feed their flesh more than their spirit. As a result, they are more worldly, they "mind" the things of the world. They may fall into temptation easier and even sin more.  This is the goal of satan in each believer. His moto is, " Okay.. get saved.. who cares, but wait, I have another plan, I don't mind you being saved, but hey.. I'll keep you so carnal and weak spiritually, and cause you to lead a defeated christian life, that you will be useless to God, to yourself, to the sharing the gospel because you will have a poor testimony, to others believers and in the end haha , my greatest goal I will gain which  is to prevent the Church as the Body of Christ from being built up..."<br>  <br>  I tell you sister, we truly need to be those taking care of our spirit man.<br>  Paul prayed that we will be strengthened with Power through God's Spirit, into the inner man.  If our spirit is well cared for, then we will have a prevailing kind of christian life.  This is God's goal in our being.  To grow from strength to strength. That each time we turn to our spirit, by calling on the Name of the Lord, thus setting our mind on the spirit, we are those who will be infused with Life and Peace. Our calling on the Lord was not just only to be saved when we first believed, but we want to be like the early Church believers, who called on the Name of the Lord in " every place" and with a pure heart with others.<br>  <br>  1 Cor 1:2<br>  To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with ALL those who CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD Jesus Christ in EVERY PLACE, who is theirs and ours"<br>  <br>  2 Tim 2:22<br>   But flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace WITH THOSE WHO CALL on the Lord out of a pure heart"<br>  <br>  <br>  This is the quickest way to have our minds SET on the spirit.Once we are set, the Lord comes in to strengthen us, to lead us to spend time in the word, to pray, to confess our sins, to be brought back into sweet fellowship where He can dispense more of His rich LIFE to us.<br>  It is here we will be " saved in His Life"<br>  <br>  Rom 5:10<br>  For if we, being enemies were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, MUCH MORE, we WILL BE SAVED in His LIFE, having been reconciled"<br>  <br>  Grace be with all our sisters and brothers who struggle with the flesh. May we all be encouraged to pursue the Lord together.<br>  <br>  We want to be those strong in spirit and walking in the spirit. The Lord desires that we TAP INTO this truth and realize the deliverance that He has afforded us from sin, the self, the flesh, satan, the world. He has overcome ALL for us and desires to overcome them ONCE MORE in and through us.<br>  <br>  Wonderful question<br>  Your sister<br>  sandy|`|NQPlZ4vQaa	someone who says they are a christian and they could be, but loves the things of the world and dosent fret over when they sin. they can go to church every service but some people who go to church will go to hell. the bible says in Matthews 7:21, not everyone who calls me their lord will get into the kingdom of heaven. only the ones who obey my Father in heaven will get in.<br>  <br>  hope this answers ur question|`|uUTmx9ZPaa	Praise The Lord!<br>  <br>  Sister Sandy's response is really wholesome to this question.

In context, this means someone seeking things of the flesh rather than things of the Spirit.  A person too much in love with the tangible world, rather than the world to come.

(15)  For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.  (16)  Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good.  (17)  So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.  (18)  For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out.  (19)  For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.

ljzb6fZBaa	The full armour of God has spiritual meanings because it is meant to be put on during spiritual warfare. To put on the full armour of God is to believe the gospel of grace.<br>  <br>  Belt of truth - This is the first piece of armour because the gospel is synonymous with the truth - "In Him, you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation". (Ephesians 1:13) The gospel declares we are made righteous by faith in Christ, not by works. (Romans 1:17; Romans 4:1-4) The belt is important because it holds the other pieces of armour, such as sword's scabbard and pants, together. It is difficult to fight the enemies when one's belt is loose, with one hand holding the sword and the other hand holding up the pants - the enemies may die laughing.<br>  <br>  Breastplate of righteousness - The breastplate protects our heart. It is important to protect our heart from condemnation because the devil attacks our heart with condemnation. "Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence towards God." (1 John 3:21) The devil is the accuser of the brethren. (Revelations 12:9) Hence, we overcome Satan by the blood of the Lamb, which was shed to forgive all our sins and to make us righteous in God's sight. (Romans 5:9) We need to believe we are still the righteousness of God in Christ, especially when we fail or make mistakes, because the devil will try to make our hearts feel condemned, and cause us to think God is angry with us or rejects us. When we believe we are righteous in Christ, we will also live righteously, for right believing will always lead to right living.<br>  <br>  Gospel of peace - We wear the gospel of peace like shoes, because the Bible says "how beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!" (Romans 10:15) The gospel of peace is another name for the gospel of grace in the new covenant. Paul always opened his epistles to the church by saying "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ". When we share the good news of grace and peace, we are also sharing testimonies of our victory in Christ over sin, sickness, depression, lack and unclean habits. That's how we overcome Satan too. (Revelations 12:11) Wearing the shoes of peace also means we walk in peace. The devil cannot manage a peaceful Christian. He can only tempt or trouble us when we are agitated. Therefore, we need to remain in peace in times of adversity, and trust God to turn things around for our good. (Romans 8:28)<br>  <br>  Shield of faith - This shield is meant to quench all the fiery darts of the spiritual enemies. The fiery darts are thoughts of accusation and doubt that the enemies may put in our minds, making us feel fearful. Therefore, faith is a shield to protect us from fear. We need to believe we are the righteousness of God in Christ. We need to believe all the promises of God are Yes and Amen in Christ to the glory of God through us. (2 Corinthians 1:20) We need to believe we are overcomers and more than conquerors through Christ who loves us. Faith pleases God, and whoever believes in Him will never be put to shame. (Hebrews 11:6; Romans 10:11)<br>  <br>  Helmet of salvation - Paul referred to the helmet as the "hope of salvation" in 1 Thessalonians 5:8. Hope ("elpis") is a positive or confident expectation of good. Salvation ("soteria") includes healing, prosperity and well-being. We have confident expectation of good because Jesus died to save us from every evil. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, that the blessing of Abraham might come on us, which includes health, wholeness and prosperity in every area of our life. (Galatians 3:13-14) We need to be assured of our salvation too. Once we are saved by grace through faith in Christ, we are saved forever because Christ is our new identity. 1 John 4:17 says that "as He is, so are we in this world". This is how we can have boldness in the day of judgment. When God looks at us, He sees us in all the beauties, all the glories, all the moral grandeurs and all the excellencies of our Lord Jesus Christ!<br>  <br>  Sword of the Spirit - The sword is the Word of God. When Jesus was tempted in the wilderness by the devil, He counter-attacked his temptations by quoting relevant verses, "It is written... It is written... It is written..." The devil will get the point, and leave you alone when you quote verses against his temptations. For example, when the devil makes you fearful, you can say under your breath, "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind." (2 Timothy 1:6) You need to speak out God's words, just like what Jesus did. God's words when spoken carry power, and His words will not return to Him void, but will accomplish the purpose for which it was sent. (Isaiah 55:11)<br>  <br>  Finally, prayer. To pray in the Spirit is to pray in tongues. (1 Corinthians 14:14) When you pray in the Spirit, you don't have to engage your mind because you are speaking to God. (1 Corinthians 14:2) This is an advantage because the devil doesn't know what you are praying too. When you pray in tongues, you will always pray according to the will of God. (Romans 8:27) Prayer is a powerful weapon, therefore Paul exhorted us to pray at all times in the Spirit. Praying in tongues also build up yourself, not only giving you revelations of God's words, but also repairing your body, boosting your immune system. (1 Corinthians 14:4)<br>  <br>  It is important to put on the full armour of God before engaging in spiritual warfare because we are not wrestling against flesh and blood, but against spiritual enemies. We cannot fight them with natural weapons like reasoning and logic or psychology or philosophy. We need the gospel of grace as our spiritual weapon. Paul wrote that he was not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation (making us whole in every way) to everyone who believes. (Romans 1:16) When we keep believing and confessing we are the righteousness of God in Christ, we will reign in life over sin and death, defeat and depression, Satan and condemnation, unclean habits and adversity, through the One, Jesus Christ. (Romans 5:17) <br>  <br>  "For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ." (2 Corinthians 10:4-5)<br>  <br>  This verse shows the battle is taking place in our minds. We need to believe the gospel, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ. It doesn't say "the obedience to Christ" but "the obedience of Christ". It is Jesus' obedience at the cross that makes us righteous, not our obedience - "so also by one Man's obedience many will be made righteous." (Romans 5:19) When we believe we are righteous in Christ, God calls it "obedience to the faith". (Romans 16:26) This is new testament way of obedience. Right believing, once again, will produce right living. :)<br>  <br>  By the way, the imagery of the armour of God was taken from Isaiah 59:17-21. Paul must have taken reference from the passage, and it ends with the Word of God and praying in the Spirit too.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Peace be with you, sister.|`|aPuj6xoHaa	Ephesians 6:11-17  Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. <br>  For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. <br>  Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. <br>  Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, <br>  and, as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace. <br>  In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one; <br>  and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, <br>  <br>  Alone, we are not equipped to fight spiritual warfare.  Only by the power of God and only on our knees in prayer can we only hope to fight in the battle.

Who and/or what, are we fighting?  How do we know that it is spiritual?  Undeniably?  Wouldn't thoughts of fighting, in any sense or form, be highly stressful, for anyone, in everyday life?  Shouldn't we be more concerned about living, then we are about potentially dying, whether it's by a physical or spiritual nature?  Or by anything else, for that matter.  Anyone can read any text, in any language, from any religion and/or belief system.  But can anyone wake up on any given day and  know exactly, how to live?  I personally, rather spend my time "living," life, instead of "engaging" in any type or form of warfare.  Against anything and/or anyone.  How do we know that the battles we engage in, aren't against ourselves?  I do experience the same every day challenges in life, like everyone else, but I choose living my life, over choosing which battle to engage in, no matter what war seems to be going on around me.  Good luck in your life.<br>  The Jian.|`|N58YMuuxaa	awesome question!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>  1) <a href="http://www.pegsplace.us/armor.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pegsplace.us/armor.html</a> this web site will break it down for you.<br>  2) the full armor is worn by reading the bible and living by it, having faith, and guarding yer heart and mind.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

The angel told the disciples that Jesus "will come in just the same way as you have watched him go into heaven'. (Acts. 1:11) He said nothing about when. <br>     <br>      The apostle Paul told the Thessalonians in 1 Thess. 4:16 that the Lord would descend from heaven with a shout, and the dead in Christ would rise first, and then those who remained would be caught up in the air. He was speaking about the end of the world. In no way did Jesus promise to come back in their life times.<br>  <br>         Christians have always held to the hope that their generation would be the 'last' generation. But Jesus told us that no man knows the day nor the hour when the Son of Man would return. Even HE didn't know when He'd be coming back- only the Father knew.<br>  <br>        Many Christians today are sold on premillenial theology, which teaches the whole armeggedon argument, along with the rising of an anti-christ which supposedly ushers in the the return of Christ. This teaching, unfortunately, is only about 150 years old, and was not held by the church for over 1800 years. But Christians have always clung to the hope that Christ would return, simply because He said He would. Remember, God's timetable is not like ours. In the timetable of eternity, humans haven't been in existence for hardly a millisecond. The scripture says that a day is like a 1000 years, and a thousand years is like a day to the Lord. If God had said Jesus would return in 3 days, He could have meant 3000 years. Time is irrelevant to God.

If you purposely refuse to believe in God,  that is likely to be a problem.  I think you have an obligation to try sincerely to continue to evaluate the reasons for believing in God.  <br>  <br>  The overwhelming majority of human beings believe God exists.  Relatively few are atheists.  To be a committed atheist,  refusing to continue to consider the possibility that God exists is very arrogant.  It is basically a declaration that you are absolutely more insightful than over 95% of the human population.  That is not reasonable.  <br>  <br>  I think you have a moral obligation to consider the possibility that God exists,  and that God is likely to hold you accountable for any willful refusal to consider His existence.  Claiming that there is no evidence that He exists is not reasonable.  Thousands  of books have been published defending the existence of God.   If you haven't read at least a few dozen of them, you haven't even begun to weigh the evidence.  <br>  <br>  Read Augustine, Anselm, and Aquinas.  Read the Catechism of the Catholic Church.   Read the entire Bible.   If you have not done these things,  then you have chosen atheism without even considering some very easily accessible arguments for the existence of God.   Come up with an explanation for why every recorded civilization has a belief in God.  I think that is because we all are endowed by our Creator with an innate ability to see evidence of God in Creation.<br>  <br>  I hope and pray that you will be received by God into heaven.  I hope you will work toward that by receiving God into yourself here on Earth.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Well, if you willfully refuse to make the experiment to find out, then I'd say your highest reward is going to be the Terrestrial resurrection, but that is better than people can imagine anyway, so if you're good, kind, and by nature try to keep the commandments of God, you really don't have anything to worry about.  Silver medal kind of stuff.<br>  <br>  If you hold to your favorite sins and refuse to repent of them, then I'm not sure how you'll be judged, because you won't have had the full truth -- but if you refused to find out, then I'm puzzled about how you'll be judged.  I'm just glad that somebody as loving as God's son will be our judge.  I've felt God's love, and it's so indescribable that I'm sure his son is no slouch in that department, either.<br>  <br>  Regardless, we are judged by our works, and the more willing we are to try, the better off we are.  In my opinion, go for the gold.<br>  <br>  Gold > Silver > Bronze > Also ran<br>  Sun > Moon > Stars > Darkness<br>  Celestial > Terrestrial > Unnamed > Resurrection of Damnation<br>  Heaven 3 > Heaven 2 > Heaven 1 > Terrestrial reward > Unnamed reward > Outer Darkness<br>  <br>  Hell is destroyed by the atonement even as death is destroyed by the resurrection.

Why would you want to go to heaven?  <br>  Heaven is where God dwells, where we will be in the presence of the Lamb of God who shed His blood for us and have redeemed us in order for us to be with him for eternity.  <br>  Why would you want that?  If you refuse to come to Christ now, why would you want to come to Christ in heaven?<br>  Heaven is for those who hate sin, who love righteousness and the God who gave them this new love and desire for these things.  Heaven is for the redeemed who have been purchased by the blood of the Lamb.  Heaven is for those who are not great, or special, but poor, sick and in need of a Savior.  <br>  Repent and come to Jesus before it is too late.  If you are an atheist and Jesus is not your Lord and Savior you are NOT going to heaven.  The bible is very clear on that and God is not a liar.<br>  And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.

If nevertheless there is a disagreement . . . it should be remembered that the sacred writers, or more truly ‘the Spirit of God who spoke through them, did not wish to teach men such truths (as the inner structure of visible objects) which do not help anyone to salvation’; and that, for this reason, rather than trying to provide a scientific exposition of nature, they sometimes describe and treat these matters either in a somewhat figurative language or as the common manner of speech those times required, and indeed still requires nowadays in everyday life, even amongst most learned people" (Leo XIII, Providentissimus Deus 18).<br>  <br>  As the Catechism puts it, "Methodical research in all branches of knowledge, provided it is carried out in a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws, can never conflict with the faith, because the things of the world and the things the of the faith derive from the same God. The humble and persevering investigator of the secrets of nature is being led, as it were, by the hand of God in spite of himself, for it is God, the conserver of all things, who made them what they are" (CCC 159). The Catholic Church has no fear of science or scientific discovery.<br>  <br>  "Though faith is above reason, there can never be any real discrepancy between faith and reason. Since the same God who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has bestowed the light of reason on the human mind, God cannot deny himself, nor can truth ever contradict truth" (Catechism of the Catholic Church 159).|`|a4ad3310073cb2b40f98025759299834aa	it's kind of like trying to explain a cell phone to Alexander the Great.

You can only impart knowledge at the level of comprehension of the people receiving it. <br>  It is always better to let science explain how the world around us works and let our religions help us live in it with a pure spirit. <br>  Let science expand our knowledge and religion maintain our eternal being. <br>  Problems only arise when when you try to make one replace the other.|`|I93ynnVfaa	WHAT COUNCIL? Who was present?<br>  When people make these sort of claims, why are there NO FACTS?<br>  <br>  The Authors of The Bible did not care that it implied that the World was created about 3700 years before Moses' and the Exodus. If this is a LIE, they should NEVER have BELIEVED that ANYONE would EVER have the wherewithal to find out differently.<br>  <br>  From CARLOS CASTANEDA'S experience, where he and one CAROL TIGGS were both stranded stark naked in a remote Universe, and it was harder and harder for them to REMEMBER who they were and where they had come from when they <br>  <br>  1. Moved from their point of entry into that World (a bed).<br>  2. Used any of the items conveniently put by for their use (clothes).<br>  <br>  The DEVIL species evidently captured Humans and dispatched Mating Pairs to habitable Planets. According to the GENESIS account, there is NO PROOF that "The Garden of EDEN" was located on THIS EARTH. Why do we THINK that THIS is the Planet of Origin?<br>  <br>  If a Super Being could tell us to sacrifice animal blood to wash away sins- rather than address the sin and make up with our victims- THEN suddenly, 1300 years later, suddenly wake up as it were, and tell us, <br>  "I'm sorry! It was all a horrible mistake! HERE'S how you do it....!"<br>  ... I do not think that HE CARES awfully much about teaching us Astronomy and Natural History. You'll notice he led "His Chosen People" around for FORTY YEARS- count 'em! -and settled them in cosily in the ONLY land that had NO OIL- PROVE to me that THIS is an EXPERT in GEOLOGY? (At the very least He could have taught them Slant Drilling?) <br>  <br>  The Great Delusion of Bible Religionists is that we are following a Being Who CARES for us. He DOESN'T. We should STOP PRETENDING that He DOES. Pretending that The Bible tells the Absolute Truth and All We Need to Know has KILLED our predecessors. WHY can't we enjoy Thousand-year lifespans?<br>  "Well," our preachers will say, "there is a Bible Story that says....!"<br>  When Billy Graham and Pope John Paul II came down with Parkinson's Disease, I KNOW and DON'T need to CHECK, that they investigated EVERY single "UNBELIEVING SCUM ATHEIST" Western Medical Science cure available- while preaching and upholding the DAMNABLE Doctrines of their Denominations, that it MIGHT NOT be The Will of God to HEAL them or their Brethren.<br>  <br>  They preached this to get to where they were.<br>  Had they preached differntly, that it is The WILL of God to HEAL EVERYONE Who worships Him TRUTHFULLY, they would NEVER have been alowed to survive in their respective churches, and would have been expelled had they tried.<br>  <br>  Christian Churches are NOT about FACTS.<br>  If the facts favour their favorite positions, they USE them.<br>  If the facts DISPROVE their beliefs, they pretend they don't exist.<br>  The ONLY relevant books in the New Testament are the four that tell what Jesus actually taught. The rest are COUNTERFEIT.<br>  I heard that in Nazi Germany (?) there was a series of counterfeits that were so perfect, that the government decided to just leave them in circulation. That is sort of what the other Books besides The Law of Moses and The Gospel of Jesus are.<br>  <br>  The even partly-awakened Human Soul has the Power to Extrasensory peceive through the Barriers of Space and Time. To find out The Truth about our origins. This is USELESS if one is not going to FULLY awaken one's Human soul. The partially-awakened soul is prone to errors and delusions. The Goal of Total Awakening must be to pierce the Veil of these Delusions and thwart those beings projecting them.<br>  <br>  This should be a group-cooperative effort.<br>  The active members of this group will be required to support one another. For instance, when JESUS became a Teleporter, Satan snatched him away at least twice, and tried to get him to sin. This could have enabled The Devil to kill him, or at least strand him somewhere. It had happened that people gaining this power just vanished- never to be seen again. While others, with vigilant teammates were rescued by them- as happened with Dr. Castaneda.<br>  <br>  The stakes are very high, and I am amazed that people treat it in such a cavalier manner. Like the house is on fire, everyone knows where the fire extinguisher is, but everyone stands around doin g ANYTHING except go get it, and use it...!

At least learn what our arguments are before you try to argue against them.|`|UinOWcMUaa	How do you know there is no pain ?<br>  <br>  The true issue is what is God’s will? Before we can answer the ethical/moral question, we must distinguish between the two types of stem cells: adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells.<br>  <br>  Research on adult stem cells has been going on for decades and has proven that there are therapeutic effects in treating cancer, autoimmune diseases, leukemia, and heart disease. Adult stem cells are obtained from living bone marrow, blood, brain tissue, skin, and body fat. Other sources rich in adult stem cells are umbilical-cord blood and the placenta.<br>  <br>  However...<br>  Embryonic stem cells, as their name suggests, are derived from human embryos. In order to harvest embryonic stem cells, an embryo must be destroyed. Central to the debate, then, is our view of the human embryo. The biblical teaching is that human existence begins at conception (Psalm 139:13-16; Jeremiah 1:4-5). The international consensus of embryologists agrees with Scripture in that life begins at fertilization. At the moment of conception, the embryo is 100 percent human, with all 46 human chromosomes and a fully functioning, unique genetic code. Size and location do not determine humanity.<br>  <br>  Because research on embryonic stem cells requires the destruction of a living human being, it is against God’s will. No amount of promised “benefit” to society or to medical knowledge can justify the killing of a human for spare parts. The end does not justify the means. It is never ethical—in fact, it is morally reprehensible—to mark people for death in order to conduct utilitarian experiments on their body parts.|`|vSlG3ayiaa	First of all, the fact that it doesn't suffer is not sufficient to say it's okay to kill it.  Killing somebody in a coma doesn't cause them to suffer, but it's still wrong.  There are lots of painless ways to kill people, but that doesn't make it okay.<br>  <br>  I think it's wrong to kill a zygote because a zygote is a human being.  It differs only in its size, level of development, location, and level of dependency.  None of these things are morally relevant.  If size mattered, then 6 ft people would be more valuable than 5 ft people.  If level of development mattered, then teenagers would be more valuable than toddlers.  Location is obviously irrelevant.  If level of dependency mattered, then a 4 year old would be more valuable than a 1 year old.<br>  <br>  The zygote is a distinct living human being.  It has human DNA that is distinct from its mother's, it's growing, it's reproducing, it has metabolism, and it reacts to stimuli.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	1.  An ovary is not a potential human.  It needs a sperm to be complete.<br>  <br>  2.  That a human creature can not feel pain is not an excuse for killing that creature.  People in deep comas do not feel pain.  That does not permit us to actively kill them.<br>  <br>  3.  Any unique human creature that is alive needs to be treated with the dignity due to any human being.  In order to engage in embryonic stem cell research we would have to condone the treating of human creatures as mere objects.  That sets a terrible precedent.<br>  <br>  4.  From a practical perspective,  adult stem cell research is much more productive.  Not a single disease has been successfully treated by embryonic stem cell research or applications of that research.  It is a fraud to spend so much tax money on research that is not productive when adult stem cell research is very productive.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	If the "soul" enters at conception, how many souls do human chimeras have?

When the nerve network is developing it works and so does the brain in reading the signals sent from the nerves.<br>  Abortion is cruel to the unborn.

I do not weep for women's ovaries.<br>  When we give an upside (although a faulty upside) to abortion, such as stem cell research using the aborted fetus, it is a very bad thing.<br>  <br>  Please go to youtube and look up "the silent scream" and watch it.It is kind of long but bear with it.  If after watching the unborn child try to draw away from the instrument of death, this does not prove to you that they do indeed feel pain then I am afraid you are hopeless.<br>  <br>  Ther are other sources of stem cells.  A third type of stem cell has been isolated. They can be harvested from amniotic fluid which surrounds the fetus during pregnancy, or from the placenta which is delivered after birth and routinely discarded.<br>  <br>  <br>  BUMBLE BEAR: Please tell me you dont think that a chld was killed every time a woman has her period, please, please say it isn't so.|`|cVPq3s9zaa	Suffering isn't the issue.<br>  <br>  Giving someone a lethal dose of morphine doesn't make it okay just because the someone wouldn't "suffer any pain" from being given a lethal dose of morphine.<br>  <br>  And no, no one weeps for unfertilized "ovaries" (I'm sure you meant eggs).

jyqpeg40aa	The Gods Gifts - Nature, and nothing else. The Gods borned this planet and blessed it. There blessing turned into the valleys, the springs, the oceans, the mountains, the plants, and the animals. The Earth, the Wind, the Fire, the Water, and the Spirit. Everything you see is their gift to us and all we have to do is live. (Even though some messed up people choose to fight - go to war - kill) I don't understand why we take things like it (The Nature) for granted. Let the human spirit run its full course. Let it be reborn through the earth - our mother - and continue its journey through the ages...<br>  Sorry for going off like that. My answer is Nature.<br>  -Blessed Be|`|wGQvgeXDaa	Peace.

How can one not appreciate their beauty and see the divine in all of it?  I love the fact that my religion holds such high respect and reverence for nature.|`|AA10945101	The freedom.<br>  <br>  If allowed to choose the words, I would say that my "spirituality is Christian and that I have no religion".  If you can't accept Christianity as a personal philosophy rather than a collective religion, I won't object.<br>  <br>  For me, the message of Jesus represents the ultimate in freedom.  I know that many Christian religions advocate following complex sets of rules that hardly represent what most of us think about what it means to be "free".  However, I believe all of them that do are disregarding the instructions and the example of Jesus.  <br>  <br>  To me, the freedom in the message of Jesus is beautiful in its simplicity and its perfect understanding of the human psyche and the realities of life on earth! Jesus frees us from the one restriction on our freedom that is beyond our control...death. In doing so, Jesus frees us from all the worry (and fear and aggression and anger and frustration, etc...) we ALL waste on something that triggers our "survival instincts". (Note: I'm not saying that survival instincts are "bad", just that worry, anger, fear, etc... are pointless reactions that often cause more harm to the source than the target).  <br>  <br>  The complexity in the simplicity is also beautiful to me...the concept may be simple, but the implementation is beyond our comprehension.  The message of Jesus presents an endlessly fascinating challenge to free your heart and mind of all the chains that bind it to this planet and this lifetime.|`|90b77bbefba2eb318173c23604ffe4d2aa	The quiet time that God and I spend together in the evening.

AA12134591	This is not a new concern.  This particular subject has been the focus of some rather involved study over the last few years by numerous psychologists and sociologists ... exploring the impact of technology on Inter-personal skills of the social order at large...<br>  There have been some shocking results in some of the findings.  They have surmised that there are fewer and fewer people who are "comfortable" in dealing with others...especially new acquaintances and contacts...eye to eye...<br>  <br>  These are findings that should be getting at least some attention from the ones who are "in charge" of teaching the basics in all of the skills that are connected to the thousands of positions that have to work through person to person contacts....for, it seems, before long... there is going to be a severe shortage of people who can actually DO these jobs....

Some people say don't worry about the labels, but I think it is important to know yourself and where you stand.<br>  <br>  My faith developed over a long period and it was partly due to being on the internet and seeing how others talked about their faith.  While you are feeling uncertain, don't voluntarily say your beliefs, it is okay to stay quiet.  But if someone asks, then you can share if you trust the other person.  Also it is okay to say you don't have an answer.<br>  <br>  I hope you are able to come to peace with your beliefs someday!|`|C1r8C58oaa	life is al about what makes you happy. <br>  <br>  if you believe in something weather is religion or sex or politic remember  that the world is full of difference<br>  <br>  our differences help us to make our own opinion on on stuff . before we shout out and tell the world what we want to say think about how people will react. keeping our thorts inside our self's can hert us <br>  <br>  find a group of people that think the way you do this is the best place to talk and there shouldn't be any judge ments <br>  <br>  and make shore we are shore what we believe in is what we believe in.<br>  <br>  our mind can be distorted we learn from making mistakes and other influences <br>  <br>  time is distorted were it matters time goes fast were it dosent time never changes find a time and a place that makes you feel happy or do something that makes you feel happy with out herting other people

But if you want my opinion, it is this:<br>  <br>  Neo racism is like being in bizarro world. It's the use of previous victimization against the innocent descendants of the oppressors who are really trying to live differently than their barbaric forebears. It's the practised segregation of one's group - whoever they are, whether they are a visible 'minority' or a minority of faith or culture or orientation rather than race - from the majority by the use of auto(self)-stereotyping, negativity and exclusivity, as if 'tit for tat' ever solved anything.<br>  <br>  As a member of an invisible minority, I am often dismayed at the embrace of stereotypes as defining characteristics: most distressing. I am estranged from 'my people' because of the bigotry and hatred I have received at their tender mercy, being told that I 'didn't look right' or my behaviour was odd considering my heritage. My behaviour? What? I thought I was human, go figure.<br>  <br>  I guess in a way then, it has gone 'underground' by being held on to by its victims as a source of identity.

I had a dream once of a large cafeteria where I was serving dinner.  I remember the way the curtains around the windows looked and the flowers beyond the windows.  This was a place I had never been.<br>  About two years later, I took a job at a nursing home.  As I went to serve dinner to the residents, I saw the exact same windows with the curtains and flowers.  I almost dropped the tray because it was so weird.<br>  Nothing much came of it, I think it was just a way of showing me what was coming.  <br>  Do some research and I'm sure you'll come up with your answers.

UinOWcMUaa	I don't understand it either (ha,ha,ha)<br>  <br>  One reason as to why this is would be that people deny God on the basis of convenience; if there is no God than there is no such thing as truth or as moral laws. A persons denial of God allows them to do whatever they want. <br>  <br>  In addition, people don't want to be accountable for what they do. Everyone believes in something, even when you don't believe in God, that is something you believe in. It is the same with evolution or anything that man's mind contrives to keep from believing in God. Since they have to believe in something, they choose the thing that mocks God and Christians because Satan is behind it and hates God and those who are Christians. Like a pastor once said, "If you believe in evolution you have a lot more questions to answer than if you believe in God." For me and my house, we will serve the Lord. The Bible tells us that the scoffers and people who talk and act this way will soon pass away and we won't be able to find them. The Bible also says that God laughs at these type of things because of the nonsense they are made of etc. Psalm 1 is a good example plus a lot more. Psalm 14 also. They have a right to not believe in God just as I have a right to believe in Him. I have a lot more evidence that He is in my life and working everything for my good than they have that God does not exist. The Bible uses a word for these people but I won't say it.|`|a03839710389585e6d78d6e01faf9f91aa	Dude, Cure Homosexuality -  It's not a disease or a disorder u know.

Every improvement saves the lives of women who are involuntarily pregnant.  Certainly abortion is unfortunate, however necessary it might sometimes be.  But it's also unfortunate to need medical care at any time instead of being healthy and happy.  We cannot deny that we want medical care to be as good as possible unless we admit to wanting people to suffer.<br>  <br>  As to calling the Bible a lie, that does not take tax dollars.  All that takes is a moderate amount of ordinary intelligence.  The contradictions and just plain impossibilities are so glaring it is not rocket science.<br>  <br>  Scientists (with a few vocal exceptions) do not spend much time on denying God.

74b1131cf5ddd01a70564ef108e130bfaa	No, it's not a concern for me at all.  I find that most people who rail against the fact that women can't be priests, going on and on about how they find it discriminatory, aren't Catholic -- and therefore it's really none of their business. <br>  <br>  They don't seem to understand that the Church does not have the authority to ordain women as priests.  Unlike the discipline of celibacy for priests, which can be changed, this is immutable.  So there will be no gender neutralization of Catholic clergy regardless of who makes a fuss over it.|`|VPeb2fuTaa	I probably wouldn't find it quite so offensive if the Vatican didn't also deny that women have ever been religious leaders, despite clear Biblical, historical, and archaeological evidence of female bishops in the early Church.<br>  <br>  It seems to me that the lack of female priests (or priestesses, if you prefer) during the Middle Ages was due to the patriarchal nature of Europe at that time, NOT a lack of female role models in the early Church.  Women had rights in the Roman Empire that they didn't have in medieval Europe.  So it makes sense that there were female Christian leaders in the early Church (Chloe, Priscilla, Junia) but not in the Middle Ages.<br>  <br>  I believe that tradition is important, but so is a proper understanding of tradition.  Otherwise you're just doing things "because that's how we've always done them," never knowing why the tradition started in the first place.|`|Xu4x19y6aa	As a Catholic woman I'm not bothered by the fact that females can't be priests.

"Allowed" would indicate a rule.  The male priesthood is not a "rule" the Church has made.  It is an article of the faith, and as such CANNOT be changed by the Church, that the Church does not have the authority to ordain women.  This is based upon the clear teaching of Christ, Who revealed His divine will on the matter by choosing men as His first priests - 12 times out of 12!.  If Christ had wanted priestesses in His Church, surely He would have indicated this by selecting at least one.|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	It does not bother me as i see Women in Strong roles and positions in the Church.I'd hate to try and tell Mother Angelica who founded EWTN women are not important in the Church.I feel very uncomfortable around women Clergy.When my sister in law died a Lutheran Female Minister held the service and she looked like a mistake standing there in her black cassock and white collar and during her talk even took a dig at Catholics.I'll not go into the different reasons and thoughts i have about female Clergy but GOD created women to be a help mate not my words but the Bible's.|`|AA11440601	Not really, I trust in Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  WWJD? What would Jesus do?<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church currently teaches: <br>  <br>  The Lord Jesus chose men to form the college of the twelve apostles, and the apostles did the same when they chose collaborators to succeed them in their ministry. <br>  <br>  The Church recognizes herself to be bound by this choice made by the Lord himself. For this reason the ordination of women is not possible.<br>  <br>  For more information see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, sections 1577: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2sect2chpt3.shtml#1577" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2s...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|AA11466759	No.<br>  Not one twat.  twit...   wit.|`|VFWRdAH3aa	nope. doesn't bother me one little bit.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	No, it really doesn't.

If you read just the parts about Jesus in the gospels, if you just read what Jesus said and taught and ignore the rest, the things people said about him after he was gone, you can't find very much to disagree with.<br>  <br>  In fact, nothing Jesus taught was new or original with him.   He was just reminding Jewish people of the time what they were already supposed to believe.  If you read the Humanist Manifesto (Google it) you'll see that that philosophy of tolerance, cooperation, love thy neighbor, the brotherhood of man, etc., doesn't even really require belief in God!|`|EMVT2xjEaa	No<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Was Jesus Peaceable And Compassionate?<br>  The birth of Jesus was heralded with "Peace on Earth," yet Jesus said, "Think not that I am come to send peace: I came not to send peace but a sword." (Matthew 10:34) "He that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one." (Luke 22:36) "But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me." (Luke 19:27. In a parable, but spoken of favorably.)<br>  <br>  The burning of unbelievers during the Inquisition was based on the words of Jesus: "If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned." (John 15:6)<br>  <br>  Jesus looked at his critics "with anger" (Mark 3:5), and attacked merchants with a whip (John 2:15). He showed his respect for life by drowning innocent animals (Matthew 8:32). He refused to heal a sick child until he was pressured by the mother (Matthew 15:22-28).<br>  <br>  The most revealing aspect of his character was his promotion of eternal torment. "The Son of man [Jesus himself] shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth." (Matthew 13:41-42) "And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched." (Mark 9:43)<br>  <br>  Is this nice? Is it exemplary to make your point with threats of violence?

In fact I don't believe there is a supernatural and even seemingly supernatural phenomenon are all perfectly natural be they external or internal to the observer.<br>  <br>  When I die I currently believe the me that I identify as an individual ceases to have new experiences and the me that is part of a larger pattern of the super-organism we call humanity continues to exist through the influence I've had over other peoples lives, both small, large and accidental.  The me that is part of an emergent pattern of consciousness continues on until the heat death of the universe at minimum.<br>  <br>  I don't believe this dogmatically but I believe current models in physics, biology and anthropology either agree with or don't contradict this hypothesis and it gives me some comfort.|`|BFAbMbrIaa	The soul is our consciousness, our essence, the highest levels of our consciousness are not within the mind and body, they're in another dimension, what the Christians call heaven, what I call the quantum dimension. This is what the halo in christianity, the sun above the head of the egyptians, and the crown chakra above the head of the buddhists represents. What you think of as reality is really just a long dream, the material world isn't really material, matter is merely light energy vibrating at a close frequency. When we die our pineal gland releases a powerful dose of neurochemicals which sends us into the higher Quantum dimension... I think most people get stuck here though again and again until they realize their way out of it. The key is ascending before death and knowing your infinite godly self. At our highest level we are the universe, or possily the Sun itself having a human experience in a 3 dimensional material realm that we're creating based upon our perceptions and beliefs. Life is a big dream, and in order to realize it one must ascend above the dream occasionally.<br>  <br>  Our consciousness itself is created by the pineal gland which creates and releases the neurochemicals which make up our consciousness.. these neurochemicals are found in all plants and animals. Yes plants have consciousness also. The pineal gland is shaped like a pine cone, has a retina and a lens and is what is known as the 3rd eye, crown chakra, eye of horus etc. etc. The key that unlocks the door is the key that opens this eye, which can be done through various spiritual techniques most of which have been forbidden by religions and some of which work better than others. <br>  <br>  When water evaporates it doesn't just dissapear, it becomes vapor and eventually becomes water again... what all the religions and mysticism are about is this other dimension(s). It's where all the paranormal stuff comes from, most of the folklore, the religions, and the myths. It's the source, and the source of all the true arts and all science. The key is for the caterpillar to experience himself as the butterfly before he dies, not afterwards, if you wait until afterwards, I believe you probably get to do the whole thing over again until you come to the self realization that you are everything, and you created it. I don't expect you to take my word for it, it's something you gain knowledge of through direct personal experience and the ancient mythology when interpreted correctly can help explain the same thing, as does some of the basic concepts of quantum physics/mechanics.<br>  <br>  I'll fly a starship<br>  Across the Universe divide<br>  And when I reach the other side<br>  I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can<br>  Perhaps I may become a highwayman again<br>  Or I may simply be a single drop of rain<br>  But I will remain<br>  And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again...<br>  <br>  We're like the fallen angels/stars in the book of Enoch that came down from the heavens to have a human experience in the material world, and forgot how to return to our home in the cosmos... beings of light, having a human experience, a dream. Life is a magickal journey of experiences, treat it like one, it's your dream, make it the way you want it.|`|xhc55QGMaa	The brain is responsible for all perception. Since the brain makes deluded thoughts like souls, gods, and invisible pink unicorns, it is most logical to say this brain is indeed irrational. The brain is also physical. It has neurons combined to form a neural network and a mass that is the cortex and hippocampus and so on and so forth. When we die, we decompose. The physical brain is decomposed as well and withers away. Therefore there is no soul.|`|5bkmSQ3Raa	I've done considerable research on everything from fundamentalist Christianity to atheism,(I'm a member of the Richard Dawkins Forum) and I've come to the conclusion that God probably exists.  Atheists are always asking for evidence, but what they don't like to talk about is that they don't have any either.  Yes, I'm familiar with that thing about not being able to prove a negative, but, by me, either you can prove what you do or do not believe or you can't, and, so far, atheists can't prove anything.  At best, science gets the grade of "incomplete," and it requires as much faith to believe that science will have a better set of answers someday than it does not.  In a sense, we are a consciousness that's walking around in a flesh and blood body.  We know what happens to the flesh and blood part of our being, but there's no reason to believe and no proof either way that our consciousness ceases to exist and have experiences in other parts of the cosmos.  Somehow, it seems to me that our consciousness, our spirit, our soul and whatever makes up that part of our being continues to exist in some form.  Can I prove it to you?  No way!  Maybe you can prove it to yourself one way or another.  Best wishes!|`|XoUfUl6Yaa	In my brief years studying anatomy I have not once stumbled across the fabled "soul".

90b77bbefba2eb318173c23604ffe4d2aa	Catholics are CHRISTIANS. Sorry, one of my little peeves there.  For some reason, know only to them, many Fundamentalist think that they are the only Christians and they hate the Roman Catholics.  Let me teach you a bit and then you can know more than the rest of your friends.<br>  <br>  In the beginning there was Jesus and his 12 followers. You probably know the story.. he died and rose from the dead, etc. And his disciples started teaching in the Jewish synagogues the things that Jesus taught them. They were all Jewish. Later they started letting non-Jews join. They were first called Christian at Antioch. Eventually they became more organized and the first Churches started. Until 1054 there was only one branch of the Christian church. After 1054 there were two, the Orthrodox in the east and the Catholic in the west. Later during the reformation in the western church all these other groups sprang up. Some, like my own chruch, the Anglican, consider themselves to also be Catholic. That is why I call the church at Rome the Roman Catholic Church. Because they are not the only ones who can claim that name. (Orthrodox means 'right practice, right belief' and Catholic means 'universal'.)<br>  <br>  The Protestant church are at least 200 different groups. It is from this group that we get the strict Fundamentalist, such as the Baptist and others. They think that a person has to be 'saved' by accepting Jesus as their personal savior and that is all a person has to do, so for them all the rest of the Christian church are not 'really' Christians.  These people are wrong and they know very little about theology.  From the beginning of the Christian church, it has been 'baptism' that saves a person. The Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church are very good when it comes to having a body of theology that come from the very early church and is sound.<br>  <br>  In answer to the first person who answered you: Roman Catholics, Orthrodox and Anglicans do not pray to the Saints and the Virgin Mary, we ask the Saints and the Blessed Virgin to pray WITH us to God. The more people praying for an intention the better. And the thought is that Mary and the Saints are closer to God and it might help to ask them to put in a word for us. We worship God and pray to God directly or to Jesus. Some people feel more of a connection with a Saint or with Mary and that is OK. What they see in the Saint or Mary is a reflection of God.|`|971d3daea9af9b7b15f437ab3cfcc861aa	Catholics are christians.  However, not all christians are catholics.  Catholicism is just a branch of christianity - just like baptists, methodists, lutherans, etc.  They're all essentially the same belief system, they just have slightly different views on things.  <br>  <br>  My problem, here, though is that you say you are a catholic, yet you don't know much about it.  Please, honey, do some research and find out what you believe before you identify yourself with a religion.  Just because your parents or your grandparents are part of a religion does not make you part of the same religion by default.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything.|`|wia35rNKaa	Christians was a derogatory name for the jews that followed christ...those christ-ians!<br>  So not all the Jews beleived Jesus was the messiah. The ones who did were still jews, they jsut beleived christ to be messiah.<br>  They allowed non-jews (gentiles) to believe that christ was messiah...something the jews would never do, allow gentiles into their religion. And more so, these new "christians" said that it was not necessary to follow all the jewish laws that were traditional at that time. If you wanted to be jewish, you had to follow the laws of moses and all the traditions.<br>  <br>  That was around for arguments sake, between 0-100. For the next hundred years, christianity went through growing pains. I am unsure when the term catholic was first used, but yes, catholic means universal, meaning that this was the universal religion, for everyone.<br>  <br>  There have been so many splits it is actually fairly difficult to count all of them, but one of the biggest things was martin luther around 1517. He got fed up with the roman catholic church and started what became the protestant reformation (The word Protestant is derived from the Latin protestari meaning publicly declare-1). Under christianity you have roman catholic, eastern orthodox, and protestant, I believe each one having additional splits underneath it. <br>  Christianity is anyone who believes in christ as messiah...catholicism is one of many different ways that is done.<br>  I know that in a catholic church, you have statues of saints and jesus on a cross in the buildings themselves. Other religions differ in what they believe...some dont beleive in saints, some have no pictures orstatues etc.<br>  <br>  And the catholics have the pope as their head man in charge...no other christian divisions look to the pope as their religious leader, only the roman catholics I believe.

The New Testament was compiled in the 4th century of text ostensible written by people who lived in the 1st century.  There was never a general call for submissions.  The authors of the New Testament are considered some of the most holy people in Christianity.  I highly doubt Augustine would have suggested he somehow deserved to be included in their ranks.<br>  <br>  It is true that the Bible was already essentially a finished product by the time of Augustine.<br>  <br>  I'm unsure what you think Augustine would have wanted to add.  i've always thought the Bible pretty clearly supported the notion of free will: you choose your path, and God holds you accountable for your choices.|`|PwD3slrTaa	And I read somewhere that killer bees would eradicate the United States by 2002.

I always use my logic since I feel that as long as it's logic, it can't be wrong.  I am a Christian(Catholic) and I don't agree with everything the Pope says.  I know a lot of Priests who don't agree with everything the Pope says.  I go to Church every Sunday and most of what is said makes sense but there are things I just ignore because it doesn't sound right at all and I'm not the all black or white person.  I'm somewhere in the grey zone.  All situations are not the same, so there's not only one answer for all problems.  I do believe in the Catholic Church since it was the first Christian religion.  However, we all pray the same God so we're all the same.  Not one religion would be the perfect one since I would disagree with something everywhere.  It's unrealistic to say that my religion or the other religion is the perfect one.  I have to admit that when I go to Church I feel peaceful and I call it my spiritual vitamin, like we need good food and exercise.  I hope I didn't confuse you.  I'm just saying that even though you don't agree with everything, going to Church is still good for you and it's incredible how the readings or sermons can really hit you most Sundays, it's like it had been there waiting for you to answer some of the questions you have at that exact time.  It's just my view.
D4XWrwuaaa	I thought the Devil made them, but now I think they came from your evil eyeball!  Yowzers it's creepy!|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	Feminism came from Satan. God established the man's and woman's role that has been the same for thousands of years; men and women have upset this balance, and now everything is out of whack. Pride, which is a sin, is the only thing that would cause a woman to want to usurp her husband and abandon the very important role of raising the family. When the mother leaves her role, the whole family suffers. When the father leaves his role, the whole family suffers. When families suffer, society as a whole suffers, because the family unit is the basis of society. Why does a woman need to go out and get a job outside of the home, if the husband is providing for his family? If a family eliminates all extraneous spending, a family can live just fine on a single income, even today. If a woman who has a family to take care of goes out to get a job "just because she wants to", then she is being selfish, and she is depriving her children of her presence and guidance, and she must rely on strangers to raise her children.<br>  I think God had a pretty good blueprint for the human family, but today there are many forces in our society that would love nothing more than to destroy the family unit.|`|k3LbhASGaa	To be honest everything that causes a war , even between the sexes is from the devil|`|WjSJBWl7aa	They THINK they came from god<br>  <br>  But do not dare assosiate them with the devil.. it's giving him a bad name.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And yes I'm a chick.

Have you considered the basic tenant that all things are by random chance and considered the tremendous observable evidence that there is nothing random at all. And you have to piggyback a millions of randomly parlayed impossibilities to validate that theory.  if you look at  at mount rushmore you would never think that those faces appeared from erosion.  Even a simple arrowhead can be distinguished from a pile of rocks by its inherent design elements.  The genetic Code DNA RNA have you researched the complexity of these?  There is nothing random about DNA..you have more faith than your friend...Even your nature videos back the bible when they show animals in the wild then the guy with the deep voice comes in and says something like.."all species live in a harmonious balance that is except one, man who has eliminated the natural habitat....isn't it funny how habitats can fall apart when someone introduces a non native species into it.

I am a firm believer in Creationism because it is based on the word of God.  True Creationism cannot be proven, just like evolution cannot be proven.<br>  True Science is based on the present and what you can test and see.  Evolution and creation cannot be tested or seen today, so it is just a theory.  But I choose to believe I was created by God with a purpose and by design.  Instead of believing I just accidentally came into existence by rocks and rain in some primordial soup.  <br>  I think it takes more faith to believe that than in God and creation.  But everyone has their own opinion on things and right to beleive what they want.  Even if they are wrong.  LOL<br>  Ask him to take you off his email list because you don't agree with him and therefore do not want to read something that would come against your beliefs because you are not open minded.

This is the problem in the first place. No one really knows for sure anyways, so why can't anyone believe whatever they want as long as it's not unhealthy.<br>  <br>  You should simply tell him that it makes you uncomfortable and ask him to stop, point out that you wouldn't try and push your beliefs onto him, so you'd expect the same respect in return.<br>  <br>  People have many beliefs, some believe in God, some believe in Evolution, some believe that they both go hand-in-hand, the bottom line is that no matter what you believe it's all theory, none of it can be proved or disproved in human terms.<br>  <br>  The most intelligent belief in human terms, is to recognize that we don't know anything for sure.

zB6FmIosaa	The Bible is composed of writings of many different people, in different places, during different time periods.  Yet, it is still the inspired word of God.  The books that make up the old testament were studied, memorized, and copied word for word by people such as the Pharisee's and Scribes.  These people's sole life revolved around those scriptures.  The New Testament is made up of the four gospels and then letters written to specific people or churches.  After these were written the believers of the early church took care in making copies of these works again word for word.<br>  <br>  The translations and editions that are listed above came directly from these manuscripts.  The King James Version was the first to be translated into English.  However as more manuscripts that dated closer to the original time period were found then updates and new translations came out that correspond most directly with the text.  Though the original script is not here today, the manuscripts that the Bible is based off of date back to within one hundred years of the originals.|`|LKyGCaFQaa	Ill quote Fredrick Nietzsche "There is no original text" No on really knows what the original text said, you only have loose transltions with what ever guy who translated it adding i what ever he wants.

As a matter of fact, what is the oldest Koran in existence...? (Careful -- don't make something up -- I expect source documentation).  You have no way of knowing that the Koran is exactly as the original since the original does not exist.  Just turning your "logic" back in your direction.  All you have is your tradition that SAYS the Koran has never been changed.  No way to prove that statement at all.<br>  <br>  There are actually fragments of original manuscripts in museums. <br>  <br>  Further, although the translations you list differ linguistically, they agree in content, intention, meaning and form. It might be hard for you to understand, but the strength of the Bible is that it CAN be translated so many different ways and still unite and inform the faith of its believers and draw new believers into the fold.<br>  <br>  Additionally, with the finding of the Dead Sea Scrolls which pre-dated the oldest known copy of the book of Isaiah by about 800 years, it was discovered that the book of Isaiah had been passed on  in practically perfect form, proving it's reliability as a manuscript.<br>  <br>  ________________<br>  But the entire point,is that you can't PROVE it your claim, since you ALSO do not have the original. Also, there is historical evidence that there were in fact several different versions of the Koran.<br>  <br>  You might not like it, and you might not be able to fathom the logical fallacy you are so adamantly defending -- but it is in fact a logical fallacy.

His statements just could be interpreted as implying that he might be, but it is not what one would call a bold proclamation that he is God.  One looks back to old testament and God does not appear to use subtle riddles to identify himself as being God.<br>  <br>  So, perhaps the conclusion that Jesus is God may not be his intent. Jesus does allude to himself as a prophet.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	Galatians 3<br>  19 What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was put into effect through angels by a mediator. 20 A mediator, however, does not represent just one party; but God is one. <br>  <br>  Moses was the mediator with the Law. It wasn't Christ. And Paul reveals that it was put into effect by a mediator; who was Moses. The New Covenant did away with the Old Covenant because it was better. Through the New Covenant, men could be saved; while the old one put men to death.<br>  <br>  So these verses have nothing to do with the nature of God other than the statement; God is One. We have a better Mediator, of which Moses was only a type of Christ as so many things were in the Old Testament a type of Christ; a shadow of things to come.<br>  <br>  Dueteronomy 4<br>   39 Acknowledge and take to heart this day that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other. 40 Keep his decrees and commands, which I am giving you today, so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long in the land the LORD your God gives you for all time.<br>  <br>  <br>  They could not keep the covenant. The only one who could keep the covenant was God. He did His part, and after forgiving those under the Old Covenant many many times. So there was no peace with God because He was the only one keeping it; Christ kept it. Again, only God could keep the Old Covenant; Christ showed them He could do it. And so Christ was the perfect servant, the one who did not break the Old Covenant.<br>  <br>  When Jesus was crucified on the cross even though he did not incur the curse of the Law (if you live by this Law you shall live), He made it so that sinning man could also join in on His Righteousness. And so the Old Testament promises of God; especially those having to do with revelations of His nature, they become revealed in the New Testament. i.e. The Lord has become my salvation(Exodus 15:2;Psalm 118:14;Isaiah 12:2). The Lord is my Savior (2 Samuel 22:47;Psalm 24:5;Psalm 68:19; etc).

If you believe the Bible has a message for you, can't you just be happy with that instead of trying to pick apart every little insignificant detail?

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

The church then could claim exclusive control over the editing process.<br>  <br>  What this means is that even if God had had a lot to say over thousands of years, God would no longer be allowed to add new books.

hJAtgbb8aa	You worried about the culture of India?<br>  Then answer these questions for me:<br>  1) Is explicity a part of India's culture?<br>  I ask this because I see Remma Lamba turning to Malika Sherawat and becoming popular for exposing the parts of her body an traditional Indian woman wouldn't do. Indians wear full clothes to cover their body, especially women, they wear their dupatta because of their cultural beliefs? Do we see a lot of them wearing those now? We get to see girls wearing Miniskirts and jeans, and it is ok.<br>  <br>  2) Is kissing on the lips what Indians do, to show that they love their partner?<br>  Emran Hashmi and Malika Sherawat kissed each other in films, and now other actors and actresses are doing so. Till the 90s, I've seen nothing more than hugs, but now I get to see sex scenes, that are frowned upon by many of the Indian people.<br>  How is THAT related to the Indian culture?<br>  <br>  3) Indians have made explicit movies too, especially the ones by Mira Nair. I'm sure you must have heard of his movie "Kamasutra" where an INDIAN WOMAN exposed her naked body (by that I mean her breasts and her genitalia) and had very explicit love-making scenes. Since when is that a part of the culture? It's popular now.<br>  <br>  THOSE aren't and were never a part of the Indian culture, and they are acceptable.<br>  Fine.<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is not WRONG, and it is certainly not BAD. Do you even know that there are hundreds of closeted homosexual people who are forced to live a typical heterosexual life and they end up being unhappy? <br>  I'm sorry, you can accept all those, but can't accept what's actually good for the country. The world is becoming more open minded, and if the media helps the close minded cultures to open their minds, then there should not be any problem.<br>  Being gay is not unnatural. It is as normal as it is being a heterosexual. There are many proofs out there you can research that states homosexuality is indeed natural, and so they need to be accepted.<br>  <br>  I say what is the problem if people start accepting gay people for being who they are?<br>  That's something good and will give gay people a chance to survive their life the way they want it to, cause we only get one life to live.<br>  What they film industry is doing is good, but they are not so open minded about homosexuality yet.<br>  Even Dostana has a dialogue where Priyanka says "It's your choice and I'm absolutely okay with that. I believe in gay rights."<br>  Well, there is your bug....being gay is not a CHOICE.<br>  <br>  (\_(\<br>  (=' :') --<I ?

It's due to the wavelengths, I think.<br>  <br>  As for the chakras, I think the color has more so to do with what they represent.  At the root chakra you have red, and I could see that being connected with carnal and earthly things.  At the crown chakra you have purple, which was the highest visible frequency.  Traditionally, things closer to "the heavens" have been associated with more "spiritual" things.|`|nM7xmhgiaa	Chakras are a concept in Kundalini Yoga. They are abstract notions and have no physical reality. <br>  Kundalini practice is considered  a Tantric Yoga and is avoided by truly spiritual seekers. The practice only entices a person away from the straight and narrow road to realization.<br>  Most Tantric rituals have elaborate imagery associated with them The attributes of chakras are to be seen in that context.|`|NB3vDR7zaa	color and energy purple is a higher energy frequency.

It is through God's Grace alone that we are saved. and His Grace for us was the giving of His Son Jesus Christ to die on the Cross for our sins.We tend to disobey God because of our stupidity and ignorance which is our nature. As Christians we try our best not to but because of our nature we stumble but we repent and ask the Lord to forgive us and continue on with our walk in Christ Jesus.|`|AgiwOGbUaa	if you believe in g-- you do not choose to disobey, you were MADE imperfect and therefore you learn from your mistakes and grow as an individual.

There is a big difference.  A non-christian disobeys God because that is his nature.  He has inherited the sins of Adam and therefore is an enemy of God and his nature is depraved and sinful.  He refused to follow God's laws and refuses to come to Christ as God commands.<br>  A Christian disobeys God because he is not perfect and is trying to practice righteousness but at times fails and must repent.  But a true Christian does not disobey God intentionally.  He is striving for holiness and has victory over sin.  HE is no longer a slave to it or in bondage to it, but because he is still in this body of flesh he must war against sin.  Sometimes succumbing to it but reluctantly and immediately convicted by the Holy Spirit to repentance.|`|KI4NieoTaa	Im sorry, i just find it very confusing, by how one man can be watching over everyone, and seem to make all the rules up when he isnt here.<br>  <br>  Sorry if i offended you, but theres not such thing as god.

It's about culture and upbringing.  In my experience as a college student and tutor, it seems to me that immigrants of any race seem more dedicated and studious about academics than natural born americans.  These immigrants have usually come here from poorer countries specifically for educational and economic oppurtunity and are sometimes highly pressured by their parents to succeed in the career world.  So they're usually more motivated to study and thus outperform their american born peers.   Being born and raised american, it somewhat shames me to say that my country tends to produce people who don't highly value education and intellectual pursuits.

The important thing is to trust that God is with us, even when we don't "feel" that way.  During rough times it's ok to doubt, and natural to wonder where God is in all of this.  I hope you will look and find the small ways that God reminds you He is present and loves you.  Try to look at the things you have to be grateful for, the good friends who stick by you no matter what, the fact that your dad didn't die of a heart attack, the opportunities that will come to make new friends.

4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	In short, it's a myth.  The only back masking you really find on any rock records are stuff that the band put on there as an intentional joke.<br>  <br>  When you hear a voice recording being played backwards, you're going to hear human vowels and consonant sounds.  Trying to find patterns in things is a natural psychological phenomenon.  Another one is the power of suggestion.  If you're TOLD beforehand that a recording sounds like somebody saying "Kill the Family", then that's what your ears will "hear" when it's being played.  But if instead you were told beforehand that the same gibberish recording was saying "Bill loves Emily", then that's what you'd interpret instead.<br>  <br>  As comedian Bill Hicks pointed out, it also makes no sense that a rock star would want his audience (read: his source of income) dead.  <br>  <br>  Even if bands were doing this, there is absolutely no shred of scientific evidence that unnoticed back-masked messages have any effect on the human mind.  This was shown in court during the Judas Priest trials.|`|U4fmCI7Zaa	We're constantly looking for patterns, including sounds in backwards music, faces in clouds, and grilled cheese sandwiches, etc.<br>  <br>  The idea behind it, is basically, a misinterpreted sound isn't a big deal, but a missed sound could be a predator coming up to eat your ***.<br>  <br>  Anyone who hears satanic messages, is hearing them due to this effect.|`|edOU65xAaa	.sdik yfoog fo hcnub a rof murof tihs llub a s'ti ekil sdnuos tI  !emit fo etsaw latot a si srewsnA oohaY fi rednow ot gninnigeb m'I|`|lfjTRFzFaa	!!!!nataS evol  I|`|wsc96EDmaa	fake, wishful thinking on the part of religious alarmists|`|bKwCs8zhaa	I'm simply weirded out by the 2 eye close up avatars here.|`|URjwNyYraa	Crap|`|FfxmE9Toaa	It's nonsense.<br>  <br>  I remember a rock station years ago played Frank Sinatra records backwards and found "Rocco, break his legs".|`|WjRqYf6naa	It's a myth, perpetuated by the well-meaning but gullible.

AA10830892	The Catholic Church declares that it does not have the authority to ordain women to the Priesthood.  This is because of fidelity to the Divine Will (the Will of God, as manifested to the Church through Christ).  The Church only says NO to the ordination of women to the Priesthood because she seeks to remain faithful to Christ in all things.  Christ was not anti-women in any way, as some detractors claim.  It was merely the Will of God (and of Christ) to reserve the Sacred Priesthood to men.  <br>  <br>  There are, every now and then, stories of women being "ordained" as Catholic priests.  This does not fool the Church, and it should not fool you.  Just because someone says, "I was ordained" or just because someone goes through a ceremony following the ordination rites, it does not make that person ordained.  Just like the Church has no authority whatsoever to consecrate milk and cookies into the Body and Blood of Christ, but must use bread and wine, so too the Church is incapable of ordaining a non-male human being, or a non human being, or anything else to the Priesthood.  Only a man (in the gender-exclusive sense) is capable of receiving the Sacrament of Holy Orders.<br>  <br>  If you have a problem with this, I suggest you take it up with God -- not with the Church, as the Church cannot change the Will of God.  She is faithful to Christ, yesterday, today and for ever. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	No there are not any female priests in Catholicism, never were, and never will be.  It has nothing to do with "allowing".  "Allowing" refers to a rule made by the Church.  The male priesthood is not a "rule".  It is an article of the faith, and therefore cannot be changed, that Christ's Church does not have the authority to ordain women.  This is based on the clear example of Christ who, 12 times out of 12, chose men to be His first priests.  This is understood to be a clear statement of His divine will.

There might be an errant bishop allowing women to receive the Holy Sacrament of Ordination, BUT - since said Sacrament was meant for men ONLY, and the fact the bishop is still administering it despite knowing this - the reception of Ordination under these circumstances is rendered invalid. Thus, those women are not actually ordained priests.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	No, women are NOT ordained as priests in the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  Some looney chicks have had themselves ordained "secretly" and now consider themselves to be priests, but they aren't.

The Bible does record a woman named Phoebe who was a "Deaconess" (Romans 16:1-2).  It is unclear whether she was married to a Deacon or not in order to obtain this title or not.  The title itself means "servant", so exactly what Phoebe or other deaconesses did is not clear.

g4nlUfmeaa	First, it's a work of literature, and any piece of literature will use language that is often vague; symbolism, metaphor, allegory, figurative language, etc.  This infuses the work with greater impact and appeal than a dry statement of facts and values, but can also introduce ambiguity.  Also, sometimes writers and storytellers just don't do their job very well.<br>  <br>  On top of that, you have to realize that is a series of first-hand, second-hand and third-hand accounts written by a number of different authors compiled years (decades or even centuries in the case of the Old Testament) after the events described allegedly happened.  Each author had their own unique perspective and intended message.  Ink, paper and parchment doesn't last forever and preservation of the texts required hand-copying -- a process prone to some amount of error.  Translation of the Bible into different languages also would inevitably introduce additional inconsistencies.<br>  <br>  At every step in the process is an opportunity to introduce confusion and error: from perception, to the recall of memories, to the oral transmission of a story, to its composition in writing, to its copying and compilation, to its copying and translation.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Misinterpretation is the direct result of rejection of the one genuine authority Christ provided - His Church - the Church which the Bible calls "the pillar and foundation of truth".  No structure can stand once removed from its pillars and foundation.  The truth cannot stand once removed from the Church Christ founded, the Church to which He promised "whatsoever you bind upon earth is bound in heaven", and "the Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth", and "he who hears you hears Me".  Misinterpretation is the cause of denominationalism, which is why Protestantism, lacking any authoritative means of interpreting the Bible, has fragmented into thousands of conflicting denominations in a few hundred years, while the true Church founded by Jesus Christ for all mankind continues to teach the fullness of truth in unity, without denominations and without misinterpretation, after 2,000 years.  It is all very clear in His own Church.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	To be honest I even ask that question.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Well, the original books were probably much clearer when they were written, and that is an important thing to consider.<br>  <br>  However, in the strict sense you want, people confuse the issue by trying to make the Bible agree with their opinions and philosophies rather than the other way around.|`|ttCkz39aaa	There are only 3 answers which should  without a doubt clarify what you're asking,   !st-  God moves in mysterious ways   2nd-  Well darn it we just don't have the capabilities to understand why god does what he does.

New translations are written all the time.  The Bible is an odd book in that most people walk away with what they came in with after reading it.  Being raised in the south I've heard it used to justify bigotry, and violence.  People with kind gentle natures tend to walk away after reading it a bit kinder and gentler.  The secret to it's success is this ambiguity that almost anyone can relate to.  It isn't very good at getting everyone to walk away with the same message, never was.

It was written originally by many different people.  Some of it may be based on oral tradition.  And it has passed through lots of translations.  And learning traditions that were available to, for example, ancient Israelites that allowed them to understand the parables and other types of written mysteries (Isaiah for example) are not available, or at least not widely available right now.

I believe the interpretation is up to the individual who actually picks it up and reads it! Everyone I know gets something different from every chapter and every verse. I believe it is what it is so anybody can pick it up and get something spiritually positive from it. The problem comes when a person sees it one specific way and holds that one little passage as an absolute truth and will not accept any one else's view or description.|`|D6FBLQfwaa	Factually speaking, the writers of the gospels were catering to different audiences, so they put different spins on things in order to convince the crowd. Plus, a lot of the new testament is simply mistranslated copies of the old testament's prophecies. Your question is a very good one. It seems odd to me that an all-powerful god would be so vague and indirect with his commands, and that the bible's literal statements directly contradict each other, while supposed "metaphoric" statements leave the reader to decide what is meant. My best guess, is simply that the bible is written by men, none of which directly met jesus or "the father" so they honestly didn't know.

9gIMtB9Iaa	In making the golden calf the children of Israel sinned against God (thou shalt have no other gods before me).<br>  <br>  At the end of Exodus 34, God made a new covenant with the children of Israel, as Moses asked for the grace of God and His forgiveness due to the sin of the golden calf.  God forgave them of this sin and made a new covenant, in which He promised to bless them if they would obey his commandments (among them, "make no molten image").
VMYnjl5Saa	ok friend, i will put this as simply as possible. I think christian values are respectable to an extent, i agree with the commandments, sure, don't kill, steal, or cheat etc.... however, christians believe some crazy and outlandish things. They believe a woman who has been severely beaten by her husband will go to hell if she divorces him (the bible clearly states adultery is the only just cause for divorce)...some christians will tell you that because this is old testament material, it "doesn't count", and that the christians of old didn't mean this in literal terms. i think it's cute that they decide what 'counts' and what doesn't.<br>  <br>  to get to my point, the christian view clearly states, 'believe and act exactly as i do, or you are eternally punished, severely punished at that'...a man who is raised in iran, taught from birth to believe that islam is his way into salvation, because he has never heard any other side of any type of any religion, and is killed at the age of 13, will be immediately sentenced to hell because he hasn't been saved by a god that he's never heard of; instead he has been worshiping 'false idols'. (reference 1st commandment: believe in the one god; the one and only god)<br>  <br>  they believe that only they are right. no one else's religion can be honored, for if they honor such, hell awaits. my friend, christians have good morals, good values, and a horrible sense of reality. feel proud of yourself for having your own opinion. answer: it is clearly immoral to send someone to hell because he/she has different opinions/beliefs than anyone else. if you believe in anything, believe that you as a human, are entitled to believe anything you want. any god that negatively judges you for sticking to your beliefs and establishing your own opinions, is no god you want to associate with.|`|rWtAsqIEaa	Arrogance, History.<br>  <br>  I think it's more important to be a good person than to believe in some religion.

It has to be the right one, it makes you instantly better than those who have different views. Better yet, it is more or less socially acceptable to think so (Most countries have a majority religion).<br>  <br>  I also mention history as a factor. remember the Spanish inquisition?

Lots of us Christians do not even believe in hell. You don't like Xians stereotyping you as being immoral! Well, two wrongs don't make a right. <br>  <br>  In answer to your question, though, there are several reasons, depending on the specific Christian in question:<br>  <br>  1. They believe that only by believing in God can you be moral, thus by definition atheists are immoral. The very act of believing is the basis of morality. These are the ones that say they are moral, but then treat everyone like crap. <br>  <br>  2. Similar to the first one, but a little different-- many Christians base their morality on their religion. Only instead of thinking that the belief itself is what makes you moral, they believe their actions are moral, and therefore connected to the religion itself. In other words, they are good to other people or don't murder or steal BECAUSE they are religious. They then assume that other people must not be moral if they don't believe the same thing. It is simply faulty logic that they assume atheists are not moral. These Christians are well-meaning, but simply do not understand atheists. <br>  <br>  3. Some Christians (who can fall into either category above, but not necessarily) believe atheists are immoral because the only ones they run into are in places like Y!A where many of the atheists only communicate with them in order to trash on their religious beliefs. It is the same reason that so many atheists think Christians are ignorant or pushy-- many are not, but those are not the ones that are coming around and arguing with you all the time. So your perceived impression is that they are just bad people. <br>  <br>  4. For some it is just a logical conclusion to this fact: if God does not exist, you may be moral, but ultimately there is no reason for it. If there is no God, then we're here simply by arbitrary evolution. Love, goodness, and meaning are all inventions of our mind to rationalize our meaningless lives. If there is no God and you are a moral person and not just out for yourself, you are fooling yourself just as much as someone who believes in God. <br>  <br>  That said, plenty of us know that atheists have the capacity for being moral and just, even as well as Christians do. I, for one, believe in a rational, logical, caring God. Thus, I expect that God will recognize the morality in you when the time comes. And if God doesn't exist, it won't even matter either way. LOL!|`|hcc8fq7jaa	There is a lot of hostility in this country towards Christianity from some atheists. When someone insists upon insulting you and your beliefs, it's hard to see them as anything but immoral. However, I don't think atheists are inherently immoral, nor do I think most Christians do.<br>  Regarding the second part of your question: In the Judeo/Christian faiths, only God can send someone to hell. And I don't believe He would send you to hell for cussing. If He did, I'd be in a shi*load of trouble!|`|tI1NHwfBaa	We all have moral values.<br>  <br>  Look at the cultures and people groups of the world, and you'll quickly see that they all have an innate sense of right and wrong.  While there's some variation, we all seem to just "get it" that rape, murder, child abuse and such are wrong, and that self-sacrifice and concern for others are right.<br>  <br>  Evolutionary theory doesn't adequately explain these values.  They remain largely the same throughout human history, and they're consistent among people.  As cultures and symbols vary -- for instance, it's an insult to show the bottom of your shoe to someone in one culture but not another -- these things just don't.  They're the same, throughout history and across humanity.<br>  <br>  And that's evidence that there is some outside, external, absolute meaning for right and wrong.<br>  <br>  If objective moral values exist (and they most certainly do) then God must exist.<br>  <br>  If it was religion that gave us moral values, then it would be obvious that we all need religion.  But clearly you don't have to be religious to be moral.  <br>  <br>  And that points to an external source for morality.<br>  <br>  The interesting thing about it, though, is that we DON'T behave the way we know we should.  In the animal kingdom, animals have no trouble acting out of instinct.  Not so with humans.  We know how we should behave.  We fail to do it.<br>  <br>  And that's sin.  And that's why we deserve Hell -- for our own rebellion and seeking our own way.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, none of us needs to endure that punishment.  Jesus Christ paid the way so that each and every one of us can be reconciled to God.  It's not something we have to be "good enough" for, or work towards.  That's awesome!|`|wM7pprr1aa	They got their morals from their book, they see Muslims getting morals from /their/ book, Jews getting morals from /their/ book, and can't imagine atheists getting their morals /without/ a book.|`|4S8IKFn0aa	As a Christian I can safely say that most of us don't really care what you do, it's only when you get in our face with you own beliefs that we start to get temperamental.<br>  <br>  (that is not to say that this doesn't go both ways)|`|Pbdqh1lRaa	Anything God does is moral.

dtrYjyYZaa	I don't find it ridiculous in the lest!<br>  My Grandma was a healer as was her Mother and her Grandmother.  My Grandmother kept what she called her recipes in her bible that had been passed down to her from her Grandmother.  Though unknown to me, when I was a child, these recipes were herbal magick.  Does it really matter if the blessings that accompanied them are addressed to God, the Divine or a god/goddess from any number of pantheons?  All that matters is if they work.<br>  <br>  As a child my Grandma would use candles, incense, and many combinations of herbal concoctions. Some of them I have found in modern spell books.  It is my belief that Magick has always been with us it just went by other names.|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	I think the onslaught of hollywood-ized versions of magic is what has harmed real magick. People not raised with magic see these things on the big screen and then assume that is what witches/pagans/naturalists consider to be their magic.|`|cMZEmpp0aa	It's certainly no more ridiculous than the idea of any other family tradition being passed down for decades or centuries. Why doesn't anybody ever complain about the idea of a recipe being handed down from generation to generation? As far as I'm concerned, most of the people who get bent out of shape about this are focusing on the magic part (not the handed down for a century or more part) and are very ignorant about magic, magical practice, or any belief system that isn't their own.|`|fd5f2954d03f8ed32926400fe1b18cfcaa	No, it's not ridiculous at all.

It's been passed on for a long time, and with every person, a little knick or scratch is made. And that reminds us of all the wonderful (and not so wonderful) things it has been through. So I don't think it's ridiculous at all.|`|Tvc6Tmz5aa	A dear friend of mine is Strega (witch from the Tuscany region of Italy). As a little girl in the late 50's, she was sent from elder to elder to be taught their ways. She learned about the Gods and Goddesses, ritual techniques, many different forms of divination, and magic. It has been an ongoing "system' dating back to who knows when. I know that there are those who dismiss The Gospel of Aradia as a purely fictional work but I also know that there is more than a grain of truth to it. Generations have passed down the knowledge and it continues today. My daughter is being taught the "Old Ways" as well as the proper techniques for raising energy and casting spells i.e. magic. Guess there will always be people who pooh-pooh anything that doesn't conform to the tunnel-vision view of the world. So Mote It Be. As for me and mine, we believe because we've experienced enough magical practices to know that it has moved beyond the realm of coincidence and into that of reality.|`|971d3daea9af9b7b15f437ab3cfcc861aa	I don't think it's the thought of knowledge being passed down that is ridiculous.  However, some people claim to have books of shadows that have been passed down for hundreds of years.  That claim is ridiculous because hundreds of years ago, you had to keep it secret that you practiced magick/witchcraft.  They wouldn't have had a book lying around that could be used as proof against them in a witch trial.  <br>  So, the knowledge has been passed down, but not actual texts.  Does this make sense?  Hope it helped.|`|B3qjtZuRaa	It is NOT ridiculous at all.  I think many people in R & S are terribly intimidated by things they don't understand -- that could be the reason they skulk about here!!<br>  <br>  It's not ridiculous.  It's real. As long as YOU know it -- and those who have the ability to SEE know it, too -- why worry about those other dimwits?|`|cECRv4NMaa	I agree with you. It is definitely possible!<br>  For those who think that secrets could never possibly be written down for fear of it being used against them, there are ways of putting things in writing and still pass it down without others knowing what is in those writings. Just a thought. Don't put down others for what they know or believe.|`|Lk4aCBACaa	Some people hear magic, assume witchcraft and (mistakenly) equate that with Wicca, which is only a little over 50 years old. Which is why people should never just assume... ;)|`|dhUm2StSaa	well, yes actually. not so much the time but the "magical knowledge itself".|`|AA10507866	Well this one's obvious.<br>  Everyone knows it's Slinky!

AkFVoQlVaa	Depends on the situation. The first category concerns particular  promises to particular people, not a mandate about how he should act in every possible future scenario. In addition, just because God repents doesn't mean he changes. God is both Flesh and Spirit, linear and nonlinear; his linear aspect may thus act accordingly while his Spirit or universal will remains unchanged.|`|dm8aBiIVaa	Maybe?  :)      :(<br>  <br>  God only repents when he farts out a tornado by accident.|`|85c6832eec366f539d7b941dc3b61894aa	It means that the bible is a man-made work.|`|P5rczL0Saa	We've seen all these before. (sigh) I don't have the strength right now to answer them all. It's too late. Good night.|`|3l6DE1m0aa	This first thing you need to do is consult a Hebrew Bible and see if the same word and concept is even being used in all of those passages and see if "repent" is really the best English concept for all of those passages.  And I can't tell you what the answer is because I don't know.  There may be nothing different, but it's always worth a check.  That is the first thing anyone should do if they feel there is a contradiction in the Bible is to go to a Hebrew (Old Testament) or Greek (New Testament) Bible.  You can probably find these and English study aides for such online.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|F4Wu6JXyaa	It means sometimes God doesn't repent and sometimes he does.  <br>  <br>  What's the problem?  God is three Persons.  Who ever said the Three must agree on everything? <br>  <br>  Look, more seriously: isn't it obvious that creation is constantly changing?  Never stops changing?  Isn't it clear from any reading of scripture that God has changed his mind, and changed his plans, not just once, but many times?  And that he does so to accommodate humanity?  Those who say that God is unchanging have confused 'unchanging' with 'eternal.'   The idea that God is fixed forever is wishful thinking ... and to my mind, rather blasphemous, because it comes from a human desire to cram God into a box of human manufacture.  Well, God can change his mind if he wants; who are we to complain about it?
I3rjYVUFaa	Not at all. What is convieniently left out of this question is the NEXT verse:<br>  <br>  2Ch 4:5  And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths. <br>  <br>  How do you succinctly state the circumference fo something so THICK? It is obvious that these dimensions are APPROXIMATE, since both "cubit" and "handbreath" are APPROXIMATE measurements.<br>  <br>  WHOSE handbreath? WHOSE cubit?<br>  <br>  A "cubit" is the distance from a man's elbow to the end of his middle finger, with the palm flat. Considering men come in different sizes, the term "cubit" MUST be approximate.<br>  <br>  Same with "handbreath." Pi is the ONLY precise term being implied here, and it CAN'T be off more than .1415. The scripture is using general terms, and it is generally and mathematically correct. If you went 3 times the outside diameter of the bowl and scribed a circle using 3 for pi, the circle you scribe would be within a HANDBREATH of of the INSIDE diameter.<br>  <br>  The question attempts to question the infallibility of scripture, and like all other attempts, fails when context is considered.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	The message of the Bible is accurate and inerrant.  God ensured that what He wanted written was written.  But He didn't dictate it.  It was written by imperfect men, using their own hands, minds, vocabularies, etc., and therefore some irregularities in irrelevant trivia are to be expected.  This has no effect on the central message.|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	Sic et Non. If supported by the evidence properly, it can only be proof that this one statement is inaccurate. Every other statement could be true. And though one inaccurate statement may be proved, it does not follow that the rest of the work is garbage..But that's begging the question (Petitio Principii,)...<br>  <br>  The ancient Greeks knew all about Pi. They also knew all about logic. And rhetoric. Very smart people, they were.<br>  <br>  An inaccurate statement does not necessarily mean that other statements are invalid.<br>  <br>  If one statement is invalid, then that means that the specific statement is invalid. It does not necessarily reflect on the validity of other statements.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you would be suffering from a fallacy of generalization (Dicto Simpliciter).<br>  <br>  Obviously, some of the other answerers prefer to exercise Argumentum Ad Hominem, Argumentum Ad Baculum, and Argumentum ad Populum rather than devise a thoughtful answer.<br>  <br>  But, as said, Petitio Principii riddles your question.<br>  <br>  And no, I am no longer beating my wife...|`|AA12059450	Have you ever heard of "SIGNIFICANT DIGITS?"<br>  <br>  For any physical MEASUREMENT, there is a certain inaccuracy, even in modern times.<br>  <br>  We do not know the wall thickness, the "perimeter path," or the point where the "brim" of the object is defined. These variables alone introduce more than enough potential variation to make BOTH statements "true" to the desired level of precision.<br>  <br>  Even in modern times...<br>  If you are in an elementary physics course and find yourself studying the concept of significant digits, you will learn a few basic rules. Pi is a known exact number and can be considered to infinitely many significant digits. The diameter (10) can have either one or two, and we don't really know which from the text. If it is one sig. figure, then 30 would be considered the CORRECT answer for pi * d, even in modern times.|`|PwD3slrTaa	Chronicles is known for rounding off, actually.|`|PvgZUzHjaa	Just one of thousands of examples.|`|eYs8DpbBaa	lol you didn't have to go into that much detail to see there are many contradictions in the bible.|`|tBwdVpG4aa	Dude, you don't have to read that far to realize it's fiction.

In school we would often say pi was 3.14 but this is not completely accurate to be more accurate we would have to carry the decimals further than that.<br>  <br>  "Bible commentator Christopher Wordsworth quotes a certain Rennie, who made this interesting observation regarding the measurements of the molten sea: “Up to the time of Archimedes [third century B.C.E.], the circumference of a circle was always measured in straight lines by the radius; and Hiram would naturally describe the sea as thirty cubits round, measuring it, as was then invariably the practice, by its radius, or semidiameter, of five cubits, which being applied six times round the perimeter, or ‘brim,’ would give the thirty cubits stated. There was evidently no intention in the passage but to give the dimensions of the Sea, in the usual language that every one would understand, measuring the circumference in the way in which all skilled workers, like Hiram, did measure circles at that time. He, of course, must however have known perfectly well, that as the polygonal hexagon thus inscribed by the radius was thirty cubits, the actual curved circumference would be somewhat more.”

You cannot convince someone who believes not to believe, but you can convince someone who doesn't belive how to by being truthful and honest and loving.|`|e599f8e9840310f064e7afa7423bfa60aa	It's not about "okay" or not okay.  Christians are taught to spread the word.  If they don't, they fail their religious obligations.  Atheists follow pretty much nothing (except our common sense), so when we go on the attack, it's more self-serving.  But, I do it all the time.  Every time someone tells me I'm going to hell for not worshiping their gods, I laugh and make a little fun of them.  In truth, though, I feel really bad for them.  They have no real personality, as they spend all of their lives chanting prayers to an imaginary god so that they can be assured a place in heaven.  In the meantime, they are so uptight and angry about those of us that won't join them.  What a waste of life...|`|TgdQ5dQ4aa	Christians pick and choose what they want to believe.

9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	I think abortion and contraception are beneficial to the future of society.  Either because of overpopulation, faulty economics or some combination of the two, humans are currently incapable of providing adequate food, shelter and basic civic servces to at least a billion people.   Correcting our reproductive practices and economic systems will be a slow process.  In the meantime, humanity can benefit from legal accessible abortions and widely practiced contraception just as damage control.|`|osoTq2dcaa	I dont think abortion is right but without contraception there would be a lot more abortions. The only time there should be an abortion is if it would kill the mother during the birth or sometime within the pregnancy. And one other note on abortion for you to think about is .... how can abortion be legal when stem cell research isnt ... think about it ... both arent exactly right|`|QFgzM4APaa	Stem cells offers a vast number of potential applications, including the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of human diseases.<br>  enhance the quality of life and to prolong life among those suffering from a host of human diseases.<br>  <br>  For the religious nuts, the Bible may indeed offer compelling insights and important suggestions for how to navigate today's challenges.<br>  Our world requires difficult decisions and genuinely novel thinking. Only our ability to make choices, especially the most fundamental choices about our own bodies, can guide the way.<br>  <br>  You have to consider the benefits of having the option; not taking the value of choice itself into account is like saying fire insurance is worthless because you will probably never collect any money from your policy.<br>   Such an analysis ignores the huge utilitarian benefit of peace of mind. Fire insurance doesn't just benefit the people who lose their homes, it also improves the lives of the vast majority of policy holders whose homes don't doesn't burn down|`|39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	I don't think either are harmful to society now or in the future.  The opposite would be worse.  Even if a woman uses contraception or has an abortion some time in her life, it does not mean that she hasn't had a child or won't have children in the future.  I really don't think under population should be a concern at this point.|`|qK1iEcVhaa	Nope if you're talking about U.S. because well i have to admit we're horny people lol. And beside most of the abortion that happen tend to me for people who don't want to have baby, so they tend to mistreat the kid which lead to suicide and such. And also having more doesn't mean it will lead to money, most of the time it lead to unemployment.|`|tm2gnYblaa	abortion - yes i think its harmful to society<br>  contraception - no, i don't think its harmful.

But if we fall away from the faith we won't know the difference between the two.<br>  Some like pap(milk) some like the meat. Some like ticking of the ears because if they saw their sin they would deny the truth of the sin.<br>  Joel Olsteen always struck me as a "feel good" preacher.<br>  There are those who are televangelists that preach the uncompromised TRUTH.

Paul Washer is truly the man of God here.  Praise God that even in our depravity, God has made a way, through Christ for our salvation.  I used to like Joel Osteen, because he did speak words that we want to hear.  However,the closer I draw to my blessed Savior, the more I realize Osteen is like the man who speaks what "itching ears" want to hear.  May we live lives that speak the truth in love!|`|k3LbhASGaa	I have one word..... wow|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Washer's classic bent is to make people feel they are evil and deserving of Hell, and it would be laughable except for the fact people actually do feel they are horrible and need salvation. It is nothing less than emotional manipulation, and arguably sociopathic.<br>  <br>  While I feel Osteen is making his money selling good feelings, he is the least offensive evangelist I know. My criticism of Osteen is that he is heavy on the feel-good, and lacking in details.

r6fGmJK1aa	I8 year age difference is not that big of an issue.  Just make sure the Age of Consent in your State makes it legal to have sex. Other wise wait a year for that. <br>  <br>  My partner and I are 25 years apart in age.  Age is just numbers.|`|ErN3pbTeaa	that's just wrong... how do you relate to someone twice your age? It doesn't work.|`|OLpWRv2uaa	Age is only a number after adulthood, say 21+. 17 years old is still a baby and 35 is a nearing middle aged adult. What would these two have in common?

I see nothing wrong with the age gap, except one is not legal to have any sexual encounters with the other yet. <br>  <br>  I say go for it, but keep it clean until the 17 y/o turns 18. <br>  <br>  Love shall overcome a number.

3FUrqYTTaa	Very well respected Rabbis generally wear suit pants with a white shirt and on a colder day suit jacket. On their heads they either wear a black hat or a yumulka. This is more of the attire for a Rabbi that works as a Rabbi of a synagog and being a Rabbi is their job. Other Rabbis have a qualification to be a Rabbi (smicha) but dont work as a Rabbi as their profession. These Rabbis dont always wear suits everyday.<br>  This is just stereotypical. Alot of Rabbis also wear casual clothes.|`|vuAD59egaa	They dress casually at home. They dress professionally when at work.

It does not say that God is a unicorn, but compares His strength to that of a unicorn. (unicorn = rhino, btw.)<br>  <br>  2. The second verse is so far removed from the first that I fail to see how you made any connection at all. It says nothing about unicorns.

cetqJFuBaa	It's not as though I like to be ridiculed, but I do believe that unicorns probably existed at one time.  Job 40 and 41 (read KJV) clearly show two extinct creatures you might recognize.   I don't know how many times the word "dragon" is used in the bible.  Lots of animals are extinct.  Lots of features on animals are no longer showing up.<br>  <br>  There are lots of historical references to dragons and griffins.  Why?  I think they existed in the last two thousand years.  Every paleontologist will tell you that fossils are rare.  Are we so arrogant that we think we know about every animal that has ever lived?  <br>  <br>  I think dragons were related to the t-rex, and griffins were protoceritopses.  Just find a photo of one that isn't completely removed from the dirt (try wikipedia).  The shoulder blade looks like it could be a bone to connect a wing to, but they flip it around when they assemble the displays at museums.<br>  <br>  If only people cared to do their homework on the subject...<br>  Look up:<br>  Ica Stones<br>  Cryptozoology<br>  Puluxy River Tracks<br>  Dragons in art and architecture<br>  <br>  There are many other sources.  So long as you're not committed to the idea that we know everything, a thorough look at the evidence should leave you in no doubt that unicorns were likely to have existed on our planet.|`|cb33f3fcc98eaafaba8a84afddd2bca0aa	The N.I.V. version says, the same but in a different way and the meaning is the same: God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox.<br>  <br>  Meaning: Even though they were in captivity for 400 hundreds years, God brought them out with the strength of an ox. Meaning they were strong.<br>  <br>  All Scriptures are inspired by God. So be careful what one might say!|`|ebe3c2b26459019c836fe0d5e547a974aa	You've got to love the KJV.

In other words it's function is to move you.  And it can possibly move a mind into the wrong direction, example; a 8 year old listening to hard rap music upto to adulthood, "not a pretty picture".

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

The ancient Maya priesthood calculated threw astrology and superstition that this date would mark the end of human consciousness as we know it, not the end of the world, but a new cycle what kind of cycle is interesting. Whats amazing is their scripture also correctly predicted that the War God Quetzacoatl would have pale skin and a black beard--unknown in that part of the world-- and would return on April, 22nd, 1519 and that is the exact day Spanish Conqueor Hernan Cortes landed on the Central American coast. Whats also interesting is the last time this event happened 26 000 years ago our ancestor Cro Magnon man suddenly began creating great art on the cave walls in southern France, which to this day remains one of the most inexplicable and remarkable changes in human history|`|b1XStRqtaa	I just watched a special on the history channel, well part of it as it freaked me out and I turned it off. They were corroborating Nostradamus and the Mayan calendar and others who all predicted that "something" was going to happen in 2012.  Something life altering.  A celestial alignment will occur that only happens every 26, 000 years.  When that happens, the one thing they said was something about the polarity of the earth being reversed and what would happen if that happens.  Total chaos concerning anything with electricity or a magnetic field.<br>  <br>  Boy are we in trouble.

Jesus came unto the world not for those that were whole, but for sinners (in other words, for all of us!)|`|VgC5ip1xaa	I'm not actually a christian, but from what I've gathered, I'd say you need to do the following.<br>  1. Acknowledge that you are a sinner and no amount of good you can do will ever make up for your sinfulness or the sins of your ancestors.<br>  2. Attempt to follow the laws of God and the teachings of Jesus as much as you can, while still bearing in mind that you'll never be up to God's standards.<br>  3. Ask for Jesus to help you overcome temptation and forgive you, despite your sinful nature.<br>  <br>  I personally think this is actually a pretty good set of principles to hold, but I think many of the supposed laws of god are outdated and unnecessary. I think people should be able to follow a similar set of principles in a  secular way. Realise that life is a gift, regardless of whether it was chance, god or anything else that gave it to you, and attempt to be good and help others at all times, but never expect yourself to be perfect. As for forgiveness, I suppose you could replace that with just hoping that you get to keep the gift that is life, even though you can never hope to truly earn something so great.|`|oyvLCy5Caa	You believe in Jesus and in the bible and so do the demons.  That is not enough.  Not that you can earn salvation, I am not saying that.  You cannot go to heaven by praying a magical sinner's prayer or filling out a card at church or even coming down to the altar to make a profession.  <br>  Being a Christian is so much more.  America's churches and gospel is shallow.  It is not the gospel of the bible.  The bible is very clear on how to be born again and find eternal life:<br>  First we must realize that we are spiritually dead in our sins.  There is nothing good in us.  Trying to live a nice life or a good life is not enough.  <br>  You must be totally surrendered to God.  There is nothing you can do to get into heaven.  But with God all things are possible.  Salvation comes from God.<br>  How do we get into heaven? The answer is not, 'God helps those who help themselves'. The answer is not, 'Be a good person'. The answer is not, 'Go to church every Sunday'. <br>  We come as poor, wretched, blind people, who are utterly dependent on the amazing grace of God.<br>  Do you see a time in your life when you repented of your sins and cried out to God to save you?  Do you see a change in your life (born again)?  The bible tells us that when you are born again "old things are passed away, all things are new."  Your life must reflect that of a sanctified Christian.  An immediate sign you are a Christian is that you have a new relationship with sin, You now hate it!  <br>  I don't know what you mean by problems and flaws, a christian is not perfect but we do have victory over sin.  We wage war against sin and do not easily give in.  We strive for holiness and hunger for righteousness.  We are daily being sanctified and made into the likeness of God.  We have fruit in our lives and we also have works that prove we are his children.  <br>  Your statement at the end that states if you were God you would not want yourself in heaven is pretty revealing to your spiritual state.  If you are redeemed and purchased by the blood of Christ you would be relying on Christ's sacrifice to make you justified in the eyes of God instead of what YOU are doing and what YOU have done.  It's about Christ, not you.|`|uJO0MbShaa	Churches prey on those with low self-esteem.<br>  <br>  Take possession of your freedom and consider yourself worthy as everyone else.

AA11047076	What we believe in is euphemistically called "The World to Come". Not much is taught on it (at least not in open sources.) It is not a world as we know it, nor are there beautiful gardens and winged angels playing harps with golden halos around their heads. At the same time- their is no fire and brimstone or eternal damnation and burning in the fires of hell...<br>  <br>  The world to come is a spiritual realm- souls try to cluster around the pure essence of God, to close to the holy for the sake of being near it- because souls yearn to be as close to God as possible. but it is not as simple as that either. The world to come is not a simplistic realm of one level- in the Talmud, Masechta Chagigah, it is said that the outer courtyards to God's abode has seven levels - each of ascending holiness, each soul wanting to be as high as possible. It briefly states that beyond these levels you have the inner courtyard and abode itself- but stops there with the statement "Beyond here we do not enquire". Maybe it elaborates further in the Kaballah- I have no idea on that.<br>  <br>  Hell is completely absent from Judaism. There is no devil in Judaism as it is not possible for an angel to rebel (only humans have free will- angels can only perform specific tasks). What is generally misinterpreted as hell is the concept of Sheol or Gehinnom. This refers to the burning the soul feels at the heavenly trial after death.<br>  <br>  Essentially, we are brought to the heavenly court (God) and judged. Satan (literally the accusser) is the prosecutor and wants to introduce all our sins into the equation. God is merciful, and drops some of the sins before the trial begins (Rambam, Hilchos Teshuvah). After that, the soul basically watches two movies- one is- what your life was- the other, what your life could have been. The soul feels shame at the lost opportunities, at what it could have been vs what it is. It is this shame that feels like an eternity of burning. The burning is not a literal one- it is the burning of shame that it feels at realising how it has transgressed, when it could have been so much more! Think of how, for us with physical bodies, the shame of being shouted at by a parent/teacher/ boss can feel like burning- how much worse for a soul which is a pure being and has no physical imperfections or mental imperfections to give it excuses! But though it states that this "burning" feels like an eternity- it truth, it never lasts for more than 12 months. God is much too loving to give out eternal punishments, just as a loving parent would never punish a child for forever.<br>  <br>  Does this process differ between Jews/non-Jews? Nope- it is exactly the same except Jews (all of them- even apostates that converted to other religions) are judged by the law in the Torah and everyone else by the Seven Noachide laws.<br>  <br>  What happens to particularly evil people? Here we are moving into the territory of those who are punished with kares (spiritual excission). In its most simplistic understanding this means the soul is eternally cut-off from God, unable to enter into the world to come. But what that means is debated with two main answers:<br>  1) The soul dissipates and is destroyed<br>  2) It is forever outside, looking in and regretting its decisions in life.<br>  <br>  Number 2 is the one that has the most support in the Talmud. there is a story of Onkelos, a nephew of Titus and sorceror who summons the souls of three enemies of the Jews to discuss their fates. If they were still around to be summonsed, then they could not have dissipated- ergo number 2 would be correct.. As a side note to this incident, Onkelos repented, converted and became one of the major commentators on the Torah!<br>  <br>  Of course, this is even further complicated by the Jewish view of the soul. In its most simplistic form (yes, it can get a LOT more complicated!) the soul is seen as containing three divisions: 1) the animating spirit which is tied to the physical and dies with the body 2) The "You" part, the intellect etc which is the linkage between the holy and the spiritual and 3) the Holy spark, that bit of God that is within all of us.<br>  <br>  Now the purpose of life is to elevate the holy spark, to bring it even closer to God through the "You" part performing positive deeds and moving towards spirituality and away form the animalistic. As such, it is this part which is judged and has the reward/punishment applied to it. Even if the soul is punished with kares, this would only apply to the "You" part, and not to the holy part.|`|TVJsOEKNaa	By nature people are not inherently all good or all bad, but a combination of the two. Judaism feels that all people end up with the same fate, regardless of religious beliefs (it's part of the reason we don't proselytize). <br>  <br>  There is a system of reward and punishment in Judaism but when one uses the terms Heaven or Hell they are generally referring to Christian concepts.<br>  <br>  The soul is essentially born with a clean slate in life. Like all things in the world, as one ages, they make mistakes and the soul becomes impure as a result. Think of it like an article of clothing that you buy: After lots of wear, the item becomes dirty and needs to be sent to the laundry.<br>  <br>  The same is true for all souls in the world. When one dies, the soul leaves the sensory world and enters "Gehinom (more of a purgatory)." A soul is then purified from its negative actions in life. So you are essentially taking your soul to be cleansed, the way an article of clothing is sent to the laundromat.<br>  <br>  The idea is to have the soul returned to its natural state. After this, the soul enters Gan Eden or the spiritual Garden of Eden. In the Gan Eden the soul enjoys the rays of the Divine Presence.<br>  <br>  There is also the train of thought that a truly wicked soul may be completely destroyed after death.|`|RZetcwalaa	Opinions are mixed, i have included a good article on the topic in the sources.

Knowing this, and that God really does love us, does it make sense to you that He would throw away someone who had not opportunity to make the choice?   <br>  <br>  It makes no more sense to me than the thought that people who are unable to choose because of illness, mental condition, or simply that they are children unable to make an informed choice would be sent to a place of eternal suffering (without God or His influence) just because their brains were not capable of following the steps to salvation.|`|pFs71HsHaa	That is not a question that any human should answer.

Do you have any preference to exactly where overseas?<br>  <br>  2. What areas of interest do you have?<br>  <br>  3. Are you religious?<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: If you're Lutheran then I would recommend talking to your pastor about going overseas to do missionary work. It would go perfect with your desire to teach; that was why I asked if you were religious. If doing missionary work isn't your thing you think or if your not that much "into" religious teachings; than I'm sure they need volunteers to do charitable work  in other countries, such as serving food, simple medical work, or whatever. Every church has their won programs. By the door of most churches there are pamphlets and brochures that tell about your churches programs , what they do, and what countries help is needed; and of course you can talk to your pastor.

Yuan was Actually a Mongol Empire with Chinghes Khan empire <br>  <br>  Because Mongolian Empire ruled Tibet & China in the past, How does this give China the right to rule Tibet? <br>  Since British Empire ruled Hong Kong, India, and many many other Country, does that give Hong Kong the Right to rule India?<br>  No, absolutely NOT !<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.asiaquarterly.com/content/view/34/1/" rel="nofollow">http://www.asiaquarterly.com/content/vie...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.studentsforafreetibet.org/article.php?id=422" rel="nofollow">http://www.studentsforafreetibet.org/art...</a>|`|vquwiGegaa	How do you like Louisiana territory independent form USA, Normandy independent from France, and Wales’s independent from England?<br>  <br>  The territory of Tibet has always been with China since after "Tang Dynasty" of China, around 800 AD at least. For a brief period of 4 kings of Tibet- they were a force to be reckoned with in North West Territory of China. <br>  <br>  That was only happened when Tang took power from previous "Sui Dynasty", and for the fifty years the wars raged in China. So they have conquered some of the Sui Dynasty and Han Dynasty territories and made it the greater Tibet Dynasty.<br>  <br>  The First two Emperors of Tang were too busy to settle internal struggle to care a territory with few citizens.<br>  <br>  After the Fourth Kings for the brief period of 120 years, they were destroyed by Mongols, and then the Mongol rule were disrupted by another Mongol princedom destroyed the previous one and let Tibetan went Autonomous under a Governor's rule. (At current size of Tibet territory).<br>  <br>  Hence the rise of power of Kagyupa, Shakyapa, and finally under another Mongol prince, the Gelugpa gain control of Tibet and became Semi-Independent, yet a territory of Mongols (year around 1100 AD). This princedom later conquered China<br>  <br>  During the Yuen Dynasty (Mongol Ruled China) starting 1271 AD, Tibet officially for the third time incorporated into China again. Dai Lai Lama was given the title of "Dalai Lama" during this period, and must be approved by the Emperors of China every incarnation to assume the title began around this period.<br>  <br>  During Qing Dynasty (1644 -1911), China divided Tibet into Front Tibet to be ruled by Dalai Lama, and Back Tibet by Panchen Lama as Autonomous states of China, Qing Dynasty just have a Governor and a small arm force send from Peking (today's Beijing).<br>  <br>  During many of the power struggled and internal strides, Dalai had ousted many Tibetans, and they move into China territories, and Chinese never rejected any one race to move in so long as they are content with the Government.<br>  <br>  For the brief period of two wars in China, (1) WWII, when Japan invaded China; and toward the end of the WWII, for a brief period Dalai Lama declared independent from China (this lasted two years). (13th Dalai Lama)<br>  <br>  (2) When Nationalist China was beaten by Communist China, Tibetan again declared Independent from China with the verbal promised support from England and India. (This lasted one year). The rest is known history for the West. (14th Dalai Lama.)<br>  <br>  Now Dalai Lama with support from the West, mainly CIA and England's Secret Services, wanted China to declare the provinces of Tibet, provinces of Qinghai (Khams is part of Qinghai, East Khams was once recognized as governing territory of Dalai), Xinjiang, Gansu, Yunnan, and Sichuan traditionally part of China; and remove all Citizens from these territory including Han Chinese, Muslim, plus 50 some minority races from the territory- their traditional historical homes, as a free Tibet, and then now they want this declared a new autonomous territory under Dalai Lama’s rule? <br>  <br>  They want their Grandeur of their previous empire, during the first 50 years of Tang period of China, a dream will never fulfilled; and without outside influence, Dalai Lama would have returned to Tibet and be happy with just the province of Tibet.<br>  <br>  The idea of greater Tibet is a hope for a step toward future independent state, a secret wish for all the major powers in the world, except Chinese Government is not that stupid, China will risk any war including Nuclear wars plus half of its population to defend these territories. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nysun.com/news/foreign/tibets-territory-claim-reaches-well-china" rel="nofollow">http://www.nysun.com/news/foreign/tibets...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Tibet" rel="nofollow">http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entr...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  -----------<br>  <br>  Deluded one, <br>  <br>  Check what every great Lama did when Chinese Emperors summons them from Sung, Yuen, Ming, Qing Dynasties, all the way to Republic of China and Peoples' Republic of China in modern day, to go to China see them? <br>  <br>  As matters of facts, in both Kagyupa, and Shakyapa, aside from Dalai and Panchen Lamas (was officiated in Qing Dynasty) of Gelugpa, the heads and their number two and three Lamas have also received Titles from Chinese Emperors, and they still using the same titles today, If it does not bring prestige and meant something, why use it?<br>  <br>  And yes, the Mongols gave Dalai the right to rule as Governor, but check what happened after Ming Dynasty assumed the power in China; and what happened when Qing Dynasty assume the right to rule, and Republic of China, and so on until the Communists took over China? This is the "Right of Successions" as recognized in World Political arena.<br>  <br>  Every Head of any sect. when accenting the lineage throne must confirmed with Chinese Emperors since Sung Dynasties. It was finally became official in Emperor K'ang Hsi in Qing Dynasty with the direct control by using the Golden Vases or Jinbonba (Golden Lottery Urn), one in Lhasa and another in Peking /Beijing, to determine the selection when multiple matches were found.<br>  <br>  Also check the Plaques in temples and check historical records, what happened whenever, Mongols, Nepalese, Bhutanese, and Ladhakhs invaded Tibet, who and which country came to rescue?

I distrust the accuracy of it as the motives to paint the Chinese in a bad light are quite strong.<br>  <br>  I was reading a story today about how Obama was complaining about the Chinese navy harassing a US mapping vessel that was mapping the undersea floor in the South China Sea. The Americans even admitted that they were mapping the sea floor to make it easier for their submarine fleet to move around. The South China Sea is the equivalent of what the Gulf of Mexico is to the USA. Can you imagine how the Americans would have reacted if a Chinese vessel was mapping the undersea floor in the Gulf of Mexico?

So to prove you are the moral one and he wasn't, which is going to be very difficult. <br>  Lastly, since God made the rules and is the judge, it is going to be really really difficult to expect him to judge himself, especially since he, in his sight, is perfect. <br>  If, however, you use the behaviour of some Christians as a standard in which you endeavour to exceed, then that is different. Even Jesus said it was important to do what the Pharisees said but don't behave as they do.|`|82oTjLCAaa	if the world has parts of immorality, amorality, it doesn't mean that the Creator is imorall or amorall.remember that God flooded the world and saved just Noah and his family.and God sent fire over Sodom and gomora.even if it happen that the people around are sinfull, it doesn't mean the Creator is imorall. Don't jump at conclusions, be reasonable, and ask other and other man about it.try to stay among the moral friends and avoid the imorall..you will see that not all think the same..and other thinks right.while some think imorall, if from them just one think right it could look the one who thinks right is wrong.then don't jump at conclusion..don't hurry to say he/she is wronmg i did so an i regreted..i had to apologise.so ask another one how is right to be and ask a priest and then other and other..untill you get the answer that it is right to you..becAUSE THE TRUTH COMES AT OIL AT SURFACE, AND THE MAN NEEDS THE FREEDOME OF TRUTH AND OF HEART AND OF THE MORALITY..Tthe man is free only in morality..because we are asked to be moral from childhood, so from history..and the morality doesn't change because it comes from God.so stay by morality..God won't deny it..will sustain it.|`|fM7yNf8oaa	It certainly should. "God made you, so whatever he does is right", is a terrible belief to have. If a god created us, he is responsible for us. He can't escape that responsibility, and only a bully would pawn it off of his own creation when things go awry.|`|wXaCGj7Saa	Yes. But that's why some have to believe in absolutes. For instance, if there is a God, He has to be absolutely good. If my God is absolutely evil, I can rebel, or I can choose to go along with his master plan. You see, it's all part of the plan.|`|ExQGD2uwaa	You're going to give God lessons in morality?  Absurd.

How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself originated; but I may remark that, as some of the lowest organisms, in which nerves cannot be detected, are capable of perceiving light, it does not seem impossible that certain sensitive elements in their sarcode should become aggregated and developed into nerves, endowed with this special sensibility.<br>  <br>  Charles Darwin,<br>  Origin of Species, Ch. 6, p144|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	People will point out to you how he used this quote, which does not support creationism at all.<br>  <br>  I will point out to you that evolution is a fact based on evidence, not the authority of Darwin or anyone else.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	I believe we were created by God.

On the following day, file a lawsuit against your school for their epic failure to teach you anything worthwhile.<br>  <br>  Ursid: Your alleged knowledge of science hasn't affected your belief in impossible things (like creationism, intelligent design, the unscientific Bible, etc.).

I say, "I don't believe any gods exist." But I'm exceedingly confident about that statement and if pressed I would feel fine about saying "There are no gods." But if you are going to take issue with atheists saying "There is no God." then I assume you also take exception with theists saying "There is a God." because it assumes the same assuredness.|`|LF2t9DPZaa	You are confusing disbelief with lack of belief.<br>  <br>  Atheism means a lack of belief in gods. Atheists do not say "I believe that there is no god"; we say "I do not believe that there is a god." Do you understand the difference? If not, don't bother reading the rest of this.<br>  <br>  It's true, of course, that we don't know for certain that there isn't a god. We don't know for certain that there aren't dragons or leprechauns either. But since there is no observable evidence that dragons or leprechauns exist, we conclude that they don't, at least until more evidence is found. You have applied this principle to things like dragons, leprechauns, the Tooth Fairy, and all the gods worshiped by religions you don't follow. Why shouldn't we apply it to your god too?|`|qEYYHNyyaa	Absence of evidence is the very definition of non-existence.|`|TLLklriUaa	Actually I say there is absolutely no proof for the existence of any gods.

Most atheists make no claim to know there is no God. We lack belief in deities. Rather like you lack belief in fairies, but cannot claim to *know* there are no fairies. If you want to argue that we shouldn't lack belief in anything that we don't know for a fact does not exist, you have a bit of a problem in your hands, since you must accept that any concept you can possibly come up with exists unless proven otherwise.|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	Most atheists do not make such absolute statements.<br>  <br>  "There is probably no gold in China."<br>  <br>  See? Problem solved.  By adding the limitation "probably," you don't have to be intimately familiar with every square inch of Chinese soil, you just have to be aware of the fact that the conditions under which gold is produced or transported do not exist in China.  Same goes with God.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  You're wrong.  Absence of evidence is evidence of absence.  There is a difference between "evidence" and "proof".  For example, there is a complete absence of evidence that Santa Claus actually exists.  Is that fact itself evidence that Santa Claus does not exist?  Do you need to be omniscient to say there is no Santa Claus?|`|MXYWSsM7aa	Well, they can claim it but they don't really know it neither do they have proof that He doesn't exist. They say the same thing about the believer but the atheist has never had an experience that validates His existence the way we have. The natural man receiveth not  the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned. I Cor. 2:14. As long as their hearts are hardened and they're in continual denial then they will never receive it. Sad isn't it?<br>  Thanks and God Bless. :)|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	You are mistaken.<br>  <br>  All someone has to do to be an atheist is to not have beliefs in god/s.

0fRsWy05aa	Yes. I have seen Asian and other women of color go blonde.  If you like that color, go for it. @~|`|4sh2oRR7aa	They can. It just looks horrible and unnatural.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Sure but it'll look unnatural.....|`|pxf9LwQJaa	Yes you can, why you would want to is another question.<br>  It would take multiple dye jobs, go to a very good salon and they will have to bleach you hair to almost a white shade and then apply the blonde color to it. Some salons will skip this step and intstead of a true blonde your hair will be an orange color. My opinion is that a true blonde does not look right on any dark skin tone whether it be an asian or hispanic woman. It usually looks harsh and ugly like this: <a href="http://theybf.com/index.php/2009/03/02/foolywang-material-christina-milian-attacked-by-bottle-of-bleach/" rel="nofollow">http://theybf.com/index.php/2009/03/02/f...</a><br>  If you are on the fair side of black you may be able to carry it off like this woman: <a href="http://www.cutiecentral.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/keyshiacole-bethonors.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.cutiecentral.com/blog/wp-cont...</a> <br>  But I suggest you stick with more of an amber blonde with a reddish undertone like this:<br>  <a href="http://badhairday.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/christina_milan.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://badhairday.typepad.com/photos/unc...</a><br>  Or better yet a Get a short edgy cut die it rockstar black like this: <a href="http://www.missxpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/kelis.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.missxpose.com/wp-content/uplo...</a><br>  and then if you want tell your stylist to add in bright pops of color, like electric blue or bright red use extensions for this, so can change the color when the mood suits you and you don't damage hair with a dye job.|`|fjsczTsMaa	Sure, why not? Ignore all the others who say you can't; it's your hair and you can do what you damn well want with it!<br>  <br>  I want blue hair, but I can't have it because of my bf.|`|EXurNsB4aa	If they want to, sure.|`|eoxx8KKPaa	I think yes, to bleach the hair first then dye blond, better do it in the salon.<br>  <br>  I found black and gold is always a perfect match, so black people in golden color fashions, eye glasses and jewellery look really gorgeous, however, blond hair just doesnt go well with black people, I dont know why.<br>  <br>  You may try once and see what your friends' comments are on the new color.|`|5tVSnJKEaa	can you?

e3PWZYsAaa	Salam,<br>  <br>  Bukhari<br>  <br>  Volume 7, Book 70, Number 573:<br>  <br>  Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:<br>  <br>  When Allah's Apostle was on his death-bed and in the house there were some people among whom was 'Umar bin Al-Khattab, the Prophet said, "Come, let me write for you a statement after which you will not go astray." 'Umar said, "The Prophet is seriously ill and you have the Qur'an; so the Book of Allah is enough for us." The people present in the house differed and quarrelled. Some said "Go near so that the Prophet may write for you a statement after which you will not go astray," while the others said as Umar said. When they caused a hue and cry before the Prophet, Allah's Apostle said, "Go away!" Narrated 'Ubaidullah: Ibn 'Abbas used to say, "It was very unfortunate that Allah's Apostle was prevented from writing that statement for them because of their disagreement and noise." <br>  <br>  Peace.|`|UhyvM73iaa	Allah revealed Surah 49. Al-Hujrat  in the same year Surah An-Noor was revealed. It was 4th or 5th years after Prophet moved to city of Madina. Prophet died in the 10th year.  No one yelled at Prophet at his death time.<br>  <br>  Allah has tried to teach Bedoins of desert who were not civilized enough and did not know the proper mannes to talk to Prophet of God. So God tries to teach Muslims good manners and how to talk to Prophet of Allah.<br>  <br>  God had completed revealing last Ayahs of Quran  months before Prophet died.  No one yelled at Prophet at the time of his death. Only his wives were around him. After he died, first man who entered in his room was Abu Bakar because he was father of Prophet's Aesha.  Hazrat Ali could also enter in Prophet's room being son in law of Prophet.  No any other companion of Rasoolallah could enter in his one room house.<br>  As soon as news spread about death of Prophet, all Muslims came and were standing or sitting  by his house or were gathering inside the Masjid which was less than 10 feet from Prophet's room.|`|SpSnRor6aa	your an ex sunni.....interesting
PS91d0wvaa	It bothers me as well, I have been atheist for a very long time, before I even knew what it meant. I never had beliefs in such things as god or religion for that matter. In a way, you can say that people who believe in this sort of stuff are "needy" and weak minded. they are never completely satisfied with what they have or how much love they need and want. I think it's strange that we as atheists respect religions such as christianity and catholic by celebrating things like christmas and they cannot respect our scientific meaning of the world. You should go online and watch a movie called Zeitgeist. You can find it on ovguide.com, you will enjoy every minute of it, and get a better understanding of your question, and why our world is ruled my religion. It is simple to brainwash weak minds with things like an idea of god. Keep your head up and take care!|`|DYmmUSt1aa	YOu have a point.<br>  I'd like to believe everyone has some sort of moral system though and thats mainly what runs our society.<br>  <br>  its hard to differentiate morality and religion|`|xrl96EHTaa	No, religion is just given special sympathy.|`|8QhmY8TEaa	In the olden days, they used religion as a means of power to control people. "Do this or the great lord will punish you" type of things. <br>  Just last night i was reading about vampires, In Russia people were scared of vampires, and becoming vampires, and it was said if you didn't do what the church told you to do, you would become a vampire when you died.<br>  <br>  Wars have been started, millions of people have died because of religion, because people want power. and they used the power of religion because it made people scared.<br>  <br>  <br>  Fear is a great motivator|`|hKJIDdVqaa	Our world is ruled by satan.....for now.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	If you substitute "full" for "ruled" I would agree. Our language and culture is saturated with religious terminology and quite often we are not aware of it.<br>  <br>  In Spanish, for example "gracias" means "grace" and it is not uncommon for people to say "ave Maria" as their equivalent the the English "oh my god."<br>  <br>  So long as you can identify it as you encounter it and just be aware of it you should be able to navigate ok.
2TXCaLWraa	GOOD THING, VERY GOOD THING!!<br>  <br>  when i sleep over at my Gf's house i don't need 2 bring anything...lol...we have the same shoe size, jean size ND shirt size...+ I love it when she wears my clothes...i don't know y but i just do...^_^|`|yXg1ojQoaa	it's totally awesome! seriously, double-wardrobing is like on the top ten list of reasons to date the same sex! Idk why but my girlfriend LOVES wearing my clothes, even though theyr'e a little big or her.( she is an AUS size 6 and i'm an AUS size 10)  I don't really often wear her clothes though, unless it's like a hoody or something.mostly because of the size thing. I asked er wy she wears mine though, even though theyre slightly too big, she said it's because they smelt like me! i wasn't even aware i had a smell :)<br>  well, wish you the best!<br>  Kasey|`|oDdXpghDaa	hahaha, you sound like Shontelle - "With nothing but your t-shirt on....."<br>  <br>  No, but seriously, my ex and I were the same size and we borrowed stuff from each other all the time.  <br>  <br>  I think it's cute ;)  Girls borrow their boyfriend's hoddies and t-shirts and boxers to sleep in all the time - why not 2 boyfriends?|`|FpMS47sXaa	my partner and I do this.<br>  <br>  he's a bit larger than I am (but who isn't), so we don't share pants or jeans.

The only real down side is a height or size difference between the two. My husband and I wear the same T-Shirts and some polos, but the waredrobe swap ends there. I'm 6-4 and he's 5-10, so we're pretty much using our own clothes everywhere else. I like the smell of him on clothes (a shirt or something). That always makes me smile.<br>  <br>  Now, I do find it cute when he puts on my size 14 flip-flops (he's a 10) to run outside real quick or something. ;) Like a little kid wearing dad's shoes. lol|`|m4vBLZ7haa	Yup, I do agree. That scenario is awful appealing. <br>  The sad thing is, I think my clothing might be a tad too small(generally small/medium clothing for me).

aU399em7aa	If you wrote, "Damage to government buildings and to some residential areas has been devastated," then it would be the same as saying, "Damage has been devastated."<br>  <br>  So written the correct way it would be the same as, "Damage has been devastating."<br>  <br>  In this sentence the word "devastating" describes ( adjective ) the damage.<br>  <br>  If you wanted the correct useage of the word devastated then the sentence would have to read, "Government buildings and some residential areas have been devastated."<br>  <br>  Yes, devastating acts as an adjective.|`|KAPakAh9aa	Devastated would be considered past tense, as in it already happened. Devastating is describing the damage to some residential areas and the government buildings. However in the sentence, the people were "devastated" over the damage to the buildings. The word devastated describes how the people are feeling.|`|ZHZU8w0Caa	yes. it is an adjective.<br>  <br>  the damage was devastating.<br>  <br>  NOT<br>  the damage was devastated, that wouldnt make any sense.<br>  <br>  you might be thinking that the buildings were devastated, but that is not what the sentence is grammatically saying. It is saying that the damage TO the buildings was devastating.<br>  <br>  VVVVV wow that answer is retarded. devastating is an adjective here, please dont get confused. the clause HAS BEEN is the verb here. devastating can never be a verb, a gerund (-ing) can NEVER be a verb.<br>  thank you godesspirit.<br>  shrapnel, you are equally retarded as a peanut|`|jmgLiPS2aa	It is 'devastating' because the sentence is in the present progressive tense. Devastating here is not an adjective, its a verb. Adjectives describe a noun or pronoun, verbs show action. Devastating here is the action.

511e8b445adfad2d427229e044071fa1aa	I saw that. I think people are becoming less and less obligated and connected with religion for a few reasons. <br>  <br>  1. Their parents aren't religious. Many people are religious because of their parents, and alot of people are growing weary of faith or have become very well educated and are rejecting the ideals of religion all together not passing it on to their  children. <br>  <br>  2. People are leaving their places of worship for numerous reasons, we're working more, we've phased religion out of our lives completely in some parts. Most of my friends believe in god, but do not go to church and then there are some of us who are spiritual but are against organized religion, feels like organized crime.|`|a6eb6e311bd16dad988d64e4f060d69faa	That 15% aren't all atheists.

For too long, religion has served as a means to control people's thinking and provide answers based on faith, not on reason.

Understandably, religious hierarchies cannot survive unless there is a hierarchy.  Question authority and do not believe everything you think.  There is so much wonder out there, and what do we get?

d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	Our dog just died unexpectedly last Tuesday. It hurts, he was a big part of this family, but at the same time I personally have dealt with worse (suicide of someone at the age of 27), so even if this hurts I've known harder pain so it's not quite as bad as that was. (My father on the other hand is probably having the hardest time with it.) I believe the pain of a pet loss is just as bad as that of a human.<br>  <br>  A pet afterlife.. well we'll just have to see. Maybe this dog will give us a sign. lol|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Some people's pets are their children, and losing one is every bit as painful as losing a child. My cat Louisa was 23 when she died. She had been part of my life for so many years. After she died, I just held her and cried for at least half an hour. Years later, I still miss her.<br>  <br>  I sincerely hope that all the pets I love will be in the afterlife. It just won't seem like heaven without cats!|`|HEDSOHq1aa	pain, yes<br>  there is no afterlife for anything alive, if you die, you cease existing|`|APjnSYKuaa	It depends on how close I was to the pet... of course, the same goes for people.<br>  <br>  And why should pets have an afterlife when we don't?|`|Y6odIQgJaa	Yes & yes.<br>  <br>  Google "Rainbow Bridge" for some comfort on this subject.|`|DArAz67Caa	no-----I don't have any pets----my husband has a cat-----but I'm not fond of him-|`|QhnsPDxfaa	I had a friend, he was half German Shepard, half St. Bernard and he knew my moods, my feelings.

7oCpSkmxaa	Jehovah's Embroidery<br>  <br>  When I was a little boy, my mother used to embroider a great deal. I would sit at her knee and look up from the floor and ask what she was doing. She informed me that she was embroidering. I told her that it looked like a mess from where I was. As from the underside I watched her work within the boundaries of the little round hoop that she held in her hand, I complained to her that it sure looked messy from where I sat. <br>  <br>  She would smile at me, look down and gently say, "My son, you go about your playing for a while, and when I am finished with my embroidering, I will put you on my knee and let you see it from my side." <br>  <br>  I would wonder why she was using some dark threads along with the bright ones and why they seemed so jumbled from my view. A few minutes would pass and then I would hear Mother's voice say, "Son, come and sit on my knee." <br>  <br>  This I did only to be surprised and thrilled to see a beautiful flower or a sunset. I could not believe it, because from underneath it looked so messy. Then Mother would say to me, "My son, from underneath it did look messy and jumbled, but you did not realize that there was a pre-drawn plan on the top. It was a design. I was only following it. Now look at it from my side and you will see what I was doing." <br>  <br>  Many times through the years we may have asked our heavenly Father what was happening to our lives, and how to make sense of it. As we progress in understanding of his Fatherly and compassionate nature, we in time come to understand that what seems unclear to us from the underside, is beautifully taking form on the other. The dark threads may seem jumbled and a mess, and we are inclined to develop a negative attitude in our life, despite our Fathers comforting assurances. Yet with a confident faith in the final state of Jehovah's will and purpose accomplished, we will be permitted to see the "top" side of the embroidery, when "all things are made new" (Rev. 21:5)|`|X548yCR6aa	So, what -was- the reason she didn't want him to see the picture?<br>  <br>  Or answer any questions, while we're at it? Was there even a mother or did the child just suffocate under that rug and was seeing things before his brain shut down?

e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	After graduation, I went through a lot of growing and changes. I was a completely different person when I went to my 10 year high school graduation. Although we talked about high school days, it did not in the least feel as if we were still high school buds. <br>  It felt as if we all spent time on different planets and nothing was the same. <br>  Class beauties were now plain ladies with realistic life problems. High school dweebs were suddenly handsome men with promising careers. Stories of marriages, divorces, children, etc. made us very different people than the crowd we knew ten years before. <br>  Time changes things, including how people interact. Sure, there will always be the few who refuse to grow up and think they could just pick up where they left off, but they usually face the rude awakening that those around them have grown past those times and going back to those times is not an option.
cXXJVz64aa	Babies are born innocent until their parents poison them with religion, or tell the facts of Atheism.|`|wXaCGj7Saa	I believe that babies are inherently good. Here's my proof: Why would a loving, caring God send a baby to Hell for something it's parents did if it died in infancy? (I've heard, and in fact, was brought up under this teaching). Eventually, they reach an age where they know right from wrong, and what they do from there on out determines where they go when they die.|`|AA10790957	Definition of sin<br>  <br>   1 John 3:4   Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. <br>  <br>  its hypocrite to think that infants have sin. lol|`|FOZGMadaaa	Psalm 51.

Sin of the parents or the environment of the parents.<br>  _______<br>  By the way it is born "into sin" and not "In sin".  Also the birth is not the first birth like from the womb, but a spiritualy birth. Hence the born again christian.|`|3a3e942c6ad42563faecc58bad4ee235aa	Jesus said unless we become innocent as children we cannot enter heaven.  If they were full of sin, this would not be true.<br>  A child does not sin until it is capable of knowing the difference in right and wrong.  Sin is forgiven only in Christ.  To be in Christ one must first believe Jesus is the son of God, repent of their sins and confess Jesus is the Christ before he can have his sins washed away in the grave of baptism.  A child cannot do this.  It is impossible.  They are totally innocent until capable of knowing the difference.|`|d9fb2acd20fb4c3590182dc9f4470d89aa	I think you are expressing a misunderstanding of the nature of original sin.<br>  The teaching of original sin as I understand it is simply that every person is born with an innate predisposition towards sin and rebellion.<br>  God does not judge you according to your nature. God judges you according to your actions.<br>  Nevertheless once one reaches the age of moral accountability and chooses to sin, they are answerable to God for their actions.<br>  But if you doubt the truth of this, just ask yourself if a child ever needs to be taught to lie.<br>  They figure it out quite well all by themselves.|`|AA11399548	Just as this world is no bastion of purity, neither are any of us when we come into it. We have "done" nothing wrong, but we will. We have a nature that accompanies our flesh. This isn't the same as saying babies are immediately ushered into hell if they die, it's only saying that they will sin when given opportunity. That is what necessitated Christ's coming. We couldn't get out of our lame predicament, but he could do something to make us acceptable. We come to heaven on Christ's coat tails. Every one of us. Even babies.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	It is called original sin, which means that the infant is not yet an heir to eternal life in heaven.|`|PwD3slrTaa	Every true religion does.

nT0w6VIKaa	Actually, the 'trolls' are REALLY gay people who have been brainwashed and find themselves EXTREMELY UNHAPPY...REALLY!  Psychologically speaking, people who are so blatantly upset about gay people and go out of their way to be offensive are usually either gay themselves and just trying to throw the blame on to someone else...or...they are, at least, minimally insecure in their own sexuality...  It's a PSYCHOLOGICALLY proven FACT!|`|AA11589320	Dear Neil S<br>  <br>  If homosexuality is such a serious sin that deserves the attention that it gets from today's church,  why does is receive so little attention in the bible.  <br>  <br>  Be objective.  <br>  Take two bibles.  From one remove the pages that talk about bad homosexual behaviour.   Next hold both bibles in each hand above your head and and try to determan by weight which one has homosexuality still in it.<br>  <br>  Now lets reverse the test.<br>  This time lets remove all the pages that talk about bad heterosexuality. <br>  <br>  Holding them above the head, even someone whos arm is asleep could pick the reduced bible.  <br>  <br>  This shows that in reality its heterosexuality that was of greater concern when the bible was being written.   In fact homosexuality only managed a half dozen paragraphs.|`|XuUMXQ8Naa	I think the trolls are hilarious, they are just so funny, we always have a giggle about them.<br>  I think it only upsets people if you actually believe what they say and we don't!<br>  But its rather ironic to think of Niel going back to his church and them saying what did you do all morning and him saying <br>  "Well I was answering questions on the glts section of YA all morning!"<br>  He must get some funny looks!|`|3OZgcntfaa	I don't think trolls have a faith... they just sort of like to spout off traditionally "anti-gay Christian" slogans. <br>  <br>  Real Christians have better things to do than to spread hate.<br>  <br>  I don't watch Las Vegas, sorry.|`|7U0hQ1VPaa	It's fun to make fun of them and make them feel like stupid pieces of feces|`|m2PlMByKaa	man this section is very isolated around this time huh?|`|NMaCcyeKaa	There's no point to making a special section for the trolls.

Just read your book. Its not very fair isnt it?|`|jg1pbV5Xaa	A truely loving God does not really care about your so called religion, God cares about YOU and how you lived your life, what you did and why you did it. That why is rather important, mistakes and bad results are still pointed out to the soul. A good soul can come from any group just as bad souls can hide in any group. God knows the difference. Belief in Christ is not the only way into heaven no matter what we are told. Think about all those pedifile priests that believed in Christ, their belief in Christ is not going to fool God, Jews that believed in God and were good people are much more likely to be favoured by God than those who abused their positions despite their belief in Christ,|`|D8sN8gNFaa	Why would a God ( Whose love is "supposed to be" unconditional), send a person to hell who has already suffered something they didn't deserve, or just couldn't bring themselves to believe something because they actually had a different opinion about the world. If he did, he wouldn't be 2 things.<br>  <br>  He wouldn't be God<br>  And his love wouldn't be unconditional<br>  <br>  <br>  Sending Jews (or anybody) to hell for that reason or any other would make God a Sadist.|`|PwD3slrTaa	Yes.  Very simple.<br>  <br>  John 3:18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.|`|yu53u5TFaa	According to Christianity, none of them did because they were Jews.<br>  <br>  Great belief system.

As long as you have faith in God, thats all that matters.<br>  <br>  Im sure those people who lost faith in God in the end, had to suffer some way. Nothing brutal. They would have had to make up for whatever they did, in the beyond, aka the after life, and eventually, after they learn, they will go into a higher place, much like heaven.<br>  <br>  Thats what I believe anyway.|`|ZFGNNeJnaa	Believe me, you don't have  Christian to go to heaven, all you need to do is accept that there is a God and believe in his scriptures and prophets. Besides, many ancient scriptures foretell the coming of many prophets such as Jesus and Muhammed. Check this out if you want to see where Muhmmed and Jesus are prophesied in the Hindu Scriptures: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/nvkashraf/claims-crit/md-jesus.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/nvkashraf/claim...</a><br>  Anyway back to the question, if the Jew had a good heart and still kept his/ her faith in God during there times of torture and pain then God would of forgiven their sins and sent them straight to heaven.<br>  Good luck on your answer mate|`|wXaCGj7Saa	The only requirement to go to Heaven is stated in Romans 10:9; "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord [is] Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved." So, for the Jews who did believe this, they are now in Heaven. For the ones who didn't, they are not in Heaven.|`|G4SVG7tKaa	To equate Jewish belief in the afterlife with the Christian one is an exercise in ignorance and stupidity.

You can't be as stupid as your religion is, now, can you? Or can you?<br>  <br>  Why pick on me? Is kstonely (below) saying that you are crap because you're a Christian?

And there are those who really are great people who give great advice, Islamically and otherwise.<br>  <br>   It just shows how different we can all be, despite the fact that we believe in the same (or very similar) things.<br>  <br>  Despite certain people's unfriendliness I think most people seem like genuinely nice people :)<br>  <br>  I think that this section should be taken seriously to an extent, what I mean by that is that we should consider what we say, because many non-Muslims or impressionable young Muslims (like myself :P) can think things about Islam that are not necessarily true, I don't think we set the best example, but over all, it just shows that Muslims are pretty normal people, it's just I don't think many people consider this when asking  and answering questions....<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, every Muslim here should be aware that our actions, online included, are being counted, and it's up to them how they act with this information in mind <br>  <br>  Salam sis x|`|Xjekjqmqaa	Sometimes, When someone asks the punishments and things that generally non-believers hate, Muslims tend to think those people are trolls. I’ve seen countless Muslims who are interested in knowing the reasons for different punishments. But people tend to label them as trolls. I am not saying there aren’t any, but, be careful about judging a person by a question.<br>  <br>  But I like this section very very much. I find it a section like a home to Muslims. And the, what you people may call, very random or stupid questions is not necessarily a bad thing. It’s kind of sending the message that Islam and Muslims isn’t all about the Qur’an and hadiths, but about everyday things, problems, fun or sad news, topics. It’s made of everything, and it is nice Muslims here in the Ramadan section are asking a mix of questions that symbolize everything – our lives.<br>  <br>  I do think that Muslims here in Ramadan section need to co-operate more on answering questions on the R & S section and spread the Da’wah. It’s a shame because it looks like they are hiding and are too scared to answer some brain-twisting questions.

That's so sad people just don't pay respect to Qur'anic verses and thumbs down.<br>  <br>  A healthy constructive discussion is always good to put forward truthful and honest opinion but even then people bash, slander and even do not forgive smallest mistakes and start calling "Hypocrite".

Bad questions and answers, some bad users, but overall not bad in itself.<br>  <br>  Reason being that if someone comes here with the understanding they're going to have to sift through a lot of crap in order to find the useful info, they might actually find some that is useful. <br>  <br>  Maybe that is not the case for someone who has followed Islam all their life, but for someone without a clue (like me), it is nice to occasionally hear real peoples opinions, and not have to find them amongst the seemingly millions of websites out there.<br>  <br>  Not a good place to find out how muslims behave though. I like the debates that go on within some questions, as I'm genuinely interested in the whys that cause people to choose a certain path, but some of the things said are a big turn off. I see a lot of people who claim they're only trying to get the truth across and spread the "right" path. Unfortunately though, a lot of those people (who may or may not have valid points) are worth ignoring simply on the basis of their lack of respect and maturity. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't call this place a good example for Islam either. Though honestly, I'm not sure I'd say any internet forum is a good example for any religion. There's too much room for those who represent it poorly to bring everyone else down. <br>  <br>  For someone whose intention is to learn something, they might find some value in this section. But those who are looking for fuel to feed their own negative views on Islam... they might find even more of value here. <br>  <br>  As far as the consequences, I don't worry all that much about the consequences of what others say. As long as there are those who choose to set a good example, those who are seeking something good in this place will find it.
ddWK5JRKaa	My friend, Cameron, the unknown is a source of great fear for a lot of us. Anything medical carries a risk of something going wrong, no matter how routine it is.  Procedures are routine for the doctors who perform them, but for those of us who are going through them they are new and scary.  Nothing wrong with bringing some healthy fear with you into it, Cam. I hope you know that when a doctor says it's routine that means it's being done every day and they do them enough that they are confident in their ability to do them successfully more often than not (hence the risk).  I suggest you think of your friends and the people who love you being there with you and holding your hand as you go into this. For me, when I do that I don't feel as scared. <br>  Usually with tests like these, the doctor wants to either rule out or confirm suspicions about what is happening to you.  In this case, I hope they find whatever you have and do all they can to take it away and let you be healthy again.  You deserve to be over this and I hope these procedures will lead to that for you!  That's one way to get throught it if you think of the best result!  I wish you the best, Cameron and I hope to hear you are over it all very soon!|`|l8c2kTlvaa	involve yourslef in something else to take your mind off of it - going out with friends can be good if you remember not to make a big deal about it, but let them know your a bit nervous and they will support you.<br>  If you can't, then read a book or watch your favourite movie, just keep youself occupied and busy doing stuff so you don't even think about being worried :)|`|RALliiZTaa	I suggest that you do some research on the procedures before you follow through with it. I know it will be very scary for you but if you have better knowledge of it, it won't be as bad as you think. fear is normal. courage means facing that fear and doing what you have to do, even though you are afraid of that fear|`|Cn9WIJhgaa	Dont be it will be alright!|`|UbvglIS6aa	Fear is normal in this situation.  Simply do what you have to do.  Courage isn't the absence of fear, it's doing what you have to do in spite of it.  I suggest you read up on the procedures.  Then put the information down and relax.  Meditate.  Do something to take your mind off it for a while.  It won't completely alleviate the fear, but it will help you manage it.|`|HAHDipTAaa	What you are going through is something that almost everyone would feel nervous about. To those that give advice, it is easy,  they don't have the worry of what you are dealing with. But the answer is in your own mind. When I am in a situation like this (and I am right now) I tell myself that I have to do this thing before I can get better and when this stage is over I will be on my way to being well again. Then it only becomes a hurdle to cross before the next step. When all the steps are completed I will be well. I find that breaking it down in to manageable bits helps me cope. Hope this helps and good luck. Peter.
ig6qg2R4aa	Ok, I know for a fact a history channel would not say Hitler wanted the world to be dominated by the Aryan race because that was the kind of guys he was attracted to. Yes, Hitler wanted the world to be dominated by blonde haired, blue eyed people, women and men. He believed that they were far superior to all others. In the olympics, Germany only contribuited people who were of the Aryan race because Hitler wanted to prove that they were physically superior to all others (and they mostly won, losing in only a few events). Hitler had many mistresses, and he married his final one, Eva Braun just a while before they killed themselves.|`|19QSiNqgaa	yes he was, it is a matter of public record that in his youth in Berlin he was arrested twice for male on male prostitution.|`|qTRzRi8gaa	No, I don't think so.  He had some officers in his political party that were gay.  He didn't approve, as gays were on his genocide list, but he seemed to tolerate it for a while if it suited him.  I'm not really that big on history so I can't remember who specifically.  I think it was the leader of his former SA before he had them killed off.  I don't think Hitler was gay, personally.  I suppose it's possible, but I find it kind of doubtful.<br>  <br>  Hitler wanted the whole blonde haired/blue eyed thing because he was a racial purist.  He believed other phenotypes were inferior to the whole Nordic ideal thing so he wanted to breed more 'superior' people to overpower the perceived lesser races and such.|`|b1233d2957b6685f6644485ce17a6f62aa	I don't think he would have sent them to concentration camps if he was gay himself.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph_175" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph_1...</a>|`|YTasscmKaa	No, but he was way kinky. One of his girlfriend's actually killed herself because she couldn't deal.|`|jcVJM8FNaa	Not sureee.|`|oPQAPfYXaa	The evidence indicates asexuality.  Hitler was, frankly, the prude's prude.  That there are examples where he and his party tolerated homosexuals is misleading.  The reality was that Hitler tolerated homosexuality, as long as the party member in question was useful, and, above all, discreet.  For non-party citizens, and minorities, homosexuality was liable to earn one a visit to a concentration camp, or, for repeat offenders, worse yet.|`|2rqNI0Dwaa	He was definitely attracted to men.  But the reason he wanted a dominant race with blonde hair and blue eyes is because those are typical features of the German race, which he viewed as superior.|`|nMDT6QBfaa	Hmmmm... I've done a lot of research on Hitler, and I never discovered his sexuality. I assume he was straight considering his girlfriend, but I suppose we will never know.|`|52VDjbNTaa	What the hell?<br>  He ordered thousands of homosexuals to be killed, I sincerely doubt he was...|`|W2YtVUqKaa	I think that was his way of getting support from the German people.|`|7U0hQ1VPaa	NO! his penis was Way too small.|`|ADP9swbMaa	I've heard that before, but I'm fairly sure it's all just rumors.|`|KBvkGc6baa	i don't think so because he sent gays to concentration camps|`|C5aixj0Gaa	I personally highly doubt it.|`|mR3bbuTsaa	dont think so..... <br>  was he never thought bout that lol

cwbMGfhiaa	In common language the soul is the mind, the will, and the emotions.<br>  In Hebrew it was "nephesh" . This word is not to be confused with spirit which is the energizing force, i.e. like a battery. The spirit is in Greek "pneuma" (invisible active force).  When God breathed into Adam, he gave him "ruuah" the breath of life and God's spirit entered him then. Another aspect of the Holy Spirit in Greek is "parakletos" (helper). Hence, you can see they are defining different  aspects. The Holy Spirit can be teacher, helper, and comforter.<br>  <br>  Often people mistakenly use these terms interchangeably. Incidently, souls can die (Jesus poured out his soul to the death (Mark 14:34) Ezekiel 18:4 said the soul that sinneth, it itself shall die.<br>  <br>  See Hebrews 12:4 for more proof.|`|xzDUznOQaa	It's basically you. you may ask why such a person as yourself is walking...living and breathing perfectly..this cant be chance...you were made for a reason and that is why you feel existance...its who you are...your organs become nothing when you decompose but you have a soul, an existance in this world....acknowledge it!|`|sg7qEqZsaa	YOUR SPIRITUAL BODY, AFTER YOU DIE, GOD WILL EITHER LET YOU INTO HEAVEN OR SEND YOU TO HELL.|`|X1OUnP0Kaa	i think its that organ that's right behind your lungs..wait that's probably a tumor|`|vOuSZnKxaa	Soul is the over-all belief system you have created about yourself.  It includes the Ego and subconscious, and dies when you die.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	You could have to sift through a ton of lies, mistaken beliefs, etc., or you could turn to Genesis 2:7.<br>  <br>  And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.  <br>  <br>  The Jehovah's Witnesses notwithstanding, the Lord placed Adam's spirit within him, gave him the energy needed to sustain life, and switched on all the infinitely complex biological processes that we call life.<br>  <br>  Every living thing has a body and a spirit, making it a living soul.|`|1CS2KR7Taa	Our soul is a window.<br>  Looking through this window we can see the whole of reality, from which most of it is hidden to our physical senses.<br>  There is a vast world around us, in which our physical world, detected by our 5 physical senses is just a very small particle.<br>  While we live in this small physical world we have the chance to develop our soul which is not in us automatically, and with the help of this soul we can start to sense the "whole picture".<br>  As the laws of the "real reality" are based upon harmony, and the total unity of its parts, we can only develop and start using our soul if we adjust ourselves to those laws.<br>  We cannot have a soul individually, we can only acquire it by connecting to others, building relationships based on giving, and mutual guarantees. When we have such connections, the soul will be revealed in between us, within those connections.<br>  We can open up this window while still living in the same world, in our same physical bodies.<br>  I hope it answers your question, all the best.|`|303F69Woaa	We are souls, animals are souls. A soul is a living creature in which there is the breath of life. And the soul dies. Ezekiel 18:4 People will thumbs me down out of ignorance because the truth actually frightens them.

So een onderduiker is someone who "dives under".<br>  Geen dank en succes met het leren van Nederlands!|`|AnhoHRFTaa	onderuikers means hiding. So in the context of WW2 it may relate to the hiding of Jews from the Germans who wanted to gather all Jews in Europe and send them to gas chambers where they were gassed to death. Some Dutch did help Jews to hide from the Germans. The Dutch along with most Scandinavian countries, did the most to help their local Jewish communities to escape.<br>  <br>  Usually today, when talking of these things, the word German is replaced by the word Nazis. This gives the impression in modern Europe that the mass murderers were not Germans but this strange race called Nazis. But they were Germans so I never say Nazis, I always remind people that they were Germans|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	In a political sense, it means someone going into hiding, which I think is the word you are looking for.<br>  It also means someone ducking their head under water.|`|6m3h2yr5aa	people who are in hiding.

VWtUhan3aa	Baron, <br>  <br>  The answer to all of the above is an unequivocal yes. I suppose that should be the totality of my answer, but being a tad long winded I feel compelled to elaborate. lol <br>  <br>  Would I donate X amount of cash to help someone transition? Yes. Within my means I would do so, and perhaps even beyond my means. If I see someone starving, or who claims to be or appears to be starving, out of fuel or in any way in some dire need I'll give up my $20. Even if it meant that I myself wouldn't eat that day. Because I'm still stuffed with the Cheetos and popcorn and tacos or whatever I had the day before. I'm not hurting, or at least not in that way. Even if I have good reason to believe or were otherwise convinced that I'm being fed a lie... that the money is going to alcohol or drugs... well, who am I to judge or lecture them on what they need? Some people "need" that drink or fix to live. I won't cast that stone.<br>  <br>  Would I volunteer to talk with someone who is having a hard time? Yes. I do it every day on here and quite often in real space. I tend to be a listener (which I guess is kinda hard to believe by now lol) and am somewhat empathic. To the point that I almost consider it a curse. But a blessing as well. It's quite something to see through the masks and facades of the people around me and see, like looking through plastic wrap, the real thing. Everyone has issues and everyone, I don't care how misanthropic, needs not just an ear, but someone who merits them worthwhile to lend that ear!<br>  <br>  And the above goes hand in hand with being willing to be a friend of the one in need. Yes, of course. I am not made of money, but I do give what I can to St. Jude's in Memphis, the American Diabetes Association (my brother is type 2) and the Fraternal Order of Police (although I think it's actually called something else.. o_O). I have a friend with 2 kids who'se husband was killed while stopping someone for speeding. And of course I give to the American Cancer Society, seeing as how I've had it for the past 8 years. Ungh!!!<br>  <br>  And what does this all have to do with donating $20 to help someone transition? lol Two things, really. First, that though I am human and have my share of troubles & worries & such, and though I've basically been ill my entire life... I've never been truly alone. I've never been without someone to love me and accept me. Even though with my folks it's sort of "We won't ask & you don't tell", I know they know & I know they know I know they know. lol So I'm not "really" alone and misunderstood. And I've never been lacking in material things.<br>  <br>  Second, because (and as corny as it may sound) I believe it is each person's duty and responsibility to look out for their fellow man and woman, period. If we don't do this, then we are all screwed. And so it doesn't matter if it's a donation to St. Jude's or a person on the street or a donation for a transition: Everybody has needs which need to be fulfilled in order to keep them alive, and to me the difference between that need being a drink or a blood transfusion a physical alteration or listening ear are one and the same.<br>  <br>  I'm no hero. I'm not anything. Lol I'm just a simple gay boy... well, I am 25, so a gay man. But a simple one at that. Texarkana! Weee! How can I help?<br>  <br>  Omega|`|dvz6wPVNaa	wow, hard to put into words... i think everyone deserves the right to be happy.  i would certainly donate if there was such a group.  i have never turned away a friend based on any or no orientation.  we are people first, our bodies don't define who we are inside.  it is a sad state of affairs when we forget that...|`|52VDjbNTaa	I would, definitely.<br>  But ￡20, because I'm British, haha. =P<br>  I think it's a worthwhile cause.<br>  People should always be helped when they can be, and it's no skin off my nose.|`|ox6ESqzjaa	Without question I would.|`|iSvDvFneaa	I definitely would.<br>  <br>  Let's start.<br>   : )|`|UyDkYaXuaa	Sure, I'm always helping people out!|`|IJMyRWp4aa	yes i would do all of that|`|QlMubgPcaa	Yes, if in a position I would. For many time would certainly be easier then money as many of us are living pay check to pay check if were lucky enough to have a check. Personally I spend enough time online I might as well be doing something constructive or helpfull.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	Wow. You know, I've been thinking about transsexual/transgender issues, an I really wish there was a cause to donate to, I would be all over that. Like an organization that is out for the interests of trans people, lobbys for them, funds surgeries, support groups, an educational speakers. I'd give so much money to that, maybe if I become a millionaire :-P|`|xuuaMTmtaa	Donate $20.00 to help another person transition?<br>  <br>    Yes, if I'm able.  I've helped FTM friends purchase their testosterone, and I've given them their shots for them (which I'm trained to do)  rather than them schedule a doctor's appointment to have a nurse do it (which costs money).  So I think over time, I've helped save people more than $20.00 in their transition.  I've also donated educational materials, books, time, a listening ear.  I think some of that is a lot more valuable than just handing someone a $20.00.<br>  <br>  Contrary to what a lot of people probably think of me, I am a compassionate person.  However, I do still have my own needs to think about too, and my own sanity comes first.  When I'm in a place to help others I can and do.  When I'm not, I don't .<br>  <br>  *EDIT* There IS a cause you can donate to.  A lot of trans people put up "taking donations" things on their personal blogs and stuff, but if you go www.thetransitionalmale.com, you can help FTM's transition and cover things like cost of hormones, help with living expenses (many of them get thrown out of their homes or become homeless, or lose jobs) , or if YOU are FTM, you can donate your old binders (like after you get chest surgery) to help another pre-op FTM.  These things DO exist and they are out there already.|`|le9ZROs5aa	I would donate time and money. As you know some people have a much more difficult time with transition than me and have a lot harder time coping than me. So I would love to help anyone I could. Sure I would be a friend. Why wouldn't I?|`|7aK81hsbaa	i've always dreamed of doing exactly this. i also manage a non-profit, please notify me if i can help at all.|`|7sO3tfSIaa	I wouldn't donate the money, but I would donate the time, by all means.  Before you judge, there is a reasoning behind this.  I wish I could donate to so many causes, but I can't, if I had more money I certainly would, but I have 2 children.  So I have 2 charities that I donate as much as I can to, 2 that are closest to my heart, Autism Speaks (because my son is autistic), Cystic Fibrosis (CFF I believe, because I carry the CF gene and had to face the terror of my children's  mortality being threatened before they were even born.)  <br>  <br>  And I certainly hope that anyone who turned to me would say that I do anything and everything I can to be a friend to them when they needed it.|`|KszocgnSaa	Yea I would. What about FtM? Just curious, is it the same...Where do you donate money?<br>  Oh yea. I've done that once before. <br>  Yea. Sometimes a friend is all someone needs. Like that one story about how this guy was gonna kill himself but then he made a friend and the next day he was going to but the friend would again help him carry his books and that happened until he didn't wanna die.<br>  <br>  What else would I do? Whatever else is needed and asked of me. I go by the whole all you gotta do is ask thing. Please don't say anything about me being a push over either (I get that a lot). I just think that if I was in there shoes I would want help too. Treat others how you wanna be treated. :)<br>  <br>  Hope you have an amazing day!

The house must be a tabernacle or tent, such as soldiers now use in the camp, which was both a mean dwelling and a movable one; and yet the ark of God had not better, till Solomon built the temple 480 years after this, 1Ki_6:1. God manifested his presence among them thus in a tabernacle, <br>  1. In compliance with their present condition in the wilderness, that they might have him with them wherever they went. Note, God suits the tokens of his favour, and the gifts of his grace, to his people's wants and necessities, according as they are, accommodating his mercy to their state, prosperous or adverse, settled or unsettled. When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, Isa_43:2. <br>  2. That it might represent the state of God's church in this world, it is a tabernacle-state, Psa_15:1. We have here no continuing city; being strangers in this world, and travellers towards a better, we shall never be fixed till we come to heaven. Church-privileges are movable goods, from one place to another; the gospel is not tied to any place; the candlestick is in a tent, and may easily be taken away, Rev_2:5. If we make much of the tabernacle, and improve the privilege of it, wherever we go it will accompany us; but, if we neglect and disgrace it, wherever we stay it will forsake us. What hath my beloved to do in my house? Jer_11:15.<br>  II. The curtains of the tabernacle must correspond to a divine pattern. <br>  1. They were to be very rich, the best of the kind, fine twined linen; and colours very pleasing, blue, and purple, and scarlet. <br>  2. They were to be embroidered with cherubim (Exo_26:1), to intimate that the angels of God pitch their tents round about the church, Psa_34:7. As there were cherubim over the mercy-seat, so there were round the tabernacle; for we find the angels compassing, not only the throne, but the elders; see Rev_5:11. 3. There were to be two hangings, five breadths in each, sewed together, and the two hangings coupled together with golden clasps, or tacks, so that it might be all one tabernacle, Exo_26:6. Thus the churches of Christ and the saints, though they are many, are yet one, being fitly joined together in holy love, and by the unity of the Spirit, so growing into one holy temple in the Lord, Eph_2:21, Eph_2:22; Eph_4:16. This tabernacle was very strait and narrow; but, at the preaching of the gospel, the church is bidden to enlarge the place of her tent, and to stretch forth her curtains, Isa_54:2.<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|AA11232725	It was symbolic for the present time <br>  <br>  Hebrews 8:3  Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer.  4  If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are already men who offer the gifts prescribed by the law.  5  They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: "See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain."<br>  <br>  Hebrews 9:1  Then indeed, even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service and the earthly sanctuary.  2  For a tabernacle was prepared: the first part, in which was the lampstand, the table, and the showbread, which is called the sanctuary;  3  and behind the second veil, the part of the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of All,  4  which had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which were the golden pot that had the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;  5  and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.  <br>  <br>  6  Now when these things had been thus prepared, the priests always went into the first part of the tabernacle, performing the services.  7  But into the second part the high priest went alone once a year, not without blood, which he offered for himself and for the people's sins committed in ignorance;  8  the Holy Spirit indicating this, that the way into the Holiest of All was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was still standing.  <br>  <br>  9  It was symbolic for the present time in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make him who performed the service perfect in regard to the conscience  10  concerned only with foods and drinks, various washings, and fleshly ordinances imposed until the time of reformation. <br>  <br>   11  But Christ came as High Priest of the good things to come, with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation.  12  Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.  <br>  <br>  13  For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies for the purifying of the flesh,  14  how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?  15  And for this reason He is the Mediator of the new covenant, by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, that those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Exodus 26 describes God's specs for the Tabernacle<br>  <br>  Try this:<br>  <br>  Exd 26:1   "Make the Tabernacle from ten sheets of fine linen.

Speak with your priest or pastor.  Plan your journey and ask God to grant you peace with your mission and let you know what to do next.  If you surrender to God's will, He will provide and guide you on your path.  It need not be what some monks and nuns do, maybe you could start a youth group in your area to bring young people into the faith.  You could start by visiting a nursing home or veterans hospital and volunteering your time and compassion.  Jesus did say, "what you do to others, you do to me".  This means that spreading love and compassion is the work of God and Christ, no matter how small you start.  Just remember to keep going, keep building on your faith and never falter in sharing God's Word.  May God bless and keep you in your mission.|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	Before you do any more reading of your Bible, pray first for the Holy Spirit to give you discernment and understanding of what you are reading.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	You don't HAVE to sell up, it means to be detached from worldly goods|`|dmHr3orqaa	It is a bit extreme, but most people don't see it that way.

Some things we need to give up because we give them to much esteem in our lives. <br>  For example, I gave up playing the guitar since I was having issues with pride.

I think he was just trying to tell you to give to more people and help spread his word. but pray to him and ask him to lead you to do the right thing. and dont worry, dont be afraid of pain, for if god does call you to die for him, you'll be in a glorious place a few seconds after death, and thats what really matters. good luck and god bless!|`|pj2bnJgjaa	Being a Christian is submitting to the Lordship of Christ.

You just need to live your life in a holy, Christian way -- that doesn't necessarily mean traveling from country to country. It just means doing little things, like stepping in when someone denies Jesus or your faith and explaining why they are wrong. Jesus also says, "For whoever denies me, I will deny in front of my Father." <br>            Just live your life so that you are happy, and if you are living in holiness at the same time, God will be happy, as well. <br>  Hope this helped.<3|`|AA11115051	If GOD has told you to sell it all do it.

If your faith is strong and you believe in him who shall you fear? no one. If GOD is with us who can be against us? no one. I suggest going to places where the Gospel hasn't been preached.

Mark 12: 30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.<br>  <br>  31 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.<br>  <br>  Name, until you can truly say you live these two commandment, do not do something so foolish as to selling all you have, giving to the poor.  One other thing, the scripture is clear, women are not called to preach.  Now, don't let that shut me off from you, it is just God saying it not me.<br>  When the rich young ruler approached Jesus about what he had to do to be saved--after questioning back and forth Jesus told him to sell all he had and give to the poor, come follow me.  Why?  Because those earthly wealth was keeping him from salvation.  He walked away rich but lost to God.  That is not your situation, you seem to have a deep love for God, a desire to serve.<br>  The other time this same concept came up, the early church truly believed that the end time was at hand, so they sold all their goods, gave to the poor and lived like a commune.  Jesus had told them no man know the time or place, they thought they were so Christian they did know, but 2000 years later we know they are wrong.  The day of the preacher going from town to town and finding friends to feed and clothe them is way, long time over.  whether it was a good thing or not, it is over, you would most likely be forced into a street life.<br>  Here is what God wants from you, and from me, and all those he saves.  He wants us first and foremost to live Mark 12:30-31, literally.<br>  Each day, each hour, each minute and each second of the rest of our lives, we are to live in this sinful world as if we are no longer part of it.  We are to mirror image Jesus, so when people see us, they see Jesus.  We are here to "TELL" Jesus, we are not responsible for saving the world, just tell the world, we do not save, Jesus saves, we do not condemn the World, their sins condemn them, we do not Woo the lost, the Holy Spirit woos them.  We tell, that is our job, our command.<br>  I am almost complete in writing a novel on World Mission.  I chose India as my subject nation to which I lead a group of twelve.  We teach people there not about Jesus, we do mirror him in  how we treat the people and each other.  We do teach them cottage industry so they earn money to buy food.  We show them technology which lightens the load of labor.  As their life gets better, we find they want what we have, for we treat them as equal even in spite of their terrible caste system.  We show them respect, we never force them to be Christians, we do not condemn them for being Hindu.  WE treat them as we think Jesus would treat them.   I said all that to say this, I am 73 years old, and I would love to go and live the rest of my life, living my novel, even if I got killed trying.  I will be going, God willing, this summer, it may be for two weeks as planned or for two years if God plans it.  I am, you are, just a willing vessel, flow to God's will (desire) shut these other advisers you have out and let the Holy Spirit inform you of God's will for your life.  If you decide to live Mar. 12:30-31, that will be a narrow path, a difficult path to follow, but it is not a path to salvation as you implied in your second to last sentence.  You cannot still be looking for salvation if you feel all those other things.  Now is a matter of live as a born again, the way God would have you to live.  If you can do the Mark thing, you will have the faith maturity to know God's will for your life, for you will be living it.|`|LYPWNxx5aa	First, you should pray on it and ask God if this is what He wants you to do.

Fire, cross, struggles with wild beasts, wrenching of bones, mangling of limbs - let them come to me, provided only I make my way to Jesus Christ.

Jesus was talking to a rich person who had an unhealthy and sinful lust for money. As long as you aren't sinful in how you cling to your money and possessions I don't think you need to sell them all away. God can use your money, time, and possessions to help the poor, but God also provides for you. Don't just think that because you shouldn't cling to earthy possessions, you shouldn't use earthly possessions and money because this can be a way in which God is providing for you.|`|uUTmx9ZPaa	Praise the Lord my sister!<br>  <br>  I am just like you. Only I have gone passed the stage of confusion since I had it much earlier. I really enjoy your testimony and everything you are feeling is true. You are a chosen one of the Lord in this age. All the Christians of Old were like this. As satan worked his way in this world, he has deadened our senses of who God really is and what God really wants and how much God really cares for you. That is why you get luke warm responses from Christians. Let me tell you truthfully, God is not lukewarm. He desires a great purpose in this age and he needs people who trust him to the uttermost and will take action for their God. He will take care of everything (Dan 11:32).<br>  <br>  Matt 6:33 - Seek first God ... everything will be added unto you<br>  Is 28:16 - ...all who believe unto Him will not be put to shame<br>  Jer 32:27 - Is there anything too wonderful for me [God]?<br>  <br>  Don't worry my sister. You are on the right path. If you need more personal fellowship from someone who has gone true your stage and has given everything for the Lord, contact me personally on my profile. I have given all for the Lord, and He always covers me. He always gives me back in abundance as I pursue Him and act upon the urges He gives me in my spirit to work for him. You are a foretaste of a genuine Christian, not merely a sunday christian who lives in a big house and pursues individual dreams. Now all you need is to find the genuine expression of the Body of Christ. Amen!

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

If you try to equate 2012 with Y2K or some other date that cried wolf, then you will be making the worst mistake of your lifetime. Research all these things FOR YOURSELF!|`|2PZnXjZ7aa	Let me start from the beginning...<br>  The Mayans were an ancient civilization, and very advanced. They knew the world was round, the true length of the year, etc. Their specialty was astronomy. They were able to plot a calender up to thousands of years. Heck, they could even have kept going if they wanted to. Yet, they ended it on December 21th, 2012...<br>  Like most civilizations, the Mayans had their own religion and their own Gods. They believed that three worlds were created before ours. Each was destroyed because it's humans were defective. We've only lasted so long because are the true people, made out of maize, a sacred corn to the Mayan. They say the end of this world is (you guessed it) December 21th, 2012!<br>  Along with this, there's several other things happening in 2012. First off, the planets are going to put on a little show for us! A few planets are going to line up. Alas, this occurs at noon, so I don't know if we'll see it. There's also a possible reversal of Earth's magnetic field. Research for some more if you'd like.<br>  Now I'll inform you 'bout some past parallel prophecies. A notable one is Nostradamus, the most famous end-time prophet. He saw visions or premonitions, and tried his best to put them into words. True, they're not specifically linked to 2012. Apparently, a comet will come, coinciding with earthquakes and other natural disasters. Also mentioned is a conjunction of the planets. Some interpret the words to describe a polar shift. *hint hint, nudge nudge* Anyways, the Earth changes bring famine, drought, and social upheaval. Civilization will be changed. Continents will split apart with waterways. Powerful nations will be weakened. The soical upheave will allow an antichrist to come to power.<br>  The Book of Revelation in the Bible is one of the best-known texts on end times. It talks about seven seals/scrolls opening, each with an event happening. Then, four angels appear and release winds of destruction. They're told to hold back the winds until Christ puts a seal on the foreheads of 144,000 worthy servants of God who will not be touched by the destruction. This also tells of an antichrist who will achieve world domination. The antichrist will rule until the battle of the Armaggeddon. At this point, Jesus returns to Earth, the 144,000 are sent to heaven, and Christ destorys the armies of the antichrist, who is thrown into a lake of fire. As this happens to Earth, a war is in heaven as well. Angels fight Satan, who is also thrown into the lake of fire.<br>  Edgar Cayce has been told as one of the greatest prophets of all time. He said that the end time would come within the next generation of his period, meaning around 1958 and 1998. Of course, it didn't happen. His basic prophecy fits, but the only relation to time ending in 2012 is the possible polar shift. Here's some hightlights of his end-time prophecy: The Atlantis and Pacific coats of America will be altered. New York city, San Fransico, and Los Angeles will disappear. Russia will become the spiritual hope of the world. Intense Earthquakes will destory California and the Baja peninsula will diappear. The Pacific ocrean will near Arizona and Nebraska. Mount Etna will erupt, signaling the sign of real changes. The Great Lakes will drain into the Gulf thorugh the Mississippi. Japan will go under sea. There will be a pole shift and ice caps will melt, meaning flooding. And new lands will rise out of the ocean, along with lost lands such as Atlantis.<br>  Now let's go to the Skeptic's Corner! There are several problems with 2012 predictions. Many do not come with dates and are vague. If a prediction does come with a date, it turns out to be wrong. What's the purpose of a prediction? Like Nostadamus. Many of his predictions are realized to be true until after it's happened. Useful, huh? The theory of the pole shift is an application of bad science. Have you heard of self-fullining prophecies? A child spills milk on himself, and thinks of himself as accident-prone. Then, several more accidents happen since he damaged his self-confidence. The prophecy is fulfilled. Remember this with 2012.<br>  In case you do indeed believe that the world could end in 2012 and you're scared, here's a bit of advice. It's no accident that you were born in this specific time of history. You were born ot be here. Perhaps you're meant to see the world as it ends. How do you know if this is true? Well, asking about 2012 is the first sign! <br>  I hope I've explained this all well enough.

Their opinion is backed up by science.

Like Christmas has anything to do with Jesus. Or Easter, for that matter. Both were pagan ritual days adapted by early Christians to convert nonbelievers, and assigned specific "events" in the life of their fictional savior. That goes for Halloween, too.

Agnosticism means one believes it is impossible to prove whether or not there is a god.  Christmas was originally a pagan celebration, and you can get Solstice greeting cards from atheist websites.  Halloween is also a pagan holiday.<br>  <br>  Many of us go for the cultural aspects of these holidays and ignore any religious trappings.  And just because a group is Christian doesn't mean we can't enjoy their music.  I happen to like Evanescence's album "Fallen"; so what?  <br>  <br>  And when we do stand up for our beliefs--seriously stand up--you believers get very, very upset.|`|uCRIQg0iaa	lol i like this question. The problem is that atheists are too lazy to believe in something because of the responsibility it gives them.

Get away from me*, you workers of lawlessness. --Matthew 7:21-23  <br>  <br>  "...The inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of time some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired utterances and teachings of demons, by the *hypocrisy of men who speak lies*, marked in their conscience as with a branding iron; *forbidding to marry*, *commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be partaken of* with thanksgiving by those who have faith and accurately know the truth." --1 Timothy 4:1-3<br>  <br>  "You hypocrites, Isaiah aptly prophesied about You:<br>   ‘This people honors me with their lips, yet their heart is far removed from me.  It is in vain that they keep worshiping me, because *they teach commands of men as doctrines*.’”  --Matthew 15:7,8   <br>  <br>  " For *such men are false apostles, deceitful workers*, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.  And no wonder, for Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light.  It is therefore nothing great if his ministers also keep transforming themselves into ministers of righteousness. But their end shall be according to their works. --2 Corinthians 11:13-15  <br>  <br>  “Test the inspired expressions to see whether they originate with God, <br>  because many false prophets have gone forth into the world." --1 John 4:1  <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/20010801/article_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/20010801/article...</a><br>  <br>  Also of note: Cassianus, a monk of Marseilles, writing in the fifth century C.E., contrasted the first-century Christians with the church of his day, saying: “It ought to be known that the observance of the forty days [of Lent] had no existence, so long as the perfection of that primitive church remained inviolate.”<br>  ---The Two Babylons, by Alexander Hislop, p.104 (London; 1957).|`|QyAyQf3Laa	All traditions that really have nothing to do with serving God truthfully and with whole heart and mind; just god-like appearances of something with really no power or meaning to God behind these meaningless traditions.<br>  <br>  What do they have to do with "The fruitages of the spirit" and showing love for your fellow human? The traditions you mention are all showy and yet are very empty traditions holding no real substance in how to serve God per his will.<br>  <br>  Worldy traditions is a way for Satan to jump in and mislead the masses away from what they should really be doing, and that's practicing the fruitages of the spirit everyday in our lives:<br>  <br>  GALATIANS 5: 14 - 26:<br>  <br>  For the entire Law stands fulfilled in one saying, namely: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” If, though, YOU keep on biting and devouring one another, look out that YOU do not get annihilated by one another. But I say, Keep walking by spirit and YOU will carry out no fleshly desire at all. For the flesh is against the spirit in its desire, and the spirit against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, so that the very things that YOU would like to do YOU do not do. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, if YOU are being led by spirit, YOU are not under law. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, and they are fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct, idolatry, practice of spiritism, enmities, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, contentions, divisions, sects, envies, drunken bouts, revelries, and things like these. As to these things I am forewarning YOU, the same way as I did forewarn YOU, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s kingdom. On the other hand, the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control. Against such things there is no law. Moreover, those who belong to Christ Jesus impaled the flesh together with its passions and desires. If we are living by spirit, let us go on walking orderly also by spirit.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

But I personally don't believe it will be like who wants to be a millionaire (in that there are questions), but more like what were the intentions of your heart whether that is heard in the sense of questions or what I do not know, but the most important thing is God will delve into the heart to see whether intentions hav been good or evil.|`|SGiVFN9taa	If you were put under hypnosis,<br>  everything from the moment you were born<br>  to the minutest detail that you have no recollection on<br>  would come forth, as if it just happened.<br>  (All that memory comes from a fatty blob<br>  that science refers to as brain matter).<br>  <br>  <br>  The Old Testament speaks of a Book of Records<br>  where everything in one's life is automatically recorded<br>  (which will be opened in our presence on Judgment Day).<br>  <br>  <br>  And no...

QjZN3A3raa	Pride keeps you from quitting when there is no other reason to continue. Pride prevents you from doing things that could bring shame and embarrassment to you yourself and your loved ones. Pride is a huge motivator when it works properly. Most people who act like they have too much pride are usually using it to cover up major insecurities.|`|aJB1OPoFaa	Money.and that's it|`|Pvp36CRyaa	self esteem and gaining awareness.
0bYcYz2jaa	No.  Schindler's List is about a man trying to save people during a terrible period in time.  I would say "The Ten Commandments" is a better comparison.  They are movies portraying major happenings in our religious histories.  I do not feel I know enough about Islam and Hinduism to hazard a guess as to their pertinent religious films.  And since Atheists hold nothing sacred, there cannot be a real comparison.|`|NCRfZRopaa	No, as the Holocaust actually happened. Schindler (if he did exist) actually saved people. "Schindler's List" is a much better film.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	I don't think any movie speaks for Christianity (or any other religion). For every Christian that loved "The Passion of the Christ," I can name two that hated it. It was pretty much just torture porn. Frankly, if your entire religion can be properly summed up or "spoken for" in a movie, it doesn't really say much for your religion (or lack thereof).|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	The movie Gandhi.<br>  <br>  If you want a free resource, do a search on "Gospel Enigma" for an e-book that restores the spiritual side of Christianity... which is in harmony with Hinduism and Islam and all other spiritual traditions.|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	No, "Passion" tells the central story of Christianity.  "Schinder's List" is a moving story, but it has nothing to do with the practice of the Judaic faith.|`|llDXCv4raa	I think they should make a period peace that took place when pagan Europeans were forced to become Christian. That would be a good one for all those that include any European paganism in their beliefs.|`|G38ltd04aa	No it's not the same...<br>  <br>  Schindler's List is based on historical facts.<br>  <br>  Passion is based on biblical story telling, which is not an accurate account of history.|`|4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	You mean, is it a 120 minute guilt-trip?  Yes, I'd say that Passion of the Christ is.  Schindler's List however at least has historical accuracy and a bit of a plot to it.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	I don't see the connection between the two movies, except that I have both of them in my collection.|`|bKwCs8zhaa	No, The Ten Commandments is.<br>  My fav movie is The Big Lebowski.|`|pOP0Jt0Qaa	Let's see... Schindler saved Jews from the Nazis, who in turn killed millions of Jews in Jesus's name.<br>  <br>  I don't think so.
sozYIzzHaa	i guess that's why they call it faith...it's belief without proof. but i agree with your point. for example, "younger" generations of muslims are taught to hate jews, but "older" history proves islam has always been in good terms with jews. as a matter of fact, mohammad himself referred to the jews as the "chosen" people, but that teaching has been changed by the extremists for their own purposes...|`|Z3W8t5QJaa	Nope, not for me. My faith is that I believe in God, the afterlife, spirits, all that. I dont subscribe to the faith that others made up thousands of years ago, as you've said. I have my own beliefs and values which arent in accordance with any religion.|`|SRFfK0BPaa	well, my belief in God does not only come from the bible.. or words, or something my parents told me..<br>  <br>  to me it is common sense, when you have a relationship with Christ, you can see the light, you know the truth.. you see the world as Gods creation|`|ExQGD2uwaa	I've "never seen or heard God before"???

And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him,<br>  "Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst<br>  is withered away."<br>  22. And Jesus answering saith unto them,<br>  "Have Faith in God.<br>  23. "For verily I say unto you,<br>  'That whosoever shall say unto this mountain,<br>  "Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the Sea;"<br>  and shall not doubt in his heart,<br>  but shall believe that those things <br>  which HE saith SHALL come to pass; <br>  he SHALL have WHATSOEVER he saith.<br>  24.

Faith is for small kids who are NOT going anywhere NEAR "Heaven."|`|UCrcbyCPaa	In the name of Allah the most Gracious the Most Merciful.<br>  <br>  Thank you for giving me a chance to say something about my religion.<br>  Every child is born pure on a natural disposition in the belief of one God.As He / She is growing up it is the parents who decide the relgion as practiced by them.If the child is born in a hindu family he becomes a hindu,if a child is born in a christan family he becomes a christain and so on ,His / her  faith is then channelled accordingly.<br>  As a christain earlier there was this belief in God,But the worship is directed to jesus [peace be upon him]and God is condidered as three gods in one God,Jesus is condidered as son of God and God himself,which no christain can make up his or her mind about.Then you believe just like that ,Jesus died for your sins and behold you are saved.never mimd what jesus said.never mind the flaws in the bible,never mind you cannot explain the three in one concept,Just have faith in what the church is telling you !<br>  But when i reverted to islam i found that Faith is not needed to be based on Blind concepts.God Almighty Proves his existance,and then tells us to have faith in Him,worship him,and follow his commands.In retiurn he the almighty promises us a home in Paradise or punishment in the fire of hell if we disobey him.He also gave us a religion to follow which he called Islam--[which means to attain peace by submitting yourself to the will of almighty God alone]and he called such people Muslims.<br>  Our faith in Islam is based on rock solid foundation of proof,logic and reason.It is a continous chain without any flaws,without any contradictions,Islam does not shy away from reality and does not make compromises in acts of worship.There is no blind faith in islam.<br>  The Holy Quran is the word of God and the Pinnacle of our faith.It was revealed in a span of 23 years to the prophet Muhammad [peace and blessings upon him].Because the prophet was uneducated ,people believed him as he began to recite the words of God in form of sheer poetry which even the most learned of the arabian world could not produce.These words were written down by the trustful companions of the prophet[peace be upon him]on whatever material was available at that time and it is preserved to this date.The Prophet[peace and blessings on him] would check and cross check the written words from time to time.We see that since the Quran was revealed 1500 years ago not a single letter has been changed removed or added. and there is only one version of the Holy Quran.<br>  when you read the holy Quran your faith increases with leaps and boiunds because you know you are reading the truth as God reveals his signs with proof of he being the creator, the posessor of this universe.There are hundreds of scientific facts in the Quran that gladdens the heart as to date no one person has been able tp prove the Quran wrong.For Eg.The Quran tells you of the perfect stages of Human developent in the mothers womb with its apperance.So we ask ourselves how would prophet Muhammad[peace be upon him]know this so perfectly 1500 years ago without any scientific instrument present at that time and which has only been found out by modern science recently//The Answer is Plain and simple definitly this information was given to the Prophet by the one who has created us Almighty God himself.This elevates your faith and makes you sure that there is a God and these are the words of God Almighty.The Holy Quran does not contain the words of Prophet Muhammad,or his biography or his family tree etc,Its is purely Gods word and nothing else.<br>  Then we have the life style of the Prophet as an example and his sayings which have been preserved to this day through a chain of narrators that can be proved!!!No false claims in Islam. Great historians,intellects,and world renowned personalities[non muslims]including mahatma Ghandhi who studied the lifestyle of the Prophet pf islam Closely Praised him and have elected his as the grestest Human who ever walked this earth!!!<br>  Muslims do not lap up anything our imams say.Any statement made about religion has to be proved from the Quran or the teachings of the Prophet[peace be on him]or it is REJECTED.So much so that when the Imams are conducting our prayers and reciting the Quran,if he makes one mistake we correct him on the spot and he accepts the correction.The Quran can never be tampered with or changed by any one as millions of people have memorised the Quran letter for letter and hence even the iman is not allowed to make a single mistake during its recitation.<br>  I can go on and on but this is what i say again and again,God does not want Blind faith but firm belief in him as the one and only one God of this universe.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

kKp8KXUraa	My suggestion would be:<br>  <br>  (…) Answering, she couldn’t help looking at him. He was really a boy, tall and handsome, he was even too attractive compared to her. But she wasn't admitting the chance of a relationship, even if it was only a comparative relationship between them. Her thoughts were only for him, and, for example, she would prefer him not to have so tidy a hair style, with brilliantine, like in the newspaper advertisements, because more girls like him that way. He would have been more handsome with his hair cut short, without brilliantine. Then she tried to imagine who he was and what he did in his life. Although nothing could suggest this, she imagined that he was an engineer. But she was led to believe it was because of a memory, among her secret memories, which regarded a young engineer, who once lived next to her and who always quarrelled with his wife. She, who at that time was eleven and still went to the primary school, fell head over heels for him, her first big love, or better the biggest, of which nobody had known anything of. “Sorry, I wasn’t paying attention,” she said realising that the boy was staring at her with a questioning look, like if he was waiting for an answer.

Webv1So2aa	You might want to elaborate. Maybe tell us about your personality. I understand that sometimes your just minding you're own business with no malice intended towards anyone and all of a sudden you feel that you are hated and there is nothing you can think about that would be a good reason to hate you. Well, you should look at the mentality of your peers. They also don't want to be ridiculed and join in the bashing. Just try to be geniune and nice but be assertive in what you believe. Maybe you just have low self esteem. Find something that you can do to help you feel better about yourself and maybe others will think better of you also.|`|UAq9ogIQaa	just be a good person,work hard at work then go home and hang with the people who love you,like your friends and family.<br>  surround yourself with people that dont hate you(away from work)<br>  and when your at work dont think,or care about how others feel about you,<br>  is your self esteem so low that you need to feed off their love and attention for you at work?<br>  know this.....if you see everyone as hating you,then thats all you will see,wherever you go,you will develope a insecurity issue about how people feel about you,,,sounds like you need to love yourself,and respect yourself more,because when you do,you wont care about how some people feel about you,you will know that your a good person inside and wont need other people to make you feel good.<br>  thats what family and your true friends are for....love yourself,and you wont care about who hates you for whatever petty reason...|`|OUo9J4i1aa	Well I don't hate you I have no reason to and I think people who hate is really a sign of immaturity.

However, so as not to appear too smug, you give me a criteria upon which you consider one as being righteous, and i'll let you know..But from the standpoint of Islam; I make five salats every day, with no exception. those prays missed at their appointed times are made up later.  i fast during Ramadan, i give in charity, and i do not fornicate. i am not married, for fear of divorce, and therefore sex outside of marriage is not an option for me. I eat Halal, because God said so; i live across the street from a Burger King, and no matter how good it may smell, it is not for me. I am of the mindset that the more i allow God to manage my life, the fewer mistakes i'll be making. i find submission to the Will of Allah to be a relief and a blessing. i bear witness to the fact that all that Allah revealed in the Quran is True. i bear witness from eyewitnessing and life experience. my faith is founded on trust, forged in trial, and adamantine and irretractable, due to life experience...i have no choice but to believe and practice deeds of righteousness; i've seen the reality with my own eyes and experience the Grace and Blessings promised...and i ain't even in Paradise yet.|`|kwCZocRyaa	No NO NO i am a very religious  person i have given up great things that i felt were ok to be righteous i want to one day be able to say god, father and savor i stand her today to tell you i here by am dead, and i will be resurrected as you're sheep and live by you're rules and worship you for ever, but now of day's you can't pull a 13 year old girl off of a dick for 2 seconds|`|fsjIeVpRaa	Well, I'll answer this question on the behalf of my own intuitions, high regards of ethics and personal etiquettecy.  This is what I believe what a righteous man should be.  And my view of righteousness is to be used towards women...so my answer here is about the courtship of a woman.<br>  <br>  The righteous men or our time is very rare, and since I am very, very eccentric; I try to make an example of those low-standard men as an embarrassment, by trying to present myself with the highest code of ethics and morals.  Whatever I witness or see from other men that I consider ruefully rude and demeaning to women...I keep note and tell myself that I would never present myself like that!  It is my mission to be unlike any other man out there, for the better.  I take it as a challenge to be the best man out there!  I try to do things that would make my mother proud, I mean, she raised me to be respectful to women, and for that I am ever greatful.  Taught me a lot about women<br>  <br>  That is because I believe high morals and ethics.  I don't like the fact that many men engage in premarital or extra-marital sex..quite frankly, it disgusts me.  I believe in courtship and chivalry.  Porn should be illegal, that is also revolting!  No men should be looking at women in magazine as if they are sex objects...it exercises their minds in doing it in public.  Such immoral thoughts leads to immoral actions.<br>  <br>  That is why many men these days are like bees, go from one flower to the next!  No public display of affection, whatsoever.  <br>  <br>  I am a practicioner in the Bushido code, that is because I am a military man.  Bushido is a warrior way of life that is about honor, commitment, and chivalry.<br>  <br>  I believe in equal partnership while in a relationship.  A man/woman should know the duties and roles of their spouse, teamwork and group effort.<br>  <br>  I am seeing a woman that I believe would make a perfect wife.  Although we are only friends, just because I am not going to push things into intimacy until marriage; I rather get to know her first, so my woman isn't really mine-yet!<br>  <br>  If only men would present themselves in a positive manner that I practice daily.  I love opening doors for (my) woman, try to comfort her in any manner (not physically).  I don't touch her in any manner.  I try to engage in conversations with her, be attentive to her ideas and beliefs.  Make her have the idea that I have interest in her topics.  I think men should learn how to communicate to women, like women do with other women.  Most guys are to stubborn or worried about emotions or their hidden feminine side.  I think men that act macho are nothing but weak-minded jerks and I don't even see how many women get attracted to rude jerks time and time again.<br>  <br>  Anyways...that is the way I try to be righteous.  I am very religious, but I cuss like a sailor and walk like a soldier.  I am a US Marine, that instills self-discipline and integrity in relationships, and our motto, Semper Fidelis, means Always Faithful. That is another thing that I live by, religously!  I would always be faithful to my woman.|`|09mW6AU2aa	Me.|`|82oTjLCAaa	i don't know...bryan adams, ?|`|kSwnlZ7Qaa	no we all have fallen short of His glory.

She was born and raised in the city of Cilician Thebe, over which her father ruled. The name means "battle of a man", from ανδρο? (andros) "of a man" and μαχη (machē) "battle".[1]<br>  <br>  'During the Trojan War, Hector was killed by Achilles, and their son Astyanax was thrown from the city walls by the Greek Herald Talthybius. Neoptolemus took Andromache as a concubine and Hector's brother, Helenus, as a slave. By Neoptolemus, she was the mother of Molossus, and according to Pausanias,[2] of Pielus and Pergamus. When Neoptolemus died, Andromache married Helenus and became Queen of Epirus. Pausanias also implies that Helenus' son, Cestrinus, was by Andromache. Andromache eventually went to live with Pergamus in Pergamum, where she died of old age.'

I've even seen one who loved Africans|`|46fouwFfaa	Not usually. Those that do or would date or even marry a black person are rare.<br>  <br>  The reason why is probably because they have a very strong cultural identity and want to retain it by marrying another person of their culture (who are also of the same ethnic group). Most Asian cultures are more similar to each other than they are to other cultures, which is probably why East Asians are usually open to dating or marrying other East Asians. Also, pressure from family and friends to not date or marry interracially might be a factor. Whites are often the only other race that many Asians are open to dating as they are seen as a hard-working and very successful race of people. However, it is mostly Asian women that date or marry white people which has something to with how Asian women are portrayed in the media as being attractive (after white women). <br>  <br>  Blacks are portrayed as being lazy, stupid, and poor or ghetto in American media. American movies and television shows are watched all over the world so of course this affects how some people view black Americans or blacks in general. Light skin is seen as an attractive feature in most Asian cultures which is also why most Asians do not find dark-skinned people attractive. Mind you, I said most or many Asians are like this. There are always exceptions.|`|fbama92eaa	Yea girl, of course some do. I can't speak for everybody, because everybody doesn't have the same preference, like I know Asian men who don't even date Asian women. There are plenty of Azn guys who like Black females.

I use to have complexes about certain things and when I finally changed my attitude and perception (how I was seeing the issues) my whole surroundings changed.  It wasn't like that anymore.  You just need to see yourself differently and believe it.  There are "nonattractive" guys that get "attractive" girls everyday. It is your attitude and beliefs about things...and you are attracting this to yourself.  Start loving women truly...no matter how many times you are rejected and eventually the tide will turn...keep doing it no matter how crappy it seems...it will eventually change...because you will begin to attract something different.<br>  <br>  Also when you see a women in need....do not just pass her up...show love...you don't got to beat anybody up or harm anybody...but if you can help....then help...the more love you give out it will start returning back to you many times over...right now you are sending out non-love and this is what you are getting back....think about it :)|`|qK91Vd2Eaa	Are you eFFin kidding me right now?

Maybe take some angry management classes or visit a psychologist. Overall, its not your fault that women these days are brought up in a society that demands them to be sluts and whore and only pick out guys that are either extremely hot or filthy rich as noted by society.|`|YxiqI903aa	I know how you feel because I feel the same way.<br>  <br>  But you don't want a girl that likes you for being a jerk, because once you stop being a jerk, she will leave you for someone who is. This is obvious, but many miss this, so it's ok.<br>  <br>  I know this may be hard but you have to understand you are different than normal. You are 6' 8" and that is way tall. And you are 258 lbs. This combination means that you are a big guy. So, normally, this is out of the range of typical person. Once you understand this, you can understand why you are treated the way you are, even if you are the handsomest and nicest guy around, girls will still treat you the same way that they are doing so now.<br>  <br>  Forget about the situation about those two in the car, because this is about you.<br>  <br>  Because you are way out of the range of typical male figures, you have to compensate for that as well. Understand that many many girls will not find you attractive, though you might be. You will just have to keep on looking.<br>  <br>  Don't be a jerk, be comforting. Girls like guys who they can feel comfortable with and who can protect them. Be that guy. Don't be macho, but be a person who can be loved. Try to put things into perspective. Otherwise, what else can you do?<br>  <br>  If you'll never get a girl, at least, be a nice and cool guy. This way people (girls) will think, "he's a nice and cool guy. I don't see why girls pass him up," as oppose to, "He's a jerk. No wonder girls pass him up."<br>  <br>  Good luck and tell me how it goes.|`|hrwnffhMaa	From what you've written i think you're 10 times more of a jerk than all those women put together. Just because you are unlucky and has had bad experiences doesn't mean every single woman in the universe is the same.<br>  <br>  I reckon you should pretend all those bad experiences never happened and just move on. You would find some women are absolutely brilliant. If you're not attracted to women anymore you can always go for men. In our society discrimination is, slowly decreasing so don't be afraid to give it a go. <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|f4uYkNwkaa	well women are mean and not nice so you shouldunt get over it.|`|AA10202389	I probably wouldn't get in to a fight either. Maybe some people have to learn the hard way. They would never listen. I'm told that often women will even jump you if you try to help and if you tried to help a man being hit by a woman he will probably kill you. I know what you should do, but no one pays much attention to answers. I think they just want to vent. Usually women don't want answers either, just to tell you their tale. They are perfectly capable to figure their situation out better than someone else can anyway.<br>  Well, here's the thing, whether you get it or not and get it working, testing show that women have 30% more intuition than men. That means men have 70% of what women have. That's a weakness, but 70% is some talent and you should develop it until you have more than them and then you're 'the man', believe it or not. Also more information about people and emotions. Get the basics on Emotional Intelligence. It's use in business, on job applications, in families and family counseling and in sports, so it's really handy and it help develop intuition which Einstein said was the only real valuable thing. Oprah, Bush, Obama and everyone you can think of uses it. If you test your intuitions, that still small voice or even gut reactions, you will fix any mis-communication with the whole brain as sometimes we mix our thoughts with whole brain thinking. Also emotions have thoughts behind them so it's all logical. If the thoughts are wrong the feelings and gut reactions are wrong and unsettling. That's the secret to life and the secret behind the movie 'The Secret'. It's condensed so it's your access to a universe inside that has a map of the universe outsize, but is more intelligent and interesting. I don't think anyone takes me up on this, but you will find yourself able to pick the women you want, just avoid some, because most of them will approach you. You also access the genius inside, some websites are selling the information that I'm telling you for nothing. There's a lot of free information on trans4mind.com for a good start, or continue to suffer and be ignorant like those you speak of. LOL I'm always here to help it you get stuck on your journey.

Those who rebelled against God and man can never become good even after their death. Our prayers will help many of them to a very great extent to become justified before God.

LuN1unJ3aa	It depends how young. If you are talking about a teen about to finish high school, then a question about one's philosophies is probably okay. I had this happen to me in my senior year in high school, when our college english teacher asked us to write our philosophy of life. He gave us a bunch of pertinent questions, including what was God like? How we viewed God and so on. He also asked us what made us get up in the morning (and not because our parents made us do this). This was in 1962 and it really got me to thinking about things.<br>  <br>  But if you are talking about someone younger than, say, 16 or so, then I would say you probably shouldn't. Religious or not, they really aren't old enough to start giving serious thoughts about their philosophy of life.|`|UinOWcMUaa	yeah -- not wise ask someone who has been walking in the Lord for awhile :)|`|lDEGaK7Laa	People either believe in god(s) or they don't. People don't suddenly become believers when they reach a certain age.|`|WjSJBWl7aa	Did you know that on a persons 18th birthday, the meaning of life suddenly comes to them?<br>  <br>  Just because they are young doesn't mean they are ignorant. Some children have been to hell and back spiritually, some don't know what 'religion' even means. <br>  <br>  I'm seventeen. Does that mean my opinion is not valid for six more months?<br>  <br>  Perhaps you're middle aged [I'm guessing]. What if I said that asking a middle aged non religious person about god is useless?<br>  <br>  Everyone is different. Don't make the mistake of boxing everyone into groups - smart and dumb. Enlightened or unenlightened. It is extremely close minded and will get you no where in life.<br>  <br>  But how would I know right?|`|aHEwm3QLaa	I am getting tired of arrogant Christians.<br>  <br>  "Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise <br>  as false,  and by the rulers as useful."|`|84gK4XlHaa	Pretty much.  The inverse to that is that they're just too damned sure about it.  They feel that their 15 years have given them a good grasp on the whole spirituality thing.|`|u93oneUXaa	Asking a non religious person about God is stupid because they aren't religious. Asking a young child about God is also stupid because they don't know about the theory of God or the theories that say God doesn't exist. All you would do by asking a child this is make him ask you questions about it and then give him your beliefs.. which may or may not turn into the child's beliefs as well. <br>  <br>  How else would  a child learn about religion if it wasn't for everyone else throwing around theories? I doubt we could come up with the concept of God on our own if no one else in the world existed.|`|vb5oY7O6aa	true ppl ignore the inevitable.... religion is nothing but realizing your creator and respect and follow His prophets...its general guidance as to how life should be spent... religion is not a subject its the essence of life....its as much a part of us as our name and what we do....maybe deeper than that...religion taught the wild man who bowed to everything he got afraid of or impressed with like the fire, the sea, the sun etc to respect himself by bowing only to One creator and stop murdering, decieving, bullying etc....over the time people mixed thier own ideas and thoughts in religious scriptures to make them so confusing that it became impossible for a normal person to follow them..... except for the last book which the Almighty himself promised to guard till the last day.....|`|tHbihIcuaa	there is no perfect age to talk about it, there is no wrong age.<br>  <br>  religion is a really complicated subject. its easier to just discuss how awesome certain foods are like cool whip and bacon.|`|cXXJVz64aa	It depends on the age.

4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	If it's English you have a problem with, you should post this to the language section.  But I'll answer anyway.<br>  <br>  Lack of belief means simply not having a certain belief in something.  "Disbelief" implies an assertive claim that the said thing does not exist.<br>  <br>  For example, I have a disbelief in Santa Claus.  I assert that he is a fictional character.  I assert that there is no jolly guy in a red suit who lives at the north pole, makes presents for all the good gentile boys and girls, delievers them all on the same night on a magic sleigh, etc.  A kid in China however may have a "lack of belief" in Santa, if she never even heard of the whole concept of Santa Claus before.  <br>  <br>  To make another analogy, one could be "apolitical" (having no interest in government politics) without being "anarchistic" (want to have no government).|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	semantics . describe your usage or context . either they are the same or they are used differently . this is the incessant nature of the english language and that of thought quite often as well.we fail to explicate as we go.|`|EHjux4OFaa	lack of belief = "I dont give a sh*t" <br>  <br>  disbelief= "man what a bullsh*t"
T3A7haiJaa	You have to take this break to gain perspective. <br>  You are too tired, too scared to make your relationship work.<br>  Of course you love each other, but it isn't enough.|`|HCL7FpTqaa	It's so hard to ever regain that magical feeling once it's been lost.  What you need to address is why you keep breaking up.  If you care enough--make it work and tell each other that breaking up is NOT an option if this is important to you.|`|aLl5RGetaa	i think it will work but as i already said that it depends on ur relationship conditions!
urUp4bZiaa	You have to think, by taking a break again are you just repeating the on again off again cycle? You should sit down with your ex and tell them that either you have a relationship with them or you leave each other alone for awhile.. you should tell them what you expect from a relationship with them, what you are willing to give in a relationship, and what about the past has hurt you.. what they could do to fix it.. what you have done to hurt them and how you are going to fix it. Relationships require work and communication so if the two of you can figure those things out together and then actually follow through on them and maybe make a special time each week for something you two can do where you would have the chance to talk that would be good.  If you do talk and decide that it just can't work out, that there's nothing that can be done to fix the past in one person's mind (which happens) then you need to spend time away from each other and realize life goes on and you will meet someone new, it will be hard though.  Good luck|`|fe4bb1e462c1b1964d0d8e86a7ed06d2aa	A good relationship is a safe haven, a comfortable place to live, not a prison from which one is forever trying to escape.|`|2w6OOIWwaa	This doesn't sound like a very healthy "relationship" at all.  Of course you're both "always afraid that something will go wrong again" -- because it's happened many times already.<br>  <br>  It immediately occurred to me that you're both remaining sort of together simply because you don't want to be alone -- you're familiar enough with each other to have some semblance of comfortability.  But it's rather obvious that you're not compatible in the long run.  Either that, or neither of you have the flexibility for the give-and-take that all relationships require -- every relationship experiences minor stresses and irritations at times, so diplomacy is always necessary to weather the rough patches.<br>  <br>  I don't think that this quasi-relationship is going to give you much satisfaction in the long run.  I recommend just being friends, and search for true love elsewhere.|`|aLl5RGetaa	i have already said that its right but it is better if you handle this with care!

I had just begun a new job, was busy working in my cubicle when I, literally, 'sensed' him approaching.  All I saw was a blur pass my doorway and then the top of his head as he passed by.  I thought to myself, "Wasn't 'that' strange?" and continued working.  As he approached my office on his way back, I looked up just as he walked by the doorway.  DAMN!  THAT MAN IS AWESOME!  I 'had to' get up, walk to the doorway and look down the hall.  He was about twenty feet or so away when he turned halfway around and shot me the most HANDSOME SMILE I've ever seen.  Trust me...I KNEW instantly...  That was in the Fall of '89 and I am SO in love with him it just gets better every day...  He is the most awesome man I've ever met...WOW!  He feels it too...we know when the other one of us is near and we find our thoughts and our conversations match up like a jigsaw puzzle...  I'd always hoped for a 'true' soulmate...that there really was such a thing...and, now, for over twenty years I can honestly say, "Yes, there are soulmates...and you WILL know when you've met them"...

XuhQS9wsaa	Ew. Not true. Fat men are not accepted. Being fat means you are unhealthy. And if you are unhealthy, you are lazy. And laziness is unattractive. I don't know how you can tell your husband to change but if he thinks its ok to waste away like he will always have you, its not. You, on the other hand, sound like a hot momma. Size 4! Nice. Keep it up because being healthy makes you feel happy anyways. I am also into being healthy -- going to the gym and eating healthy foods. Im 20. But I won't date no fat boy. Sorry fat boys.|`|6sJhoXAAaa	It's just like older men still being attractive to women, and most older women not being attractive to many men.  It's not fair, and I do agree with the answer about it being more in America than anywhere else, but that's how it goes.<br>  <br>  Just a note:  I do know a couple of guys in their 30s that dye their hair and spend a lot of time in the gym -- so not all of them think they're such hot stuff the way they are.|`|M1u6fdZCaa	Most women will accept men even if they start letting themselves go...if we were to let ourselves go, they would be looking to find someone else.

Perhaps you should arouse some jealousy *hint hint* (Not hinting any innuendo...)|`|TjPwxbuJaa	I'm sorry, but I don't think it's acceptable for men to be fat either. I am gay and a fat man is always a huge turn-off for me. I work hard at the gym to keep a toned and lean body. Of course, straight men can get away with so much more because most women just don't seem to care how their men look.<br>  Good for you by staying fit!|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	I believe women are viewed as objects to some, them being fat is like ruining a good car, its just not acceptable.|`|tBXn97NNaa	Because women are objectified in the media.<br>  <br>  Same for gay men unforutunately.|`|7q78bhAaaa	I don't think its acceptable for both sexes to get obesed. It's just a health risk and it looks terrible when you can't walk or get in your car cause you are so fat.|`|qTRzRi8gaa	This falls into the realm of theory, but this is what I think:<br>  <br>  Our society basically says women have the monopoly on sexuality.  Women are sexy, men are just men.  Proof?  Take most facets of the media.  Axe commercials, beer commercials, etc.  Over sexualized women are acceptable for mass consumption.  Can you find much of a mirror example for men?  Over sexualized men are not seen as acceptable for mass consumption as their female counterparts.<br>  <br>  This reflects a social reality, or some value or belief that is perpetuated by our society.<br>  <br>  Women are sexualized way more than men are.  Female bisexuals are much more acceptable than male bisexuals.  Generally the idea goes:  women are allowed to be seen as sexy.  Men, too, of course, but it is to a *much* smaller degree.<br>  <br>  If men were regarded in the same light, it would be a bigger deal if men were obsese.  You notice when men are highly sexualized, obesity becomes a much bigger issue.  I view men in a sexual light, you can bet obesity is a pretty significant turn off for me.  Since men are sexualized in my eyes, I care much more if men get fat than I do if women get fat...
ZzYy2szvaa	If they want to hold hands - that's fine by me.

If she seems affended, remind her how much you care about her and tell her you can make for it in private.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think I'd have the guts to even hold hands, but the idea is so appealing.  I definitely want to kiss a guy in public, even if it's just once, before I die! Haha - "list of things to do before I die".  Hopefully when I'm older I'll have more guts to do it.|`|AA11615514	My wife isn't as comfortable with PDAs as I am. I think if you like it and your partner doesn't you might try compromising by holding hands or sharing a quick peck. If I see a couple (straight or gay/lesbian) showing affection in front of me I think it's sweet as long as they aren't all over each other. Public groping or french kissing can be a little gross especially if there is a chance kids might be around.|`|akvrwpywaa	I find it distasteful and annoying, whether it be between a man and a man, a man and a woman, or a woman or a woman.|`|2gTgw9o9aa	i dont mind pda. and i dont tyhink theresa anything wrong with gay people displaying it because they consider their relationships just as normal as ours.|`|36b213c16926132fde2d00722cbf60d3aa	I think that some public displays of affection are ok, but I would not like to see 2 people making out.

More than that, get a room.|`|1c4c4792abe212c6cffc345fbd36daadaa	It's funny you should ask this, because this exact subject has been on my mind. I'm in a new relationship. I'm a lesbian and she's bi, and was only out to half the people she knew where as I'm out and open to everyone. Now she's pretty much open to everyone but sometimes when we're out, I feel like she feels the need to let everyone know we're a couple. I have never had a prob with pda as long as its tasteful. I don't mind a peck or holding hands but when she smacks me on the behind in public I have to let her know that we are not putting on a show for anyone and do not have to prove anything to anyone.  This is the same for gay people and straight people.|`|ti9ZlNJ4aa	i think it's embarresing for the people showing the PDA|`|Xgm680dCaa	i personally have no problem with kissing<br>   groping each other uncontrollably that should stay  private|`|WBwlKbLeaa	I think holding hands or a peck is fine but any more then that needs to be saved for their own privacy. I would just let them know up front  that I was not into PDA.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	It makes me feel good inside.<br>  <br>  But if it makes you uncomfortable, you need to say so.|`|nisfxpXHaa	Holding hands, a quick peck kiss, a hand on their knee.

My only reason for possibly supporting this idea is that God is supposed to be smart. If he is so smart, he would write a book on a level that humans could understand, if they took the time to study it. The unicorns and satyrs thing is actually faulty translations (idiot translators). Knowledge in of itself isn't considered sin, it was the knowledge of good and evil that was considered sin. In fact, in Hebrew theology, it is supposed that Adam was the smartest being created by God, second only to Lucifer (believe it or not). But yes, I don't agree with 90% of the way Christians interpret the Bible. It's funny, because I'm not even a Christian, and I believe God is absolutely good, while most people believe God is half good, half bad. They get this teaching mixed up with the fact that God released his power into the earth. In short, this power is what karma is. What goes around comes around. So, the idiot translators, again, labeled this power LORD. So now all the Christians think that God is out to get them, when it's just his power. It's like electricity. It can help you if you plug in a refrigerator, but it can harm you if you stick your finger in the socket. So if you do the right stuff (help others, good works, all that), you get good karma. You do bad stuff, well, you know. Please send me an e-mail to let me know if this helped you.

Why would you think there's only one accepted view of the Bible?  I mean, to the Christians there's usually only one view per denomination, but almost every single religion thinks its got the only right answer.  Let me tell you something, when theres a group of people, and everyone thinks they are right and everyone else is wrong there can be only two possible outcomes.  Either one of them really is right, or they're all wrong.  <br>  <br>  You mention the occult, but you don't seem to realize that plenty of practices deemed 'occult' use the Bible just as much as organized Christianity.  Go google gnosticism or kaballah.  Organized religion is just what it sounds like.  Sounds like there might be unorganized religion out there too, right?  You don't have to belong to a church to be a Christian.  Being a Christian isn't about getting together once a week to compare clothes.  <br>  <br>  There's plenty of wisdom in The Bible.  Lots of people believe in it metaphorically.  There's plenty of people that don't believe for example, that a snake was literally talking to Eve.  Use whatever interpretation you want.  If you belong to a group, just make sure you agree with them.

The exact composition of the Bible is dependent on the religious traditions of specific denominations. Modern Judaism generally recognizes a single set of canonical books known as the Tanakh, or Hebrew or Jewish Bible. It comprises three parts: the Torah ("Teaching", also known as the Pentateuch or "Five Books of Moses"), the Prophets, and the Writings. It was primarily written in Hebrew with some small portions in Aramaic.<br>  <br>  The Christian Bible includes the same books as the Tanakh (referred to in this context as the Old Testament), but usually in a different order, together with twenty-seven specifically Christian books collectively known as the New Testament. Those were originally written in Greek. Among some traditions, the Bible includes books that were not accepted in other traditions, often referred to as apocryphal. Eastern Orthodox Churches use all of the books that were incorporated into the Septuagint, to which they add the earliest Greek translation of the Deuterocanonicals; Roman Catholics include seven of these books in their canon; and many Protestant Bibles follow the modern Jewish canon, excluding the additional books. Some editions of the Christian Bible have a separate Biblical apocrypha section for books not considered canonical.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	Ha Ha. Unicorns and satyrs?

Last time I checked murder is a felony. In addition last time I checked the demands of justice cannot go unmet in any legal system. And finally, no judge would take a convicted felon's sentence upon himself in order to meet the justice demand for the felon.<br>    However the Judge Jesus did. Being criminal felons in God's legal system of course includes more than hating another which all have done. All have also lied and broken other laws. Saving Jesus which would not be in anyone's power despite the amount of "fire power" at his or her disposal anyway. <br>    If it were, it would be the cruelest act possible in the universe causing no one to escape the unquestionable, inescapable demands of justice that are not even in the ball-park of unfair under God's court and legal system.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	NO ONE could have done this because so it was written that Jesus would come and die for us, so it was done.

He is there now with the earth as a footstool at his feet awaiting that appointed time (Armageddon) when he will return a 2nd time and exact God's war against all wicked humans, Satan and his demons and removing all sin in the earth -- the last sin to be removed is death itself.<br>  <br>  So it was written aforetime and will by God, let NO MAN undo or change.

We have found updates since 1960 that helped us considerably in Greek text.  The older Greek copies gave us some new meanings of some words and helped us to better understand what was being said.  It did not change the plan for salvation a bit, though.  As we are told - His word will never pass away.  We will always have the truth.<br>  <br>  I said both and should have added Aramaic to the list for the original languages.<br>  <br>  The true translations use words in the vernacular of the day when it was translated.  Some words in these languages takes several words because there is not a word in English for every word in Greek, etc.  The words must be translated into the thought from the words and not translated word for word.  The language structure is totally different.  <br>  <br>  The way to really understand some things is to delve into the original languages enough to translate the bible from the original languages.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26.

The reason being, is they're like humans with their logics gone. So think... you're standing on a roof with one ladder going up. Replace all the zombies with humans. Will they find a way up? Yes, they understand the use of a ladder. Now, pretend the ladder's not there. Unless they try to scale a pipe, they won't be able to get up. <br>  <br>  Now, put the zombies back in place. Even if the ladder were there, they wouldn't be able to figure out how to get up. They wouldn't have the common sense to scale the pipe or find a way up, so the logical answer is NO.<br>  <br>  Still, #3 zombies can be confused with similar, fast moving zombies, that can scale things like gorillas.

If it is the classic zombie, then the only time in which they can climb will be the first few days after being zombified, in which they will be just as fast, strong, and coordinated as they were in life. After they begin to decay and muscular atrophy begins to set in from lack of proteins (since the digestive system no longer works) then they would quickly degrade from being "fast-movers" to "slow shamblers", and their motor skills would become seriously impaired. Climbing anything like a sheer wall or pulling themselves up to a ledge or second floor would be out of the question.|`|1JPvPypQaa	zombies cant climb there cant run they cant think there are just zombies their brains can fire enough messages to get the arms and legs moving in coordination to climb. They also don't have superhuman strength they just use all the muscle they had with endless endurance.

Oh my god, that would be so much fun.<br>  <br>  I'd have to say #3, like in Left 4 Dead. Because facing unkillable zombies is no fun. I mean, sure, if you have one chained up in your back yard, it'd be fun to throw stuff at and never have it die... but if you're at a point with a machine-gun in hand and thousands of brainless zombies to kill, what would you want?<br>  <br>   Would you want ones that take an unloading of a whole clip? or would you want one that can't take much more than a few bullets? honestly, mowing down zombies would be a lot more fun if you can take down a lot at once.<br>  <br>  #2 would be fun if you had 5 zombies in a fence box and they couldn't do anything about it... then you could spend your time shooting them and messing with their heads.<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  buffywaldie, it's all in good fun.|`|AA11605393	What a dumb question...thanks for the 2 points|`|72UTm6qAaa	It sounds as though number three would be the easiest to take out with my twelve gauge, so I'm going to go with it.

ea0c0b2ee1d6ac591c368a39ad677b76aa	Hello there, <br>  well, first i know that fasting is a way of cleansing our bodies, and spiritually speaking to clear the corrosion, whether it is sin, bad health, fat, and all the things in the way of giving and receiving understandable messages.   Praying is talking to the lord, and acknowledging him, worship him, and give up something that i am accustomed to or desire..<br>  <br>  I EXPERIENCE PRAYER, AS ME REPORTING TO OUR GOD, LETTING HIM KNOW ALL THE THINGS IN MY LIFE AND TRUSTING HIM WITH IDEAS, DREAMS, PROBLEMS, REQUESTS, AND INCLUDING HIM IN EVERY AREA OF MY LIFE AND TRUSTING HIM..<br>  THEN I USE MEDITATION,,,,TO LISTEN TO HIM, AND LISTEN FOR HIM TO GIVE ME MY ANSWERS<br>  <br>  ALSO, THE FASTING IS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE AS A WAY TO PRAY, AND DEEPLY COMMIT TO THAT JOURNEY.. AND FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT, OK BUT DONT FAST, WITH EXPECTATIONS OF WANTING YOUR REWARD AS A TRADE OFF.. AND THE REST,, I AM STILL LEARNING..AND WILL ALWAYS BE SEARCHING FOR JESUS. MY LORD AND SAVIOR|`|PwD3slrTaa	Just came off a two-day fast.<br>  <br>  The rules are whatever you want them to be.  I've fasted from TV and the computer before.<br>  <br>  The typical way is to eat nothing and just drink water.  That has major health benefits but these things really should be done for spiritual reasons- instead of eating, pray and study the Bible.  Be hungrier for God than food.  That's the idea.<br>  <br>  And if you're not, then don't bother because your vain religious exercise would only be sin.  Or if you want to fast for health reasons, don't put it up as a religious thing.<br>  <br>  Now then.  Other fasts are there.<br>  <br>  I knew a 12 year old kid (seriously very Christian kid) who went on a 40-day fast where he ate nothing and drank juice.  I met a guy tonight who's done that for the last ELEVEN YEARS.  Honestly, I'm a very spiritual believer and those are both way way way way way out there for even me.<br>  <br>  Juice fasts are fine but I don't suggest doing that.  If you were in a spiritual position to do that, you wouldn't need to ask.<br>  <br>  Snacks ruin a fast though, both physically and spiritually.<br>  <br>  For this last one, I drank a glass of orange juice just before and just after the fasting period.  (The first time by accident, then the second time it seemed like a good idea.  That may have stopped me from vomiting after scarfing down five pieces of fried chicken and three salads.... blush)|`|7608d8bbef666e373ac9050db58b0ce9aa	The rules apply only when you are fasting as a religious act. Islamic fasting is from early morning when colour white appears on the eastern horizon to sunset. Not even water is allowed, not to speak about sweets, little snacks.  Such fasting for three days in a month is very good for health.|`|FOZGMadaaa	Teaches discipline.|`|mA3ZAKVfaa	U allow the holy spirit to come into your life to become a better Christan, as you can only have water to substain your body, as you pray hard and meditate with the Lord's words and you pray for whatever your minds has on it , as you want to be beter in your life to help someone or to help your self to temptations thst come your way.<br>   Continue to fast , as it takes a matter of part of a day or night or could last week, or weeks, depending on the situtation of your circumstances. Have a very wonderful week, Love you!|`|3c0c8be5fca466eb221bf1bf02ddc784aa	As I understand it, it is essential to drink water during a fast. In addition, there are some medical conditions which also require the person fasting to not completely abstain from all food. <br>  Lastly, if you have a job where there is a level of danger present, e.g. driving a large truck, then you should restrict your fast to times when it is safe to do so.|`|ZCIc1lTSaa	fasting is usually from food.<br>  <br>  But there are no rules to fasting. It's whatever you feel God's calling you to fast.<br>  <br>  Fasting is a time where when you crave for what your fasting from that you turn to God in prayer.<br>  <br>  Also, the bible says some breakthroughs can only be acheived through Prayer and Fasting.|`|jbrhGTBBaa	Fasting is a dangerous way to test faith, health wise. Don't do it|`|dl97DmmYaa	The first rule is not to eat.<br>  The second is not to drink.<br>  The benefits are many.  It cleans the system.  It wipes out the toxins.

DITTKNmkaa	When Rome invaded Greece, they took over a lot of their religion. A lot of Roman god and goddesses are the same as Ancient Greece's, simply with their name changed.|`|1giK9hUhaa	In order to show their appreciation to the Gods and Oracles, the Greeks would perform a series of rituals, ceremonies, sacrifices and offerings as other forms of Paganism did. Sacrifices of animals; sheep, cows, goats, pigs and bulls were made, as well as the occasional human sacrifice as a present to the Gods. Chosen animals for sacrifice formed a procession, they were crowned, adorned, purified with water and sprinkled with barley. Many temples and shrines were also erected as a mark of respect and for a place to offer their sacrifices. It is obvious that the Greeks placed a lot of pride in their temples and shrines, for extensive time was taken to re-build, preserve and beautify them. Further evidence of the Greeks desire to please the Gods can be seen through their offerings. The Greeks offered such things as stone freezes, "gold vessels, wheat, wine and honey, milk, water and firstfruits." Prayers and hymns accompanied sacrifices and sometimes performances and other ritual acts followed such as dances or early forms of drama.

Leave the beer unopened there as an offering.  Go home a different route and never look back.<br>  <br>  Never think about it again.  If it pops in your head, follow it by the thought "I'm so happy it's gone!"

VY7dlcx7aa	Wow, really interesting question- afraid I don't really know the answer myself.  My guess is that American beliefs surrounding these animals stem from the British colonies, where lions were seen as noble and a symbol of royalty.  If I remember: Lions were always seen as brave and mighty; Unicorns were considered beautiful and rare, a symbol of beauty and grace, and dragons were considered powerful and almost vicious (often portrayed as evil in many stories- the Bible refers to the devil as a dragon in the book of Revelations).  Elephants are also seen as a symbol of power, but moreso of intelligence rather than bravery.  <br>  As for their interactions, I suppose what they symbolize would suggest that the dragon and the lion would certainly be at odds with one another due to their poweful nature.  The elephant of course might be a bit at odds with the other two titans, but I can't really see the Unicorn getting involved except as a comparison of opposites (being a gentle and kind creature).  Naturally, dragons and unicorns are not around today (or so they say) so these animals only interact in fairy tales, excepting the lion and the elephant, who can really be compared in real life.  Although lions and elephants generally leave each other alone, occasionally a rouge elephant will kill a lone lion or a particularly strong lion pride may attack a long elephant, suggesting a clash of power and ferocity.  As for the others, it's all a matter of cultural beliefs and historical influence :).|`|VLxU5112aa	Is this some new version of rock-paper-scissors you came up with?|`|rfAUXa0Paa	the seed's in your marijuana probably|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	Source?|`|faT4MyVkaa	All I know is that the Unicorn can be a prick at times.
1fe26507544360ab068d439532ac3f2daa	Yes I can confirm previous answer.

He replied:<br>  <br>  “As for women wearing pants or trousers, this is not permitted, even if she is on her own or in front of other women or her husband, except if she is in a closed room with her husband only. Apart from that, it is not permitted because it shows the details of her body and makes her get used to these clothes. So she is not permitted to wear these clothes at all.” (al-Nukhbah min al-Fataawaa al-Nisaa’iyyah, p. 30).<br>  <br>  Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen was also asked about the ruling on women wearing any kind of pants or trousers. He (may Allaah preserve him) answered:<br>  <br>  “I think that women should not wear trousers at all, even if there is no one with her apart from her husband, because this is imitating men. The ones who wear trousers are men, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed women who imitate men.” <br>  <br>  <br>  Majmoo’ Fataawaa wa Rasaa’il al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, part 12, p. 287|`|AA11336384	Wow.

A `myth' in our modern understanding is recognized as something which is not `true' - but that is not the ancient understanding of that word. Once upon a time a `myth' was a story which explained while it entertained and edified and which `explained' some sort of Truth about life. In other words, there was truth contained in the story one heard even though all of the details of that story may not have been, objectively or empirically, `True'. So, yes, we do need `sturdier mythology' as we grow older and the myths we believed when young wear out. But I think it should be recognized that the truths of the myths our younger selves believed are still truths; they just need stronger and more intricately designed vehicles to carry them as we age.|`|ZYOJQdjyaa	My opinion is that is is true.

Certain industries have hiring quotas, and that means a qualified man might be passed over for a job just because the other applicant is a woman.

2iAAczdyaa	For some reason a high percent of 16-30 year old women like jerks. Many women do not have good relationships with their fathers. Usually fathers are the first to show them how a man cares for them. A man cares by doing. A woman by her words. A man is direct. A woman is not. Insincere men can do one thing and say another Women hear what they want. but don't see what is done.. Usuallly women in their 30s or 40s have wised up and would make completely different choices than the younger ones..|`|U7sBZKUuaa	You may be on to something there.|`|eow59EaEaa	I think another reason is because there are some women who are attracted by looks only (or mostly). More attractive men "can be" jerks or feel they can be because they have women falling at thier feet. So they act that way and these women will take it because the man is "hot".<br>  <br>  I also feel that women who have self esteem problems allow themselves to be treated this way because they feel they cannot do any better and a vicious circle continues.<br>  <br>  I personally cannot stand men like that.

Feel yourself being "cleaned" from the inside out.<br>  <br>  If you want protection, envisage a bubble or circle around your body; use whichever colour feels strongest with you.

AA11786648	This isn't a fair question because everybody has a different idea of what is beautiful.  Just because someone doesn't find your asianess attractive doesn't mean they are racist it just means they are not attracted to that look.  It doesn't mean they don't value you as a human being. Also if you are not attraced to everyone in your race it doesn't make you racist against your own people. <br>  You shouldn't let that make you feel insecure.  Not everyone in the world will think your beautiful and then again you will get a lot of people who lust after you but don't base your insecurity on your race and looks.  Think about yourself you are not attracted to everybody out there . <br>  The media is going to put whoever has the MOST buying power up on the screen .  They cater to money.  If by western you mean white then in a white majority country, yes you will see more whites it is natural. When the market demands diversity on television you will see it change.|`|042huvxmaa	Speaking solely for Asian females: you have a unique beauty (and look) that no female of another race can emulate.<br>  <br>  Those who recognize this fact are enlightened; those who do not are ignorant.<br>  <br>  Having said that, I hope I have settled your doubts. Be well.|`|LUY72MMYaa	No, I do not view Asians as unattractive.  <br>  <br>  Of course there are unattractive people in every race, but as a whole we are all beautiful.<br>  <br>  Don't let the media/models/racists/haters bring you down.

xw55lwscaa	SIKHISM<br>  Sikhism is a non-Semitic, Aryan, non-Vedic religion. It is a religion that has the sixth largest following in the world. Some consider it as an offshoot of Hinduism. It was founded by Guru Nanak at the end of the 15th century. It originated in the area of Pakistan and North West India called Punjab, meaning the land of the five rivers. Guru Nanak was born in a Kshatriya (warrior caste) Hindu family but was very strongly influenced by Islam and Muslims.<br>  I          DEFINITION OF SIKH AND SIKHISM<br>    The word ‘Sikh’ is derived from the word sisya meaning disciple or follower. Sikhism is a religion of ten Gurus, the first Guru being Guru Nanak and the tenth and the last being Guru Gobind Singh. The sacred book of Sikhism is Sri Guru Granth also called Adi Granth Sahib.<br>    <br>  THE FIVE – ‘K’s<br>  Every Sikh is supposed to keep the following five ‘K’s, which also serve to identify him as a Sikh:<br>  i. Kesh – uncut hair. <br>  ii. Kanga – comb; used to keep the hair clean. <br>  iii. Kada – metal or steel bangle; for strength and self-restraint. <br>  iv. Kirpan – dagger; for self-defence. <br>  v. Kaccha – special knee length underwear or under-drawer for agility. <br>    <br>  II         <br>  CONCEPT OF GOD IN SIKHISM:<br>    MULMANTRA: THE FUNDAMENTAL CREED OF SIKHISM<br>  The best definition that any Sikh can give regarding the concept of God in Sikhism is to quote the Mulmantra – the fundamental creed of Sikhism, which occurs at the beginning of Sri Guru Granth Sahib.<br>  It is mentioned in Sri Guru Granth Sahib, volume 1 Japuji, the first verse:<br>  "There exists but one God, who is called The True, The Creator, Free from fear and hate, Immortal, Not begotten, Self-Existent, Great and Compassionate."<br>  Sikhism is a monotheistic Religion<br>  Sikhism enjoins its followers to practise strict monotheism. It believes in only One Supreme God who is, in the unmanifest form, called Ek Omkara.<br>  In the manifest form He is called Omkara and has several attributes such as:<br>  Kartar – The Creator<br>  Akal – The Eternal<br>  Sattanama – The Holy Name<br>  Sahib – The Lord<br>  Parvardigar – The Cherisher<br>  Rahim – The Merciful<br>  Karim – The Benevolent<br>  <br>  He is also called Wahe Guru – the One true God.<br>  Besides Sikhism being strictly monotheistic, it also does not believe in Avataravada – the doctrine of incarnation. Almighty God does not incarnate Himself in what is known as Avatara. Sikhism is also strongly against idol worship.<br>  <br>  Guru Nanak was influenced by Sant Kabir<br>  Guru Nanak was influenced by the sayings of Sant Kabir so much that several chapters of Sri Guru Granth Sahib contain couplets of Sant Kabir. <br>  One of the famous couplets of Sant Kabir is:<br>  "Dukh mein sumirana sabh karein<br>  Sukh mein karein na koya<br>  Jo sukh mein sumirana karein<br>  To dukh kaye hoye?"<br>  "In times of trouble, God is remembered by all<br>  But none remembers Him during peace and happiness.<br>  If God is remembered in good times of happiness<br>  Why should trouble occur?"<br>  Compare this with the following verse of the Qur’an:<br>  "When some trouble toucheth man,<br>  He crieth unto his Lord,<br>  Turning to Him in repentance:<br>  But when He bestoweth <br>  A favour upon him<br>  As from Himself, <br>  (Man) doth forget what he cried<br>  And prayed for before,<br>  And he doth set up<br>  Rivals unto Allah."<br>  [Al-Qur’an 39:8]<br>  The Sikh scriptures therefore emphasise monotheism and God-consciousness.|`|e30cd21479ba61083d65bb804d7193edaa	Most religions derive attributes to one another, so it wouldn't be a surprise. Jews, Christians and Muslims all share basically the same ideas, with only a few differences. Overall though, same principles.

Plus there are usually a bunch a rouches in the parking lot left by the homeless that I scavenge, so thats good.
xnsU60hhaa	First of all, since you don't own the car clear, the check will be made out to you AND the finance company. Since your deductible is $1000, the check will be made out for $6500 (they have valued your car at $7500 less the $1000 deductible) and you will still owe the finance company $2000 on your totalled car. If you have made any improvements to the car (better tires, stereo, any optional equipment) you can argue with the insurance on the true value of the car. Talk to your local agent and get him to work with the company for you.|`|dvQYaRNDaa	I think they pay the loan to you in the form of a check.<br>  <br>  Yes it's me Martic.|`|t3eJ0Y3caa	It depends on the insurance you have. If you owed 8500 on it, it should have been covered entirely. If not, they should have offered you "GAP" insurance to cover the difference of the cars worth and your loan. Perhaps your deductible was subtracted? Or late fees on the loan? My insurance would pay the loan company to pay the loan off, as the title is not clear and has the finance companies name in the policy. Good luck!<br>  Yes!, It is the deductible why they are giving you 1000 less!!|`|ND1nFEWSaa	you should include  year make and model for some real help<br>  to check book value<br>  <br>  Ask the ins co to reimburse you for the sales tax value as well, if it was not your fault, THEY MUST PAY THIS and sometimes in all cases they must pay this expense<br>  <br>  re post question with vehicle information|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	Generally they will give you the $7500 and take possession of the vehicle.

Although his client range is varied, he is a controversial figure for often representing unpopular clients (such as those accused or convicted of crimes) and acting as an agent to people selling "kiss-and-tell" stories to tabloid newspapers.<br>  <br>  A traditional Labour supporter, Clifford openly vowed to bring down the government of John Major because he personally felt, due to family reasons (his one daughter suffers from juvenile idiopathic arthritis), that the National Health Service was mismanaged. While he is primarily known for helping to bring damaging allegations to light, he insists that today most of his work is concerned with concealment of stories.

However, the school system in the United States lags academically behind all developed countries for just this reason. We try to give children opportunities and values at the cost of learning academics.

A woman should not show her beauty or adornments except what appears by uncontrolled factors such as the wind blowing her clothes, and the head covers should be drawn so as to cover the hair, the neck and the bosom. Islam has no fixed standard as to the style of dress or type of clothing that Muslims must wear. <br>  <br>  Woman should conceal her body and hair from a man who is non-Mahram, and as an obligatory precaution, she should conceal herself even from a Na-baligh boy who is able to discern between good and evil, and could probably be sexually excited. But she can leave her face and hands upto wrists uncovered in the presence of Na-Mahram, as long as it does not lead him to casting a sinful, evil glance or her to doing something forbidden; for in both these cases, she must cover them.|`|h6vqu7mjaa	Making the decision to conceal most parts of the body for a woman who is created to be the epitome of beauty is not easy. It takes allot of soul searching , . It also takes allot allot of courage and perseverance to appear plain where visibly beautiful women are coveted and heavily commercialized. <br>  The Islamic dress code , for one teaches that women's beauty and sexual allure is not for everybody to see but rather to be protected and treasured by the individual. <br>  The word for the Islamic veil is Hijab which comes from hiaba, meaning to conceal or hide from view. it encompasses not only the covering of the body but behavior , manners and speech. <br>  the feminist movement have always made the veil to be synonymous with oppression. They are viewed as oppressed for the reasons of the west but cannot offer anything better in the way of manner, or appropriate dress. In past civilizations women of honorable position in society wore long and loose clothing and covered their hair. <br>  I am a woman that wears a veil, I feel that it is a protection and an honorable thing. Men and women are equal but we are different . Men are also required to lower their gaze, not to stare at women for reasons of their nature.|`|OrJZdZa7aa	I do not use hijab regularly, head scarves only.  But I do dress modestly.

There are many women around the world who PREFER to dress conservatively in modest clothes that cover them well, and there's NOTHING wrong with that.<br>  <br>  However, Hijaab the Arabic word is more specifically applied to the forms of covering which Muslim women in particular wear, particularly the headscarf. The niqaab most commonly refers to the face veil, which is NOT mandatory but which a number of women still wear by choice out a very very strong level of commitment to their faith.<br>  <br>  Many Muslim women who may not adopt the Hijab per se, still choose to dress modestly, in that the clothes worn should not reveal the legs above the ankles, be sleeveless or skin-tight (the kinds of clothes that "leave very little to the imagination", in fact), be transparent or see-through, or put one's feminine assets too-prominent display (decolletage, cleavage, too bust-defining, midriff-baring etc). Although it confuses many women who are not of the Muslim faith as to why Muslim women choose to dress that way, I assure you there are a number of plausible (especially to those of us that follow them, at least) reasons for the way we dress.<br>  <br>  Firstly, it is prescribed by the faith we follow to dress modestly, and that's why we are required as people committed to that faith on whatever level, to follow this prescription, pure and simple. Each Muslim woman may do it on her own level though. Some choose to cover completely everything, and every possible expose-able part of the body when going out with hijab, niqaab, loose-fitting outer clothing like abayas, coats, gloves, boots and even dark glasses to cover the eyes. Some, on the other hand may choose to wear the hijab/scarf only. Some may wrap the scarf very securely, covering the hair absolutely, while some may wear it more loosely-draped. Some may not wear it at all, going instead for covering just the chest by draping a veil/stole/scarf across their front and not on their head. Some don't do even that, and instead wear loosely-tailored tunic-shirts or modest tops with ankle-length bottoms, whether they be pants, trousers, shalwars, or long dresses/skirts. Still others, the more 'Westernized' crowd, even go for ensembles like capris, short, fitted tees and what-have-you, but then again, I guess that's their choice. The basic prescription is still there to be followed, whether they do or not is upto the individual/s.<br>  <br>  Secondly, those who strictly adhere to the Hijab, besides just 'dressing modestly' may do so due to a deeper level of commitment to their faith. The hijab to them, is as much the identity of a Muslim woman, as the turban might be to a Sikh man, the habit and wimple may be to a Christian nun, the Bindi to a Hindu woman, the robe to a Christian pastor, the Yarmulk to the devout Jewish man and so on..It is like a symbol and indentity, intrinsic and extrinsic, in one. Just like the uniforms of certain occupations (police, nurses, armed forces, students etc) remind their wearers of their code of conduct while 'on duty', so is the Hijab an ever-present reminder to the faithful Muslim woman to behave in a befitting manner whenever she goes out. This includes guarding herself against unwanted advances and respecting her body by not putting it on ostentatious display for all and sundry. Of course, this does NOT mean (as some may think) that she can't look pretty or wear nice clothes. She doesn't have to wear a potato-sack, she just has to make sure that her choice of clothing, whatever it may be; be it a dress, skirt, pants and tops, jeans and shirts, ethnic clothing like a caftan, shalwar kamiz, etc, covers her properly. Other than that, she is free to dress herself and tastefully adorn herself as she chooses and as she sees fit, provided that adornment is not the flaunting, look-at-me, in-your-face kind.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, the prescribed modest garb has been put into place in Islam to accord woman with a higher level of respect. It shows the men around her that she is NOT an object of delectation, but a human being to be respected and admired for her intelligence (and not just for her body), ona  level which equates with any man. After all, MEN in business settings, when in formal-wear suits and ties, are pretty much covered from neck-to-ankle, aren't they? Why not give women the same option? Why make her wear a tight skirt as part of HER busines apparel and require her to look ornamental at all times? Men don't have to worry about someone trying to look up THEIR skirts, now do they?<br>  <br>  Fourthly, it does in fact keep the opposite gender, shall we say, more focused where they SHOULD be, rather than where they shouldn't. This does not mean that men's intelligence is being insulted or whatever. It is just c|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Yes I do. I am a hijabi woman who freely chose to wear it. The main reason is to please God, since it was said in the Qu'ran ..."tell your women to veil themselves "....<br>  And it's out of modesty.  Wearing the hijab is not just covering my hair but also a way of dressing. I am modestly dressed and it reminds me constantly of who I am and I save my beauty for God and my husband ;)

Not all Westerners sport this view so it's hard to lump us all together.  America traditionally has supported Israel immensely, loves the Jewish G-d but does an occasional bow to some other political cause or idol that jeapordizes things.  Not everyone in America gets it, including the leadership, but all in all up to this point it's been a great religious relationship.  <br>  <br>  As far as people fearing that Jews are powerful, that is a myth or a misguided projection onto us.

dcdc455147898a9c3841fdeb4e5d2d60aa	No.......Is evolution really scientific?<br>  <br>  The “scientific method” is as follows: Observe what happens; based on those observations, form a theory as to what may be true; test the theory by further observations and by experiments; and watch to see if the predictions based on the theory are fulfilled. Is this the method followed by those who believe in and teach evolution?<br>  <br>  Astronomer Robert Jastrow says: “To their chagrin [scientists] have no clear-cut answer, because chemists have never succeeded in reproducing nature’s experiments on the creation of life out of nonliving matter. Scientists do not know how that happened.”—The Enchanted Loom: Mind in the Universe (New York, 1981), p. 19.<br>  <br>  Evolutionist Loren Eiseley acknowledged: “After having chided the theologian for his reliance on myth and miracle, science found itself in the unenviable position of having to create a mythology of its own: namely, the assumption that what, after long effort, could not be proved to take place today had, in truth, taken place in the primeval past.”—The Immense Journey (New York, 1957), p. 199.<br>  <br>  According to New Scientist: “An increasing number of scientists, most particularly a growing number of evolutionists . . . argue that Darwinian evolutionary theory is no genuine scientific theory at all. . . . Many of the critics have the highest intellectual credentials.”—June 25, 1981, p. 828.<br>  <br>  Physicist H. S. Lipson said: “The only acceptable explanation is creation. I know that this is anathema to physicists, as indeed it is to me, but we must not reject a theory that we do not like if the experimental evidence supports it.” (Italics added.)—Physics Bulletin, 1980, Vol. 31, p. 138.<br>  <br>  The introduction to the centennial edition of Darwin’s Origin of Species (London, 1956) says: “As we know, there is a great divergence of opinion among biologists, not only about the causes of evolution but even about the actual process. This divergence exists because the evidence is unsatisfactory and does not permit any certain conclusion. It is therefore right and proper to draw the attention of the non-scientific public to the disagreements about evolution.”—By W. R. Thompson, then director of the Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control, Ottawa, Canada.<br>  <br>  “A century after Darwin’s death, we still have not the slightest demonstrable or even plausible idea of how evolution really took place—and in recent years this has led to an extraordinary series of battles over the whole question. . . . A state of almost open war exists among the evolutionists themselves, with every kind of [evolutionary] sect urging some new modification.”—C. Booker (London Times writer), The Star, (Johannesburg), April 20, 1982, p. 19.<br>  <br>  The scientific magazine Discover said: “Evolution . . . is not only under attack by fundamentalist Christians, but is also being questioned by reputable scientists. Among paleontologists, scientists who study the fossil record, there is growing dissent.”—October 1980, p. 88.<br>  <br>  What view does the fossil record support?<br>  <br>  Darwin acknowledged: “If numerous species . . . have really started into life at once, the fact would be fatal to the theory of evolution.” (The Origin of Species, New York, 1902, Part Two, p. 83) Does the evidence indicate that “numerous species” came into existence at the same time, or does it point to gradual development, as evolution holds?<br>  <br>  Have sufficient fossils been found to draw a sound conclusion?<br>  <br>  Smithsonian Institution scientist Porter Kier says: “There are a hundred million fossils, all catalogued and identified, in museums around the world.” (New Scientist, January 15, 1981, p. 129) A Guide to Earth History adds: “By the aid of fossils palaeontologists can now give us an excellent picture of the life of past ages.”—(New York, 1956), Richard Carrington, Mentor edition, p. 48.<br>  <br>  What does the fossil record actually show?<br>  <br>  The Bulletin of Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History pointed out: “Darwin’s theory of [evolution] has always been closely linked to evidence from fossils, and probably most people assume that fossils provide a very important part of the general argument that is made in favor of darwinian interpretations of the history of life. Unfortunately, this is not strictly true. . . . the geologic record did not then and still does not yield a finely graduated chain of slow and progressive evolution.”—January 1979, Vol. 50, No. 1, pp. 22, 23.<br>  <br>  A View of Life states: “Beginning at the base of the Cambrian period and extending for about 10 million years, all the major groups of skeletonized invertebrates made their first appearance in the most spectacular rise in diversity ever recorded on our planet.”—(California, 1981), Salvador E. Luria, Stephen Jay Gould, Sam Singer, p. 649.<br>  <br>  Paleontologist Alfred Romer wrote: “Below this [Cambrian period], there are vast thicknesses of sediments in which the progenitors of the Cambrian forms would be expected. But we do not find them; t|`|WX1b747Iaa	Assure me first that you will seriously consider evidence put before you. If I'm going to go to the effort, I want to see you burn a bible in front of me first, in earnest of your genuine desire to learn.<br>  <br>  Edit: Sorry for the hostility, so many ask questions about evolution who have already made their minds up and don't consider any evidence put before them. It gets tiresome.<br>  <br>  The Kiwi bird is a tiny ostrich, it evolved down from the size of regular ostriches in order to fill available life niches ordinarily taken by small mammals. The proof that it is an ostrich, that it shrank in size and that evolution is not a divinely driven perfecting force, lies in it's egg. The egg weighs one third of the bird's whole body mass, ridiculous for a bird that size. Kiwis responded to selective pressure to become smaller because the young were more able to get under shrubbery to forage for insects, lizards etc. There was no coordinating over-force that caused their egg to shrink along with body size. Here is an image of a Kiwi skeleton with egg, would a sensible creator design a bird this way?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.boneclones.com/images/sc-165_web-lg.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.boneclones.com/images/sc-165_...</a>|`|MeFeazFiaa	Absolutely.

You only have to look as the population grows and the differences in the human from now to when the black plague was around.  When the black death came around some people lived, some people never got it, and some people died.  Age, wealth, religion, and all the other factors in a normal human did not matter.  The black plague killed millions.<br>  <br>  But for the ones who survived, blood test were done on their great great grandchildren.  The doctors found that they had a gene which was passed on to their children and children's children which did not allow the black death to kill them or even get them sick the next time it come around.  This same gene protects people from getting the HIV and AIDS.<br>  <br>  If you believe in god, then this was his way of creating the prefect being to allow them to adapt to the new world that they face.  Evolution and the Bible are not exclusively different but rather they show how we were created to work with in the environment that we live in and the changes that it gives.  <br>  <br>  And who's to say that the Big Bang was not God thing.  Or he did not make the animal cell and plant cell from one base element.  And change animals slowly as he got a new idea.   For all we know, he might like to create something that changes.

What al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad said about them doing that after his death and not during his lifetime was also said by others and it is sound. No one should think that they did that during his lifetime. This indicates that it is permissible for women to cut their hair, and Allaah knows best. End quote. <br>  <br>  Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: We do not know of anything wrong with women cutting their hair. What is forbidden is shaving the head. You are not allowed to shave your head, but if you cut it to make it shorter or reduce its volume, we do not know of anything wrong with that. But that should be done in a good way that will be pleasing to you and your husband, and you can agree with him on something that will not be similar to the hairstyle of kaafir women because leaving it long will entail a lot of work to wash it and comb it. If the hair is thick and the woman cuts some of it to make it shorter and reduce its volume, there is nothing wrong with that. If she cuts some of it for purposes of beautification to make it pleasing to her and her husband, there is nothing wrong with that. But shaving it altogether is not permissible except in cases of sickness. And Allaah is the source of strength. End quote from Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah (2/515). <br>  <br>  Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him) said: <br>  <br>  It is not permissible for a woman to cut her hair at the back and leave the sides long, because this is ugly and messing with her hair which is part of her beauty, and it is also an imitation of kaafir women. The same applies to cutting it in different styles with the names of kaafir women or animals, such as the Diana cut, which is the name of a kaafir woman, or the lion cut or mouse cut, because it is haraam to imitate kaafir women or animals, and because this is messing with the woman’s hair which is part of her beauty.

Muslims believe they are saved by works.  God offers salvation as free gift of grace for those who believe in Jesus Christ.  One can not earn their way to heaven since it is a free gift offered to all.  But to have the gift you must receive it.

(Just thought you oughtta know!)<br>  <br>  Actually , Muslims and Jews believe in the same God, Allah. We believe he has no sons, partners, associates in His Kingdom and He was not crucified, manifested as a man, He was not a Holy Spirit (rather Gabriel is His Holy Spirit and Messenger).<br>  Muslims are more devout to him because they see Jesus as a sign of the Lord's Greatness.<br>  <br>  There is a chapter Maryam in the Quran, it's extremely short and well explained.

ThIS IS THE STORY OF MARYAM AND JESUS IN THE QURAN<br>  Relate in the Book (the story of) Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place in the East.She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent her our angel, and he appeared before her as a man in all respects.<br>  She said: "I seek refuge from you to ((Allah)) Most Gracious: (come not near) if you do fear Allah."He said: "Nay, I am only a messenger from the Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a holy son.She said: "How shall I have a son, seeing that no man has touched me, and I am not unchaste?"<br>  He said: "So (it will be): Your Lord has said 'that is easy for Me: and (We wish) to appoint him as a Sign unto men and a Mercy from Us':It is a matter (so) decreed<br>  <br>  So she conceived him, and she retired with him to a remote place.<br>  <br>  And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm-tree: She cried (in her anguish): "Ah! would that I had died before this! would that I had been a thing forgotten and out of sight!"<br>  <br>  But (a voice) cried to her from beneath the (palm-tree): "Grieve not! for your Lord has provided a bed beneath you;<br>  <br>  <br>  "And shake towards yourself the trunk of the palm-tree: It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon your.<br>  "So eat and drink and cool (your) eye. And if you do see any man, say, 'I have vowed a fast to ((Allah)) Most Gracious, and this day will I enter into not talk with any human being'"<br>  At length she brought the (child) to her people, carrying him (in her arms). They said: "O Mary! truly a strange thing you have brought!:<br>  "O sister of Aaron! Your father was not a man of evil, nor your mother a woman unchaste!But she pointed to the baby. They said: "How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?"<br>  He (Jesus) said: "I am indeed a servant of Allah. He has given me revelation and made me a prophet;<br>  "And He has made me blessed wheresoever I be, and has enjoined on me Prayer and Charity as long as I live;"(He) has made me kind to my mother, and not overbearing or miserable;<br>  "So peace is on me the day I was born, the day that I die, and the day that I shall be raised up to life (again)"! Such (was) Jesus the son of Mary: (it is) a statement of truth, about which they (vainly) dispute.It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son. Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter, He only says to it, "Be", and it is. <br>  (Jesus Said) Verily Allah is my Lord and your Lord: Thus, serve Him : this is a Way that is straight.<br>  But the sects differ among themselves: and woe to the unbelievers because of the (coming) Judgment of a Momentous Day.<br>  <br>  (((We are constantly being told in the Quran Allah/Yehweh is JUST.

These lost Attention Units must be chased down by tracking them from the place where they were lost. <br>  <br>  This was accomplished by a sophisticated technique of counselling called "Auditing." This involves asking people questions about painful incidents in their lives- which is where control over the lost Attention units was lost- until they can VISUALIZE the incident when the loss took place.

There is also examples where someone says one thing, but an engram was left because the child "mis heard" what was said.

Continuing:)<br>  <br>  An abstract spiritual entity called "the File Clerk" is spawned between the Auditor and the PreCLEAR, whose aid is invoked to bring the necessary next memory to the surface (Matt. 18:19-20).<br>  <br>  The state of FORGIVENESS facilitates the recovery of the 100 Attention Units (Matt. 18:21-35). The Auditor CANNOT become angry at, nor react to, any action or inaction of the PreCLEAR with a view to inflicting punishment, or the Auditing cannot work. the reverse is obviously the case.<br>  <br>  Without childlike humility on the part of both PreClear and Auditor implicitly following the master's instruction to the letter, it is impossible to even learn, much less apply the technique (Matt. 18:1-4). Jesus promises severe punishment for those who obstruct reception of this Knowledge (Matt. 18:6-7). It can be shown that Christianity has NOT ADVANCED since they REJECTED the DIANETICS Revelation in 1950. A person who achieves the state of CLEAR is on a par with Jesus himself (Matt. 18:5). SCIENTOLOGY was formed specially to help develop such people.<br>  <br>  It behooves the wise person to get rid of every hindrance to achieving CLEAR- even if it were part of their own body (Matt. 18:8-9). Such a person's Exteriorization (Remote Viewing, ESP,) can perceive The Face of God Himself in Heaven.<br>  <br>  THERE IS NO OTHER "SCIENCE RELIGION."<br>  <br>  Out of ignorance and envy, many people wish to disinform the public about Scientology, and focus on the actual faults of the organization during and after the time L. Ron Hubbard ran it. These involve people complaining of being defrauded of their money, and brutally treated- even to the point of actually literally dying. Some of these serious abusive incidents were proven to have actually happened- others were not. None of them are relevant to the value or not of Scientology.<br>  <br>  The one significant problem people have with SCIENTOLOGY is that they have no idea how to USE 100% of their Mind, should they gain access to it. There must be hundreds of things one could do with such awareness, but most of them seem to do none of them. The people who can afford to take the official Church of Scientology courses seem to usually be bored or busy with some narrow goal in mind, and have no intention of using their newfound ability to help the "Downstats" (losers) of the World- WHO NEED IT MOST.<br>  <br>  The Downstats of the First World are encouraged into crooked deals where they buy into expensive and unnecessary courses on credit, then are obliged to pay for these useless trainings with Slave Labour.<br>  If the least of them ever came to Africa to teach our poor what L. Ron Hubbard taught them about STUDY, EFFICIENCY, or COMMUNICATION, they would be National Heroes with the equivalent of The Key of The City everywhere they went, and earn money pay off their debts many times over inside of a year. BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY WENT INTO SCIENTOLOGY FOR.<br>  <br>  There should be Scientologist Laboratories churning out Scientific Breakthroughs by application of L. Ron Hubbard thought and rationality processes, as well as by Reverse-Engineering of their visions of Alien Technology Recalled from Reincarnation Visions- THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED YET. (It does not matter if the visions actually have happened or will- if a thing can be visualized- e.g. a working spaceship- THE VISION CAN BE BROKEN DOWN SPIRITUALLY to reveal its working principles. Many scientists have done this WITHOUT Scientology. Arthur C. Clarke INVENTED the concept of the Communications satellite in 1945, and to his lifelong regret failed to PATENT it. THEN, after Sputnik was launched, and he was told it was too late, invented the concept of Adult Satellite Cable TV. He failed to die counting his bank balance. These rich Scientologists are just lazy.)<br>  <br>  No need to be confused when you examine the facts for yourself.<br>  What's with these twerps STILL SAYING that THEY KNOW Scientology is FAKE BECAUSE they heard a RUMOUR that L. Ron Hubbard told Robert Heinlein in a bar (see GARY OSTER, Contributor #15, above) that the fastest way to make a million dollars was to start one's own religion, rather than to write novels for a penny a word.<br>  <br>  Did you ever refuse to read a Robert Heinlein book, or refuse to watch his movies (he wrote STARSHIP TROOPERS,) "BECAUSE he jst wanted to "make money?" "<br>  Do you refuse to fly in a jetliner because YOU HEARD that Boeing told Sikorsky in a bar that the fastest way to make a million dollars was to build fixed wing rather than rotary-wing aircraft?<br>  Do you refuse to buy Microsoft software because you HEARD that Bill Gates told Steve Jobs in a bar, that the quickest way to make a million dollars was to write buggy stolen software?<br>  <br>  Notice that the people who tell you these things to discourage you tell you NOTHING to enhance YOUR mind. They don't WANT your mind enhanced. They only want to you be scared and confused. <br>  <br>  The danger of mental enhancement is that it cannot be done piecemeal.

The major views on the afterlife derive from religion, esotericism and metaphysics. In many popular views, this continued existence often takes place in a spiritual or immaterial realm. Deceased persons are usually believed to go to a specific realm or plane of existence after death, typically determined by God, based on their actions during life. In contrast, the term reincarnation refers to an afterlife in which only the "essence" of the being is preserved, and the "afterlife" is another life on Earth.|`|PwD3slrTaa	Cross that bridge when you come to it, sport.

You flesh, your soul (mind, will, intellect, feelings), and your spirit man. Your spirit and soul are inseparable, as proven by Luke 16:22-31.

Abraham also had a voice, and told the rich man that Lazarus was comforted. Comforted from what, I wonder, if he can't remember what happened in his past life.

In fact, He says that it is so plain that we can even know His character and that man is without excuse.  Romans 1:18-20|`|2MfMyh4Maa	First comes belief and then acts of faith flow naturally from the belief.  Faith is the set of actions and the mindset that comes naturally from a belief.<br>  <br>  A belief is a decision of the intellect.  To believe is a choice.  Beliefs are underlying sets of assumptions of truth that we use everyday to make decisions, i.e. to live our lives.  We all have beliefs concerning God.  Some believe that God exists and that we ought to seek Him for our own happiness.  Others believe that rejecting God will lead to their best shot at happiness.|`|AA11056188	True believers have God's spirit living within them. They experience the very presence of God and therefore they are in a strong position to testify of His existence.

However I would like to point out that before the present obsession with the material world and the denial that anything that could not be touched, tasted, felt, heard, or seen could be real philosophers and many others believed that thoughts and ideas were more real than the physical world.  I understand that philosophers have five classical and distinct proofs for the existence of god.  Historically speaking the current scientific "enlightenment" is an aberration and arguably a Dark Age compared to both the theoretical and applied sciences of the late Bronze Age/early Iron Age cultures of Greece, Egypt, Persia, India and China.  So I would not trust science alone to answer everything.<br>  <br>  If however you intended the other meaning of faith, (ie to trust in someone's promises or ability to do what he says he will do) then it is perfectly possible to believe that there is a god but not to believe what he says or trust him.  To illustrate; we have all seen aeroplanes flying over head so we know that they can do it.  Many of us know something about the physics and engineering of how the wings create lift so we understand how it is possible.  We can see the statistics and understand that things go wrong only very rarely and that flying is much safer than many other activities we undertake every day without any worry or concern.  However to climb into an aircraft, sit down, buckle in and trust that you will get to your destination safely requires faith in the pilot and the engineering principles on which flight is based.  More faith than some people have.  Similarly I would contend that many people who claim to believe in a god and to be religious may have belief but their lives and actions clearly show that they do not have any meaningful faith in that deity.|`|dRXJro4kaa	i believe god with faith.the signs of his existence are very big:this world<br>  if he doesn't exist so who has created this world?for the first time?<br>  hasn't it happened to you to pray and want something impossible of god and it happens?<br>  it has happened to me. and i don't believe in God because of that he has accepted what I wanted, i believe in him because of that he is whom that is kinder than mother,and nearer than vein of the neck to me,he is with me when no one accompanies me.|`|STyZCsjDaa	"Now faith is the substance of all things hoped for, the evidence of thing not seen." Hebrews 11:1<br>  <br>  Well if we are talking about the Christian God which is the only God i believe to be true, then yes you have to have faith to truly believe in Him. The Bible itself said that without faith it is impossible to please God. You see God is not something tangible. Actually He is a spirit. He is a part of nature itself. Don't get me wrong I'm not a nature worshipper. I just believe that God is omnipresent. <br>  The first step to doing anything is to believe. In the same way the first step to getting to know God is to have faith in him then he will teach you his ways. Hope my answer helped.|`|wXaCGj7Saa	Yes. The word "faith" in the Hebrew and Greek does not mean "belief." It means what you live. So, if my faith is Christianity, that means that I'm living a Christian life, not that I believe in Jesus Christ, although, it does entail believing in Christ (as proven by Romans 10:9). But logically, my argument would be that everything you see around you has been created by someone or something. Nothing is on or in the earth that hasn't been created. I did not chop down a tree and set out the pieces of wood, and then come back a couple of years later, and it evolved to a table and chairs. So, I believe since everything we see is created (oh, and we're created in God's image, which means we as humans like to create things), the earth must have been created as well. That's logic, not faith. And faith isn't even technically a belief. My faith could be Buddhism, Hinduism, Muslim, Judaism, or any other number of religions. So there you have it.
