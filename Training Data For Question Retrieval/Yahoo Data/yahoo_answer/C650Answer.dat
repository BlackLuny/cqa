b0a56bfc16c93b5a7f847aef33f58bc6aa	well personally i dont think hes right to get mad since he seems to be keeping in contact with her too. i think YOU should tell him that if he expects you to follow his advice..that he should take his own as well. even if she tells him something without him starting conversation with her..he should keep it to himself because it seems to be adding more fuel to your anger.|`|sHMKQwk6aa	ignore the *****, I personally can't stand women like your friend, get rid of her she sounds like a right **** stirrer! This so called friend is causing you alot of problems and by the sound of it she isn't a good friend so delete her and don't have anything to do with her! Bet she hasn't got a boyfriend and I am not surprised, she's probably jealous of what you and your boyfriend have together! Ignore her babes and enjoy your relationship, she's just causing you problems.|`|W1GHZW3Caa	my girlfriend says the guy is always wrong<br>  if it concerns electronics money logic or intelligence the man is always right|`|dIqhwihGaa	Tell him your sorry you didn't think it was a big deal then take his advice and ask him to stop talking to her|`|MNDvP3rxaa	im kinda confused, your boyfriend is talking to a girl that is talking badly about you and telling you not to talk to her? it seems to me that he shouldnt be talking to her either, if she is saying bad things about you, then he needs to stand up for you and tell her to F off as well. i think he has a motive as of why he is telling you not to talk to her. he is being disrespectful to you by talking to her when she is talking crap about you. ditch them both.|`|NI2p945Eaa	Tell the betch to back off or you'll kick her ***. That's if you're a fighter,like me. Lol. Tell him it's not that you didn't want his advise and that you figured it shouldn't be too big of a deal, since you only thought she was saying happy birthday.|`|klcqgST9aa	I don't understand that you told him it bothers you that they talk, so his solution is that YOU and the girls stop talking, rather than he and the girls stop.<br>  <br>  I'm worried he was mad you talked to her because he's hiding something with her. He's got it so you'll never talk to her, and then you'll never know what they talk about. I don't mean to make things more complicated, but that's how it looks from a stranger.<br>  <br>  <br>  He's over reacting. I bet if you told him you wanted to start talking to her, he'd flip out, but he's your boyfriend, not your master, and it's not up to him who you talk to.
NvgowkZzaa	Be sweet, and say what your feeling. Like if she is being cute or funny say something like "oh your so cute!" or "I wish you were here with me right now." or "I can't wait to see you." Try complimenting her, and letting her know that you like her, and also that you can't wait to see her and be with her. But do not over do it! If you go on and on about something then a girl feels annoyed and feels weird when you keep going on and on about something. If you keep saying over and over and over in one night how pretty a girl is, it annoys her, it's not sincere anymore. If you say it once in the beginning and maybe once at the end of texting for a long time or talking, then it's flattering. NOT ALL THE TIME!!|`|QL12LD5daa	HOW BOUT THESE:<br>  <br>  "I want to taste something sweet, can i taste your lips?"<br>  <br>  &&<br>  <br>  "I lost my teddy bear, can I sleep with you?"<br>  <br>  &&<br>  <br>  "Lets flip a coin, Tails im yours, Heads your mine"<br>  <br>  &&<br>  <br>  "I have a bad mouth, but I can do great things with it"<br>  <br>  &&<br>  <br>  "If you were my homework I'd do you all night"<br>  <br>  &&<br>  <br>  "They say milk does the body good, but damn how much do you drink"<br>  <br>  &&<br>  <br>  "I got a mouth full of skittles, wanna taste the rainbow"<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!<br>  <br>  iT TOOK ME A LONG TiME!<br>  <br>  <33<br>  <br>  :D|`|EfD3UBLdaa	I know everyones saying be yourself but truly be yourself, girls love guys, well atleast i do, who are open and honest.

Make her feel good about herself. Tell her you cant wait to see her again. Just dont say nothing thats stupid. And especially don't say nothing perverted if you want something serious with her.

It might be that she likes you that way. Using other peoples words weakens you stand in this relationship because you not expressing you.

I mean if that's how you are then fine, but it seems like you're reaching.

HFHNxQ0vaa	i didn't divorce my husband over this. he was doing the same thing. i believe men do this to live out some fantasy. some of them are bored with the same ole stuff and want fun without physically cheating. not saying its ok cause it bothered the hell out of me too.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Print the texts if you can.  You can photograph the phone and print it if you have a digital camera.  If he has already deleted, you won't have the evidence, so try to wait for some more...<br>  <br>  I wouldn't discuss this with him at all.  <br>  <br>  He is a cheater and he is blaming you.  Classic.<br>  <br>  Added:  That is NOT a "wake-up call to work on your marriage."  That is pathetically blaming you for his failure to abide by his vow to "forsake all others."|`|iOqmoIrcaa	First, this is not necessarily a reason to divorce.  It's just a wake up call to work on the marriage.  Secondly, did he ever try telling you he wasn't getting what he needed?  If he didn't, then he is just as much to blame.  If he did, then it is your fault.  But he should have divorced you before he started the whole flirting with other women thing.|`|1HTRWrawaa	There is NO EXCUSE for a married person to flirt with other people or cheat on their spouse. PERIOD!!! If there is a problem in the marriage, then the two of you need to sit down and talk about it. It's up to the BOTH of you to work together to solve your problems and save your marriage. If the two of you can't or won't do that and one of you has the desire to be with someone else, because you aren't getting what you want or need from your spouse, then that person needs to file for a divorce BEFORE they get involved with someone else. <br>  <br>  Cheating is for selfish people who want their cake and eat it too and they are flat out cowards who can't or won't do what is right for everyone involved.<br>  <br>  Tell your husband who wants to blame YOU for what he is doing, that if YOU were getting what you needed in this marriage, you wouldn't have to spy on him to find out that he is a liar and a cheater.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	First, Im not a women, sorry but I have personally dealt with many couples seeking divorce because the wifeis accusing the husbnd of exactly what youre saying so i have some experience in this area. Computers or should say websites on computers themselves have caused many a divorce over the past few years. the biggest problem being that the computers are so readily available in homes, work, school, etc and so easy to use. Many wives and a few husbands have confronted their spouses over porn and answering personel ads on here and the spouse says the usual theyll stop which they do at home but go elsewhre to get online til they get so obsessed that they sneak back at home for probably a quick fix and get caught again and this time two problems are happening; 1 on line again and 2. lying about stopping, so then they have had enough and they contact me about divorce. Some wives even give their husbands multi chances before approaching me. It becomes an addiction to their spouses with no way out. So by no means are you alone here in this. Youre not to blame here as men will be men, and no one blames you for being tired of it. Sorry about your marriage and good luck.  If there is anymore I could possibly help you with my email address is   thunder_wright@yahoo.com   and please feel free to email me|`|fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	Oh, how typical for cheaters - blame the other person for what they are doing. Why didn't he ask for what he needs? So many marriages break up because one person assumes that the other person is supposed to guess what their spouse needs. <br>  <br>  But what is your question? Whether or not to divorce him? It is up to you. Do you need him? If yes, give him the bashing and keep him, if no - divorce him whenever it is convenient for you.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	by state laws..this would not be a valid reason for divorce..texting another woman..apparently he has issues..needs to work on them..and you yourself should consider counseling with your husband to see if you two can work things out first..|`|IE1LvgD9aa	He is an idiot! Classic. He wasn't ready for marriage. So he blames you. Wake up and smell the coffee. He needs to take responsibility for his actions.|`|2ce87ef838b3c546c942a9b12750c8abaa	Whats your question?
WKBK4BI8aa	You don't want to hurt them but sometimes you just have to and suck up the pain you know you're going to feel when you tell them you are not interested in them at all. It's the weirdest feeling ever. You get confused because you don't know if you're in love with them, and sometimes they are someone you already care for because they are your friend. This has happened to me twice, and two more times partially. But they weren't "in love" with me.|`|KsNSvp1Maa	You feel sorta guilty, but you have to tell them because it could really hurt them to lie to them.|`|hKax9Jl6aa	It kind of hurts because you don't want to hurt that persons feelings with the truth.
Ldh0k6DPaa	if ur honestly only interested in friendship then i dont see the harm in sending him a "happy birthday, hope you have a good day" kind of txt. it will let him know ur still being friendly but dont go any further than that. but if its more your after then dont bother, like the girl above said, dont cause trouble cos it will just make it harder for friendship to happen<br>  <br>  :)|`|u5HmOfhRaa	i def. agree with Harle|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Leave him alone, he has a gf, why stir up trouble?|`|ZAN6feeMaa	Yes, like the first person suggested, "leave him alone." There is no reason to wish him a happy birthday. It will gain you nothing. You are somewhat obsessed and many people go through the same blizzard of emotions. You will come across another young man one day and will laugh at yourself for being a fool.
AjBpAPpdaa	Be romantic, cook a meal, and typically scatter roses to the bedroom, kiss him, you shouldn;t be afraid to do stuff like that after all you're married
Z0lbrnHpaa	just start a conversation with him. ask him what's his favorite color...what's his favorite movie...what does he like to do for fun...etc
XsgP1O7gaa	Talk to your parents about this, and ask them why they feel like this! Tell them that you and your partner are getting married, and that you would respect it if they treated her as a part of the family. It's only fair. Tell them they should respect your feelings. If it doesn't work, then go visit her, and tell them that you do not have the same assurance in them as before because of them being ridiculous and plain mean.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this works :)|`|68etazoGaa	Tell your parents that it's official, you two are getting married, you love him/ her and they need to accept that. They can kick you out, but they'll ask you to move back in in like a week because they'll miss you too much. They can't ground you. If you're old enough to get married, then you're legally not under their control anymore. But, you can understand this, their baby is growing up.|`|iMaYLGECaa	my brother got engaged last year (he only got engaged because his fiancee was jealous of all his girl friends and he had to prove he was only with her) they broke up eventually (thank god...sorry but i hated her) but my dad didnt want her in the house for good reason (she spent the whole day in her pyjamas, stealing my things and eating practically all our food) but my brother gave up trying to convince him she was fine and he started to visit her instead...|`|SouPhkgxaa	go visit her instead of her visiting you.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	answer<br>    move out,or marry her.. your are more likly to old to be living at home anyway if you are engaged|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	Why do they dislike your fiance? Talk to your father about this and ask him what his issue is. Maybe it's something that can be fixed or solved with a simple apology or acknowledgment. But in the end, if things still do not work, then sorry, she can't come over anymore. It's his house. How would you feel if someone kept bringing someone to your house that you disliked? Try to resolve this calmly. If nothing works, then just don't invite her over. Go to her house, go outside and do things, or maybe make a deal with your folks. Ask if she can stay for just a few hours or so. Hopefully they will compromise in a way that leaves everyone happy. Good Luck with this xoxo
tVqLmImUaa	What's the rush? I think it's very sensible.<br>  <br>  The majority of couples spend their entire engagement completely consumed with planning and discussing the wedding. They don't even give themselves any time just to enjoy being engaged! <br>  <br>  They can be blinded to any problems that may be hiding underneath all the wedding talk. Seen it happen a lot!|`|qeRSaWWiaa	I think its good to wait the longer the better.

xBd96wvRaa	Bring a pencil and pad with you when you visit her so she knows you are sincere when you ask what you can do to help.<br>  <br>  Allow her to delegate some of the tasking this tragedy has generated. <br>  Be prepared to write down what she asks you to do.<br>  Be prepared to offer up suggestions on what you can do - in case she is shy asking. <br>  <br>  Contact her other frineds and coordinate taking turns bringing her and her family dinner for a couple weeks. Casseroles, stew, etc. <br>  <br>  Smuggle some food into the hospital for all of them when you visit. Hospital food is so bad even a bag of burgers will seem very appealing. Even a Jamba Juice would be appreciated.|`|kdmhuVTEaa	Be there for her|`|eF92uM2Saa	This is a financially devastating situation.<br>  <br>  Has the red cross stepped in at all?  Does she or did any members of her family belong to a religious group?  What other social service organizations can you think of that might be able to offer assistance?<br>  <br>  Find out if any organizations or groups have come forward to help and if so what they are willing to do for her.  If they haven't, ask her what kind of help she needs and see if you can arrange to find it for her.  <br>  <br>  If nothing else, maybe you can figure out a way to do a fund raiser with the help of the community.|`|CNz9MF4naa	tell her she can sleep over whenever she wants (clarify with your parents), and explain to her that just because her mother's grieving TERRIBLY to the point of dying, that she doesn't have to. Tell her you're there if she wants to talk, excuse her mood swings, and do anything else to comfort her. Mainly the first two things should be better.|`|1YrrkwWLaa	Aww...that's so sad...maybe u can do something 2 cheer her up like have a sleepover or something that will make her forget about her father! but here is a good idea of all...pray 4 her family!! that will work!|`|J2G6ebThaa	help her with everything she needs to be done like help her contact family and friends for the funeral and do anything she asks or needs. this is a rough time for her so help her through it|`|X9Xt16dbaa	Be there for her all the time that you can be with her. comfort her, show her love and care.<br>  <br>  Take her mind off of it. don't mention his death. take her to town fairs, amusement parks, bike rides, etc.<br>  <br>  Maybe they should get a dog or some type of pet that they can love and train and bring for walks or to the park. That way when you cant be there for her she will have her dog to keep her busy.
Z0lbrnHpaa	well there's not much you could do...he or she had to deal with that guilt and the chance of possibly getting caught.
kAA0N5RCaa	Well. Hun, He seems to be scared of his feelings. The best thing to do is take small steps and gradually tell him how you feel and maybe he will in turn, tell you. And as for your suspiciousness, Yes. But your friend should not of went and asked him that. It was rude.|`|OW16Nkrgaa	be careful, because while it would be a good sign if he turned red & was very embarrassed , sometimes friends will tell you that when they're somewhat unsure and make it sound like its better than it is, just out of habit for helping their friends, not with any bad intentions. don't make a move or anything yet, because if he said no it might really be no =[
0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	We probably only spent around $2,500 total for our wedding day. That includes absolutely everything we had from my dress to renting his tux to purchasing clothes and accessories for our wedding party (no one had to buy their own attire). The location was only seventy five dollars for nine in the morning until seven in the evening, we had the ceremony outdoors on a beautifully kept lawn between two trees under an archway (used in a friends wedding so was free), we set up chair on the lawn. We had the reception in the commons house on the property; it was a potluck style where we provided a main course, beverages and cake and guests brought their favorite side dishes. My very talented sister made our cake and I made the groom's cake. I did all the setting up the day of and put together all the bouquets and centerpieces myself from silk flowers and ribbon. We had mini bubbles that I personalized with a sticker of our last initial. As for attire and accessories; I wore a sapphire blue gown that was actually a bridesmaid's dress so therefore much less expensive than a bridal gown, we rented his tux, I got the flower girl/ring bearer/usher clothes at Gymboree on sale, my mom made the bridesmaid's dresses, groom's men wore khakis and white shirts with ties we got. If you want you can view my pictures here: <a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewPicture&friendID=53188044&albumId=2519061" rel="nofollow">http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...</a>|`|ACTa6N5Naa	Well my wedding was the best day of my life and too be honest I have never worked out exactly how much we spent but I would think it was in the region of ￡9000 easy! Me and hubby had to save lots but the best way was for us anyway was to set a date and stick to it and basically save every penny we had, we also did overtime at work and literally never had a social life (that was our own choice).  We did cut corners too by doing a lot of things ourself and did lots of research for the cheapest options.  Also alot of depends how big you want your wedding to be.  Are wedding went from only immediate family of about 12 people up to 200!! SO my advice to you is be certain about what you want and stick to it has much as you can! I found setting a budget doesn't work because you never can factor everything in cause you forget about all the wee things that cost extra etc.   But ill tell you something although me and my hubby are still paying for our wedding 8 months later it was the best day of my life and would not change it!  To be honest the money at end of the day was the last thing on my mind on the day and afterwards its the memories that count!! Hope you get the wedding you want!
LKsl00CTaa	Oh god yes, eye contact is crucial. Not just normal eye contact, flirty smiles along with it. Also, we DO notice the nicer looking girls first, but after that we start liking personality.

I'm currently dating a guy four years older than me, it would be like the freshmen senior relationship, but i'm a junior now and he's off in college.  just be careful because an older guy will probably expect more from you so be sure that you are ready before you take the step and getting into a physical relationship. freshmen year is really too young to start getting into that sort of relationship especially with an older guy.|`|IGQw4267aa	lmao.<br>  yeah. <br>  don't plan on it working out. seriously.<br>  <br>  mine por favor?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlygtJNO_oSzP7P8aG0DuE3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222102706AAXFucX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|aXqi9lYJaa	Um, not IN highscool. but once the freshman graduates maybe...but having the senior graduate and go to college....trust me they'll cheat on you no matter how much they say they'll never do that|`|1Kxxwjjdaa	which one r u?<br>   if u r the SR thwn sure if u wanna. <br>  <br>  But if u r the freshman than it would be awkward for the girl/guy.

loqsl5xXaa	it sounds like she is depressed and going through those awkward moments in life with her body and self image. <br>  <br>  It is natural and normal. It seems like she just needs a little space and at the same time reminders of how beautiful she is. Are you the older sister? Maybe help her feel better about herself. let her know how smart she is, kind to others, helpful and a genuine person. Help her feel good about who she is 1st. While doing that be the big sister and show her some tips on makeup, tips on hair, good perfumes/body lotions. Maybe have a mini spa day at your house (nails, facial, hair pedis) all that. Talk to her with general conversations about school who she is into and about her friends, teachers.. If there is someone she likes maybe give her tips on how to talk to them and all that. Go with her to the mall. <br>  <br>  About the home stuff. Ask her to do it with you and make it kind of fun, talk while you do. Ask her why she is giving your parents such a hard time (make all the conversation non judgmental when you ask and make your tone non abrasive). Tell her she is hurting everyones feeling on how she is acting towards others. maybe talk your parents into having a small sleep over with your friends and hers and do that whole slumber party deal. <br>  <br>  she will grow out of this phase, it's going to be hard for everyone, but esp. for her. just give her time and talk to her about anything and everything. getting her to open up to you is really important and getting her to believe she isn't ugly is also important. <br>  <br>  if she doesn't get out of it say in like 6 months or so then maybe she should talk to someone outside of the family..<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Xcs1USwvaa	Well one thing i can say is i dont have a sister.  What i would do is give her compliments evey so often or build her selfesteem up.  My brother is like that.  Just be nice all love her.  Give her things she wants and she will come around.  hope that helps!|`|tnMFvSyPaa	Slap her spoiled *** around a bit.|`|xBOSZPZTaa	Thinking that she's fat is not healthy but not unusual. With all the pressure from celebrities and other peers  to be stick thin it has become common for young girls to believeve that they are too fat. Watch what she eats because if she begins to starve herself or go on a diet it can be very unhealthy. If she insists on going on a diet give her healthier foods than what she is eating. It wont hurt her to give up a little junk food but make sure she takes in enough calories for someone her age. You are going to have to help her get through this stage. It will go away soon. Here is the URL for a website to help you and her find out how many calories it is the healthiest for her to take in:  <a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PED/content/PED_6_1x_Calorie_Calculator.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PED/conten...</a><br>  . Just explain to her that  being healthy is better than being anorexic or bolemic.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>              As for the anger thats natural too. She's at the age when her idea of happy means that she gets whatever she wants. Don't give it to her. She'll act like she hates you but she will get over it. Talk to her about her day. Don't pry too much. As you are her sister she will be more likely to open up to you rather than your parents. I find that the best way to get compliance out  of teenagers is ground them from something for 3 to 7 days depending on what she has done or didn't do. Let your parents do the grounding. Just be her friend when she wants one. Make sure that she doesn't decide that she needs to do drugs to make herself feel happier. If you do find out that she's doing drugs ask her to stop and then go tell your parents if she doesn't stop. Do not make any deals with her. No "stopping tomorrow" if she complies with you take the drugs that she has. After that search her room with her permission (if possible to get it) or ask your parents to look for them if you are without her permission. I am not suggesting that she is doing drugs. Don't get worked up over it. If you notice anything that leads you to believe she's doing drugs just confirm your suspicion and take care of it.  Just try to take care of her.<br>  <br>  Here is a site that you can give her if she doesn't  want to talk to you: <a href="http://www.beinggirl.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.beinggirl.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|SouPhkgxaa	try talking to her.

I'll be your friend, thats if you want an online friend...<br>  <br>  May be you should try putting your self out there more.|`|jkv6STv5aa	I am so sorry, but try to make friends with the people around you, older people offer wisdom. You could also try to join a club or group outside your school. If all else fails change schools, but I would  just make older friends.|`|jh1zY9yHaa	A community college right? It's one of my options after I graduate from college, but there won't be anyone around to meet that's my age. I'm kind of expecting that to happen to me too. <br>  <br>  Hang on there, OK? (=  Most of them must have gone to big universities. When I was little, I noticed that most of the 18-22 year olds were gone.<br>  <br>  Luckily, I'm religious, and I joined a local youth group full of people in that age span. Maybe the fitness-center, club, or where young people are working are the best places for you to go to.<br>  <br>  I've spoken to one of the youth group's member, and he said it was lonely during college, and his chance to make friends came when a youth group was open.
JXMjscVmaa	As I'm around the same size as your 2 bridesmaids I would recommend taking look at something like this  <a href="http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplayView?storeId=10052&catalogId=10051&categoryId=-49998974¤tIdx=20&subCategory=-49998976%7c-49998975%7c-49998974&catentryId=1000089#reviews" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/s...</a> Yes it has thin straps but it also has a wrap and the way it falls past the waist will look good on all shapes some of the other dresses people have given you like this <a href="http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplayView?storeId=10052&catalogId=10051&categoryId=-49998973&colorName=Truffle&subCategory=-49998976|-49998975|-49998973&top_category=&catentryId=1000375" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/s...</a> ruched waist or a sash under the bust make the  waist more noticeable the other option is to same colour same store/desinger same leanth but other then that get the dress they look good in!|`|mx3gFmIKaa	As a heavyset person myself I have some suggestions.  Pick a long dress.  Do not pick a dress with alot of skin showing.  Showing legs wouldn't be flattering for most heavy girls.  Heavier girls are usually bustier.  Don't pick a strapless dress.  A halter is very flattering.  You can also pick s shrug, or wrap for the bigger girls to feel more comfortable.  Also pick a darker color.  I will be the MOH in my sister's wedding, the other bridesmaid suggested champagne color.  Yikes, and she's not small to boot size 14 and over 30, I am close to 40.  Suggest chocolate, or navy, something dark.  Halter, empire waist with shrug, with no open back, long dress.  Allow the girls to wear their hair down or only semi-up to have that security.<br>  I agree with mydarlyn that those dresses would be flattering|`|YsiJiOqXaa	YES! Same problem myself. I have size, 18, 2,10, 12 and 14 This dress looks good on everyone!<br>  <a href="http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplayView?storeId=10052&catalogId=10051&catentryId=1000258" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/s...</a>|`|ckJP6TTQaa	Have them wear different styles! It's actually becoming much less common for bridesmaids to all wear the same dress. Pick a color and a bridesmaid dress designer that offers many styles in that color (think David's Bridal or Alfred Angelo). Then tell your girls to find something that works for them.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, if you like a more structured look, have the two bridesmaids wear the same dress that looks good on them and have the MOH wear a different style. Since your bridesmaids are similar sizes, this should solve the size issue. It is very common for the MOH to be wearing something distinctive.|`|Zkw40Rrgaa	The most elegant wedding I ever went to was one in NYC where the girls each bought a black dress to suit their individual body types. They were acknowledged as being part of the bridal party by the flowers they wore. I guess the bride decided on the length and they selected they gowns together or something. The color was so chic and each girl no matter what her size looked stunning because they got just the right dress. Plus the bride really stood out and was even more special being the only one in white or for that matter in a light color.|`|h3NJO9dWaa	Davids bridal has the perfect dresses. They have collections where you can mix and match seperates so that each bridesmaid can pick something she feels comfortable in. They have a variety of wraps and shawls to cover bare arms, top suggestions for chesty ladies, long skirts if you don't want to show legs, it's pretty great. I have this problem with my bridesmaids too.|`|WzAHKILcaa	I was in a similar wedding- bride's sisters size 4 and 6, groom's sisters size 14 and 16, maid of honour size 18.

You keep letting her do what she's doing you are going to keep having problems.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|bDQYtMHfaa	Sounds like the Ex needs to be a little more responsible. However , it is his job to tell her " You know what, I have plans can u keep the children for now." She can only do what you allow her to. Not taking the kids for a night won't make him a bad parent. She has a social life how come you guys can't have one. If she is single & trying to put the guilt trip on him, don't let her. Be firm & fair. Talk to your BF about this & let him know how you feel|`|kYXVb8AZaa	I would definitely have to have a heart to heart with him. Make it extremely clear that You aren't trying to come between his children (step or otherwise) and himself, but that there has to be more structure here. Life is too chaotic without it. If he can't or wont do anything about it, even if it is through a mediator then you are going to have to make a tough decision. That being, are you willing to go with your relationship the way that it is or move on. You can't make someone change, but you can hope that they will understand your concerns and care for you enough that they will at least make an attempt at a compromise.<br>    The ball is really in your court if he refuses to play it, then you have to.

I have heard of creepier things happening from men and women who stalk their former lovers current significant others online, offline, at work and crap like that with intent to cause physical and emotional harm.

meuHrhhAaa	I don't want to scare you, but this is really bad.<br>  <br>  I completely lost my best friend to something almost exactly like this situation. Unfortunately at the time, I was too young and naive to see what was going on right in front of my eyes, and by the time I tried to save her, it was already much too late. Everyday I wish I could go back and tried harder, but wishing only left numerous nights of crying myself to sleep.<br>  <br>  DON"T LET HER SLIP AWAY FROM YOU.<br>  <br>  There is no way that guy is off drugs if someone in is family is doing it.<br>  You can NEVER trust a dug addict. I've learned this the hard way.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, DO NOT just stand by and let it happen, or assume that she'll come to her senses and get out of it by herself. It WILL NOT happen. <br>  <br>  Also, in relationships, these kind of guys tend to be abusive.<br>  He could also get her involved in a whole world of crap that most people never get out of.<br>  <br>  She will get hurt if this goes on, she'll grow farther and farther away from you everyday if you don't do something.<br>  <br>  I'm serious, I'd hate to see someone else lose friend to something like this.<br>  <br>  Do everything you possibly can to help her.<br>  If she has good parents (which would be a great advantage, since my friend's parents didn't care about her at all), let them know if she get involved in any drugs or anything. I know she may get mad at you for the moment, but she'll eventually come to forgive you and realize you were only looking out for her, and it could probably save her life.<br>  <br>  I am not over exaggerating, the situation may seem small now, but it will get very worse.<br>  <br>  Constantly tell her how much she means to you, and remind her of all the good times you guys had together, and let her know as an honest friend what you think about 'Joe', and tell her all your true feelings. If she doesn't believe you, find someway to subtly prove it to her (so she won't get mad at you and shut you out).<br>  <br>  Tell her that you need her there for you, and if she cares enough about her family and friends, she'll trust you.<br>  <br>  But like I said, do everything you absolutely need to make sure she doesn't slip away from you. Be very careful.<br>  <br>  I sincerely hope everything turns out well.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I'm not sure if it'll help, but either your or your friend should read this book called 'Go Ask Alice', which is an incredible moving book. It's the actual diary of a normal teenage girl, who slowly gets involved into all the wrong things, and it leads to her eventual death. It's a great book, you should read it. It helps a lot to understand the process and impact of these things.|`|gLqX7TG0aa	let her find out for herself...a part of growing up

2KUdefSBaa	Love is what you and the other party make it. <br>  <br>  I give more than I get but that is ok as I am not in for profit and we are happy. <br>  <br>  The failure in love is because people focus on emotion and sex and not on the relationship itself.<br>  <br>  Its a powerful emotion that is a byproduct of a special relationship.  <br>  Focusing on the relationship is the key. Always work on building a solid foundation and go from there. Planning is very important.  Do you both want children? Do you plan to stay home? Are you in it for the long or short term? All good things involve hard work, sacrifice and perseverence.  A loving relationship is no exception.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	I have been married twice, I love both of them with all my heart, It really killed my inside, of course each one was different but the end result is Iam not married anymore, any relationship is only good if you both put 110 percent into, have to honest, open, willing to talk about anything even if it might hurt your feelings, once you let one of those slip away, you might as well say goodbye, Love can be great, you can really feel it when its good but when its bad you feel that to just hope that its not to late to make things better, but if it is take what you have lost and learn from that, and make things better the next time around. your heart will survive just takes time, but you will move on.|`|R8HWkcoMaa	Love is just like all those rock ballads!!<br>  <br>  "These cuts bleed deep but you plead innocence, are you hell or are you heaven sent, You're much to cold to know how much you meant to me"<br>  <br>  "Shoulda seen it comin when the roses died, shoulda seen the end of summer in your eyes, shoulda listened when you said good night when you really meant goodbye"<br>  <br>  "Love bites, love bleeds"<br>  <br>  But to me now its still like all those bon jovi songs .  I always knew that there was someone out there to love me like Jon BonJovi sings about!! And I've been with him for the past 9yrs.<br>  <br>  We have hard times, we have a few disagreements but in all we are still loved up more than ever.<br>  <br>  "I'd live & I'd die for you"<br>  <br>  Soppy & sad but true!!|`|2n0vR0OMaa	Love... what would I know. I have been with my hub for 20 years. Sometimes its drudge, sometimes it's romance, and yes, I still love him- sometimes I want to strangle him!  Watching your children sleep, laughing together. comfortable in each others company.<br>  To me love, past the hormone happy dating days, is caring for another person beyond "what will I get out of it?" and genuinely supporting each other in all the crap life likes to throw at us along the way.|`|crbzVL0Haa	I think people get the wrong idea about love. They expect their love with a significant other to be different than other love, when really, it's the same, only expressed differently. <br>  <br>  There's so much love in my life, I hardly no what to do with myself. <br>  <br>  The real problem, I think, is that people don't appreciate the love that they have.|`|rtOYamgSaa	Love is different for every person ... everyone expects something else (well, most of the time) - you never really get what you're expecting, maybe that's the good, and wonderful thing about love, it's always a surprise... on the other hand, you sometimes get disappointment, but in most cases it's a 50-50 chance... never lose hope... or like the saying goes  hope dies last, but still... it dies"|`|8c9Q23Wiaa	I didn't really know what to expect about it until I I felt it. And for me, even though my love isn't reciprocated, I still feel really happy to just love everyone around me. I just feel happy when they are, especially him, it makes me feel great, even if it seems like their happiness means I'm not part of it. I want to live my life for them. And I'm hoping that maybe someday, someone would want to live their life for me, too. ^_^|`|kYXVb8AZaa	Absolutely nothing like what I thought that it would be. I have been in a few relationships. The one that felt the closest to my idea of 'love' was with a man that was a friend of my brothers, he wanted to live in the bars and eventually landed in prison. Although I felt closer to him that I had any other man, he just wouldn't settle down and wasn't ready to. maybe never will be. Now I am in a relationship with a man that I love and care for and who stays home and not in the bars and who is not a constant par tier, and I like that, but the feelings aren't there that were there before.. So, I don't know what love should be or is like anymore, but I think happiness in love in way overrated and I am good with contentment|`|aeLyiRczaa	People do not understand love for the most part.  Love is not so much a feeling or an emotion as it is really the way you act.  For instance, love is kind, love is not self seeking, love keeps no record of wrongs done to it.  Now, are those feelings or emotions?  True love is treating the other person as you should, even when you are not in the mood or dont feel like it.  It is doing what you should when you hate to do so.  True love is expressed as much as felt.|`|AA11868913	love was something i never thought about when i was younger. and then when it finally hit me (and it hit me hard), it became clear to me that it's so much more than anyone has ever described it. i believe this is because it does emotions no justice when we try to describe them - it's like explaining a kaleidoscope to a blind man.|`|lKn7nZfBaa	I fell in love at 15. <br>  <br>  I got married (to someone else) at 23<br>  I had 2 serious relationships in between.<br>  <br>  I live with the love of my life<br>  (we met when I was 15)<br>  <br>  We just get each other, love each other, and the same things in life.|`|4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	No...the deeper the love, the harder/nastier the break up.  That's just my opinion before others attack my answer.  I am on Yahoo! Answers right?  That's my answer.  Perhaps one day it will change but for now that's what I think.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|bMk6xZaSaa	There's one problem about love for you...you are "imagining" what it is going to be like and expecting reality to follow suit.  Let me break it to you sweetheart, love is everything you dreamed it would be in the weirdest ways you will ever imagine.  My boyfriend and I were best friends before we were going out, and the "romance" and all that other stuff you would imagine the perfect relationship to have...isn't happening.  You know what?  I'm happier in this relationship than any other I've ever been in.  So stop imagining the future and just live in the moment.  Be aware of what could come, but don't let it rule over what is.  <br>  As for the different definitions of love, I think that everyone agrees (at least those who are married and have stayed married) is that love is the choice to do whatever is best for the on you love.  There is only failure in love when you choose to do what you want for yourself and not them.  That definition is too abstract for me though.  Here is something concrete.  My aunt and uncle were a wonderful couple, and they were picture perfect.  They were engaged to be married when a horrible accident happened to my aunt.  She is paralyzed from mid-back down.  She cannot move her fingers right, so that means she can't grip things.  He married her in spite of the fact that every morning he would have to help her put her bra ON and that going to a baseball game for their 4 year old kid, was a big deal because she can barely get in her car.  He believes that he is the happiest man he's ever met.  She gives him so much joy that he would "marry her again and again and again if [he] had to".  Those were his words not mine.<br>  <br>  So, my advice is simply the advice of someone who has lived and experienced life for 25 years...and seeing other people who are really in love has given me hope, but that only comes with living in today (not tomorrow) and doing what is the very best for the person that you are in love with. :)|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	It is MORE than you have dreamed up, if it is with the right person.

Not to mention heart break that comes from death of a dying relationship.<br>   I agree that everyone has different expectations so some people are let down, but i think it also can bring two people together. Or you know there is always working things out, which some people can do and some cant. any way you look at it you are right.<br>   I also think i am very loving and a negotiator, so i always want to work problems brought to my attention out. My vices are Ive been burned and so i find it much harder to completely give myself, I feel the need to defend  myself when i really dont need to and it causes problems.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I totally agree with you. We are all individuals and though we may love each other equally deep down; sometimes we show it in different ways that the other person doesn't understand or takes the wrong way. Yes, it causes conflict for sure.|`|n8lXItGraa	I agree.  Not too often are two people on the same page as far as their expectations of love are.  For the most part, I have noticed that many couples aren't even on the same planet!|`|sNr9Od89aa	love was exactly what i expected it to be. until it ended.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	As everyone is different, so there their conceptions on anything including love and everyone has two ideas of it; fantasy, what they think it should be and reality, what it really is. Neither never match so one learns to adapt from their fantasy definition to the reality one and hopefor the best. Now if one cant  or expects the reality love to be too much like their fantasy vision and cant adapt, then divorces happen. Most divorcing couples have way too high expectations of what love and marriage should be like so they get really discouraged too quickly like within the first 2 years. maybe society and TV are to blame, filling young couples heads with fantasy notions of reality marriages being like TV marriages, and living happily ever after. But we all know reality is no near TV fantasies and bad things to happen to good people.|`|8p31dENPaa	I really wasn't sure about love, but it really is all it's cracked up to be. It's this wonderful, amazing, and rewarding and the best feeling in the world, but it's also scary, vulnerable, trying and difficult sometimes. It's an unconditional love, a partnership, a team. It's not his and hers, it's ours. It's our problems, it's our celebrations and tears and worries. I feel in love for the first time at 25. I never understood the big deal about falling in love, until I fell in love with him.|`|IE1LvgD9aa	Love is patient,love is kind.It does not envy,it does not boast,it is not proud.It is not rude,it is not self-seeking,it is not easily angered,it keeps no record of wrongs.Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.It always protects,always trusts,always hopes,always perseveres.<br>   Love never fails.<br>  Love is not taken. It is given away.|`|5lXouSKAaa	I don't think love is perfect. Of course we have expectations for the "perfect guy" or "perfect girl", but that's impossible. Love is working it out with your companion and accepting both flaws and the great things about that person.|`|AA11367901	It seems the ones I loved in romance never returned it the same. <br>  If I can just get in a romance and feel comfortable I'm blessed. <br>  <br>  A good family will always return love but it's not the same kind of love.|`|AA11324847	It was better than I thought it would be.

kfWi9ZkEaa	With some people there can be a number of reasons:<br>  <br>  they heard from Joey that Tony said that you and Jemmie, who's going out with Bruce, were seen possibly in the dark behind Denny's three and a half weeks ago and aren't you slime?<br>  <br>  you can't defend against that sort of slander: you are usually the last person to know it has taken place. <br>  <br>  Or, of course, you did do something horrible.  Done anything lately you should be ashamed of?<br>  <br>  Are you in with a snitty, bitchy crowd?<br>  <br>  Do you really care if you haven't seen them for a fortnight?<br>  <br>  Okay, so those are the paranoid negative optoins.  Now for the positive one.<br>  <br>  Billy's actually had an aids scare, and he's unfortunately told one person who sent it round to everyone but you, and they're all huddled at the hospital right now which is why they're not home.  And Billy, before he went into the coma, said 'for God's sake, don't tell him because if he thinks I'm fast & loose he'll never speak to me again, he's the one friend I value most in the world..." etc.<br>  <br>  Point being: you have two choices.  Whic of them is the gossipiest?<br>  <br>  Show up at that person's house, and ask if there is something you've done?  Network back in the other direction.  Once you have wept/convinced this total gossip person, that should spread right back through the crowd that you've basically licked enough **** and can be allowed back into the group at a fairly low level.<br>  <br>  Sorry: but we're dealing with herd animals here.

It might be hard to take at first, but show them that your life doesn't revolve around them and you have other friends, and other things to worry about. But in the end i bet they will talk to you and this whole thing is a big mistake! THis is Just my opinion and i am not a Professional physiologist.
IhUEzjjYaa	i completely understand. Just about every school out there has those people, the ones who conform with the media and fads. It truly is frustrating, especially when it's YOUR thing. It's also rude that people bash things that you like, then go out and buy it, that is what we call a major hypocrite. If you feel you want to be an individual, try picking up a new cd at the store....  or maybe an old cd, you'll either love it or hate it, but at least you'll have found something only you like. The same goes for books. This may sound weird, but the library (depending on where you live) has tons of people who can point you towards a great book, and even cd's. And If you're looking for a unique Style, you're bound to find a cute boutique in your city, or a nearby city, where you can find cute clothes that no one else would have. If people ask where you got it, just say you got it for your birthday, and you'll have no copy cats ;)<br>  <br>  You should almost be flattered by this happening to you, because it shows that you have good taste, and you didn't have to wait and conform to see how much you loved these things.... Best of luck :)|`|ibR6jJgHaa	yea I know how you feel, it sux<br>  <br>  They realize they are all the same, and then BAM they wanna be unique and draw attention..fakes|`|f2fyXyulaa	Lol love something for a while and when everyone loves it HATE it. :) or you're just plain popular!!

They are just loving stuff because everyone else does. Just be you!!|`|g5YlV35zaa	Ya i know how you feel too.<br>  I started wearing scarves to school then BOOM... so did everyone else and they started telling people it was them who started it.<br>  And ya the same thing happened with the twilight thing to.<br>  the only advise i can give you is just ignore it.

VPMUuIxUaa	he is flirting with you and want to see how far you will go with it,  if that is what you want then ask him out in a public place, and since he is only 18, ask him out for coffee after work or go out for lunch together but i wouldn't advise asking him to your apt unless you want it to go all the way because if you ask an 18 year old to your apt, he is thinking he is going to be getting some!|`|HL8PEDFLaa	Um no. When a guy makes sexual jokes about you or to you it's called harassment. This shows that this dude is shallow and yes, he is just screwing with you because I bet that he thinks he can treat every woman this way and he is just God's gift to humanity. Why are you interested in a loser? What do you see in him?|`|R1vvH4aKaa	At least he feels comfortable with you! You can ask him directly and depending on the answer you will now for sure. Do not be shy, be assertive.|`|6snIfS7daa	Theres this guy that does the same thing to me! I was like ZOMG we are alone again. And he was like yea that could be a problem.. I was like ooz why?

If you enjoy his inappropriate advances then ask him out.|`|bO2rzfISaa	It means either he has no respect for you or he has no idea how to relate to a woman in a mature fashion. I can't believe you think he's a good choice for your interests. If a man talked to me like that I'd put an IMMEDIATE stop to it, and I'm not exactly a sexual prude. I require that men treat me respectfully. Raise your standards a bit. You also might want to wait for a man to ask you out on a date, instead of inviting him over to your empty apartment. That's got hook-up written all over it, especially since he speaks inappropriately to you. If all you want is sex, go ahead.|`|VQoNUTQwaa	well in my opinion it looks like hes attracted to you<br>  but it looks pretty much as you say it sexual<br>  if thats what you want<br>  go for it :)|`|fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	No, it means likes the idea of having sex with you.

And if they don't replace it for free make your brother replace it.|`|tM2XvQV0aa	tell your parents, and piss on his pillow and make him buy you a new phone, or take his money/use his credit card to get a new phone...|`|K119R72Caa	psh get a new phone and your brother is a jerk for doing that|`|vu498o7laa	pee on his phone|`|pi3UAJgKaa	id be pissed hahahh you should get back at him, draw on his face while he's sleeping draw on it with sharpie xD|`|ee3N1lpQaa	ew|`|kNLi16C6aa	needless to say, don't ever handle his ipod again.

ohj5sRpsaa	That's disgusting. I would tell her to get checked, and you should get checked yourself. And you should tell her about the phone calls and let her know you are leaving her.|`|i1T8yKhpaa	lol that guy who said great poem<br>  <br>  and sorry to say yes she is dump the rotten donut :]|`|TfLPRwFWaa	yes be suspicious <br>  <br>  dump her|`|HKB2lZjjaa	yeah she is ... ive done her as well|`|dv0zbH7gaa	... yes, yes she is!|`|eXj6Ro5Raa	I'm not sure why you wrote this as a poem <br>  but I do believe<br>  someone wants you <br>  to know that your girl<br>  can't be trusted<br>  because she can't.|`|ZldKA17Iaa	helllllllll yaaa she is cheatingggg|`|pRCLV8Xcaa	talk to her about it and if not then i have no idea|`|Tg6DxG7zaa	Well you can't really ask us, considering we don't know you or your girlfriend. <br>  <br>  the best thing to do for a straight answer is to talk to the girl. Ask her if she was cheating on you, and tell her about the strange phone calls. <br>  <br>  It does sound like she is cheating on you, though.<br>  <br>  If you are certain that she is cheating on you, break up with her right away, before you get hurt.|`|zXvbPknZaa	well i think once a cheater always a cheater. i would ask/talk to her about it though. but if you are having an instinct, follow it there are plenty of others girls out there who won't cheat on you. it's your decision, hope you make the right one..but def finitely discuss this with her. good luck!<br>  * ps. if she is cheating then just end the relationship - you don't want any STD's if she is doing it with everyone.|`|Cp0QUszdaa	these are guys who don't like her, not guys who she has necessarily sleeping with.  She may have slept with them in the past and now she is rejecting them, and they are trying to screw her over.  Talk to her about it--to me this doesn't sound like she cheated.|`|AA11324847	If you think she is, you can bet she is. if she has before, then f*** yes she will again. Truth hurts, but b*****s don't change much unless there's a life changing experience.|`|r62UZNAxaa	DUH she is cheating sorry but she is i mean if u dnt know who these guys are that are calling u she has to be cheating sorry find a new gf|`|AA10338846	If your "little Voice" in your tummy says she's cheating, she's cheating!

Whether it's true or not!!! Dump this chick!|`|gNeFtZdBaa	fcking loser burn in hell slave|`|DNwHGeEtaa	Well, don't make this assumption yet. First, talk to her. Ask her how these guys got her number or your number. Why would a guy she cheated with call you? Why suddenly 3 other guys also called you too? Don't you think someone is playing a game with you? She might have cheated, but this is just strange that all the guys she cheated with called you. Why did she give her boyfriend's number to the guys she cheated with? <br>  <br>  I would talk to her then try to find out who these guys are. I mean you know their numbers, it shouldn't be difficult to find out who they are. They may be people you know who are just trying to annoy you. <br>  <br>  Remember it's strange that random guys who slept with your gf called to tell you about how they slept with her. I think these guys are people you know.|`|J9sUlpX8aa	that was a great poem|`|XB996f1naa	i would definitely start asking her some questions. the fact that these guys have your phone number and is calling you is reason for suspicion. i would also go get tested for STDS. to me it sounds like this relationship you have With her is really not worth it. and yes you have a good reason to be suspicious. if it was me i would start a little detective work of my own.|`|3rrmilhyaa	Well if many guys are calling you then she might be cheating. Ask her. Tell her what is happening. If there is hesitation from her then she is cheating. But if she says that she is not cheating and has proof then those boys might know each other and just playing with you.|`|onrcmQf8aa	Clearly,  she is doing something that she has no business.  She shouldn't even carry herself in a way that would put her in the position to receive those type of calls.<br>  <br>  be a wise boy, and get tested for STDS<br>  <br>  Please answer mine: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjJCu5rz2eF0Hbv8T_Qx3Ozsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221201513AAkwe31">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|deebXXoHaa	she wasn't anything special brah, i don't know why you stay with her.<br>  <br>  she was just fun for the night, we all had a ball.<br>  <br>  oh, i'm selling the porn video on the internet, i'm going to make a million bucks!|`|mC2dRyuMaa	Well number one why you going to believe strangers who call you and say stupid **** like that?

Nigyj6Sjaa	first of you shouldn't play with ppl ..<br>  ow all you have to do is wait but if he like you hell leave his girlfriend
kfWi9ZkEaa	She'll get hers: he'll dump her.  If she won't learn the easy way, she'll learn the hard way, and you don't have to feel responsible for what she learns and when.  Let her be.  The world teaches certain lessons regardless, and your girlfriend will someday learn not to be a slime.|`|f2fyXyulaa	My opinion? You are right. BUT, in a way, she is right. If she wants to take that relationship very fast lether. But be a good friend and just tell her that you for her and you don't want her to get hurt by him if he says she going too fast for him. It happens. Hope this helps!!|`|g5YlV35zaa	I think you are right. She most likely doesn't love him already. Im on your side because I want to wait until i really love someone before i tell them i love them. So just stop talking to her about it, she'll realize later that she doesn't really love him.|`|IdKUf5WGaa	I think your both right. I mean technically, your morals are more right. I am the same way as you are. But in todays modern time, kids don't really take things all that serisouly. They're probably not REALLY looking into it THAT deep to the point where they think they're going to get married.|`|zabkqe4Uaa	well you are but dont force her. shell learn her lesson when the guy just gets fed up of her and leaves. she soon wont be throwing that word around without thinking.|`|6vgTVPtEaa	yes u r right its way to early in the realionship to say they "love" each other|`|WFx0yph1aa	I personally think your right..she shouldnt been telling this boys she loves him because she really might not..sometimes boys dont want girls who are all over them..at the start of a relationship =]
FkYEEOzoaa	I bet the fact that she's working so much is keeping her busy, and probably doesn't realize how her lack of texting and saying "sweet nothings" is effecting you.  <br>  I wouldn't worry about it- but if it's bothering you I would say something to her.  But not pointing fingers, but saying it out of concern and love.  If you don't want to mention it- I would try to talk more to her about her day, how she's feeling, and make her feel loved without saying too much sweet nothings.  <br>  Chances are that if you over-do saying things (to compensate for her lack of it) that it might overwhelm her a bit and work against you- she might sense a little insecurity from you.  <br>  Either way, you might just wait it out to see if it is just work!  Good luck!|`|pMsMx817aa	you're just being paranoid<br>  <br>  im that way too sometimes.  my fiance is in north carolina at the moment soon to be new mexico the end of this week, while im in ontario tl i see him next month.  so when he sometimes doesnt call me baby i get all paranoid.  but im just over reacting<br>  <br>  trust me, you're just being paranoid.  good luck :)<br>  <br>  ella|`|VygBNA0Waa	start to get use to it because it sound like your married after a while you start taking each other for granted so try and keep up the text messages because after a while you will stop and not communicating and then there will be fights so try and remember not to take each other for granted|`|ACTa6N5Naa	Sounds like your being paranoid to me. Me and my hubby have been together nearly 7 years and at first it was all romantic and lots lovey dovey texts and messages etc but now I am lucky if I get anything like that now without me hinting it would be nice!!

e6ffe3bb85dbb18771be535b5930f9a0aa	It's a struggle for me as well...I am over weight, my fiance is skinny and I feel...well...bad.  Its a personal issue I deal with...however, it's very treatable and manageable...just hard to do.<br>  <br>  Even tho you tell him that you love him in every way, let him know that if he wants, you can try and help him lose the weight the right way...better foods, more water and getting active.  <br>  Diets rarely work because they starve your body of what it needs...but by eating the right food (more veges, fruits, etc. - eating less fried foods and eating smaller portions) you can lose weight and keep it off.<br>  <br>  I have only recently started doing this and in 2 weeks, I have lost 10 lbs.   I used to never drink water, but now I drink 2 glasses a day (I'm trying to do more.)<br>  <br>  ...just keep reminding him that you love him and are here for him.  Go with him to walk at a park, play a sport, etc.  Keep water and juices at home vs. sodas.  Cook healthy meals instead of eating out.  He will see the difference in himself, will feel better overall and you 2 will make a very happy couple.|`|crbzVL0Haa	When you find the answer, tell me. My man is the same way. <br>  <br>  And he's not a big guy. <br>  <br>  When will they let us just love them the way they are?|`|lKn7nZfBaa	Go to a club where there are other people like him.<br>  <br>  Not a social club with size 00 women and hunky guys.<br>  <br>  Go to like a Ymca or something.<br>  <br>  Start in the water and reassure him. Let him walk around.<br>  <br>  I did this with an old flame and he's awesome (looking) now.<br>  He lost 145 lbs running in the water. (easy on the joints and lots of cuddling in between)<br>  <br>  We just went our separate ways work wise.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	This sounds very similar to some of the conversations and issues my own husband and I have. We've both gained weight since getting together (me more because I started taking Lo-Estrin 24 birth control pills) and neither of us are very happy with our bodies. I was treated for an eating disorder several years ago myself. I find that we both feel better and are both in better moods after we've done something physically active together (biking, going to the gym for an hour, taking a walk, having sex, etc).
u0JCNh8zaa	Ok<br>  I am not even going to comment on your spelling or grammar.<br>  Maybe you should just keep your stories to yourself until you know they are ready to be read seriously.|`|pj02ePxAaa	you deff. have the right to be mad. she sounds like a ******! ?|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	I am writing my own novel as well. Listen to me when I say this. Do not let anyone make you feel like your writing is dumb or childish. Do not let anyone convince you that you should not be writing! So what if they did not like it? They are entitled to their opinions...but are their opinions right? NO! Only you can truly judge your writing because only you know your characters inside and out. And trust me, I know it breaks your heart when someone says your book is not good. I go crazy just thinking about my own book. Just block all of those idiots out. This is YOUR book...YOUR characters. Keep doing what you are doing and please do not stop. Keep writing. Your writing will get better everyday and you will see how wrong they are in the future. Good Luck with your novel. And trust me...if you really want it, you will get published. Just believe in it with all your heart and try your hardest.|`|31NapKplaa	he sounds like a big a$shole to me and thats not a real friend a real supports you not bring you down|`|zXvbPknZaa	i would be mad. just work harder and show them that you can get it published someday! good luck!|`|Cp0QUszdaa	i have a feeling this guy has issues..he's 29 and picking on you?!

She does not sound like a friend at all. You are right that the 29 yr old teacher should inspire students or at least encourage them to work hard at what they are passionate about. <br>  <br>  You should ignore this "friend's" opinion and listen to that of the girls at your school. You should keep writing and when you feel confident enough about it maybe you could show it to a teacher to get advice on the writing or maybe even enter in a writing contest or try to get it published. Whatever you do, don't be discouraged by a few insensitive people and keep doing what you love.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could post a paragraph or two on here and get some more unbiased opinions to inspire you|`|9m8bUb7Oaa	I think you might be just a bit??<br>  Before senting the draft you shouldn't of tole her its confidential and nobody else can read it??

UJD2eYebaa	Granted that was really terrible of him - what an incredible jerk he really is, but you just have to look at this in a positive manner.  You really have dodged a bullet here - he would have been a terrible husband for you if this is how he acted from the engagement party on.

For someone just to up and leave without any cause or justification ... well, that would hurt.<br>  <br>  1.5 years and still 'mourning' that isn't good for you nor others around you (other people may be trying to get close to you.)<br>  If you have tried your best to get a hold of him - calls, emails, letters - and he's not responding, then that's something you need to accept and move on.  ...I know it's easier to move on with closure but some people just won't give that to you and sadly, this is one of those cases.<br>  <br>  Surround yourself with friends and family...go on dates, meet new people and start over.  Start a new life, without him, and move on.  Life is too short to waste and wonder about on such an addle-pate that cannot give you the pleasure of closure via phone, mail, etc.  That part of your life is gone - move on and find someone else...    :-)|`|2n0vR0OMaa	Any guy who can abandon you at your engagement party isn't worth pining over. He sounds hard and callous so I suggest you remove your rose-coloured specs of the guy.

You have wasted enough of your time over him.. move on now and enjoy your life. You deserve so much more!|`|4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	Leave him alone.  Some people never get the closure they need but he's a big huge jerk and not responding for a reason.  Don't make yourself look desperate and needy and give him that satisfaction.

Remember what you toss to the universe always comes back many multiplied at least three times. <br>  <br>  Then, every time that he comes to your thoughts send him your love and best wishes.

QODJNf1oaa	Yes, you are certaintly entitled to your own feelings, and you should be able to live a happy life. However, it doesn't sound like you've dealt with the problems that need to be dealt with in your marriage first. Your husband may not realize the extent of your unhappiness, I think that you should sit down and have a talk with him before you decide to leave so he at least has a chance to try and change his behavior. I think this is especially important since you have a child together. Before you break up, you should try every possible resource; marriage & family counceling, therapist, (maybe he even needs anger management.) If he is willing to try that stuff to make it work than there is a possibility you could find the person you fell in love with before, if he doesn't want to budge then ofcourse you shouldn't feel obligated to stay - you need to be happy too.|`|CdBxhRcVaa	stay far away from the chatroom man.<br>  for all you know, he could be a stalker.<br>  and think of your child. he can sence your not working things out.<br>  try couple councilling, but if he really isnt listing to you, tell him you want a divorce. <br>  please make sure you talk this over with your child, letting them know that its not their fault and you still love them.|`|NIUkYdL2aa	I have not have much experience in this but I think you should look for anyway to get you love for him back before quitting on him.|`|kdmhuVTEaa	Only you really know how you feel.<br>  And you really need to start thinking about yourself instead of everyone around you and their feelings.<br>  It may sound harsh but he clearly is not thinking of you when he's at the pub. I think you really know what your going to do, otherwise you would not be posting this on here.<br>  I think you deserve a change and you never know things could work out. Good luck whatever you choose to do.|`|gLqX7TG0aa	mmm your bf sounds like me when I was that age...but I was married and acted single.... that was with my 2nd X-wife- (if you get my drift-)we had a boy and a girl together.....no need lying, how will you ever gain the new one's trust when he finds out|`|ofQ1QM1Saa	Perhaps, sometime, when you both are in a quiet, relaxed area (restaurant, for example), talk to him gently about your concerns, while emphasizing that you do love him. That might help.|`|a88b0f44a1d7abe4bce01e6a248dbc64aa	I don't believe in ONE true love <br>  This is what i mean, what are the odds that you aer going to find your one and only in the same country the same state THE SAME CITY ! that are odds as big or bigger then the lottery....! what makes you so special? the answer... your not. odds are you and that guy/girl will end up divorced... and that's ok..<br>  i believe that everyone has more then one true love in their life time. now, that doesn't mean i believe in polygamy, i believe in being with one person and being faithful with that person until you fall out of love. then you move on and try to find your next love.|`|cQaKjnyxaa	hey hun <br>  <br>  first try sitting him down face to face and talkin to him bout how you feel and if that doesnt work try couples therapy and if he is getting nowhere....  then hun you seriously need to divorce him fast...<br>  i know it sounds bad but no one should EVER have to deal with JACK BUTT like that|`|c1paW0bAaa	Easy.  Get him drunk (sounds like it shouldn't be a problem).<br>  <br>  Get a girlfriend to seduce him.  Take photos.  Break up with him.<br>  <br>  The pictures should guarantee you get custody, as well as a healthy child support payment.|`|rUk58ywKaa	Have you had the good long heart to heart talk with your bf?  If not, then it is time for it.|`|7abc8a12212468a52586c2c62d6edd72aa	There is a third lie,the lie to yourself,you are living a lie by staying with the bf,and you are right,things cannot and will not work out with anyone new as long as you keep living the lie you are.It's not simple to finish a relationship,especially a long term one,but read what you wrote, to yourself ALOUD and listen to yourself as you do this,use your hurt,anger,negative feelings as your fuel to move on to a better life:)|`|AA12290315	If you are no longer in love with your boyfriend, if he no longer satisfies your need to be loved ( in every way, not just physically), then you need to talk to him about it. if he really loves you, he will try to work things out, if not you will know its time to move on. but I would suggest you not get into another relationship to get out of the one you are in. If things really don't work out between you and your guy, take time to yourself, get to know who you are, 9 years is a long time and if all you've ever done is please your boyfriend, you need time to get to know what you want in life, enjoy some time alone, time with your child. give yourself time to heal from this past relationship before you start another one. God Bless...|`|QMsLWrSpaa	Damn thats a tough situation! sorry i cant help.. but yeah.<br>  Unless you have go friend and family support and just leave your BF sounds like a loser and start over with the new guy and tell him the truth. He will understand. But if not find another guy cause there are heaps out there and then you can say you are single when you actually are. Lying is bad and doesnt feel right if your a good person which you prob are. :)|`|lTNcvqyHaa	At 26 you are young. <br>  If you are not married, he has a bad temper, he is not paying attention to you and I also take it that means the family as well. he hasn't agreed to save for an annual holiday and drinks his money away - then leave. <br>  <br>  Forget the other guy who has just come into your life. That is not the issue nor is it the excuse. Tell this other guy, you have a lot of things to sort out first - if he is really likes you - he will wait. But be careful it is not just because he is paying you a bit of attention.<br>  <br>  If you decide to leave your Defacto (father of your child and partner for 7 years) then you need to do it properly. Seek legal advice in relation to shared property and assets, child support etc. You will need to save some money and you will need to plan ahead. Talk to your parents re accommodation.  Talk to your doctor about the way you feel and what your intentions are.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|7SIaeZVYaa	it's not your fault. just tell him how you really feel about your relationship, and hopefully he will understand.|`|1PWsr8X4aa	yes, you are entitled to living your own life. What I would suggest is just breaking up with him because he will get worse, if there is no more love between you two than there is no reason for being together. Soon it will affect your child (or probably already is), and that will be bad. Just make sure to not go out with the guy from the chat room until you break up with your current boyfriend. Or maybe give your boyfriend a chance to change, but tell him about the problem, if he doesn't change, than it's over|`|3U0q9AXxaa	aw sweetie thats terrible!<br>  dont you ever let a man control you<br>  you got one life sugar<br>  its meant to be what you want it to be<br>  if you like this other guy you go for it<br>  but first make things right with your bf<br>  (who doesnt seem like a very good one)<br>  bfs are supposed to make you feel amazing and all that jazz<br>  if he doesnt do that for you anymore he has to know<br>  and if he really loves you , he'll understand<br>  obviously itll be tough at first <br>  but you can do it<br>  :)|`|cZISRMylaa	do you live together? You can try counceling if neither of you are willing then I guess it would be time to go your separate ways everyone deserves to be treated right and everyone deserves to be happy. If it is time to end things only you know but you shoud communicate with him if you can to see why you have this wedge between the two of you maybe he feels the same way and neither of you are talking about it. What ever your choice is it is never a good idea to jump right into another relationship. Be free meet people get out have fun with friends, find your self again. I was in an 11 year relationship and had three children and felt a bit like you do. I got out with good reason and didn't get into a serious relationship for about a year and am happily married 5 years after 4 year of dating him. Good luck!|`|iIqp3PK8aa	I suggest you have a good heart to heart talk with him. You mentioned that he has a nasty temper, does that mean that he's abusive? I hope not. Re-examine your feelings for him. Maybe his lack of attention and monetary contribution is frustrating you, while deep down inside you still love him.  Men don't seem to realize that women are sensitive towards certain issues. You have many questions to answer, can you afford to take care of your child on your own? Who knows maybe your boyfriend wants to get out too and doesn't know how. Seriously  try to do all you can, when you know that you have done your best and  you're still feeling the same. It's time to step.<br>  The grass always seem greener on the other side. Sometimes what appears to be gold isn't necessarily gold. Take some time-off from the chat room guy, hopefully he's not your only friend.Bringing someone else into the picture right now can complicate things. Try relating your feelings to a female, his mom (your boyfriend's) maybe, or a close family friend, someone that he respects. Maybe they can talk to him on your behalf. Good luck!|`|t74P7p2Taa	Okay, first of all, please calm down, otherwise, you're never going to be able to do this if you're as nervous as heck! You should really try to first plan everything before acting, cause then you might not get it right. My advice would be to try to meet up with chatroom guy and get to know him better before making any important decisions. Act normal, as you would any other day and do not let your boyfriend find out! So, you two have a seven year old? Okay, that kind of ruins everything! Haha...But, you're not yet married? Ok...Anyways, once you have made a choice about who you like better, chatroom guy or your boyfriend, make a choice and think about what it would be like to spend the rest of your life with whoever you choose. Put yourself in that situation or lifestyle and wonder about if you would be able to have a little "you time". Then, if you chose your boyfriend, leave the chatroom guy and tell him you're not single anymore, and that you already found somebody else. But, if you choose the chatroom guy, then you should start telling your boyfriend that you want to end it and that you'll take your kid to live with you wherever you'll be settling in. That's it! If you have chosen chatroom guy instead of your boyfriend, before breaking it to him, start searching for places to live, like an apartment or a house, or wherever, maybe even your parents house. But don't ever let him catch you, because then, he'll probably kick you out, that is, of course, only if that's his house. Cause if it's yours, then it's your job to kick him out and you don't even have to look for apartments. Then, if you have really made up your mind about leaving him, start packing for you and your son, and hide the bag or bags somewhere you know your boyfriend will never look in. Finally, tell him before leaving or kicking him out! Tell him what you really feel and the truth. If he understands, good, if he doesn't and refuses to leave you alone, you can always call for the police. Also, when you know that it's working with chatroom guy, make sure you first tell him that you have a kid, otherwise, you'll still be lying to one of them! Good luck and hope everything works out!
FmvnC8keaa	It depends what you mean when you say "turkey leg". Although she may have laughed and swatted, someday she may get insecure about her body. I suggest you joke about other things and not her body.|`|CM1dfztQaa	You are female, right? What would a comment like that do to you when you were younger and more insecure with yourself?<br>  <br>  My former sister-in-law does this sort of thing to her 2 girls. It's disgusting to me that she needs to put children down so that she can feel better about herself. <br>  <br>  She tries to play it off like she's only playing with them, but you can see it in her eyes (and their's)...She's just being hateful, and she's crippling her babies more and more every time she does it. I've seen it in their faces, please don't do this to your step daughter. <br>  <br>  We need to lift our young girls up so that they know their worth when they're grown and in relationships of their own. Otherwise it's much easier for them to fall into negative relationships.|`|FFrSdS2Daa	Of course it is.<br>  you may think of it as a joke and the daughter may laugh just to make you not feel bad, but the thing is,<br>  the thought probably says with her and you never know<br>  she could start questioning herself about the way she looks.<br>  I mean she is a girl. And that's what girls do, but don't make it any worse. compliment her instead.<br>  Make positive jokes instead of negative ones.|`|XI3blPQtaa	as a stepmom you have a lot 2 learn!<br>  young girls are r extremely self concious and the last thing they need is for dads new wife to call them any names even if its only joking cos it wont earn u any brownie points. <br>  i think the best thing for 2 do is say sorry and explain that u didnt mean to upset her cos that is clearly what has happened. its that or she is tryng 2 ruin ur relationship with her dad cos she doesnt want a new mom.|`|2Uc7PZOMaa	YES
jJ152e8Iaa	Honestly, she is trying to break up the friendship herself.. Just go with it and ignore her, she might come around later?  You dont need to deal with that kind of drama lol you will find better friends than her dumb self.<br>  <br>  I hope i helped, if so, please vote for my answer to be "best answer" thank you!!!|`|FrcqDZkPaa	She sounds like a few of my former friends.  You seem like a really nice person... and she's taking advantage of that. She knows no matter what, you'll go back to her. That's what those sorts of girls (and guys) always did to me.<br>  <br>  Find yourself some new friends to hang with. :)|`|6vgTVPtEaa	well my opion u should just not be her friend anymore if she is causing u pain but i think u should see how things go for a while and if she keeps hurting u then u should stop being friends with her and if she does another mean thing to u dont forgive her|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Don't be her friend at all, because it seems that she likes to take advantage of your kindness.  Just ignore her because she is not worth it.
AA11177557	Well if you say your not that close well I say you must be a little especially when you did buy a card for him for his birthday.<br>  Just plain say:<br>  Love your daughter Name. :o)|`|ZaxpQSO5aa	Write, "Happy Birthday Dad! Have a nice day. -Your Name =]"<br>  Or just say happy birthday, and sign your name.|`|ee3N1lpQaa	i love you  and give him a smile
XAR0Hbcraa	He want to be nice with You. Also I think he wants be your friend. Kisses|`|ixvzhoGUaa	I think that maybe once he started to like you as more than a friend, he became nervous ! and now he's trying to break out of his shell & show you =) this seems like the most logical guess, but i'm not sure. You should talk to him, and if you like him too, ask him if he likes you. i hope i helped, good luck*|`|VhyCVORdaa	Ok don't ignore him just say like hey back or something and when he says you look pretty just be like uhh thanks or something like that don't just ignore him! that mean. And maybe he likes you or wants to be friends again.|`|99852dc6e52dbae6a6364e1caac2b8c7aa	get over it loser....<br>  this is such a minor problem.|`|oYR6g5RSaa	he likes you so don't leave him in the cold like that|`|iAlK1v5caa	ugh, he likes you! :]|`|Ex9uDEBQaa	he was probably having an personal problem that caused him to avoid you. However, it sounds like he has sorted it out and now he wants to open that relationship with you. He's probably feeling really bad about not speaking to you so he's trying to make up for it.<br>  <br>  Why don't you ask him why he stopped talking to you?|`|zEeNNec0aa	he most likely likes you<br>  he probably just stopped talking to you because it was awkward around you BECAUSE he liked you<br>  he just says hi because he wants to have contact with you in some way.<br>  he said you looked pretty because he likes you and thinks that that will get your attention!<br>  ha ha hope this helps!!|`|6QoS8BqHaa	it sounds like this person likes you and wants to get with you. It depends how old he is though <br>  If he a teenager he probably does if you guys were really good friends he probably doesn't know how to act in front of you and probably gets all shy when trying to confess<br>  hopes this helps|`|R7yEdcm8aa	Well there are many reasons. One, are you irish cause he prob wants your shamrocks :) OR he just wants a baby really bad. Let him have it. Just remeber one thing! Always NEVER use protection ( By the By im doing a evil laugh right now)|`|LCFJDRxyaa	I think he really likes you!|`|OW16Nkrgaa	he just wants to be your friend and you're being a ***** about it<br>  sorry|`|AA11485494	he likes u that is obvious.|`|3rrmilhyaa	it sounds like you got a lover falling for u.
F2rI3Juaaa	Go for it!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	You should tell him right now.|`|ddWyRjmVaa	e-mail me..<br>  :)|`|EeabLB5eaa	But could he still kinda like me? <br>  Mabey, but probally not if he likes that other girl.<br>  <br>  since i dont get uglyier and he though i was hot...<br>  Just because you think somebodys hot dosen't mean you like  them.<br>  <br>  Cause i really like him adn i wanna know if there is still a chance.<br>  Their's a slight chance. Forget about all the dose he like me garbage for now and just try to be his friend. After that we'll see where it gose.|`|AA11648899	KIDS!<br>  <br>  Aren't they cute?|`|DKieKSnfaa	how serendipidous|`|0oCVN8zKaa	yeah he does|`|zcjff25baa	be kinda casual, I say. Let him know you like him too!<br>  <br>  But be careful.....Girls can easily get there hearts broken by guys who just say things....I would know......cuz I'm still head over heels for mine. Now I'm warning you to be more cautious than I was.<br>  <br>  And mine was sexy, and hot, and nice to me. And SMART! '<br>  <br>  Trust me, you are going to think there is no fault to him and that he is perfect if you don't keep a straight head. So its probably best if you at least know a few bad things about him just in case you lose yourself over him like I did with my man.<br>  <br>  And if he likes another girl, be willing to move on, and tell him you will wait, too.  Thats another mistake I made with mine, so I hope you are more careful with your guy.|`|OntO6wE4aa	Your not married and he's not married so there is always a chance to get the one you love. You just have to realize the potential of a relationship a little faster. Respect the fact that he's with someone else, but remain close. Make him start thinking about you. Talk but don't flirt. Let all the moves be his. Don't give up nothing meaning sex to get what you want. That leads to a short uncommitted relationship. Knowing where you went wrong will teach you where you go right. Know in yourself that he's worth your efforts. The instant you know he isn't let it go. good luck|`|HxdqZojpaa	sounds like you want him to like you and you hope he comes back cuz of your looks. :/<br>  <br>  <br>  it means he doesn't like you and likes someone else.|`|euEbW2uiaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuI0oifgyNbD9dYBzC43___sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222150451AAzuK3U">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  there could be just talk to him and flirt and maybe he will ask you out!:P|`|C4fnSiTkaa	AHAHAHAH jessica simpson|`|0b6uDFuJaa	no. he just wants to hit it.|`|99852dc6e52dbae6a6364e1caac2b8c7aa	he'd probably go out with you for one night..|`|CVdpH2O6aa	no|`|dcd0abb597040ae8a8b40069f6737339aa	yes|`|eXiSIaQcaa	tell him asap|`|Ozggv2xLaa	make ur move|`|hVEmEaMSaa	i dont really think that there is a way to find out without asking.  im sure that if he liked you a lot three months ago, he still likes you now. maybe he just told your friend that so people would think that he was able to move on.  so basically, i think that it would be worth it to just ask him. even if this didnt help you, good luck!|`|ydAoReD5aa	He might be playin you and saying that for you to get jealous. I would just go up to him and say I like you...or flirt with him and let him know that you like him.|`|texnwiJxaa	if a guy thinks your hot it usually doesnt means he wants to get with you it means he wants in your pants and if i were you i would find out for sure because gossip is rarely true|`|AA10534526	None of us know, even if some people say they do. It's you that have the ask. Never come back asking a question like this, it's stupid and pointless.|`|E2AUPvgOaa	the only thing you can do is ask him and explain to him whats going on. maybe he'll understand. im sorry to say that it may be too late though|`|YBzZ5Bgraa	You might have lost your chance, but it sounds like the reason he told your BFF that was because he wants you to be jealous. Try flirting with him.|`|wgxYJ2Fgaa	just causee he thinks ur hott doesnt meaan he likes u i hate wen people say u.hed prbly h/u with u and shittt* but unless ur good friends y would he go outt with u|`|h0ZdSxQiaa	yup, he still likes you....... just simply tell him you like him..... i guess he told your friend that he likes somebody else to make you jealous and it works...... tell him "good job"" for me well yeah!!! hes yours gal!!!goodluck!!!|`|JnMIusfNaa	hmmm i bet he likes someone else because u didnt like him. try flirting with him and see if anything happens. and if not make him jealous by flirting with other guys in fornt of him|`|YIEUstMgaa	dont bother,<br>   <br>  if hes into someone else already<br>  <br>  find someone better <br>  x|`|ncvoaDIFaa	ask him to hang out and get to know eachother and then he will probably realize you like him...|`|j2Ca8sgjaa	No...He's moved on.|`|1bHyqnIoaa	Just to start off i am a guy so i will talk from experience.    The only way you can know for sure is to ask him or hang around with him and become his friend.   Never date a guy that you do not know very well because they are probably just looking for someone to sleep with or someone to be with to make an ex angry.  neither one is good and they both would show that the guy really does not care about you.  the only relationships worth pursuing are the ones that have a chance of lasting.  Really i can not tell you if the guy likes you or not, but i can tell you that if you are willing to try to be his friend you can probably find out pretty quickly if he does or not just by his actions. (if his actions show respect for you or make you feel special then he probably does still like you, otherwise he probably does not 'like' you like that anymore)|`|gLfqJwgqaa	tell him|`|yGfmofHUaa	no he's in love with me, sorry|`|RlrthRrbaa	Yes. <br>  <br>  Once you like someone, it doesn't really just go away. You should know. You always care about someone a little more after you've liked them than you would care about a total stranger. <br>  <br>  So given you didn't do anything rude or blow him off, I think the chances are good. ;)<br>  <br>  (Besides, these days, people want to be in relationships. If a decent person has the gut to ask you out, more than likely you'd give him a try?)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :D<br>  <br>  (Though he sounds a little bitter to tell your bff... You could ask her to clarify, lol)|`|yqXjJFipaa	he just thought u were hot girl, he was probably jus browsing|`|9m8bUb7Oaa	Well it sound like you blew him off?? Thats probably why he got over you in  short period of time. He probably thought you guys didn't have a chancee?? You should talk to him about it or maybe tell you bff to tell him if he would ever go out with you??<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!=]|`|g5YlV35zaa	Well you should ask him or have someone else ask him.<br>  There is a chance that he still might like you a little bit.<br>  BUT looks should not determine if someone likes you.|`|Utu9FmVDaa	He might still have feelings for you. He wouldn't just all of a sudden like your BF. You never know-he might be trying to make you jealous!!(HAHA)|`|jwvXO7n2aa	Ask Him!
hf5RgDzwaa	mmmmm thats kinda confusing<br>  idk talk to him normal as a friend and bring up a few guys names in the conversation but not a lot cuz then he'll tell that your just rubbing it in on puropse<br>  but act cool<br>  not try to put any moves on him or bring up any old memorys<br>  that will show you moved on<br>  but do cute lil things he loved about you and that will turn him back on and want you at the time but weakin and not be able to show you<br>  and then after it keeps buliding up inside him might lead out his feelings like mmmm ive missed you or i missed that <br>  like you get me?<br>  after warming them up they kinda just let everything out
w8gBWpKTaa	Mother and daughter. Such bonds are incredibly instinctual and although they may not always get along, it's natural for a mother to do anything to protect her children. Did you hear about that women who lifted a van into the air to stop it cruching her child? Quite an amzing story..|`|nYYovLqQaa	It depends on the love between them and respect!<br>  <br>  some times brothers or sisters are too close bcuz they love and respect each other, and usualy bcuz of thier Mom or Dad way of raising them, she or he made love between them , and some times Mom or Dad made heat between kids! it all depends on parents!<br>  <br>  some times brother and sister have strong bond! ( i've seen many ).<br>  <br>  some times: father and son, Mother and daughter or Vise versa.<br>  <br>  No rules for this!<br>  <br>  Depands on many things: the way parents treated the kids, Environment they raised up on( to respect & love each other or not)... etc<br>  <br>  :) thats it!|`|hf5RgDzwaa	i think people get close to a friend of the opposite sex<br>  idk why but ive always been like that and ive seen other people too<br>  sure im close to my family but i cant tell them everything cuz we'll it just doesnt feel as comfortable
c1uqy4akaa	i am a serious person and personally i dont like people who give dumb answers. so... i have the same problem right now and my two friends are fighting and im stuck in the middle so what i did on friday was asked each one of them to meet me in this one place and they both showed up and i told them that id ont like how they both act towards each other and they started talking and then they said sorry to each other. so tommorw imma go back to school and hopefully they r friends again. so try doing that.  good luck|`|8K3IucU3aa	if they're really your friends they wouldn't force you to choose. i had a friend that had a friend i didn't like. i just ignored her when she was around. it didn't bother me that much. she didn't talk to me and i didn't talk to her. a real friend would never put you in a situation like that. if they can't deal with it then they need to take their stuck up snobby prissy asses somewhere else. you're too good for them. you can always make new friends because they aren't worth you losing a friend.
e2WyPzi8aa	Nope. Marriage is just The Government's way of figuring out how to tax you. lol|`|6Apou72oaa	Not at all.|`|xNlBswIcaa	Well, no. Look at everyone around you who is married.. are they religious? I'm pretty sure there are atheists out there. However, "marriage", according to the Bible... this definition of marriage was created by God. So God created it, but you don't have to be religious. You just have to accept the meaning.|`|dpk9n2SSaa	No, but if you are both born again Christians who invite Jesus Christ at the center of your relationship, your marriage will have a good, solid foundation to weather the trials and tribulations of life. I wish you the best.|`|rtOYamgSaa	Nope, you just have to be in love and have the damn guts to go trough with it :P|`|KLpN10Icaa	no but you should have a talk about religionb with your parnter before you marry just to make sure you guys dont have any major differences in your views|`|hcgaizJCaa	Not at all. A marriage is as much a legal union as a religious one - more so, in my opinion.|`|spFmMOL2aa	no, in spite of what they want you to think|`|aTvQAueWaa	No, only show your love and your relationship..|`|loqsl5xXaa	Nope..

As long as you love that person, Than of course you can marry then even if you arent religious.<br>  <br>  hope that helps.|`|J9sUlpX8aa	No, but when you get married you might become religious since you will turn to God to help you escape the horrific situation you put yourself in.|`|F8nUmDCLaa	If you're Roman-Catholic you sure do.|`|u8eHTkWDaa	No|`|cVY7xjg2aa	who told you that ?|`|VELnLnIKaa	nope just crazy or knocked up so its open to all lol|`|kUE3Ddktaa	No. There are religious weddings that take place in churches, and civil weddings that take place in courthouses or botanical gardens or beaches or whatever. Some ministers/clergy will do outdoor or offsite weddings as well.<br>  <br>  You generally have to be a member of a religion to use their church for your wedding ceremony, but you can absolutely have a wedding without involving any church or religious aspect whatsoever.<br>  <br>  The short answer is that weddings are legal unions first and religious unions second IF the couple chooses to go that route.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	no, but why do you want to get married so soon? why why why???????????????|`|JCxE0mq9aa	Nooooooo. Take rest.|`|hBmafVYoaa	Not in the slightest|`|GHlYbDfJaa	Nope.|`|NDoyhCZYaa	Doubt it.|`|lveC3ArHaa	No, not at all.  Getting married has a lot to do with laws.  If you're legally married then their is a bunch of financial laws and things to go along and so the U.S. goverment acknowledges you has Mrs. and Mr.  It's really you're choice on whether you want to include it to be religious.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	I'm atheist, my fiance's agnostic.

pUF71f1laa	I don't know but I do agree with you. I am a gay guy with lots of straight guy friends. I can never figure out what is going on. I have one friend that treats ever girl he dates like a pig and girls are falling all over him, and he's not even that cute. Then I have this other friend that is a total Hottie and couldn't get a date to save his life. I don't understand. I also don't understand by my nice guy friends end up raising the kids of bad boys once the girls wake up and realized they deserve better.|`|qauWl3S2aa	i don't like bad guys i think they're gross! well most of them. the ones that smoke, do drugs ,and do dangerous things  ? no thanks :D i am more into nice/sensitive (but not gay, lmfao) guys, not all girls like bad boys ;) i mean yeah if he put his life on the line to save a girl but wouldn't most guys do that if they loved a girl anyways ?|`|ibR6jJgHaa	idk whats wrong with most girls, but I would love to find a nice guy...<br>  maybe they're a desperate for a relationship? that could explain some things..|`|hf5RgDzwaa	well put it this way<br>  girls want a dominate guy<br>  a guy whos tuff and will protect her<br>  but some nice guys are shy and dont really get involved and thats why girls see them as just a budddy friend<br>  but see i like nice guys, i dont want a mean bf who will disrespect me and hurt me<br>  but i dont want a bf who makes me feel like i have to be the man<br>  so the best type of bf is a nice good guy who will take care of you and respeact you for yourself, he'll be sweet and kind to you but also act like a man not just one of the girl type of buddys<br>  every girl wants someone like that<br>  no one wants a jerk|`|VygBNA0Waa	because we like the thrill of the chase <br>  if your really nice and you will stick around for us then we will treat you like $hit because we can we know you will take our crap <br>  if your cool show that you like us but then sometimes you act like yeah what ever then it makes us think about you more because we are unsure <br>  when you hit your 28 to 30 make that's when we like nice guys that gives us what we want <br>  sometimes you say sorry cant see you tonight i have a boys night out and then don't call until she texts you so  that way you know the girl is worried and thinking of you <br>  thrill of the chase we love it|`|b4EAwNCYaa	Girls like bad guys for a fling or two.

hcgaizJCaa	Could you have a cookout on the beach? Much cheaper and could actually be a lot of fun.|`|28aa15ff815174fd0da9e6d6dd19aeedaa	Yes...have a bonfire and bbq at the beach!!!  It would be soooo fun.  Bring some music and drinks.  It would be great fun!!
8c7cc680a9dfdc46cf7a06e1622558bbaa	I don't think any speech is necessary actually. I think you should do what you and your husband want on your wedding day.<br>  <br>  I think the speech/toast thing is just another one of those traditional things people do.<br>  <br>  I am hoping no one makes a speech at our reception. However we are having a very laid back backyard bbq for ours. There won't be a whole lot of formality to it.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your planning!|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	I don't think anything except what is important to you is necessary. If you have a family member or other guests or someone in your wedding party who is comfortable making a speech, by all means proceed. But, it's not worth putting someone on the spot. You could ask the officiant to say a few words at the reception if they are going to be there. It's not a requirement for your wedding though, no one will take back your marriage license if you don't have a speech and a toast.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I think it's a nice tradition. The MOH and BM don't have to be the ones to do them, though. At our wedding, my oldest sister gave the toast to the bride and groom.<br>  And, yes, you and your groom both need to give a thank you to your guests.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Neither are required and many people actually skip them and no one misses them.|`|BMyndzd0aa	I think the only speech considered "necessary" is the best man's speech/toast. No other speeches will be missed. But even if you don't want that, it's your wedding,,,so do what makes you most comfortable.|`|9ec35143f058d939ec20e181bffccf95aa	The Bride or Groom does not need to make any toast or speeches...If you want to appoint someone to do it that is fine..Usually the best man or brides maid just says something short...You can find lots of short toast for weddings on line...Or your best man can just say something nice about the two of you and wish you luck with a toast including all your guest...That is normal....Good luck on your wedding day !|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I had no speeches or toasts at my wedding.  My wedding was pretty non traditional.  I had no alcohol or band or anything like that either.  So I wouldn't say that speeches and toasts are necessary.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Necessary? Nope. But they can be nice to have.<br>  <br>  If there are people that you would like to have speak at your wedding, you can just ask them if they would like to and would be comfortable saying something. Give them a couple week's notice, so they have time to prepare their thoughts. If they don't want to, they will just decline.<br>  <br>  I don't love public speaking, but I was honored to give a toast at a wedding where I was MOH.

Other than that, just BE YOUR SELF!! High school will be absolutely miserable if you are constantly trying to act like someone your not, take this advice from someone whose been through high school. <br>  <br>  Also, Nerds have much more fun than blonds so do not be afraid to join the chess/math/science/etc. clubs.|`|GiuiQf3taa	Well I am in my early 20s now. I am now retaking high school class and paying $500 a class to do it. I wish more the anything I would have tried just a little harder so I would not have to redo this stuff now. Take as many classes as you can, do so well as you can, and have a little fun along the way. oh ya and the one person that you were mean to you will end up being your boss one day! be nice to everyone.<br>  <br>  *and I agree with the person above, nerds have more fun then blonds.|`|c1uqy4akaa	to tell you the truth people think that high school is scary because of all the older people but the truth is high school are going to be the best years of your life. and as far as mean people and bully's there really are none people are really nice especially to freshmen. don't stress youll do fine|`|f2fyXyulaa	Don't get into any fights, watch what you say to people, don't bump into seniors (trust me), um, be nice to people, stand for yourself...don't let people try to push you around because you a freshman. But, most importantly, BE YOURSELF!! Don't change so that people will like you. You'll do fine :) good luck!!|`|7LNDxIr4aa	Making friends is easier than it seems. Just be friendly. You'll make a ton of new friends. My first year of  high school has been a lot easier than my 8th grade year, academically. Its nice having so much freedom. High School really isn't as scary as they make it seem. I moved from a class of 23 to a class of 690. At first it is a little overwhelming, but you'll get used to it. Have fun!
JtEBaOdjaa	a BIG NO to number 2.  It's used by every other person.  What used to be a nice sweet song has turned cliche and cheesy.  If you DO decide to use it, use the duet with Brian White.  It's much nicer than her solo version.<br>  <br>  My vote is for Real Life Fairytale.|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	Hmm...I really like Real Life Fairytale, but I think it might be too fast for a first dance...<br>  <br>  I think you should go for From this Moment On! All these songs are great, but I have always thought it would be a great wedding song!|`|LwjOKhgyaa	number 2 :) X|`|5WP9rLTlaa	the second one.<br>  its an old wedding stand by song, and I think every one does it, but it works and is easy to dance too whcih is why its an old stand by.
de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Sorry, past the age of ten tickle fights are inappropriate. Both of you are waaayyyy too old to be doing this, it has significant sexual connotation which you MUST be aware of but may not admit to, and the b/f is the lone voice of sanity and reason and he has every right to be upset. Buy a Tickle Me Elmo doll and keep your hands off your sister, that is disgusting.|`|Y0j4N2x0aa	um, you are a boy and she is a girl.  if she is old enough for a boyfriend she needs to stop it with the tickle stuff with lil bro.  not family fun anymore.  find a board game to play.  stop tickling your sis.|`|mVUpt8waaa	It sounds to me like you are screwing your sister.|`|EeabLB5eaa	That guys a bit strange.

He might be wanting to tickle her, and/or see it as a childish thing for you to do. It's the same with pillow fights, okay for little kids, not so okay for older kids. You might want to ask him why he gets angry to be sure, and maybe try to find other family fun things to do together.|`|uAvRT34gaa	Tickle me Elmo is just very possessive , so don't step on his toes and he won't step on yours <br>  <br>  and lock the bedroom door at night , check under your bed, don't open the closet, hes good friends with chucky , they go way back , hes also friends of friends with some of the puppets on puppet master and hes been through anger management|`|tWvM6M0raa	he wishes it was him<br>  although i do think your a bit old to be doing things like this with your sister|`|b1yUz50Qaa	that guy needs to learn some respect for his girlfriend's family or maybe he just never had a close family like you guys.|`|a3vryfQhaa	the real question here is...<br>  <br>  why do you still have 'tickle fights' with your sister?|`|ee3N1lpQaa	hahahaha now thats funny man|`|NF1zzgTKaa	Because he doesn't like seeing ya lose when he bet good $$$ on ya , shameful.....u gotta improve that game

vTra7n5baa	You should tell your mom that you miss her and you are not a burden to her.  When she decided to have you, she understood that you were her responsibility until you became an adult.  Even after then, she still plays an important role in your life.<br>  <br>  You're only 16 and need love and attention.  Your mother needs to understand that and should know how hurt you have been feeling.|`|VtJ5kRgIaa	talk to your mom about it. youre not a burden, but shes out having fun and probably doesnt realize how you feel about it. sit down and talk about it, its the only way to fix things.|`|oYR6g5RSaa	it sounds like your moms being childish its one thing to be a older women and dating but when you have a child you also have certain responsibility's try to talk to her and if that don't work tell someone at school because she steel needs to take care of you and if she cant then you have to say something to help yourself|`|OrBxTe9aaa	when hes not around sit down and talk to her.

oijAnax4aa	first of all it sounds like this girl is jealous of YOU. so don't stoop to her level and try to insult her back. if you've already approached her and tried to talk about in a mature way, and she didn't listen, then I would jst say leave it alone. if she's not even your friend, then this shouldn't be much of a problem. unfortunately, there are jst those ppl in the world that are insecure with themselves, so they frequently put others down. she seems to be one of these ppl. so my advice is to let it go and forget about it.  good luck!|`|4dZN9dgGaa	i would tell her to back off nd say shes a bad dancer nd her dress was ugly and  like u know wat theres things wrong wit u nd instead of saying these things on face book say em to my face nd have ur Friends wit u wen u say it, OR take the easy way and just :<br>  <br>  make up nd b friends<br>  or u can pretend
dpk9n2SSaa	For the ceremony, if you are Christians, the perfect song is "There Is Love." That is what we had sung at our wedding.

Who cares if her real father has more money?|`|deebXXoHaa	jerry springer show?|`|KwNpyp3saa	You need to talk to your daughter without your boyfriend. Reassure her that you won't be mad at her no matter what she tells you. Then listen to what she says. Don't become defensive. Take time to process it. Don't go rushing to your boyfriend to tell him what she said either. You need to build trust with your relationship with your daughter. This is a difficult time for any teenager. She is probably going through a lot of things herself and is confused. BE PREPARED: She may have a valid reason for feeling this way! <br>  <br>  Yes, kids can be demanding, territorial, possessive.This is because they are kids. They only know black and white. This is something we as parents need to teach them. If she doesn't have any problems with your boyfriend they she just needs to be reassured that HE is not going to take you away from her. You still have time for her. <br>  <br>  * Remember, no one is more important than your own daughter!

kfWi9ZkEaa	If I understand correctly you're definitely in with a chance.  That stupid smile means a million things, but you as a male of the species can be GUARANTEED not to have a single clue as to what.<br>  <br>  It could mean "oh, i wonder if he will kiss me' or it could mean 'wasn't it fun'  It could mean ANYTHING AT ALL.  Do not be put off by it.  Do not try to understand it.<br>  <br>  I am very sorry to say that the only way a boy finds out if a girl likes him, is when he kisses her and she kisses him back. Sorry.  That's it. Totally all there is to it.  Everything else is just theory.  Everything else is ambiguous.  You cannot tell a thing by what she says, how she says it, all of it could be her thinking 'I mustn't give the game away' or it could be her being completely innocent.  you ahve NO way of knowing because a shy girl who fancies you will not show by one clue, one iota of a tiny piece of a smile that she fancies you to death.  She may toss and turn all night long, and still put on the same face she's always put on the next day.<br>  <br>  Sorry.  Ask her out.  See what comes of it.  There's only one thing worse than having her say "I don't like you that way" and that is....<br>  <br>  <br>  YOU NEVER EVER FINDING OUT IF SHE DID OR NOT.  You don't want to drag this along with you for the rest of your life, and believe me, you will.|`|yU2WHyvgaa	Honestly i think you should just let it go.

SLIIyjyRaa	Make a move on her or flirt.|`|eJ4IR5Epaa	Ahh...women can get suckered in to the littlest things. It's the small things that make us smile and give us butterflies...When a guy likes a girl and wants to be with her, he needs to give her like a preview of what it could be like in a relationship with him. Tend to her small needs, make sure she is comfortable in the environment, if she is cold, or thirsty. Ask her what she feels like doing for the remainder of the evening. Open the door for her, brush her hair out of her face. Grab her hand. Seriously, that stuff never fails. In result, you will make her feel safe with you, like you can take care of her and defend her. <br>  Good luck!|`|EeabLB5eaa	Mabey if your talking to her on aim, msn, yahoo messnger, txting, or anything else like that you can tell her she looked really pretty at the movies.|`|jBQdFiXsaa	stick ur fist in her vag, probably...

As the quote would state, Friendship is very delicate as a glass, once it's broken, it can be fixed again, but there will always be cracks.|`|03GQ637Raa	Well all you can do is don't stoop her level and tell the secrets she sold you about her family.  Stay away from her as much as you can.  If you think something you told her about your family might get back to your family, well I would go to the family member(s) you told the secret about and fess up to it.  It will be better if your family knows before your so called friend gets to them first.  Are u still dating your ex-friends brother?  If so, don't confide in him anything important that you don't want to hear later. Don't let her know how upset you are about what she has done, just kick her to the curb.  Know that you will find another real good friend.|`|f2fyXyulaa	Be the good friend in "the long run." Forgive but don't forget! Don't tell her secrets but don't YOU tell her anymore of your secrets either!! Good luck and I hope this helps...trust me...being the good friend pays off in the end :)
AA11085356	Have you tried asking him? Maybe he's waiting for you to say something else.|`|EeabLB5eaa	It sounds like he's trying to annoy you. Unless you like him, don't respond.|`|aTvQAueWaa	I think he likes you!! he is being strange so you could look deep in to him or ask questions about him as you did!!    till you two get closer to each other....|`|HxdqZojpaa	he says that to all the girls. I bet he was busy talking to a girl too.|`|bTCDP3Bzaa	He wants to have sex with you then leave you|`|JxNDTbS4aa	block hiim|`|TiJ9ZISGaa	yeah i do that it is a joke it is like saying hi, but just to a girl. I do that a lot in school with friends it is all fun and games, sorry though if you do like him...|`|wKVrgkPGaa	Probably just trying to act cute.<br>  <br>  Or maybe he's just trying to get your attention.|`|eXiSIaQcaa	don't worrie move on he'll come around|`|ZUwo5imvaa	It means that he likes likes you and trying to you know kinda of get you|`|wgxYJ2Fgaa	lmfaoo ur both boring i hate wen girls dontt talk they neverr lead the convo maybe he thinks ur not into him.talk dickk!|`|G6wCVtiIaa	maybe he just wants to say hi<br>  lol|`|J9sUlpX8aa	What is the problem? If you want to take it further just...do it...if not...block him or ignore him.|`|Ozggv2xLaa	i really get made when sumbody do that but...............im mad ova a stupid thing|`|hzWtMS3zaa	Maybe he wants to get to know you, but he's shy.<br>  You should go beyond the usual "nothing much" and talk about something funny that happened that day. Or ask him what he likes.<br>  He could just be saying hi, but he's probably doing it to start a conversation. Don't be afraid to make that move!|`|c96L56jJaa	dont worry about it until he makes a move|`|BwaHkJ7Taa	My guess is that he's just doing it to do it. On the internet people say to others a lot of stupid things  cus they can
hBmafVYoaa	Wow that's pretty rude isn't it. I wonder why you have such trouble.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	YOU think WE are stupid? lawl|`|AA11085356	Perhaps you wouldn't have such a hard time meeting someone if you didn't judge them before you have even met them.|`|q2POh1dEaa	I'm in the exact same situation, except I'm a guy.<br>  <br>  Dont worry, you're not alone.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	You are looking in the wrong places.<br>  <br>  I think there is actually an abundance of women/men in this country.<br>  <br>  Honey, you've GOT to be picky.  Are you expected to marry an inferior sort and then go through a messy divorce 4 years later?<br>  <br>  I prayed and prayed that God send me a husband.  I was SO lonely.  Then one day, my hubby expressed an interest in spending time with me.  And this man came with the Peace of God in my heart.  24 yrs ago.<br>  <br>  How old are you?  I know a lot of people who met each other in college or grad school.  Sam and I knew each other from the church.  Go to places that nice people go to:  dog walks, pedestrian walking trails, or jogging.  Maybe even a neighbor.  Ask your nice friends if they know someone with your quality standards.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  TX Mom|`|rV1uAtt3aa	Well, I'd have to say I think your attitude may be part of the problem.  If you go out there looking for crap, that's what you'll find.<br>  <br>  I'll give you the same advice I give to everyone who's having a hard time meeting the right person:<br>  <br>  1) Put yourself out there.  Date, date, date.  You may have to kiss a lot of toads, but sooner or later you'll find a winner.<br>  <br>  2) Don't be afraid to try the services (Match.com & EHarmony, for instance.)  These work okay (see #1.) <br>  <br>  3) Join clubs and organizations that do things you love to do, or that support the causes you believe in.  This is a great way to meet like-minded people who may be direct dating potential, or know other like-minded people they can introduce you to.<br>  <br>  4) Tell your friends and family you're looking; let them set you up.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|98WKYtfwaa	I'm in the same boat, i find someone and they turn out to be a complete jerk, the ones that are the nicest are all taken. It's horrible i know, but i've come to realise that the right person will come along sometime, so i'm giving up on dating and concentrating on my life for the time being. <br>  <br>  You're definitely not picky at all, i'm more picky than that! There is alot of guys out there.|`|lveC3ArHaa	Well aren't you a cocky, arrogant, idiot.  You are picky and what makes you so different that all the *crappy* people of the world.  Do you deserve to be respected and considered so highly for no apparent reasons.  How about you stop worrying about other people and focus about yourself.  Maybe if you better yourself you'll meet some better people.  Stop judging.|`|uLHtXibRaa	Join the worldwide club...its ppls values in general that have gone down the toilet..you're literally not gonna find anyone with very high standards morally...or those to match your own..and if you dont want to downgrade yourself staying single is the best option...|`|a88b0f44a1d7abe4bce01e6a248dbc64aa	that is reality|`|xPeIvywdaa	theyre rare, and theyre not everywhere...<br>  <br>  keep looking|`|BbT3DCHvaa	I'm right here|`|o3d3NBVzaa	the guys you want are taken for a reason.<br>  <br>  except me. but I'm talking to somebody else, sorry.<br>  <br>  no, I'm not self-assured. i just know who I am.|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	That's a cold, harsh assessment that will likely p*ss a lot of people off. That being said, you're 100% right.<br>  <br>  What you failed to tell us, and what you possibly refuse to admit to yourself, is that you do encounter smart and slightly insecure guys who can take a joke and make you laugh, but most of them are not attractive enough to satisfy the needs of you, a superficial female.<br>  <br>  What you really want is a gentle giant. A guy who is fit, works out, makes you feel safe when you go out, but who's also got wholesome values, is honest, caring, sensitive, can make you laugh and who's got a certain decent level of maturity. Wake up, this is the real world. That's extremely rare to find, so yes, all the good ones are taken.<br>  <br>  You can preach all day about how you don't want some bulging muscles meathead on steroids, but you know what?? Those guys get laid, like a lot. So they can goof off w/ their buddies, the ones injecting the steroids up their butts, and act like immature little babies, and women will fawn all over them, therefore approving the behavior by ensuring that they get the amount of sex they want.<br>  <br>  Your best bet: find a guy who's got the qualities you want and date him, even if you aren't physically attracted to him yet. Start a workout program together, so he can in good enough shape to have a nice physique. Request he shave whatever areas you like to be smooth and mold one of those "good guys" into someone who's physically hot. Granted, you run the risk of his new look attracting girls hotter than you that were previously out of his league and then he dumps you. However, you're going to have a much easier time getting a guy to change his appearance than his personality.|`|MWjNp6y3aa	How about me and you talk. Send me a message and see if we all still suck. We are not all bad. Some people just have had problems and do things as coping mechanisms to deal with past experiences and trying to barricade themselves from future occurrences of the same type.<br>  <br>  Send me a message. If you have messenger it would be much easier to talk. No I am not trying to pick you up on yahoo answers either. Just figure it might be fun to talk a bit since you seem so frustrated.|`|VelE30y7aa	The best men, are gay or married. Do with what you get.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Someone give her--her cookies and ice cream back!! <br>  Hurry!|`|z5hrgF45aa	If you find one photocopy him atleast 100 times for all of us LOL|`|BmnwsvfOaa	Um maybe cuz u have high standards?<br>  But if thats not it maybe ur choice selection has a trend to it and u try to go after these jackasses over and over.<br>  If that wasnt it no one can hlp you cept maybe Oprah|`|RMGzjECmaa	hmm i am different <br>  <br>  1. exercise 2nd <br>  <br>  2. smart, but fool around alot<br>  <br>  3. always honest<br>  <br>  4. not that cute. :(|`|rtOYamgSaa	"Why can't I find anybody decent? Why are most datable people crappy?"<br>  because you haven't me me|`|UE9e10Avaa	well i was going to help you out and answer the question but, then you just had to assume i was a bunch of crap. so...it's your loss.|`|7mlnPLt4aa	Most people who are datable are people who don't have dates yet. So the majority of single people are those who can't get dates because they are "crappy".|`|DQlZIzAFaa	You're probably not looking in the right places. Hang out in different places and you'll meet different kinds of people.|`|QODJNf1oaa	It sounds like you are making every guy you meet run with your personality. (and i don't even have to meet you to know that how weird.)|`|AA11324847	Because those kinda guys know you won't be with them for long. We're not stupid. Most guys ARE douches, this is a fact. it's a vicious cycle that stems from how BOTH genders treat each other over the years. Girls bounce from guy to guy, therefor guys are adapting. I'm a beautiful person, and I get judged as a molester or some s**t because of how I look. I'm not ugly, yet I come off as something  somehow undesirable, yet underneath I'm the sweetest guy you'll ever know. But I know better than to approach someone who can't understand me let alone relate to me. Quality over quantity for me.|`|5lXouSKAaa	Maybe the right guy hasn't stepped into your life right now.|`|g27LbLQsaa	You might need to give people a chance. Nobodys perfect and people make mistakes. You really do have to take the good with the bad and hope for the best. I only found my partner when I stopped looking- we met in a supermarket (the last place i would expect to meet a guy) so there is still hope for anyone. <br>  Everyone has crappyness about them but its still part of who they are- expecting someone to have zero crappiness is not very realistic and will mean you don't ever meet anyone cause you won't give anyone a chance- that would be a shame. try setting your expectations a little lower then you won't be disappointed, you can only be surprised or impressed. good luck|`|iCATP5Uqaa	I didnt even read your whole question to get it...I didn't ge married til I was 34...may I tell you that  it wAS ok?<br>  <br>  Be you...you will meet someone...I promise|`|zcjff25baa	Hey you seem pretty cool. <br>  You have a positive attitude about yourself and have quite the way with words. I would know because I'm an avid writer and I think you have talent and an imagination.<br>  As for your question, I agree. Most people, especially on here, are really crappy. I hope you find me as 1 out of 10.<br>  Those people who answered your question are perfect examples of bitches. Getting mad at your opinion is wrong.<br>  I think you should try going fishing, in a matter of speaking. Try a few guys and end it if it doesn't work. I'm trying to work on that, but I used to be a new girl a couple of years ago and at first no one liked me. I only just became a somebody here, and some guys are still hesitant to date me.<br>  But anyway, go ahead and try. Feel free to be "picky," because those girls who say you are just picky seem like they have no priorities set, and that will haunt them later in life when they go to find their perfect guy and don't know what to look for or "try on for size."<br>  Feel free to add me to your contacts cuz like I said you seem pretty cool!|`|Ab4HRBFpaa	Hmmm, you sound a little like the girl I've been looking for in these toxic oceans. Ah well, all you can do is be persistent till you find what your looking for. I guess you could give up completely and run the risk of never meeting that guy. I feel like I am stating the obvious, I'm afraid I don't think there is any hidden solution here.|`|9167fa19ace7dcedf3455af90acdd59eaa	Maybe you need to change the way you judge people.  If you have an attitude that everyone is below you, and you are telling us that we're "crappy", you already have an uphill battle.<br>  What interests you?  Then decide where you can go to meet people with similar interests.  <br>  If you think that most people are stupid then I think there is a good chance that you will be spending the rest of your life alone.  If you don't think your attitude needs to change, then get a pet and be happy with tha!|`|wggQRDb2aa	I bet you 9 ot of 10 times you are the Problem!|`|9nmkoJgYaa	Because all the cool people live far apart.|`|XPHdUpDKaa	3rd world countries|`|J9sUlpX8aa	You talk about everyone else being crappy, well step inside.<br>  <br>  You know what, you are right. We ARE all crappy, stupid, ignorant wastes of space. Hold your hands up in front of your eyes. Yes that's right, YOU are one of us. You are a total and utter waste of perfectly good oxygen and I want you to know that the only fish in the sea suitable for you are the ones that will eat you.|`|wgxYJ2Fgaa	i bet 10 out of 10 guys u go for are the ones who think that theyre bad *** and shi* and i didntt even meet u! u pick the "least" able to date guys.garunteed|`|YKkP1wlMaa	It might just be the places. All guys are crappy sweetie. but if you really love someone and they love you then they will change. sometimes you just have to give a longer chance for the guy.<br>  <br>  if that dont work and they are still just as crappy, then dump their butt.|`|rswiEosSaa	Hey I have the same problem. The dating pool is pretty crappy that's no doubt. In my opinion, all the good eating fish are caught and the ones left just can't find one another. Keep fishing and stop being so darn pessimistic.|`|AA11485494	hmm well your kind of being picky or the perfect person isnt there yet .|`|vrfKf5o2aa	the answer is pretty simple. you just havnt found the right guy.<br>  <br>  try looking further. or sit back and wait for him to come to you.|`|3ju1utlhaa	Tell yourself, "okay, he IS out there. He's probably in this room and I don't even know it." :)   <3|`|KLpN10Icaa	Beccause when choosing people to date or partners people too often let their materialism or their superficiality get the best of them.  Its too bad.  some very beautiful people are very ugly on the inside and vice versa|`|wyGbmN9Taa	It seems as though you are very opinionated.  I don't find this particular characteristic very becoming or attractive.  Maybe you should look in the mirror for the answer.|`|TiJ9ZISGaa	when you find a group let me know!|`|VOlFnLbXaa	cuz u ugly as shitt|`|yqXjJFipaa	wow ummm if u rly think that then maybe ur actually the crappy one so thats y u can only get crappy guys.|`|kamZAhTwaa	I feel the same way for women.<br>  <br>  all mess you around<br>  <br>  try going somewhere you love to be.. such as if you love the beach go there, meet some guys who love beach bumming. i don't know.|`|4sYDXYzqaa	ur picky!|`|Y3Tf4JhPaa	Im free.... and normal.  besides the fact that I love to ram candlesticks up my *** and flip over and tell people to blow it out while i sing happy birthday|`|yGfmofHUaa	everybody is crappy, ESPECIALLY YOU. And you wanna do dead guys? I think that's illegal and extremely sick|`|xBir30SDaa	u cant find anyone who meets your 'criteria' because just from reading your question it seems that you have all the negative traits yourself that you dont want in a partner!<br>  <br>  Try chill out a bit love and stop being so mean!|`|IJXLWU0Zaa	What Wonder Woman said is pretty true, in respects to society's moral value these days. What i won't agree on is her defeatist attitude. When things seem their bleakest is when you should fight the hardest. There's always that light at the end of the tunnel that'll make your trials and tribulations that much more worth it. In regards to finding the type of guy you described, I could only suggest some minor things that'll still get you stuck with a bunch of crummy guys. My advice is hang in there, it's obvious you don't want to or intend to give up. We always surround ourselves with what we know/like so it's just a matter of time before you find what's right. That's all I can say really without going into a long rant that would cease to make sense or be related in many different instances though.|`|R7yEdcm8aa	You are one ****** up son of a *****!!!!!!!!!!...You ask for advice then call me and many other people crappy maybe that's why are so lonely!!!!!!!!!!! so go **** your self no one else will.|`|XAkYFP1raa	dont listen to these freaks.....<br>  <br>  look all there is to it is to live life...dont keep "looking" for the men...<br>  becuase trust me u will find a good man at a given time...everyone finds qa person and its never too late to fall in love ..... everything happens for a reason.<br>  dont look for mr perfect because noone is perfect ...not even u or me...<br>  everyone has a certain defect but u learn to live with it becuase you obviously will like that one person for who they r and wat they stand for.....<br>  <br>  crappy ppl exist everywhere and yea there r more in certain areas...so let me just tell u to go out and meet new places to meet new ppl..travel doesnt hav to b far, maybe just an hour or two away.|`|1Akk3hZyaa	maybe your a crappy person and you attract other crappy people?|`|rDrPI3DLaa	well you've probably given your male friend the shaft whos so into you by the way while you pick up on the @ssholes thinking you can change them but @ssholes will always be @ssholes so why dont you look next to you
2yyg1EYhaa	1 to 2 years apart|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I agreed with the first answer.  It really depends on how old you are.|`|CNLpTE2Zaa	maybe you should rephrase that question. =P please|`|jJ152e8Iaa	None!! cuz age does not matter!! yes if a 18 year old is dating someone younger than 18 is somewhat bad because that means the younger one can take advantage of the "adult" one by saying **** like "if you don't buy me this you will be reported since you are 18 and i am 13 (or 16)" but then again if they act their age and probably mature, then it wouldnt matter what age is who. =)<br>  <br>  Hope i helped if so please vote for my answer to be best answer! ty!! <3!|`|zB4AlVICaa	it depends on age, in high school, no more than a year, but by the time your 90, no one cares if your with someone who is 70|`|hhYHGHNsaa	well, when your 13, i suggest that you go out with 13 year olds. its the best when both of you are the same age (when your 13). <br>  hope i helped :)|`|t74P7p2Taa	What?

c1uqy4akaa	wow dont pay attention to the 1st answer. because i dont think u were being bad and your absolutely normal!!! i mean friends even if their going through tough times they can stilll be nice to you and they dont need to be rude. i think what u did was fine. but i think u shud stop apologizing and give her the space she asked for because apologizing only irrates her more.|`|yU2WHyvgaa	Same thing happened to me. i got jealous and now my friend hates me. Hey what i say is, that if they can't forgive you one time then they aren't good friends.|`|lTNcvqyHaa	Hmmm these things happen in life. No you are not crazy.<br>  <br>  Your friend just didn't want you to be her only friend. She probably didn't want to hurt your feelings and did need space.<br>  <br>  Let it go now and move on. You are spending to much time thinking about what happened and trying to over analyze everything. It is good you have a conscience, but don't let it become a hangup.<br>  <br>  Open yourself up to other people and find new friends, never hang off one person - you will always be disappointed.<br>  <br>  When you fall in love with the man of your dreams he will be the only thing and friend that matters. So take heart - go and enjoy yourself not other people.|`|TbYQyxM0aa	You shouldn't feel guilty, just take it as a lesson learned. Whenever a friend or someone you care about asks you to give them space GIVE IT TO THEM. Don't dwell on this, you cannot change history. Just let her be, and if your friendship was strong she will come around.|`|GdjfU5Saaa	it is only normal to feel left out, and insecure over your friend. The only thing a friend should do is help the other friend during rough times. like seriously, who doesn't like to hang out with your friends, even in rough times?|`|3kCQDUUGaa	abnormal &  bad|`|oijAnax4aa	uhm, in my opinion your friend was the one at fault. She should've realized you were jst trying to help her thru the tough times, like best friends do and should. but, as you can't go back and change the past, just try to patch up your friendship again. if it was a good, strong friendship, then it shouldn't end because of this. Jst slowly try to become friends with her again, and if it doesn't work out, then it was never meant to be..... <br>  good luck!|`|CVvYhEfGaa	she's in love with you dumby.

OhoYD9I9aa	You should take a break and just be friends with your gf. Even if you havent physically cheated or dont think you would, you are developing feelings for someone else and it isnt fair to the gf. if it is meant to be you will remain friends and get back together with gf. You should break it off with gf, be honest with her, and then be honest with "the girl". Then just wait and see what happens.|`|AA11841294	Well if you two have been dating this long then u two are meant for e.o the arguing is normal, this girl u THINK is the "girl" she's just there as a just in case person. As in.... just in case u n the Girl u love fight again she'll be there as  "friend" ( quote, unquote) or a botty  call.... trust me...|`|99852dc6e52dbae6a6364e1caac2b8c7aa	damn this question's way too long to pay attention to.|`|CVvYhEfGaa	you and that girl are ment for each other...brake up with your girl. tel that girl, that she needs to forget about loser that guy. and be with someone as sweet as you.<br>  but dont freak out if you start to miss your girl friend. its natural to cling to something that youve held on to for so long. but obviously its time to move on. best of luck hun, maybe you could email me and tell me how everything works out.|`|Ozggv2xLaa	well i only read a paragraph and i think sex|`|oJwFSbX8aa	wow!<br>  that's long story!<br>  but hey just tell the girl to break up with him and het with you=]<br>  hahah thats the best i can tell u<br>  but yeahh? if ur in a LD relation ship whats the point? u cant see her,hold her,kiss her, or any of that like u kno?<br>  so its best if u take a break and take a crck at "the girl"<br>  <br>  later skater!|`|cHM2US6xaa	Shorten that and I will help you. :)|`|mC2dRyuMaa	Well I'm sorry to say but i think you should leave the girl your with now. If all you guys do is argue and barely see each other that's not a very healthy relationship and i know it'll be very hard to get over her but "the girl" seems like a catch. You should tell "the girl" to leave her guy because hes just not the one for her and tell her shes meant to be treated better and tell her how you feel that you can treat her way better then her current bf. Well i wish you the best of luck. Bye.
361cbbdfa98c85b3d1f6eb2c810e33e2aa	mmmmm im in the exact same boat as you.<br>  <br>  trust me, you described my situation perfectly.  i dont know what to tell you or how to make you feel better since i feel the same way, but maybe itll make you feel better to know youre not alone.<br>  <br>  i like to explain it as this:  we are the third wheels.  people only use when they need us if theyre bored.  we're the last resort, the second option.<br>  <br>  telling your friends about this and being open with them won't help.  they wont understand/care.  ive tried.<br>  <br>  i hope it makes you feel better to know at least i care since i care about my situation and feel bad that someone else feels just as bad as me.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	So your friends aren't big on initiating. That's how some people are, and you just got to forgive them for that. It's not so bad coming up with things to do and asking people right? You can't just go around being all disappointed and angry all the time or they won't want to hang out with you at all. If they are disrespectful then by all means say something, but just because they aren't always the one to initiate, that's no reason for a confrontation in my opinion. If you want closer friends, find somebody else because these friends you have now just want to have fun or whatever.|`|yU2WHyvgaa	I had that feeling too. Actually they told me they didn't care and that i waste their time. I know how you feel but if they can't treat you good enough for who you are and listen to your problems then they aren't good friends. SOmetimes it's better to just have someone to talk to. Someone to listen to you. These people don't sound like good advice people. YOu should get one friend who you know will listen to you. And keep the others. But at least you will have someone to talk to and have them just listen to you.<br>  To find more initiating people, go for the quiet ones.the shy ones are usually, at least in my experience, the nicest, and love to listen, and are usually open because they don't have many friends. Which is sad because the quiet ones are usually so nice. Go for it|`|phK29PFKaa	I'm one of those people who does not initiate much in going out or doing stuff mainly because that's who I am. It's very hard for me (and maybe for them) since it's my personality. <br>  <br>  I did initiate talks/conversation (rarely hanging out) before with my former best friend, besides being a good listener and a secret keeper.|`|QeJYadsHaa	I know exactly what you mean. I also am always the one that says "hey do you guys want to go ___ on saturday??" or something.<br>  <br>  and sometimes it feels like they really don't want to hangout with you.<br>  <br>  I'm going through the same problem right now, and what I'm trying to do is be more dependant on myself, and maybe that will help not feeling as bad?<br>  <br>  A lot of people are going to say to get new friends, but even after having theese friends for a long time and thinking that they don't care for you, it is hard to get reliable friends.<br>  <br>  Sometimes we can overly think about theese things and make them seem worse than they really are.<br>  <br>  I know you probably don't want to to hear about my life, but the other day I was talking to my friend (one of whom i dont think cares for me..a best best friend) and I was telling her how my mom doesn't get the fact that getting an F on a homework assignment isn't bad...anyway she didn't seem to care through the whole story so when I was done I said "where you paying attention to what i said?" she said yes and repeated my story. Then I paused and said "....did you care?" and she said "well, i mean, i was listening, i heard what you said.." but never said she cared. and then it was really quiet and now today she seems to pay more attention to me and think about the things i say, ask what I want to do this weekend, blah, blah..<br>  <br>  anyway, the point i'm getting to is I think that your friends could be unaware of your problem, and once you say something like that^^ then they will get the hint that you're not being cared for as much as you want.<br>  <br>  <br>  I really, really hope I helped.|`|USn04b4Paa	i hope that changes for you ..There is a saying watch out for what you wish for cause some times it doesn't turn out what you want .lets say you had a friend that text the sh..t out of you and was always saying lets go here and lets go there ,but you find you have to tell them no allot cause you can't find the time to do the things or there exhausting you with there over friend ship ..then you feel guilty and bla bla bla .You are lucky to have friends that don't over welm you when you got the time they find the time to spend with you
SdP72Ymxaa	You didn't say what the age difference is.  The problem may be that your cousin is closer in age with your sister than he is with you.  If that's not what's going on then maybe he's just trying to impress your sister becuase he has a crush on her, lol.<br>  <br>  Don't ignore your cousin and try to have a good time in spite of what's going on.|`|FmvnC8keaa	No don't ignore him. Just try and talk to him sometime, but don't be a third wheel and follow him and your older sister around all of the time.|`|ee3N1lpQaa	aww

I'm sure she'd be more than happy to explain it to you.|`|4JqwBJTSaa	It's teh blood that rushes to there penis.|`|iAlK1v5caa	lol wat the freak? how do they do that? it just happens lol. do you want to know where babies come from too?|`|ebIwZ0iWaa	he got a ***** cos u made him horny it is wen the blood rushes to the penis and makes it erect this normally happpens wen a male gets aroused
AA12226718	I'd say no because she loves herself too much. BUT!<br>  She is apparently very selfish, so to get back at someone and say "I'll show them how much they'll miss me", it's a possibility.<br>  <br>  I've learned to NEVER take suicidal threats lightly. I had a very good friend of mine (what I thought was) jokingly tell me he was going to kill himself, and that night he did.<br>  Err on the side of caution with her I'd say.... I think your Wife is right.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	From years of experience in dealing with people and suicides, labels on people doesnt mean much as to who will and wont. But one thing I have learned is that anyone out here is quite capable of taking their own life at any given moment. now most professional watch for the silent dispondent types as they never tell anyone what theyre going to do and usually do it wher a the talkers or braggers seldom ever do it. they do it for the attention. There are more complex detailed warning signs which i wont go into here for known reasons, but just because a person ahs a specific label put on them from some Dr doesnt necessarily mean theyre going to act a certain way and vice versa. Just beware of the silent quiet types who are having a tough time in life. There are always exceptions to everything too. Hope this helps|`|iizKx4Bvaa	people ar different. I dont know if she loves her self enough to not want to honor anyone with her presence anymore. I am not saying this is the case, but I dont know her enough to say yes.

I guess there can be extreme cases where perhaps they resort to suicide but I think you would be surprised how many people are capable of suicide with or without being narcissistic which is a personality disorder and not so much a chemical imbalance.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Lacking formal education, but with 5 yrs of experience, I'd say only if it's unintentional.

She's putting herself out there, and rejection is obviously going to bug her, so you truly can't feel guilty because it's unavoidable.  You can, though, let her down in a gentle way.  Let her know that she has a lot of really awesome qualities, but that you just don't feel a connection.  Let her know that you really enjoy her friendship, but that you don't want to take it to a romantic level because of that lack.  She really can't argue or feel as though she's not good enough just because that connection is not shared.|`|AjGaEijmaa	maybe u should just tell her how u really feel. it's better for her to get over u knowing u don't like her than for her to hang on, and u allow it. yeah she may be hurt (to what extent it depends on the girl), but it'll be a lot harder for her if u play it off that u like her or something just cause ur afraid of hurting her. u seem to be young so i'm assuming she is as well. she should move on. <br>  <br>  good luck.  <br>  if u need more insight on this and don't have many responses, feel free to e-mail me at pugmaster00@yahoo.com  <br>  but know the opinions will be coming from a 15 yr old girl.|`|RvyRqnoSaa	Tell her the truth but try to be nice about it.  tell her in person but not around other people.

My son and his fiancee are using a restaurant party room for their reception in May. Just call some of your favorite restaurants and many will have them for you. Best wishes on your engagement!
2o3BHgCCaa	It seems odd they they would offer you money, but with conditions (ie you have to show you are comitted first)<br>  <br>  Just tell them the truth: You need to secure the location with a deposit, but can't afford it right now due to unexpected bills, can they help you?<br>  Failing that can you ask his parents for a little help, it is also nice to get the MOG involved as she can sometimes be left out.|`|BJERgbM5aa	I lived with four older sisters.  I'm the only brother.  And I'm proud to say that I survived the wedding plans/arguments/money problems/dissapointments/ of each sister.  No wedding ever goes smooth.  But some aren't bad.  the ones that aren't bad are the ones paid for by the bride & groom.  Nobody had anything to say about the planning and everything went off pretty well.  As for me, My wife and I went to the city hall, got married, went home and told our parents that we were married, and that was that.  ps.  Cash wedding presents came in the mail for the next 16 months.  Everyother day was like christmas.  the bottom line to all this...It's your wedding, do what you want with your own resources.  Good Luck.|`|4POGapREaa	Selfish & self absorbed.  They buy a lamp & all you're thinking is how that money could be used for you.  Why is it your business what they spend or how or when or where?  It's not your rite of passage to just get whatever you want without earning it.  Why do you feel so entitled to other people's money for YOUR event?  As far as the comment about you leaving your fiance for a rich man . . . apparently your parents don't take you too seriously & they likely know that your interest is money.  It was a jab at you & a pretty funny one.  No wonder you're pissed about it because it hit home.|`|zawmsUO1aa	It's their hard-earned money to spend as they wish - they're not obligated by law to spend a cent on your wedding. <br>  <br>  If you want the wedding to go your way, pay for it yourself.|`|499b2674aceaca4224f1e97ffb73d7f7aa	a wedding is stressful enough as it is, without having to worry about  maybe, maybe not finding the money BUT reading between the lines, it sounds to me as though your parents are happy to help out with the cost of the wedding, but feel that you and probably your husband to be, should prove your good intentions by committing your own money to the project. <br>  <br>  I suggest you have a chat with your intended. find out what, if anything he and his family are willing to contribute, traditionally the groom's family shell out for certain items, then sit down with your parents and discuss things.<br>  <br>  My guess is that their idea was to help out, eg they pay half and you and him pay the other half, not to have to pay for the lot.it only sounds fair, that you 'put your money where your mouth is' so to speak.lol|`|72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	ur not wrong about your parents but then again, they aren't giving you full on support with the wedding - it's a sign they weren't that committed anyway.<br>  <br>  Should have picked this up and relied on yourself.<br>  <br>  if you do have trouble, may be an idea to ask a supporting relative or friend to borrow some from.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|185431bf2d462938a17318fe8510b2c0aa	yes you do have a right to be disappointed especially if you are promised money BUT however you shouldn't have relied on your parents to pay for the wedding, If you cant even afford a 100 deposit how are you meant to pay for a wedding?<br>  <br>  if you are confident enough speak to your parents about the money and if you still feel like there wont be any money coming then re-evaluate the wedding and all its costs and save save save!!!|`|x2mgUMb6aa	look at your birth certificate.<br>  that should point you in right direction.|`|1M90Aoytaa	If your parents promised you the money it is unfair of them to say they dont have it then pay it for a holiday. its always difficult when parents pay for a wedding they feel they have the control over it - it doesnt sound like your parents are being very fair or supportive. Can you take out a loan or put it on a credit card unitl your parents do give you the money or are you worried they will pull out of that to?<br>  <br>  im worried about what you said about leaving him for a rich man??<br>  <br>  i think i would be upset if i was you becasue they are messing you about.|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	i think you have a right to feel however you want<br>  disappointed might be the word<br>  <br>  but i honestly think you need to re-evaluate and perhaps re-plan things<br>  it doesn't look like the money is coming as you thought it would be, that is disappointing BUT you have no place telling them when and how they should give it to you<br>  <br>  your wedding day is about the commitment that you and your partner have for each other. regardless of what your parents might think, do this day with your money and IF they give you money later, that's great<br>  <br>  they might be toy-ing with you<br>  either way, you can't count on the money they's promised and you shouldn't go asking for it. it looks very rude (even if that's not your intent)<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|DFAS6jRRaa	If you cant afford 100 for a deposit than you need to seriously re think how much your spending. Weddings cost thousands - you cant rely on your parents for the money, they said they would give it to you on your wedding day which is fine, think of it as very very generous wedding present and have a much smaller wedding. Personally im appalled by your attitude and going there and demanding the money for the deposit is very rude. Its your wedding and they are contributing. Which means they can deliver the money on there terms, you really should have the deposit already. Delay the wedding until you have saved more for the wedding you clearly want and stop relying on your parents for simple things like the deposit. They may have gotten tax return etc and ran into a bit more money, FOR THEM!<br>  <br>  Get over yourself. Your parents are nice enough to offer to help in the first place.|`|dpk9n2SSaa	What they did is mean--telling you they would give you the money so you made plans and then they changed it all. However, it is their money and they are not pleased about you getting married. My parents hated it when I got married. My husband and I paid for everything ourselves. We did not have a big wedding at all, just what we could afford. You will spend the rest of your life with your husband, not your parents. Get what you can afford and don't worry about how fancy it is. Forgive them and start your new life not holding a grudge. Better to get married and be happy than to fight with your parents over having something too costly or fancy. I wish you the very best.|`|h3NJO9dWaa	It's totally understandable to feel that way. I do, my mom is helping me out and we have a low budget but then she went and bought a huge plasma tv and armoir for it. Hello, that's the cost of the whole reception dinner! <br>  Be grateful for their help and the only thing about it that's not cool is your mom saying comments that you are not commited. Maybe that is the reason they don't want to give you the money until then-they think you will back out. I'd sit down and have a talk and let her know how serious you are.

GE68lOBEaa	Is the house in her sole name? if so bad mistake, however all may not be lost.<br>  It is best that you see a lawyer asap. The law has changed now and even if you are not married, but were living together long enough you can claim payment for part of the house (especially if you can prove that you paid for the house, mortgage payments etc).<br>  <br>  If the law is not on your side, i suggest you force you way in and invite some tramp friends and annoy her so much that she meets you half way. A friend of mine did this, she put her house in her partners name and he wouldn't give her anything when they split. She forced her way in, made s much noise and mess that he decided to negotiate to get her to go.

GBRmOem8aa	Absolutely....<br>  Some people are very mature as teenagers, but as they grow older they find happiness in being immature because they missed out on it their whole lives. Hence being mature then immature.... not vice-versa.|`|Rj0hhZoxaa	Oh sure, you bet it is, and our society is full of examples, some of them so common as to be cliches. Take for example the married man, who upon turning 40 or so, goes out and buys a sports car, takes up with a woman half or less his age, and perhaps even has a very public affair with her. The phrase often used to describe him is "he's in his second childhood." There are plenty of other, less extreme examples, but there are plenty of them. Here's a personal one: I go fishing once a year with four old friends; we go to Mexico; we are all married and do not cheat on our wives, but we do drink too much and do some rather silly, childlike things, like painting one guy's feet and hands red while he was asleep. Harmless fun, but hardly mature.|`|vLZePBDhaa	That is possible. So is it possible for someone never to mature, to be childlike all his or her life. As with many things human, there are lots of possibilities and no one pattern seems to fit all.|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	ok. you can be 45year old and still ne immature. age doesnt matter. for some people maturity happens faster|`|C7mmYq6xaa	*glances over to my dad which is 50 years*<br>  <br>  Yeah.|`|0h80Seksaa	From what I've seen in others that sure seems true. And some days it's true for me even in just that one day. I'll do something very mature then later that same day do something that's pretty juvenile, which I often regret later. I don't know if this is the kind of maturity/immaturity you have in mind, but it's what came to my mind as I tried to answer.<br>  <br>  hilly|`|eWPl2nL0aa	Yes, that is possible. I bet a lot of people have known or at least heard about people like that. I have.<br>  <br>  Vnerd|`|AA11447210	Yeah...the person could've been mature for their age as a teen, but stalled for some reason and not gained any more maturity as they aged...so the older they got, the less mature (for their age) they would appear to be.
2o3BHgCCaa	I think all options put together. Just have a barman serve beer wine and punch, and if they want spirits they can BYO.<br>  Go to TAFE and ask the tutor of the RSA (responsible service of Alcohol) course if they can recommend some new graduates who would be willing to work at a private function. You might be able to hire them for $20p/h or so which wouldn't be to bad for a 6 hour reception...|`|ifgzHzA3aa	I think maybe a combination of a couple options.  Let people know that there will be limited beverages provided and that they may bring alcohol to contribute to the collection.  Then have someone acting as bartender (you can find a friend of a friend who I'm sure would do it for $50 or so) to make the drinks.|`|AA12074269	Make sure you have purchased a license for the hall to serve alcohol (or it will be an EXPENSIVE night). Asking people to pay for drinks is extremely rude and should never be done for a wedding. <br>  <br>  Have jugs of beer, bottles of wine and jugs of soft drink on the tables - forget the spirits completely as its not needed.<br>  <br>  If you plan to have champers that can be pre-poured and handed out on trays by a couple of volunteers. I agree with hiring a couple of RHA grads - great idea|`|rNsCkHEwaa	I don't like the BYO option, or a cash bar.  If you let the guests serve themselves, it will go too quickly.   Either have a dry wedding or have a limited amount of alcohol.   Have some beer, some wine for the toast, and maybe a spiked punch.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Booze does not a wedding make, you will not be less married if you have a sober reception, not to mention you will enjoy your honeymoon more without the hangover. I did not have alcohol available at my wedding for several reasons; not only did the location not allow alcohol on premises but I had guest who were working a twelve step program and didn't want to tempt anyone to do something they would regret and I had my schizophrenic uncle there who shouldn't drink but will if it's available and finally, my wedding was about family and it's not important to my or my husband's family to get buzzed at every celebration.|`|S0iqDSSPaa	Have coolers with a few different beers and wine or punch as you said for free. Have a cash bar. Dollar a drink for mixed drinks. Get a friend to bartend and don't forget the tip jar. Keep the liquor simple. Offer maybe 4 or 5 different mixed drinks and post them on a sign. Just do the most popular. Jack Daniels , rum and vodka. Offer a few mixes.. squirt, coke, 7-up, orange juice and cranberry. Also kegged beer is much cheaper. Get one regular and one light beer. You wouldn't even have a hundred bux in the beer.|`|8c7cc680a9dfdc46cf7a06e1622558bbaa	I would probably either have a dry reception or just supply a keg and maybe some bottles of wine.<br>  <br>  They also have what is called a pony keg which is (I think) half the size of a regular keg (approximately 7 gallons). This will be cheaper than buying a full size keg.<br>  <br>  7 gallons would be enough for 60 people to have almost two 8 oz glasses of beer. Most likely, not all 60 people would drink beer either. I think it would definitely be enough for everyone.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I go with #2.  Get a keg for the beer, and only supply SOME other alcohol.  Figure out if you want people to have mixed drinks or just whine etc?<br>  <br>  My mom had a keg, whine & a bunch of hard liquor.   (I think they dropped $400 + on booze lol)  Mostly everyone drank the beer, and they had a lot of stuff left over (including half a keg).   <br>  <br>  So I would just get what you think people will drink, but don't try to please everyone.   If you don't happen to get whine, and they don't drink beer...well then they can have some of whatever non-alcoholic drink you have.  :P|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	NO to #2.. never let people make their own drinks, it will be messy, and they will overpour, meaning they will be rowdy and the alcohol will disappear quicker.<br>  <br>  how about buy a keg or two ($50 each) behind the bar to be served by a friend, and a few boxes of wine from the store (maybe trader joe's.. it's fairly good and only about $3-4 a bottle)<br>  <br>  and have a cash bar.. but as it implies.. a cash bar.. about $5-8 a drink or so....|`|dpk9n2SSaa	If you must have alcohol at your wedding, make it a cash bar where each guest pays for his/her own drinks. Provide soft drinks at your wedding and don't worry about it.|`|fac67a37f8db05650acc85a39ff5915caa	i would supply, people will remember how good your reception was because they were plastered or not i dont know how yall get down. but definitely have a bartender, some people need to be cut off. also depending on their age they might drink more with no attendant. ;)|`|51jR2Lmlaa	Get 2 kegs, one with light beer one with regular beer and get some of those big boxes of red and white wine. If you have money left over you can get some cheap vodka and make punch.|`|1M90Aoytaa	Some places let you but alcoho land return  any unsued stuff after the night - id personally get someone to serve the alcohol - like set up your own bar, charge by the drink, you might even be able to hire a bar and they will supply the alcohol. My freind had a home-made bar at her birthday - a willing friend got paid a few ￡ to run it for the evening, they got drinks from a supermarket that would let them returned unopend drinks and we were charged a little over cost for the drinks. (remember you will need plenty of glasses or plastic cups - some places allow you to hire them which means you can have glass which isnt as tacky and in the uk places like tesco 'hire' them free you only pay for breakages - if theres somewhere like that - bonus!)|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Option 1 is NEVER an option.<br>  Option 2 isn't legal. You can't have people serve themselves.<br>  Option 3 is common around me. $2 per drink and it's called a "toonie bar" because our $2 coins are called "toonies" BUT this can be considered incredibly rude in some areas.  It depends where you live.<br>  <br>  I'd say maybe you should just skip all alcohol and have a dry wedding.  Actually option one could work if you omit the BYO part.  Just provide beer and wine and some juice/water/tea/coffee/soda (A couple non-alcoholic options).  This is very fair.<br>  <br>  edit: The upside to having a hall is you're not paying $7 per drink for your guests to drink.  But you should NEVER ask your guests to bring their own. That is incredibly rude.  I'd just provide simple beer and wine. If they don't like it then they don't have to drink. That is a much better situation than asking them to provide their own.|`|S3Bd3JIDaa	i would say get a keg and leave it at that...providing liquor gets expensive and doesn't last long when it is free. plus it can lead to some embarrassing moments.<br>  at one wedding i went to the bridesmaids brought some hot damn, apple pucker and after shock and those three big bottles were passed on during the wedding march and didn't make it half way through.|`|1a8f556a514b8f836795e2adfdcd3848aa	we did just beer and wine. I wanted everyone to have a good time but not get drunk.|`|RCdTJ3RHaa	get people to BYO or buy their own there. much easier.|`|XBhFs85xaa	option three for sure it will help also with people being drunk and causing havoc|`|c40GaZOQaa	I'm in the same boat with planning our wedding... not really sure what to do about the booze situation.  We're thinking of going and bottling our own wine and proving a bottle of white and a bottle of red for each table (there are only about 80 people invited, which means about 13 tables) so it's not too pricey and people won't whine about not having anything alcoholic to drink for liquid courage to get on the dance floor (haha).<br>  <br>  I think supplying beer and punch is a good idea too, pretty much covers your bases for the range of booze that people like, plus it's an inexpensive option too (which is always nice!).

It's very lonely having nobody else to turn to. I speak from experience, and I now have many good friends, male and female.|`|OepV9xNMaa	One good way is to live with more then one person(its what i did), you eventually get close with your roommates and before you know it you will have a close group of friends.
faeXRQmcaa	Nope!<br>  <br>  My best advice is to not look for one, she will come when you least expect it. I had my first boyfriend when I was 18.|`|f040b9a985ce599dfd0c5e07f7d2aaa7aa	Let them make big deals of it; take no notice.<br>  <br>  I'm exactly the same. 17 years old. Never had a girlfriend in my life. It's nothing to be worried about at all. Just keep doing what you do, just keep being you and one day you'll find someone.<br>  <br>  The way I see things; I'd rather wait a long time and have a great relationship than just have several small and insignificant relationships. Makes it more special, in my opinion.|`|CVvYhEfGaa	sweetheart, its nothing to worry about. maybe you just havent found "the one" if you want though, go to my page, email me, and maybe we can see where things go from there. =)))<br>  (im being serious)|`|imcZnlVvaa	I agree i'm 16 and I still haven't properly dated anyone either :)|`|pj02ePxAaa	i think it's better to not have one to just have one. sure most people you know have been in a relationship, but that doesn't mean it's meaningful. you're better off to wait until you are ready and find the perfect one. i'm 17 and i've never had a boyfriend. i'd rather wait until guys my age are ready for a mature relationship instead of a fling that is based on lust and sex. good for you! don't give into peer pressure. ?|`|5NBV7i5Gaa	I'm 20 and never had a proper relationship.

I was 17 when I had my first real relationship.  No, it's nothing to be ashamed about.  Granted, it is tough seeing everyone with gf's and bf's and all the while you're just sitting there, but you have to remain strong.  I would just say that there's nobody in that area that's good enough for you.  Some people need relationships to survive, while others have found the way around that (people like you and I).  You're 17.  We're not getting married tomorrow, and pretty much everyone at that age is so fickle with relationships, it's not even funny.  <br>  <br>  Yeah, you'll get those who like to show off their "prizes" and talk about them that way, but just look and see how shallow these things are.  I have a feeling you're looking for a...real and fulfilling relationship.  That, my friend, is something that won't be found in a high school.|`|TIw6w2ZGaa	Believe me, its natural, but that's probably because I too am a 17 year old who's never had a girlfriend. I'm just too mature for my age, I have girls saying I sound like their fathers. I'm not ugly or unpopular, I'm just not a daredevil like everyone else. Just wait it out and hopefully you'll find someone just right for you and you only.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Heck no!  Your life is just beginning at 17.  Yes, everyone does make a big deal of it, but there's also the rest of your life to think about, and it's, if anything, a lot healthier to just focus on living and wait for something to come your way.

If you can lock them up and then maybe he won't find them. Some men can be so weird about stupid things. It sounds like he could be jealous of the sex toys. You are not a bad person and some women like using sex toys. Your husband is the one who has the problem.|`|370e691422f07fe796ab12f350d57094aa	You are a very smart and good wife.He is okay.Some couples in their marriage,use sex toys before,and then they have sex.Some men enjoy see their wives using those toys,to have a better sex drive at all.Good and very interesting question.|`|5lfW4v45aa	Why don't you use them during forplay.  As it is you've been keeping this part of yourself from him.  If you share it he won't have a reason to be jealous.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	No having toys for when your husband is not around does not make you a bad wife.  I'm sure he materbates when you aren't around.|`|ENSGrZAqaa	He might feel threatened, like he isn't enough. Bring it up to him, and if he really is uncomfortable with them, explain to him that even married couples will still masturbate. And using implements to make it easier or more enjoyable is perfectly normal. Like a guy watching porn, it doesn't mean his wife isn't enough.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	You mean he didn't know about them?<br>  <br>  Are you using them alone and hiding it from him?  Then yes, that is wrong.<br>  <br>  Have you ever used them with him?  Try that...<br>  <br>  And what do you mean by "not around"?  Do you mean at work, or away for a few weeks?|`|oGo4ftFMaa	No, you're not a bad wife.<br>  My husband doesn't care about my toys, and understands, and other things etc etc <br>  don't want to give too much info.|`|BzvstX7uaa	Most women have and use sex toys. My boyfriend has no problem with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  The only thing I can suggest is to get him involved somehow.|`|lY2XI8kUaa	no it doesnt make you a bad wife. maybe you two could go buy some together and have him use them on you. that way he feels included.|`|cNdGG1fyaa	NO|`|AA10555331	have him help you. show him ur still wanting him.heck try one of your toys on him..wohoo|`|7hj5pFYJaa	If you know your own body better through the use of these toys then doesn't it mean your shared experiences will ultimately be better? He doesn't have anything to worry about because it's simply masturbation which is perfectly healthy and so many people use them, more than you would think, so if he is truly 'jealous' then he is the one with the problem. You're definately not a bad wife - unless these are replacing him, which by the sounds of it is not the case.|`|yNFsEPVBaa	It seems he meant he would like to be your toys so that you use him for your pleasure as you use your toys. On the other hand I consider him a lucky guy. Women like you, so interested in their own pleasure, are not abundant in my house. If my wife were like you I would love to help her out to accomplish her desires.|`|KCLt3Bpyaa	I think your husband took it as, "oh man, i cannot satisfy my wife in bed, and she has to finish herself off with toys".yeah pretty offensive. <br>  Your husband needs to stop being a mangina...it could be worse....could come home to a cheating wife..not that im saying you would do that....just saying it could be worse.|`|YhBQVmmMaa	tell him it's only when hes not around you just miss him so much and you want it so bad open up talk about it thats always helps
Ybo6HS8Caa	Yes, I would, if for no other reason than to be there for the rest of your family, who may need your support.  I too have family members that are less than great, but family is family.  When it comes right down to it, we need to show respect for the loss of a life, regardless of how it was lived.|`|1lOzRfT1aa	Attend the funeral because it is the last time you'll see his face|`|yPO0fiP4aa	yes i would attend the funeral. family is family. everyone has at least one person like that in their family but be the better person and forgive him. go to his funeral because if you don't you might regret it. but if you do even if you don't feel you should have....what is there to regret? and he was punished enough already for all his mistakes because now he is dead. sorry for the loss : (|`|kGBli717aa	You don't attend a funeral for the person that died, so much as to be there to support those grieving. Granted, he was a mess, but think of his parents and siblings that suffered through all of his antics only to have him kill himself. Go and be supportive.|`|TWsxP46Qaa	family is family,i bet he wasnt an a**hole as a kid,use those memories to keep you going through the day,dont dwell on recent stuff,its a day for keeping the good stuff in mind.|`|S4pY0lBtaa	Dude you have to go, he's family <br>  and no matter what you love him right?<br>  Go listen to the song Leave out all the rest by Linkin Park.|`|AovX1Vp4aa	Yes i would attend the funeral. I really don't have too much of a good response for this but to say I would go. Regret is a hard thing to live with. He may have hurt you but he's family. I lost my grandmother a few months ago and i regret not visiting her in the hospital all the time. I had too much pride and didnt want to give in because we had fought and it lead me to have to live with our last talk being a fight. I know he may have passed so its different, but like i said he's family. And the comfort your heart will have for being there, will hopefully allow you to swallow the hurt that you have inside of you for all he's done to your family. And at least make you the bigger person for looking past all his mistakes, and not being like him and making one of your own hun. I hope you make a good desicion. And im sorry for your loss|`|E5NKN09Zaa	even though i really don't think he deserves it i think you should attend because he is still family and you need to be there for whoever may need you. also to show your support

QP8LdPLeaa	well i believe you have a very narrow view of love. but you are right, other people CAN'T make you happy, you and only you are responsible for your happiness, and i think its very dangerous that some people allow others to have control of their happiness. you live life FOR yourself.<br>  <br>  Not everyone is destined to be with someone, some people prefer to stay away from dating, because they either can't trust it or they dont want all the drama that comes with it, like possible cheating, or manipulation, abuse, controlness or being worried about dishonesty. some people just can't stand it and i really dont blame them especially with the way idiots are making marriages a joke these days.<br>  <br>  i'm 22 years old, will turn 23 a few months, i've NEVER been on a date, never been kissed. i've had men walk up to me, but they have always been the wrong ones and it gets frustratating that one NEVER comes up to you that satisfies you in a warm way. but i'm also at a tugawar about choosing to be with someone or not, because i love my private times but i also want to share my life with someone.<br>  <br>  you mention that when you get out of college, you start your career and then you die. that seems lame, borring and just empty. there are not a dozen billion people on this earth for nothing, i dont see why you dont want to get out and get to know at least......28 of them. you think people dont want to be around you, so of course you isolate yourself and that gives people very LOW chances of getting to know you.  thats your doing.<br>  <br>  YOU are choosing to put yourself in a shell, the only reason it seems like people make a big deal about love and relationships is because thats pretty much whats been happening between humans ever since day one of the human race. i mean its a normal natural thing between human interactions. <br>  <br>  You may not see it now or may  not see it at all, but you still have the future to expeirence, someone may walk into you life and just totally change your life and how you view things. all you can do is wait.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	I think love and acceptance is a needed part of one's life.  Whenever I feel let down I think of the undying love of my parents.  I also think of the love of my childrend and my husband. It sustains us through the difficult periods in our life.  Sure relationships might cause you pain but look at all the joy you get too.  The good outweighs the bad in my opinion.<br>  I felt like dying when my parents passed but the love for my children made it bearable.|`|6cm6MB66aa	Well because we are sexually aroused by the opposite sex and to get into a relation makes it easy to fulfill that aroused feeling  .

Ask God to open the door of the true you. It's taken me 19 years to figure out who I am. I'm still young though. I'm 19 and I'm glad God has shown me my purpose. Pray to God and keep your trust in him. He will guide you my friend.<br>  <br>  Also take a personality test. Answer honestly and find out what you represent. See what careers are relevant for you. And also forgive yourself for whatever you done... That's the first step to loving yourself which is what God wants you to do. Follow the career you love, not because of the paycheck. Stay positive bro!|`|mC2dRyuMaa	I no were your cumming from but what i think you should do is find some one to go out with theyl fall in love with you and itl bring out alot from you theyll help you love yourself it sounds wierd but it worked for me.

I suggest when you get the chance to travel a lot. Go to different places and explore different people. Try the same with skills. Take an art class. Join a sports team. Read books and write them. One day you'll find something you love, but it will come to you. You just have to be open-minded to anything.

f2fyXyulaa	Forgive endlessly!! You will not regret it. You are the better person by doing that. The point of not forgiving is different though.you probably have a different point of extension in forgiving than I would...but for me? When a friend deliberatly ends a friendship between me and another person. By then it's ridiculus...but I would still forgive BUT by then, I would start keeping my distance. But tell the person why. That's important too. Good luck and I hope you make the right descision!!|`|kDCuLPKRaa	i forgive as many times i think it will take the person to change. i dont forgive right away but if they keep at it after the 3rd or 4th time i say im done and they need to change<br>  <br>  I would not forgive if it affects me forever|`|fTpk7ospaa	i forgive them tiwce and if they havent changed by then they will never change and it is time to move on.<br>  i know i cant forgive when a boyfriend cheats because i already tried that one.|`|8P6MmLv0aa	I have a very helpful nature witch sometimes mean that people take advantage of it, I always forgive people for there miss givings and the way some people have treated me in the past.

ibFTUi1taa	I would tell her that, even though she's are a great girl, she's more like a sister. Don't try a relationship out because if it doesn't work out she will be even more heartbroken. <br>  Yes, there is a VERY good chance she will be upset. Tell her that she will find a wonderful guy someday, and that she deserves love and respect. Tell her that you will always be there for her, like a brother. <br>  Also, you may want to say that you are sorry about the whole situation. Your guys' friendship may be a little rocky, at least for a while, but things should patch over. Hopefully she will move on.<br>  Best of luck!|`|cAhtEdeSaa	Tell her how you really feel. She's going to be hurt no doubt. It hurts when someone doesn't love you the same way but its better than telling her you feel the same when you don't. It might effect your guys friendship. She might not talk to you for awhile due to embarassment but if your guys friendship is strong than it won't effect it too much. But good luck.|`|ndyckim0aa	i feel that u should tell the gal honestly about it, in a nice manner. don't hurt her, or else u will lose this friendship. but do think clearly that u really don't have a single feeling for her?|`|CMtybMEqaa	she would be more heart broken if you said yes just to please her and didnt love her :\<br>  It's a difficult situation, but you need to tell her that you love her, but in a brtherly sisterly way. and you need to make sure it is clear that you still want to be friends. maybe talk to one of her friends or a mutual friend that you know would be subtle about the situation and ask them to talk to her. <br>  <br>  How old are you? if your teenagers then give it time and things will soon be back to normal (my mate was 'in love' with his best mate for like a year, but he got through it :))  also she could be confusing loving someone as a friend with romantic love, which is common mistake.<br>  However if your adults the situation is a bit more complicated and you need to face her head on, but stay careing and not closed (tell her how you feel and be honest, but not brutal) :)<br>  <br>  good luck x|`|B1XW834naa	of course she will be heartbroken. But you need to tell her the truth. There might be some awkwardness in the beginning, but if you guys are really friends, she will get over it. The last thing you want to do is tell her that you think of her as your sister. Don't do that. I once told a guy who confessed his love that I didn't want to reciprocate because I thought of him as my brother. This devastated him even further. He later told me that the analogy really hurt him. So I am guessing the sibbling thing does not work. Just tell her you love her as a friend and you want to remain that way.

It's like talking  to a lemon. Shy girls to me lacks personality, passion, character (principles, etc.) and are boring, insecure (wussy), immature and may even be manipulative with very loose morals (which is often is the case).<br>  <br>  At times, I feel like I'm better off dating a blow-up doll; at least they don't complain, make you chase them, expect you to be psychic/a mind-reading expert, expects you to make he first move on everything or make you take her to rip-off restuarants only because they don't want to look cheap<br>  <br>  Hope that clears the matter lol<br>  <br>  No offence if you're the shy type.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|Fu7OK54kaa	It's nice hearing these comments!

AA11150213	I don't believe there is a way to get him without looking mean.<br>  At this point you are just going to have to decide what is more important, your friendship with her, or starting a relationship with him.<br>  <br>  Also, this Jacob guy has let you know he still likes you, even though he has a girlfriend...and  you happen to be friends with her. What makes you think he won't treat you the same way. He is in a way showing you that he doesn't value relationships, this may not matter to you if you don't value them either, but if you do think about that.<br>  If they will do it for you they will do it to you. Meaning if he'll leave his girlfriend for you, or tell you you that he likes you while having a girl friend, once you get together he'll do the same thing to you.
snjdyvlmaa	You have to find the positives and have faith that someone else will come your way.<br>  <br>  Have hope.<br>  <br>  Or you won't survive.|`|F32uPjAraa	You feel depressed don't you? Feeling sad? Sadness is an emotion isn't it? You know that before you have this emotion, you have a feeling, do you not? And before you have that feeling that leads you to this negative emotion, you have a thought, don't you? They are YOUR thoughts aren't they. If you have these thoughts they are yours. You own them. You control your thoughts, do you not? Of course you do. This is what free will means, they are your thoughts, you control them, probably the only thing in this world that we do truly control. So the next time you begin to have this thought that leads to the feeling that leads to this negative emotion. SAY NO! I refuse to think this way. Make a conscious effort and say I am a beautiful creature of light, born in the belly of a star. I deserve to be here. And you do deserve to be here, in this existence, in this life. Be objective, instead of subjective. Your thoughts create how you feel. You can change how you feel by changing the words that you use, and most importantly, by changing your thoughts to something more positive. You mind is amazing. And you can trick it. Even if you feel a bit down, put a smile on your face, and hold there for a while. Your unconscious mind will think, oh your smiling you must be happy. And guess what? You will begin to feel happy.<br>  Don't worry be happy.|`|d5duruQaaa	takes time, i don't know how that feels but i think that you need to decide to move on.

CBa9G4j4aa	They are trying to make sure they are doing it right. They want to make sure they aren't hurting you and make sure you are enjoying it. It's not a bad thing it's a good thing so I don't think you should think it's weird. They are doing it for the benefit of you.|`|AA11447210	To make sure you like what they are doing. A lot of women won't say that they don't like something, so some guys ask.

xA1fdVimaa	i agree with Babeheart.  a soulmate isn't necessarily the one you're meant to spend the rest of your life with.  a soulmate is, most times, just someone who's meant to be in your life (because they "compliment" who you are with their own way of thinking ... which tends to be much like yours).  additionally, the connection you have with a soulmate is mutual (both of you share it).<br>  <br>  as for waiting ... ask yourself this, if they were truly your romantic soulmate, would they make you wait?  better yet, would they hurt you?  don't put your life on hold for anyone (your soulmate would understand that ... and if not, then they aren't your soulmate to begin with).|`|T4iv2QZvaa	i would date other people depending on what the personal reason are|`|42MOquw8aa	no i dont think i would wait. i know im kinda selfish and everything but life is too short to wait for someone else. you may be waiting a long time and before you know it life is over|`|AA11447210	A soulmate is simply someone we have a strong connection to, almost immediately. Sometimes it's as if they know our thoughts and dreams w/o us verbalizing them...as if we knew each other in a previous life.<br>  <br>  Soulmates come in all types though. They can be our age, much younger or much older...same sex, or different sex. They are often not romantic partners or lovers for us, but they can sometimes be. Some people meet none in a lifetime, others may meet many.

Ig0nRZlgaa	Ok, first of all take a deep breath. You are in panic mode and reading WAY too much into this.<br>  <br>  No biggie- when you see her on Monday let her know you called her. DO NOT start second guessing whether you made a mistake by calling her. You didn't blow anything, ok. But you will if you start questioning why she didnt return your call, asking her what happened, etc, etc.<br>  <br>  If she says something about her comment that she would see you on Monday, maybe she knew she would not be available to talk to you until then. So if she brings it up then just tell her you weren't sure what she meant, but you wanted to talk to her, so you called! Don't aplogize for that silly.<br>  <br>  Be cool, you are alright, just don't ask a bunch of stupid questions and start doubting yourself.<br>  <br>  One other thing, let's say by chance she purposely didn't return your call...really-SO WHAT...don't feel rejected--you did what you wanted to do based on how you felt, if she was not open to taking your call--again--so what... you called her because YOU wanted too, you don't make excuses for it just because she didn't respond the way you wanted her too. <br>  <br>  My guess, she may have said, see you on Monday because maybe she wasn't expecting you to call at all...so--if she said see you on Monday, then SHE wouldn't feel rejected by giving you her number and then you didn't call.<br>  <br>  Ok, there--- we have ruled out every case scenerio there is-so put your mind at ease and look forward to seeing her on Monday and let her know you called--simple.|`|uLHtXibRaa	i would only give a man my number if i wanted some diy..lol...no seriously ... it would be because i really fancy him..but i find if i give them my number usually they dont call as they are not sure of a woman who is forward enough to give a man her number..|`|GpitqYxcaa	Never call the girl again the next day.

9iCyQzIBaa	Just talk to him. Voice all of your fears and concerns, because I'm pretty sure that he is just as disappointed that he cannot satisfy you. He is probably scared to bring it up though, as he does not feel confident enough about his problem and maybe thinks he is just being stupid. If you love him, let him know you're there for him and try to let him know that you know how he feels.<br>  If all of this is too much to just blurt out to him, write him a letter for him to read, so you can get down all your emotions.<br>  I hope this makes you stronger as a couple|`|RsDAGnBhaa	Sounds like you probably have it right about how he feels insecure or something, i think the best thing to do is just ask him exactly (nicely though) what you're asking us. Tell him how it makes you feel, and you guys can talk it through. I wouldn't ask about the what's your problem thing but ask him why don't you get turned on by this anymore. that kind of thing...<br>  <br>  hope this helps =/ good luck >-<|`|KR8RUXLSaa	oh mai dog....<br>  <br>  <br>  well, i would say you shouldn't have dated but it was 8 months.<br>  <br>  <br>  he is just going to have to get over it on his own time love, im sorry. i do know there is (from what i am hearing from you) NOTHING that you are doing wrong. keep it up, if after i would say a year MAX he is the same you are going to have to tell him to GTFO it and move on.|`|Ftz9UWPEaa	when a girl stops being that special one in a guy's mind, it may change his enthusiasm of doing something with you.<br>  if it is bc of the break, it may never be the same again.<br>  ..or maybe he got another main squeeze, and doesnt want u to find out.|`|ysXC0zClaa	I think it might be a little of an insecurity issue. You should let him know that sex with him is great (even if it isn't). I know that it may seem like a lie, but sometimes guys just need that confidence boost to get their mojo back.|`|UIOE8MiMaa	tell him he is well endowed|`|Kdr9CRbqaa	well yea!!! he's unhappy b/c you had sex with someone else!!! since u were his first and only, he probably thought that u were gonna marry him or something. u made a mistake, by seeing some1 duing ur break.|`|NIUkYdL2aa	A lot of boys are like this.<br>  <br>  I know this is not helpful. But I would feel the same
rAS9n75laa	most likely she thinks what you like is pretty awesome and so she wants to be pretty awesome by liking the same pretty awesome music you like.<br>  if that made any sense.<br>  but maybe you should talk to her about her copying your taste in music.<br>  <br>  and by the way.<br>  the offspring are amazing(:<br>  <br>  anywayss..sorry to get off-topic there for a second.<br>  i think you should talk to her. because if you just stop liking a band because of her, she will only keep following what you do.|`|NrgpG9NWaa	Tell her kind of jokingly about what you just said. Say it lightly as to not get her cheesed off at you or hurt her feelings. Ask her why she does it and tell her it is OK to like her own music. You could also tell her like, "oh I hate when people copy me. It's my pet peeve! You know, like if you like a band and then they like a band and then you don't and they don't" and play it out like you are not saying she does it. Just that it bugs you without mentioning her name or hinting she does it or anything..<br>  Hope this helps :]|`|03GNhNcsaa	dont show her your mp3.<br>  dont talk about music.<br>  it's the only way for her to stop checking what you like, & then copying it.|`|AA10265178	Well, you could just try asking her about it, and she what she thinks. That's where i would start off. After all, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery :]
OWOtKZmgaa	well it looks innocent enough and if she says that's all that went on you will have to go with it and forgive her ,she looks worth keeping on as a wife with fantastic breasts ,if you love her enough be the big guy and tell her never mind lets carry on and next time go with her to san diego|`|7aoHmM4baa	i did t watch the whole video<br>  but i think that if the guy sniffing is not you<br>  then that s like cheating to me<br>  because it looks like bad to me,he is sniffing her sexually,and i bet she s getting ticklish maybe even Honey<br>  the way he looks ,it s so discus-ting to me<br>  she is a whore ,am sorry<br>  ad to do that for $100 only it s just way too cheap|`|Kl9zdMfpaa	LOL WTF!|`|YzObEmUqaa	Slave for her???|`|156d702b8908052bd0660d07c6803996aa	Are you trying to advertise your site or something? Obviously that women did nothing wrong! If she is your wife she is gorgeous.|`|zHJufZTcaa	She just sat there... What the hell are you barkin about?????|`|CtPaUvoBaa	yea ok you need to get a life she is not your wife|`|k7SOs18raa	what????????????|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	mate she is right she did no wrong .. but for money next give her more .. money ..|`|mYmR5cX5aa	Maybe you need to drop to your knees more and kiss her feet. <br>  Get over it. Nothing wrong there.
TBZK5q78aa	Stay focused on your career and keep your focus on God. Stop beguiling yourself with deception.|`|XasLRQnXaa	rofl
HzF1Frdoaa	well bed buddies aren't ever really a good idea. but if he is your bed buddy he must be attracted to you in some way. maybe he some feelings for you too all you can do is tell him|`|7LGvDKrbaa	Here's the question, can you continue your relationship with him knowing how you feel?<br>  If you want to know how he feels about you, ask.  If it's meant to be it will.  If he doesn't want a relationship with you, other than the physical, than you'll have to make a decision whether you can still be involved with him or break it off.  You'll never know if he cares about you, unless you ask.|`|LQvvZ5EHaa	yes, that is quite a problem.<br>  assuming that you started this with him because neither of you wanted anything serious, just a bit of fun, then yeah.. :/<br>  if you have developed feelings for him, he might have for you too.<br>  you should talk to him.<br>  if he feels the same, maybe it is time or something more (:|`|mi3Udvroaa	They're great, but if you have feelings for him, it all turns to **** in a matter of a second.|`|0iGvVjOjaa	ooo your in a pickle :)|`|v398Qalyaa	i'm not that surprised you have started having feelings, as that can easily happen with someone you are getting very close physically, you need to decide whether you can cope with being him knowing how you feel|`|yE1VgFhiaa	good idea but you cant get attached...|`|3c65e16c42860ec54a50b9aa3312f2a2aa	just make clear what your position is (that you have feelings for him) and hear him out.<br>  <br>  or you could lie to yourself and keep the good times rollin...|`|yfYOScbqaa	I think **** buddies.  Even the very phrase is disgusting.  And is very very very very WRONG indeed.  **** buddies indeed!!! I THINK NOT!!!!|`|dc5bTUtmaa	Generally not good idea but we are all here to live n' learn|`|NAqfPvmHaa	not anymore since you now have feelings. seems like a good idea but its not!!!people always end up getting hurt!
PK5Elowdaa	you sound like my girl. We havent spoken to each other in two weeks. No emails, no text, no phone calls. I feel the way you feel and she feels the way you feel....If they don't call me, I won't call them. But in all honesty I wish she would call me. Your bf must be feeling the same way. Call him. Guys are more stubborn when it comes to admitting or giving in. Just call him.|`|7Y72LqiPaa	Yea he likes you , just confront him with it , he may deny it but say " wanna have lunch tommorow " than yea.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|faeXRQmcaa	I think I had left you a comment already. If there was no real reason to break up, then go ahead, give it another try. But let him earn it too!!
0w8baV4raa	Man, teenage girls don't know what THEY want in general (no offense ladies).  Truth is just because someone is in there early 20's/late teens doesn't mean they know what they want in or out of the opposite sex.  <br>  <br>  Just keep looking and BE yourself and you will find who/what your looking for.  Be patient and don't stress, we all figure it out eventually.|`|CUMdhfKzaa	The common interest is sex.  It's easy.  Just pull your pants down.|`|CNSGz12zaa	18yr old penis.|`|N4GreuqEaa	depends how old the girl is. if girl is younger.. i guess someone who can protect her. (not like brother or dad...)<br>  <br>  girls like guy who takes her side. if she talks **** about this girl guy must agreed with her. <br>  <br>  list goes on and on..<br>  <br>  basically who treats her like princess..but not over doing it..u need to play hard to get sometimes..<br>  <br>  -looks if this is the right answer you are lookin for..|`|5a5dc884e7f99069d222e3d48ffb3bbcaa	if you still believe anything anything can still happens|`|xJCc01oRaa	Are you trying to be a professional pedophile?|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	lol just the fact that they are older than them really. i think thats it|`|gUhcMAutaa	music is a good place to start. everyone likes music and even if you have completely different taste then it is still a good conversation starter. girls also love to talk about celebrity gossip and shopping. You can even research these subjects. dogs are defiantly a common interest in all humans i mean everyone loves dogs! good luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|yX7CGrcyaa	just for guys to be guys and not just about sex and not to have dirty thooughts about them and to just be like a decent guy....|`|XAkYFP1raa	maybe the freedom they may sense knowing the guy is older and legally can do more than her..plus guys their age r very immature|`|43yT9vnEaa	Maybe their personality!? Idk...|`|nHC6hV7Haa	their looks or personality or being more sophisticated|`|2h4eetekaa	whatever I happen to be talking about at the time|`|fRWNOoRfaa	road head

YTKFVzJmaa	Some people want to be treated like royalty by others without having to put any effort towards anyone else. I've wondered the same thing myself, and i've just came to that conclusion. They want to be liked without doing anything.<br>  <br>  just ignore those people, and don't let them get to you.|`|cgQrQSvDaa	u again? lmao geez|`|1oDGVsouaa	shes just a hater
hWmpITbYaa	stop smoking<br>  it's bad for you|`|cgQrQSvDaa	um i dont see anything wrong with her honestly maybe she just likes you I dont know. I'd say just to add her on your top friends and leave it be what does it really matter anyways?.
D3As94Dnaa	Find some new friends. And if you'r a shy person join some out of school activites or after school activites you'r sure to make friends. I know you have tried talking to them but just... tell them that you'r going to give them a last chance and make it clear to them that if they blow it then thats it your out for good no matter what. Talk to the one that isn't involved in it all, she might be feeling the same. Try to fix it and as a last resort just blank them.Show them what there doing to you find some new friends and show them off infront of them. Just try not to get to upset about it all xxxx Best of luck :)|`|Xx2Iu5FXaa	There are some people that have a certain mentality when it comes to friends: they only talk to people that they've known for a long time, and when someone new comes along, they try to talk only about things that you wouldn't understand.<br>  <br>  These people are assholes. They will make you alienate all your true friends. Ditch them before they ditch you.|`|3c65e16c42860ec54a50b9aa3312f2a2aa	give yourself some value, do something valuable (not just with money but something interesting) , and show them that you're worth being friends with|`|yoS4cAszaa	Hang out with the other friend.
MFPBz9dHaa	Geez this situation seems just like one i was in 2 years ago with my best friend. She meets like loads of random people online an begins to trust them an then acts as though they are best friends. but at the same time she slowly ditches you for her cyber friends even though they live on the other side of the world. :\ <br>  <br>  i totally get were your coming from being annoyed with her for all ways making you feel as though you come second to her new "Best friends". trust me the worse thing you could do especially as shes got a boyfriend who's she is most likely never met an lives in another country is fall out with her. as from my own experience your friend needs you there to support her just in case something happens.<br>  <br>  well i hope i helped; an trust me it might be really annoying just hearing her going on about her " boyfriend" but shes your friend so your meant to stick by her no matter what even when she makes the wrong decisions.|`|dTPg4uYzaa	yes that is really annoying if she wants to be stuck on the computer with these people that shes never met then let her type away her life and you go out in the real world and have fun with new friends who are really here not through a screen. have fun ignore her like shes been ignoring you with this pretend boyfriend|`|NrgpG9NWaa	Yes, definitely. Your friend should respect you far more than her Internet buddies. For one thing, they may not be who they say and they could even be predators.<br>  But, if your friend's MySpace friend addiction doesn't seem to be able to be stopped, just ignore it.|`|Xx2Iu5FXaa	Absolutely. It sounds like she's abandoning you for people she doesn't even really know. You should confront her about it.|`|4AKiarekaa	i have a whole bunch of friends from all over the world tht i met on myspace.  i tlk to them like ive known them for a while too .. for ur question i dnt think u should rele be tht annoyed.. i mean yea. if she tlks about them as much as u said then ok just tell her tht u dnt want to hear about it .. shes ur best friend yea itll hurt but she;ll get over it.<br>  as for the boyfriend thing... are you serious?? u rele dnt have to be worried about tht cuz its not likely tht theyd last tht long.. and dnt call her a retard.. shes telling u things and expects you to listen because she thinks u wont judge her.. ur her friend be there for her no matter what.. anyways just tell her be like "______ im sorry but i really dont want to hear it, ok good for you that ur meeting new people and stuff but you dont have to tell me everything"<br>  <br>  <br>  idk.. thts what i would say..<br>  hope i helped.. <br>  good luck with everything<br>  and calm down  dnt lose ur patience over tht|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Well for starters, of COURSE she's going to get angry if you tell her she's being retarded. She's supposed to be your friend. Try being a little nicer about it; maybe you'll get a better response. <br>  <br>  It's understandable that you're getting annoyed at her; it's like she'd rather hang out with people on her computer than spend time with you. I'm sure she doesn't mean to be like that and she's not intending to hurt you. And I know that it can be frustrating when she sees these people as "real friends"...but try to understand that to her, they ARE real friends. Which, is exactly why you don't need to lose your temper with her. <br>  <br>  Try e-mailing her a letter; tell her how it makes you feel. Don't attack her or tell her she's being stupid - remember, this is something that she enjoys. Just tell her that it hurts your feelings that she'd rather spend time in her room on her computer than hang out with you, and that she has a whole world of people right here in front of her that want to spend time with her, too...that kind of thing. I think you'll probably have a lot more success with this if you are nice to her rather than insulting. <br>  <br>  If all else fails, you could try talking to her parents about it; tell them your concerns. If she literally wants to spend ALL her time on the computer then that's not healthy, and if she tells all her personal information to any random person online, then clearly that's dangerous. Just be sure that if you take that route you do it out of concern, NOT spite.|`|24384049d41e4b2011721c3e776b0ff4aa	Yes and no<br>  I understand you feel like she is abandoning you but really if you think she is your friend you should accept her for who she is.|`|03GNhNcsaa	ugh. i'd say the same thing.<br>  she never actually met them in real life.<br>  how can you be best friends with them? <br>  the friends shes with could be different in the real world.<br>  <br>  if she keeps continuing this, ignore her.<br>  there is no way i would stick around, listening to her.|`|zz2inOIZaa	no its not justified<br>  <br>  this is who she is and if you are her best friend, then you should accept her for who she is, not judge her<br>  <br>  even if you think it sounds absurd, you need to back her up, because if you don't, then who will?|`|cgQrQSvDaa	yes you have every right to be that way. I'd just have a heart to heart talk with her if I was you and let her know how that makes you feel. if she does not change it then do the same back.|`|50yKK90Haa	yes i think it is, but at the same time i think your friend might have something else that is bothering her and that's why she is finding comfort in people that do not know her personally and will never meet her. so i do think you do need to encourage her to talk 2 you more and try and get her to go out instead of spending too much time on the computer. however do let her know that you want for once to talk about something else and talk about something that is goin on in your life as well. ps: please make sure she keeps safe while she is online dont let her go all the way somewhere to see some guy.
dyHKPlgZaa	oh my days no.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	No, definitely not fat. Shame she is so ugly. (Bang goes your ego!)|`|SyKr4Yjnaa	No.|`|TvMiwKjEaa	Wow.

You would have to have seriously disordered thinking to think that she was fat! She is what I would call skinny.|`|syKIxX45aa	No way, she is not fat and she is not to slim.|`|9PbyjAEXaa	no. if she is fat then i am 2. and that would really suck|`|f1608bdb212d4515049acab36a99ef38aa	no not fat not chubby ok|`|lqrducoqaa	she is skinny<br>  <br>  !!!!!!<br>  <br>  nice shape!!<br>  <br>  she shouldnt worry at all|`|n0rJH0l6aa	Would I hell!

iLRE4yF3aa	well acting uncomfortable is a death sentence to the party. SOOO walk up to him. tap him on the shoulder, smile really big and go "oh my goodness! hi! it's been such a long time! how've you been???" <br>  <br>  if you make it sound like things are totally natural, you can have one short conversation and leave it at that. you can walk away after and not talk to him for the rest of the night, and not worry about the awkwardness. if you confront the situation head-on, it won't be as uncomfortable as if you don't say anything.|`|NrgpG9NWaa	Just be cool and be yourself. Say hey, what's up. It's been a while! And all that. Just small talk and see where it goes
F2rI3Juaaa	Next time don't kick her while she's down to make yourself feel better!|`|MQCT1FXjaa	i would guess shes pregnant.|`|0V2RsODOaa	i dont think you did anything wrong...<br>  Maybe she was just in a bad mood.|`|ItleV9qeaa	first off u should be sex story writer cuz that had some good details don't worry tho no wood on this of the keyboard<br>  anyway shes probably looking to u to know that if anything happens to her (like getting pregnant) she can know u'll do whatever it takes to support her through anything|`|AA11401294	she is emotional. hormones.|`|9YM0whxLaa	she sounds like a *****<br>  break up with her before you loose a child over this crap<br>  im sorry to say that but its true<br>  you dont want that in your life.|`|6627NijZaa	mayb she wants a kid and u just said u didnt want 1|`|38c2RtAQaa	i think you need a new girl,your too old,which could mean shes not too experienced,also u dont wanna be in ya local jail doing a 5 year join now do u|`|eR2rrcJcaa	so what? u guys r teens? u r going through puberty, this stuff happens. and besides, u r too young 2 have sex so u shouldn't be doing it!|`|awG5zHmxaa	she thinks ur thinking of her as a sex toy that's why shes so mad|`|Lz0GV8SXaa	Dude, you ever think maybe she just started her rag?|`|5YEKmHqyaa	Ok as far as the sex thing goes.  After having sex for a while a girl will get dry if you don't make her wet or use lube or anything.<br>  <br>  The abortion thing....she probably got mad because if she were to get pregnant, you didnt ask what she would want.  You would just want to get rid of it right away.  Girls are really sensitive to these kind of things when it comes to getting pregnant and abortions.  I have a friend whose had 3 and the last time her bf said he wanted an abortion, she got really angry, because he didnt even ask how she felt.<br>  <br>  Most likely you all aren't even ready to have a baby, but she probably thought you were being insensitive to her feelings.  Let her know you are sorry for how you had said it and you were only trying to help.<br>  <br>  Just be there for her and definately take precaution when it comes to protection that way nothing does really happen and you both don't have to make a decision like that.  Just genuinely apologize and i'm sure she'll come around.|`|GpitqYxcaa	Usually the first time for a girl hurts. You need to slow it down. As you have sex more often she will expand down there to make room. Over time the pain will go away and she wont feel pain during sex. About the abortion thing, apologize to her about it. Tell her you would go along with what she wants because the baby IS inside her, and not you.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  -Billy|`|Iptnp2zCaa	Ok.  First off, if you're going at it like animals the first time and she tells you that you're hurting her, why would you go down that road again?  If you're having sex and she doesn't like it hard, then take it easy, always.  No matter how you're feeling.<br>  <br>  So you're in the doghouse with the rough sex and you bring up a topic that you know you disagree on.  Abortion?  Holy crap kid!!!  She's asking how you'll support her if she gets pregnant (obviously to see how you feel) and you tell her basically that you won't honor her wishes because you're against abortion.  Which is fine believe me, but WHY would you bring this up when you know she's already pissed?<br>  <br>  give her some time, say you're sorry and for God's sake kid, when she's already mad, don't poke the bear with another hot topic.  <br>  <br>  And take it easy on the sex.  And use condom's.

She might not be used to it all. Remember you're stretching a muscle so it is going to hurt. Maybe she feel uncomfortable or shy and that is the reason she does not really want to talk about it. Try not to embarrass her with sex questions. I know she loves you but sometimes that topic can be a little taboo. I think the reason she can't respond to the questions you would like her to answer is because she is shy and also she might be offended that you can't read her reaction and determine what she feels and the topics she does not want to discuss. Remember she is 16 and getting pregnant should be one of her worst fears. I think she wants you to understand how she feels about pregnancy/ abortion but she can't explain it in words. Therefore she pulls away to clarify her discomfort. I don't think she is mad at you. I think she would prefer if you can "read in between the lines" of her actions and stop asking her weird questions. Honestly, if you ask her those questions too Much, she won't take it like you are caring for her, she is going to think you are a freak that only thinks of your sex life.|`|eyGAytOTaa	It seems to me that she wants to have a baby and she wanted to test you by talking about abortion to see what would be your reaction. You said that you will be very careful to not get her pregnant instead of saying well if you got pregnant we will take care of the baby. Thats why she probably got mad at you that you dont seem to be supportive. OR she is pregnant and she cant tell you. She thought that if she could get an abortion then you would be ok with it but after realizing that you are against abortion so now she is frustrated. If you found out, you might tell her mother and that you want to keep the baby instead of silently get her an abortion. <br>  <br>  You need to talk to her and ask her whats bothering her. You will support her every decision to see her happy. if there is any challenge then you can both resolve it together. <br>  <br>  Thats just my opinion. I hope she is all right.|`|n0rJH0l6aa	I'd feel the same as she did, she sounds like a sensitive soul like me so I think I understand how she feels.<br>  <br>  I'd feel like you were pestering me about it because you wanted me to carry on having sex, not because you were worried about me. She probably felt bad because she had to stop you anyway.<br>  <br>  Also if you had said "I'm going to have to make sure I don't get you pregnant because I don't like the idea of an abortion." when I was asking you what you WOULD do it would upset me. As to me that would mean you wouldn't take me in the instance of it happening which would make me feel unloved and make me feel like you didn't care about me enough to look after me at a time like that.<br>  <br>  She'll probably get over it by the time you see her again, so I wouldn't bring it up. Just try and empathise with her next time she asks something like that, girls minds work in very different ways.|`|tBpN4Sfxaa	she sounds a bit moody..... ask her if she is pregnant. it might freak her out a little bit, but both of you would be affected if she was. you need to calmly ask her if she is pregnant and if she doesnt know, then ask her if she would like you to go with her to get a test. be supportive. and be sweet about it. good luck love.|`|x8LBArCuaa	Alright so my girlfriend came over today,<br>  <br>  (great)<br>  <br>  and whenever she comes over we can't keep our hands off each other.<br>  <br>  (double great) <br>  <br>  Were rolling all over each other kissing then we have sex while trying to watch a movie.<br>  <br>  (it’s “we’re” and what’s up with the dual entertainment of sex and a movie?) <br>  <br>  Other then that we were having a really cute time everything was going awesome. <br>  <br>  (what exactly constitutes as a good time?)<br>  <br>  Then we have sex a second time and its going really well,<br>  <br>  (apparently)<br>  <br>   then she starts saying owe.<br>  <br>  (so now it’s time to pull out, kiss her down below and go!)<br>  <br>  So I think I'm hurting her <br>  <br>  (Einstein) <br>  <br>  so I slow it down and we started doing it romantically.<br>  <br>  (pain included = romantically painful l= still painful) <br>  <br>  Then all of sudden she seemed back in the mood so I started going harder again.<br>  <br>  (she’s a fighter)<br>   <br>  Then she just gave up on me,<br>  <br>  (even Ferrari’s catch flats my friend, however I see you have a particularly errored way in describing a women inability to bear the pain of a man dry penis. I am willing to bet you have never asked her to describe to you this singular trauma.) <br>  <br>  and she said I'm sorry I feel really bad but I can't do it anymore its hurting me now.<br>  <br>  ( “hurting me now” as for -o- lets say the last 15 mins. To apologize for something so fundamental, it’s like apologizing for passing gas, burping and so on, it’s ridiculous and also, it’s indicative of both her youth and also strong feeling for you)<br>  <br>  So I tell her its fine no problem,<br>  <br>  (oh how nice of you) <br>  <br>  I'm never going to get mad if she does that I don't care we were going at it for a while anyway.<br>  <br>  (sadly spell check doesn’t correct grammar)<br>  <br>   I just started holding onto her and I wanted to talk about it she obviously didn't and seemed really tired.<br>  <br>  (so next time try maybe accepting the obvious, women deal with a lot from us men, and many times silently so. I feel you two need to sit down and try learning one another more. This way you don’t find yourself going too far and also this way she doesn’t allow you to go too far. You understand? If she is unwilling to communicate her feelings more or if you aren’t able to understand her more this relationship I feel is on borrowed time for you my friend)<br>  <br>  So I tried to slowly ask her about it, once she kind of brushed off the question. Then I made the mistake of asking her again and she got a little mad.<br>  <br>  (you have to more than realize the signs you have to acknowledge them. Also try changing bad subject rather than lingering on them)<br>  <br>  And for some reason I brought up something she said earlier about getting an abortion. And if I would bring her in so her mom would never know. And I told her well I'm going to have to make sure I don't get you pregnant because I don't like the idea of an abortion<br>  <br>  (ok this sounds juicy and young, please do not play with the lives of our future my friend, use your rubber duckies! I beg of you my friend.<br>  <br>  So now shes really pissed at me... I don't get it though. <br>  <br>  (You have to remain agreeable with certain types of relationship. Considering the type where you can be 100 percent disagreeable does not exist I would advise you to try remaining agreeable as much as possible. Her emotions seem high as well; do you two have something baking in the oven? Is so this would explain your entire dilemma)<br>  <br>  She use to tell me that every time she tried to care about me I pushed her away. And I changed I opened up to her more and now its almost like shes pushing me away.<br>  <br>  <br>  (you know what they say, “like dirt they flirt, like gold they’re cold” the truth is you and her are young and so the two of you  have found yourselves in an evolving relationship which in this case, if you are not mindful,  can mean hurt. I am not able to afford to you much more time so please, I will continue on)  <br>   <br>  I don't understand what I did wrong<br>  <br>  (It is not what you did it is what you are doing, fall back and learn the possible mother of your child, she is worth this much, trust me, I am older and have played these games as well son. Also learn her with joy, and patients, again, she may be the bearer of what’s yours) <br>  <br>  <br>   though I'm just trying to care, <br>  <br>  (continue)<br>  <br>  and she left before we had dinner or anything. Were teenagers by the way. <br>  <br>  (as you say… duh!)<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm a little bit older and shes 16.<br>  <br>  Can anyone help me out?<br>  <br>  (some idealist say God can help you, while others believe that everything you ever needed in life, you had at ten to 12 years of age. I however know this; what you eat today you’ll pay for tomorrow. Be careful not to act on childish fears and raw emotions. You have a lot now and more later, all of which you will have to tend to and deal with. In the moment your life seems too much to deal; remember you are an American, we have it wonderful my friend. That is all. But of course, you already knew this.<br>  Omar ri aN|`|yc4iZszpaa	Dude you didnt do anything wrong, it sounds to me as if you were showing empathy, women appreciate this, However i do feel shes pregnant and shes 16 there could be a number of emotions shes feeling right now. Perhaps guilt, confusion, I would just let her gather her thoughts she'll give you the whole explanation once she figures it out herself. in the meantime just let her know you are there if she wants to talk and you'll support anything she chooses. But for now let her get her emotions together, She ins't ready to talk about it yet.|`|YEfZQkL6aa	if i was in your girlfriends position it would be that she is scared of one getting pregnant and two walking out on here.<br>  <br>  yu should talk to her about it. you need to be sensitive about the situation as well don't just throw it in her face. cause she will avoid you at all means necessary.|`|XToj1wNQaa	Maybe its a personal problem shes to embaressed to talk about. Just give it alittle while before you bring it up again. (shes not pregnat is she?) When My sis was pregnat, she said it hurt her to have sex.|`|x47fcvqXaa	for one thing mayeb she wanted a little romance and u kinda ruined that during sex when u started goin faster again...duh..i dont know why she's bein a ***** about the abortion thing..who knows..,aybe she has some problems u dont know about|`|ghWyyXYXaa	well 1st how old are u really...and 2nd she probably got a other guy on the side or she is tried of taking it all fun and games...she is probably ready for a serious relationship|`|vrfKf5o2aa	sounds to me like she had an abortion before. and when u said u dont like the idea of them she would feel bad.|`|7t0yzFVxaa	relax|`|omBvkpUXaa	ewww i dont know im only twelve about to be thirteen. are u too a little young|`|c4BxyRzbaa	you've got your self in to a real mess here. first check your state laws to see if you can take her in to get an abortion with out her parents permission.

AA11401294	Don't marry her!|`|qfTgWDj2aa	I think that they are probably just trying to get a rise out of you. Think about it, who in their right mind would laugh about getting herpes from someone... no one!  It sounds like they are just being typical guys. They are probably friends of the guy that she cheated on you with and now they just want to rub it in your face. Just keep an eye on her and you might wanna change your number and be very picky about who gets it. Her too|`|EdDLydH7aa	ohhhh....if you are getting phone calls from these guys, why would they waste their time, it sounds like she cheated and they want to rub it in your face so she must have mentioned that she had a bf....i know it hurts b/c you want to marry her, but if she can't stay committed while you are just dating don't think she's going to change b/c you get married, i know it hurts but unless you want to always wonder, which i think you know deep down inside that she did cheat on you, again, then you are going to be in a world of hurt and why would you do that to yourself. No one deserves to be cheated on and you sound like a nice guy, you have  her another chance and she did it again, or so the guys calling you told you, so why do that to yourself? Good luck and the pain goes away eventually.|`|Ex9uDEBQaa	I would confront her about it. Not in an accusitory manor. Openly ask her abou the phone calls. If she's an honest person, she'll tell you. If she isn't the honest type, then it will be impossible to know.<br>  <br>  How did you discover she cheated on you the first time? Did you question her about it? Did she deny it? If she ever denied it to you, then who's to say she wouldn't do it again and deny it? If she told you, unchallenged, that she got drunk and cheated, then I would believe her answer this time as well. <br>  <br>  Basically, this is all a matter of how much you trust her. As for "what would I do?" Hmm...I don't forgive cheaters because i believe there is no excuse. Even being extremely drunk, you still can say no. I've been there. I said no. No, I wouldn't even be in this predicament because I would have curbed her the first time she did it. <br>  <br>  Trust is a nacessity for a relationship. If there isn't trust, you have nothing but lies. A lie is a mask. So ask yourself, do you want to be with someone masking who they really are or with someone who shows you who they truely are?
CDzStUPUaa	These guys are full of it (if you know what I mean).  If the guy had herpes would he seriously be laughing about it?  I think not.  Someone is conspiring to break you two up.  Let your girl in on what's going on.  Be sure to tell her you don't believe any of this bull.  Then,  get on with your life with your girl and forget about these jerks.
tvjOMZNRaa	What you need to do is give him some space. Clearly he needs to be able to process whats happening. If you smother him he will only react by pushing you away. Give him a few days or a week to think it all over. Be patient and when things have cooled down a bit try to talk to him again. If he still tries to ignore you or doesn't accept your apology as hard as it may be to take this information in it's possible that he might feel that there is no way to repair the friendship. Depending on what it is you guys got into and argument over and how frequent these arguments are he might just be sick of it. Sometimes things happen for a reason and you should move on from it. But i do suggest giving him time first to think things over. You also have to think of yourself. Also ask yourself Is this friendship really worth it?|`|5SgXN39daa	What exactly did you fight about?  Was it really worth fighting about?  Was it really worth him getting so mad about?  And does he have any anger issues that you know of?<br>  <br>  Okay, so try talking to someone close to him, and find out why he's so mad.  They might be able to get through to him, whereas he has shut you out completely.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and if things don't work, I'm really sorry.|`|T0QRgAKbaa	well honestly, its really hard to understand whats going on since we dont know what you did that made him mad. But if what you did was truely a mistake, and you are truely sorry then, you should confront him cause everyone makes mistkes|`|K8OjmMUAaa	If you lied to him and that's what he's angry about, then he might not trust that you're sincere about it. If it happened recently he may still be angry about it, too. Just give him some time to cool off...and try again in a week or two. If you've lost his trust then you are going to have to earn it back, and that can take a long time depending on the person. Just don't give up on him, if you friendship means that much. And if he needs to tell you how he feels, then let him.|`|T0pkW783aa	Write him a letter and mail it.  It is his choice if he accepts your apology or not.  Give him time to see if things change.  He must be very upset about the fight or it wouldn't have gotten this far.  Give him the space he needs to think about it and if you are lucky, maybe he will consider being your friend again.  If not, learn from this mistake and try not to do it again.  I am sorry about this.  Fingers crossed that things will get better.|`|cfkgnbCNaa	Give him some time to get over it. There is no way you can force someone to be your friend. Give it a week. Then go to his house. Face to Face. Don't call, don't text, just confront him face to face. Talk to him, tell him you made a mistake and are asking for forgivness. <br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, maybe you won't ever have him as a friend again, take it as a lesson learned, and be more careful with the friends you have.|`|cgQrQSvDaa	if you have already tried many times and he still is being that way i dont think you can do anything to change the way he feels im sorry. Its hard to losse a good friend it really is but everything happens for a reason and if he cant forgive you and forget then just move on and leave him be. Maybe he will come around on his own at some point anyways.|`|24384049d41e4b2011721c3e776b0ff4aa	They day time heals all. so just give him some time and if them he can't forgive you then maybe maybe he wasn't a true friend because a friend would eventually forgive you.|`|S4gKPOBOaa	find a new friend.|`|8CL8o8K0aa	Just leave it alone.  From what you have said you have tried to make peace.  He do not want you as his friend, that's his loss. Time will take care of everything.  If he was a true friend nothing would come between you both.  Move on with your life.  There are many more acquaintances you can make.  There are many more friends you can find.|`|Zso0PxIcaa	well saying sorry over and over is NOT going to help sweetie! u need to give him space that always works for me and all my friends besides sometimes its good not to talk to him for a little while!!!!|`|dc7IyPVKaa	just give him time and space. obviously, what you told him, he didn't want to hear, and it didn't make the situation any better. show him that u are still sorry, but don't force him to forgive u.|`|3c65e16c42860ec54a50b9aa3312f2a2aa	you could always try to talk to people that knows your friend, and maybe they can mediate the situation|`|OMPSzNUdaa	it might depend on what happened.|`|leU4QY9iaa	Get one of your friends to explain to him that you're really sorry and you mean it :)|`|nVcPB89gaa	if you apologize, then leave him, he is free to stay with you or not. if he is interested in your friendship, he will come back when he calm down|`|P7me6hptaa	Just leave him
Q1PczvzKaa	You need to tell your parents and coach and call the police.You could have been killed!|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	You should have called the police right away. They would have handled this assault. You are very lucky your could have been scarred for life. However, you know that you did something to get someone back and also went to the party..what were you thinking? The only person you ever have to prove anything to is yourself...in order to not be victim and/or a drama queen, it is really important to never get sucked into such bad energy and allow yourself to get involved in such a situation. Begin by accepting and loving yourself, and be sensible.|`|QSUg9vNLaa	Press charges honey<br>  you could get some $$$$$|`|TJiGs8S4aa	That was an assault.  Boiling water, especially on head, hands or feet, can significantly hurt you.  You should go to the police right away.  It doesn't matter if you are not sure if she did it - this is serious!  And you need to let the police do their job - they can interview witnesses, and investigate. The threat needs to be reported to the police - it should have been reported as soon as it happened!!!!  Please take this seriously!  This girl is a freaking nut job - and the fact that she cares more about herself than the team, and than about anybody else's personal safety or well being, is frightening.  Your parents need to know!  CALL THEM.  And you should probably go and get emergency treatment, so that your condition can be logged and monitored.  You SHOULD be making a big deal of this - calmly, but methodically.  Otherwise, you are sanctioning a personal assault - and there will be more.  The police need to know, and the school needs to know. I am serious.|`|cgQrQSvDaa	omg! thats awful that someone did that to you im sorry that happend to you but im glad your ok it could have been really bad. I;d say tell your parents when they come back and do something about it no one should get away with that thats just wrong.|`|zukzHDWlaa	omg im so sorry,that must have hurt terribly<br>  <br>  well first off do your parents know?<br>  if so they maybe they should call Jane's parents and they should all get together and talk,and if that doesn't help then you should most def call the police and tell your coach what happend|`|SJtu58moaa	i thought you threw jane into a fire!!!!|`|CoPpecGKaa	OMFG. that B****!! u need to tell your parents and than the police!! geesh. i am so srry. that must have hurt like hell. i am pretty sure somebody saw who threw the water. ask around

Especially if he feels reasonably certain that he won't get caught.

If it's because you know they are living wrong, change friends. Most people your age are influenced more by the latest pop star than by Jesus—but of course that isn't the whole story.<br>    After all, pop stars come and go, and what was popular last year is outdated this year. But Jesus never changes, and that's why it's far better to build our lives on Him instead of on the shifting sands of the latest fad. As the Bible says, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever" (Hebrews 13:8). And in my experience, many young people today are discovering this and committing their lives to Jesus.<br>   I also want to remind you who Jesus really is. He is the Son of God, the One God sent from heaven to save us from our sins. No one else can do this for us; in fact, the latest pop craze is likely to turn us away from God, or even mock Him and His will for our lives. But when we know Christ, we know where we came from, and why we are here, and where we are going when we die. He also guides and helps us as we face life's decisions.<br>    I pray 4 you, and I encourage you to commit your life to Christ and learn to follow Him instead of the crowd. Jesus warned, "Wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it" (Matthew 7:13). May you not make that mistake, but may you put your faith in Christ and learn to follow Him every day. <br>  <br>  David<br>  believer_in_jesus37421@yahoo.com
Z0lbrnHpaa	She's in the wrong, not you. She's just now realizing it and that's why she feels bad. I don't think you should worry about it at all. If she wants to discuss it and work things out, she should come to you.

I have had a lot of friends loose good guys simply because the relationship was not as it was when they first started going out.<br>  <br>  Really look at the relationship you are in. If you are happy and you love him, whats the problem? Maybe you are just bored, and if that is the case, find things to do with each other. On the other hand, if you are miserable, then move on.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	its done, if you two cant be honest about how you feel and be open then there isnt nothing left in the relationship, just wasting time, if you dont have the same plans in life and cant enjoy each other now and things have changed talk about it and see if its not to late, if things arent going to change about his attitude than move one with your life. and wish him well.|`|yIGVOqXdaa	If you are dating and you already feel this way then by all means stop wasting your time and move on till you find the person that you feel you can grow old with. If you are married on the other hand, you may both need to talk about this and make the marriage work.<br>  Good luck!|`|h9v7SQNlaa	...when you feel it in your heart! Don't try to drag on a relationship that you just arent feeling anymore. Maybe sometime apart will be the only way you will know for sure, if you are meant to be. They say...when you let something go (for a good while) and it comes back to you...it was meant to be! If it doesnt come back...it wasnt meant to be.|`|40dUfARwaa	well go with your heart.....if you don't see him that way anymore talk to him about it.<br>  you just have to tell him the truth and the reason why.|`|jMLa696Taa	If you don't feel like loving him anymore or you don't even love him anymore at all.  Don't punish yourself because he loves you.  Later on..you will regret.|`|THvfGib9aa	when he gets out the butter knife.|`|bDWDZ63Iaa	huh?|`|ghWyyXYXaa	well test him first see if he loves you by taking you to your favorite restaurant. or to the movies...if you really want to see if he loves u still go out and party with your friends and turn off her phone...cause he is going to call pro. to see where you at. but if he don't. then just tell him straight up. im getting sick of this relationship.|`|qlFYLSwoaa	that's tough but I'd say dump him when there is no spark any more...like it sounds like it is now|`|iO4YHFavaa	When there is no love anymore:) Simple
TvMiwKjEaa	If I get an erection then I put my hand in my pocket lol...|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	Never heard of that before - maybe he's trying to see how far he can stretch his legs before his crotch rips.|`|KRNaKdpgaa	Nah <br>  <br>  He's just trying to take up as much room as possible in an alpha male like manner<br>  <br>  It's totally primitive behaviour that he will probably be oblivious to.<br>  <br>  If you were spreading your legs it would be a totally different matter lol|`|ZzyEhSB1aa	No it doesn't mean this. You have clearly relaxed him so much that he feels a little bit of flatulence about to arrive LOL!!!!|`|BsK3u5p3aa	dont seem like he tryin to hide it. it seem like he want you to kno he hard... or either he juss learned a new exercise... GET THOSE THIGHS TIGHTER!!! lol|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	Spreading his legs wouldn't hide this...|`|EXM1nHNFaa	hmn. well giving you think such a thing of that action ill assume youre a little younger. (no offense)<br>  <br>  He is probably hinting at Oral sex. <br>  <br>  Google the definition if you are unfamiliar.|`|smvFVN7haa	I Know I Am Not A Guy , But When I Talk To Guys About This , They Either Put Their Hand In Their Pocket, Like Close Their Legs .. Kinda To Hide 'it', Lol... But Guys Do All Sorts Of Things Hard To Tell !! :)|`|0BpEHfq9aa	not necessarily his sacks proberly sticking to his legs lmao!
CDzStUPUaa	You're doing the right thing.  You can't continue to chase her or wait for her to make up her mind.  Since she's the one who seems all confused,  I'd wait for her to  make the first move.  Meanwhile, get on with your life as best you can.  If you're meant to be,  it'll happen.  I wish you lots of luck .... hang in there .... sooner or later she'll realize she's losing a good thing.|`|N2BAdOXEaa	I don't believe this will have little influence on your relationship. Sorry for your troubles, but it takes two to have a relationship. One cannot on their own fix what is wrong with one or over come anothers short comings. Give her the space, and look at your choices, then if it comes down to it, move on.|`|OF7ZHq19aa	If you ignore her for too long it will just drive her away|`|faeXRQmcaa	No, its better if you send her a text, then disappear for a few days. You can also talk to her over the phone, after talking for some minutes tell her you got to go, that you will call her back, and then do so the next day. Try to show her that you are fine, and the fact that you disappear will make work! I am a women, and I wonder when my ex does not call me, and he eventually does!.|`|Q5MZ36x8aa	I think ignoring her can only hurt the relationship with her, I know this from my own expierences, if want to get her back you cant win her back by not talkin to her.|`|mefxIQP9aa	No, it won't help you get her back if you ignore her.|`|q2POh1dEaa	a month? don't completely ignore her.  talk to her a little then stop, to spark her interest and keep her hooked.<br>  <br>  if you all-out ignore her she will accept it as rejection and find someone else.
nL3tIuAcaa	I cannot give up any side, I think both my families are important cuz we wouldn't existed without my parents and we wouldn't kept our lives go on without our own family.|`|vUypopU8aa	your family|`|H9k65Ve0aa	Both are of equal importance, while the family you make for yourself will take first priority.|`|D7JZPxDzaa	i think that its irrelevant if you make it for yourself, because once somebody falls under the category of "family" then become equally important as the rest of your family.|`|0xTBYmdGaa	both i couldn't choose between the family that brought me into this world and made me who i am or the family me and my partner have made together, were all one big family.|`|CceiP7q5aa	the family you make for yourself defo|`|9uZAluGhaa	your family|`|6e3e13dad52401635f135a72ce217f23aa	I guess both are important, it depends on how you will managed it.
cgQrQSvDaa	I dont know because im not a guy but at 23 you should have a job and your own place and car and no you should not date high school girls anymore its kind of ilegal.|`|vUypopU8aa	aww im sorry,<br>  listen to music and go drinking with your friends<br>  there :)|`|RcmdFIyyaa	Look at old people, and appreciate that you're not middle-aged<br>  Act confident, you wil start to feel confident too.<br>  Get a job that has easy hours, good pay, and that you enjoy.<br>  Appreciate what life has to offer.<br>  <br>  TOP TIP - Act like Gordon Brown doesn't exist.|`|1oDGVsouaa	u prolly just can't get outta dat certain age
rJgrwIodaa	Because 100000 girls have a crush on *insert celebrity*.  Who has a crush on those 100000 girls?  It's like money.  Very few people are wealthy.  The wealthy have all the money.  It's not evenly spread around.  People who want to date are like people who want to be rich.  You'll never be satisfied because you're only thinking about the things you don't have.|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	Idk! Some people just like bein' single... but you can still have crushes :D|`|SzubaKbuaa	We're single cause <br>  <br>  A) Most crushes remain a secret<br>  B) People are shy and fear rejection<br>  C) We want what we can't have...therefore, we focus on those who don't actually like us back :( <br>  D) Men suck <-- ok I'm kidding on that one ;)|`|5U7ZwKhXaa	cause ppl are shy DUH|`|F2SzRXfXaa	oh wow<br>  yush it doo ;)|`|YgGi07Rpaa	what? that made no sense...|`|KRJ7h8MYaa	I'm not lying, I don't have a crush on anyone right now. It doesn't really bother me, because I know that dating right now has some potential emotional repercussions which I don't want to go through at this point in my life. I'm having enough trouble trying to decide my career as it is!!<br>  <br>  You are assuming that everyone has a crush on somebody. However, a few possibilities arise which would not allow these crushes to materialize:<br>  <br>  1) Everyone has a crush on somebody, but two people have a crush on one person, and then that "one person" has a crush one somebody else.<br>  <br>  2) You haven't stated that everyone has a crush on EACH OTHER. Just on somebody. This goes somewhat hand in hand with 1).<br>  <br>  3) People might have crushes on someone, but might not be confident to act upon it, might not be looking for a relationship at their current life stage, etc, etc.<br>  <br>  4) The reality is, not everybody has a crush on anyone. You stated your question in such a manner as if to say that this is the reality, but it isn't. <br>  <br>  Isn't it funny that it is the single people who seem to be the best catches, and yet, they remain with nobody? LOL.|`|n0rJH0l6aa	Thats because people who "crush" dont usually let the other person know.<br>  <br>  And just because someone has a crush on you, doesn't mean you'd like them too.|`|zPVftEmKaa	I don't think anyone likes me :{
nOFvdF9yaa	You should feel proud of that! But that's not the end of the story! You must be frank with your "best guy friend" & should tell him intelligently. I don't want a break down among you all. It's normal for a special type of girl to be mad at someone. It's your part to keep the harmony in relationship or in friendship. Apply your conscience, the way you understood the problem; otherwise you wouldn't come here with such question, right? You seem to be honest, that's the nice of you. Thanks.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	No, put yourself in her shoes.<br>  Your boyfriend just slept over with two chicks.<br>  i think you'd be worried, paranoid, pissed, and a whole variety of different emotions. just let her be mad, and in time she'll get over it. but don't let it happen again -you're jeapordizing your guy friends relationship|`|dfuRWfvpaa	try and explain to his girlfriend what happened. if she doesnt listen to you, what do you care? are you friends with her? that could make a big difference.|`|ZNe6B9TQaa	If you all are in high school, then she shouldn't be mad.  It's not like the relationship is going anywhere.  But otherwise, I could easily see why it would make her angry.  Even if nothing did happen, sleepovers with other girls is a big boundary that isn't often crossed without cheating.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could try telling her?  Talk your bffl into telling her nothing happened, too.|`|3Y6oROG4aa	oh so shes like jelous? its normal she will get over it......i mean if yall didnt do nothing then i wouldnt worry....|`|0uEn9xC4aa	put yourself in her position, i would be pretty pissed off too if my bf slept over at a girl's house, even if they are best friends. but just ignore her for now.|`|TJ2EfH7oaa	uh....yeah...quit having "sleep overs" with her boyfriend !<br>  <br>  How old are you?  Did the look of inpropriety never enter your mind?<br>  <br>  Reverse the situation, and see how you'd feel: You have a boyfriend, and he sleeps-over with 2 girls...but "nothing happened"...how would you feel?|`|RN2beDTdaa	this is a sign of pure greed and jealousy. i wouldn't listen to her. and if she doesn't trust her boyfriend telling her that nothing did happen and you two are just friends, then that's her problem. the only thing you should worry about is the guy being mad at you. (x hope i helped! good luck!|`|Y66oUW5qaa	she is most likely jealous with you. just apologize for the sake of not upsetting her anymore and try to explain what actually went on, which is nothing. it's not gonna be a such a problem to you anymore then. you've apologized anyway.|`|K3oLisRBaa	damm of course shes going to be mad you slept over her boyfriends house that has jealousy written all over it..just give her time to cool off and explain to her dat u n him are just friends, but in the mean time stop sleeping over her boyfriends house.|`|4Mb1mFORaa	its because u guys are in high school and too young and stupid to get past blind jealousy.<br>  <br>  her boyfriend slept over another girl's house. it's so simple to see, how can you not see this?|`|ArKT9O7Maa	Have all your friends ignore her.<br>  Play mental warfare.  Women hate it.  But they are masters of it...  It's really confusing...|`|AlJ557gHaa	ignore her. she's just jealous because she thinks that something happened.  it will blow over.|`|3fEfuPWOaa	You are a very stupid little girl.|`|VhBOFmIWaa	Explain to his girlfriend that nothing happened, and if she doesn't care, tell her to shove it. Ask your friend to talk to his girlfriend also. If you need help with this kind of stuff, look for posters around your school for advice hotlines!|`|MzUKeCThaa	i would be upset to...<br>  <br>  have you and you friend explain to her that nothing happened that's really all you can do.|`|aZ9qBM4Haa	Maybe she is jealous because she couldn't spend the night with her boyfriend. Just try to explain to her that you and him are just friends and nothing more.|`|2Sq76xdoaa	You should tell your friend to talk to his gf. Also talk to her yourself, see why she is upset.|`|dIqhwihGaa	Just talk to her and explain nothing happened and apologize if you made her mad.|`|slrzaZO6aa	you know what u did and what u didnt do, so chill. let her think whatever she wants, because u know that nothing happened
VRYTB1eSaa	the same reason friends ditch people for girls. in my opinion it is probably because you have been friends for a long time, and it feels like mostly the same thing every time you see each other. with a boyfriend/girlfriend, it is different, because every time is different and really exciting. once she has been going out for a long time it should slow down and she will probably stop ditching you.|`|lqOC4hbiaa	People are blinded by love. When your friend's boyfriend belittles you, she is probably too afraid to defend you because she wants this boy to like her. It is also possible, however, that she does not see what he's doing as being mean. Maybe she simply views this as only teasing? In either case, your best bet is to talk to your friend one-on-one about how you are feeling. Get everything out in the open. If the situation continues, I would suggest distancing yourself from the both of them. If they are hurting you, it's best for you to spend less time with them. Hope I helped! Good luck!|`|I3Ywzvwcaa	Its because she knows that you will always be there for her and she only has one shot with this guy so she is going to be with him for as long as she has. you gotta tell her how you feel and not back down to her. your better than what shes giving you and when her boyfriend breaks up with her she will come to you and you will be there for her no matte what. don't tell her you told her so. <br>  (girls that ditch their friends for guys that call their friend names are fags. WHAT HAPPENED TO STICKING UP FOR YOUR FRIENDS!)<br>  good luck! (;|`|5SgXN39daa	That's her problem.  I have some friends who are ditching me a lot for a 'better crowd' that I absolutely can't stand.  Maybe he calls you names because you spend time with your friend that he can't have.  The best I have to say is to weather out the storm (is that the right phrase?) and wait to see if things get any better.  If they don't, try confronting your friend to see what the problem is.|`|elpCWmSFaa	well that sucks..  but its because when a girl gets a bf, he becomes close to her and she prefers having private time with him, and wants 2 keep him happy so if he dosnt want the bestfriend around, than the girl will choose him cuz she knows she has you as a best friend when she needs u, but she could loose her boyfriend if she doesnt pay enough attention 2 him.|`|zhqnL2jPaa	It's the magic entrance that boys have over girls. Some can get a girl to do anything. Obviously your friend is desperate for this guy who treates her like dirt. If you have expressed your feelings towards her, and hse still ignores you . THen i say leave that girl to get hurt, because you already tried . When he breaks up with her then she will come running bck to you. Thats when you can say I told you so . And decide for yourself if you want to take her back. You cant blame her though , its hormones. Hope I helped .|`|GFARlBTJaa	its not that she is trying to, its just that girls get wrapped up in their guys and they dont focus much other then how she feels around him. Unfortunately thats how things are.|`|AwMoNJC2aa	Some people are not who they say they are basically.<br>  <br>  Your friend is probably a slut or a future slut.<br>  <br>  Get a new friend|`|NuPwR75Jaa	Friends that ditch other friends for lads are bitches ..

Tja1NM78aa	Yeah, a couple. Really not into girls but when my mates and I get drunk we've messed about a bit, mainly cos they're secretly raging horny lesbians and just want to see you naked ;) It's never been serious and we just laugh about it afterwards when we're all hung over.<br>  They've never slept with other girls but generally give themselves to guys really willingly.<br>  Hmm...maybe you should talk to her about it and ask her. Why do you think you did it? Maybe you're also a lesbian deep down? <br>  Sorry, seriously though my friends do it all the time (I mean the kissing, not the sex) but only do it with really close friends and would never hit on female strangers, cos they're straight - they're just really curious and being immature.<br>  But I think you might be the other way inclined...|`|n0rJH0l6aa	I kissed a girl once so a guy would give me money for a drink. It wasn't some weird prostitute type thing. I didn't see it as weird and I really wanted another drink. Things you do while you're drunk arn't really important. Although I don't think I would ever have sex with one of my friends even whilst drunk. Maybe you should think about your sexuality.
maTLfzi8aa	You must tell your friend about that.Otherwise if you let your friend on with it she could get pregnant and you would say why didnt i tell her.If you want to be a good friend then tell her.If she says like you are crazy or lieing just say as a warning and atleast you gave her the heads up about the guy,So tell her|`|mefxIQP9aa	He probably has an STD already.

0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Men, especially soldiers, need exercise and fresh air. If he says he's only clearing his mind. He is. He also probably doesn't like the 'stuck in the house' feeling.<br>  <br>  When I retired from the Armed Forces, I had to be outside. I felt that I was suffocating indoors. I had to sleep with windows open and I needed physical activity, everyday. I eventually settled down and became more reasonably domesticated ;-)<br>  <br>  You can avoid taking it personally when you see it this way. He needs to do this, and that keeps him stable. Focus on how he is when he returns. Is he happy? More content? More awake? It shows that he takes care of himself, and it is healthier in the long run for doing so.<br>  <br>  You might ask (weather permitting of course) if he would consider you all going out for a walk together. Not always, but sometimes. See how he responds to that idea.<br>  <br>  As he is soon to be deployed, he probably has a lot of things on his mind. That is not an easy place to be in, emotionally or psychologically. See if he would be willing to share his thoughts on that subject.|`|jTtNE6dmaa	You want him to stay physically with you every minute of the day, and if he want to go out somewhere you take it personally?  Seriously?  <br>  <br>  What he is doing is no different than taking a walk around the block.  You are being way too controlling and smothering.  Maybe you have separation anxiety left over from childhood.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	its his way of getting away from the things in iraq,,,just understand it ... he needs it now ..its call time out .. even he dose not understand it .. but when he comes back he will be a new man .. you will see ..|`|mYmR5cX5aa	He is giving himself a timeout to think about things. Most men need to get out at some point for some space. If he is just spending some time walking around Home Depot, consider yourself lucky. He will not be getting into trouble there. <br>  <br>  Talk to him regarding some help with your 4 mo. old and explain that you want to spend time with him before he leaves for Iraq. Understand that he may be worried about the situation he will be getting into over there. The base chaplin or counsellor is there to help.|`|PAA4uWPuaa	Yes because going to 7-11 can really ruin a marriage. In fact I bet it ranks in the top 10 reasons for divorce. <br>  Based on this question I can't possibly see why he needs to get out of the house, he should be dying to sit and listen to you whine 24/7. <br>  <br>  Some people just need a break and need to walk around.|`|k7SOs18raa	honey have you ever thought about the possibility that this man is depressed..he just had a baby, he is leaving you guys to go to iraq soon....i mean this is alot to take in....be understanding|`|AIJlijkSaa	he should definetly stay home more if he is leaving soon, but he could also be overwhelmed with the new baby and all. talk to him.|`|Kl9zdMfpaa	He is cheating on you and he is spending time with his girlfriend before he leaves.

Trying to get away from his nagging wife|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Maybe he just wants some time alone to think about things.|`|e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	OK, here goes:<br>  <br>  The house is like a prison to a man.  It's a place cut off from the world, all by itself on a tiny island.  When a guy is home he is not a part of the world.  If a guy sits home all day, his whole world is the house.  While this is nice some times for the guy, like sitting home on Sunday to watch sports for 12 hours, it can also make a guy feel trapped.  A guy needs to get out of the house, and touch base with the rest of the world.<br>  <br>  It's typical for a guy to think of home as a place where he sleeps and keeps his stuff...and that is it.  So he has not attachment to it, unless he needs to sleep or do something with that stuff.  Otherwise the guy will just leave the home.
SqDWUl8zaa	well depends on if your friends...<br>  most people dont want to ruin friendships but dont wait to long...<br>  if shes a friend, you could always try and see if she likes you too..<br>  and if shes a girl you dont talk to very often.. try to get to know her more<br>  and make sure she knows you dont just see her as a friend and are interested in something more.
6507eb67b40c198c7f9e69ac4296c97faa	Difficult, one of life's dilemmas. If you tell him you risk losing one or both of them as a friend, but if you keep quiet you'll burn with anger inside about it. Think about how much you value your friendship before saying anything.|`|cgQrQSvDaa	no matter what she does good or bad your her friend NOT HIS and you should keep it to yourself. I watched my sister do that to a boyfriend of hers and I always felt very bad for him but thats my sister i cant just back stab her and tell on her. And the one time that i did do that my whole family got on my case it was just drama for me and i dont know about you but i dont like having drama. So i'd just say something to her about how wrong that is of her to do that to him being he is a nice guy and maybe she will knock it off. otherwise he will find out on his own in time it always comes out.|`|BNCpLcLoaa	You should tell her to tell him. He has a right to know and make his own choice if he forgives her or not.<br>  <br>  Any chance you could have feelings for him?<br>  <br>  If she wont tell him then you have to.<br>  <br>  :)|`|4AKiarekaa	i think you should tell him.<br>  hes going to find out eventually ad it would be better if he finds out from you or her than bumping into ur friend and her new bf  and then getting hurt ... just tell him so he know what to expect and prepare himself.. yea it sucks i kno.. but he seems rele sweet and sweet guys deserve better.. im not saying ur friends a ***** .. im just saying if her bf is ur friend now then u should let him kno..<br>  <br>  hope i helped at least a little<br>  good luck

If you're asking if you match - yeah spose|`|houWY7qvaa	What do I think?<br>  I think you kinda look like T-Bozz and he kinda looks like Justin Timberlake.<br>  If you do not want to ruin your friendship and don't see him as boyfriend material then don't hurt him like that, cause he must really like you.<br>  Otherwise, go for it!|`|FFrSdS2Daa	CANT JUDGE BY LOOKS ALONE. <br>  (but he does look nice)

Next, put something on the floor. It doesn't have to be soft. When you're ready and your partner looks ready, you two can begin painting the walls. I hope this helps.

tVqLmImUaa	Poor you. This definitely deserves a response. I'd tell the few people that did make the effort how much you appreciated their presence, because this kind of event only happens once in a lifetime.<br>  <br>  Then I'd probably send an email to all 4 bridemaids expressing your disappointment, but not making any accusations. Say you were very grateful for the shower. While you didn't have high expectations, you did however, feel hurt that you were not being able to share the meaningful occasion with more friends.  Make your feelings clear.<br>  <br>  Don't take the blow-offs too personally. That is absolutely ridiculous that invites were issued via a "facebook event".Thoughtless, lazy  organization! I'd say that's the main reason they didn't come.  It makes the whole thing seem casual and impersonal. Personally, I myself get turned off attending events posted on facebook.|`|aipChC3haa	I would suggest confronting your bdidal party because it shows that they aren't very serious about their duty.<br>  I think that after you confront them, you can kind of hint on having a re-do bridal shower.<br>  <br>  I'm really sorry it was so horrible!|`|CLDR1isQaa	Im really sorry this happened to you becasue i felt the same way at my 6 year old birthday party...my mom was the only one who came.....(i forgot to send the invitations....:()Well at mine this is wat i did...<br>  me and my fiance (now my husband) rented a spinning dance floor for people to watch us spinnn and break it down. then we had many chances for everyone to find their love. then we played Battle of the Sexes (a board game) and had refreshments. Then we had a father-daughter and mother-son dance. and then we had a delicious italian dinner with some COFFEE ICECREAM and then watched finding nemo because it means alot to us (we met eachother at the library watching this movie because we were the only 20 year olds (hint:it was a teen movie)|`|c27920620869d3d5b40c4f7c78b6b42aaa	It could be worse, no one threw me a bridal shower. <br>  <br>  Try to think of it this way- Right now is a really tight time for people, and there are a lot of people out of work, or worried about being out of work. Maybe the 15 people just didn't have the guts to say. "Right now I can't really afford a present for you, and get you a great wedding present." Try not to take it personally, it's trying times for everyone out there and I'm sure it had less to do with you and more to do with the economy.|`|dpk9n2SSaa	I am so sorry! Personal hand-written invitations should have been mailed out to all of your guests by those giving the shower and they were very thoughtless not to do so. You are the one who ends up feeling hurt and cheated. A wedding shower is a very important event and those giving it to you should have handled it by sending invitations and calling everyone to remind them so you would have a great turnout. You may want to rethink who your real friends are and who you can depend on in the future. They really dropped the ball...Make some new friends. Best wishes on your wedding and marriage.|`|tb0NMaooaa	i'd be glad for those that were there! forget those who didnt come!<br>  <br>  I dont remember mine. I was pretty sick with  upper res. infection. YUCK<br>  <br>  I do know my only grandma didnt come but she could come to a 1yr old bday party for my aunts/uncles former foster kid's kid. The reason she gave was it was too far to drive. but the bday party was even farther away. The kid wont know: but I will remember!|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I wanted to answer this because I had a similiar experience.  My bridal shower was supposed to be announced 2 weeks beforehand, which would have been plenty of time for everyone, but somehow it didn't get done till one week beforehand.  I arrived at my shower and waited around for awhile to open gifts because hardly anyone was there.  There were about 50 chairs set up and only about 20 of them were occupied.  I finally started opening gifts expecting more people to show up.  I opened gifts for about 15 minutes, then it was all done!  There was tons of food leftover.  I was pretty upset because I had SO looked forward to it.  All of my friends had had huge showers and opened gifts for over an hour, and mine was over in 15 minutes.  I'm really sorry about what happened.  It still hurts sometimes when I think of it because I had really looked forward to it.  Not necessarily because of the gifts, but every bride looks forward to her shower, and I had too, and then I didn't really get one.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	You realize that the world keeps spinning and this too shall pass. Something I did after my wedding when we had several people who sent Will Attend RSVP's and then didn't was send them a, "We missed you, Sorry you couldn't make it" card with our picture enclosed. Some people called or wrote and said congrats or let us know that they had a family emergency and couldn't make it and that's fine. I know and can accept that crap happens and you can't always be where you want to be. Along with your Thank You cards you can send Sorry We Missed You cards and maybe get a little congratulations and well wishes.|`|ZVcFFeEoaa	Well theres no way to really ''handle'' this other then to speak up, I think your bridal party was very irresponsible and did not do their bridesmaid duties in contacting people and making the phone calls and they at least should have stayed and cleaned up for you. You should definitely speak up and maybe theres time to throw another one?|`|qfUjyUDTaa	Man, that sucks! <br>  <br>  A facebook event is not the way to invite people to a bridal shower - how tacky! <br>  <br>  Id speak up - you need to talk to the bridesmaids involved and tell they you're dissapointed and explain why. <br>  Thank them for the effort they did put in but explain that your disspointed with the facebook invite....thats lame. They should have called each invitee or send invites in the mail.<br>  <br>  Slack! Speak up!|`|AkUhaMm9aa	Wow im sorry it didnt work out, you must feel pretty bad..there is nothing you can do, at least you know the ones that really care for you..sometimes events like this help you get to know people...dont be hurt, just have a talk with your bridesmaids and tell them that you need them to be more organized and that you were expecting them to take this a little more serious..and hopefully they will get your message and be more responsible for your wedding...<br>  <br>  thats all i can tell you..sometimes is best not to expect too much from people..because you can get very dissapointed and hurt.<br>  <br>  congratulations on your wedding!|`|EJSdI25Naa	Their turn will come. But when you receive an invite from them, you can say "No thanks" if you want to. Just "No thanks." But I would not necessarily cross them off. It is always nice to have somebody to talk to and it is impossible to mantain a best friends relationship with 20 different people. just know that you miht not necessarily be able to rely upn them and, most importantly, don't fall sucker to help them out of a situation to your own personal detriment. You'll know what I mean after the first time it happens.,<br>  <br>  Well, five people would not make much mess. You can look after that even though I hink it was thoughtless of your girls,and yourself, not to pitch inand get it all over and done with before the evening was over.<br>  <br>  You ae lucky to have four good friends, anyway. The rest? Well they have shown that they are acquaintances. Just accept it. We realy do not meet many people who are close friends in this life. <br>  <br>  Now, it is up to you. Continue to feel slighted and be miserable or watch a relly funny t.v. show and have a real good belly laugh. remember, marriages are not made up of bridal showers. Your beau will be bound to change in your eyes, too if you see it that way. <br>  <br>  Don't,whatever you do, let that happen. He can be your greatest support. You must be his. You do not have the luxury of snide remarks in marriage. He'll need you by his side often enough. Be there.<br>  Whatever you do, don't give the palt excuseslike your exfriends gave you. Wives do, all to often and that is just one good reason the man will find someone else. <br>  <br>  Anyway, you'll live. Just see the cruel lesson it has brought you. <br>  <br>  And I do hope you have a really lovely wedding.

Haha, I remember those days. I can't believe I was ever so immature.|`|QhfFndgiaa	She's nervous.

So just tell her how you feel =D Because it's obvious she's into you!|`|vwoqIUR6aa	she just really wants your attention. she is also playing hard to get. maybe try ignoring her for a bit to see if she actually talks to you and stops playing this game. she does like you for sure-she just doesn't know what she is doing.|`|31gN5L58aa	she's *trying* to play hard to get, my opinion<br>  and it's noottt really working...<br>  anyways she seems pretty mean :P<br>  and...<br>  please answer!!!!!!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090221170522AAO85T9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a>|`|pj02ePxAaa	all i have to say is: girls are stupid sometimes. guys do the same thing. ?|`|BmU1755Uaa	one word: vulnerability...<br>  <br>  If you like her, and she likes you, she is vulnerable. If you don't like her, and she likes you, she is vulnerable. As long as she likes you, you are her weakness... dangerous to her.<br>  <br>  Get her to not like you and you have a shot :)<br>  <br>  Sorry, females are really hard work sometimes.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	She's shy and wants you to make the first move. She told your friends because she knew they wouldn't keep it a secret and would tell you. Now that you know she likes you, she hangs around you but doesn't say anything because she wants you to say something. That way she'll know that you like her back.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	Sounds like she likes you dude. When I was in middle school I used to be mean to the guys I liked. And I would never talk to them directly, I would be too nervous, so I would just chat it up with his friends and try to make him jealous. If this girl is older...then she is very immature.|`|hhRDjIvZaa	I think she's playing "hard-to-get". She OBVIOUSLY likes you, from the nervous body language and wanting your attention. She wants you to confess your feelings about her before she confesses hers. At least, I think that's what she's doing.|`|PRCfCSDxaa	All of that is just about right except for the mean part. If my crush came and talked to me, I'd be more than nice to him lol. Some girls think by playing mean, they won't think you like them... Bah, I don't know. I'm never mean =D!|`|MWg8RvlKaa	When you find the answer please spread the word bro! Because the rest of us are dieing for the answer as well.|`|gHCSkzkRaa	shes afraid of rejection|`|MPbB0ri1aa	She is probably confused as well. These feelings are as new to her as they are to you and she is trying to figure out how to handle them. She may, also, be afraid of rejection or pressure she does not feel ready for yet.<br>  <br>  How well do you know her friends? Maybe you can talk to them about planning a group activity that includes you and her in the group. That may give you a better chance to talk to her.  Try being just friends at first. There is less pressure and not as scary. There is no need to jump into a couple relationship right away.|`|eyGAytOTaa	In my opinion, thats not exactly the case with every girl. In your case, she maybe too nervous to talk to you because she has this huge crush on you. Her heart might be throbbing just by your sight. Since she does not have control over her emotions, so she has no control over her reactions and turns out to be mean when she does not want to be mean.She is probably frustrated because she cannot seem to express her feelings to you and does not want to look weak before you. Simply because (first) she does not know you, ( second ) she does not want to look sleazy. <br>  <br>  I believe the best way to get her to speak to you properly is to take her out of the crowd to somewhere quiet and find out about her. Give her sometime to break her nervousness around you and then she will feel more relaxed. She will start to open up and you will be able to see her true personality. It just takes some time depending on how much of a crush you have on her and want to be patient with her!|`|aW7JLj0Caa	lol! Yeah girls are hard to understand.<br>  <br>  I think you are in this situation where two people like each other, but too shy to confront each other. <br>  <br>  She probably wants to keep you by to silently tell the world that she likes you. But the avoiding might mean that she's to shy to confront you directly. As for the mean part, it might just be nerves. I don't think she's really ready to open up yet to her crush. <br>  <br>  It's an awkward situation, but I believe it can be solved by some waiting on your part while trying to talk to her. Don't over do it, but just be there for her and talk to her. Hopefully, she responds positively, but if not, back away.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, good luck!|`|ObicYeTdaa	she's intimidated by you. <br>  <br>  she's trying her best to show you she <br>  likes you without actually telling you.<br>  <br>  And she flirts around other guys in front<br>  of you to make you jealous<br>  and feel like its possible that you might<br>  lose her if you don't make a move quick.<br>  <br>  basically she likes you,<br>  but doesn't want to be the one who<br>  asks the other out.<br>  <br>  talk to her and do that guy stare thing.<br>  (stare deep into her eyes hella sincerely lol)<br>  and if she blushes, keep talking to her.<br>  <br>  SHE LIKES YOU.|`|5HYbJmbcaa	Well most girls feel uncomfortable with guys no matter how long they've been with them. She probably just wants to stay in a large group, making sure that you don't do anything to her when your alone- and i know you probably wouldn't but she prob. thinks otherwise. so just stay calm about it and keep doing it she will get over it eventauly.|`|PPst7jtSaa	its just the way girls are . well for me talking to my crushes isn't really a big deal but i do always want them to notice me . that's what every girl wants from their crush....is their attention.

She's scared of rejection and she wants to know you like her, but she's not sure how to handle the situation. Try talking to her and she might not be as weird. Ask her if she likes you and if so, talk to her about it. DO NOT be degrading or awkward. Be prepared for any response.|`|K76m0wyjaa	Haha girls are weird and very confusing when it comes to relationships, so you better get used to it! :p <br>  She could be nervous and maybe thinks that you don't like her, maybe just inexperienced with dating/relationships. Taking about other guys and talking to other guys could be her attempt to make you jealous or get you to ask her out.|`|55kDtT7Taa	because the girl is shy when shes face to face with him. thats why its a 'crush'. when she crushes on someone she wants that other person to notice her, and she wants to know more about him. <br>  <br>  but at times, she doesnt want to talk to her crush because she is scared that he doesnt like her. if you like a girl that is crushing on you, you should either tell her that you like her too, and go out, or just stop leading her on.<br>  <br>  dont always wait for her to talk to you, guys should make the first move. i know guys are shy too but thats the basic procedure for chatting with a girl. he goes up and starts it. if you dont talk to her, she might think you dont like her. so guys make the first move first!goodluck|`|KGNLO2LOaa	lol im also confused.<br>  she probably just trying to hind the fact that she really likes you but for some reason... maybe she also like another guy? if i were you i'd get a way for her to talk to you or you should talk to her at some points and she how she reacts... <br>  <br>  if it going good... ask her out!

You sound like a good dad and the best thing for our daughter. Message me in your profile, as I have had personal experience to do with custody cases (unfortunately).<br>  <br>  The justice system is fairly "But the girl needs her mother!"<br>  <br>  PM me on my profile if you want to know my story...I don't want to post it here.<br>  <br>  Be willing to compromise shared custody, but your ex will fight for her as hard as she can, as having her will mean you paying her regularly and she knows you would not refuse to make a point at the expense of your daughter's well being.<br>  <br>  I'm glad to see a good father who wants to take care of his child and is willing to do whatever he can to be in her life. More men should have a better sense of fatherhood like you.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	This shouldn't be about who is better than the other. This is about what is best for your child, and ideally that would be for both of you to have joint custody and to share the load. Stop putting yourself first and put your child's needs first.|`|VygBNA0Waa	keep a journal of money you spend a daily routine every time she calls and sees your daughter and every thing else dates times that is the best thing you can do that is what out lawyer told us and we got full custody of my two stepson <br>  good luck
kov7p4Y8aa	Ok, in eighth grade there is no "cheating" lol<br>  not to belittle your story. Its very cute and unlikely, which is sweet.<br>  But I don't know, if you never really talk, then you don't really know her.<br>  People change alot from third grade believe me. <br>  I'd ask her about it and be a little more aggressive with the communication if you want it to go anywhere.<br>  In another year or so you may still be together, or you may not care anymore. Thats just how it goes.<br>  Hope it works out but it does sound like she's flirting.<br>  That doesnt qualify as cheating though just yet, some people are just like that. But she needs to do something about it if you are going to be with her. <br>  Good luck my little friend :)|`|SorcFv62aa	Dude get rid of her i know a girl who did the same thing to my friend he wasn't sure if she was but she was. Dude just dump that shet|`|d985a6ca67c1cd9f4b34a20bd0e904f1aa	Just talk to her more that is very important. Maybe since you don't talk she thinks you don't like her. Girls always like to talk to guys so you shouldn't have much of a problem just talk to her.|`|gvIDj1wGaa	ok....just make sure she reli doing that..and email me wat is going on....for now just act normal........DON'T DO ANYTHING!..ok....just email me about the update and i'll give u someadvise..ok...XD|`|jbEjq5aHaa	she probably wants ur attention or wants to feel cared about becuz u said u two dont really talk and that must be a rather empty relationship<br>  <br>  i'd try to pay more attention to her, so she remembers that u still care about her (by attention i mean talk to her)<br>  but if she really does like that guy just put in the effort to remind her why she liked u before
tU5NJVL3aa	I hate reading stories like this -- why did you marry him?  He's obviously the same guy that he was before you tied the knot and made a baby.  Yes, you have reason to be upset, but I doubt that you have any realistic chance of anything changing.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Marriage is hard work.  However it is much harder if your spouse chooses to be friends with people who are ACTIVELY trying to sabotage your marriage.  It is incredibly disrespectful to you, frankly it is openly hostile, for his friends to try to set him up in front of you.  <br>  <br>  It is not healthy for your marriage for you to deny him a guys night out.  However he should not be asking for a "guys night" with friends who are out to "get laid".  If he can find some mature friends who want to do normal "married" guy stuff (poker night, shoot pool, bowling, etc) I think you should give him a chance to prove that he is worthy of your trust.  <br>  <br>  I am 46 and will give you one last word of advice.  Be advised this is a very politically incorrect thing to say but it is true.  My wife wanted to be a SAHM from the start.  And I was ok with that.  And for 19 of our 20 years together I worked she stayed at home.  She took GREAT care of me and my needs and I tried to do the same for her.  But she took a huge risk.  I built a career, a great professional network and a bunch of really useful skills during that time.  We are both loyal so our story has a happy middle and likely happy ending.  If she had handled the physical/sexual part of our marriage the way many women apparently do she would have been a single mother of 3 a long time ago.  A sad ending for both of us.  She stayed fit (largely because I asked her to) and she rocked my world on a regular basis.  During our marriage many women attempted to tempt me.  They all failed.  And they failed because my wife made me invulnerable to temptation.  <br>  <br>  I hope you can find a way to walk the tight-rope:  That is to be firm so you are not mistreated, but very loving and supportive so your husband acts the way you want him to.|`|e1oky4jSaa	You do have a reason; he proved himself untrustworthy the last time you trusted him. When this happened to me with my daughters father, after his first affair I got back with him but he did the exact same thing further down the road. I remarried a faithful man and now I am much happier. You don' t need to be with someone that treats you like crap.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	It's not a normal life for you not to allow him out with his friends sometimes. It will be hard for you because he is a cheater but you chose to take him back. You should also make some friends and make sure you have nights out too.|`|p8RvGtNYaa	Hindsight is 20/20. He was not ready to get married and be a responsible father.  Guess you didn't know that.  He misses the single's life -- actually most guys do but the mature ones know how to handle this sensibly|`|Yx5GlOJDaa	OK, I feel the same way. My husband and I have a 2 1/2 month old daughter and before I had her i was on bedrest and couldn't really go anywhere and we moved to Minneapolis,MN and i don't know anyone down here and I old have friends that are 2 hours north of me. But my husband has been out clubbing with his friends down here and a female friend who I really hate also and he has spent the night over there a few times and had BS excuses for doing it!! But anyways, if your husband can't devote himself to you and his friends are more important than his own son and his wife than I guess it's time to find yourself a real man. If he really loved you he would have never cheated on you to begin with and he would respect your feelings about hanging out with "the guys"!!! I understand where your coming from and how you feel cause I had the same problem with my husband too!!! But don't take any BS from him.|`|oqQdutsfaa	Your not being a child at all! He's the one that needs to grow up. I would just let him know that it is either you and the baby or his dumb *** friends! He has steak at home and going out for a damn hamburger! You should just leave one night you and your child and go stay in a hotel just to relax and see how much he starts to worry then!|`|VPMUuIxUaa	you're not being a child about this!  he need to realize that he is a husband and a father and he better start acting like one or one of these days he won't be either one because both of you will be gone. Good luck on this one!|`|2n0vR0OMaa	You sound as though you have reason to be concerned. First Being a SAHM is isolating- join parents centre and playcentres etc.. great adult contact for you and way to meet people.You need to escape from the house with your son and enjoy yourself a little! Can you afford to go home on a holiday, leaving dad to look after his child for the weekend? <br>   Given his past cheating he should be more contrite, and understanding. He is a dad, with a wife and child, so needs to have grown out of the blokes on the booze mentality.Yes, he has a right to go out, my hub went hunting fishing etc... not bars thankfully. You have a right too...|`|4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	My opinion is If you don't trust him you won't get very far with him.  If he cheated once he more than likely will do it again.  I have been married for 12 years, had 3 kids and been cheated on multiple times.  Stop worrying about what you can't control because at the end of the day he is his own person.  He just may be a jerk and there's nothing you can do about it.  You can't make him change if he doesn't want to.  Focus on the well being of your son and your make a little time for yourself too.  You need to be in a good state of mind especially if you are a SAHM.  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA11208683	honestly i think you shouldn't of married him in the first place if you caught him cheating that just proves that he didn't deserve you if he couldn't stay faithful to you. and i understand why you don't trust him i wouldn't trust him ever again and if you know his friend then you know how they act. he made a commitment to you when you got married and he needs to respect that. and honestly if you have to get a divorce do it. i don't believe in getting a divorce but if hes going to act like a child then he doesn't deserve you. he has a wife and a little boy now that is his responsibiliy and if he can't own up to that then it just shows how immature he is! yes, i do believe that you to need to have alone time, but if hes going to go out and cruise for the ladies with his friends then that isn't alone time that just being a loser. you need to talk to him. you need to show him how much it hurts you when he doesn't show his love to you. if he loves you he won't cheat on you. everyone says that if your man cheats on you then your not satisfying him enough but that is not true at all. once you make a commitment together you should stick to it THROUGH THICK AND THIN. but hunny i think you deserve someone better.... and you shouldn't of married him if he cheated once already that should he wasn't willing to commit to you. GOOD LUCK! i really hope things get better for you!|`|Ncad6d57aa	Adultery is one of the reasons it is okay to get a divorce, according to the bible. It puts a lot of strain on the marriage and it is hard to trust someone after that. You guys should find couples to hang out with, tell him to drop his single guy friends for guys night because it's kind of selfish. You and your kids should be his number one priority. Get counseling to resolve the issues in your marriage (if he's willing) and if he's not I would get a divorce. Even though you have a kid together, it's better for you guys to be separate and have a healthy relationship rather than staying together and as your kids get older seeing unhealthy habits like that. Best of luck to you.|`|XB996f1naa	you have every right to be upset. i don't blame you he needs to get a new set of friends. if he brings up the divorce word that's not good either.ask him how he would feel if the tables were turned i bet he would not like it. if possible i would have  a girls night out. even if it is just you and one other friend. i dont really think he can be trusted. sorry|`|aeLyiRczaa	You seem to have missed the boat in that you still married this guy and had a kid with him after your caught him cheating.  That is certainly grounds to call your judgment and logic into question, unless of course there is a lot more to it.   'I am sure we do not know all the facts to include what may or may not have contributed to the cheating.  It does take two.  <br>  <br>  From what you posted, I believe that you are being perfectly reasonable about this.  The problem is, he must begin to see and understand this.  Actually, you may be well advised to show him this question and the answers you receive.  That may help to wake him up.<br>  <br>  I find that many people who get married, still believe they can act single and it is somehow okay.  I also find that many people who are married, are not wise enough to realize the things they do which give their mate very very good reason to be worried or to question them.  Worse, yet, most of the current counselors and therapists are practicing liberal nonsense instead of just using common sense and telling people they are acting a fool and they need to stop.  <br>  <br>  Your husband needs to realize that if he wished to be and act single, he should not have gotten married, much less made a child with you,  If he will not do so, he is a boy as shown by his actions.  Children do not need to be raised and trained by boys.  That requires men.  And a man is evident by his actions as well as his words.  Seems that your hubby is failing on this.|`|AA10465474	First of all, I have to applaud you for being a SAHM I did it for the first 11 months of my sons life and it is one of the hardest things I did. I had to go back to work to have some adult time. <br>  <br>  Second you have every right to be upset with him, he doesn't realize what a hard job you have. On the other hand, you cannot stay at home all the time with a child. Remember you are an adult and need interactions with other adults as well. My suggestion to you is to slowly wheen him off of his single friends and find some couple friends. The best thing you can do is find friends that have kids and go out on double dates. Get a sitter, your child will not resent you for taking a night out every once in a while for yourself. If you don't take some time for yourself, you will go crazy and resent your husband so much more. Get a sitter and go with him. Or if you reeaally don't trust him, get a sitter and follow him:-)
4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	Well, that's a lie. But he's trying to assure you that he's not in it STRICTLY for the sex. If he wasn't into you, he wouldn't say THAT. I know that it might come off as a slap in the face, but trust me, the fact that he told you that is a good sign.|`|GPGHPw7eaa	it means he wants you for you<br>  and not for a sex toy|`|9cB44q0Vaa	haa mine says that too and were only 22 and 27 so it sucks on a friday night when im drinking and he jsut lasy there and i have to initate it all the time..or i can never play with him and get him going it sucks sometimes

RpMfrVb3aa	Everyone are different but if you want to go nude, make sure you have the body for it or you are going to make people sick.|`|WuBQNC10aa	I was introduced to nudism when I was 16 by a friend who was a third generation nudist. In addition to her immediate family, her mom's siblings' families were nudists as well. I went to several backyard cookouts at her house as well as a few trips to the family cabin. <br>  <br>  No one in her family went around the house nude all the time, especially in winter (except when we used the hot tub.) At the cabin, everyone was in various states of dress (or undress) the whole time. No one wore bathing suits when we swam, but at night almost everyone has clothes on because of bugs or because it was chilly. Aside from that, it was pretty normal. <br>  <br>  The family in general was a bit on the liberal side. Her mom was an artist and her one uncle and his wife were musicians. <br>  <br>  I've also run into many families at nudist clubs and beaches throughout the US. They come from all walks of life. Most are white, but I've met black and asian nudist families as well. The kids are pretty much like non-nudist kids. However the nudist teens I've met always seem to be engaging and talkative than non-nudist teens. <br>  <br>  I've told this story before, but here it goes again....<br>  One time at a clothing-optional club I met a woman who was there with her teen daughter. Both wore swimsuits the entire first day they were there. Mom hung out with the other adults and the daughter was hanging out with the other teens and college aged people. As night approached I was in the hot tub and the mom was there saying how she wanted to get nude but was afraid how her daughter would react. A few minutes later a few of us went to play volleyball at the other end of the pool. Mom satyed in the hot tub. Everyone who went to play volleyball was nude except for the daughter, who also stated she wanted to be nude but was afraid how her mom would react. One of my female friends approached the young lady and informed her about what her mom had just said a few minutes ago. With that, the daughter took off her swimsuit and went over to the hot tub. Mom was both shocked and relieved, and also shed her swim suit. Then both joined the volleyball game. For the rest of the weekend they hung out together instead of doing thier own things. <br>  <br>  That was like 10 years ago. I still exchange email with the mom from time to time. Her daughter and her kept going to the club and other nudist places as well. They've met awesome people and her daughter married a nudist and they have 2 kids. His parents are nudists too and the family is very close.|`|AA11971497	When I was growing up, my favorite cousin was an idealist hippie type.  When he was married, it was generally known that they were nudists, and that their son was being raised that way.  No surprise, as his son was almost always naked during our weekly visits, though him and his wife would dress.  <br>  <br>  Though my parents did not approve of their "lifestyle", they were otherwise wonderful people and we always enjoyed our visits.<br>  <br>  The boy became a police officer who works with kids.  And I became a nudist on my own after college.  I've met many nudist families, and I'd say they are in general better off for it.
cAhtEdeSaa	I would be mad and it would be really hard for me to trust her. Not because of being insecure but because girls are really scandalous to each other now a days. Tell your boyfriend you would prefer him not go but if you want him to have a good time than let him.|`|96zZlJVYaa	well I see something wrong with this picture from the start. if a girl who suppose doesn't like your boyfriend and turn around and ask him to join her and 6 others girls out to the club. And secondly your boyfriend should tell her no that he going to spend the weekend with you. now if he accept the invite over spending the weekend with you (knowing that you're not old enough to go into the club). I would have some concern.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	All past issues aside, there is no reason for a young man to go out with seven females without his partner. If he wants to go clubbing he can do so just as well with his male mates. And little miss oh so amazing is making a play for your guy. No better way than to get him away from you at a club and get him pissed. He you can probably trust, her not so much!|`|VPOVFc6laa	ouch! damn iwould deffinetly would! but you know sometimes when you show your partner that youre insecure they take advantage of htat. so try to keep it low and from there investigate his intentions towards this girl, and hers to towords your man.|`|wlfOhnDoaa	Well, yeahh I would be a bit pissed off because as you say, you don't know what they could get up to basically, I know this sounds a little risky because when you go to the bar in a club or even before you go into a club they can ask for .I.D., but do you think you look 18, or maybe doll yourself up a little and look a bit older you could always take a chance and go along with them, but this is totally up to you. Hope I helped , sorry for the long answer Loolz. xx
K0r2yEQmaa	Wow, you have quite a dilemma. If she says she's ok about you being gay, perhaps that's a foot in the door. Has she recently expressed any interest in any guys? You said she's over the guy she had a crush on before... What about any new guys...? If she's popular, she may be concerned about her "image". Getting involved with another girl might be something she's uncomfortable with from a "social" standpoint. <br>  Ask her how she feels about you (and your friendship). Maybe come at it from a different angle. Ask her if she thinks you're attractive. Maybe just some "friendly" touches once in a while (in private). if she seems ok with it, make it a little more flirtatious. If she still seems comfortable, maybe ask her for a hug or something sometime.  Treat her how you'd want to be treated if the situation were reversed. Its an awkward situation. If she suggests again that a mutual interest would be creepy, don't necessarily agree with her. You're eroding your own efforts by doing that. Maybe even ask her why she thinks it'd be creepy. <br>  It might make her nervous b/c she might be confused about her feelings toward you. Maybe she just enjoys your friendship and feels like getting "involved" might complicate things.<br>  I wish you the best of luck in whatever happens. You seem like a really thoughtful person. I hope you don't get hurt.|`|s4hQpvJYaa	tell her you cant hide these feelings forever|`|oFeNwMheaa	I would have a lot to say about this, why don't email me billybob111@rocketmail.com and I'll give you some one on one advice!|`|Mk0o8D9Paa	I would be extremly grossed out and probably say the quote "homie don't play that game" to you.

4AKiarekaa	ok fisrt of all seems to me that you eally like this guy. cool maybe you should ask him straight up who he likes? even if he kissed you it doesnt always mean a guys likes you. when i was reading your question the moment you mentioned him liking ur best friend i was thinking.. maybe hes using you to get to her.. guys are jerks.. not all  theyre are amazing guys out there. but anyways i think u should just ask him who he likes .. if he says you wait a couple days and par attention to his actions if he seems to be getting closer to you then go for it. if  he told u he liked you and doesnt rele act different i think hes just using u to get to ur friend...in all honesty....relationships between best friends (more than 3 besties) most likely end up tearing the group apart..<br>  so figure out if he likes you and then go from there..<br>  i wish you the best of luck|`|Rf9eWfCvaa	Well first you should find out for sure if he likes your friend or not and if he does you should end the relationship so you 2 can remain friends with each other.|`|QUmqfjSuaa	Don't Tell Him Or Anybody, Keep It To Yourself.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Keep to yourself.|`|zz2inOIZaa	Talk to him about it<br>  let him know how you feel<br>  and see how he feels about you<br>  I made the mistake of not talking about it with my best guy friend after he kissed me and now he is with another girl for about a year already<br>  <br>  you will regret it when he moves on without you<br>  <br>  besides, what's the worst that could happen?<br>  he's your best friend, you will get through it together

xDdhUldraa	He may be holding out to prevent pregnancy.  He may just enjoy getting you off?  I know there are times when I would rather make my mate happy and satisfied rather than myself.  If he says he is fine than accept it and move on from there.  The best thing to do is ask him though.  Don't be looking for problems that do not exist.  Never read between the lines with a guy.

It's your boyfriend's friend.  He can hang out with whomever he likes and he doesn't need your permission.  You are not his mommy.

Then you won't need to worry about the fact that your boyfriend has no spine.|`|if140waXaa	Why does your boyfriend hang out with such a loser? It makes me wonder what kind of man your boyfriend is. Tell him you won't hang out with him when he is with his loser friend. No man should ever tolerate someone disrespecting his girlfriend.

Don't get entangled in their web.|`|AA10188961	you should feel completely hurt if you boyfriend does not stand up for you.  At the beginning of a relationship its natural for a man to look for approval from his friends.  It sounds as if you have been together with him long enough for that stage to have past.  He is putting his friends opinions and feelings before yours.  That could be a sign that you're putting more into the relationship than he is.  I'm married, and if one of my husband's friends said anything disrespectful to me, I wouldn't have to say a word, it would be taken care of.  The guy would be lucky if he left the area in one piece!!

QdCwBSVQaa	I think you're being pretty reasonable.  I would just spin the request as "I would love for you to have flowers in your hair, would you mind doing that?  Oh, and the stylist we'll be using said that these 5 were do-able."  <br>  <br>  If you phrase it that way (instead of "you MUST pick one of these"), you make it sound like they are doing a nice thing for you, and that you are just trying to make the process more convenient for them.  And keep an open mind.  One of the gals might have a sixth style that she's comfortable with, that you like, and that your stylist can do.  Go with it.  Everyone will be prettier if they are comfortable with how they look.|`|4fe7aff6fc9d1806e4060e8d88d58d4aaa	Well, it is really great that you are paying for all of this but then again, it is their hair.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully you know the girls well enough to know what they like and what they would just hate.  It's great that you are giving them 5 choices and I'd think for most of them they'd be perfectly happy. But you might want to be prepared for at least one who wont be happy with your decision and will want her hair her own way.  At that point I'd say, just let it go, it simply isn't worth making a hassle out of hair.  Even if you are paying I dont think it is ok for you to dictate how anyone looks.|`|Nc7clhzIaa	Yes, you have every right to be choosy.  This is your one and only day to shine.  This is an unforgettable moment for you & your soon to be husband :).  5 choices is not asking too much at all.  Most people I know have to pay for the whole dress.  I think it is an important, special, & formal occasion.  Everyone wants the perfect wedding.  You are not asking much at all.  Congrats!!!  & Good Luck|`|YsiJiOqXaa	This is the away I see it. It is YOUR wedding and you should have everything the way YOU want it. One of my girls didn't like the dress we picked but oh well. Everyone else liked it and I love it so that is what we went with. Now the hair...I haven't really decided on it. I might let them do what they want. But mine is a beach wedding so it's more simple. Maybe if you are wanting their hair up then just have everyone ut it up but let them choose how. I would be too much to have all matching hair. At least give them a little say so.|`|093adb8ec6136150f94ebe4b7a62899eaa	I would say that is a bit over the top. Even if you are paying half, an up do is an up do. Why is it necessary that you pick which one. Shoes, jewelry, dresses, I can see, but hair? Cmon. thats being a bit bridezilliash.|`|BqrQFLH5aa	thats perfectly fine. you're the bride, so you should and do get to pick what the bridesmaids's wear and what their hair looks like.|`|ckJP6TTQaa	I think that's very generous of you to pay for half of their dresses, their spa treatments and all of the hair styles. <br>  <br>  I was at a wedding where we had to pay for all of these things -- and I didn't even want any of it! I did, however, get to pick my own hairstyle, and I had fun with it in the end. <br>  <br>  I don't think it's completely unreasonable for you to have some say in their hair since you're paying for it, but it seems a little anal-retentive to insist that their hair has to be one of the 5 styles that you choose. First of all, if you limit their options then you might end up with 3 of the four going for the same style and just one going for something different -- which would look lopsided. If, however, you let them each come up with their own choices, then it would be more likely that they would all come up with something different, and you wouldn't have to worry about more than one being in one style, while the others are in random styles. Also, each girl might find something that she really loves and that she totally "glows" in -- rather than having to look uncomfortable in "the hairstyle of the 5 that she disliked the least." Particularly if all their dresses are the same, this is a chance for your bridesmaids to look like individuals. <br>  <br>  Why don't you just have them send you pictures of styles that they like and you can "approve" them? Then they get to pick and you get the option of saying, "I don't think that is the look I'm going for -- what do you think of some of these that I found?" You also increase the chances that each bridesmaid will have a different and unique hairdo, rather than having 2 that match and 2 that are totally different, etc.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Send out an email to them all explaining that you want them to have flowers in their hair. Attach photos of 5 possible choices. Then end the email with, "Let me know which one you like -- and if you have any other ideas for hairstyles that have flowers in them, send me a pic!"|`|hkwBR1moaa	I don't think it's wrong of you to want all the hairstyles alike.  But if you're worried, tell them either up or down, curly or not. Just give them some guidelines.|`|4POGapREaa	Sounds fine to me.  Hair & makeup is all part of the collective vision & vibe you have for the wedding so sure it's okay.  I wouldn't want one bridesmaid with hippie hair & another in a tight bun with red lipstick.  It wouldn't make sense.|`|nqINitkmaa	You should let them wear their hair how ever they want to wear it. You can dictate whether the hair be worn up or down, if you really want to, but anything more than that is just controlling!<br>  <br>  I let my girls choose their dress ( I chose the length, color, and fabric) , their shoes, and I am paying for their hair and make up, but they get to choose how they want it done!|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Well, honestly, even if you are paying for it, why don't you let them choose? I paid for my girls' hair, but I think that picking their hairstyles is a little bridezilla.<br>  <br>  Edit: If she is so selfish, why did you pick her as a bridesmaid? I am sorry, but I think you are a bit over the top here. You are worrying too much about the small details that no one else is going to notice.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Here's what you do: either<br>  a) let them pick the hair style, but you get veto power<br>  b) you pick a few options and they chose which one they like best.<br>  <br>  As long as there is some compromise and you both agree, it sounds good!|`|y6gVmhHxaa	I don't think that is dictating, but I'm wondering why you don't feel your loved ones have enough competence to pick out their own hairstyle.<br>  <br>  Lol!  Okay I see your point.  I was in my SIL's wedding and she dictated our hair down to the last curl.  We honestly didn't care though (and we paid for it ourselves).  She wanted us all to look exactly the same and stressed herself out way too much.  All this stuff seems really important right now but trust me afterwards you'll wonder why you cared at all.  It happens to all of us.
rvoo4rBjaa	You didn't say how long you have been married but things get into rut and once you have separated and gotten back together things change.So maybe you should both sit down and agree on a few things like you each get some time apart from the other at least once a week and then once a week you both have date night- together alone and once every couple weeks agree before you go out with your friends were and what is going to happen. A marriage is a combination of agreement and not who is in control. Maybe even some counseling would be a good idea.|`|B12E4rYiaa	Sounds like she's resentful about when you used to be in control so now it's pay back time. The games need to end the only way you might be able to get the marriage back on track is to have joint and or individual counseling otherwise the battle is for life or until the divorce.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Seek professional counseling.|`|AA11280073	How old are you?

z0kSza6Eaa	Like the Grace Jones song says 'I'm not perfect, but I'm perfect for you.'  Everyone has their faults.  The key is learning to accept your partner, faults and all.  Note that I say 'accept.'   If all you can manage is to tolerate your partner's faults, your chances of success drop dramatically.  Tolerance takes constant work; acceptance frees you to enjoy the good things without worrying about the faults. <br>  <br>  And love does evolve over time.  That first heat of passion that you feel when your love is new fades with time, but a deeper love and appreciation for your partner grows in its place.  I still find my partner just as sexy after ten years as I always have.  But after ten years, there is less of a sense of urgency to express that through sex than there was at the beginning.  I love having sex with him as much as ever, but frankly it is not as important to the relationship as it used to be.  That does not mean that I love him any less.  It is a natural part of the evolution of a long-term relationship.  I feel like I love him even more than I did when we met.  Now I love the person that I actually know, not a person that I am getting to know.  I don't have to have sex with him every day, or even every week, to know that in my heart.|`|AA11646252	No there is not a perfect one but it take understanding on both sides to just find what works.  Yes it is possible to love like in the beginning but you have to overlook the troubles and look at the fun times.<br>  <br>  rd|`|mldo1vxYaa	I think there is people that are perfect for each other in the sense that they understand each other, want the same things and have the same goals and values, and share dreams. I also think if two people love each other a lot and want to build a life together that could be refered to as a perfect partner.<br>  <br>  I dont think the love stays the same, it grows, it matures, it experiences things you couldnt imagine and for that you love them more. If two people are meant for each other things just get better.|`|xDdhUldraa	Nope.  There is no perfect partner.  If there were it would be an owner/salve relationship and that never works.  As humans we look for certain things in a relationship and find that we have to compromise a bit.  If you are looking for a perfect partner, set down the rules on a piece of paper for exactly what you think one would be like.  Then put them in order, priority first.  Also acknowledge things that you would be willing to bend on and others that you won't.  For instance.  One thing I would want in my perfect partner is that they speak English.  I would want them to have teeth.  I would want them to have two hands and two feet.  I find one person that has dentures and has lost a leg in an automobile accident.  Everything else about them works out for me though.  I would be willing to bend on those two things.  Anyway, that is just my opinion.  Good luck in your search for happiness.  Always remember though that life is give and take in a relationship.  If everything goes your way then someone is not doing their job.  In closing and if nothing else, know that a relationship is built on honesty and communication.  If you don't have both of these in your partnership, you have nothing.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  OH, I forgot about the love growing part.  As time moves on you start noticing things in your relationship.  The things that endeared you to your partner start to get on your nerves.  When that happens remember why you are a couple.  I don't think I feel the same way about my wife today that I did 15 years ago.  The love that we have shared has grown and florished into something beautiful and special.  The love we felt for each other at the beginning was a childish and fun thing.  Now it is a mutual respect and caring for each other that can not be dimished.  I find a lot of truth in the saying that I love you more today then yesterday but not as much as tomorrow.  Ah, there.....next?|`|SWYB8iQEaa	Sure there is! Only he is somebody else's boyfriend. Mine ain't perfect.<br>  The love part: in my case the love is getting stronger day by day.|`|9XZ67Umcaa	Hello Dear....I think the only "perfect relationship"  is with your Grand Children.....its all love.......and that is perfect.....
U9r17iZvaa	Do they ever say "just kidding" or are clearly joking when they say this stuff to you? Cuz it sounds like one of these people are really nice. And I really don't think you have the brain the size of a crumb of chese.|`|lgPmVQwZaa	It sounds like they aren't very good friends.  I know that you have probably heard this many times but they are probably jealous of you.  Anybody who is that you you should just ignore. I have heard before that people who are being jerks are looking for a reaction. Don't react when they say things like that to you.  People used to make fun of me because I wasn't as wealthy as they were. I juts ignored it and they stopped saying rude comments to me.  I know that it is really frustrating and it upsets you. I really do. But just act like it doesn't bother you at all.  If they continue, i suggest that you get new friends who accept you for who you are and how your heart is.  Not by the way you are or act.  I am sorry that your friends are being jerks. <br>  And I bet that you are really pretty, too. You just have a bad self image of yourself because you listen to people insulting you half the day!<br>  Sorry and I hope my advice helps.<br>  Corny Gal|`|tFikP6FMaa	if i were you . you should say i dont need to take this **** , im out . go find other people to make fun of and find new friends theyre definetly not giving you the respect you deserve, let them kno they arnt needed by you and then they will probably try to come back to you and if they do tell them to not treat you the way theydid  if they want to be friends with you !!!! :D|`|2kGGd4evaa	Then if they say that kind of stuff leave their not worth it.So just drop them b******* off at the corner and leave them there so you can get on with your life and be happy.|`|ox77vqviaa	well your friends are obviously retarded since all of those comments are mindbogglingly stupid but anyways  i would either get new friends, tell them to **** off, or ignore them....take your pick|`|WxqtNRvLaa	how bout say nothing and if they treat you like crap maybe you need to rethink who your friends are...|`|7IR6kl77aa	yell "SHUT THE **** UP!!" then leave... i don't think they're really your friends if they say crap like that! I've done it, now i have better friends!! yay!!!!|`|K0r2yEQmaa	Find other friends!!!<br>  I went through high school with a group of "friends" who were all a bunch of back-stabbing, two-faced scum. They'd act "friendly" to my face, but get them together when I wasn't there and they'd bad-mouth me. Of course, they'd also bad mouth whichever of us wasn't present at the moment.<br>  None of them were on the "voted most likely to succeed" list either. So they weren't exactly in the position to be criticizing me.<br>  <br>  My best advice would be, find other friends. These people are not your friends. if you just stand there and take it, your silence is their consent to continue to berate you.<br>  <br>  Don't say anything to them, I would just quit associating with them. The best insult you can give back is just distance yourself. When they get the picture that you don't need them, things will change.<br>  <br>  These people are insecure with themselves. They have to cut you down to feel better about themselves. <br>  They need you more than you need them. Chances are, if you're not there, they'll just start attacking each other. Again, not a situation you need.<br>  Regardless of your appearance, be comfortable with yourself and secure in who you are.<br>  They may also resent you for having some quality they see in you they know they lack.<br>  Even if that's not the case, you don't need the insults and harassment.<br>  <br>  Just walk away. If any of them confronts you to ask why you don't hang out with them anymore, just let them know  you've found other friends who value your friendship more than they seem to.<br>  <br>  I give you this advice because I'm speaking from experience. I just wish I had someone who'd have given me that advice when i was in school.<br>  Best wishes to you.|`|gmJAKYTlaa	Sweetheart, you're God's creation and you're beautiful. And you might only feel ugly because they make you feel inferior, you don't dress yourself up right, or ignorant, hating a** people go out of their way to say something to you. F**k them. <br>  <br>  Now: you need to understand that whoever they are, they are not your friends. No kind of friends should treat anyone like that. And if you've told them before how it feels when they say those things, and they're continuing, then lose them. If you haven't told them, then you need to, becuase none of them are psychic. If you laugh it off with them, then they're gonna think you don't mind. And you do! If and when you tell them to "cut the s**t 'cause it's not funny",but they still do it. Once again, lose them. <br>  <br>  I understand that everyone needs friends. And these are probably the ones you hang out with the most, but no matter how you think you look, you don't deserve to be spoken to like that. Surely, and believe it, there are people that are willing to be true friends. You've jsut been closed in with theses losers. With all offense to your 'amigos' ;)<br>  Potential Conversations:<br>  <br>  "You're ugly."..."And you're quite attractive...for a gorilla"<br>  <br>  "You're gonna live in cardboard or watev."..."Keep talking, I'm sure one day you'll say something intelligent."<br>  <br>  "You're so stupid..."..."Britney,brains aren't everything. In fact in your case they're nothing" <br>  <br>  Response to anything they say:<br>  "Ya face" ..."Boo" (you have to say it really dry like you're bored with it)..."Wow, that was so funny" (say this without smiling or laughing. Just dry.)<br>  <br>  Hope i helped. If you lose them...I'll be your email buddy til you find some. =]|`|76nTvO4iaa	Don't say anything. When they start with their insults, leave.<br>  <br>  Find some new friends who don't feel the need to build themselves up by putting you down.<br>  <br>  ((hugs))|`|RqJaLTr5aa	there not ur friends if there saying that kinda stuff to you..|`|lTNcvqyHaa	You are not the ugly one here - they are. <br>  <br>  They seriously need a life and you girl need to seriously get new friends.<br>  <br>  You do not need these people in your life - the question you need to ask yourself is why you feel that they are even worth and answer back.<br>  <br>  If it were me (and believe me I have been called a few things in my growing up years) I had to develop a hard shell (like a tortoise) I took charge of my own life my own way in my own time. <br>  <br>  Ditch the rabbits - cause guess who wins the race in life - the tortoise.<br>  <br>  Talk to your Mum or big Sis (if you have one), and hang out with them for a while, ask your Mum if you both could have a pamper day, get your hair cut and coloured, buy some new clothes, get some bling, and do it together and talk girly stuff. Mums love it and you will love yourself for doing something with out the little jealous beasts around you. Blank them, don't take their calls or read their stupid messages.<br>  <br>  They are bullies - and you should tell them that!   And tell them how sad they must be, to get a kick out of trying to hurt someone else. And tell them that you do not like them for it. Turn your back and walk away ....|`|AA10196995	well if theyre saying the stuff in a messing around way then say something like "don't be jealous or dont hate" and then laugh a bit afterwards  or about the living in a cardboard box say something like heck yes i am  or i dont know but go along with it whether they mean it in a good or bad way when you go along with it theres not much they can say back.|`|sVdCGwIUaa	Well first of all they probably are mean but are not intentional about saying it like that.

I`m not quite sure they`re your considered your FRIENDS if they say these things to you. i`ve had a "friend" like that and beilive me she is a...nvm....anyways she wasn`t really my friend and after i found out she really wasn`t my friend she told other people about my secrets. also she told people things i didn`t really say. i think it`s all because i stole her boyfriend tho =] that`s me!! anywayssssss......tell them calm and nicely (being calm shows that your not afriad to stand up to them) to plz stop calling u names and tell them that they`re not any better than you are. because if you think about it. nobody is BETTER than anybody else. they just THINK they are and when these kind of people THINK things or WANT things they always get what they want.|`|O8pJYz5Kaa	This is what you should say. i wouldn't be taken because everyone who is anyone knows that if they someone is going to hell it really means the person who said it is!

XF9596Xraa	That happened to me my parents filed for divorce & were seperated for 19 months, with 2 young children. <br>  <br>  Hang in there, write a note telling them how you feel, and how you'd like to be a happy family. Try agian to tell them that your stuck in the middle. If they suggest counciling-don't do it. I had 5 counclers & they make people uncoomfortable, and don't every help you. Maybe tell them to get Marrige Councling, you don't have to deal with it, they do. Your a child and they aren't setting a good example, do they want you to grow up, get married & have marrige troubles? My parents still fight everyday & say their going to get divorced, one of them is going to leave. It hurts, I've had that hurt feeling my whole life. Never blame yourself for their problems, I did that and when you do that, you will just get sadder. Spend more time with people who you love, and let them battle it out. Do they sleep in the same bed? My parents have not for a long time, my brother sleeps with my mother. Words hurt more then anything, someone can push you, and you feel nothing much. They can call you a name, and you could cry yourself to sleep. Divorce rates have gone up alot! 50% percent of first marriages, 67% of second and 74% of third marriages end in divorce. Compare that to the 1.1% divorce rate in India, and you'll see-your not alone. America is in a crisis, people are marrying for all the wrong reasons. Let you parents act like the parents-not like immature toddlers. You will learn to live with it, I have some-what addapted to the constant arguing. The only thing you have to look out for is you. Never take sides, it will only sperate you and your mom/dad, it is THEIR issue. P.S. What do they argue about? I only wish you the best & keep strong, till things start heading in the right direction.<br>  <br>  <br>  <3|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Walk in on them one time when they're arguing, and say 'I think you need a mediator.  Daddy, why don't you tell me your side of the story, then Mummy, you can tell me your side, and then I will tell you who is right and wrong."<br>  <br>  They'll both go you (what the heck, it's only noise) but you'll embarrass them into growing up a little.  They're a bit self-absorbed.  They need a shake.  As to your mother, tell her to shove her 'time' and 'space' where the sun don't shine.  <br>  <br>  Another comment: your mother needs to be told by someone, that it is completely out of bounds to threaten divorce.  How can a man be honest when if he says something the wife doesn't like, she'll walk?  How can they have a true marriage when she's got him on the rack and she's turning the screws?  She needs to be told this, it's so out of line it's not funny.  Tell her to walk the walk.  In or out, get it over with.  Pick a side.  She's playing both sides, it's not on.<br>  <br>  PS:  she doesn't know what she's doing is out of line; it's all over telly, nobody will ever have told her she's doing anything wrong: but what she has done is so immensely maniuplative it warps the power base, gives her all the power.  And I bet she's complaining because he doesn't use power she thinks is his to use - she truly doesn't know she's stolen it and he doesn't have it any more.<br>  <br>  Did I make ANY sense to you above, or was I totally, totally obscure?  Erk.  What I say is true, it's just people don't often say it....<br>  <br>  Good luck.  And remember this: you get to walk out on them one day, and leave them in their own poo puddle.  Never forget this: you get to leave, and do better than them.  Watch them like a science experiment if you can't fix them - learn not to be like them, but also not to be the absolute opposite of them.  And also: it's really hard living with a man who is not sensitive, one does want to walk:  she only said what she was thinking, probably felt it was a warning rather than a threat, didn't see it from his end.  I don't know which of your parents needs a thick ear, possibly just bang their heads together and let them sort it out.<br>  <br>  bye again!|`|Nigyj6Sjaa	BEEN THEY JUST IGNORE THEM..TRUST ME IT WORK <br>  DON'T BECOME DEPRESSED ABOUT IT CAUSE IT NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU ..<br>  ALL YOU HAVE TO IS IGNORE ..I GOT IN WHEN MY PARENT WERE FIGTHING AND IT MADE IT WORST <br>  JUST PUT YOUR EARPHONE ON AND IGNORE|`|QsMOikN6aa	tell them to stop fighting for a stupid reason o.o?(well,if it is stupid)|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	I think you should tell them how their conflicts and fighting are making you feel, but make sure you have all those thoughts written down and that you have thought about them before raising this issue with them. Use sentences like.... I feel and I don't, just keep it about your feelings and don't use sentences that are accusing because this is about you and how you feel not how they feel.  For instance I would say something like this...... Mom and Dad I feel scared about who I would have to share a life with and what will happen, worried about the changes that could happen and if I will be okay, Insecure about our security as a family and other influences (aka, step parents and their children). Try to use adjectives to help them visualize and understand how you feel about their arguing <br>  I wouldn't recommend bringing this up during an argument or right after, Please wait until they are...... well not expecting it. The reason why I'm telling you to wait is because by waiting you will have them at your advantage and not when they are already angry and perhaps could direct their anger towards you, but honestly they won't mean it.

But your family has a valid reason for concern.  <br>  <br>  My advice is that you guys have a nice long engagement -- like 5 years.  Stay committed to each other, but finish high school and college.  Get your careers started.  You will change a lot in 5 years -- but the good news is, you will still only be 22 then.  If you still love each other then, then by all means, get married.  If you lay this plan out for your family and stick with it, I bet they won't be nearly as mad.  How could they be?  You would be showing a lot of maturity and an ability to plan for the long-term..|`|AaoclPYCaa	There is no way 17 year old kids are ready to get married.  A good marriage takes a lot of learned skill.  You have to know how to compromise, to deal with difficult decisions, and that takes a lot of maturity.  You are not ready.  How are you going to support her?  Is she going to work?  How does she feel about kids?  Do you have any parenting skills?  Do you know how to budget your money?  Marriage is not all fun and it takes a lot of skill to make it work.  Take some time and go to school.   Take some pre-marital classes that should help some.

If he is too shy, any of the groomsmen, or one of your bridesmaids can do it also.  The purpose is for someone who has known you BOTH the longest and can be sentimental without being embarrassing about it.  This is not the time for someone to start telling about the spring break to Daytona Beach and you spent the night in the drunk tank!<br>  <br>  You don't have to have some one walk you down the aisle.  Your Mother can, an older brother, or an Uncle.  You can also walk all by yourself in honor of your Dad and remember him by having a special table set off to the side with a candle lit for him and the flower that he would have worn.<br>  <br>  For all the rest; get yourself  a copy of Brides Magazine.  It will become your most prized possession when it comes to who pays for what, what you do in what order, etc.  They run about $12.99, but they are worth every penny and you will only need one!

Flower girls are typically ages 4 - 10, and 10 is probably pushing it.

ix5Wmhy0aa	That's really awful :(<br>  Most people that act like that are just jealous of others and need to get a life. As bad as it sounds, sometimes the best way to resolve it is just to ignore what they have done to you and make everyone think that it doesn't bother you. It'll seem hard and horrible at the moment, but it's just who they are. They do it because they want a reaction from you.<br>  <br>  If you ignore it then soon they will get bored and move onto someone else. Plus at the moment it may seem like everyone is on their side, but it won't take long before they forget and move one to something or someone else, and then it will most likely never be brought up again.<br>  <br>  I have been in similar situations, and I know it sucks. But trust me, it will all blow over soon, and loadssss of them will feel the same about older guys.  <br>  <br>  One day these girls will be nasty to the wrong person, and they will regret it. Plus, they won't get far in life if they behave like that, whereas you will.<br>  <br>  Try not to let it bother you too much, and I think you need to talk to your friend about this. She should /not/ have told them, and it is definatly /not/ how a best friend should act. Maybe you should find someone more trustworthy to tell your secrets to, and not tell her this sort of thing in the future. She really hasn't been fair to you and you deserve better.<br>  <br>  <br>  If this helped at all, could you please spare a vote for my school? <br>  The details are here:<br>  <a href="http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.html" rel="nofollow">http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.h...</a><br>  <br>  It'll only take a few seconds and would help me so much!<br>  Thanks x|`|uhRKCb9kaa	well how much you will show them that they are making you cry they will do the same thing again and again, so its your life let them do what they want to and what wrong if you like someone, its a natural thing.|`|byLLuAoMaa	Because they are complete dicks with nothing else to do with their pathetic lives. <br>  <br>  Let them get on with it, there's much nicer people out there for you!<br>  Don't care what they think!<br>  good luck xx|`|87b337eb3d3c35cc3b892f0d2d35232baa	they are losers find a nice guy and then hang out with him<br>  <br>  <br>  help me pls<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoZmb9DfX4kAyRE1REKfX.Xsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222114457AAZ1vc5">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|hPkWZh3xaa	People do that because they can get a laugh out of it, and they are more concerned about getting a laugh than how it makes the person feel.  People are selfish, so you kind of have to keep it to yourself who you fancy most of the time. It will blow over soon and they will be on to the next joke about someone else, so just grit your teeth and wait for it to blow over.  In this sad world where everyone is out for themselves you need to keep feelings private sometimes.  When you are older you will find people you can trust, when your peers are older and more mature.

This is her third marriage and only a couple people were invited as witnesses.  My grandpa was upset that she wasn't married by a minister.  There was never another ceremony later where more family was invited.  She wore a business suit and so did her husband.  They are still married and it's been around 10 years.  I think her first and second marriage were in a church, with family around, and a minister present.<br>  <br>  People can have a small wedding with family and it doesn't need to be an expensive event.  Marriage is about love and commitment.  It's great to share the time with family and friends.|`|AA12357988	We got married by a JP, in a regular style wedding.  We used an historic, no longer used for religion chapel, and had a reception.  I know plenty of people who have used a JP, either because they weren't religious, or didn't have a large wedding.   It worked out just fine.  The link below will tell you what you need to get a marriage license.|`|B12E4rYiaa	I got married twice by the JP due to being young and stupid.

MWjNp6y3aa	Take him out for dinner and a movie...this way you and him get to go on a date and he gets to spend his birthday with a wonderful girl. Maybe something along the lines of the Banksy thing. Don't get him Banksy stuff but something along the same lines. He sounds like a cool guy. At least to see the neatness of Banksy. Buy him a book of really cool art stuff. Maybe something like the guy that draws 3d chalk drawings on sidewalks. Then there is another person that does that same kind of awesome stuff on buildings. Heck make him a book. Print out pictures of that neat stuff in a good format. You can even get books bound on cafepress.com. Hell that would be one awesome present. They are pretty cheap.

But if you like it, I love it. I think I saw someone do it on tv or heard about it or something of the like. Doesn't really sound appealing. Maybe instead of ON the slopes, get married in a lodge NEAR the slopes, or with a VIEW of the slopes. Much more comfortable for the guests and everyone involved.

I guess you're not aware that "centuries," (plural) means at least 200 years...<br>  Maybe you meant decades...?<br>  <br>  I could more understand the generalization that, "People who spend hundreds of thousands on their wedding only care about throwing a big party, and are probably shallow and not truly in love," but it's never smart to make super generalized statements like that, because you can't be 100% right about every person in that situation.|`|XBYiHaWIaa	Yeah like what he said.|`|x2GQ8n6Oaa	Well at the end of the day it depends what's more important to you - money or love?<br>  <br>  The main thing is the reason why you were married in the first place, because you made a committment to one another that when things do go pear-shaped and you don't see eye to eye, that you sit down, talk through things and try to reach a compromise for your family's sake.<br>  <br>  And the most important thing of the day is being there and being joined to the person you love - not how much the dress cost etc...........if you're having a reception there's a certain amount to spend there feeding your guests en al, but you don't need to go overboard with it.  <br>  <br>  (btw not everyone who has had an expensive wedding is heading towards the divorce court so I think you're generalising a little, but I do get your point!)|`|L6DZZ6SJaa	Considering "thousands" means $2,000 plus, and the average wedding in the country costs about $30,000, you are pretty much insulting 98% of the people that read these. And honestly, no I have not noticed that. Those people in "My Big Redneck Wedding" who spend $30 on renting a dress and have a potluck with mud-pits for about $200 always seem really secure in their maturity and commitment to marriage.... ya... those people have the idea right! please.|`|185431bf2d462938a17318fe8510b2c0aa	yes i can agree with that.<br>  where i used to work another member of staff got married a few months after me,<br>  she spent three times the amount i did on her wedding and<br>  A, it was very tacky apparently<br>  B, she was a miserable cow all day<br>  C, she is only marrying the guy for his money as she was going to break up with him the day she got engaged!!<br>  <br>  so i give that relationship 2 more years<br>  so yes i agree- people obviously have to compensate being unhappy by spending loads of money|`|wdaoaa1gaa	what a terrible generalized question is this.

I also know many people who got married at a court house because they can't afford anything more than that and last a long time too.|`|wKCgaoZVaa	I think its because its much more special and sentimal, they're doing it for the right reasons. Tons of brides get caught up in the idea of a big white wedding, and then once the wedding is over they get bored.|`|tvUAO4ioaa	The only way I can see any logic in your POV is that a lot of second weddings are much less expensive and second marriages tend to last longer because they happen later in life when people know themselves better.|`|lP04jzv6aa	I think your wedding is your own. do what you want. your job is to fall in love with that person everyday. that's it.|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	Because a wedding does not make a marriage.

It doesn't come with any guarantees|`|S1D2PGmYaa	Maybe there's some truth in that, but my friend is getting divorced and she spent less on hers than my other friends. A wedding doesn't make a marriage.|`|fc76816ec74874b1d44f6e87125ce2baaa	What a load of rubbish.... and fyi I dont know of anyone who has been alive for 'centuries' let alone married for that long.|`|5QYvkdhJaa	Do you have statistics|`|4POGapREaa	That's far too general of a statement.  There are no statistics that suggest a marriage will fail or survive based on how much money they spent on their wedding.|`|nqINitkmaa	Sure that's the case for some, there are some people who spend very little and don't last either. My parents spent $15k (27 years ago) and celebrated their 27th wedding anniversary last week. My future in-laws had a very large expensive wedding and they have been married for 34 years. My sister spent quite I bit on her wedding and she has been married for 12 years, and she has a very happy marriage. Your just generalizing, and that's not fair. So in answer to you question, No I have not noticed that people who spend thousands on getting married never last, I know many who have. In fact I don't know anyone personally that has spent thousands on a wedding and ended in divorce.|`|BUET39wmaa	lol<br>  do you know that 55% of marriages end period?<br>  no matter what their wedding was like?|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	Nope, never noticed that.  In fact, the sibling that had a inexpensive wedding is the only one to be divorced in our family (and I mean, ever divorced).  My friends all had nice weddings, and they've been married between 20 and 25 years.  I don't know a lot of divorced people, but of those I do, I'd say two-thirds had inexpensive weddings.<br>  <br>  Any fool knows the marriage doesn't depend on how much you spent on the wedding.  It depends on your compatibility, your willingness to work out problems, communicating well, being tolerant and patient, knowing and understanding each other well, and all that stuff.  It's not about the wedding day.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	not nescesarily true.  my cousin and her husband spent god knows what on their wedding (it was alot though, trust me) but they have been married for 14 years now, have four beautiful children, and a wonderful home.  we see them all the time at family gatherings (my family gets together for EVERYTHING) and i dont even recall the last time i saw them fight or even heard of them having even a tiny argument|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	No, not true at all, in my experience with our marriage, and with family and friends.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	I am unaware of any major statistic on the amount spent on marriage correlating with divorce.<br>  <br>  There are lots of other statistics that are more important-like age at first marriage and education level of people getting married.<br>  <br>  Some people have money. Some people don't. That's just how the world works.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	You are over-generalizing. The amount of money someone spends has nothing to do with whether they are faithful and compatible or not. In general, what you are describing would appear to be true for alot of folks but that is not the case for everyone as you can see happen all the time.|`|oXfvBdNHaa	That is bull. What people spend on a wedding has nothing to do with their love! My parents are paying for everything and it will be nice. That has nothing to do with how successful my marriage is! And people who don't have squat, are no more in love than I am, just because they didn't go to college or work hard. That's a bunch of bull,|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	Not true. I married my first husband in a bar(no venue cost). I wore jeans and a white blouse, he wore jeans and a dark shirt(no dress/tux fees). My grandmother married us(no fees there). We did not even have rings until we had been married for almost 6 months. This was in July 1992. He left (for the second and last time) the week before Christmas 1996 when our daughter was 16 months old.<br>  I married my second husband in 2000. The wedding was huge compared but still modest...We spent about $6K but I did everything myself or with the help of friends...so basically we had what some would have spent $15K at least for. He went to prison less than 3 years later and I immediately filed for divorce.|`|AA11447210	Actually, it works both ways. The price of the wedding doesn't indicate how long the marriage will last.<br>  <br>  I've been married twice. My more expensive one lasted longer than the one what was informal, only 2 friends to stand up for us, and no reception.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	Not always but i think a lot of people (especially brides, cause it's what some DREAM about) put too much focus on the wedding (the event) and not the marriage (what's suppose to be the rest of your life)|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I don't think thats true.  I think people who spend thousands on their wedding and then get divorced kick themselves in the butt twice as hard though!|`|AA10378447	Nope. Not always true. You can't generalize like that, because it works out both ways.<br>  <br>  Stop hating.

Maybe you were better that way. Also you just need to give him some space to let him get used to being just friends again. Believe me, it will turn out alright.|`|jJ152e8Iaa	That is why i never date my best friends. In fact, that is why im never friends with any guys. At least not THAT close. You lose friendship and then lose a friend. Not worth it. You have to remember, after high school, everyone will go there separate ways. Soo if you wanna see it like how i did,  High school love is just a way to prepare you for the real thing, after high school.<br>  <br>  If you want, man up... (woman up lol) and talk to him and tell him you have been feeling very uncomfortable and if there is a chance you guys can really be friend or not.<br>  <br>  How to be friends? talk about thwe weather, space, rumor **** around, START rumors, talke **** about teachers, homeworks sucks, lunch food is poisoned, talk about movies, that is what me and my bf do, we keep our relationship serious but everyone thinks we are best friends lol thats the key of keeping a healthy relationship, being friends to each other.  You have so much stuff to talk about as friends. You can talk about cars!, all these subjects is what i talk to my bf about almost everyday, We have a pet turtle togther, as if it were our son lol (sounds weird i know) but im testing him, if i wanna have a kid with him i wanna see how well he takes care of that turtle, he doesnt know i got a turtle for that reason though soo shhhh ;D lol <br>  <br>  I hope i helped, if so, please vote for my answer to be "best answer" thank you!!!|`|CkpzuduCaa	well yes if you asked him i want to be your friend.|`|AA12260791	its hard going out with your best friend...it causes alot of problem. Dont seem to desperate to always talk to him cuz it obviously didnt work going out so it may seem awkward for a while just give it time.|`|b3Jb9EBsaa	don't push it i think that you will still be Friends after you give it some time to make it less awkward =]|`|w4XbSuB5aa	Thats y u should never date your best friends! u may break up and never talk to eachother again! it may always be like this.
aY6EjDwjaa	hey buddy, im 16 too and had a similar problem last year<br>  simple solution<br>  TELL HER<br>  tell her you dont like being treated like a child, and telll her you're going to the prom, and if she takes the piss, tell her she's immature.<br>  if you get a gf bring her on home, and just tell your mum you want your privacy.<br>  failing that move out<br>  soon as<br>  :D|`|icC8xHRhaa	well, you need to talk it out with her.    maybe you could sit her down and talk about your feelings with her and tak it out.  she needs to know how you really feel. ur almost 17 and you can take care of your self!  you have to stand up for yourself.  if she doesnt understand at the time, talk to her at a time when she is in a good mood.  i really hope everything will work out for you! :)|`|MBI4wp4faa	maybe you should try talking to her and telling her what you feel. <br>  i think she will understand but always try to remeber to moms your always going to be there little baby. but still i think you guys should talk it out and try to make some boundries on what your mom tells other ppl about your personaly life|`|jqsu76T5aa	well you let her treat u like that<br>  if once you sit and talk to her and tell her how you really feel and that u are embarrassed trust me shell understand how you feel.<br>  Tell her all that and she will deff feel guilty=]<br>  <br>  but hay dont miss the PROM!.<br>  <br>  enjoy.|`|GiEinn85aa	We think that our parents are embarrassing us but guess what, they think that we are embarrassing them. Thats why your mom is always doing these things behind your back so she can embarrass you before you can embarrass her.|`|Z6CxgQPEaa	Aside from running away, the only way to solve your problem is to talk to her. Hopefully she doesn't make fun of you for being open with her.|`|AA11614460	um. chances are your mums not about to change... perhaps just join some extra curricular activities that would allow you to be away from the house more often for a legitimate reason? and maybe youll find a girl there... :)|`|VGN1dB81aa	think u need to tell her how u feel.this kinda thing can screw a guy up|`|HzF1Frdoaa	i think maybe you should just explain to her that you want to be treat like a 17 year old not a 7 year old. and if she doesn't take it seriously you need to explain it to her that you are serious and that you need privacy and you want to be taken seriously as a person.|`|I8jbHEtCaa	OMG I FEEL YOUR PAIN!!!<br>  <br>  you have literally just described my situation..<br>  <br>  edit-<br>  <br>  okay, my mom is the same with me, at one point i literally ranted at her and it had zero effect. The best thing to do in my opinion is ignore her completely all the time. When she asks whats wrong say this;<br>  <br>  'I can't tell you, you wont understand'<br>  <br>  then she should take it more seriously.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|iVauFFkSaa	just talk to your mom and tell her how you feel, tell her that ur not a kid any more but say that with respect dont say it with attitude.<br>   or speak to ur dad about it <br>    i am here to help u if my advice dont work ask me again i will help with this i know how u feel im 16 too|`|BNAptFIYaa	u really need to sit her down and talk to her bout everything, cause my mom used to do it to me to and i hated it|`|369Plo3paa	XD That sounds like a frustrating problem. Moms can be weird sometimes, very weird. She probably means for the best, but doesn't know how to handle the fact that her cute little baby has now turned into the beginnings of a young man. I do have something that might help. She probably pesters you so much because she gets a reaction out of you. Try to keep from over reacting and somehow shift her attention, like... Start talking about something intellectual until she gets bored and leaves you alone.|`|VpTUFKXiaa	i woud sit your mom down and talk to her..act serious and say "mom i wanna talk to you" and explain how you want to be treated more like an adult and ask for her help on that. If she is your mother and cares about you, then she should step up to stop. Also, remember to mention tha when she does something embarrassing again, remind her gently but if it keeps going constantly, get more serious about reminding her about your discussion. Hope this helps and good luck!|`|bCwofEL1aa	I'm about your same age, and I had a similar problem to yours..including myself, it's a family of 5, and my two other siblings are much closer to my mom than I'll ever be. That being said, I get talked about behind my back all the time by them, and I realized I couldn't really do anything to stop it..so I just ignore it. I know it might be annoying, but you shouldn't ponder on such pointless things..it seems like your life at home really has your mind way too occupied, and I think you should try to get out of your house as much as possible, and be with your friends more. don't worry about being embarassed if you invite them over, your friends will understand that parents are lame, and retarded, and are living in the past, so don't worry about it..and as for the girlfriend situation: just go for it. don't ever let anybody (not your friends OR your family) stop you from doing what you what, and being with who you want to be with.|`|nUuK9Aglaa	haha, wow, it's funny, because i feel the same way. and i call her mum too:p. yeah. the best thing to do is just say, "mum, i don't know why you treat me like a child, i really need a little more privacy. please consider also not telling everybody in the family about my personal life."<br>  <br>  i don't really know what else to tell you:/<br>  but good luck. could you please choose me as best answer?<br>  i really need the points:(|`|w9rd1biRaa	dude, i understands but i know  how to handle this, do smthing that proves ur ability as a teenager e.g. <br>  1. u alone go market and buy all the household things, <br>  2. talk her about the political affaairs of ur country that will affect ur mom's thought that my child is young enough to understand politics,<br>  3. watch channels that only meant for adults in front of ur mother that will also help in change her mentlity <br>  4. best way talk to her abt ur problem.<br>  <br>                                *****::::BEST OF LUCK::::*****<br>  forgive me for the things u don't like <br>  and my english is not so good coz i m from india|`|oLhAi73caa	Difficult parents.. well you know for when you have kids. <br>  <br>  You need to start communicating with your mum more, I presume your the oldest child in the family. So its her first teenager?? She doesn't know what to do, how to treat you or what to say.... so she treats you like a child. <br>  <br>  To resolve this you need to guide her, get her to chat to other parents. But first, sit her down and explain how you feel, tell her your not a child anymore and deserve to be treated like an adult. Tell her its how you feel. But don't be agressive, she will not listen. <br>  <br>  Parents also always feel the need to discuss, and it doesn't sound like your dads around, so she talks to the family (its a female thing). Women by evolution always want to talk about things, express their emotions. So its completely normal, and I can imagine most mums do it. <br>  <br>  She does sound a little lost, so take my advice and guide her, help her for when the next teen comes along (little sis). <br>  <br>  Good luck :D|`|pb7qPJcxaa	There is more to this story.  Do you wear underoos or nappies to bed?  Maybe that's why mummy still talks babby talk to you.|`|BPNAcSpVaa	You should have a heart to heart with her. She is just being a mom though. I know it could be hard, but it seems like she is a good mom to you. ask her if you have permission to go out after prom, but have a curfew, negotiate with her. Ask her to give you a chance to act your age responsibly, maybe it will lead to a more mature relationship rather than a childish one.|`|AA11154080	i have the same problem. just show them you can handle responsibility, then dont be scared to break the rules...you'll be seriously get into trouble but after a while they'll get use it and you'll give them the impression your not a lil boy anymore hehe|`|agcSrV75aa	you could try talking to her, maybe she doesn't realise shes imbarrasing you, you know hw parents are, theyre totally oblivious lol let her know how u feel, and be serious about it then she cant laugh it off and she'l have to listn to u<br>  <br>  good luck with whatever u decide 2 do ^_^|`|v0596BTeaa	You are a child, you live in your mum's house, you are acting like a child in moaning about how your mum behaves.  Put up with it until you are old enough to leave.
IJCraYubaa	Knock down you house.. they wont want it anymore(:<br>  and ill help got plenty of tools<br>  <br>  and i already know and im sad too <br>  <br>  love you forever and ever <br>  <br>  sarah?|`|04F4149yaa	Aww, honey! It will be alright. Just gotta say it to their faces. It's okay to cry okay? XD Don't worry, you will be able to visit them over breaks and stuff. Also, you will make new friends. Don't be scared. Be confident.
U8oR3VU6aa	Kind of the same situation but we resolved it by letting the stepmom light one of them. She stood beside and a bit behind the Mom and when it came to the last taper Mom gave the lighter to the stepmom. It worked out fine and everyone was included and no one felt slighted.|`|gXBPLitzaa	Find something for her to do anything. <br>  Anything no matter how lil she will love being involved somehow.|`|ahDBFy8Haa	i personally think girls shall never be involved with life and done so like they ******* are in afghanistan|`|5uSgleTKaa	add details and i may be able to help

No offense intended,  but that is just how you sound by your question.|`|aSvOaAjiaa	She will have found herself another guy|`|FHQZz8dNaa	Being a girl, I would want my space and I wouldn't like over clingy guys. Just back off, she' s probobly busy with school, family, etc. Let her txt you first, but try txting her at least once every now and then to show her you care. Just don't over do it, don't worry it is nothing!|`|DHJmSv2Yaa	i think you are doing the right thing. it is probally just she is extra busy just give her some space. she hasnt forgotten about you and if she continues to do so again next week confront her about. im sure she wiull be very understanding|`|meKSppblaa	I wouldn't worry. Shes just busy. You cant go crazy thinking about it. I get so paranoid about my boyfriend. Like when he does not call me or something.|`|AA11261740	LOl<br>  ah.......has the little girl forgotten you? Hey, perhaps that fact that you ahven't been text........is actually a TEXT...meaning....bye bye Joe...<br>  or as they say: get over it........
L6DZZ6SJaa	I would not buy that online, to be honest. With wedding bands, it's important to make sure the wedding band fits correctly with your engagement ring - you will have to try it on for that. With the way the economy is, a lot of jewelers are going out of business or having huge sales. I would call around and see who has sales and then take a whole weekend, or a couple random days, and hit all the stores you can find sales at to find a band that fits well and is a good price. Also, don't forget you can always negotiate the prices of rings/jewelry. Don't pay sticker price - you should be able to get at least 15-20% off (if not more) with good negotiations! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4POGapREaa	Sure.  This is where I got mine.

xDdhUldraa	Hmmm, get your combination changed.  To me though, it sounds like the family sans your dad are all concerned.  Your dad might have found a drinking friend but I doubt it.  BUT, if you are Truly concerned, then have the person in charge of the house hold ask him to stop coming around.  Before you do this though, ask for a family meeting to make sure everyone feels the same way and it is not just a group mentality thing.  Gert your phone number changed and get a dog.  Should stop some of the issues.  You don't have to OWN a dog though, ask your friends or neighbors to borrow their pet for a few days and see if that helps.  Sounds as if you are not in the US so you would have to check your local police enforcement shop and see what the harassment laws are all about before you take too drastic of action.|`|AA11066099	Tell your dad to do his duty and send him on his way!x|`|jwftwLBTaa	I somehow do not understand what you are trying to say and ask. slow down and try again.
1UiYpUWiaa	2 cheap internet cameras and an online video chat room or some video communication software, exchange email address and your set.<br>  yeah its not going to be the same but you'll move on eventually, saying goodbye to your best friends is something everyone has to do sooner or later.|`|7xnMr6zVaa	that best thing u can do before he leave ask him for his email address and u can add him then u can talk there...|`|id6yx9neaa	Why is he moving to Mexico?<br>  If possible, convince him not to move to mexico..<br>  but if it is really important..<br>  let him go..<br>  even if it's hard.. :(<br>  i know what you feel.|`|AA12260791	CAN YALL E-MAIL EACH OTHER?

rVLolY7raa	Yes it is wrong, just tell your mom and her friend the free ride is over.|`|mYmR5cX5aa	You are not being unreasonable. She should of bought you all meals instead of just her kids in this case. <br>  The only way this is going to get better is for you to straight out tell your mom that you do not like being taken advantage of this way, and that you will no longer babysit unless a certain rate of pay is paid upfront. Tell the mother of these children the same message. You will not be too popular, but if you do not correct this now, you will become a doormat for anyone else in your life. Set the message loud and clear and set the boundaries. <br>  Your mom allows this to happen because she cannot say no to her friend either.|`|1UiYpUWiaa	so your 15 and taking care of misbehave kids that aren't family as well as your siblings  every day and not getting payed?<br>  people need to take care of their own kids or at least pay someone to do so, talk to your mother but watch how you say it, no yelling no coursing no anger just put it down like you want it and reach a deal.|`|Npr6EvOjaa	if your mom's not home, turn off all the lights when her friend comes and don't answer the door. keep doing it and she'll get the point ;)|`|gktbI6dEaa	when she comes just say "sorry got plans, I have to leave.."it is not right what she is doing. Just stand up to her and say no.|`|AA12260791	HAHA...NICE CHOICE OF WORDS. WELL NEXT TIME DONT REALLY WATCH THEM AND THEY WILL TELL THERE MOM THAT YOUR NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THEM SO SHE MAY FIND SOMEONE ELSE. AND ABOUT THE FOOD, TELL THE KIDS TO SHARE AND IF THEY DONT THEN JUST DONT LET THEM EAT IT SO THEY WILL TELL THERE MOM AND THE MOM WILL RECONSIDER YOU WATCHING HER KIDS|`|v8BqdUHWaa	no big deal in you helping her,cos shes your mom's friend.is jst dat she made a mistake, she ought to buy smthing 4 you too at least coz u're so kind 2 her by taking care of her siblings|`|9QKqs2zNaa	play metallica's black album & you will find the answer
EdDLydH7aa	awww that's so sweet of you, i think they have general get well cards that aren't too mushy, considering it's for an ex's family member they have lots of cool cards like that at like halmark or even walmart for that matter, you just have to look, and i love to read cards so i can spend all day doing it so i know they have some...good luck to you and hope your friends are well....
zzUgYFy4aa	no that is not true at all ... seems like you are throwing all women in one little box and that is not fair at all.. the girls that you encounter are like that ((sorry)) but not ALL girls!!!
aMqYdO0vaa	I think "Jasmine" is desperately starved for attention. As a  best friend you need to tell her what she is doing is wrong. Ask her to come over and talk it out. Say something to this effect: "Look your my best friend and I love you but you are making a fool out of yourself. You are acting perverted,stalking guys,and you are way to into yourself. You need to stop before something bad happens. Im doing this because I care for you." She can either take your advice or keep on going down the same path shes on, but that does not mean you need to go down with her. If shes to caught up with her self and boys shes going to end up a high school drop out,pregnant and no friends. Make wise decsions :)|`|AA12260791	DONT GIVE UP TO FAST YOU HAVE A FEW OPTIONS...<br>  <br>  1. TELL HER HOW YOU FEEL...IF SHE DOESNT UNDERSTAND THEN SAY OKAY I CANT TAKE THIS! I CANT BE YOUR FRIEND IF YOUR GOING TO ACT LIKE THIS, SO IF YOUR GONNA CHANGE THEN COME TELL ME<br>  <br>  2. DONT HANG OUT WITH HER FOR AWHILE THEN GO BACK TO HER AND SEE IF YOU SEE ANY CHANGE IN HER.|`|AA10471068	This is a stage that a lot of young ladies and young men tend to go through. Young ladies have it especially hard for they tend to feel more neglected at home.  While most youth have a short time when they seem to become obsessed with the opposite sex it eventually comes to an end. I agree with some of the other writers who have suggested you talk to her. DO NOT come on holier than thou, though. Tell her that as a friend who are concerned about how she's acting and the signals she may be sending out that she's unaware of.  Let her know that you care about her and don't want her to get a reputation that she doesn't deserve.|`|64oOqELCaa	its probably just a stage or mabe its her period you never know well me and my best friend have been best friends for nine years and everytime we see eachother we have these itty bitty fights and i wait till she caves in then were friends again just say u miss the old her and if she really loves yuo maybe she will change|`|gEci0xCaaa	Don't give up! My friend use to get on my nervez alot and I told her I i felt about it .......... and well it work!
76nTvO4iaa	If their intentions were honorable (meaning they really were trying to help), you can't be too mad at them.  If they intentionally sabotaged things, that would be a friendship ender for me.<br>  <br>  The moral of the story is not to rely on others to help you with your relationships.  Take care of things yourself, because the more people who get involved, the greater chance there is for misunderstandings and miscommunication.<br>  <br>  ((hug))|`|9pDEhA1Xaa	Need to know what your talking about.  This sound serious!|`|zVjCUUAmaa	sit them down and talk about it since they had good intentions<br>  <br>  it also depends on what you mean by 'ruined your life'. did it really destroy your life or are you just overexaggerating?|`|N8W0ADnraa	I would probably kick his butt out of my feeling. I would feel disapointed. What happen? You had someone like that in your life?|`|YGYMocGRaa	happened to me. thats why i solve ,my own problems now|`|lP04jzv6aa	depends on the  who, what and why......|`|b53k0EZkaa	well i ruined someones life on purpose and she is coming back =[ just gunna have to ruin it again and shes all commenting me on my myspace pictaas and facebook pictaasss and is all like super cute i whish i was you! and im like plz girl...and yah but im just a ***** so i dontt knwo why she is forgiving me or w.e but that person was suposed to help you....they prob feel SUPER bad so give em a break and try to make things better|`|6rwwDlMqaa	i guess i would be grateful for the help but i wouldnt ask them again|`|iVauFFkSaa	i would feel bad and depressed but u can change ur life around its never too late
Wf8PbTraaa	well her being mad at you is one thing but her trying to take away all your other friends is another thing.<br>  <br>  don't try to be friends with someone like that. just move on.|`|mikgNjTZaa	dont be friends with that person shes not right for taing your friends <br>  like get new ones
S4QBvAaGaa	You might ba able to do a few things:<br>  1) Avoid talking about hair. <br>  2) If you do talk about hair, try and show the bright side of your type of hair. Point out some good things about it and who are some people that wear it well, or make it their signature style.<br>  3) Tell her you find it offensive when she says stuff like that and ask her to stop.<br>  4) Stop being friends. Become associates or nothing else if it's worth it.<br>  Good Luck! :)|`|WiFVIq3Iaa	tell him about it|`|sNXpyhhfaa	just tell her thats not cool and stop hating on your hair cuz u actually like it and u find it annoying when she does that just communicate with her better! :)
oKrNOazLaa	either she is lesbian or just too shy to start a conversation, hope you the best and nice job at keeping honors! :)|`|jqsu76T5aa	shes jealous of you.
lTNcvqyHaa	Yes, you were used.<br>  Yes, you did do the right thing by not following the crowd.<br>  Yes, you are a good friend, and she knows knows it and so do her parents - they trust you.<br>  <br>  Yes, you did do the right thing by calling your Dad.<br>  <br>  I have 2 beautiful daughters, and both have been invited to parties that turned out to be partee's - both had good reason to call us up and pick them up. <br>  <br>  Life is what you make it - she is a silly girl trying to chase the crowd. You know you are a strong heart with good morals - I am sure your parents love and respect and trust you more. Good on you sweetheart!!!|`|hm4oU8bDaa	You did the right thing to not hang out with those people. Your friend is probably not using you, she probably just thought you wanted to have fun. But with the drinking part, tell her you don't do that. You would of liked to stay with her at the gathering you went to, but you didn't want to drink with her.|`|kMeUwwp8aa	It happens. But you must ask your best friend first. You won't lose anything out of being honest with each other. Talk 2 her and tell her that you felt bad about it and you don't want that to happen again. If she's really your best friend, she'll listen and understand. My cousin always do that to me too just to let her dad give her permission to go out late at night. So what I did was tell her I was upset that she uses me. She realized what she did and she apologized. It never happened again.|`|ffdf225d9f6c6bf94ed4f57553ac0e7daa	Yes,<br>  most likely she did...<br>  why don't you ask her?|`|Y7DxQvreaa	No, listen to me, she didn't use you. If she'd used you she wouldn't have cared that you left. You said she got mad, right? That means she was hurt you didn't want to go with her.<br>  <br>  I did this sort of stupid stuff when I was your age and really a drinking party at 14 usually means a couple beers or wine coolers... whatever they can sneak from their parents over the week. <br>  <br>  I don't understand you people giving advice, it's like the whole world's a troll.|`|vZ6Ha4h6aa	you so were not doing the right thing. if she does not understand why you don't want to do that, then try and talk to her, if she still doesn't, then the friendship needs some work.

szX346DFaa	Awkward Turtle = During an awkward moment, this hand gesture is used to mark the situation as awkward, and, depending on the situation, makes it more awkward or clears the air. The awkward turtle is made by putting one hand on top of the other with the thumbs sticking outward and rotating forward. The speed of the rotating thumbs depends on the degree of awkwardness. <br>  <br>  Example: -<br>  Boy- "I love you." <br>  Girl- "Um...that's cool..." <br>  Boy- *AWKWARD TURTLE* <br>   <br>  Nope. Never done it before but i find it amusing if someone does that!
e5RFQtPGaa	Just do nice things for her and compliment her. And if she doesn't get the message by then or just doesn't bring it up, then most likely she's not interested. And if she's not interested then don't act like its the end of the world, you'll just find someone else. But the best girlfriends are the ones who are friends with you first. So just treat her like she's special, but don't go over the top. Good Luck! =)|`|AA12260791	Just talk to her and ask her out and if she denies its not cuz she doesnt like you, its probably cuz your younger, thats totally turns some ppl off but its worth a try.

Ed45jCoXaa	i'm not in college. But i don't lead to a lazy life. I'm a dancer which i love to dance a lot. Yesterday i went skiing with my school. I skii and water skii. I went sledding. I spent one day on the computer. The rest all at school. After school i will hang with friends at school or finish some homework i didn't do at school.
rulABcARaa	it was fine for you to be defensive for the people you work with! and they should not have been laughing at them but you must remeber they were all probably really really drunk and high on good spirits. dont stew on it because your going to get pent up on it and its worthleess. if you threw ice you probably did it somewhat aggresively and then he retaliated. he wil probably remeber what he did soon and will call and apologise. - if he doesnt - so what! hes a moron ,and anyone who can laugh about ausitic people [drunk or not] are really not worth anyones time!|`|Npr6EvOjaa	maybe you should confront your friend about it.|`|KdRjx7bCaa	you should be mad. your friend not only did the whole retarded thing even though he knows you hate this but he didnt stand up for you when the guy poored beer on you. you should tell him to not make fun of you like that because next time you wont take it.|`|zv01EjTLaa	That sounds like it would be very frustrating.  It is surprising that an entire group of friends would laugh as he poured beer on you.  Of course you shouldn't have thrown the ice.  Are you in your twenties?  Maybe you should get some new friends.  I wouldn't tolerate that behavior from my friends and neither should you.  the whole situation seems weird.  Maybe the jerk didn't know how to react when you threw the ice at him and he had already had a bad day................who knows.  You should be proud of helping autistic kids.|`|NTUr0t3haa	My feedback. You saw warning signs that the situation was getting out of hand and that you were the target. But you let it slide because they were drunk. Next time, leave immediately. Drunk people don't get any nicer over time. They get worse.<br>  <br>  Then it was a strategic error to provoke a drunken male, when you were outnumbered. Just leave next time.<br>  <br>  Your friend is an a.s.s. but since you're 20, it's now on you to decide when to exit bad scenes.
7LNDxIr4aa	Being "popular" isn't the most important thing. The most important thing is doing what will be best for you in the future, but staying happy in the meantime. That is what you should do to take care of yourself. Surround yourself with people who make you feel good about yourself and who you have fun with. Making friends isn't something you should have to try really hard to do. Be open, but not too open. Be ready to try new things but not things that make you feel too uncomfortable. Just talk with people around you. You don't necessarily have to start the conversation. <br>  Don't compromise your morals for something you think will make you popular. Drugs are stupid. They are seriously damaging your brain. Don't go to that level. Make a promise to yourself about that. Then follow through with it. School is important. It will ensure that you can support yourself in the future. <br>  You don't necessarily have to have "trendy" outfits. Try letting your hair be curly. Shopping is something I love sooo much. If you don't enjoy it you aren't going to be good at it or have fun with it. Determine your own style. In my opinion, seventh grade girls generally look cutest in like American Eagle. For you I suggest Delias, AE, Nordstrom, etc. Dress in whatever makes you feel good about yourself. If you don't have much money to spend, look for the sale. Bright colors look good on girls your age, but I love neutrals. Watch "What not to wear" on tlc if you want any help. Stacy and Clinton are great. If you are average weight (not too heavy) skinny jeans are adorable and very popular. If you are a heavy girl, trouser jeans will look good on you. Go for a dark wash either way. I think it makes you look more put together. Neutral or colorful cardigans look really young and cute. Don't "match" colors, but find colors that go well together. <br>  Go to a mirror, and look at youself. Decide on the thing that you love most about your physical appearance. It could be your eyes, or your skin, or anything. Focus on that one thing. Write it down if you want. The next time you look in a mirror, choose something else. In a week or so, you'll have a list of things you love about yourself. <br>  My best advice to make friends is to not be pushy, but be friendly. If your friends aren't making plans, then make some of your own and invite some people. <br>  My high school is great. It seriously isn't as scary as everyone makes it out to be. Being a teenager is supposed to be a great time in your life. Just have fun. There are going to be ups and downs. Just remember everyone goes through awkward phases, and you'll grow out of it and blossom. <br>  You seem like a really sweet girl. I'm sorry you aren't happy right now. If you want me to make you an outfit or something, email me. I'd be happy to help you with anything you need. <br>  I hope everything works out. Good luck. You're a cutie, don't worry.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just had a great idea: go onto polyvore (www.polyvore.com) and look up like "spring" or something. They have great stuff and there is so much variety. That is a great website. <br>  <br>  Also, try your best to not opt out of things you have been invited to because you are scared of being social. You may have a few awkward moments, but in the end you will have more fun.|`|UOpOt43oaa	One use repair shampoo to repair your hair and do not staighten it don't fight your hair that is a number one rule. Wat I can tell u is buy electric curlers there take 10 min and there will add a sexy volume to your hair that u will love.<br>  <br>  2) a) you don't need too know how to match for this option but it does depend on how much money u have buy brands such as hollister abercrombie billabong roxy zooyork hurley aeropastle and etc and just where with skinny jeans.<br>  B) look on website like wat not to wear or look on store websites and see wat is in find simalar things on sale in department stores and then add your own twist. <br>  Example: my signature accessory is guitar earings from claire's <br>  <br>  3) the best way to appear confident is to fake it act like yyou know wat u are doing walk with your head up shoulders back and smile never cross your arms either that puts people off. Also do something you could be good at<br>  Example: if you can write sing or play an Instrument put together a band or play solo for the talent show<br>  <br>  If your are flexible or small and can do flips try out for the cheerleading squad<br>  <br>  Also always wear foundation to even out your skin and just a hint of mascara to accent your eyes <br>  <br>  I hope I helped bye <br>  <br>  :)|`|fS5UkvkGaa	Okaaaay I am not an expert on hair but when I started straightening mine then the Barber gave me some stuff to spray on to protect it from the heat. I would go see a hairdresser and ask her (or his) advice.<br>  <br>  Clothes. I don't know what kind of background you come from but if you have some money then I would buy a set of clothes from a designer. If you have some but not enough for that then at least buy one thing from a designer and then try to mix it in with your clothes. If you need help with this look at the designers website and get some Ideas about what kind of stuff would go. If you can't really afford anything designer, go to a TJ Max and try to pick out some nice clothes (this may take several trips). Pick out your own style. You could for instance go for a denim look, skinny jeans, denim jacket and a black tight t-shirt looks really nice, or a hoodie and sweats or something. If you want to just pick stuff from your own clothes, look at some of the people around you and see if they are wearing anything like what you have. Just go for it girl! (P.s email me a picture of you if you can! Jammyd13@yahoo.com)<br>  <br>  Okay about feeling insecure. I am reasonably outgoing but not super popular or anything so I think I can give you some advice but not experience from your side. What I would do is talk to some of the people next to you in classes. Be friendly but relaxed, don't try too hard. You mentioned that you do have some friends. Try to get to know their other friends. Also DEFINITLEY when it comes to friends choose quality over quantity. Arrange to go into town with the friends you already have and suggest that they bring other friends as well.<br>   <br>  If you need any more help or have a query just email me.<br>  <br>  I HOPE THIS HELPS!!!
KA8KhNlgaa	maybe the person who dared u 2 to make out said that cuz maybe they know that the guy mite like u back... start hanging out with him a little more.. go to the movies or ask him to hang out with u and ur friends and ask him if he wants to bring another guy wit him too.. see how things go for a while as friends then see if u should go any further.. ask one of ur friends if it seems like its going well and see if he'll make the first move..or maybe u should... also talk to him a and start convos. this happened to me too.. i liked a guy i didn't know if he liked me we talked and hung out more and then he ended up asking me out... idk see what happens.. good luck!!|`|ACrRCmaIaa	Well the guy u used 2 go out with.........just say to him, u still hav feelings 4 him. Or just say to him that just because your not going out anymore, dosent mean u dnt still wanna b friends. After that take it further step by step.

Have more parties and hang out with them more often it always works. oh and you should try these flirting tips:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1. PUT OUT THE VIBE<br>  Just like you, guys get nervous about talking to a girl they like — especially if they think she’s unavailable or, worse, uninterested. So if you’re into a guy, give him a sign (and let him know you won’t laugh in his face) by making eye contact and flashing him a "go ahead, make your move" smile<br>  <br>  2. CHALLENGE HIM<br>  You know how fired up you get when you lose a round of Guitar Hero? Well, guys’ "I will not be defeated!" spirit can be even stronger. So get your crush’s competitive juices flowing by taking him on in a little one-on-one. Whether you win or lose, you’ll still be a champ in his eyes!<br>  <br>  <br>  3. BE SORT OF THERE FOR HIM<br>  Guys love the thrill of chasing what they think they can’t have. So let him wonder what you’re up to sometimes. Treat the amount of time you give him like cell phone minutes: Use sparingly at first and he’ll want more, more, more!<br>  <br>  4. DUCK, DUCK, GOOSE HIM!<br>  In elementary school, a guy with a crush was a pigtail’s worst nightmare. Now that you understand what his motives were then, it’s time for payback. Reach out to him with a childish punch or noogie and his inner 6-year-old will be forced to respond!<br>  <br>  5 GREAT PLACES TO MEET GUYS<br>  <br>  CONCERTS: He’s in a feel-good groove. And since you like the same music, he’s likely to groove with you!<br>  <br>  GAS STATIONS: Filling up is boring. Pass time by trying move #1 (eye contact!) on the guy two pumps over!<br>  <br>  VOLUNTEERING: With all the great karma that comes from doing good, you’re sure to make a connection.<br>  <br>  AMUSEMENT PARKS: Go in a group with an odd number — then ask a hot guy to sit with you on the Python!<br>  <br>  WAITING IN LINE: You’re both at the mercy of the slow barista at Starbucks.

I should think your friend must have upset her mum for her to do this.<br>  But if it was for something minor or is repeated often, it is abuse.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	It's legal but will dislodge brain cells|`|g10m67Luaa	NO, she shouldn't slap her kids...turn her over 2 the cops.|`|h59cFPS9aa	OMG ill never slap my son around the face - for me there's just no need for that i don't think its right, i don't claim to know all about parenting but i believe there's other forms of discipline for your kids then a slap across the face|`|d438e292469e980aac0cc310467ececfaa	it is not illegal as long as there are no marks and she only does it once.  however, I have seen women who do it and I think it is appalling.

Least according to my Mam!
MPbB0ri1aa	You do not say what general age group you are talking about here. Sounds like a crush, which can be normal in preteen and adolescence.<br>  <br>  Just to point out. Obsession is not love, it is being so wrapped up in your own feelings and getting what you want that object of your obsession is just that to you.... an object that you must have at all costs and not free will person.<br>  <br>  Your friend needs to take some time to figure out what exactly she finds she loves about him (this can be useful later). Are the reasons focused only on what she feels and gets in the relationship or are there other things that she admires about him as an individual? If he does not feel the same way about her, is she still willing to deal with her disappointment and move on from there?<br>  <br>  In mature relationships of any kind (friends, family, love, casual, etc.) there is open communication of feelings, desires, and expectations of that relationship. It would only be fair for her to be honest with him on how she feels (this is where the thinking things out time can be useful as she can tell him what it is about him that attracts her) and where she would like the relationship to go. Then she should accept and respect how he feels and wants. If he does not feel the same way, it can hurt. But if she can let him go and not try to cling on or change is mind, then she really cares about him as a free will person. If she keeps hanging on and not let him go, then she is being obsessive.|`|7LNDxIr4aa	I don't think she's being obsessive at all. Girls tend to get like that when they really like someone. Obsession is when it gets creepy. From what you've said, I don't think it has reached that point.|`|VaQC9Vctaa	No I don't think she's obsessive she just really likes him. We girls tend to get excited about a new guy we like.|`|ix5Wmhy0aa	To be honest, I think that if she is worried that she is obsessive then it probably means that she isn't, especially if she is worried about making him uncomfortable. More likely is that if she was obsessed she wouldn't realise it and would say that she wasn't.<br>  <br>  I agree with you. I think she is just in love with him, and I think she needs to be honest with him about how she feels if she wants anything to happen between them.<br>  <br>  <br>  If this helped at all, could you please spare a vote for my school? <br>  The details are here:<br>  <a href="http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.html" rel="nofollow">http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.h...</a><br>  <br>  It'll only take a few seconds and would help me so much!<br>  Thanks x|`|byLLuAoMaa	At least she is considering the fact that she may be obsessive. <br>  I also think that she likes him alottt. <br>  But I also think that she thinks this because she is scared of rejection... like a sort of excuse to like him... know what I mean?<br>  That sentence was a tongue twister lol :P|`|V6oPIVLZaa	She must really like him nothing wrong with that|`|PhKzejntaa	OBESSIVE! No doubt in my mind.|`|deZArjX7aa	It's definitely on the verge of obsessive. She needs to find a hobby to keep her busy and her mind off of him.<br>  <br>  Or, she could just tell him how she feels.
QGv8ngfeaa	Seriously- just go and say hi. Invite him to a part with a group, tell him to bring a friend. Try not to one-on-one him right away. <br>  <br>  Its not creepy, we all pick out certain vibes from people that either push us away or attract us.<br>  <br>  :)|`|bVnIL1KHaa	This (in my point of view) isn't creepy at all. You want to make a new friend and that's cool. The one thing that i would suggest however is to talk to him and not his best "bud". To get to know him, you could ask him to go to the movies or something with a group of your friends. that way if you guys don't really get along or have an awkward silence in your conversation, you can always have someone to fall back on.|`|2MZXQzRjaa	I don't think it's creepy. There are plenty of people that I would like to be friends with, but am too shy to talk to. If I was in his situation I would feel flattered, but that's just me..<br>  <br>  Do you have any classes with him? If you do, try sitting next to him (but don't make it look like you're eager to) and talking to him. Maybe smile at him after he gives a presentation (this is how I make friends at speech competitions). If he's near by and someones doing something annoying, try to make eye contact and roll your eyes (but only if you can tell that he finds it annoying, too).
7zrsIK9Paa	OMG i was in the EXACTT situation as you lol.<br>  seriously.<br>  My friend's boyfriend always calls me a chink just because i'm asian or something.He's always dissing me just for the fun of it and because he doesn't have a life and has nothing else to do. My best friend always agrees with him and laughs along with him.<br>  I got so pissed off. <br>  Well i'm not sure this is the right decision for you but this is exactly how i handled it:<br>  First i got some people by my side, i mean i have other amazing friends to support me. They started to diss my friend's boyfriend so that he can get a taste of his own medicine. Then when he wouldn't stop dissing me, i blocked his msn and started pretending that he didn't exist. Just ignore him even when he says anything. Pretend he doesn't exist. He'll eventually get bored and stop.<br>  And for your friend.. tell her how you feel. Tell her that if your her best friend she should understand how you feel. Boys come and go, friends last forever. If she doesn't listen.. then she's not worth being your best friend.. <br>  Alrite and now my best friend understood and told her boyfriend to stop.. Her boyfriend and i still ignore each other but at least i kept my best friend. And if he ever disses you, don't just stand there. Diss him back, be as harsh as you want to!
UIXKTaghaa	I'm assuming you are going to an organised murder mystery night, in which case have a word with the actors when you get there and ask them if they can improvise something for your friend to get her involved.  They might already plan to pick on someone during the evening to collapse on etc, and they could pick your friend.  Most of the murder mystery dinners are based on audience interaction and I'm sure they would happily include her.<br>  <br>  Other suggestions would be getting her some hen party props, or kidnapping her prior to the event and getting her dressed up in something outrageous.<br>  <br>  I got carried to my party on a bed (long story, we were needing to move a bed from one house to another, so everyone decided to do it with me on it!)  But you could get her to arrive in something she wouldn't naturally travel in.  Have you thought of hiring a limo to pick her up?  Or getting her there in a wheelchair, or shopping trolley.<br>  <br>  You could ask the hotel to bring her her pudding covered in sparklers or arrange for her to have a totally outrageous cocktail.  You might want to buy a table bomb (confetti etc inside) for your table - check with the hotel they are happy with this.  - also, you might want to ask the hotel to decorate your table with hen night props - you could supply them.  They are usually happy to accomodate requests.<br>  <br>  Get all your friends to buy a small gift that will remind her of you, it can be something very silly like a toothbrush, but should be something that has a story / meaning to it for each one of you, then wrap them all up and get her to open them on the night.  You should label each gift as why it is important and what you want her to think of as she uses it.<br>  <br>  Obtain some old photos of her as a child and put together an album, one picture for every year of her life.  Alternatively put together an album of her friendship with all of you.

Quite touching actually.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	if thats what your daughter wants then sure you can! many mums are doing just that and it is totally appropriate that the parent who has raised her, loved her, and supported her, should be the one to have that special honor!|`|cdL4wzGbaa	That is not weird at all.My friend that recently got married had her mother walk her down cause she's never met her father either.I think its a lovely idea.Best wishes for your daughter.|`|PAZWfnFtaa	Happens more and more now.  It's absolutely fitting that the person who raised her "gives" her away.|`|lP04jzv6aa	not at all strange. Good luck.|`|RognTHFIaa	Hello..... Does she have a brother that could walk her down the isle? My Father died when I was an infant and I am getting married This coming up april and Im going to have my brother walk me down the isle but if she dont have any siblings I think It would be a great Idea to walk her down the isle and be there to watch your daughter start her life with her husband.... Greatest wishes to her.....|`|5c660267971d2a80a6200d8cbca57e1aaa	Sounds like you were Mother and Father both to your little girl so the honor should be yours.  It happens all the time!
CvkuzcpDaa	well...the whole thing seems pretty stupid!! lol...no offence!! calling someone using a pretend name??? anyhoo....if your friendship with leah/jenna means something to you and you miss it and you feel kinda bad, then apologise...then everything will probably go back to normal..BUT.....if you still feel like saying sorry isnt what you should have to do either.......talk to your friend and sort things out without apologising...like lets just forget this, it was a silly day,,its over, lets put it behind us...or......dont apologise...your friend will stay mad at you...and you will stay mad at your friend and then your friendship will probably be over...:(...do what u think is best huni! xx|`|AA11598063	That sounds unusual for your friend to ask you for an apology although you have done nothing wrong. Give her some time to cool off and she will realize that it is a silly situation and it shouldn't come in between your friendship. When she comes to you and talks to you, let her know to tell you in advance to not reveal her identity when you talk on the phone with your other friends. Let her come to you and talk to you because you have nothing to apologize for. Good luck.|`|aMqYdO0vaa	I can see where Jenna is mad at you. She told you to keep her Identity a secret and you told Kaela her real name. Maybe she didn't want her name out for a reason you never know. If you dont feel sorry dont even bother to apoligize,but try and put yourself in her shoes and try to see her side of it. Try talking it out througly. Remember,good friends work their problems out. Don't be close minded and listen.|`|7LNDxIr4aa	My best friend has mood swings. She isn't bipolar or anything, but she gets mad really easily. You just have to realize that's how some people are. It gets really frustrating, but if you love her as a friend you are going to have to get over it. If you apologize it will probably make everything okay, but something like this might happen again. I let my friend push me around like that, but I'm totally okay with that. When she gets mad about something stupid i just shut up for a few minutes and then she'll usually apologize or get over it. <br>  You have to decide if you'd rather let her make you apologize for something you didn't think was wrong so she isn't mad at you, or if you are going to do what you think you should, regardless of the fact that that could make her madder. It's your decision. <br>  I hope everything ends up okay.|`|F4ptJH67aa	To you it may seem like no big deal, but your friend may have had a different approach to it which may have caused her to be angry. Try to realize that there may have been other factors that triggered her emotions to lash out as anger. For example, she may have got into a fight with her parents, boyfriend; got into some trouble at school, received a bad grade. Try saying "sorry" and ask talk to her. Acknowledge her and let her know why you did what you did. It doesn't seem like your friend is mad for "no apparent reason".

U do not realize it now, but you will thank your mom in the future. It can get annoying, but she's only protecting you because you are young, she loves you, and you are her daughter. About the guy, who needs a boyfriend at this age? Seriously you will just get depressed if it doesn't work out, which it won't because you are 14<br>  and besides. you seem like you are doing very well the way your mom has been raising you.

You need to let her know that no matter how hard she tries to shelter you from danger, eventually you're GOING TO BE EXPOSED TO IT. <br>  <br>  Her keeping you away from the opposite sex and treating you like your seven is just going to leave you unprepared for the real world. Let her know that you're going to have to live your life and you're going to see and her innapropiate things. Explaint to her that she needs to let go.|`|gmJAKYTlaa	You might wanna talk to her about that, because even when you complain about it to her, she doesn't get it. Just sit down with her, tell her not to talk, and speak your mind. Or you can write it in a letter, that way, she's forced to not interrupt. Let her know you're responsible enough to see pg13 movies. She might as well learn or find a way to compromise, because no mom likes to know their child is unhappy.|`|rtR09kIfaa	You just have to get used to it and as time passes she will change. my mom used to be the same exact way and now i'm 16 and even though she's still overprotective she has learned to loosen up a little. Try getting a summer job or getting better grades so that she can learn to trust you better and see that you are actually mature. Hope it helps :)|`|aZLM3Nhqaa	Mothers to have the tendency to be a little overprotective; or in your case QUITE overprotective. However, she does have the right to worry about you and guys at your age. Remember, you are only 14. In my opinion, it is definitely alright to see PG-13 movies. I do not know how to handle that issue. Although, when it comes to guys, you have to let her lead you on what you can and can't do at your age. When you are 14, you shouldn't go on dates. That is rare at your age. You need to wait before going on the wild side. There are many things you don't know. Yes, you must learn from these mistakes that you will make in the future, but  in the FUTURE. Not right now. And it's not her that is making you hide things, it's you. I know that doesn't make much sense, but things only get worse when you bottle things up and keep many secrets from her. You could ruin your relationship with your mother. It's good that you are a good person, having and job and keeping your grades up, but that doesn't make any difference than if you didn't when it comes to your problem. Your mom loves you, and doesn't want you to be hurt because she knows how it is at your age. Your mother knows that being a teenager requires fun and a good time, but responsibility and boundaries. When you're 14, you are going to believe anything anyone tells you. You will be stubborn, make mistakes, and never listen to adults. But trust me. You need to listen. It is the only thing that will keep you on track to having a good year. Don't blame everything on your mother. She does it because she loves you. I know, corny right? But it's the truth. Talk to your mom. Let her know how you feel. It should help in the long run.

XUPsK2Nsaa	I've been in a 17 yr old struggle with my ex-friend. I'd say, please dont talk about me to the new friends, keep it seperate. If you can't then we can't be friends and there and so forth. She's just sewing her oats, trying new things out, and trying to be too cool in front of the new peeps. Just stay you and who you are and, tell her what exactly is bugging you.

Real friends would change like that. You should not hang around and wait for your friend if all they are going to do is change and try to change you. You are better than that.

You are probably just their back up friend.

w4ZPaxsbaa	I've read the two previous answers and I agree with both of them. Let me add to that it would be a very wise thing for you to rely more on your counselor in matters about your depression.<br>   Depression can be caused by either physiological factors, such as neuro-chemical imbalances +/or by emotional blockages, such as when one cannot completely cope or handle stressful situations then suppresses or denies them. Your counselor can help guide and assist you on which professional to seek to alleviate or handle your depression.<br>  <br>  Now as to your question about your teacher, as I said before, I agree with the 2 previous answers. It is, and seems to be developing into, a wonderful, influential, and lasting platonic Friendship with her. I'm many years older than you and I still remember 1 single teacher who had and was a great positive influence in my life when I was in h.s. You too have been blessed with such an adult.<br>  <br>  Yes, I also agree with your logical thinking that she may be the mother-figure at this time. Yours is a quite natural and healthy transference. Especially since you display such significant insight.<br>  Bears the mark of maturity on your part. That being said, go and develop the Friendship!|`|4lL6l0dFaa	There is nothing wrong with being close to a teacher in a friendly way. I could understand why you see her as a mother figure. You probably feel this way because you never had a mother figure in your life. I don't think that having this kind of relationship with a teacher is going to hurt you. Except that you will become really attached to her, and that might make it very painful when you have to leave her. You can tell her that she is like a mother figure to you only if you feel comfortable doing that. She might feel really glad that you think that way about her.|`|SzQi9N7daa	Well you should giver her the benefit of knowing how you feel about her, it's only fair.  She might be taken aback but then again she might be happy to hear you hold her in such high regard. Since you seem to be depressed about some things you might want to talk to a doctor about that as well. Being a kid in today's world is very hard, we all need a friend to help us through.<br>  <br>  One thing to remember, problems seem real big if we look at them all together, but if you take each one, one at a time, they just aren't as difficult as they might seem.<br>  <br>  I say tell her and see how it goes from there....<br>  <br>  Good Luck Hun....

V8Lyc2Jlaa	You lost me for a moment, but it's basically a "My friend likes me, but I don't like her" thing, right? Well, if you don't think it's going to work don't try anything, cause it would ruin the friendship as well. Do you have any friends who you think would be good for her? If so, talk to her about them (in a relaxed way), so that she gets the message that you want her to be happy, but you don't want to hook up with her. It might hurt her a bit in the beginning, but it would hurt a lot more if she was actually rejected face-to face.

7LNDxIr4aa	Everyone always says to join a sport or extracurricular activity, but I really would suggest that. If there is anything that starts before school starts, that you are good at or whatever, then join it. It will give you a lot more confidence to go to school that first day knowing a couple of people from your new sport. You'll probably get someone to sit with at lunch from that. <br>  If you don't want to start a new sport or whatever then just talk to people sitting next to you in your classes. Don't be pushy, just be yourself and laid back. <br>  I think the worst part will probably be the lunches. Once you've met some people who you can sit with, you'll be fine. Good luck! I hope everything works out.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Just be very friendly, smile a lot, and be polite. If you're the social type, you'll make friends easily.<br>  Good luck.

Be open and honest about her behavior so that she can do whatever she can to fix it and not cause anymore problems.<br>  <br>  If this approach doesn't work, tell the new girl that you no longer want to be friends with her because she was given the opportunity to change her behavior.

bO2rzfISaa	This is Marriage and Divorce.|`|wzqahEqiaa	I am 25 years old and I have never been married.  I will not intrude in a dating relationship.  If a guy wants to be with me he must be single.  Some people are afraid of being alone.  If a person shows they can be happy being single I think it's a sign of self assurance.  If a person tries to make me jealous it won't work.  People that try to make me jealous usually make me confused.<br>  <br>  If your friend is a private person he may not want to intrude.  Give him some time, listen to him, and be patient.  Don't play games and try being honest about your feelings.|`|stMcVPCMaa	I've always found that trying to induce jealousy doesn't work..most guys either ignore it or recognize it for what it is.<br>  <br>  It sounds like from what he focuses on in conversations that he just likes you as a friend.  But that can be hard to be sure of because a guy who likes you but who is insecure or afraid of losing a friendship by being too forward might keep quiet about how he feels.<br>  <br>  My test for whether a guy likes me is how he looks at me when we're together in person.  Does he look at you a lot?  Do you catch him looking at you when he doesn't think you're paying attention?  Or is it the opposite-he's easily distracted from looking at you even when you're in conversation?  My rule of thumb is the more he looks at you (especially when he thinks you're not paying attention), the more he likes you.. the less he looks, the less he likes you that way.  I base that off the general rule that guys have to be physically attracted to a woman before they can have romantic feelings for her.  (There's nothing wrong with this, I think it's just the way guys are.  And remember every guy's "type" is different and no woman will be attractive to every man.)
OHfZFR31aa	chances are your husband has calmed down now and won't press charges. If you busted his window, you'll just have to pay for the window repair and possibly some community service - it would be almost unheard of if you went to jail<br>  <br>  He may be gay but just didn't know it when he married you. I have gay friends who didn't come out until they were in their mid 20s or even 30s because they didn't accept that they were gay. He is probably really confused and also in pain himself, and even more upset that you told his parents as he hasn't been able to tell them yet<br>  <br>  Try to speak to him calmly on his own. Apologize for what you did but tell him that you were so upset and in shock. Ask him to tell you if he thinks he is gay or bi.  If he is you really can't get angry with him. That's who he is and how he was born. It's just a shame he had to find out after he had married a woman.<br>  <br>  It doesn't always have to be the end of your friendship. My friend Phil came out after being married for 5 years, and he and his ex-wife are still good friends. They realize they do love each other, but not in a sexual way.|`|z5hrgF45aa	oh honey, if the police *** confront and show the evidence what ticked u off. nothing will happen max they will ask u not to see ur husband. mind u who wants to see that gay again. prove ur point,  they will support u. seek help from ur close friends and family too
y4SUDnpaaa	My husband and I have gone several times and I consider ours a happy marriage. In all marriages problems occasionally arise, when we had a problem we just couldn't settle ourselves we went to marriage counseling and every single time we found a solution or a compromise. Not everyone will have the positive results we had, it depends on how honest you are and what you put into it. At the very least it shows you did everything you could to save a marriage.|`|BUET39wmaa	well it all depends on how committed you both are to fixing things.<br>  if she is wishy washy and doesn't put her heart into it then money spent on a therapist may be wasted.<br>  you need to first have a heart to heart with her and see where she stands.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|B12E4rYiaa	Marriage counseling saves a lot of marriages. If you don't like them you can get another one. However, you need to give them time at least 6 weeks would be a good time frame to try them out then if they are good stick it out until everything is resolved.|`|stMcVPCMaa	I've been to several marriage counselors for my past marriage.  They didn't help in the end, but I'd say it's worth a try anyway.. if things still don't work out, at least you'll know you did everything you can!<br>  If you visit a counselor and you don't feel that he/she is helping, try another one until you find one that works.  I suggest since your wife is the one who is struggling with her feelings, your best bet is to find a woman, rather than a man, who can more easily see things from your wife's viewpoint.|`|afkygHMgaa	Every situation is different. Is it worth it? OF COURSE it is worth it, since anything that may help is worth a try. I have been to a marriage counselor. It did not help me since the guy I went with had his own personal issues that were not condusive to a healthy relationship. However, your case may be different. Give it a try and the best of luck to you. I hope you get back together|`|TQ47vny4aa	I can speak from the heart on this matter. My wife filed papers on me in Feb. of 07. It was on a Friday, had to be the worst day of my life. We talked it thru and sought out marriage counseling. We did counseling for over year and a half. It did wonders for us. We have been married for over 17 years and you build up a lot of tension and frustration over the years and some of us just need a way to let it all out in the open. Marriage counseling was the best thing that ever happened to us, our marriage could not be any better now.|`|2MZXQzRjaa	I think if you love her enough you will try anything to make it turn around.<br>  <br>  You should watch the movie 'fireproof' or go to www.fireproofmymarriage.com
AA12260791	I have the same problem. I my former best friend was my best friend since 6th grade but we got into a fight and she went back to her other friend who treated her like crap. I was tired of trying to be her friend so I left her alone. We are not friends now but I feel so much better knowing I dont have to be someone else just to hang out with her. I left her alone and im happier so i recomend that to you but if you think you can fix the friendship then go for it, i have faith in you.<br>  <br>  GOODLUCK, i know you will do you right thing.<br>  <br>  And its not like she is your only friend...you deserve better|`|7LNDxIr4aa	Just give her space. Teenagers go through strange times. Find some other friends to hang out with in the meantime who are more fun to be around.

3Dhacs6caa	Definatley try out for a sport! U'll meet tons of friends and u'll be busy. i think thats the best idea. also, u could try getting peoples' numbers, aim, msn, myspace, etc. start getting to know them by IM, messaging, texting, etc. also, i think the best qualities a friend could have is to be fun, funny, have good advice, caring and nice. so whenever u see people smile, say hi. always be happy, have confidence in urself, etc. show people that ur funny and also thoughtful. they could always come to u for advice. and show them ur a fun & outgoing person to hang out with.|`|CvkuzcpDaa	ok...well the soccer and wrestling is a good place to find friends..!<br>  also....just be a nice person! e friendly to ppls...when people talk to you...talk back and keep the conversation going...just remember that 3 good friends is better than a bunch of not so good friends..good luck! xx:)|`|xJS3BdUNaa	First, be yourself because nobody wants to be friends with somebody who is fake.  Plus if they didn't know who you really are they really wouldn't be your friends anyway.<br>  <br>  Second, don't seem desperate for friends.  From this question you sound desperate and that's weird.<br>  <br>  Finally, don't be too serious, smile, laugh, and be fun.  Get good at telling stories becasue being funny and interesting attracts people to you.<br>  <br>  That's all I got.  Good Luck
PAA4uWPuaa	Well first of all the wife must have  known he had child support obligations before they got married so she should not be whining about it now if she married him. <br>  <br>  And yes this can put a strain on marriage. <br>  At one point my hubby was working some crappy jobs and when he got tired of them he could just quit because he knew I would still be able to keep us afloat, <br>  Honestly it wasn't the money thing that bothered me but that idea that I was the one who had to have the better job. <br>  I had a job at a place one time and I hated it. I wanted that oppurtunity to quit just like he was but I couldn't.|`|4POGapREaa	People make poor choices sometimes, both men & women.  My old boss supported her cheating, lazy, rude husband but she did that in her prior 2 marriages as well.  She has some sort of need to use possessions & money to keep men around.  I don't know.  It's sort of like she feels if she doesn't give enough, they won't love her anymore & she doesn't want to be alone.  It's obviously something psychological.  Men support women too & let them take advantage.|`|YzObEmUqaa	Yes dear.<br>  Money does make a big difference in a relationship.|`|ec48c16dc112b295020793ee70d144e3aa	Yes, especially for chicks.|`|th7C1aoaaa	OK .First off why marry a guy you know was a cheater? The economy is tough. So the job thing may be legit. However what's he providing?
nqINitkmaa	Cute! I would figure out a way to shorten the story of how you and Peter met, and try to talk more about the two of them, maybe tell what their first conversation was, and try to through some simple humor into it.|`|4POGapREaa	I like it.  Maybe you could include a little more about Sarah or their relationship though.|`|AA10378447	Maybe wrap up the story about how you and Peter met a little sooner, and focus more on what you know of their relationship and how they're great for each other. Focus on your friendship with the both of them. Just talking about Peter makes it sound like you and Peter are getting married.<br>  <br>  Overall, very heartfelt and sincere. I would just mention more about the relationship the newly married couple have so that people aren't thrown off.|`|9pDEhA1Xaa	I would agree with the above.  Don't talk more than one minute.  People won't listen much after that!

To make sure you have success, you need to look for tips on making new friends. The following are some of the most relevant guides that you can apply, when you are looking to meet new people. First, you need to be open to the thought of having friends. In other words, you need to ensure that you really need friends. Many of us do not know the reason why we are constantly looking for friends. Some people are not interested in the companionship that friends bring but are looking to be popular and outdo others. It really matters what your intentions of having friends are. The best thing is to really have friends for the purpose of love and companionship. New people are always fearful of stepping on toes or brushing people in the wrong way. We are all nervous about new things and new people. Therefore, when you do not feel like you are up to meeting people, you need to come down and look at the importance of having friends. Many times, the people we are trying to befriend might even pass the message that they do not want to be friends.<br>  <br>  To make new friends, you need to be positive. One bad experience should not make you want to have a breakdown. When it comes to new people, you can expect anything and, success might not come immediately. Look for new friends among the people you are meeting often. If you are in a school set up, you can talk to people you are in same classes or sports with. It is through common interests that people come together for friendship. If you are working, your colleagues can make good friends. You want to have friends who are close to you and not ones that you cannot reach. When you work together with people, you spend an awfully long time with them and, strong relationships do emanate from such places. If you are at home wondering where you can meet new people, why not peep outside. Better yet, if you are not house bound, take a walk and try to make eye contact with people. Life will only give you what you search for and, if you look for friends, you will find them. Build some confidence and you will realize that saying halo to somebody will not cost a thing.<br>  <br>  Other tips on making friends include being the ideal friend. For example, make an effort to show that you are a friend in the making. Reach out to people when they need help. For example, if you have an extra pen, extending your help will not hurt at all. Take advantage of little situations to really get to know people. New people may be intimidating but, when you look at things from a positive light, you will be surprised at how easy making a connection is. When you spot people who are very friendly to you, do not have to be cold to them. Show that you are a person open to making new friends. Remember, we cannot live alone in life; we need others to help us share the wonders and beauty of life.|`|bJu8TvGMaa	you could go out more<br>  if your old enough go to pubs and clubs and meet people there<br>  <br>  or you could try joining groups, like sports you enjoy and meet people that way.<br>  <br>  if there are people you see around alot just smile and say hi to them and soon you will become friends

Sorry, but if you are gonna go silk, then the better looking silk flowers often are just as expensive as real. I know I will get lots of thumbs down, but I think MOST fake flowers are tacky.|`|jZNavGmtaa	I think it will look very pretty with black dresses. The colors in the bouquet are very soft which will highlight the black. Nice choice of bouquet. Hope you have a great wedding.|`|3d1XRIzkaa	Yes, those colors in the bouquet would look very nice with the black dresses. The white and pink go very well with black. An excellent choice in colors for the bouquet.|`|AaoclPYCaa	Anything really goes with black.  My son and daughter in law had a black and burgundy wedding.

Good Luck and happy planning.|`|rZXQvA75aa	I agree with Brwneyes and Good Gyrl. Fake flowers just do not look as nice as real flowers.

51acbe8d76e943be6450d2e1ba80f1cfaa	Don't ask her to do the dishes. Tell her to do the dishes. She's part of the family and everyone in a family should have responsibilities in the home. There's nothing wrong with an allowance, but if she doesn't keep up with her chores, don't pay her. I would only pay an allowance for chores like, dishes, or doing a little laundry, or dusting the furniture, <br>  or vacuuming. I don't think kids should get money for keeping their bedrooms clean. That's just something they should be doing no matter what.|`|vnJG8UYJaa	You have two choices, positive reinforcement or negative consequences.  <br>  <br>  If you were a teen, which situation would you prefer?  You are trying to get a young lady ready to be independent.  You can use the allowance as a way of teaching her to handle money.<br>  <br>  Sit down and figure out a reasonable amount that you are giving her for weekly expenditures.  For instance, lunch money, snacks, cold drinks, movie rentals, etc.  Then double it.  You can require her to buy her own lunches out of the allowance.  You might want to request that she put so much into a savings account each week.  Then, the rest is hers to spend as she pleases.  You would need to come to some sort of an agreement as to still voicing your opinions or being able to say no to certain activities, clothing choices, hair choices, etc.  You also need to be very specific on what chores she is doing for the allowance and what chores you expect her to do as part of the household.  If she doesn't do the household chores, you can deduct from her allowance.  Combine the two systems and make it work for your family.  Be clear,  and concise.  Also, make arrangements to sit down and talk once a month to see how things are working out for everyone involved.  She may absolutely hate doing dishes, but she might like mowing the yard.  Use this to your advantage and don't make contributing to the workload a punishment to her.  <br>  <br>  After you have some ideas of what you would like to work out, sit down and get her ideas too.  She should have a say so in what the decisions are.  You will be showing her that you are willing to listen and that you respect what she has to say.  This will open up other opportunities for communication with your daughter.  <br>  <br>  You treat her like an adult by giving her respect.  You give respect, you will get respect.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11447210	She lives in the home, she uses the resources, she should help repay that in some way.<br>  <br>  She won't help? Then take away ALL her privileges until she does. If she's not going to contribute to the household then she gets NOTHING extra, no going out with friends, no TV, no cell phone, no computer except as required for school use, etc.<br>  <br>  She either does her part, or chooses to live with only the bare bones she must have by law, to get by....until she's willing to be a contributing member of the household.<br>  <br>  Life isn't free...she needs to learn that now.|`|46ZGLs43aa	Why not try a chore chart?  Each item you want her to do has a monetary value. I'm not sure what kids are getting for allowance these days, but set a price for each item.  For example, putting away the dishes is $2.  Each day she does it get checked off on the chart and at the end of the week or however you set it up, that's what she gets paid.|`|s940xWIraa	YES! But you should slowley lower the allowance until she doesn't get one anymore, but she still will do her chores!|`|z98UFPmIaa	allowance helps. im 14 and getting paid for cleaning around the house is a perfect way of earning money.|`|jxdMIAoBaa	whup her ***|`|CAhunDFnaa	From my point of view.(im 13) I don't belive you should give her an allowence. This will just make her more dependable on you for money. She will be on her own soon and needs to learn how to make money herself.  When she dosent do her chores punish her by taking away her favorite things: cellphone, iPod, TV. Only reward her by allowence when she does things that you havent told her like taking out the trash when it wasn't her turn or offering to help you around the house.

I guess it depends on what kind of person he is but I would bring him something to remember you by. As if you are there with him all the time. If he was younger I would suggest a teddy bear but maybe a little trinket that you have. One of your ear rings if you are a girl and if you are a boy then something that means you. Something you always wear. For me it would be a wrist band for example.|`|VPvtITeeaa	Maybe a stuffed animal, a card. Maybe something you know he would like. His favorite music? Magazine?

Email, phone, text, myspace...anything? Even snailmail. Just to know he's still there will help.<br>  <br>  Good luck for the both of you. I wish you all the best.|`|pxEoQ1IWaa	Ignore crisa! They're just rude. The Internet makes it soo easy to keep up with friends. Get a Facebook/Myspace and ask him to make one too, IM him, email him, call him, text him. It won't be the same as seeing him, but you don't have to lose contact. Is he asking you to lose contact? If so, maybe explain how much it hurts you. Before he goes, see if you can get together with him for a little time together.|`|9pDEhA1Xaa	You can still be friends by phone or Email.

If this guy is asking you not to call, then just don't call. It hurts, but you'll get over it in time, the last thing you want is to have the police involved. Good luck to you.|`|QilfSBfsaa	If he thinks you might hurt him he may get a retain order from police.|`|K5uoaetaaa	If you are harassing them - i.e. continuously texting and contacting them after you have been asked not to - then they can get a restraining order, yes.|`|kFHwzBG7aa	Yeah he probably can, it doesn't take much.  Especially if you're the crazy type.  If they don't want to give you closure, then just let it go.  There's your closure.|`|wi6mkT30aa	Well hes just threatened to do it so it's pretty obvious hes not interested in talking. I know you wanted closure and that's so important to you I"m sure, but he's just not into hearing it or anything. I think you should respect his wishes and not bother him anymore. <br>  <br>  I think he can get a re staining order against you because of peace disturbance and other numerous things.<br>  <br>  Be careful, just stay away.|`|VPvtITeeaa	Well stop obsessing over him then. Obviously, he doesn't want to see you, if he threatens that. And obviously you aren't leaving him alone, like he wants to be. & Yes they can. Just because your not threatening to harm him, doesn't mean you aren't harrassing him.|`|XZiEBkUuaa	I guess that would depend on the judge, but if he is threatening a restraining order, I'd just take the hint and back off.|`|lmX5wGM3aa	no , as long as you don't emotionally or psychilly hurt him, maybe this guy is just scared or not a people person?

200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	She associates a pole to a stripper.<br>  <br>  A lot of people are very quick to judge pole dancing as a sexual situation rather than a fitness ability.<br>  <br>  I pole dance (fitness) and there is a big difference between pole dancing in the club v.s the pole fitness.  You can intermix but there is more a "classy" side than the "raw and dirty".<br>  <br>  If I was 16, my mom would be the same.<br>  <br>  But that I am an adult, my mom thinks it is cool and she even would love to take classes. <br>  <br>  I have my guest room which converts into my "play room".  Lights, husband built a hard wood floor to put down, boa feathers, mirrors etc. He is my husband, he is spoiled lol. But, it is more of a "indoor"  thing for personal use as far as that goes.  <br>  <br>  But the fitness part is all about me staying fit and having fun dancing.<br>  <br>  so, you are kinda in a situation where if you are living with your mom, the rules remain hers if that is her house.<br>  <br>  P.S. Strippers dance on more than just poles...at a local strip club, they have a "wheel" connected to the ceiling that they spin around on. The same type of wheel you would see on a children's play ground! A little creepy but, just to show you, anything can be a "stripper's" toy in all reality.<br>  <br>  It is how you use the tool. Not how it is labeled!|`|7PbJWEo1aa	Thats sweet that ya mum is looking out for you!<br>  <br>  Why don't you take her to the class, have a giggle and maybe she will come round to the idea.

Around here most everyone has buffet receptions, for starters. I've only been to one wedding that had table service. <br>  <br>  I've never seen a candy buffet but I do like the idea. I've never seen food "stations" or desert buffets either.
UWx1beYtaa	You need to sit her down and talk to her.<br>  <br>  Tell her firmly that you do not like the way she touches you and walks into you room when you are changing.<br>  <br>  You need your privacy and she needs to back off.

Xc3ukGowaa	You sound so young but I will try to give you an answer from a old married lady. All of us girls have read books and seen movies about that "magic" . The way movies portray "it" doesn't exist. As your relationship develops you will feel the "magic" just being with him, when he holds your hand or smiles at you. Do not expect bells and whistles just a warm comfortable feeling that can come from being with him or kissing him. Sometimes you might feel that "magic" but be cautious --you cannot build a relationship on just that--it will not last. You need substance in a relationship--common interests, respect and enjoyment in each others company.|`|XEJD4mLWaa	To be honest, the whole sparks when kissing is just a way to entertain people and I don't think that is actually the case. It's just been forced into our systems by films and stuff that we think it has to happen like that or it doesn't work at all. All that matters is you love him and he loves you.<br>  Just ask yourself do you like him (don't lie to yourself). If you like him then there's no reason you should break up with him.<br>  <br>  You say that you love him and you can see you spending your life with him, that's something very big to say. And the only negative is that you don't feel what others feel. What if others don't actually feel this spark and they just make it up to make their relationship sound special. What you have said seems like there's nothing wrong in your relationship.<br>  <br>  Just remember, love is not just about kissing!<br>  <br>  Also perhaps you don't have as many nerve endings in your lips than you would like so you don't feel "something", I don't know, just a theory.<br>  <br>  Hope it works out =D|`|eZWElLUcaa	maybe you are still feeling some resistance because he had hurt you a lot when he ended it with you in the past and you dont want to be too close to him again in case he hurts you again<br>  <br>  also maybe u dont feel as close to him coz he might have kissed other people when he wasnt with you<br>  <br>  the kissing should start to feel more natural. take it one step at a time and dont rush it. ask him how he feels about it when you kiss<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|ynYtewrYaa	AT FIRST I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY I STILL DONT BUT FROM MY EXPERIENCE OF RELATIONSHIPS I NEVER REALLY HAD ANY SPARKS FROM KISSING I NEVER EVEN REALLY PAID IT NO MIND I KNOW I HAD THE LOVE OF MY LIFE THINGS WENT BAD I STILL LOVE HIM BUT POINT IS MY LOVE FOR HIM WASNT BECAUSE OF A KISS MY SPARKS AND LOVE CAME FROM JUST BEING AROUND HIM.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	as your kisses grow so will your love ..
lTNcvqyHaa	Sadly at this stage in life it does.<br>  <br>  Kids think they are 'COOL' and wear the uniform the marketers advertise is "this is Cool and where it is at". They think that they are different and breaking out - but they are trying to express themselves.<br>  <br>  It is sweet that they want you to join them in what they think is "the Look", but they don't understand that they are labeling themselves, with trade names and fashion trends.<br>  <br>  If you want - you can go to the local op shop and buy black grunge clothing for half the price. Or you can buy some clothing dyes and re-dye your own clothing black - but, don't go and buy stuff you don't like or can't afford And jewelery on guys is very yuck.<br>  <br>  Good luck - stay friends - styles come and go but good friends last forever.|`|F3KkB4GWaa	Doesn't affect me and my friends. I feel like I stand out a little sometimes (but between you and me I kind of like the feeling). The only time it bugs me is when we go shopping and all want to go to different stores. And they shouldn't be jerks to you just because somethings different from what you like doesnt make it bad.|`|b4s7j9xGaa	Just tell him that this is wat i want to wear and thats wat yyou wear. If there emo and ur just some normal person than dont hang out with them anymore|`|OEqxVXYVaa	i guess not because they are only your friends if they accept the way you are<br>  or else their not ur true friends|`|QeJYadsHaa	Yes, I believe it can.<br>  <br>  I mean, look around at the groups of friends. Most of them look the same because they wear the same clothes. <br>  <br>  Me and my friends look different from each other. 1 is boho, 1 is into lots of jewlery, and i am casual.<br>  <br>  People judge others too much, I mean I do.<br>  <br>  But I don't think it should matter what you wear. Unless it's hollister.<br>  :) jk|`|hz6Lo0wraa	It sounds like you are understanding how shallow your "friends" are. I would honestly say that if them making fun of you bothers you past a tolerable point, tell them to cut it out. If they do not respect your wishes, chances are they are not true friends. <br>  <br>  To answer your question clothing can affect weak relationships, but will never affect a strong one.|`|Nigyj6Sjaa	yea cause that mean you dont have that common ..<br>  and guess if you guys really close you would like same shirt or something|`|9OVXZMPZaa	umm no|`|HJrTuihcaa	It's just like 'skateboarding style' every group has their own style. Which i think is stupid but it's alright if you don't dress like that, as long as they like you for you.|`|F57ep5jHaa	it can, but it think your the only one down to earth in compared to all your friends, like splurge once in a while, but not for every outfit. it's just clothing.
AA11923213	Maybe hes embarrassed of you.<br>  <br>  or hes a punk.|`|obQEUdEeaa	I would be feel disgusted. What the heck is this guy doing. Why would he do that is beyond me for sure. I think maybe you should consider moving on because he  may have something to hide such as he has a "real" girlfriend and your not it or he is married or I could go on and on. You should never date someone for that long at your age and not meet the parents if they are in town unless he has something to hide. I would suggest you confront him and seriously think about moving on and forget him.|`|RR4oRK4Paa	He might be embarrassed of you or feel that his parents would not accept you/ approve. #1 RULE if he denies you let it go IMMEDIATELY no matter how hard it is!It is best to just break up and move on because excuses will surface and time will be wasted. You are too old to waste your time.. find a guy who APPRECIATES YOU!|`|f20d38f2d9e2702cb548cbcb14a06eb8aa	There is only one explanation here... he does not want his parents to know that he is dating you.  Why? - well you will have to ask him.<br>  <br>  I suspect he thinks or knows they will disapprove.<br>  <br>  I think it is time for a heart to heart talk; I don't believe this relationship is headed in the direction you think it is...|`|ynYtewrYaa	WELL FIRST OF ALL IM YOUNGER THAN U IM 21 I MAY NOT KNOW MUCH YET. MY BOYFRIEND AND I HAVE BEEN DATING FOR 2 YEARS NOW THIS MONTH AND I HAVE NEVER OFFICIALLY MET HIS PARENTS NOW WHEN I SAY THAT I MEAN I'VE SEEN THEM BUT NEVER BEEN INTRODUCED NOW WHAT ITS SOUND LIKE IN UR SITUATION IS THAT HE MAY EITHER BE ASHAMED OF YOU OR HE COULD BE DATING SOMEONE ELSE MY FATHER TELLS ME THAT IF A MAN LIKES U OR LOVES YOU HE WOULD WANT U TO MEET HIS PARENTS U SHOULDN'T HAVE TO ASK|`|OEqxVXYVaa	probably because he is nervouse or imberresed to tell his parents u r going out whith him they might not allow it  he dosnt whant to get in troble|`|Wa9Zr4HHaa	Momma's boy. Ask him why he did it, and then embarass him in your own way to get him back.|`|guydISrcaa	you might be embarrassing to him. he might have a secret. i don't know u so i don't know y he did this good luck|`|ZjLlRU8paa	i think he is a dick. if he difdnt even tell his parents, whom hes close with about you hes not taking your relationship seriously, you should sit down and talk to him about it.|`|fKIl4RDcaa	he probabley shy maybe you should ask him to get them to met you i mean if he actually loves you he will do it if he dont it just proves hes an **** good luck to you|`|jZguzD2Raa	He's probably shy and didn't want to tell his parents right then and there. He will hopefully sit them down and tell them soon.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|QM7cAE4vaa	I'm sorry to hear that.  he probably is afraid to tell them for some reason.  Maybe they are mean to girlfriends, maybe they only want him dating a certain type of girl that you are not, for example: a certain religion, a particular hair color.... etc..  Maybe he was trying to spare your feelings.  You need to find out though, because if he is ashamed of you, it is time to move on.  If it was something else, that also needs to be discussed because he can't hide you forever.|`|NtFC5sn4aa	o im soo sorry to hear this... well idk y he would say that i think maybe it's cause something todo with his parents...(maybe they have some kind of problam)... i dont know who he is and how he acts so i dont know y he did dat?... if i were u i would confront him and ask him y and talk to him... (possiably brake up wit him- if he does not give u a good answer) <br>  <br>  good luck...|`|xUYpKgoJaa	His parents might of had bad experiences with other siblings and girlfriends or his parents will embarrass him badly!|`|Qkg98XtHaa	Maybe he's shy about telling them,and doesn't know what they would think if he told them. But, you have the right to be mad at him-its been eight months for crying out loud!!!!!!|`|ov9bpT3Taa	Hello,  I honestly always lookup different sites online to see if I can find any forums or blogs with info as well.

aZLM3Nhqaa	Rude friends are the worst. Your friend is definitely something. The best thing to do is to confront. Sit down with her and calmly and rationally talk things out. If that doesn't work, drop her. She will understand then what a bad friend she was. All it takes is forgiveness. And once she apologizes and understands how important your friendship is, then paying for everything and arguing isn't what needs to happen. It should be you and her together.|`|lWolp5Csaa	If she does these things to you, she may not be your real friend. even if you say no and feel that she`s a freakin mooch. Tell her that she has starts to looking after herself or she can pay for everything herself and drive herself around. but say it with strongness and confidence. be calm about it. if she makes a rude comment back walk away and ignore it. if she keeps on bugging you and you don`t like it. it`s called harassment and you should tell someone about it.|`|STNnndJwaa	That means she's not your friend. Just talk to her about it and then if she keeps telling you to pay for her and being rude, then stop hanging out with her<br>  <br>  <br>  help?!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222124256AAsn1hr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|WKWejOllaa	Talk to her patiently and stand your ground.

I had to look for new doctors and everything... I have bcbsfl insurance and I look on their website for doctors and when I can't find this what I look for I look online in yellow pages! some of then have ratings but I already learned that to find a good doctor you need to have luck and you need to try! (for example my bf love her dentist so I went there and I just hated her! - almost sue them!) so the doctor what one people like you may not to like as much! <br>  Good luck and lots of patience:D|`|ZyK5fW2yaa	Go to your family doctor because most of the time you need a refferal.  You do for a dermatologist for sure.|`|6LKEWFPoaa	Unless you are going to marry that dermatologist or gynecologist, I fail to see how this has any thing to do with marriage and divorce.|`|AA11286626	I suggest that you look to see if you have a University Hospital in your area, they almost have all the medical fields covered well.<br>  Good Luck

But you need to let her know that this time if she doesn't come home. Someone else will be keeping you warm at night.

qcy86nbcaa	i really like 2 because its both sophisticated and elegant !  its different than the standard wedding dress and the fabric rather than the beading takes the center of attention ! i love it ! congratulations|`|dpk9n2SSaa	I also like #2 the best. Which dress do you think your body looks better in? What does your mom or your best friend say? They are both very pretty dresses, but one may look better on you than the other. Best wishes on your choice!|`|2Av3gIqgaa	I like the second one.  The venue you have picked out looks really beautiful and classy and I think the second dress is more streamlined and matches the venue.<br>  <br>  Plus, I think the dresses with the pickups look silly.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uJXQ3EHoaa	I like the way the bust is emphasized more on the first one, the second one it just kind of all blends together.|`|iGTIFmTLaa	I like number 1, the neckline is really pretty. Number 2 is a little plain. and CONGRATULATIONS!!|`|uMj5csRdaa	100% number 1. i love the top part and the ruffle-y things all the way down the bottom are absolutley gorgeous!|`|73fuqfSyaa	This is a tough question, but sweetie, I would go with No. 2.

I love the neckline and I've never been a fan of the drapery look on dresses. lol But that's a personal choice.<br>  <br>  You need to try them on, maybe neither will suit you and you'll  fall in love with something else. You never know.<br>  but my vote is #2<br>  <br>  edit: alright since you've tried them both on DEFINITELY #2.  It's elegant and timeless looking yet trendsetting. just gorgeous!  By the way, your location: GORGEOUS!|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	2. I don't like pick-ups.

obQEUdEeaa	It sounds like to me that both of you struggle with showing your emotions and feelings for one another. Have you both been hurt in previous relationships because generally that is why people feel afraid to express their feelings.... out of fear of another rejection. It sounds to me that he loves you and you love him. I think you both could be helped by sitting down and talking about how you feel and why you struggle with showing it. Maybe even do this with a relationship counselor or a church couselor. If you have issues from previous relationships then please do your best to let go and not let those issues stand in the way of what could be a great future with this man.|`|wOl4yGSlaa	i have this type of relationship in reverse. he says all the sweet things to me and, i know i don't return it or show i care enough.  I'm afraid to get hurt which is why i beat around the bush when i respond.  Lately i have been trying to be more straight forward and say exactly how i feel, because I'd rather show him i care than loose him for not.  <br>  So give him time, ask him what he wants and try and help him understand himself better.

dpk9n2SSaa	I advise finger food receptions are always the easiest, especially if you serve cold foods such as mini sandwiches, fancy hors d'oeuvres, veggies with dip, shrimp cocktail,...<br>  <br>  If you want to serve hot food, consider grilled shrimp kabobs, chicken kabobs, beef kabobs. We made some for a party last summer and they were a big hit and were gone before anything else. Best wishes on your marriage!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Serve your favorite foods, whatever those may be. Call up your favorite restaurant to do catering and you won't pay near as much as you will for a regular wedding caterer. Most guests prefer comfort foods that they are familiar with and don't like fancy, exotic foods that they won't eat any other day of the year just because it's a wedding. And if people don't eat it, then it's money that you have wasted.|`|31569887b5b5a617c4b12e437c8f2fd6aa	I heard about this one woman from Chicago who had sort of a Taste of Chicago theme for her wedding reception.

XGgPhaDbaa	Discuss this with your parents.<br>  <br>  I do have to say that he is trying to find a girl with a bad eating disorder to help her but is going about it the wrong way.<br>  Maybe he should send a letter to all parents so they could watch their child for eating disorders in stead of him stalking around the halls.|`|0951bd7ae0d4ac1c92edf05dc2422d6faa	yes i definitely think you should tell your parents.If anything he should have went to them first.i think he may be concerned because this could be a serious disorder but from what it sounds he is a little too concerned maybe u have a classmate that doesn't like you and she is telling him lies and naming you.i would definitely bring my parents in.|`|9PbyjAEXaa	tell ur parents because that is creepy. and if u dont feel like u have lost weight and neither does anyone else then he might just need a reason to watch u closely|`|GyFwkIbEaa	ya i would discuss it with your parents and just be like it is really buggin me.... can you go tell him its not me because he wont freakin believe me....<br>  <br>  wow i would hate the principal!|`|bP5zyipXaa	yes you should he has no right to harase you like that
o67LnDLOaa	I believe he has some type of interest in the attractive married woman and maybe she is someone who he sees himself compatible with.

In any case, marriage to many does not automatically or necessarily preclude a friendship with a member of the opposite sex.|`|fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	Maybe he needs an illusion of a relationship. It feels so "safe" to him - she is married and far away. But not so good for her. What's in it for her?|`|AA11706291	He has found a friend he enjoys speaking to, the fact she is a married woman means nothing.|`|AA11286626	He wants to bang her.

dcEpLrTOaa	Well im in the same situation right now but if he cares about you then you should give him a chance and see what happens. :)|`|Un511PNWaa	give this guy a chance|`|F57ep5jHaa	i'm so sorry. just say that your not sure, and will consider it, hopefully it'll pas.|`|dRyifylCaa	Ok yea at first i was gonna be like ''wtf!!!! go out with him'' but then again if hes like your bestfriend i think you guys would be better off friend because most of the time when 2 bestfriend brake up they dont stay friends and you loose them.|`|IE1LvgD9aa	What if you don't give him a chance. Then the one you are waiting for never comes around?Would you rather be alone than give this guy a chance?|`|08RugVdtaa	NO!You may find that you like this guy more...The world doesn't stop for one person.Give em' a chance!;) Good luck!|`|Qh20dRs8aa	well you shouldn't go out with him for awhile and then dump him when your other friend becomes available, that would hurt more than just rejecting him now
kX2OWqP7aa	In paragraph two, you say, ".....accomplish the grades I know I am able to get."  Change that to "....the grades I am capable of."   <br>  Overall, it sounds ok.  Not great.  It sounds a little repetitive.  You make it very clear that you want to do your best in school no matter what.  But that's about all I got out of it.  <br>  I'd rap it up with something about how I think this program will help me in the future with going to college and getting a job, instead of that last paragraph about your drive and values.|`|guydISrcaa	too much stuff i only could read the first sentence
FDv2ri5saa	well my parents are kinda the same- but not that bad... sit down and have a talk with them, because if u don't tell them how you feel they will never really know. if you have already done that- then tell them that this stuff happens to irrisponsible kids- and they wont be able to protect you when u are an adult.  make sure they know how u feel- and dont try to rebel.  all i can say is i wish you the best of luck- and if worse comes to worse- ask one of ur best friends parents or a teacher to help you= and talk to your parents for you.|`|fHwGbsRMaa	Whatever you do, don't keep it in. I did then I exploded on them, ran away and everything. I started Rebeling and Im only 15. I suggest you go 'look what excatly is ur problem do I look like the type of person to do this?' or something like that.|`|3fVmIfFvaa	parents can be piss offs i saying out loud i feel the same as u they always like oh this will happend to you are that will happend to u tell em i'm 15 back off|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Anna, how old are you?

wgOzHizAaa	You should really be more specific, the term sex offender is this very vague title that is cast over many people. You can also be put on the sex offender registry for urinating in public, mooning, streaking and skinny dipping. Consensual sex between an 18 and a 17 year old will also get you on the list. <br>  <br>  The laws very by state. <br>  They can buy homes. If the sex offense is against a child their house usually has to be at least 500ft away from daycare, schools and playgrounds. <br>  Again if the offense involved a child there are rules on where they can stay, most cases it's the parents decision if they want that person at there house. <br>  Yes I would date a registered sex offender, depending on the charge.|`|hVrfm4eIaa	The laws regarding sex offenders are slightly different depending on the state.  Yes, sex offenders can buy a home but usually not within so many feet of a school or public park.  I would never date a sex offender.  I want children one day, and I would never put children in such a dangerous position.  There is nothing attractive about a sexual predator.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Why would anyone date or get married to a registered sex offender or let them stay in a house with children? That's like putting a bottle of vodka in front of an alcoholic|`|mMBzpldbaa	i think that unfortunately, sex offenders are allowed to buy property, but it's good that the residents around them must be informed if the sex offender is a pedophile. they won't be able to sleep over at a friend's home that has children. i would die rather than date a registered sex offender. they are all scum and should be executed. i wouldn't marry one, so your last question does not apply to me.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i agree wholeheartedly with the first answerer.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	As a child abuse advocate..I would not date a sex offender..they have the right to live in the community..I have three of them near me..like two blocks from my house. I don't like it..but that is the reality.<br>  I stay clear of anyone with sexual assault issues..rather I turned in a predator..he had molested numerous children, both in NJ/Philippines.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	I wouldn't go near a sex offender, especially one who has molested children!  Whoever lets one around their kids is stupid!|`|2nsNvIanaa	just turn yr back n go away|`|izdbKthpaa	Dam honestly; heres the truth, yes they can buy a home, just because they're sex offenders does'nt mean they cant buy a home (I wish they coulnt) but yh, and know they're NOT supposed to be in contact with any child, and fuk no I a guy but fuk that, ha and the last question!! DIVORCE his ***!! He's a reg. sex offender he was found guilty in the court of law for a sex offense thats not he good he might be a thrat to you, and also your lil baby :)
c7G7CzZYaa	Heyy, I know how to solve it. The next time your over her house you go to the bathroom and put a clear disgusting drink in the toilet and when she drinks out of the toilet, she wont like it and she wont do it anymore!|`|STNnndJwaa	That is SOOOO unsanitary!!I would totally stop being friends with her cuz THAT IS JUST GROSS AND WEIRD!!<br>  ugh!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  help?!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222124256AAsn1hr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|bZhnLjHGaa	Okay, well if her name was , lets just say, Amanda.  You should say Amanda, whya re you drinking out of the toilet.<br>  Is it an obsession?<br>  Why do you do it?<br>  and more wierd questrions.<br>  <br>  But I would say:   Let Me Try!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|dUVQZh8Baa	OK shut up everyone yeah it's gross but you shouldn't stop being her friend just because she drinks out the toilet. Everyone has bad habits and you don't stop being their friends if they pick their nose or whatever, that is so wrong. Talk to her. Ask her the reasons for her habits. Make a joke out of it like Most People get their water from a bottle or the sink or something, I am not sure. Tell her how unhygienic it is and that there are risks of doing it and you are worried. There might be a reason, you never know. Whatever you do don't lose a friend over a bad habit. She should be able to take your advice, a true friend would.|`|qhLs9gIMaa	wow she has some problems. does her mom know if shes young. if she is young tell her mom. tell her to talk to her and stop. or you should talk to her about her issues.don't stop being friends with her you should try it to because maybe its good.   =p|`|AA11964833	eugggghhhhh that disgusting tell her it is soo unhygenic|`|yTNk4b7Raa	LOLZ.<br>  she has issues.<br>  as long as she don't eat the turd 8-)|`|NBqPF40Daa	okay first of all. GROSS!?!! what kind of person does that?! eww...ok ummm yeah just STOP haning out iwith her. that is totally un sanitary and disgusting. wow. ew
lWolp5Csaa	I honestly think she has a little crush on you.... if you feel the same way you should talk to her about it and tell her how you feel. if she doesn`t feel the way i think she feels ask her if you guyz can be good friends again. think about confroting her about and if it would ruin your friendship.|`|lTNcvqyHaa	Sweetheart you know reading this it is very obvious, you are still about 10 years old and remembering "the old times" the fun and childish times.<br>  <br>  Everyone grows up and changes - you are both 14 and yet a big part of you still wants to be 5 or 8 and have the same fun and same friendship - that is lovely - but it is no longer a reality.<br>  <br>  If you want to be a friend now, change your style. You can go visit her without having an excuse like your Grandma sent you over for some sugar or something. Call her up, tell her you are coming over to your Gran's for the weekend and say " Let's catch up" - go to the mall together and talk about the things you and she are doing now. Ask about her friends and stuff she likes to do now. Don't keep living in the past.<br>  <br>  Be 14 together - talk and share your experiences, and you will always stay friends.
9n00Ur46aa	Well, if you both really love each other, don't you think you should be able to wait and still be in love? I am in a similar situation with my current girlfriend (Dallas vs. KC). We are both finishing up with school before we make that leap. As much as we both realllllllllly want to, we're holding off. That day will be amazing regardless of when it happens. In a way, we both understand we have this thing that needs to be taken care of much like your school and his military service. Both of you have made those commitments for a reason, and I would think if you both love each other that you would encourage and support one another in your ventures.|`|CwBLV9xoaa	I didn't read your whole question but finish school,then you'll have the rest of your life to be with this person.<br>   what would happen if you broke up?

dPpOgny9aa	well,sounds like your boyfriend still respects his X,this is why she is an X.and your boy friend needs to grow some balls,and tell her where to to get off.he needs to tell his X,he is the parent also,and what he does and where they go is his business and not hers,only thing he is required by law is to give his X,the place and phone number to the place he is going out of state,only if going out of state with his son,when he has visitation,if you don't leave the state you tell her he will be home on sunday or which ever day the visitation is over at 1800 hrs.and if his X persist you could get a restraining order that she has no contact with him while he has his son.and i know it cost money(been there done that)but need to hire a lawyer and get his X for contempt of court when she doesn't let him see his son on the days he is to see his son.if he doesn't take control of his life now this will be a on going thing until his son is 18,not good,so best thing to do is talk it out with your boyfriend and come up with a plan of attack on his X,and the problem if not do like pink floyd and RUN,RUN,RUN LIKE HELL!!!!!!!|`|YGYMocGRaa	run!|`|Ot1IFbZBaa	Hit enter a few times.

RISPONSIBILITY.|`|ckJP6TTQaa	Ask the bride. Frankly, it depends a lot on what the bride wants -- although if you think she is being unreasonable, it's fine to google it and make sure what she is asking is a legitimate request. Basically, it is traditional for the M of H to help the bride pick out her dress and the dresses of the bridesmaids, throw a bridal shower (although this is often done by a relative of the bride instead) and throw the bachelorette party. Beyond that, it's all a matter of what the bride needs help with. She might ask you to help with invitations, choosing music, attending alterations appointments, etc. <br>  <br>  Financially, the M of H has all the same obligations as the rest of the bridesmaids -- typically she pays for her own dress, shoes, hair, etc.<br>  <br>  On the day of the wedding, the M of H traditionally is the last of the bridesmaids to enter (although some reverse this) and stands right next to the bride. She holds the bride's bouquet when the bride and groom hold hands and during the ring exchange, and fluffs the bride's dress if necessary. The M of H also gives a toast at the reception. Again, at the ceremony and reception the bride may ask the M of H to help with other things -- like asking guests to take their seats or pouring champagne before the toasts begin.|`|PEMnzRnvaa	you should google it (or go to the bookstore and buy emily post's etiquette) but mostly you just make a speech at the wedding, make sure she gets to the wedding on time, reassure her about everything, you are also in charge of the baccalaureate party|`|DLGRULQ7aa	errrrrmmmm thier duties are to basically help you on your day make sure that your dress is lookin imaculate while standing at the alter, and also to keep any little bridesmaids or paigeboys in check that you have.<br>  hope this helps

I had the same situation and told, then she hit on him and got him. Don't do it. Shes curious and wants to hurt you. After all, she's popular and has nothing to lose.|`|ToxjkJOnaa	if she's not your best friend then don't tell her. you should tell someone who you know you can trust. (like a bestie) only if you feel she can keep secrets then i guess you could tell her.
lWxUn0Xraa	listen i dont know who you are or who this dumb guy is that got you pregnant. all i know is a child is always created by 2 people. taking her father away or having her father avoid his responsibility will only damage your daughter in the end. she deserves a father. i really dont care about you or this guy, i care about her. <br>  statistically girls who grow up without fathers are more likely to be abused by their partners, become teenage mothers and continue this viscous cycle. <br>  be on your daughters side, don't have some strange vendetta against this man. force him to be a father to her. SHE DESERVES IT!
sJZXhPxyaa	think back to when you met your friends you have now - was any of that awkwardness necessary?  nope!<br>  <br>  so, just picture strangers like they're you're future bffs, and that right now its just like that time before when you felt a little awkward around the friends you have now.|`|b9vdlrokaa	just be your self....it helps a LOT

Chances are she's already talked to your friend's mother and knows about your friend, and she's waiting for you to ask about getting a bra. Just ask her when you're in the car somewhere, just the two of you. It will be fine, pet.|`|uB0QueSOaa	i think that you need to sit and talk to your mom and explain to her why you think you need to start wearing bras... she still sees you as her little girl but im sure once you tell her why you want to wear a bra and its not some dumb reason im sure shell give in...good luck...|`|7PbJWEo1aa	tell her that you need some support for PE and you are fed up of bouncing around! trust me, my mum was sooo sooo chuft when i got my first bra - she got really excited because she said I was growing it to a real woman.<br>  <br>  its your body and you need support. I'm now a 30GG so be thankful you don't have to carry that round!!|`|QyP0hDkJaa	People start their periods as young as nine. Your mum maybe doesn't care, or maybe she wants you to be humiliated in high school. You could send her a text... and ask her to buy one when she goes out shopping, i doubt she'll ask any questions. Its also easier.|`|2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	You could start the conversation by asking your mum what age she was when she got her first bra, and then tell her you think you are ready for one now, remember she went through the exact same thing with her mum xxx|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	Just ask"mom can i have a bra?" she should understand|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	Your mom isn't ready to let you grow up yet, but it will be okay! This is what you should do.  Wait until you are shopping with her get yourself and your mom into the dept where you will find the bra's, look at them, pick out a very young looking bra (maybe one with a little bow) then look at your mom and say "I think I'm ready to TRY a bra because I don't know I what it feels like wearing one and sometimes I'm scared but mostly I'm excited about how it might feel to wear <br>  one!"  Well something like this in your own language because you have to warm her up to the idea and how important it is for you and the cute young looking one with little girl trims will warm her up to the idea of you growing in her eyes.|`|UIueiJnZaa	First of all....<br>  DON'T FEEL EMBARASSED!<br>  <br>  Remember that your mother has gone through the exact same thing!<br>  <br>  Just bring up the conversation casually with her, for example... explain that in P.E that you feel uncomfortable as you don't wear a bra (just a suggestion)<br>  <br>  Let her know that it would make you feel more comfortable with yourself, as you feel insecure as you are currently not wearing one.<br>  <br>  This is my best advice, just confide in her, hopeully she will be understanding : )|`|DozD8lTGaa	Tell her exactly that. She cannot stop you from wearing one; it's your body! what if you stopped her from wearing one? loool, just tell her that if she has something to say about it.<br>  <br>  are you young? if she says well you're only young. tell her you feel ready and you know what you want. you don't want to be treated like an 8 year old all your life.<br>  <br>  i think if you talk to her about it, she will think more and maybe that will make her say yes... :)<br>  are you open with your Mum? if not then that would be awkward. but, say what you feel and what you want.<br>  <br>  good luck and i hope i have helped :) x|`|9Ni21lHpaa	You should find  time with ure mom when she's alone and just say that right out, that u think you need a bra,and u should start wearing one,and u need her help figuring out what size,how to wear,where to buy...tell her you have all those questions on your mind...she'll understand...if ure friends have started wearing them,u can also tell her that...she'll understand im sure :)|`|sC3vgYxfaa	When i first started wearing a bra, i told my mom that i want a bra because I'm becoming a woman and i need your help and support. That's what i said and then she bought me a couple. Good Luck!|`|4Sz934Lmaa	just say what you have asked, she will totally understand, remember she went through it too and she probably knows it's scary to ask but it will be worth it :)|`|AA11964833	same i have the sae prob|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Tell mum it's embarrassing for people to see your boobies (or whatever word you can manage to say, sometimes this sort of thing is so embarrassing!) through your top, and you need, now, to wear something between your tops and your skin.  This should, if she's in the room (and not thinking about some other terrible thing) cause her to break out in a sweat of horror.  This is good.  <br>  <br>  Tell her it's time.  Tell her you're getting too embarrassed at school, you're scared everyone is staring at you.<br>  <br>  This is probably true isn't it?  It will probably make you cry: and when you say it she will realise it's important.  I hope she has the money, it could be the problem.  If she is not very rich, find some bras, perhaps tank-top type bras? At the Warehouse or somewhere that she can buy and let her know what they cost.  She may not have a clue and might think they're much more expensive.    <br>  <br>  But of all things, pick a time today when home is quiet.  When she's not yelling at anyone to do anything, when you have time to talk.  And ask to talk to her in private about something important.  Okay?  Show her by how you act that you find this embarrassing and that it's vitally important to you.  If you can't do that, then just print this page out and take it to her and sit quietly while she reads it.  She's probably got so many problems and things on her mind that if you don't really make an impact on her, she doesn't notice.  This isn't her fault by the way: it's the fault of life in this modern world.  <br>  <br>  hang on in there sweetie, you can do this and you'll be fine.  What's embarrassing to us now, once we've got past it, is just a small thing.  You need bras even if only to make the nipples less pointy-outy.  It's got to be done!<br>  <br>  editing: saw your addition:  11 is an appropriate age, but not really for underwires or cup bras, which look a little silly.  Soft bras like sports bras or tank tops at 11, I think, for modesty's sake but not frilly feminine and certainly not padded:  worrying!

0LvWiESWaa	I highly doubt it. Highly.<br>  <br>  Does it sound correct to you that a man who is married would go without sex from his perfectly capable of having sex wife...and be okay with it? <br>  <br>  If she were going to divorce him for you, she would have done it already. People who are having affairs ALWAYS have a reason why they can't leave their spouse just yet. They always have an excuse and it's never a good one if you really think about it.|`|lYx5qn6uaa	It's very possible. The only problem is that with the no sex, the husband might catch on to the affair. And divorce does sound like it's in their near future.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Anything is possible. I knew a couple who had separate rooms for almost ten years (at that time). Divorce wasn't an option in their culture and there were no 'affairs' either. It was purely for economic reasons that they shared the same house.|`|qPmQvqJXaa	Sure, it happens all the time.  People with a home and children have invested alot into their partner.  Its not always easy to walk out and shake apart the life you've built for you kids.  Even if she doesn't want to be with him, divorcing him is a scary thing for her and her kids.  Lots of married people live together as roommates because they don't want to acknowledge that this is happening to their family.|`|sCCjAKllaa	Possibly. Everything you've mentioned shows she's fed up with her marriage. I still don't know about the divorce, though. Many women will utter tons of things about how their husband is vermin or things of that sort, but they would just stay in the marriage regardless. That's the only grey area, but I don't think she's doing anything with her husband.<br>  <br>  That's all you, bro. Cool.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	mm yeah.<br>  my parents<br>  HAH<br>  seriously though... she probably doesn't want to hurt her kids, little does she realize she'll be hurting them more in the long run leading her life this way|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	this is not good<br>  sex and marriage go together.Why get married<br>  <br>  divorce is in the future|`|KqQlWbYsaa	There are married individuals who do not have sex with one another, sometimes by mutual understanding and sometimes otherwise.  That being said, however, I really do not feel that there is enough of a basis for you to believe anything this female says about anything.  I say this because I truly feel that THIS ONE simply wants to have her cake and eat it too; and she is essentially stringing you along.|`|cfkgnbCNaa	What really matters here is that you are ruining her chances for a happy marriage. If she wanted to be divorced, she would be. Leave her alone, and let her family be happy.|`|vt7Ir47raa	O it could be true, when you love someone you want to belive the best, and overlook the worst.|`|1ocRAQ3Gaa	Take this from a fool.......Yes this could be true. She could honestly want out and be avoiding her husband at all cost. Sounds like she wants out but just doesn't know how to get out without hurting everybody and disrupting a bunch of peoples lives. More than likely she is trying to force the husband into straying or doing something wrong so he can be blamed for the whole mess. However, take heed, this woman is dangerous. Keep in mind the old saying, "If they will cheat with you, they will cheat on you". Is this the kind of woman you really want? Will you ever really be able to trust her if she were to get divorced? Go on with your life....and get away from this lady. If she does leave her husband it should be because she wants to not because of you.|`|HUsv9VU9aa	I think he has another woman or man just like she has you. Both of them need communication and need to break this marriage up because there's probably a lot more going on.  Before you know it he will be absent then she will and where does this leave these two unattended children?   Then again i've met people who will lie to their lover just to keep them around and won't feel like crap so to make them feel special they tell them nothing is going on when in fact it's completely the opposite and sometimes almost perfect....but that lover somehow is in the picture...waiting and believing everything. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Y1ffm4Ibaa	Please, please get out of the relationship. No one deserves to be abused, emotionally or physically. Staying in this relationship will not only be harmful to you but also to your son. I would talk to a counselor or social worker, they can give you better advice than I can. But the bottom line is you cannot stay in this relationship.|`|RBF7b58vaa	oh, hun..<br>  wheres your family?<br>  your mom? dad? siblings? aunts or uncles? cousins?<br>  i say go to them, talk to them..<br>  if not..<br>  what about friends?<br>  ask them for advice..<br>  couselor maybe?<br>  i have no clue..but i feel so incredibly bad for you.<br>  im only 15..i dont really know what to say. <br>  im sorry..but perhaps see what your family and friends think about this?<br>  <br>  best of luck, hun.<br>  i hope you can get out of this as soon as possible.|`|2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	You know from experience that this will only get worse. You need to get away from him.  Is there an abuse shelter in your city?  If so, contact them and they can help you. Report what you have told us to the police and have him arrested for domestic violence. Do you have family or friends who can give you a safe place to stay? Don't try to do this alone, have other people that you trust to help you when you start moving things out and make sure that you have a safe place to go and not be alone when you leave.|`|7HB24HPYaa	CALL THE POLICE!!!!!

GHH1i6d3aa	Well for one, you're not falling in love with that other person.  You're falling in love with the idea of that person, and the freedom they represent.  If you have more unhappy moments than happy with your husband, it's time to talk to him and start really working on the relationship.  You may even want to consider counseling.  Marriage has its ups and downs, but you shouldn't be making each other miserable.  Tell him you're considering leaving, he may realize he's pushing you away and change his ways.  Don't be afraid to look at yourself and make some changes too.|`|ehcZAmUVaa	In all marriages there are more unhappy moments than happy ones cause people generally notice the bad more than the good. Since you are financially dependent on the other person and have no where to go and are "falling in love with another person" which I think you are just eager to latch on to another person and get out of your situation and see a way out. I say take it but remember what goes around comes around darling.|`|zBmno58kaa	You tell your spouse that his talking down to you hurts you and makes you feel unloved and humiliated, you then then tell him/her that you're unhappy and have had thoughts of leaving.

But do not make the mistake  of thinking that you can be  deeply  in love with someone you barely know.  Its sounds more like a fantasy type thing to excape from reality.  If you are not happy and counseling does not help, there are shelters, etc that can help, but bouncing back into  another relationship would be a major, major mistake.  If you think you  have some kinship  with this new person, make  sure you give it at least a year after counseling  andf divorce before getting serious or you might end right back into another unhealthy relationship.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Three weeks...you are NOT falling in love.<br>  If you don't want to be married, then end it BEFORE you think about another relationship.

You are lonely, maybe depressed about life and your situation, and are very vulnerable to an affair because it would feel so good.

I am quiet guy myself and when I like a girl I act exactly like the boy you described. But you two have a mutual friend, you could tell that friend that you like the boy and sooner or later the boy will know you have feelings for him as well and he might ask you out. Well, good luck.|`|6yAcFnRmaa	the best way is too find out yourself...<br>  you can't really say that he likes you if he <br>  stares<br>  just take a chance and ask him if he likes you<br>  if he does hope you guys the best
R2T8768Zaa	I know how you feel, I'm pretty quite and shy too, and a lot of people tend to pick at me because I seem like an easy target. But you have to remain true to yourself, which is something I've had a hard time figuring out...myself. But determine where your lines are. How far will you allow people to go before you consider them "crossing the line"? When you've established that understanding of yourself, you'll 'just know' how to handle it. Trust me, when you stand your ground and let someone know they've crossed the line, they learn. People who are willing to jump on your insecurities and exploit them, have a lot of their own issues they're hiding, and they're just as easily intimidated. <br>  <br>  You don't need a mean face or a loud voice to be taken seriously. I rarely ever scrunch my face up in anger and I never yell when people cross the line with me. I sound more like a parent when I reveal my boundaries. Just a simple 'No.' And if they continue on you keep saying 'no, don't go there with me, you won't like the doors you open up.' <br>  <br>  Oh and if they pull that scared, "I'm just joking," bull sh*t, tell them you understand but sometimes joking can go to far, and that was a too far moment.<br>  <br>  Hope I've helped a little. Feel free to e-mail me if you need anymore clarity on what I'm talking about, I'll do my best to help ya out.|`|lTNcvqyHaa	Hi sweetheart <br>  sounds like you already know what you need to do.<br>  <br>  It is lonely being different, shy, thoughtful, reserved - but you are also strong, because 'you don't like to depend on other people' - I say good for you.<br>  <br>  Continue to be yourself - because you are growing and learning to be strong and to take life on the chin - and that is what it all about. These people who pick on you are jealous of you because you are who you are - they don't know who they are so are are just trying to break you down.<br>  <br>  My best advice is to find new friends and blank them. You don't really need to say anything to them except to say "You are bullies and I don't like you for that" and turn and walk away.<br>  <br>  Grow with the flow - you will travel a lot further philosophically than they will.|`|pO0p5O5zaa	If you ignore them, they'll know your weak and probably keep doing it, telling a parent or teacher is good, yet sometimes it can make it worse, but they always have tips and great advice. You can tell them they have absolutely no lives picking on you, and frankly, who cares? They're just a bunch of losers that pick on you for no reason. Be confident and give them the message you don't like being pushed around.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope this helps.|`|gmJAKYTlaa	The best way to stand up for yourself is to use sarcasm or flip whatever they say back on them. Like if a guy says:<br>  <br>  "You have a big a** head!"..."Yes, and we all know how small both of yours are, right?"<br>  <br>  "She's really quiet. She's probably stupid."..."And you're so smart with that F on your report card, huh?"..."Yeah, keep talking about me, you're making me famous."<br>  <br>  Sometimes the best solution is to ignore them, but I'm guessing you've already tried that. But honestly, the next best thing is surprise. Surprise them with what you can do or say.|`|lWolp5Csaa	When it comes to standing up for yourself, you have to be CONFIDENT in yourself. you can`t think of yourself shy and quiet. think of yourself as someone who can stand up for herself and doesn`t let other people make fun..|`|KdRjx7bCaa	depends on what they say. dont say nothing though, show them you wont put up with it.
e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	Just Trust him, and tell him you Trust him.  That will put the pressure on him to do the right thing.  Which it sounds like he wants to do.|`|GOKNG35daa	THATS A LOT TO READ AT ONCE AT LEAST BREAK IT DOWN|`|3wfbcoRxaa	I agree to trust him and to let him know this. And you will see the truth.

There behind all juggalos 110%. You **** with them theyll **** you up. being a juggalette is a way of life They don't give a **** about what the world thinks of them. A Juggalette don't think shes better than everyone else. It's a state of mind, a way of life. To truly understand a Juggalette or juggalo you must be a Juggalette-juggalo Anyone can just Like a Band, that makes you a fan. If your a Juggalette-juggalo your down for anything at anytime. A Juggalette and Juggalo are almost the same but Juggalettes are Females. And no matter how pretty, ugly, fat or crack headed they look, Juggalos love them.

Also, if you are scared that you will have no friends if yiou do speak remember that it is better to be alone and happy (with all your stuff!) than with someone and unhappy.|`|kDFZBNinaa	say ''stop it''! i guess that would work idk sry hahah...|`|s4FEJiNHaa	just talk to her politely about it.  Tell her u don't mind her borrowing ur stuff or whatever, but u really need to know beforehand.  Helping herself to ur belongings without an invitation to do so is not cool!  If this doesn't work, then I suggest strategically placed mousetraps to teach her a lesson.
vbiYLgCHaa	She might of heard a rumor, or something bad that you said. If she is a gullible person, that could be why she is doing that. Maybe, her other friends, don't like you and she is getting peer-presured to not like you. Deep inside, she probably does. Shes probably confused right now. I hope I helped. BEST ANWSER PLEASE(:|`|LmmMosVKaa	well, all i can say is that i know how it feels to lose a friend. But, if you think she's not into you anymore, talk to her, tell her how you feel. See how she reacts. If she tells you that she's not into you, move on... I'm sorry but that's all you can really do|`|lWolp5Csaa	Ok i think that some other popular people spread some rumors about you or something. or they told ur friend if you stop being friends with her u can be popular. if they aren`t popular people at school. maybe she just isn`t a true friend.|`|jpMw2sRPaa	just give her time to come around after a while talk to her she'll get over it
NBqPF40Daa	Well how did you make friends before? Hmmm...easy question...be yourself! lol it sounds totally corny but its so true. The new friends you make will be true friends if you just be yourself. it's okay to feel nervous about going to a new school, but i'll bet you that they're are going to be a lot of other new studnets at your school too and they are going to feel just as nervous. Just dress in what makes you feel great each day and really express who you are to people. don't worry about fitting in with the "in" crowd because you want to be with the people that you can turn to no matter what. high school is the start of the rest of you life. Make choices that you know you won't regret later by hagning outwith the rright people. It's okay you'll be fine. Peace. XD|`|asXHWTK6aa	Walk around the school and ask people, "Will you be my friend if i sucked your dick?"<br>  <br>  I hope i helped, if so, please vote for my answer to be "best answer" thank you!!!|`|W6ZBPsVSaa	im going to high school this year too. so my plans are to act my age and just be myself. thats the best any of us can do

yydPZxjeaa	i think you should realize that whether or not she has had sex really should not affect your relationship with her.<br>  friends should help friends no matter what dumb things they choose to do.<br>  it is hard to be put second in someones life when you used to be first.<br>  but realize that you should be happy for her new love relationship.<br>  most girls will only tell their girlfriends the bad stuff because it makes for better conversation. so assume you probably dont get to hear all aspects of their drama.<br>  one of my best lessons ive learned in life is to leave some details of your relationship to yourself. everyone should not be in the loop and forcing you to possibly make decisions. the people involved know how to deal with their drama the best. the know all the details.<br>  dont let this bother you<br>  this happens with every girlfriend<br>  revolve yourself and hang out with people in the same position as you<br>  but when she does come around, make the time quality.<br>  and as for her boyfriend youre not so fond of, realize she has chosen him. and for you to be a part of her life, you must accept him.<br>  you should be glad youre not in love with him, then there would be even worse problems!!!|`|kXtxJNzPaa	it sounds to me like your friend is so focused on her boyfriend right now, that shes unconsciously pulling away from her friends.<br>  if there is a chance that you would disapprove of her having sex, she might not want to tell you. <br>  you have to make her feel like its ok with you either way and bring it up casually.<br>  just have it naturally come into the conversation. <br>  try to have some kind of girls get together type thing, and talk to her. make it a game if you have to to ease the tension.<br>  if you cant find a way to make it casual, your gonna have to just ask.<br>  if she wants to tell you, she will.|`|laHLW1yQaa	Time to widen your circle of friends and realize that sometimes friends 'fall in love' and dump those they've been with but also know that they can fall out of love too.<br>  <br>  Just widen your circle of friends...see other people...maybe date too...let her have her time with him...let him be to his own devices.<br>  <br>  Ocer time they will most likely break up..your friend will feel bad about that...plus will realize how she treated you and others when she 'was in love'.  Just be there when it happens...don't rub her nose in it ss someday you might meet a guy you do dumb things with and need her.<br>  <br>  As for the sex part...it is going to happen sooner or later with one guy....she chose who and when...her decision...let her share it with you when she is ready.  At some time you will also choose who and when....learn from what you see around you to you make a wise choice.

They have a lot.<br>  I think it's a GREAT idea.<br>  A marriage is not just about the bride and groom when there are kids involved.

It'll be great to make her feel so included!!<br>  You seem like a great, loving mother:D|`|AkUhaMm9aa	it doesn't matter who the father is or who's acting as the father..the marriage in between 2 people and that's why they make toppers for couples...or do you see toppers that include the whole family????<br>  <br>  i think you could mention your daughter on the program or have a photograph you the 3 of you at the guess signing table..that would be nice i think..<br>  <br>  you coul also have one of those plain white toppers..i think they are called family unity or something like that and they include couples with kids..|`|ZH4N6Xdtaa	never heard of the blended marriage thing but that is such a beautiful idea!<br>  <br>  Try looking it up on ebay and maybe go to a cake shop to get them to make it specially for you.|`|y6gVmhHxaa	Your daughter will have a wedding of her own someday, why would you want to put her on your cake topper?

But I wouldn't recommend having a child in the wedding cake topper unless you know for sure that you won't be having any more children. It will be hard enough for the second or third child to look at your wedding pictures and feel sad that his/her older sister was there, but that he/she wasn't. The added element of having the sister represented at the top of the cake would be difficult. It seems strange to pre-emptively avoid sibling rivalry when one of the siblings isn't born yet, but somehow it feels wrong to exclude additional children -- if you're planning on having them. <br>  <br>  It could just be me, though. I am still bitter that my sister got to go to Japan with my parents before I was born.|`|lP04jzv6aa	are there ones?

She'll get her own wedding when she is ready to marry.<br>  <br>  I like the idea of him promising to your daughter that he will accept her as his own, that's fine but the less you make it seem like he's marrying her the more emotionally healthy she'll be.  Placing too much emphasis on her at this time just sets a really weird and warped precedent.

n8lXItGraa	Keep the lines of communication open at all times, even if it hurts.  If he seems not to really care even if you put forth all your effort, he needs to know that his attitude is eating away at you.  Tell him you want to understand his way of thinking.  Maybe he has come to expect you to always be there, and doesn't realize that he is hurting you.  Sometimes in a relationship we become complacent and just expect things to be a certain way. try not to be so....adoring to him.  That might get his attention.

I just didn't really feel like myself.  This sometimes happens this time of year, with all the wacky weather changes and such which can affect your hormones.  I suggest taking some time to do something therapeutic that you really enjoy.  Nature has a natural way of enhancing your mood, so maybe take a walk outside and get some sun.  Go hang out with some friends and let go of any underlying stress.  Even if you are still a little bit tired after that, you will feel emotionally energized and ready to get back down to business.  That's what I did last weekend and even though I stayed up all Saturday night talking with friends, I felt great!  Sometimes we get so caught up in what the world expects of us that we forget about what WE need.  So go ahead, take time for those little "me" moments!  You'll feel much better!  Hope I helped.|`|hpcQI5Viaa	it could be a lot of different things, maybe even just difficulty adjusting to your new lifestyle-you know college life. you could google your symptoms and see what comes up or maybe if you're really not feeling well you should see your doctor... just to make sure everything's good.<br>  good luck!|`|AA10286336	I am sorry to hear you are having this problem. I too am like this. I ended up going to my Dr and was diagnosed with depression. I never thought it would be that, but it is. I have been taking anti-depressants for almost 3 years now and I feel so much better. Its all because of a chemical imbalance in the brain beyond the control of a person and it is nothing to be ashamed of. The chemical is called seritonin. I tried doing everything you are doing now: working out, eating healthier, talking to people more, being around happy people, but I was always tired and no matter what I did, I just felt exhausted and wanted to sleep. Then when I did sleep, I felt guilty because I should be doing so many other things instead. If you have health insurance, I would suggest going to a Dr or clinic and talking to them and see if they can help you. If you are diagnosed with something, it is nothing to feel bad about. Some things happen as a way to tell us to pay attention to our body. Anyway, I wish you the best of luck. God Bless!
0PdYYeBFaa	Okay i wouldn't give my number out like this. <br>  <br>  But this lady simply wants ATTENTION...and i mean in CAPITALS.<br>  I think in a situation like this, you should just take a break to restore your strength and give her time to realize that her behaviour is pathetic...which it is.<br>  <br>  She plays up knowing you will react and respond. You give her too much time of the day and well i think the only way you are going to help her is by taking time away from her. I think she needs to be hit with alone time to reflect and come back to earth in how she can no longer be like this. The things you have stated of her sounds like she is spoiled, an attention seeker and very childlike.<br>  <br>  Do not give into the divorce if you do not want it to go down that lane. But by all means if you want her to fix up, the only thing i think which will work is just going into hiding...make communication hard for her to reach you. She will eventually get tired and bored and have a wake up call. Hopefully this wake up call will change her for the better.<br>  <br>  She seems used too much attention. Now you need to do the reverse of this calmly, wisely and civilized without her knowing as much as possible. Go quiet by all means but do not let her know your tactics and at the same time just ask the Lord to help her become a better person.<br>  <br>  I hope I was of help. best wishes. ;-)|`|AA11286626	I could only read half way, get rid of the lire. That is one lady who needs mental help.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	TMI here. And it was too long I didn't even feel like reading the rest.<br>  You posted your number on here? Are you insane?<br>  Sounds like you are the one with issues, not your wife.|`|uSNn3iJDaa	Wow that's a lot.  From my own personal experience in life I've learned this.....<br>  <br>  Never try to hold on to a person who wants to walk out of your life.  You'd rather have them stay because they want to not because they feel sorry for you.  If they want to go, let them because I promise you there is always another person willing and able to replace them and remain!|`|2ce87ef838b3c546c942a9b12750c8abaa	Jay, I feel for you...but this is not a healthy relationship and I think you already know that.  Sometimes when we break up with people we have to go through a grieving process, just like when we loose someone to death.  In relationships, we think its easier to stay with the person than to deal with the feelings of loss and missing them.  You need to be strong and do what is right for YOU.  By your comments, you already know this relationship is not healthy, just think, do you want another twenty years of these games, arguing, and lies? Really, because if you go back, that's what your signing up for.<br>  Take care of you, no one else will.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	NOT LIKE THIS.<br>  <br>  Are you seriously giving your phone number out here?<br>  <br>  This is way too much information--see a therapist, not Yahoo Answers.<br>  <br>  This is supposed to be for fun and entertainment purposes.|`|n8lXItGraa	Wow..let me read the whole thing..<br>  <br>  Your woman is an attention seeker.  She also can't decipher the truth from a lie.  She has tried to wrap you around her finger with her mind games.  This 36 year old woman has the maturity level of 13 year old in case you hadn't noticed.  I can understand her pain during her first marriage just from what you've stated here, but to treat you the way she has does not justify anything.  It almost sounds like you're being punished because of her past relationships.  She asked for a divorce...but then doesn't know where the place is to file.  She's playing you again.  She wants you to fight to get her back..and then what?  Things will always be like this, she knows no other way.  My opinion...for what it's worth...file for divorce or separation yourself.  You sound like a nice guy and you don't deserve all this deception.  Let her go off into the sunset with her boy toy.  Oh...I can almost guarantee there isn't a boy toy either.  Hope this helps....
IxLj8bBZaa	Sorry, I have many thoughts on this, because it's a complicated issue that can't be answered in a single sentence!<br>  <br>  1. Sometimes people who seem gay actually aren't. When a guy is into manicures, skin care, and dressing well, he might be what they call a "metrosexual", i.e., a straight dude who has interests that used to be stereotypes of gay men. Same thing with straight girls, but not as much--sometimes tomboys get mistaken for lesbians.<br>   <br>  2. One reason your classmate might not "come out" (if he's actually gay) is that some people don't like to be labeled. <br>  <br>  3. Maybe he's not 100% gay. Or maybe he's not sure yet. <br>  <br>  4. I believe it's none of our business who is gay and who is straight unless *they* want us to know (or unless you are dating them, of course.) Some want to come out as gay or bi, and others like to keep their sex lives private. I even have a friend who is neither gay nor straight--he never liked having sex with anyone, and keeps it a secret because he knows people would judge him harshly for being a true asexual person. (an asexual never has sex with anyone, except maybe himself--my friend just isn't interested in it!)<br>  <br>  5. Please try to avoid using the word "admit" when asking about sexual orientation. "Admitting" something means you're making a confession, revealing a shameful secret, or fessing up to a mistake. Use "admit" in other sentences to see what I mean: "I admit it, I lost your keys." "He admitted that he stole the ipod." "I admit to being a fool."<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to be mean to you or others who say "admit." I only point this out because it's an easy way to offend someone who is gay. Asking them to "admit it" sounds like you've already judged them and that you think homosexuality is wrong. Just a handy tip--I'm sure you said "admit" because that's such a common phrase. to "admit you're gay."|`|QaT680QHaa	Most wait until they are out of school. Like the first person said he is probably afraid of being harassed<br>  If the person is truly gay they will "come out" when they feel comfortable with it|`|4rLdaCNHaa	They will announce it if and when they are ready.<br>     And who says they have to announce anything, did you?? <br>     I mean, ppl say you had all the looks of girl, the ways of a girl, but did you announce you were...or did ppl just take that for granted and accept you for your looks and behaviors ?<br>     The word for his actions, voice or behaviors, may be "effeminate", but that doesn't make one gay. It just so happens some guys are like that until they've gone through puberty.<br>     It's not like your responsible for "you" looks, voice and physical gestures, much of your personality, that all happened genetically, so don't be judging others so quickly when you've been handed "all" that.<br>     Try just accepting ppl for the differences, reasons and whys don''t matter and it isn't really your business unless the owner decides to make it, but it would be a pretty boring life and society if one were just another copy of all the others.|`|AEeVStHfaa	I guess when his ready to admit it. He probraly doesn't want to say anything because he doesn't want to be mistreated, bullied, or anything like that.|`|xwfdn6Xkaa	It depends on the individual if he would like to disclose that information to you.

qFLlggY5aa	It's my theory that: <br>  a pretty girl with allot of makeup is still pretty or prettier... a girl who isn't that pretty who puts on allot of makeup can look even worst.

If a guy says they don't like makeup, they probably mean that. The best thing I could say is this:<br>  <br>  Guys that say they don't like makeup probably don't like their partner to wear a lot of makeup because it makes them look fake.. they like natural beauty. However, the girls and celebrities like you say will wear a lot of makeup and still get attention.<br>  <br>  That look is attractive because it's been mentally embedded into people's brains. Even if a guy likes how that looks, it doesn't mean he still can't say he doesn't like girls that wear makeup.|`|lL1zNvzJaa	yeah well thats different shes famous.<br>  but all the guys i know say that but then they always go for the girls that look so fake and where to much.|`|Tf19RETiaa	her makeup really isnt that heavy =/|`|XsgP1O7gaa	I think it's the way girls apply make up. You can still have a natural look with make up on. I use Avon Mouse Foundation its great, and suits my skin to the tee. I use a small amount of lipgloss, and some masacrra. It looks good! But when am going on a night out, my look totally changes. It totally matters with colours, the way you apply it and what suits you.

Strike up a friendship, get to know him if you don't already. But I think if what you're saying is true, then there might be some interest going on here. Communication is key! And if you're comfortable with it, maybe you can ask HIM out. It saves a lot of time.
4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	You're not pathetic. This is a fairly common position to be in, actually.<br>  <br>  High risk, high reward. The more you care, the more you will be torn apart if things deteriorate. I think you should go for it, but at the same time protect yourself.<br>  <br>  You can increase the intimacy of the relationship w/o having sex. I think you should wait to have sex until you feel confident that he's attracted to in ways outside the physical sense.<br>  <br>  The other way to go here is to have sex w/ him right now and see if he cuts and runs. The idea being that you find out if that's all he really ever wanted all along before you've actually let yourself fall for him.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, (24 y/o guy, if that impacts the meaningfulness of my advice) you will be less scarred in the long term if he leaves you b/c he can't stand being withheld from the sex, since that's all he wanted, as opposed to doing it with him and then having him jump ship. Feeling the way you do already, you will undoubtedly become more invested in the relationship by sleeping with him.<br>  <br>  A word of caution... he may try to tell you that his feelings are sincere and deep for you, but that he just needs sex so bad that he can't stay in a relationship w/ a woman if he's not getting any. That, in my view, is inherently dishonest b/c nobody needs it THAT bad. In my experience w/ girls that I know, guys who say that are already fed up w/ her and think she's a jerk for holding off on sex and cutting him off. So they manipulate the situation to wearily convince her to have sex before she's really ready b/c he feels like he deserves that from her for being all fake nice for months w/o getting p*ssy in return. So, if he goes this route w/ you, then definitely don't give in b/c it means that the relationship is already over.|`|TsoXZKSyaa	In every [real] relationship you become vulnerable to the other person, and they have great potential to hurt you, but you trust them not to, and that is what gives you such a good connection.  Here you're worried that he may not feel the same, a way that I think you can tell is by not giving him everything he wants. Like, don't be all over him, doing everything you can for him, keep your guard up (in order to not get hurt, and to test him) and see what he does, see if he thinks it's worth chasing you, if it is then you can tell he really likes you :). Like if you're not being THAT devoted to him, and he still says sweet things to you, then you can tell that he's into you, and not just using you for physical attraction.<br>  <br>  However, trust your gut instinct, because if he tries to do anything and it doesn't feel right, and you feel like your being used, do NOT ignore that honey, that will leave you devistated when you find  out that you could be right :(. <br>  <br>  I'd say play it by ear right now, give him a chance to prove himself without too much encouragement :). (but don't be cold to him, just not so desperately all over him :))<br>  <br>  good luck!!! Hope things work out for you :).

KRJ7h8MYaa	Well, it ultimately depends on how you want to look at things. <br>  <br>  Those "excuses" could actually very well be true, you know. They are perfectly valid reasons for a man to avoid seeing a particular (or, just maybe in general) woman. <br>  <br>  Or indeed, as you claim, he just may not be that into you, after making a proper evaluation of who you are as a person. <br>  <br>  I think that the bigger point here is, "Who knows? Who cares? LET GO!!"<br>  <br>  I notice that a lot of women (as I've seen in the popular mainstream media anyway) have a harder time with the concept of "letting go." I think that one of the messages in this book might not be just about the fact that he "might not be into you", but also about the fact that women should not be so preoccupied about making excuses for men in an attempt to justify some sort of breakup or rejection. They should just learn to move on. In a way, thinking of the statement "he's just not that into you" might just do that, because it places the "negativity", so to speak, on the woman than on the man, who "just isn't into the girl!" As a result, to avoid such negativity, the best thing to do is to move on. <br>  <br>  For example, I read about this group of female physicians who enjoyed going clubbing together every so often. They found that they were being rejected quite often when approaching guys. They immediately attributed it to the fact that the guys were "intimidated" of the fact that they were "successful" (I don't even know if they were good doctors or not) because of the fact that they had a "degree." WOW. In any event, they conducted this little experiment amongst themselves. When they approached guys, they would claim to be a physician half of the times, and the other half of the times they would claim to be a teacher. They found that when claiming to be a teacher, the guy wasn't as apt to look for an escape as they would be when claiming to be a doctor. But it wasn't the results of this study which amused me. I had actually expected that. But the fact that, first of all, the women had gone to such lengths to conduct the study in the first place, and, secondly, that these bright and intelligent (detect the hint of sarcasm, please) physicians had attributed it to the fact that the men were "intimidated" made me laugh so hard that I eventually developed the hiccups. Who are they to judge the question as to why they ran away? What if the guy who had run away actually wanted to become a physician himself, but couldn't because his parents lived in the ghetto and had no money to send him to college, and so he had to work straight after high school to keep his family alive? What if he had a stuttering problem and thus was refused acceptance to medical school (despite having the top grades)? And because of these aforementioned reasons, he was jealous of ANYONE who was a physician? Can you blame him for absconding from a potential conversation from you?<br>  <br>  Or, what if you told the guy that you were a physician not right after meeting him, but perhaps after having a conversation with him for a few hours (thus allowing the guy to better understand your personality)? What if?<br>  <br>  Or, he might very well be intimidated. But why should it matter to you so much? The fact is, you're probably better off not being with these guys anyway! Sure you'll have to wait a little longer, but patience is one of the most underrated virtues today, isn't it? <br>  <br>  Instead of letting go and moving on, they decided to conduct a little experiment by lying to some good, decent, honest people. Methinks that it is the physicians who were being shallow and taking things a little too personally here (and I'm not being sexist, I'm sure there are many guys who have conducted similar informal experiments as well, I say that they are shallow and insecure too)!<br>  <br>  So yeah...lol...I do agree with the messages in this book which you have stated in your query. But I think an even bigger and more broadly applicable message is to "let go and move on." Don't try to change guys. Don't try to find reasons for their rejecting or breaking up with you, which you are in no position to judge anyway. Only the guy can tell you why he had rejected you or broken up with you, and he may be uncomfortable to discuss it with you, or he may be lying, who knows. This "male-bashing" has just gone on too far to the point that we're being made to look like the bad people in every scenario. Just let go and move on. For everyone's good.<br>  <br>  LOL yeah that was a good study break for me!! :P|`|TthDWtPTaa	absolutely

You're just afraid because you don't know him that well. I'd get to know him more and find out what he is really like, in person.<br>  And yes you are stupid haha you shouldn't just burst out that you like him now you said you don't because it'd be too soon. So just wish for the best that he doesn't decide to go fter someone else cos he thinks you don't like him.

Nc7clhzIaa	First of all, stop turning away when he looks at you.  He will think you don't like him if you keep shutting him off like that.  I know, I used to be just like that.  If he smiles at you, smile back.  Get his attention sometimes.  If he is looking at you or sitting by you, ask him a question like... " Do you have an extra pen, my ink is running out. " Those simple little questions can show that you chose to ask him out of anyone else.  Draws his attention more.  I would not ask directly b/c that would maybe turn him away.  Subtle moves is the key.  It seems like he does like you though, since he is moving closer & closer. hehe|`|87e42b12d9375f23a7f6007b19387ae4aa	i would suggest a simple approach between the time they give you your little milk cartons and nap time. this will be when hes most approachable. maybe ask him to share a cookie.|`|FmvnC8keaa	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Studying his body language. Also, when he stares at you he shouldn't do it  for a long time, and when you look up he should look away. If he just stares then that means it is a physical attration. Here is a way to tell. <br>  He lifts his eyebrows. When a man sees someone he's into, he'll automatically lift and lower his eyebrows, wrinkling his forehead in the process. But you'll have to keep your eyes peeled to catch a glimpse of this telltale signal. Anthropologists call it the eyebrow flash because it's usually lightning-quick.<br>  He stands with his legs spread apart. A guy will often stand with his legs spread apart and pelvis facing you when he's attracted to you. It's a primal, biological instinct, and most guys don't even know they're doing it.<br>  He stands or sits with his toes pointed toward each other. This means he's feeling a little unsure of himself. So if a boy in the club is striking this pose, he's digging you but needs reassurance that the interest is mutual.<br>  He smiles with his top lip stretched wide and his front teeth are just barely peeking through. This tight-lipped look is a polite signal that while he enjoys your company, the romantic spark may not be there. but that doesn't mean his feelings can't develop.<br>  He holds a looong, piercing gaze. Although you may think he's smitten, he could be playing you. Holding intense eye contact for more than five sedonds doesn't happen naturally, so he may be using the look solely as a player's technique to get what he wants.<br>  He tilts his head slightly to the side when your eyes meet. The head tilt is a subconscious come-hither signal that the guy has feelings for you. So if that man you've been meeting eyes with for the last hour gives you the head tilt, that's your cue to go in for the kill and introduce yourself.<br>  He half smiles. There's a good chance this guy just wants a no-strings fling. "A sneerlike grin is an indication that he's not being sincere with you," points out body-language expert Patti Wood. "it's a split-face gesture: Each side of his face is telling a different story."|`|RvpFtbYlaa	Look before you fall. My advice is to become friends with him- all it takes is a "hey, what was the science homework?" After you become more comfortable around him, try some harmless flirting. If he doesn't feel mutual, at least you have a great friend. Then you can move on and meet other boys.|`|texnwiJxaa	you answered your own question?<br>  he moved to sit by you!<br>  not to be rude but yes he likes you<br>  just talk to him about sports or music<br>  all guys love at least one of these|`|AA11263103	1.

fL8QIhfyaa	It doesn't need to be complicated ..love should be easy! If you truly love your boyfriend you wouldn't want to be with another man. If you have developed feelings for someone else than maybe there is something lacking in your relationship with your boyfriend. Either way though it's not fair to string anyone along so decide if you want to give this new guy a shot or stay focused on your man. You're young so something new could be good but sometimes the grass is not greener on the other side and your boyfriend might not wait around to take you back!
