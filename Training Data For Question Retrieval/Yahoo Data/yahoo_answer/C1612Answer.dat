Also, you'd need some source of electricity for your lighting, refrigerator, and possibly heating and cooking.  Also, depending on where you'll be, some RV parks may have a maximum length of time for which you'll be allowed to stay.

Oh I forgot to mention we have one as well paid $5000 for it and the fridge broke then the shower cracked and a few other things and it is about 10 years old. The biggest deal is finding nice and safe places to park them. Get a city in mind and research RV parks and look at crime and stuff. The friends I know that do this have to pay a pretty penny to stay in the nicer parks that are safe. Good luck!

To be a legal UK resident (and be able to work legally) you have to gain resident status from the government.  Basically, you have to prove that you are able to support yourself without any public assistance.  In fact, if you try to apply for public assistance you'll be deported.  The cost of living in the UK is much higher than in the US, and since they have a 40% tax rate take-home pay is lower than in the US.  If you do not graduate high school you won't be able to get any sort of decent job.  My husband and I were approved to immigrate to the UK, we're both college graduates, he earns over $100k per year and we were barely qualified.

wVsjgj35aa	I don't think people misunderstand it,including you. It's a question of the Ethnic State versus the Modern State. In a Modern State "nationality" is simply a matter of citizenship,which everyone has as a birthright. In an ethnocracy ethnic/racial identity is merged with nationality,creating a society dominated by one ethnic group,who for obvious reasons will want to keep it that way. Why? Because it is advantageous to them and because they fear revenge should the tide change so to speak. Fear is an important element since it leads to unspeakable brutality carried out by otherwise normal people; they feel their aggression is actually defensive. Think what would happen if the untermenschen took over! Think what they would do to us! And so on. So they feel anything is justified to "protect" themselves - the status quo - when in fact their "protective" measures are actually aggression and simply provoke more opposition or counter-aggression. But ultimately it all goes back to a false linkage between ethnicity and nationality. As long as that linkage persists you will have the usual Us v. Them mentality,with plenty of blood shed on both sides,action leading to reaction leading to reaction to reaction etc etc etc. There is only one way to break this chain of antipathetic responses and that is dissolution of the concept of the ethnic state,in order words the idea that nationality and ethnicity are one and the same,a core belief if not the very core itself of Zionism. <br>  <br>  In a modern state anyone born within it's borders is of that state's nationality. Race and ethnicity are not factors. The Turko-Germans are now into their third generation as Germans. They started migrating there in the early 70's; today most of them were so to speak born German. They are considered German. They aren't ethnic Germans. But they are German nationals. Meanwhile out in North Dakota almost everyone is an ethnic German but they are not German nationals,they are German-Americans. During the Hitler era all German citizens who were not ethnically German were de-naturalized; meanwhile any ethnic German from anywhere on earth could go to Germany and claim citizenship even if he did not plan on staying there. <br>  The problem with such a mentality is that it hearkens back to the era of the tribal state and is thus utterly dissonant with the modern state. It is fundamentally atavistic. Zionism is atavistic. But Zionists whether Jewish or Christian cannot accept the idea. In a phrase they "just don't get it" when you try to explain that Zionism incorporates the ethnic state as it's most fundamental principle and this is the source of all the friction it generates both internally and internationally. In a Modern State multi-ethnicity is very much the norm and so as the world itself evolves world culture in general becomes more diversified; ethnic pride is no longer conducive to violence because there is no link between national identity and ethnic identity.  There is no Us v. Them. Why? Because national identity has superceded racial/ethnic identity. So there is plenty of room for the latter without it disrupting the nation. Ethnic pride is not a threat in the Modern State because it is not placed above nationality. <br>  <br>  As to returning your library books on time I think you are depriving yourself of the sport of it all when it comes to  fines. Where I live you don't have to pay until it reaches five dollars. So I always pay $1 when it reaches $4 so I don't have to pay the whole five thus thwarting the library since under those conditions I always owe them several dollars and there's nothing they can about it. However,if I let it slip over $4 I don't get my privileges back unless I pay in full. So it's a very stimulating little game of cat and mouse. <br>  <br>  I do what I can to enrich my daily life. It is filled with adventure as you see. I guess I'm just a born risk-taker.|`|ymXlF9Rnaa	Had PA Arabs stopped suicide bombings and other acts of terrorism the security fence wouldn't of had to be built, the world calls it illegal, and create protests against it, where were these people when Israelis were getting blown up on buses and restaurants.

In that sense it is indeed a product of racism: anti-Jewish racism.  If the Afrikaners feared cultural extinction, the Jews justifiably feared physical extinction, from the Arabs as well as from the Nazis.<br>  <br>  Zeno is delusional to suggest that Israel is atavistic.  Israel is surrounded by hostile people and countries that aspire openly to its destruction, and have called for killing Jews, and acted on those calls, since long before the establishment of Israel. When these people enter the modern age, Israel will be able to experiment with multiculturalism.  It actually already does much more than the surrounding countries, because, for example, there are no living Jews in Jordan.  Pot calling the kettle black.  To pretend that the Jews caused the hostility is to invert history.|`|PHQy22VUaa	Apartheid in South Africa  ended. as the apartheid nation of Israel should.  everyone is sick of the jews hypocrisies.

The Israelis believe that if they  do not do all kinds of work, easy and hard, skilled and unskilled, they would have become landlords then this will not be their  homeland.The following is a very interesting quote There is still one other question arising out of the disaster of nations which remains unsolved to this day, and whose profound tragedy, only a Jew can comprehend. This is the African question. Just call to mind all those terrible episodes of the slave trade, of human beings who, merely because they were black, were stolen like cattle, taken prisoner, captured and sold. Their children grew up in strange lands, the objects of contempt and hostility because their complexions were different. I am not ashamed to say, though I may expose myself to ridicule for saying so, that once I have witnessed the redemption of the Jews, my people, I wish also to assist in the redemption of the Africans.”<br>  <br>  — Theodor Herzl<br>  Today, within Israel, Jews are a majority, but the Arab minority are full citizens who enjoy equal rights. Arabs are represented in the Knesset, and have served in the Cabinet, high-level foreign ministry posts (e.g., Ambassador to Finland) and on the Supreme Court. Under apartheid, black South Africans could not vote and were not citizens of the country in which they formed the overwhelming majority of the population. Laws dictated where they could live, work and travel. And, in South Africa, the government killed blacks who protested against its policies. By contrast, Israel allows freedom of movement, assembly and speech. Some of the government's harshest critics are Israeli Arabs who are members of the Knesset.<br>  <br>  The situation of Palestinians in the territories is different. The security requirements of the nation, and a violent insurrection in the territories, forced Israel to impose restrictions on Arab residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip that are not necessary inside Israel's pre-1967 borders. The Palestinians in the territories, typically, dispute Israel's right to exist whereas blacks did not seek the destruction of South Africa, only the apartheid regime.<br>  <br>  If Israel were to give Palestinians full citizenship, it would mean the territories had been aPalestiniansIsraeli government has been prepared to take that step. Instead, through negotiations, Israel agreed to give the Palestinians increasing authority over their own affairs. It is likely that a final settlement will allow most Palestinians to become citizens of their own state. The principal impediment to Palestinian independence is not Israeli policy, it is the unwillingness of the Palestinian leadership to give up terrorism and agree to live in peace beside the State of Israel.<br>  <br>  Despite all their criticism, when asked what governments they admire most, more than 80 percent of Palestinians consistently choose Israel because they can see up close the thriving democracy in Israel, and the rights the Arab citizens enjoy there. By contrast, Palstinians place Arab regimes far down the list, and their own Palestinian Authority at the bottom with only 20 percent saying they admire the corrupt PA regime.|`|Kik3epkVaa	In both cases the goal was to transplant a bit of Europe to a non-European continent and simply impose it's will by force. The analogy between R.S.A. and the G.O.I. is very accurate. Both are a product of cultural chauvinism.

Plu6OVoGaa	Bring a sweater because it's been unseasonably cool lately. The weather's gone bipolar!!!|`|AA10855383	yeha the weather is bipolar.. i think one day it was in the 80's then the next day it was like in the 60/50 and we had another freeze warning over night (i live 2hr north of orlando) then today it was warm... just check yahoo weather, dress as if its spring/summer in the day time (if its warm) and at night still bring a jacket cuz it might be cool|`|XzLUA7ataa	Bermuda shorts are probably fine during the daytime, but our evenings are rather chilly.

bGdTivxqaa	Learn some Russian basics.  You can advance your studies and gain fluency while in Russia, but knowing the basics before arrival will help you assimilate faster and enjoy it!|`|AA11835015	if you have a sponsor, a family in russia to care for you, you will be like a real member of the family. how will you get a visa? you will need a "vid na zhitel'tsvo" a green card, so to speak. if it is a business visa, i think all the legalities will be covered by your company.<br>  if you come in summer, don't worry about warm clothes. what you buy here (russia) will be more suited than usa's version of winter clothes. if you have good sweaters already, bring one or two. denim jeans seem to fight the cold better than cargo pants. many clothes here are chinese and of lower quality than american imports from china. bring jeans. winter boots are best if russian made, not chinese. heavy boots with an inch sole of felt keep your feet warm in any -40 temperature. gloves are usually dress style, maybe good leather ski gloves from usa are a good idea. usually i get chinese, but this year i can't find them big enough and my THINsulate are just that... thin! <br>  <br>  prepare to enjoy food! excellent ice cream, sausages, candies, breads, (black bread is like no other!!) you will likely walk a lot, too. cities are compact. in texas my hometown is 3000 people. in russia, we live in a town of 120,000 and the plat of the city would fit exactly! well, close!<br>  <br>  if you are Christian, (or not- if it does not conflict with your beliefs) consider attending the russian orthodox church. it is simply religious, not a social place like american churc. that is we don't have evening dinners with the well to do of the church. there are also mosques in many cities if you are islamic.<br>  <br>  if you drink alcohol, be responsible. avoid mixing vodka and champagne. wine and vodka are bad on me if mixed! but a hundred grams (3 ounces) is cool.|`|vTra7n5baa	Prepare for a big cultural difference and for Russians not to care about as many little emotional things as Westerners do.  We are a tough people, but that doesn't mean we are uncaring.  Also, expect quality of life to be lower.  Russia is still a developing country and if you want Western things, you really have to pay dearly for it.  People also dress a lot more sexy and provocative in Russia.  It's a part showing that you are a real man or woman.  And, IT WILL BE COLD IN WINTER!<br>  <br>  If you can accept these things and understand many other things too, then you should be fine.  Just learn Russian and understand that there are not bears walking on the streets of Moscow or any other large Russian city.

At the age of 15 you should not even think about smoking anything. Do you know what smoking marijuana does to you sonny boy? It kills your brain cells, yup it kills them one by one. You will eventually be as stupid as a rock.<br>  <br>  You will not find any "420" parties around here, and you know why? Because smoking marijuana or carrying it around with you is illegal here in South Florida and you will indeed get fined or jail time. The only way you would find a "420" party is if you had one of your own.<br>  <br>  The fact that you mentioned that you were 15 makes me look down even more upon you. If you think smoking marijuana makes you "cool" then your wrong. What makes you cool is being successful in life and marijuana can't do that for you because you'll be living in Fairy Tale land 24/7. <br>  <br>  You may read this and tell me to screw off, but what I'm saying is the truth.

3fHZOobiaa	France <br>  <br>  16; for drinking strong liquor on premises: 18.<br>   It is not customary to request identification, unless the person is manifestly of inappropriate age. It is, however, illegal to sell alcohol to a minor under 16.

People aged 16 and 17 may consume wine, beer or cider with a table meal, provided they are with an adult and an adult orders it. (England & Wales only, Scotland no adult required to be present ). The legal age for the purchase of liqueur chocolates is 16. Children under 5 must not be given alcohol unless under medical supervision or in an emergency (Children and Young Persons Act 1933, Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Act 1937).<br>  Purchasing alcohol on behalf of a minor is illegal in England, Scotland and Wales.|`|eoQoCcz5aa	Not sure about France but in England it's about 10 , cheerio .|`|ygGr1nX7aa	There is no 'Drinking age' per se in England or the rest of the UK.  You have to be 18 to enter a bar or buy alcohol, but you're allowed a glass of wine with a meal in a restaurant at 15 (I think, may be 14), and there is no legal limit at all on minors drinking in private places or functions.

CwrayzxBaa	Our national sporting colours are the colours from our national flower, the Golden Wattle (green and gold).   Our sporting colours have always traditionally been green and gold.  However they were officially proclaimed as green and gold by our former governer-general, Sir Ninian Stephen, in 1984.   The use of the colour were also helped by the use of the Boxing Kangaroo flag (which uses the same shades) used in the 1987 America's cup campaign and every international sporting event since.   <br>  <br>  It should be noted that during the olympics our team typically wears the colours of the flag during the opening ceremony and then the green and gold during the events.  The only time I recall this happening different was during the opening ceremony of the Sydney 2000 games.  There the Australian athletes were dressed in green and gold ochres in a Manga design.<br>  <br>  Footnote:  The Boxing Kangaroo emblem was originally painted by an Australian airman on a B-52 bomber during WW2 that flew over Germany.  They were later added to the Australian Airforce planes used the Pacific Theatres during that time.

CluOq6hmaa	Here's a shopping directory site I like to use:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.intletail.com/canada" rel="nofollow">http://www.intletail.com/canada</a><br>  <br>  It lists all sorts of online shops that ship to Canada.|`|BpxDSiOHaa	Most places in the world ship to Canada. I have bought things on Ebay from all over the US and Canada. Amazon is the same. The US has some things you can't buy in Canada, so online shopping is actually more prevelant in Canada than in the US. So, in a sense, you are speaking to the experts.|`|2wyDALHgaa	You really can't go by perceptions based upon what may show on ebay.com vice ebay.ca.  It's the same thing as people who have accounts on yahoo.com (us) vice people who have accounts on yahoo.ca.  The simple fact of the matter is that many people, regardless of their nationality, will sign up for accounts or use the services of  the main site rather then their smaller national sites.  Many Canadians go right for yahoo.com or ebay.com or walmart.com even before they think to go to the .ca versions.  Realistically they are all linked together actually so it makes no difference.<br>  <br>  As for Canadian's use of online shopping portals, based upon what I know from my own shopping habits and those of friends, I'm sure we use it as much if not more then American and any other nationalities out there.|`|Pr3QIlweaa	(First answer!  Wahoo!!)<br>  <br>  Uh...Canada has (I believe) the highest percentage of Internet users in the world.  <br>  <br>  (84.3% of Canadians use the Internet, as opposed to just 72.5% of Americans.)  (Australia is 79.4% and Japan is 73.8%.)<br>  <br>  We kind of have to, since it's the second largest country in the world, with only about 33,000,000 people.  That means there can be vast distances between customers and their goods and services.

aj5IBTuXaa	I like several parts of living in NOLA.<br>  <br>  First, the food cannot be beat.  It is awesome.  (Be prepared to hate yourself for your weakness and the diets you will need to watch.)<br>  <br>  Second, our climate is great if you like hot but don't like cold.  Our winters are just fabulous.  I have spent many Januaries in shirtsleeves during the day and light sweaters at night.<br>  <br>  Third, if your genre of music is either R&B, Zydeco & Cajun, or Dixieland Jazz, you will be in music heaven.<br>  <br>  Fourth, we have a party atmosphere here.  Casual, relaxed, not so totally uptight as to be insane.  We believe that life is too short to not try to enjoy it more.  So on weekends, usually there is a festival of some sort within an hour's drive of the city.  I think I saw this once on a calendar designed to show festivals.  If you limit yourself to one tank of gas for the round trip, you have a festival either 49 or 50 weekends out of the year.  (Depends on the economy.)<br>  <br>  Despite the presumption that we are crazy for living below sea level, we are doing fine.  (By the way, if you built a house where mudslides or earthquakes or tornadoes or eaves-high snow accumulation in blizzards are common, why is that so different from us?)<br>  <br>  Which isn't to say that this is Heaven on Earth.  The drivers here should have more accidents than they do - to thin the herd.  And all to many of them are dumber than a box of rocks.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you think we have bad politics, I have one word for you.  Blagojevich.  I have another one for you:  Stevens.  (You know, the Senator from Alaska.)<br>  <br>  See?  We have no lock on bad politics.  It's all a matter of publicity as to whose bad politics crops up in the headlines this week.<br>  <br>  Things to consider about New Orleans that some folks don't like:<br>  <br>  We are not a strong barbecue town, restaurant-wise.  If you like BBQ, do your own.<br>  <br>  We are not a strong beef town.  More seafood, chicken, and pork here because of those being primary to Creole cuisine.  Beef is not a strong player in that style.<br>  <br>  Since Katrina, some folks have become more belligerent about how the government, insurance companies, and charity agencies have abandoned us.  Those groups really haven't abondoned us, but the visible progress is very slow and that frustrates a lot of people.|`|zgDQrI2uaa	My favorite part of living in NOLA and in it's metro area is that it is HOME.  When I was evacuated for that 4 weeks after Katrina, I thought I was going out of my mind.  The food in the groceries wasn't right, the accents weren't right, no one knew anyone I knew, the sense of humor other people had wasn't right, no one would talk to me in line; sigh, nothing was right.  <br>  <br>  I am used to traveling for weeks on end, but when someone says you can't go home because it's not there anymore, there is nothing else like home.  I came back to utter destruction and 3 feet of mud and lived in a tent with no running water, no stores, no gas, nothing, and was THRILLED to do it, just to be home.|`|L6ILAJ3Baa	Ha ok well I have been living in Louisiana for my whole life of 15 years =P, but that is still long enough to do some great things here.  My favorite part of living in the New Orleans district is the awesome food.  No where in the world has the great food like we do down here.  I also love to just spend a day walking around the French Quarter and look at everything.  So I hope you have a great time living down in NOLA!|`|fEvEPJjEaa	A lot of folks talk about how dumb people from Louisiana are , but consider this, anyone who builds a city below sea level , in the middle of a hurricane prone area, and fills it with democrats, can't be to dumb.|`|AyiDXBTxaa	The carefree culture that hasn't diminished in 400 years.|`|HgfIn4LTaa	What part of New Orleans are you moving to?

I am wanting you to be alert and not aloof until you know your surroundings.<br>  <br>  Food, oh yes, the central grocer in the French Quarter has the best muffalatta (sandwich.)<br>  <br>  Great people make a great city. Find your closest cafe or diner, and bring a book. Order a tea or Coffee and pretend you are reading. And instead be the fly on the wall and listen to the old timers you can hear their smiles in their voices. The city is total culture. When you are comfortable introduce yourself.

V8gON6VUaa	Good luck! It's peak season here now so you won't find anything in Vail. I would definitely call some of the local hotels to see what they've got because the lodges are really hurting. Lionshead Inn, Evergreen Lodge, Antlers at Vail, etc. The closest you'll probably get for around $110 is in Eagle, CO. Eagle is about 45 minutes west of Vail and 30 minutes west of Beaver Creek. The Comfort Inn in Eagle has rooms for $119/night or so.

SU6AP3t5aa	ok dont give up yet on the disney thing with a little reasearch and a few budget tips   you still might be able to pull it off   first look at budget lodging you want be in room much anyway    book  air fare if needed  and rooms for week days not weekends   if you do that you will save  a ton    if driving even better that way you can bring ice chest   and eat some meals in roon buy sandwhich stuff  and snacks cold drinks all cheaper if not gotten out  you have to decide where to cut cost by deciding what really matters  a  meal in a nice restraunt or a trip tp disney|`|YfIm4IqSaa	Miami Beach is a very party friendly city. If you want something less urban and more relaxed I'd go to a place like Key West. Otherwise I'd recommend a place like Virginia , I know that place is pretty however I've never been there before.|`|SdYkfw2naa	you could still go to california, but visit hollywood or universal studios, if you are into that... <br>  New york to see broadway plays.<br>  Minneapolis for the mall of america... for a shopping spree<br>  Or you could give your room a makeover. just some ideas. <br>  hope this helps:)
tQsxsuNPaa	Are you going with a tour?  Haven't they already gone over that? <br>  <br>  about $10 - 15/day for food...so you have enough for snacks.  <br>  <br>  Clothing, Spring clothing...you'll want a light jacket or a sweatshirt, and shirtsleeves, probably, for the rest of the time.  Madrid and Segovia will be cool in the mornings, it warms up pretty nicely, though, most days.  <br>  <br>  souvenirs, well, that's up to you.  Think about what you spent on souvenirs the last time you went on vacation. <br>  <br>  I caution you to buy REAL Spanish souvenirs...it is difficult to be sure, but sooooooooooooooo much is just made in China, now, just like what you find here.  Sucks, but it's true!|`|kMK9E2a7aa	March weather is difficult to forecast. It can be anything from cold to quite warm. Every March is different. The last two have been very inclement. If you do get nice weather it will be very pleasant, but if you are wondering what clothes to bring, then you should be asking this question about 4 days before you travel.<br>  As for money, you should be okay with 50€ per day, but remember this, people on holiday often drop their standards and overspend, so bearing that in mind, it's up to you.|`|d3dFw1Gxaa	I was in Madrid, Spain last year for my Spring break. We had a great time but taxis are a bit pricey. I would take no less than $1500. There is a lot to do there and they live for bar hopping. Also remember the exchange rate when you are dealing with money out there. The dollar doesnt mean too much anymore. I would say $1500-2000 just to be safe. There is a lot to buy so make sure you have room to bring back stuff. Make sure you take good walking shoes, warm clothes and an umbrella. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE SOOOOO MUCH FUN. I've been to a few places in Europe but Spain will always be my fav. Have fun and enjoy their pork. LOL.

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of “must sees”. Visit as many as you have time for.:<br>  <br>  Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors can’t be wrong. #1 Destination. <br>  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour. #2 Destination.<br>  Even if you don’t visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And they’re free to visit. <br>  <br>  Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theatre and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street, where Disney shows their movies. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors. <br>  <br>  Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.<br>  <br>  Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies. (The Sting and "Three's Company" come immediately to mind). After visiting the pier, you can ride a bike south a couple miles to Venice Beach.<br>  <br>  Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings. Just north of Santa Monica Pier.<br>  <br>  Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.<br>  <br>  Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.<br>  <br>  TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go. <br>  <br>  Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.<br>  <br>  Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.<br>  <br>  Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.<br>  <br>  Places to eat:<br>  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.<br>  Pink’s Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.<br>  Tommy’s Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.<br>  Canter’s Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.<br>  Phillippe’s: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, it’s hot.<br>  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.<br>  <br>  Places to Stay:<br>  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.<br>  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame. <br>  In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.<br>  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn. <br>  <br>  Places to Shop:<br>  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica<br>  The Grove, Los Angeles<br>  Americana @ Brand, Glendale<br>  Beverly Center, Los Angeles<br>  Citadel Outlets, Commerce<br>  Brea Mall, Brea<br>  The Block at Orange, Orange<br>  South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa<br>  Fashion Island, Newport Beach<br>  Santee Alley, Los Angeles|`|P5rfNdFEaa	If you want to avoid obvious tourist places, then you can try CityWalk.  Here is their website <a href="http://www.citywalkhollywood.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.citywalkhollywood.com/</a>|`|VCzsfVM5aa	sight see, eat, drink, club, museums, shop, you name it you can find it.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	By the way Hollywood is in the Los Angeles district (about northwest of Downtown Los Angeles if you want to get technical).<br>  <br>  -Hollywood Boulevard: This is where you'll find the Walk of Fame (sidewalk stars) and Mann's Chinese Theater (stars' hand- and footprints), as well as the Hollywood and Highland shopping complex, the Kodak Theater and lots of fun Hollywood kitsch. Allow two to four hours to see it all, and while it's the one don't-miss attraction in Hollywood, go there last and stay into the early evening if you can.<br>  <br>  -Take a Real Studio Tour: If you're looking for a theme park with thrill rides, go to Universal Studios, but if you want an authentic, behind-the-scenes tour that shows you how movies are made, take a tour at one of the other studios instead. The tours take about two hours and studios are closed on the weekend, so this is a weekday activity only.<br>  <br>  -Farmers Market: It's not quite in Hollywood proper, but the Farmers Market is close by and a great place to get an inexpensive meal. Some say it's also one of the best places in Los Angeles to spot a celebrity. Early risers can start their day by eating breakfast here.<br>  <br>  -See the Sign: You can see the Hollywood Sign from many places around town, but a quick drive up Mulholland Drive or above the Hollywood Reservoir will reward you with a glimpse of living in the Hollywood Hills and get some great city views, too. Allow about an hour for the round trip drive.<br>  <br>  -Hollywood Bowl: This summer concert series is one of the best outdoor music experiences anywhere. This is an after-dark activity.<br>  <br>  -Sunset Strip: This section of Sunset Boulevard has a big reputation, but there's not that much to see, unless you want to go to the clubs at night.<br>  <br>  -Stars' Home Tour: Few of today's stars actually live in Hollywood, and much of what the guides tell you is made up or just plain wrong. There are better ways to spend your time.<br>  <br>  -Forest Lawn or Hollywood Forever Cemetery: Unless you're a fan of old Hollywood and want to pay tribute to the stars of yesteryear, these places won't hold much interest for you.<br>  <br>  -Universal Studios: It would take you a whole day just for Universal, and while it's a fun theme park, its studio tour is cursory and scripted.

h2bxL6Xoaa	I don't believe I understand your question. Are you asking about the way he acted and how that showed from the actions at The Alamo? If so, let me tell you two things if you didn't know this<br>  <br>  1. He did not fight at the Alamo<br>  2. Saying that, he did make decisions that would ultimately lead to the not so good outcome of the Battle of the Alamo.<br>  <br>  Sam Houston had been sent letters by William B. Travis, the commander at the Alamo, to send reinforcements. He sent James Fannin, who was stationed at Goliad to reinforce the troops at the Alamo, although he would not make it, and they were caught by the Mexican army. I would say if anything, Sam Houston was a brave, yet stubborn man by not sending his own troops to the Alamo. This would be important down the road when the Texians finally won at The Battle of San Jacinto. He was a pretty cool guy.|`|4U7327Mzaa	Houston was not at the Alamo.  He fought at the Battle of San Jacinto--the shortest decisive battle in modern world history.  <br>  <br>  He had been both US Congressman and Governor for Tennessee, so he had that experience.  He had good working relations with the Native Americans.  He was a Jacksonian Democrat which helped when Texas joined the union.  He served Texas as President, US Senator and Governor.  <br>  <br>  He had some problems with alcohol, but his wife Margaret made him toe the mark and put a limit to his drinking.  That said, he made some very sound decisions which helped Texas.<br>  <br>  His personality traits which helped him were loyalty, tenacity, honor, determination.  All of these helped Houston, Texas and the United States.<br>  <br>  Sam Houston was a great man.|`|bb78255d5b2fd694bb90a42bfb5eded1aa	omg did u not pass your history class lol , go to San Anatonio and see the ALAMO , i go there at least 4 times a year

00adb1891c084d23c41b0c58f3b18359aa	Conquest is a nice ship.<br>  <br>  The itinerary is tiring...2 days out to sea and then 3 ports back to back.<br>  <br>  @ 110 tons, the Conquest gives a very smooth ride.  Her rooms are nice.  We like the Verandah deck with a balcony cabin.  It is really cool to watch the ship turn around in the narrow ship channel the morning you return...(only for very early birds).<br>  <br>  Most of the shows are good and many of the musical acts around the ship are excellent.<br>  <br>  We like the Asian Cafe and Sur Mur for a little different food options.  The Sur Mur is on the upper level of the Cezanne buffet dining room.  Tip...if the lower level does not have any open tables, go up stairs. There are plenty of tables on the upper level. My teen eats the pizza for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  <br>  <br>  Don't miss the Warm Chocolate Melting Cake in the dining room. It is excellent.<br>  <br>  Don't go off on your own in Jamaica..take a cruise sponosored shore excursion.  <br>  <br>  Use Lighthouse Parking instead of the cruise terminal parking..you can save a few bucks and your party does not have to split up while the driver is parking the car.  <a href="http://www.lighthouseparking.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.lighthouseparking.org</a><br>  <br>  Use a cash account if you want to stay within a budget.  It is easy to overspend and get a huge credit card bill at the end of the cruise.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Go to carnival.com. It will give you information of ship.

tDU347knaa	I heard that quite often right before I went to Mexico, too. Such things are usually said by fearful people who have never visited another country.<br>  I didn't have any problems and felt quite safe.|`|HvyE4qpYaa	For a question to have 10+ answers...  I usually leave it alone, as i assume someone has already given a sufficient answer... but alas this is not the case here.<br>  <br>  Mexico is caught in a serious civil conflict... some pundits even call it a civil war?  Why? Because of American drug addictions.  If the market for selling drugs to Americans wasnt so lucrative there wouldnt be all this commotion.  So what exactly is happening?  South American and Caribbean presidents have succesfully cracked down on trafficking these past 5 years and this has pushed the trafficking to Mexico's northern border.  The last yrs of the last president in office saw a significant increase in drug related violence... so much so that President Calderon made it a top priority to erradicate drug barons, cartels and mafiasd all together.<br>  <br>  What this has caused?  A bitter conflict betweeen each of the mafias in Mexico, as well as brutal slayings of soldiers and law enforcement officers.  As a result, the police in many Mexican cities are overwhelmed, and simple robberies and domestic violence issues, etc... are not on theitr priority list... what has this caused?  Criminals in Mexico to act with complete and total impunity...<br>  Crime this past year in Mexico has reached a new high. <br>  <br>  If you're going for work, more than likely your company will put you up in a secure hotel, and the company's office probably has security themselves.  It's not 100% safe, but don't fear for your life.  Mexico's murder rate last year is one of the highest in the peaceful world, but the majority of these slayings were either police officers or people involved in the drug trade.  Crossing into Ciudad Acuna (Across the river from Del RIO) isnt going to be too scary.  It's a small town where many a west texas hillbillies love to party after a weekend fishin at Amistad reservoir.   Acuna is a sh**ty little town though... but you'll be safe.<br>  <br>  Remember, people who have bad expreriences will always speak up... those with good experience generally don't say anything.  GOod luck... and enjoy Mexico.  It really is great.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	The Mexican drug gangs are brazen, not afraid of anyone.  They'll go after police and judges and don't care that innocent people get hit by stray bullets.

Not to be racist or anything, there are allot of noncriminal people there but its just dangerous|`|9c5iR4qoaa	Yes<br>  They're kidnapping and/or murdering tourists coming into mexico, especially people driving there.<br>  <br>  For example I don't remember how long ago it was...about 2 months ago I think...a lady who works with my dad drove into mexico to visit her mother-in-law....she was with her husband and her 13 year old daughter.<br>  <br>  They were pulled over, kidnapped, and held hostage. They had to get family from over here in Texas to drive down and pay $1500 ransom.<br>  <br>  Then they gave them their car back and let em go....all their luggage and stuff had been ransacked though.<br>  <br>  As insane as this sounds, it's 100% true.<br>  I am SO glad they finally put out a travel advisory 2 days ago.|`|wlmdOxAuaa	Don't trust rumors.

Ghjaezi5aa	Personally I don't think lying about smoking is such a big deal. It doesn't mean that he's gonna lie about more serious stuff in the future. When he said that he lied cause he didn't want to discourage you, that might be true but another possibility is that he was afraid of your reaction if he had told you the truth - maybe you were being too repressive and he didn't want to hear you complaining about how he failed? Or maybe he just did not want to argue upon this when he had more serious problems about money and family... I would consider this a white lie, don't we all tell little white lies every now and then? Sometimes we have issues that we just don't want to share. I wouldn't call him a liar if he respects you, being faithful to you and fulfilling his responsibilities in the relationship. <br>  <br>  If you feel like ending this relationship, you should consider the effect of other factors - maybe you are tired of a long-distance relationship? Maybe somehow you don't love him as much as you did before. When I was madly in love, my boyfriend lied about something much more serious than smoking, and believe me I just could not walk away. Not because I was weak but because I thought what happened was not worth throwing away what we had. So if you are pushed away so easily because of such a lie, then I suggest you re-consider your feelings for him.|`|83ba6c11f684a2ba5bbc25e6e6e92077aa	First you need to make sure that the issue is really about him lying, like you said. I m personnaly not convinced about that yet (I am not saying you are lying about this, but you might be not aware), and I guess I am entitled to my opinion as you are asking this question here on a Y!A section (actually two sections, I guess).  As the sinless person, you threw the stone, oops you weren't sinless either.<br>  <br>  "He told me he was so sorry but it was so hard for him and he didnt wanna tell me in case I get discouraged in quitting. He was also hoping by lying it spur him to quit soon as he wldnt wanna keep on lying."<br>  <br>  "He has been in depression coz of the economic crisis there and he has not been paid for 2-3 months by his company. His dad has been calling him useless and he hints to me life seems meaningless to him."<br>  <br>  He should have given up on quitting smoking together with you without a professional help. The body of a long time smoker needs nicotine. Even if you could (apparently you couldn't either) he might be not able to go cold turkey, even if he thought so at the beginning. Very few people can. <br>  <br>  This nameless ex has many reasons to be depressed and add to that a girlfriend who left him. Now he probably has noone to support him, not a parent, not a girlfriend, who were together with him in the good times. It should be harder than having some problem with some local. <br>  <br>  I seem to have taken the side of the thief as in that Nasreddin Hoca tale. Does the thief have no guilt? He sure is guilty as well. Has he taken the best path? No. He probably thought this was a white lie, and better of the several evils. Differences in priorities, and not being aware of this difference might be the issue here. <br>  <br>  I do not know who proposed quitting smoking together, but I commend the one who agreed to this proposal, even if this might have turned out to be a mistake.|`|G5BQbs3Gaa	I don't think you should be mad at him for lying to you about smoking because sooo many people smoke in Turkey that it is like a social avtivity . And think about it this way, he lied to you that he quit because he doesn't want you to be disappointed in him. And it really isn't that easy to quit. Also, I think you should be extra supportive since he is going through hard times. Leaving him during this hard time for him will make it worse. And I would also like to add that EVERYONE lies. Some people lie black lies and some are white(beyaz yalan), my mom uses white lies a lot for my own good. See, sometimes people lie not to make some one else miserable but because they don't want to hurt that person. I think he pulled a white lie and deserves to be forgiven. If he wants to quit smoking he needs to want it himself.|`|LX7GBNbqaa	If he is good in every other way except for his smoking, why would you want to end a three year relationship over something so little? I understand smoking is a big deal for you, but perhaps it is a lot harder for him to quit than it was for you. Maybe he should get a nicotine patch, or in the United States, there is a prescription drug called Chantix that can help you quit smoking. <br>  <br>  You are the only one who can decide if you made the right decision, so if his lying about smoking hurt you that badly, then you are probably better off without him.

With the closings of Shoe Pavilion, Linens-N-Things, Mervyns, and Circuit City, it's going to be EVEN MORE difficult.<br>  <br>  You will also need about $10,000 to start off.<br>  <br>  Decent prices start at $1000 mo. for either an extremely small studio or a 1bd/1ba apartment if you're lucky. There is no such thing as $550 mo. here. A minimum waged job alone will barely pay the rent. Remember, you need to eat, you need water, gas, electric, personal hygiene, etc.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	OK, LA itself is 500 squre miles, so "10 miles from LA" is hard to define.<br>  <br>  For that much, you might be able to rent a room, but not an apartment.<br>  <br>  We see this every day in this forum: Everyone wants to move here, and is looking for “cheap/affordable and safe". However, such a place just doesn’t exist; the two terms are mutually exclusive. It's all about supply and demand: If it's in SoCal, then it's not going to be cheap to begin with. If it's a safe area, then it's more expensive. If you need good schools, add a couple hundred bucks a month on top of it.<br>  <br>  If you want to live here and enjoy the weather, then you have to pay for it. You put up with the smog and the traffic, enjoy the weather and pay your rent or mortgage. My advice is to start checking out craigslist, rent.com, and apartments.com if you are looking to rent. You’ll quickly see that the minimum rent for a non-war zone is about $1,000-$1,200 per month for a studio or 1BR. Really nice areas (like the West LA area) easily run $3,000 or more. Want to live near the beach? Expect to pay a premium.|`|YfIm4IqSaa	If 10 miles is your limit than I gauarantee you it will be a sh-thole unless you get a roommate.<br>  <br>  The antelope valley is basically the part of LA county where you find prices like that at decent living.

818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	Well, you cannot work in any foreign country without a work visa.  The only way to get a work visa is to have a much needed skill and find an employer to sponsor you...that is not going to happen for a short term job.  The U.S. is a huge country, so you could  go to an area you have not been to before, or one of the territories.   If work is really important, you may have to put the job first and location second...since jobs are going to be difficult to find.
AA12095483	It's the mouse and elephant routine. Anything the US does has an effect on Canada - positive or negative.

7oA361fbaa	3-4 days isn't a lot of time and you don't want to eat up too much of that time travelling to the next country - especially if your departure flight to get back home is going from England and even more time would have to be spent travelling back there.<br>  <br>  To maximise your time, I would probably suggest Wales as this is the quickest to get to from England (assuming you are visiting the South of England) however I have never been here so I can't recommend attractions.<br>  <br>  If travelling is not an issue as you can afford flights to the next country then I would recommend Ireland as it is a considerably different culture than in Britain.<br>  <br>  I would suggest flying into Cork.<br>  Here are a list of a few attractions in Cork and Kerry:<br>  <a href="http://www.cork-guide.ie/attracts.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cork-guide.ie/attracts.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.countykerry.com/kerry_environment_ring.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.countykerry.com/kerry_environ...</a>|`|tGGVeW3yaa	Well I've been to Wales and I live in Ireland so I don't know anything about Scotland so i'm not going to mention it. Wales and Ireland are a lot the same, we have the same climate, so no matter were you go theres going to be a lot of rain. Ireland has a lot of castle shops and you can always visit the Aran Islands on a day trip, on the boat over you can watch the dolphins jump in and out of the waves after the boat, and Wales is exactly the same theres a lot of castles, shops and so on, in both they have a lot of historical sites. So at the end of the day it really doesn't matter which you choose you'll have the same holiday. <br>  But just because i'm Irish I have to say Ireland is better :-)
XBulMn2zaa	You will get the best rate by booking now.  If the price goes down, you will get the lower rate if you get a good agent to keep track or you can watch yourself and call.  I am more concerned about your surgery a month before sailing.  What if there are complications, or it needs to be reschedule, etc.?

Taxes were not included.  If your cabin accomodations are for a balcony or suite your current price of $1000. p/p is not out of line especially if it includes taxes.<br>  <br>  Often times we arrange our own air through the travel agent and it is usually less cost.  We usually also fly down to FL a day early, especially in winter, to insure that we won't miss the ship.  That does add about $150 for a hotel however.  Even so it is often cheaper, especially if you get an internet special at Southwest when it first becomes available.<br>  <br>  If you are planning to buy trip insurance you can usually get that from the travel agency at a lower cost than that charged by the cruise line.  However if you use the cruise line air package it's probably best to buy their insurance as well.  Then if there's a problem with the air portion of the package there'll be less problems.<br>  <br>  Finally if you haven't travelled much and don't have a travel agent you know well, I suggest you ask friends, family or co-workers who are experienced travellers to recommend one to you.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.

NK3VJgiRaa	I think they are both nice. But I'd say Puerto Rico is definitely the vacation for your husband if you want to do alot of sightseeing & stay busy. San Juan is a fairly big & busy city. There is always something to do there. Old San Juan is full of historical sites like El Morro Fortress. There are restaurants, casinos, nightlife, shopping & beaches all in close distance. The Bacardi Factory & the Don Q factory give tours with free drink samples. Also there is alot to see outside of San Juan. El Yunque Rain forest is good with easy trails to walk & waterfalls to swim in. Camuy caves & Arecibo telescope are nice too.

If you are into culture, history, theatre etc, it's not so crash hot.<br>  <br>  At one time, all there was consisted of a large army base, a smaller RAAF base, a university, the copperworks, and the city centre.

If you wait until June, 2009, then you WILL need a passport after that to go anywhere or to come back into the U.S. and THAT INCLUDES MEXICO, Puerto Rico and the U.S.V.I.  Right now you need a passport to return to the U.S by plane or boat from anywhere else.<br>  <br>  I honestly don't understand this stupidity about having a Passport that AmeriKans express.  WHY do they think they should be allowed to enter foreign countries with nothing more than their stupid voter's registration card or an old utility bill for ID?  Just how ARROGANT can a person be?  It is long past time when AmeriKans need to get passports LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD
tC2T7poCaa	no, i dont think that is expensive, people buy bucket loads of tics in advance and then sell for a massive profit when sold out, but if u wanna go then yeah i would pay it, as for standing it is alot better than sitting, i stand all the time, when sitting you can just sit and watch but standing is like a massive dance floor and you just boogie away, generally u would go with another, but when u r standing u r having too much of a good time that u dont speak to ure mate till its finished anyway, so all is cool|`|lgXSmCQRaa	Erm generally people go with other people but because it will be crowded you could get away with it.

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of “must sees”. Visit as many as you have time for.:<br>  <br>  Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors can’t be wrong. #1 Destination. <br>  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour. #2 Destination.<br>  Even if you don’t visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And they’re free to visit. <br>  <br>  Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theatre and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street, where Disney shows their movies. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors. <br>  <br>  Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.<br>  <br>  Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies. (The Sting and "Three's Company" come immediately to mind). After visiting the pier, you can ride a bike south a couple miles to Venice Beach.<br>  <br>  Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings. Just north of Santa Monica Pier.<br>  <br>  Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.<br>  <br>  Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.<br>  <br>  TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go. <br>  <br>  Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.<br>  <br>  Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.<br>  <br>  Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.<br>  <br>  Places to eat:<br>  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.<br>  Pink’s Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.<br>  Tommy’s Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.<br>  Canter’s Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.<br>  Phillippe’s: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, it’s hot.<br>  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.<br>  <br>  Places to Stay:<br>  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.<br>  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame. <br>  In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.<br>  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn. <br>  <br>  Places to Shop:<br>  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica<br>  The Grove, Los Angeles<br>  Americana @ Brand, Glendale<br>  Beverly Center, Los Angeles<br>  Citadel Outlets, Commerce<br>  Brea Mall, Brea<br>  The Block at Orange, Orange<br>  South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa<br>  Fashion Island, Newport Beach<br>  Santee Alley, Los Angeles|`|aY9v3SJKaa	Disneyland and Hollywood Blvd. Also Universal Studios.|`|3734b5f7e7c27b91d0268c00d9e7ed41aa	While I agree with most of 'obviousism's response....<br>  he does leave out the greater LA region.<br>  If you were to, say, take a chance, and reach beyond the County of LA, and perhaps head down to the OC (Orange County), you might find some great stuff, by the beach, in Dana Point, and San Clemente.<br>  at Dana Point, you can see the surf break made famous by the Beach Boys song, a long right break!<br>  Get Breakfast at the Harbor House Cafe....visit Doheny, then head down to San Clemente, where you can walk the pier, and see the excellent surfers at "T" Street, then get some great pizza at Sonny's, (possibly one of the top ten Italian places in So. Cal.)<br>  On your way out? You can peruse the art galleries in Laguna, and then head on up the 405, to the 110 FWY, to the Alpine Village.<br>  OR? After your foray into the OC, you would find a perfectly wonderful evening visiting King Harbour, in Redondo?<br>  <br>  Any way?<br>  Look these places up, or email me.<br>  I have lived in the region my entire life, and I love sharing with visitors and newcomers, the best places to visit, for the least amount of money.<br>  For instance, if you want a big breakfast for a good value?<br>  Try "The Original Pantry", downtown.<br>  Best breakfast, for the dollar anywhere!|`|WsFbhxZyaa	beach, and Disneyland, owntown Disney.

B3FBgxjEaa	I found Hippos<br>  We will transfer by small plane north to Bahar Dar, the flight taking just one hour. This northern town is situated at 5,700 feet on the southern shores of Lake Tana, the largest upland lake in Africa and the source of the Blue Nile. Beginning here, and meeting the White Nile in Khartoum, this great river makes a 3,500-mile journey to the Mediterranean. We will be transferred to the Tana Hotel, beautifully positioned at the edge of the Lake, for a 2-night stay. Around the Lake and on its islands are medieval monasteries, built here by the Coptic Church in order toescape oppression. In the afternoon a boat trip on the lake is included with a visit to Ura Kidane Meheret Church.By the lakeshore, large papyrus beds supply the local boat-builders with material for their Raft-like craft in a methodof construction used for thousands of years. The point where the Blue Nile leaves the Lake, a veritable oasis forwaterbirds; you may then watch the sun set over the River and the Lake from a nearby viewpoint. Evening is agood time to watch for Hippos as they leave their watery daytime refuges to graze in nearby meadows.<br>  <a href="http://209.85.129.132/search?q=cache:AeuFqKO3IiUJ:www.naturetrek.co.uk/dossiers/The%2520Best%2520of%2520Ethiopia%2520-%2520itinerary.pdf+Hippopotamuses+attacks+in+Lake+Tana%3F&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=7" rel="nofollow">http://209.85.129.132/search?q=cache:Aeu...</a><br>  <br>  From a 1935 book<br>  A few hippopotami are left in lake Tana, but crocodiles, which are numerous in the Blue Nile, are absent and have not been known to pass the lake outlet. ...<br>  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1785868" rel="nofollow">http://www.jstor.org/pss/1785868</a>
eD7qRBKHaa	They haven't said, really.  It is known they are doing some repairs to the track.  It is suspected that they will add music and updates to lights and everything like they did in California, but they have not confirmed that.|`|wVzm8Ir7aa	You can forget the Disneyland version. They're replacing some track but not changing the layout. The queue is being covered so the lights don't interfere with the attraction, they're doing some ceiling work and there may be a few additional changes.<br>  <br>  It's currently scheduled to be closed 4/19 through 11/21|`|pWtRasf6aa	I've heard that they are going to referb to look similar to the one in Disneyland, and the main sort of difference will be that the cars will be different. Apparently they want to fit more people through the ride, which isn't a bad idea at all. So to accommodate, they're supposed to make the seats for two people, instead of just one.|`|siBUbTdyaa	Nothing much really. The track layout will be the same, but I believe they are replacing the track, painting & doing some other stuff.
8ivnzNi5aa	You could get off of I-5 just before you get into Oregon and see the site of the Mt.St. Helens eruption.  I also recall a place in California, off of US 101, where long ago somebody cut a road tunnel THROUGH a redwood tree to demonstrate how big the tree was.  I can't remember precisely where it was, but I think there will be signs advertising it.  Of course, I haven't been out that way since 1982, so there may be a lot more stuff that I don't know about.

Ao52XHjCaa	Art dealing is more about connections with buyers than foot traffic, so whatever you decide to do, networking will be key. If you already have a degree in art history, you might opt to take the intensive course at NYU-scripps for appraisal and their courses in running a gallery. (Continuing education). I've thought about opening a gallery or working in one myself, and I figured I'd start at NYU. I went to the New School, but I never took courses at Parsons, so I don't know that program very well.<br>  <br>  Now, as someone who lives in New York but is not rich, what we still lack here is someone regularly bringing in the artists from the west coast - namely the Juxtapoz type artists - early. (at least that's my opinion). If you're off to sign artists for east coast representation, I think LA and SF are still hotter than NY, and what goes on in East Asia is still more interesting than Europe and outsider is better than stuff produced out of MFA programs....but that is all highly subjective. (I'm not rich. I just go to galleries to look at the new. I'll come to your opening night, but I'm not your target customer to say the least).<br>  <br>  Good luck. (Please tell me how much you make if you go for it. I hope to follow you some day.)|`|2uINYiMfaa	allot of the best art dealers never even went to college.

0ZfZulnzaa	Not usually, if you look at the fine print it will tell you if they can be used in Canada, but normally they are to be used only in the US. I know the coupons we get here say they are only valid in Canada.|`|K4zovvVhaa	Not very likely. Printable coupons are used to drive traffic to certain stores, so it would not be recommended to issue them internationally. We have this question a lot about House of Fraser (printable vouchers) and Littlewoods (online codes) between Ireland and UK, as the same brand is present in both countries. Maybe you can find a website like <a href="http://www.dtcdeals.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dtcdeals.com</a> that offers screneed deals and coupons for your region.|`|BpxDSiOHaa	Most coupons are limited to the country they are printed out for.

Why force the dude to pay huge bucks for a hotel?<br>  <br>  There's more to this story, I just know it!

If you love roller coasters then definitely go to Islands of Adventure!|`|BEJmgPKvaa	myrtle beach<br>  miami<br>  ocean city<br>  or go somewhere tropical i know its not on the east coast but its so nice|`|AA11739944	Savannah, GA. That's what I'd do with that much money. I wish my parents were rich and spoiled me with money. I didn't have a 16th birthday party. In fact, i haven't had one in 7 years.|`|1c470b9b05642cf51268da4e601ed2ecaa	maybe florida or maine or something. look up cool vacations on the internet it will give you ideas. and i have divorced parents too don't worry. i know how you feel|`|ewV1gSQnaa	Panama City Beach Florida <br>  Myrtle Beach South Carolina|`|5a328dcc94efb65565b23591fae9787caa	Well first of all, not many kids get $1000 and in your case $2500 birthday gifts from their parents, especially with the economy being the way it is today, so consider yourself very fortunate and not put to much emphasis on where you go, but certainly be grateful that you have the money to go anywhere.<br>  <br>  Being 16 there definitely needs to be an adult or two present.  A cruise would be nice and you visit different a few islands too.  Maybe a long weekend cruise to the Bahamas.  Myrtle Beach is also a nice beach destination or Miami.<br>  <br>  Either way have a good time and remember your parents divorced each other, not you, if you are loved by both, money can't buy that, just be grateful to them both.|`|rz88Flzzaa	if you're staying on the east coast, go to myrtle beach, sc. it's a beautiful resort town that has a lot to offer. you'll have a lot of fun with your friends and there are a few under 21 clubs that you can enjoy. the bayview resort is a nice place to stay.
AA11496012	Out of the airlines listed, I would pick JetBlue.  They do not overbook passengers and they have satellite TV on their flights.  <br>  <br>  Southwest is not bad and they fly to more destinations since it is a larger airline.<br>  <br>  Virgin America isn't bad either but they are limited in where they fly.|`|fZjgIE9Baa	US Airways. #1 on time airline in 2008, and I love flying with them.

Pr3QIlweaa	(First answer!  Wahoo!!)<br>  <br>  Here's Tripadvisor's list of Toronto hotels as ranked by users:<br>  <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g155019-Toronto_Ontario-Hotels.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g15501...</a><br>  <br>  Keep in mind that this list is based on the number of positive reviews, and not price or hotel class, etc.  You can sort the hotels by (average) price, class and more (using the links provided), if you want, though.<br>  <br>  However, "positive" reviews can be very misleading.  For instance, while I like that site for researching hotels, it is painfully obvious that one person's "great" hotel can be another person's nightmare.  You have to consider hotel class, and price, along with location, to find basically what you're looking for.  Then consider the reviews, after that.<br>  <br>  You can search around for hotels near a specific attraction, and then see which ones patrons have liked best, if you're most interested in a hotel near a specific place.<br>  <br>  Happy hunting!  :-)|`|XfjAwH7Haa	Please take my advice and use hotwire.com , you can get  a great rate on a good hotel.

When a special price is offered, there is sometimes a promotional code you need to enter to obtain that fare and is good only for that particular flight or flights. If you're looking for a promotional code for a normal everyday fare, there most likely isn't one.|`|AA11496012	See if <a href="http://www.farecompare.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.farecompare.com</a> has anything.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Try looking on Flyertalk.

However, it is NOT a 30 minute ride into Manhattan.  There's one "express" train that goes from AC to NYC and it takes nearly 3 hours.|`|AA12086491	I have only rented a condo in Delaware but as far as access to the city, I would recommend CT.  Guilford is a nice little town, CT has many of them and also has beaches.  Nicer beaches are farther from the city.  Check out Amtrak to see where you would need to pick up a train and what time you would need to catch it to spend enough time in NYC. Personally I would split it up.  Go to a good beach area first and rent your condo, then go visit NYC for a day or two, just focusing on that to avoid the commute.  There are many things to see in NYC but they are not really close together so you need to plan well. If you do really want to split your time however, try something on Long Island, there are many beaches there on the south side where you can have fun.|`|fFnsJ7maaa	Don't try CT, the beaches aren't really on the ocean. They're on Long Island Sound, a bathtub. No waves, warmer than the ocean, low tide is a very long way from high tide.

8vGq6cRTaa	We don't know how meet and greets are working. Some hit radio stations near venues are having contests for meet and greet passes so I don't know how else you can get passes.  You can try getting there at 5 and see if you can get a pass to the meet and greet somehow. Until a few of these concerts have happened we don't know what kind of signing opportunities they will have.<br>  <br>  EDIT - forget that. Apparently some people start lining up at 3PM or earlier. If yours is a standing only venue, and you are not near the front of the line, you may not be able to see. I could not see David for my whole concert. (wah)

G2h8g2g1aa	The sad fact is, the House of Blues is once of the best small music venues in Chicago.  I would say after that Park West: <a href="http://wwww.parkwestchicago.com/" rel="nofollow">http://wwww.parkwestchicago.com/</a> which was recently remodeled, is also a good venue, followed by Reggie's: <a href="http://www.reggieslive.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.reggieslive.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  The sad thing is Chicago has a lot of classic venues like The Aragon Ballroom, The Riviera and The Congress that are old beautiful...but the harmonics are just awful.  It's gotten so bad that I've driven out to Indianapolis to see shows that I could have seen at The Congress in Chicago.  The music venues in Indy are newer and built with better technology so that the walls absorb the sound instead of having it bounce all over the place.<br>  <br>  I'm not suggesting you drive out to Indy for a show like I do, I'm just saying I've seen rap, rock & country shows at all of the venues mentioned, and I really try to avoid the older venues because it's always disappointing.

gm9QYLjIaa	First of all every one of your options are going to be safe relatively some may require more work but there is absolutely nothing dangerous on route between the two countries. <br>  <br>  There are direct flights from Istanbul to Thessaloniki, I can assume Volos is close to Thessaloniki so you'd either be able to catch a bus or the train from there. You may need to get in contact with the airlines themselves to know more about the cost and the date they operate. The most regular flights are provided by Turkish Airlines by they are not cheap at all, bear that in mind, this is the easiest method but very pricey. Otherwise there is Aegean airlines and Olympic that operate between the two cities. Some other airlines might offer trips but they're probably going to charter, meaning you may not be able to control the dates and exact time. For flights I can estimate a price between 200-500 euros<br>  <br>  Otherwise you may choose to take the train, it's a long trip but people have said it was very comfortable. There's a railway route between Istanbul and Thessaloniki, but I don't know if it continues to Volos, you may need to check that out with the Greece railway company. Otherwise you have bus options, I now varan (www.varan.com) and ulusoy (www.ulusoy.com) make trips to Thessaloniki and Athens. This is cheap and their seats are very comfortable though I've heard it takes longer to cross the border with the bus. But I guess it's still quicker compared to the train. They could be as low as 20 euros for the train if you choose pullman and buy it in Turkey, I guess around 60 euros for the bus. <br>  <br>  I found this: <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/thread.jspa?threadID=506047" rel="nofollow">http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/th...</a> but these are old posts so I doubt you may be able to get more information, my advice is to ask tourism agencies in Istanbul (ask your hotel to point you towards one). They may be able to give you more informations about ferries and flights. Ferries are not always cheap though, be sure to check the flights cause they may amount to the same price in the end and be a lot less inconvenient. Anyway I know there are a lot of costal ferries between Turkey and the Greeks islands but you will need to make 3 to 4 trips and it will not be cheap, for example you'll need to take the bus (15 euros) from Istanbul to Ayvalik (or Canakkale, I'm not sure), then take the ferry to go Lesbos (30-50 euros) and again look for a ferry from there to either Volos or Thessaloniki (again usually between 20-50 euros). <br>  <br>  I hope this helps, but honestly check with a travel agency in Istanbul or call your hotel and ask them for advice they may be able to point you towards the best options. Good luck!

AZgIkmfxaa	I live in Santiago de Chile, and the southern part of Chile ranges from a temperate rainforest to a cold weather desert.<br>  <br>  The area around Osorno is in the temperate rainforest part. It rains a lot in this area (3,000 mm/annum) as opposed to Santiago which receives only 300 mm/annum. So bring rain gear. The weather is typically cooler because of effects of the south-east Pacific Ocean and it's southerly location. Make sure you have warm sweaters. The temperature rarely goes below freezing, but it can be cool and damp.  Summers (December-February) are more sunny and warmer (18oC-30oC).|`|x1CcZBENaa	I've done some research.It is  between 2°C and 3°C (3.6°F and 5.4°F)

dUpVqoB6aa	Generally my experience regarding ABC learning centres is not a positive one.However,regardless of where you enrol your child some of the important things to consider.<br>  <br>  1. When you visit observe whether the other children are happy and engaged with play?<br>  <br>  2. Does the stuff engage with the child during play time?<br>  <br>  3. Is the centre clean?<br>  <br>  4. What sort of program do they have and what sort of polices are there in place?<br>  <br>  5. Observe the staff -are they happy or do they appear as if they have to be there.<br>  <br>  6.Check out the resources that the centre has -have they got resources for outside and inside? Are these resources safe?<br>  <br>  Go by your gut feeling when you are there.If you feel that the place is positive and that your child would be happy and safe there then that is positive.Make sure that you visit during different times to check out how they handle different routines (sleep times,eating,play time).Staff qualification and experience is also important.<br>  <br>  It also depends on what your philosophies are about early childhood.Does the centre match your views?<br>  <br>  I have been to 3 ABC centres as a prac student and all of these had a negative vibe.Often I felt like crying when I saw how the children were treated.<br>  <br>  I also did some practicums in C&K centres and these were always positive experiences.<br>  <br>  So,expolore a number of different centres before you make the decision.|`|uAyYRXnvaa	The questions don't really matter.  The demeanour of the staff will tell you everything you need to know.  I put my kids in an ABC for a little while, while I was waiting to get them into another place and the staff were obviously minimum wage, only doing this because I have to, type people.  You'll know as soon as you walk through the door whether your girl should go there or not.

As far as the main areas of tourist interest, Metro connects downtown, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Koreatown, the airport, and Hollywood.  You can get to most of the major sights.  It doesn't go to Beverly Hills or Santa Monica.  On a 2-3 day visit focusing on LA itself, it's possible to use the Metro and not rent a car - on a longer visit or a visit where you go to the surrounding areas and not just to LA proper, you would absolutely need a car.<br>  <br>  For residents, it's not very good.  The Metro routes are not useful to the vast majority of LA commuters.  The buses are slow and get stuck in LA's often terrible traffic, and suburban trains are much more limited than in some cities.|`|aL8ebRMfaa	Any major city that ceases to operate trains and buses after 9 PM is horrible with public transportation.|`|6Gfz125Paa	It's actually better than many people realize.

W55tjTcbaa	It all depends on the hotel.  Some hotels only require you to be 18 and some require you to be atleast 21.  Look up some hotels in Orlando and call them to see how old you will have to be.  Most likely any hotel with a bar, restaurant, or room service is going to require you to be 21.  I would definitely call ahead so you're not searching all over when you arrive.  At my hotel it is up to the owner how old you must be to rent a room.|`|FCCkrhozaa	Yes.

f9No4eRBaa	BC is a large Province and Vancouver Island is larger than many states. There are major variations on the climate, depending where you live. For example right now in Vancouver it's been approx 50F and other parts of the province has been in the low to middle 20'sF. <br>  The Vancouver area and valley is the banana belt of Canada and is always warmer (very similar to Seattle Weather). The interior what we call the Okanagan area is similar to California in the summer. It is hot and desert weather and our Fruit growing area. In the winter this area is cold, below freezing with snow.

For all of the professions you mentioned, they would almost certainly early less than their counterparts in the US or EU.  <br>  <br>  The elite, educated class (for example those with a Masters from Harvard) might actually make more in Turkey.  This is because such professionals are 1. rare 2. have an even higher level of presitgue in Turkey than in the EU and US because foreign universities and foreign professional are often highly regarded.<br>  <br>  Also, if you are lucky enough to be born into a high-profile family in Turkey, you might get "placed" into very high paying jobs.  In the US and EU there is more of an "individualistic" notion, meaning that you have to work your way up to such high-profile positions.  Therefore, you may be born into a wealthy family in the US/EU but never earn a high salary because you personally didn't work hard.  In Turkey, many high-society families will generally place their children in high executive positions regardless of their intellegence level, education or ambition.|`|xtKEToLHaa	I think in Turkey the salaries are lower, but you have free and no limit shishkebab and baklava everyday...So , what do you prefer?|`|km9cQNAXaa	No.<br>  <br>  Salaries in Turkey are much lower.

gfGsXVc3aa	They do have snow globes that are exclusively sold at Disneyland they range in prices from $12.00 to $100.00 plus, they sell these at several location's in Disneyland especially on Mainstreet like Disneyana and Clothiers china closet . There is one that has the Disneyland Castle inside and the characters all around this is one of my favorites, I believe it is $85.00 or there abouts. They change from time to time but this is one I saw a year ago and again last week when I was there. Also the World of Disney store has a area inside in the middle where they have collectibles and such and they also have some exclusive Snow globes that tend to be more expensive.

QJy1byOmaa	There is some racism against white people from the locals. There is also racism between the different ethnic groups- filipinos hang out with filipinos, Mexicans hang out with Mexicans, etc. As long as you are respectful of the different races and ethnic groups you will be fine. My best friends are from all different backgrounds so there are some exceptions to the rules.|`|YhECDSKRaa	You ask a very interesting question.  I used to live in Boston & there were serious racism problems there.  I have lived in Hawaii for > 30 years.  I won't try to say there is NO racism here, but it is nothing like what I remember from the mainland.  What is different here, is that everybody is a minority.  This definitely changes the dynamics.  Caucasian people feel the sting of racism here, which they often do not on the mainland.  So you will hear from some haoles (Caucasians & this is not a pejorative term in & of itself) how the racism in Hawaii is just terrible.  It is my personal opinion that this is because they tended not to be on the receiving end of it on the mainland, as they were the dominant group.|`|Bv0dPwCDaa	yes, hawaii has their share,,,if you are white, you will be called Haole,,, if you are black, you will have it tougher here!|`|e7mz6lKxaa	If you think America is "so racist" you haven't been much out of the country. <br>  <br>  I lived in Hawaii for 3 years and LOVED it.

However, you do not want to enroll as a university student for a full year, so the student visa is not appropriate for you.  You need to contact the embassy and talk to  them about this and ask what type of visa you should apply for. See site below for contact info.|`|reHRXlZCaa	Everyone requires a passport for international travel - if you're travelling abroad, to Ireland for instance, you need to have a minimum of 3 months left on your passport when you travel.  <br>  <br>  If you were coming to the Republic of Ireland as a tourist, under the visa waiver scheme, you could stay & travel around the country for a minimum of 90 days. <br>  <br>  However, as a student wishing to live & study in the Republic of Ireland you will require a visa.

irFvDZmNaa	Hi!  Yes! Having your immunizations is very important before you go to Kenya. For instance, some immunizations require a few weeks before departure in order to be effective. One example is malaria pills. If you begin taking them 1 day before your trip, they will not be immediately effective. <br>  <br>  Ok! Here is my advice for you. Visit your nearest "travel doctor." He/she will then inform you on exact medicines that are necessary based on where you are traveling. <br>  <br>  I traveled to Ghana a couple summers ago, and I had to go through the same process that you will soon undertake. Have a blast in Kisumu! I plan to travel to Kenya sometime this year, or early 2010. <br>  <br>  OH! One more important point! Immunizations can be very costly. Some immunizations will be highly recommended, while others will be suggested, but not vitally recommended. For the not so important immunizations, ask your travel doctor if it is really necessary to purchase them. I saved hundreds of dollars by only taking the vital medications. This is a personal decision however, because some people want to be 100% safe instead of 99.9999%  : )  So they are willing to spend the extra money.   <br>  <br>  Lastly, be sure to ask your travel doctor about getting the best price for your immunizations. This will save you hundreds of dollars. For instance, my travel doctor gave me 3 choices for malaria immunization. A) One pill a day for two weeks. By company A. $250    B) One time injection for $300. Or C) 1 pill a day for 7-8 weeks. $25. Of course I chose option C.  <br>  <br>  Now, you may then ask if the more expensive immunizations are of better quality, and better protection. My doctor quickly told me that all 3 options are just as effective. The only benefit of choosing choice A or B is that your treatment will be done quicker. After he told me that, I was eager to accept the 25$ option. Then, to make things even better, he said that the 25$ is just average. If I were to call different pharmacies, I could even find rates as low as 16$. Therefore, I called different pharmacies, and found a prescription for malaria pills that were only 19$. I was so happy!  <br>  <br>  Sorry for so many details, but you deserve to know these money-saving strategies for traveling abroad. I am trying to put extra cash in your pockets! : )  <br>  <br>  Some doctors are really busy, so be sure to ask about these things in case they fail to mention them. Therefore, save as much money as you can. This will leave you with tons of more spending money in Kenya!    <br>  <br>  If you have more questions, just email me.|`|RILZcr6Daa	Yes,It depends with the type of immunization.get the money for shots first|`|Mi2w3lvEaa	Preventative shots are a must for getting into Kenya.  Yellow fever and gamma globulin are the most important.  The cholera shot is pretty ineffective -- my travel MD just stamps in my WHO card that I got one but doesn't actually give it.  <br>  <br>  I lived in Kisumu 20 years ago and you should definitely take anti-malarials.  The post above has good advice for looking at the different possibilities and educating yourself -- just make sure you get the right thing as malaria is for life.<br>  <br>  Also be realistic about money -- Kenya is not super cheap.  If your finances are so tight that you are debating a ticket versus medical precautions, you might think about delaying your trip until you can save a bit more. <br>  <br>  Safari salaama.  (Have a great trip)

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	We see this every day in this forum: Everyone wants to move here, and is looking for “cheap/affordable and safe". However, such a place just doesn’t exist; the two terms are mutually exclusive. It's all about supply and demand: If it's in SoCal, then it's not going to be cheap to begin with. If it's a safe area, then it's more expensive. If you need good schools, add a couple hundred bucks a month on top of it.<br>  <br>  If you want to live here and enjoy the weather, then you have to pay for it. You put up with the smog and the traffic, enjoy the weather and pay your rent or mortgage. My advice is to start checking out craigslist, rent.com, and apartments.com if you are looking to rent. You’ll quickly see that the minimum rent for a non-war zone is about $1,000-$1,200 per month for a studio or 1BR. Really nice areas (like the West LA area) easily run $3,000 or more.

There is another Springfield nearby in Delaware County, but I don't know much about that.  Springfield is no NYC in size, but is very close to Philly and has an excellent school district.|`|AA11633246	As with any city, commuting will be a concern, and I think commuting to and from Philly's western suburbs is the absolute worst unless you're doing it at weird hours.  <br>  <br>  If you can handle the property taxes, Moorestown and Haddonfield are two of the nicest parts of South Jersey and are only 30 (tops) and 15 minutes from Philly respectively.  Moorestown has actually been ranked nationally as one of the nicest suburbs in the country, and Haddonfield is always recognized as one of the best school districts in NJ.  Haddon Township surrounding Haddonfield is pretty much nice in every part of it...Haddon Heights, Collingswood ( younger, newer), etc.  <br>  <br>  Gloucester County became the new bedroom community for Philadelphia, and saw an explosion during the housing boom.  That being said, there are some deals out there now--like, $750,000 houses for $450,000.  That may not be your range, but it's a deal to someone none the less.  Again though, beware of the property taxes.<br>  <br>  Delaware is tax free, but um...it's Delaware.  There are a few nice spots, but not enough to justify tax-free in my eyes.

Of course a hotel cannot give a room to a child incapable of looking after themselves, but an under 16 should be fine, if they are not TOO young.<br>  <br>  There is no minimum age in English law specifying when a child can be left alone, only that a child under 16 must not be placed "in danger". So if the child is say, 15, and safe in a hotel, that would be fine.|`|KNpUc7wKaa	If you pay online with credit card nobody will ask how old you are.

Now a side note, if you come there with loads of young friends (I presume you are under 18) who are loud and rumbustious they might react.

HWAp79gUaa	Yes you must go through customs, and you also require a direct airside transit visa to catch your other flight. this costs 540 HK$. Check the uk embassy web site for hong kong.<br>  Sorry Stevie, but you are wrong:<br>  Direct airside transit visa (DATV) nationals <br>  DATV nationals are visa nationals who must have a visa to pass through the UK on their way to another country, even if they are not entering the UK or changing airports. Unless they qualify for exemption from the DATV requirement, they cannot transit without visa (TWOV). (You can get more information about DATV exemptions below.)<br>  How do I apply for a direct airside transit visa (DATV)? <br>  If you want to apply for a DATV you will need to show that you:<br>  <br>  have booked an onward ticket from the UK for travel within 24 hours of your arrival; <br>  will not need to change airport in the UK; <br>  have all the correct documents you will need to be allowed to enter the country you are travelling to; and <br>  will not need to pass through the UK's immigration control. <br>  <br>  Customs is not immigration control. you still have to pass through customs as you are travelling onwards to a third country.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	No. If you are simply on a re-fuel or connection stop, you do not need to go through customs, as you will not need to go through immigration.<br>  <br>  Your baggage, which has been checked in, does not need to be brought passenger-side.

0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	I lived in Sweden for several years.<br>  <br>  The landscape is very pretty, filled with pristine lakes and forests. There are some rolling mountains in more northern/western regions (along the border with Norway), and nice beaches on the western coast south of G?teborg. The countryside is filled with farms and red houses, the cities are very clean and modern.<br>  <br>  The culture isn't that different from most places. Most people do something creative in their spare time, as well as something athletic (especially outdoors). People in cities tend to be quite reserved and busy, it's not unusual to have to plan meetups a week or more in advance with friends. As a downside, major cities tend to be very appearance and trend focused. Life there is very advanced but at the same time seems a bit simpler.<br>  <br>  It is a great place to live/visit, but I prefer where I live now (Norway) on both culture and landscape.

But its usually much, much less. If your there waiting, don't be intimidated by the bowl of popcorn. you may think it is from a bag, but i assure you it is not. Just ask for a fresh bowl of there spicy popcorn. It is absolutely amazing. <br>  <br>  Carmines. Best. Italian. Food. In.

JEMtVVkBaa	no its not - because carrying a pet is very risky for an airline. The airline must set up the cargo hold in a special way when it has to carry pets. As well as food, water, a vet check before it boards, a vet check after it lands and VIP treatment from aircraft to you.....<br>  <br>  now do you see why it cost so much?|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Because your "carrier" is not free.

In addition, in the event of an emergency, you are going to want to save its life.  This is all an extra liability for the airline, so they need to be compensated for the carriage of your animal.
i47AGNpJaa	Leave your pet at home. What makes you think people with pet allergies want to sit near you on a 12 hour flight, let alone listen to a whining/barking puppy or a mewing cat? Just another example of the "me me me" princess attitude so common in our young people today.|`|AA10832514	Here is a list of airlines that accept pets.  I believe all of them have different policies, but I think Continental is the best.  If I remember correctly, your pet has to be less than 16 pounds and fit in a carrier that will fit under the seat in front of you.  <br>  <br>  Be sure to familiarize yourself with the pet policies of the airline you are flying.

It depends on the size of the pet, as long as it will fit into a small carrier then I'm sure most will allow it.  (not able to take animals out of the country though, they have to be quarantined and such)<br>  <br>  Always check with your airline first.|`|fkHBVn7taa	As far as in the cabins as long as you can fit it in a carry on and able to set it on the floor under the seat you are fine! -- must not be vicious or a mean animal. <br>  <br>  I would most likely check the airline first if they even accept animals and sometimes calling you may get different responses so the best is to actually goto the airport and speak with a ticket agent and ask for they're name ect. . that way when it comes time there is no arguing .|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Southwest, perhaps.  Otherwise, they all charge for the animal and you need to make a reservation in advance as the limit the number of animal on board the aircraft in the cabin.|`|7toznquyaa	Although all the above answers are somewhat correct.  The fact is.. they are NOT FREE.   Most commercial airlines charge between $80 and $200 each way for you pet . in the cabin or in baggage. <br>  <br>  I haven't heard of any that are still free.

I think that's what it means.

The top of the mountains has ice incorporated with the outer layer of the top of the mountains, when the ice melts in spring it causes the mountain outer layer to break easily with the heavy rains that fall at that time, the rain water carries this with it.

DZmsuquraa	Depends on your major and the environment you want.  the substance-free halls do an ok job of keeping it that way.  Libby and Baker are both nice, and last year had less of a drug problem than the other dorms.  But that always depends on the groups of people coming in each year, so the 'party' dorm isn't the same one year by year.  Think about distance from classes, hour breaks between classes aren't pleasant when you have nothing to do but there isn't enough time get to your dorm and back again.

You could easily go to DC or New Orleans, or stretch it farther and go to Chicago or Texas.  Check it out.  There are definitely cooler places then Destin, FL.  I recommnend DC.

pcHp7Dgkaa	1. 4 very large fires are burning out of control at present though no towns are currently threatened by them. Extreme weather conditions today have caused evacuations from the path of at least 2 smaller fires. The current death toll is 210 AFAIK and the number of houses lost about 1500.<br>  <br>  2. Many of the homes destroyed were in small, leafy towns and others were in fairly open farmland. Many were built in bushland settings surrounded by trees and others were close to forested areas. In other words, homes were destroyed in a wide variety of settings. The weather conditions were so extreme that being well away from bushland provided little protection if the property was in the path of the fire. Many Australian eucalypts have light or almost paperlike bark and in hot, windy conditions, embers fly hundreds of metres ahead of the main fire front causing fierce spot fires.<br>  <br>  3. Many homes are equipped with fire fighting equipment and in the past that has been sufficient protection if people stayed to protect their homes. The fires on Black Saturday were so intense that nothing stopped them and people who had stayed became victims either at home or on the roads when it became apparent that staying was pointless.|`|AA11441385	1 No.  <br>  2 Most homes where?  There are lots of homes in small bush townships that are this close to forests.  There are homes in the middle of large cities that are a long way from anything like a forest.<br>  3 Some are - some aren't.  Those that are not so equipped have not survived the onset of the fires.

e6jrBORRaa	Check out the rates on hotels in some of the cities around Atlanta:  Smyrna, Marietta, or even Kennesaw and Acworth.  You'll have to go a little further to get into town, but the drive is not that horrible, and I bet the hotels are cheaper.  If you won't have a rental car, call the hotel to see if they have any shuttles or can recommend transportation going into downtown.  <br>  <br>  I lived in the Atlanta area for 20 years so I never had to actually stay in a hotel there, but the rates around the Marietta area seemed to be like $32 a night and above on the signs I saw.  When I travel, I always check out "Travelocity" or "Orbitz" for the best rates.|`|TbiSBXclaa	Try to make a connection thru your church.|`|eab67f43c0cff3a2dc3c807267bbd536aa	check the list of foreclosured homes around the area and call up bank or mortgage company to offer renting for a week for a group of 6-12, or<br>  <br>  rent a used van for 2, or RV for 6 and camp at TA Travel Center that has facilities you need with few $ like bath rooms, hot spots, foods; etc. Truck and interstates drivers often rest like this when they dont want to stay in motels, very crowd sometimes.<br>  <a href="http://www.tatravelcenters.com/Content/Location.aspx?uid=29" rel="nofollow">http://www.tatravelcenters.com/Content/L...</a><br>  <br>  Exit Guide, Room$aver also offer discount coupons.|`|lEmKvS50aa	I live here in Atlanta and travel quite a bit.

Also check the rooms section as some family homes will rent out a guest room for cheap.

Esta prohibición incluye bebidas, champú, cremas, protectores solares, pasta de dientes o cualquier otro producto de similares características. Dichos artículos se tendrán que transportar en el equipaje facturado. <br>  <br>  Los clientes pueden llevar leche para bebés o zumo si algún bebé viaja a bordo, medicinas con receta a nombre del pasajero que viaja en el avión, insulina y otras medicinas necesarias para el vuelo. Si se adquieren productos de los prohibidos en las tiendas de la zona de embarque éstos no se podrán subir al avión y les serán retirados en la puerta de embarque. <br>  <br>  Iberia ofrece dos vuelos diarios directos a Nueva York, un vuelo diario a Miami, otro a Chicago y cuatro vuelos semanales a Puerto Rico.|`|c60c66180e93b5df2aafb4d9a575db82aa	agua nada liquido nada de maquillaje o pasta de diente o perfume o sprays casi de nada solo puedes entrar con las medicinas y con tu papeles<br>  saludos|`|5ca391a5a40b04022b26e1f7ae3c88acaa	Según tengo entendido solo puedes llevar el papasporte, gafas y sin funda, dinero, compresas si tienes la regla y medicamentos pero tienes que mostrar la receta o prescripcion medica que si no te los quitan (creo que ya permiten llevar un portatil pero no estoy segura).

MGM es xexcelente, magickindong es el sueno de cualquier nino(a), epco es bueno tambien. para mi animal kindong no es nada actractivo, pero es cosa de gustos.<br>  Mi recomendacion es que vas a invertir en una vacaciones en Orlando, ya que estas alli, veas alguno de disney y universal, por lo menos Seaworld, es excelente, pero bueno empisa por dos y con el tiempo el resto.<br>  <br>  suerte

AZgIkmfxaa	Since LAN Chile has the monopoly on internal flights in Chile, they call the shots. Also consider the number of people who travel between Los Angeles and London, compared with the number of people who travel between Santiago and Punta Arenas. The more people who travel between 2 points the lower the cost. <br>  <br>  LAN Chile has several offices in Santiago, plus most of the big department stores have reliable travel services (Falabella, Paris, Ripley). You could also try to book flights through them when you're here. <br>  <br>  You can also take a train from Santiago to Puerto Montt, and then take a combination of buses and ferries to Punta Arenas. Check out the prices to fly from Santiago to Easter Is., if you want a real shock.|`|fkHBVn7taa	sorry captain -- it seems they have quite the monopoly on the routing you are requesting 745 is the cheapest I can find as well.

AA11349530	mmmm ... yes, we do tend to go on and on about our weather, don't we ... but then, it's so fascinating ... it changes all the time (famously you can have three, if not four, seasons all in one day) ... yes it rains but certainly not all the time ... yes it can be depressing at times when it's cloudy and overcast but again that's not all the time ... in fact none of our weather really lasts that long, if we're having a cold spell you can usually guarantee it will pass over in a day or two ... unfortunately that can also be said if we're having a spell of fine weather too ... of course weather affects morale, it's lovely to see the smiles on people's faces when it's sunny, which actually happens quite frequently  <br>  <br>  but I think the best thing about the weather is that it's a great conversation-opener ... you'll find if you come here that a simple comment like "nice day isn't it" will get you started chatting|`|V7lGsaR8aa	The weather can be pretty depressing as you can never be sure what tomorrow brings . Even our summer is not something that you rely on for a period of sun and warmth . We English do like to have something to moan about though and the weather is a certain talking point , if it was not that we would find something else . It does not affect morale at all as our very unique sense of humor conquers anything .<br>  Come to the UK rain , hail , snow , blizzard and you will enjoy yourself . Have a good look around though as the UK does not start and stop in London . There is lots to see and to see it only concisely still takes time . The place is steeped in history.

During the soviet period, it was very good to live there because the wages were third times more than anywhere else in USSR, and we had three months of holidays. But now, wages are the same and the winter conditions are very hard. Some of my relatives are obliged to live there during all the year and it is very bad for health. Only 6% of people living here are local, mostly from the Nenets ethny. The others are form everywhere around (Caucasians, Ukrainians, Chinese, Mongol,....).

Traditional Korean meals are noted for the number of side dishes (banchan) that accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice.[2] Kimchi, a fermented, spicy vegetable dish is usually served at every meal. Korean cuisine usually involves rich seasoning with sesame oil, doenjang (fermented soybean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, and gochujang (red chili paste).|`|fj07gPPlaa	i've got no idea. never been there, and incidentally, nor has about anyone else... o-o is this really a question or something? lol|`|yCdcF3Jcaa	kim Jong-il looks pretty plump to me.

The cell phone lot is tiny (30 spaces), but completely free. But it's only to be used if you are waiting for an arriving passenger. You cannot leave your car if you are parked in this lot. You will find it on the corner of Wardlow and Lakewood Blvd.<br>  <br>  The cheapest all day parking, is Lot D at $11 per day. There is a free, regular shuttle service (every 10 mins) to the terminal. If you need long term parking, Lot D is the only one that is fenced/patrolled.<br>  <br>  There is no completely risk-free, "free parking" nearby. You could try leaving your car at one of the nearby hotels, such as the Marriot, which does offer free self-parking for hotel guests. But if you're not a guest, you risk getting towed, especially if you leave the car overnight.<br>  Skylinks Golf Course is also across the street from Long Beach Airport, but parking there is also meant for patrons only.|`|AzKUBp2Jaa	in  your own driveway why cant you take a van or a taxi or  shuttle<br>  at least you would have a better chance of finding your car back in one piece<br>  otherwise you could a ticket on or it getting towed or getting stolen<br>  or broken into<br>  which would you prefer?|`|5XYlHv6Paa	Park at a Starbucks, and walk to the airport.

En la ma?ana fui a pedir un plano de la ciudad y justo habia otro tipo, un mexicano que tambien queria un plano.

Al contrario, he ido sin compa?ia a muchos lugares cuando era soltera (Brasil dos veces, Colombia, Nueva York, varias partes de Argentina, mi pais, Chile). Siempre encontras a alguien en la misma situacion u otra gente con la cual compartir las vacaciones. Obviamente, no es lo mismo que estar con alguien a quien conoces de toda la vida, pero es buenisimo tambien viajar asi.<br>  Entre sus muchas ventajas, esta la de hacer exactamente lo que queres, sin tener que consensuar con nadie donde vas, a que hora te levantas, que excursion haces o no.

U9pnPXnpaa	You are right, that is indeed a short trip.   <br>  <br>  I would spend it all in the mountains.   While there is a lot to do in Calgary you won't be able to do everything there is in Banff either.  <br>  <br>  Early May you take your chance with the weather.   It will still be very cool at night and in fact, could very well still be snowing.   Or it could be beautiful - you just never know.    Places like Morraine Lake don't even open until June - too much snow.  <br>  <br>  A couple things that would be good to see - <br>  <br>  Banff gondola<br>  Bow Valley Parkway<br>  Icefields Parkway -  one of the most beautiful drive in the world (if it's open..)   <br>  Lake Louise<br>  <br>  I would head to Banff the first day.   Do the gondola, hot springs, Bow Falls maybe.   You won't have much time for anything else.<br>  <br>  Sunday - you could head to the Icefield Parkway early in the morning drive down there and enjoy the scenery, stopping at the beautiful stops along the way if there isn't too much snow.    Then head back to Lake Louise and sleep there for the night.  <br>  <br>  Monday you could explore Lake Louise a bit, drive back to Banff via the Bow Valley parkway - stopping at Johnston Canyon if the weather is good (that's a wonderful hike), shop in Banff or Calgary if you have time.<br>  <br>  I hope you have great weather!!|`|eclS4zT4aa	Banff is really nice anytime of year but it is better known for its winter activities. There is so much more to do in the winter. May is a nice time of year though. You can go see the bow falls, go to Lake Minnewanka Lake to see an underwater village and native culture.You can explore caves, like rat's nest. There is also helicopter tours where you can see the best view of the rocky mountains. <br>  <br>  May can be really rainy in the rocky mountains. Temp. is from 2 oC-14 oC. <br>  <br>  Calgary is alright but I would spend all the time in and around Banff. If you like shopping, Calgary has really good shopping.<br>  <br>  I would think the best time of the year to go is winter or summer but anytime is good because Banff is a really beauitful place.
RCfc9hMKaa	April in Turkey is usually rainy with moderate temperatures. It should be comfortable during the day (in the 50 to 70 range) and cooler at night. You'll want to bring a warm jacket for the evenings. I would suggest looking up the weather a day or two in advance on an online website and writing down the weekly forecast and URL. Then check it whenever you have internet access on your trip. Tourist clothing (shorts, t-shirt, etc) are acceptable in Turkey unless you're going to mosque, in which case you should dress conservatively with no shorts or short sleeves; clothes need to go to the ankle, at least to the elbow, and up to the collar bones with no midriffs. If your clothes are too revealing, you may be given a robe to wear while inside. Headscarves are not necessary but some Turkish women wear light top coats with colorful hijab that cover their hair and neck when out in public. Just wear tidy, neat clothes that you feel comfortable in for walking around to see the sites and bring 1 or 2 more outfits that would be appropriate for a night out. I hope you enjoy your trip, Turkey is a beautiful country! If you get a chance I'd recommend visiting a Turkish bath too. Very cool.|`|fe1fb057c5c82b734b2027481e503befaa	Check out www.weather2travel.com.

b1f833fbeb8f8dde93981f06e0dc7ab0aa	Ich kann Polen als Reiseland nur empfehlen, bin in jedem Jahr mindestens 3mal für 2-3 Wochen dort. Grenzkontrollen gibt es kaum noch(PA oder Reisepass muss vorgezeigt werden), Vom deutschen Zoll werden Stichproben gemacht.<br>  Die Leute in Polen sind sehr aufgeschlossen und meist freundlich. Einige ?ltere den Deutschen gegenüber manchmal misstrauisch, aber wenn man einige Floskeln in polnisch sagt(Guten Tag-djenn dobry, gut - dobsche usw.) tauen sie auf und sprechen dich auch deutsch an.<br>  Unser Auto habe ich immer wieder ohne Verluste nach Deutschland bekommen(parke auf bewachten Parkpl?tzen, oder bei den Privatvermietern)<br>  Gute Reiseziele sind Orte entlang der polnischen Ostsee oder Masurien aber auch das polnische Riesengebirge hat viele sch?ne Ecken.<br>  Viel Spa? beim Erkunden und keine Angst.|`|1a84e504294ddc6a4eb095389ca3f723aa	Ich war im Mai einen Tag in Danzig.

Je mehr man in den Osten kam, umso sch?ner wurde es. In Swinemünde, kurz vor Deutschland war der Nepp am Gr??ten und das Essen am Schlechtesten. Dort hatte ich auch am meisten Bedenken wegen Dieben usw. Unser Auto hatten wir immer auf bewachten Parkpl?tzen stehen mit Parkkralle.

OpyFpKdJaa	Ciao! Io ci sono stata la scorsa estate con 2 amiche e ci siamo divertite moltissimo (anche se abbiamo beccato un tempo orrendo... ma l'anno scorso è stato così un po' dappertutto).<br>  <br>  La vita costa poco... soprattuto per le ragazze le discoteche costano quasi niente.<br>  Poi mi ricordo un litro di sangria a 6 euro, che qui a Milano con 6 euro non te ne prendi neanche un bicchierino!! In tanti locali poi offrivano anche chupito o sangria gratis!!<br>  Poi se uno non ama le discoteche ci sono anche tanti pub carini e locali dove si sta cmq bene.<br>  Lì, sopratutto se sei una ragazza, per i locali paghi quasi niente...! Ma anche i ragazzi risparmiano rispetto ad altri posti!!<br>  <br>  Per l'albergo in mezza pensione, e in un'ottima posizione centrale, ho pagato sui 36-40 euro al giorno ad agosto.<br>  <br>  E poi Barcellona è vicinissima prendendo l'autobus.<br>  La spiaggia è ampissima, ma in agosto molto molto affollata... il mare l'unico giorno che ho potuto fare il bagno ( per colpa del brutto tempo), era pulito.|`|5276c9be6d238d49cf6253e8116316a7aa	sono andata un pò di anni  fa, comunque mi era piaciuta.. vita notturna alle stelle con un milione di discoteche e locali... e soprattutto piena di vita anche d'inverno... uno spettacolo.. cmq mi pare sia a quasi un'ora da barcellona, ora non ricordo bene..|`|BNoIuHa5aa	io ci sono stata a maggio scorso e personalmente mi è piaciuta molto.ci sono discoteche facilmente raggiungibili anche se in un paio la musica non è delle migliori.il clima è come quello italiano con la differenza che alle 9 di sera c è ancora il sole...ci sono viuzze con infiniti negozietti dove si può comprare di tutto e tutto va bene anche con un portafogli non da zio paperone.il mare non è bellissimo...ma è un paesino dove trovi tanti turisti, soprattutto italiani e soprattutto giovani.ciao ciao|`|Wj2rov26aa	CREDO CHE SIA FAMOSA SOLO PER ESSERE LA PRIMA LOCALITA PASSATO IL CONFINE CON SPIAGGIA  E 2 O 3 BAR APERTI FINO A MEZZA NOTTE....ALTAMENTE SCONSIGLIATO!|`|flt8rhAjaa	sn tornata il primo maggio proprio da lì.ho visitato la costa brava ecc...lloret è una mini las vegas:casinò,discoteke,negozi d souvenir e roba varia,ristoranti...c'è tt x l'intrattentimento.c'è anke la spiaggia con la rete da pallavolo.se c devi andare x un viaggio culturale è assolutamente inutile ke c vai se è x altro va bene,xò se c devi stare + d 2 giorni nn ha molto senso.nn c'è nulla da vedere a parte quello ke t ho descritto!<br>  buon viaggio!|`|gS37X3GPaa	DISGRAZIATAMENTE ci siamo andati l'anno scorso:<br>  appena arrivati ci hanno tagliato la gomma dela macchina e derubati di tutti soldi, carte credito, documenti ecc.<br>  Il posto è bruttino, simile alla nostra riviera alto adriatica, ma in più per poter andare al mare devi passare sotto la ferrovia, in pratica ci sono gli hotels, campeggi ecc, poi la strada, poi la ferrovia con i sottopassaggi e poi la spiaggia.<br>  Ancora MALEDICO i soldi che ho speso per andare fino là, quindi, meglio che tu scelga un'altra destinazione.<br>  Buone Vacanze!|`|rd5mHxYraa	Per me è stata la mia prima vera vacanza all'estero e mi sono divertita un mondo.. Di giorno in spiaggia tutto tranquillo, poi alla sera tutto si trasforma, un locale dietro l'altro.. Ti consiglio come discoteca il MOBY'S (sempre se esiste ancora visto che sono passati quasi 5 anni)...|`|zzA2TJOxaa	E' il luogo ideale per una vacanza all'insegna dello sbando!Praticamente ci sono discoteche una attaccata all'altra e un sacco di pub che offrono consumazioni a prezzi veramente bassi......lì gli spagnoli sono una specie protetta....quando ci sono andata io erano tutti italiani!....Durante il giorno ti rilassi in spiaggia oppure fai un salto a Barcellona che dista una buona mezzora da Lloret.....se il tuo obiettivo è quello di divertirti, conoscere tante persone e vivere di notte.....vai pure a Lloret de Mar!|`|E4Qc0Jv0aa	è la Rimini spagnola.. con la differenza che le spiagge nn sono per niente male..<br>  cmq dipende cosa cerchi.. c'è divertimento, tanti ragazzini, vicina a barcellona (bellissima!!!!), ma se vuoi riposo c sono tantissimi altri posti..<br>  i ogni caso io mi sono divertita molto..<br>  Ah!! i prezzi nn sono neanche troppo elevati in confronto qualità prezzo!|`|GXTWr6rpaa	Io sono stata nel 2001 ma come fosse ieri! <br>  Discoteche, localini...e tutto quello che hanno scritto gli altri! Confermo che NON è una località da viaggio culturale ma all'insegna dello sbando puro. E' davvero la Rimini spagnola, anche se personalmente ora che ho 27 anni non ci tornerei, preferirei Ibiza o l'amatissima Formentera (dove però c'è solo una discoteca).<br>  Dipende anche dall'età che hai: so che ultimamente si è popolata di ragazzi molto giovani. Io andai la prima settimana di agosto e c'erano sì molti italiani ma anche tedeschi e olandesi.|`|YYIo3NPKaa	Un casino unico, anche se ritrovi mezza italia lì..se vuoi invece un pò meno paesani e uguale divertimento vai a Salou che si affaccia sulla splendida Costa Dorada, in provincia di Tarragona, sta un pò più in basso rispetto Loret..Ciao|`|cvpc5qvAaa	hei!! LLORET è BELLISSIMA..IO CI SONO STATA QUASI 2 ANNI FA E TI DIKO KE è MERAVIGLIOSA E I DIVERTIMENTI KOSTANO POKISSIMO,,,IO QDO SN ANDATA HO PAGATO 100€ 2 SETTIMANE TRA ALBERGO E DIVERTIMENTI..IO HO ANKE CONOSCIUTO  IL MIO AMORE!!<br>  SE VUOI POI MI RACCONTERAI<br>  PS MI PORTATE ANKE A ME??? ;-P|`|45cc57fde69a210cd29c94ae98ebbe2baa	Sono appena tornata .Bello belissimo.La spiaggia è libera  e ci sono tanti alberghi carini e  si mangia benissimo .Diciamo che è una cittadina  con un lungomare bellissimo ed un centro che non finisce mai.Tutti negozietti  carini dove troverai  di tutto .<br>  Ricorda che il  venerdi sabato e domenica loret è il centro della movida notturna  più famosa della costa e quindi non si dorme!|`|43a648b5d5144c285a815ac59a467869aa	Vai a Rimni è la stessa cosa. Tanto vale che rimani in Italia tanto troverai solo tuoi concittadini a lloret de mar. Vedo tra l'altro che si parla di vacanza da sballo.... ....allora Ibiza cos'è? ....non ci andare.<br>  <br>  Cambia metà.|`|9ff4a8eefecdc85f3dec1d4f1d6b2996aa	carina<br>  <br>  il casinò è incasinato e le sale giochi piene di ragazzotti locali buzzurri che menano i turisti..... ma di giorno è bellissima|`|FtRiLwquaa	tutti dicono che è un' immensa colata di cemento, ma a me sinceramente come posto è piaciuto, in estate c' è molta vita.|`|TgWLC79Haa	Beh io ci sono stata... e mi sono divertita come una matta!!!! vai... e porta tanti amici... ;-)|`|rgMVfDPWaa	ehi..vado anke io forse..! se hai consigli da dare tipo hotel e simili..please dimmi ke siamo in alto maree!! noi andremmo a fine luglio, dopo gli esami!! cmq i miei amici c sn già stati, m hanno solo detto VAI E VEDRAI KE NN VORRAI PIù  TORNARE A CASA!! locali, feste, divertimento allo stato puro..!!

Veja bem, vital, n?o virtual, pense nisso.|`|5d76c974cd07d4c56891d7591583dadaaa	Todos come?amos a ter um "relacionamento" descontraido indesejado, e até interessante pelo fato de senti se acompanhados em muitos momentos de nosso dia.
