I've used yahoo mobile on my psp for awhile now, but all of a sudden when I sign in, while I'm being redirected to my mail it wants to save a file?

HELP :) And since I cant check my emails, I cant receive a notification when someone helps me, so I'll jus search for my post.

20090226163749AArl9vp	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	WOMEN ONLY! MATURE answers too!?	Okay first off, please don't judge me, or say you think it's bad or anything, just answer the questions please... Thanks.      Well, I've been dating my boyfriend for almost two years, and we've talked about sex a lot, but he's never pressured me, and he says whenever I'm ready he'll be ready. I know for sure right now, I'm ready and I've gone threw everything with my mom, we have condoms, and I'm on birth control, so I'm not some dumba*s, also, I'm over the legal age, so don't think about that either. I'm just super concerned with pain, and I really can never handle it.. EVER. So..         1.) How bad does it hurt on a scale from 1-10?? 1 being ehh, not at all. 10 being UNBEARABLE, terrible pain.      2.) What EXACTLY does it feel like during the entering or first thrust?      3.) If I was drunk would it be less painful?      4.) I asked my boyfriend if he could maybe drug me or something, so I wouldn't feel it, he said he doesn't really want to, but would I feel pain then?      I'm so scared of pain, but so ready for sex, I STILL can't put in a tampon because it hurts so bad, so please answer the questions.         I promise promise promise, I'm not a troll, I'm serious, please and thank you   1 minute ago - 4 days left to answer.
