If you were to put one in every room then no....they are highly inefficent compared to gas. i|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Don't believe the adds you read about some new technology that lets you get 75% or more heat out of a device using the same amount of energy.   All electric heaters are 100% efficient- all the power that goes into them is converted to heat.      I'd suggest buying a 4X8 sheet of foam insulation at a hardware store and cutting it down to fit in your windows.   Put it in every night and when you're at work if the sun doesn't come in the window.    Blocking heat from escaping is easier and cheaper than making more heat to replace what's lost.|`|dUWqW27paa	Yeah it is called the sun.|`|j4i7TJM5aa	Since electric heaters are  short circuits you only get what you put into them if you have a choice of heating use the old fashion radiant heat.  thats when hot water goes through piping in the whole house.  Way less expensive and as a bonus a lot less stuff blowing around with the normal fan vents.

It's an issue only to the degree that a lot of self-righteous people insist that governments waste resources dealing with this non problem.  What makes it ethical or rather unethical is the nonsense posing as science that supports this.  Compared to AGW, the Salem Witch Trials look positively rational.|`|ef127c71fbf45406959cf7932ceb098daa	Yes, as it is a made to order socialistic ploy to create a false problem with always a government solution; the solution being controls on free enterprise and production via so-called "fix the problem" laws. The moral question is whether the Lemming mentality will march us into more socialistic BS.|`|zNB3tZXraa	Only if it really existed.|`|1fee420808aabf67636dc09772eb45cfaa	Absolutely.      What right do China and India have to build 500+ more coal plants now that we know how harmful they are to everyone on the planet?      How dare the United Nations clearly document the severity and dangers of global warming through its IPCC reports, but then hypocritically suggest that the majority of humans on the planet emitting over 50% of the CO2 (and with the highest emission growth rates by far) be exempt from emission controls!  Any solution that does not start with China is a farce.|`|n6xqkPhXaa	Yes.  Those responsible for promoting it are unethical, and the international community has to stand up against them.|`|UgTHAsISaa	Of course. If we don't take action soon to mitigate and adapt to the coming global warming, then it's clear that the effect of climate change are expected to negatively affect billions of people in the decades to come.|`|eqohYHedaa	I would most certainly considered Global Warming an International issue as well as an ethical one. The human population needs to start taking precautions in protecting the Earth. It is clearly effecting the entire Planet. If you have watched the documentary by Al Gore he makes a very strong and convincing point that will make a believer out of anyone who disagrees with the fact that our Earth needs to be taken better care of. There are tons of little things that everyone can do every day that will help.
NfcaC4xCaa	Logistical curves can initial be exponential but have a change in the curves direction once saturation is reached.    That is there is a limited factor that a population reaches then declines.    For example say a locust plague. The locust population increases exponetial to begin with (that is population increases rapidly over time) but then the population reaches a point of saturation (no more food to eat), so then the population tapers off and will plateau at a sustainable population (thus forming a logistic curve)    Check out the links if you want a less confusing and not so leymann terms explanation.
