vvgmyX04aa	I think it is bogus and probably just another made-up word by people who are insecure about the idea of a world with true equality of the sexes.    "women delight in being girlish but at the same time sophisticated, happy women who know what they want but are not man-haters or manly."    That statement describes me pretty well and I consider myself a feminist and damn proud of it.    But do you realise those are personal traits and don't affect the basic concept of feminism that men and women are full and equal human beings..?      Edit, a letter carrier is a person who delivers mail to your adresses. Called the mail man in the US but some are women.  English is my second language too :)|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I'm not a post-feminist by any stretch of the imagination. I don't like being girlish, I don't want to be a mother (although I respect women who do), and I'll wear a suit if the setting requires it.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	For feminism to be "over" the goals have to be accomplished. I don't see that that is the case.    Furthermore, those that abandon the "old" feminism for some new shallow feminism wrapped up in consumption and the denial of oppression are the ones operating with a mistaken idea of reality and feminism.    So what do I think of post-feminism? I think it doesn't exist. And people who do think it exists are fooling themselves.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	"the era of feminism is over and we're in an age of post-feminism where women delight in being girlish but at the same time sophisticated, happy women who know what they want but are not man-haters or manly." - If that's true I don't see why we see chicks running around calling themselves Feminists in the West anymore, or that they went to college BECAUSE of Feminism.|`|XwqePXrOaa	What is post-feminism?    According to different scholars, we're either in an extension of first- or second-wave feminism that hasn't yet completed, or we're in something completely new called 'third-wave feminism,' or we've gotten to 'post-feminism' (which seems to suggest that the feminist movement is complete, which isn't very popular with anyone).    What do you define post-feminism to be, and why are we in it?|`|1HfLkTrdaa	Letter carrier's rights lol.    j/k    I think so-called post-feminism is just a way of being anti-feminist. It's just one generation rejecting the values of another. Example?  in the 50s, the attitude was "marry a doctor to succeed"  During the feminist era, the attitude was "why marry a doctor, when I can go to school and become a doctor myself"  Now the attitude is back to "why should I bang my head against the glass ceilling? I'll just marry a doctor and have what I want. "    EDIT    The first part was meant to be a joke. Post = letter.   So one who gets paid to deliver post (mail or letters) would be a letter carrier.  I guess no one got the joke...including the thumbs-downer. Oh well...

Each solar system represented their "RACE" or species.  Our solar system was a represented by a gentleman with a long hair and robe similar to like "Moses" or "Jesus" type of figure.  Other species defined us as a human race, then we evolved into something greater which I can't explain easily.. <br>  <br>  I could view the time line in our history and see that our human species had evolved and then moved back into the black empty space again looking at Earth with the long robe/hair, which asked me a question.  "Do you know what Earth represents?"  He just explained how everything worked... Like who we are, what the purpose/meaning of life, and what other species are out there and what their purpose is...  <br>  <br>  Strange/Weird Dream 2)<br>  I had an interesting dream. I am not an expert in math and barely passed calculus. I want to find out the reasoning of why this is always true. So please Math wizards or experts help me solve this logic.<br>  <br>  My dream was revolved around the number 6 and # 9. For some reason I could figure out that any number in any sequences (except starting with 0) would always come up with a whole number. Example: Divide this number by 9 in any sequence you like and you will always get a whole number, but you have to use all of these numbers.<br>  <br>  2,418,475,428,529,624,793,358<br>  <br>  Here was the YAHOO ANSWER- The reason this always works for #9 is because a number is evenly divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. * (The sum of the digits in your example is 108 which is divisible by 9). Since the sum of the digits will always be the same regardless of the order of the digits, any number formed with these digits will be divisible by 9.<br>  <br>  *Proof:<br>  let a number X be written:<br>  X = a(0)*10^n + a(1)*10^(n-1) + a(2)*10^(n-2) + ... + a(n-1)*10 + a(n)<br>  where a(0), a(1), a(2), ..., a(n-1), a(n) are the digits of the number.<br>  <br>  WIERD/SAD DREAM 3) ----<br>  Quick synopsis- My biological mother past away in 1996...  Since, I was adopted I was always looking to find my biological family (mother).  And I had this dream in 1998.  <br>  <br>  I climbed up on a hill and saw it was bright and sunny  day out.   Suddenly, there was a woman with a long black robe/dress running away from me....  I quickly tried to follow her... (no clue why I was following her)...   She kept running away from me and then finally I got smart and tracked her to somewhere in the UNDERGROUND...   This woman didn't know I was following her and turned around and looked at me and said, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!"  I asked who are you!!!   She replies your not suppose to be here... Then I started to look at her face it and I just got a sense that this woman knew me somehow...  I had some hunch that I knew her too but I did not know where from.. She told me TO LEAVE THIS PLACE AND Please don't come back..  I kept insisting she tell me who she is... Then she calls out my NAME and then I just knew that it was my biological mother...  I told her I am not leaving and I will find you!!!!  I woke up and in fall 1998 I began my search to find her...  All I could remember was the location was underground and near a hill..  <br>  <br>  It was sad to find out my biological mother passed away.  I heard the news in 1999 that she had past away and was buried up on a hill....  I went to go and visit her grave...  It was sad........|`|13eb2c2e09984b58ac34a3ed3f77279aaa	I worked as a surgeon in a hospital and I had built up enough credit with the hospital to get a free amputation.

It sounds like you just called her names back. Also, i hate to be alittle harsh...But um....ITS YOUR WIFE. Why in the hell would your own wife call the police to have you arrested for calling her names after she called you some? I've never heard this....<br>  <br>  "So what did you go to jail for?"<br>  "Oh I called my wife a jackass...."<br>  <br>  I know its harsh to say but the VAWA as far as I know only covers anything dealing with physical assualt to mental abuse. Which in todays times. You have to do quite a bit for it to be considered mental abuse. They have to be able to show that what you called them really affected who and how they are.<br>  <br>  Now if you hit her.....Your **** out of luck if she called the police...Thats call there is to it.<br>  <br>  Once again sorry for being so blunt and harsh.<br>  But remember you and your wife arent kids anymore, your adults.|`|1168bcccfff6f3a578ef3a0223e4cce5aa	No VAWA oer here we have something proposed called the "Equality bill" which will legalise muder for a woman who feels 'wronged' by the action or conduct of their partner; while removing defences for a husband who kills his wife in a fit of rage if she cheats.|`|eBMKmgCjaa	YES. Guys, you really need to know about this issue because if you presume you have equal rights to a woman you might find yourself needing a lawyer VERY quickly. <br>  <br>  VAWA is obviously skewed in favour of women, but that is only part of the problem. In the US today the term 'domestic violence' has been expanded to include simply being "afraid" or "fearful" of harm from your partner. Two thirds of US states include in their definition "psychological distress" and a third include "harassment". <br>  <br>  Does this work the same for men and women? Yeah right. Can you imagine a man insisting that his wife is arrested because he says she is harassing him? There is a good chance that he will be arrested instead, as happens to about 20% of male domestic violence victims who seek help from the police in the UK  <a href="http://www.dewar4research.org/DOCS/PlightOfMaleVictimsSummaryMay08.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dewar4research.org/DOCS/Pligh...</a>  <br>  <br>  In the real world this definition of domestic violence only works when the accusation is made by a woman. In the opinion of Elaine Epstein, former president of the Massachusttes Bar Association,  because the definition is so wide, it is wide open to abuse: "In many cases, allegations of abuse are now used for tactical advantage". <br>  <a href="http://www.onlinelawyersource.com/news/false-allegation-domestic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinelawyersource.com/news/f...</a><br>  <br>  Other countries have variations on this them (see link below). In India its pretty straightforward: if you insult your wife you are fined and go to jail.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  Feminists have been campaigning to get $875 million of taxpayer's money to spread VAWA to 20 countries <a href="http://www.capwiz.com/now/issues/alert/?alertid=10947751" rel="nofollow">http://www.capwiz.com/now/issues/alert/?...</a>

It's sexism at its worst. It isn't confined to the wives of Democratic presidents either. I recall how catty the media became towards Nancy Reagan. She was criticized for everything from her extravagant tastes in clothing to her very slender frame. Many people thought that she was acting as the president instead of Ronald. She was known to not get along with some of his cabinet members and apparently was instrumental in getting one of them fired (Treasury Secretary Donald Regan).|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	Well I thinks it because of the crap that has come out of her own mouth!

For one, we can't control another person's value system or how they judge others. When I realized most people have a very skewed sense on how they judge things, I stopped valuing their opinions of me. I started working on validating myself.

I and my husband are huge MMA fans and some of the leagues have female MMA fighters, we both find it very anti climactic to see to small girls trying tp beat the piss out of each other.

However, gender inequality in sports was going on long before TV existed. Secodly, the development of professional women's sports from Basketball has been huge and gets pretty good air time.

I worry about you, and think of you more often than you realize. Considering what we've spoken of in the past, it's a pretty natural dream for you to have. Two thoughts come to mind immediately: first, if he does something really awful, then you don't have to feel as guilty about the past; second,if he does something really awful it's what you deserve for not being as good a wife as you think you should be. I don't know how you're doing, but if things haven't changed much, I'm afraid you're going to continue to have threatening dreams. I'd like to be more specific, but I just can't write what I'd like to on Yahoo Answers. If you are taking care of yourself, the dreams will change in time, and the danger of fantasy becoming reality will cease....if it exists at all. Take care of yourself! I know you better than you think I do. I know you because we have so much in common, and I understand. You're a far better person than you think you are. Starla, get that book, "The Spirituality of Imperfection." If you think it worthless, you'll have wasted a few dollars.

lwG6tvOqaa	I can relate to you. Sometimes in certain situations, i get so quiet that everyone keeps asking me what is wrong, which REALLY irritates me. Other times when i am in groups, i turn into a social butterfly, and i love the feeling of people listening to what i have to say. I especially love it when they laugh at my stories, because they think they are funny.<br>  <br>  Most of the time, people are quiet, because they have learned to be that way, because they are so used to people talking over them or acting like they don't care about what they have to say. That feeling sucks when you feel like no one is listening to you.<br>  <br>  Anyway, i would stay out of groups that i can't really relate to, because no one wants to sit there like the "quiet" one. If you can't help but be in those groups, then i would occasionally jump into the conversation and say things like "really, i didn't know that." or "Wow", or just little things that may draw some attention to you so that people will at least know that you CAN talk. MAybe that will even give you a chance to speak or throw your two cent in the matter.|`|bit5P4Dwaa	talk to them as if your acting but be yourself!<br>  <br>  i have this trouble and usually i find that the best thing i can do is be interested in the convo and act as if it is very important that i chat like on a game show!!!hahaha<br>  in time it will become easier!<br>  but seriously talk about ANYTHING!people will like you better cos they will see that you talk and are fun to be with!|`|SKJsfRImaa	I have had the same problem! What I have learned to do in groups in college and in social settings is to ask a question at the beginning of the session. This shows interest and helps me feel like I am a part of the group. If you wait too long to speak up you will just feel more and more awkward as you just sit there. Once you begin talking you will feel more comfortable and participation will come easier. It takes practice but it should get easier every time. Good luck!

b5ad6e44e0086d316700f9b6713407c6aa	Yeah- what Ted said. You ask a question, Yahoo pulls up a little sidebar that says "We might have an answer" and lists questions like yours that have been asked and resolved. It baffles me that people are still asking this question. <br>  <br>  Yahoo should make a sidebar that pops up when this question is asked that says "man did not evolve from monkeys and apes, we share a common ancestor" Seeing the question 5 times a day is annoying.|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	This question gets asked so often that some people in Religion & Science have made a drinking game of it; every time someone asks, they take a drink. You may get some answers that say "Swig" or "Gulp" or "Thanks for the excuse to drink". That's what they mean. If you do a search on "still monkeys" and "still apes" you'll get roughly 2 - 3 per day since YA started. <br>  <br>  Here is a short answer:<br>  <br>  Because they evolved from our common ancestor too. We humans got smarter. The great apes, including chimpanzees, got bigger or stronger. A 180-pound chimp would wipe the floor with a 180-pound human, even a college wrestler. A 400-pound gorilla would wipe the floor with a 180-pound human too.<br>  <br>  If you were just curious, stop reading this and go look up "Evolution" on Wikipedia. <br>  <br>  If you wanted to argue against evolution, here is a little something extra for you, what the Cajuns call "lagniappe", like the free cookie the baker gives the kids when Mom buys a big birthday cake:<br>  <br>  Back in 1776, monarchists (Monarchists are people who want to be ruled by a king or queen, not butterfly fanciers.) argued against democracy as a form of government. They said it was absurd to believe that "All men are created equal" because anyone could see men came in different heights, weights and colors. Case closed.<br>  <br>  My point is not about democracy. It is about debate. Before you argue about something, you should understand it. If you don't understand it, you'll look foolish. One night on the "Saturday Night Live" TV show, Gilda Radner argued vehemently against the "Deaf Penalty", instead of the "Death Penalty". She looked absurd and we all laughed until the beer came out our noses, which was what she wanted. You don't want people to laugh at you.<br>  <br>  In a serious debate, you should understand the other side. Note that I didn't say "Believe". Understanding is not the same as believing. If you were to study 20th century European Political history, you would have to understand several forms of government: communism (the USSR), fascism (Germany, Italy), socialism (Lots of countries), socialist democracy, capitalistic democracy and constitutional monarchy. You would not believe in all of them; you COULD not believe in all of them at once. If you tried, your head would explode. You would, however, have to understand their basic concepts. <br>  <br>  If you were to study comparative religion, you would have to understand what Jews, Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Taoists and Confucians believe. You would not have to convert to a new religion every week, but you would have to understand the other ones. You would not get very far in your studies if you dismissed all the other ones as "wrong". They believe their path is the right one just as strongly as you believe your path is the right one.<br>  <br>  99% of the biologists alive today believe that species evolve, and that the theory of evolution is the best explanation we have for the diversity of life.  Christian biologists, Jewish biologists, Muslim biologists, Hindu biologists, Buddhist biologists; Australian, Bolivian and Chinese biologists; 99% of them believe it is the best explanation. Yes, it is only a theory. Planetary motion - the theory that the earth went around the sun, not vice versa - was only a theory for a long time. Some people still don't believe it.<br>  <br>  If you are truly curious, ask your minister to give you a short, reasoned explanation of evolution. Tell him you don't want to believe it, of course; you just want to understand it. If he says he can't because it is wrong, he is as ignorant as those monarchists I mentioned above.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	The monkeys and apes that you see today are the product of their own line of evolution. Their ancestors didn't face the same environmental pressures that ours did and therefore humans evolved one way and orangutans evolved in their own way. <br>  <br>  An organism isn't pre-wired to evolve into another organism. The process of gaining or losing traits is pushed along by the environment and natural selection. <br>  <br>  Evolution isn't a mutation, it is the process of making an organism better suited for their environment, one trait at a time. <br>  <br>  I hope this makes sense!|`|pHbbLoXraa	Humans and apes both evolved from a coman ancestor. From genetics and archology it is estimated that humans and chimpanzees went there seperate ways about 7 million years ago. Although it is true that superficially Chimpanzees will seem to have more in common with the coman ancestor than humans as they live in a similar niche and enviroment chimpanzees have not stopped evolving and will have genetic diferences to the comon ancestor.<br>  <br>  Chimpanzees seperated by the the Congo river two and a half million of years ago have evolved into two seperate species the Bonobos and pan trogladyties (Comon Chimpanzees) which have developed quite different social structures and physicks.<br>  <br>  The comon ancestors of humans and chimps split up 7 million years ago one staying in the niche of rain forest tree climber the other adopting bypedalism to live in more open enviroments.|`|DCltkysDaa	This question has been asked a thousand times, it simply reflects the fact that people are not reading.

Also burning some lavender oil or a lavender candle will help you sleep as lavender is commonly used to help us relax. <br>  <br>  So once you start to get a better sleep routine if you're still tired assess your diet. You may need to add more red meat and green leafy vegetables in your diet for iron or you can also take iron supplements (but be picky with which ones you get because some can cause constipation). <br>  <br>  And if all that fails go see your doctor to get your blood tested.|`|YeUjmP7Uaa	you apparently don' get enough sleep. <br>  <br>  maybe you should try aromatherapy, or listening to soothing music and try to fall asleep. <br>  <br>  try sounds of nature, or the ocean.<br>  <br>  help me??<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aszd4BnkjjZE.pa7e0p2W4jsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220204645AAxvp0g">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|aM5FTVvXaa	you're always tired because you're not sleeping enough. i wake up sometimes during the night also. what my mom does sometimes to get to sleep is to just take a Benedryl, it makes you drowsy enough to sleep a full 8 hours.|`|NVyCF9llaa	do u go on the comp or watch tv b4 you go to sleep? if so...try to relax at least a half an hour b4 you go to sleep (meaning no tv, and comp) because for some reason, looking at a screen messes with ur brain when you try to sleep (idk...my doctor said so) haha.

4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	In some ways, I did.  I also had a dysfunctional family.  And I went through a cynical, jaded period too, but thank God it wasn't that long.  Cynical, jaded adults ARE immature, in my humble opinion.  It sound perhaps like you are indignant that your peers are able to behave like kids and you haven't had that luxury.  One of the most important thing you can hear from me is that, while your rough childhood may have significantly contributed to your negative, bitter stance in life, you are fully capable of choosing to handle things differently.  If you are still in school, I would strongly encourage you to start meeting with your school counselor to start working through the ugly stuff from your childhood.  You still have the chance to not only be a much healthier adult, but you can also have a much healthier adolescence.  Best wishes to you.|`|4oI9FyJRaa	MY NAMES JADE haha sorry but yeah so did i since i was about nine i had to take care or my sisters in between an abusive father and neglecting babysitters. thinking about it it hurts your heart so much that you didn't completely get to be a kid like someone stole something from you and you can't report it or get it back.<br>  then now i'm sixteen and i'm alot wiser than people i know because i did grow up to fast.<br>  so it's unfair but some good things come out of it sometimes.|`|ixmaM395aa	You need to let go of this attitude you have right now or else you'll end up very bitter when you're in your 20's. Sorry you've had it rough but be one of the strong ones that takes their pain & turns it into a positive. <br>  <br>  And in answer to your question, I don't feel I grew up to fast. I just went with the pace life gave me.|`|B3uvhA7kaa	Yes. Immensely fast. I'm only 13 and I don't find a lot of things funny that other people my age do. I wouldn't consider myself immature. In fact, I'm always wanting to grow up more than I'm allowed to or more than is possible to achieve. I guess, in my case, it semmed from a rough childhood. But I'd rather be mature than immature. :)|`|YhAhxumVaa	Even at the age of 12 I thought I had the mind set of someone at least 17. A rough childhood definitely forces your mind to basically 'cut the crap' and grow up so that ultimately you can defend and protect yourself from societies cruel reality. A dysfunctional family makes the one place that should be a safe haven for you become more of a task. Many children are growing up too fast, a lot of people will blame the media but it really is based entirely on your personal life, home life being the biggest factor. It all depends on the type of person you are too, all of my life I've been very shy and exclusive as in who I am able to talk to comfortably. I've displayed that in many different ways, obvious shyness to slight rudeness to avoid being taken advantage of. This shyness led to being what I think is socially disordered, I had such a hard time making friends and all I wanted to do was be accepted. In the 4th grade I started cutting myself, I think I used it as physical pain to make me not feel such emotional hurt. Obviously, that was a stupid choice because there isn't even any logic behind that. A childhood is essential, and it's terrible that so many things can take that away from us.|`|M0vQFHg9aa	Life is short, I live life too fast.<br>  <br>  But, no, I guess I'm like any normal person who started understanding how life sucks at the age of nine. Learning that money is valuable, as is time, and how to work all the Appliances in the house. I had a fairly normal and steady childhood.|`|HaDR9veDaa	i feel the same way and have a similar circumstance i KNOW that i grew up to fast. i just wonder what the physcological reason for this is|`|9d2aOK36aa	well yeah, I haven't gotten enough time to play around with my toys. I am not ready to go to college >>|`|Fu1emcF3aa	Yes and No.<br>  <br>  I'm 17. Mentally, (excluding the sexuality sector of my mind) I was fully matured by the age of 16. I'm more mature than most 35 year-old men. I'd say the average person's mind is fully matured by the age of 30 (with the exception of people like you and me.) I kind of like it like this though. The thing is I over-analyze things far too much and have had depression which I believe is probably worse than clinical (is there such thing?) Your state of mind is not necessarily due to a dysfunctional family though it may play a part in it. You just have a more advanced mind set and the dysfunction might have contributed to it. For me, I know why I matured so quickly. My parents are from a different country (Ireland) so I have literally grown up without family. My dad was raised on a farm and is very stern and never really showed affection to me at all. The only person I really ever received affection from is my mom. Don't get me wrong, I love my parents, but they're not like those real American parents if you know what I'm talking about.<br>  <br>  And I know what you mean. Kids in my school are extremely immature compared to me. They seem to think sexual humor is hilarious and not a single sentence can come out of the average person's mouth at my school without a sexual reference. All they do is talk about partying.<br>  <br>  So yes, I grew up fast, but not "too" fast since I am highly pleased with the result of my maturation.
cAMleGWlaa	I'm sure that what happens after you die is the same whether or not you die alone. But the events before your death will obviously be made more difficult if you are alone. <br>  Have you ever seen the movie "Into the Wild"? Well in the End, Chris McCandless is alone and though we see him cry for the first time in the whole movie, he is at the same time grateful for the live he lived. <br>  So I suppose then if you have lived a full and happy life, dying alone might not be so bad, but if you have regretted things and feel that there is still a lot that you wish to accomplish, then you will probably be more afraid of death as you still feel that you have more to do in your life and coming to this realization by yourself in your final minutes would surely make anyone feel sad, isolated, and even worthless. <br>  If you die with people around you, they usually help to comfort you and being alone makes this transition slightly harder to bear as you left to ultimately comfort yourself as you leave this world behind and transcend (or descend) into the next one.|`|ToILKl6waa	I would assume that none of us have yet experienced this, but there is a fine line between loneliness and solitude.

ij8fUn1Qaa	The monarchy of Canada, or Canadian monarchy,[1][2] is a constitutional system of government in which a hereditary monarch is the sovereign and head of state of Canada,[3] forming the core of the country's Westminster style parliamentary democracy.[4] The terms Crown in Right of Canada, Her Majesty in Right of Canada, or The Queen in Right of Canada may also be used to refer to the entire executive of the government of Canada. Though the Canadian Crown has its roots in the French and British Crowns, it has evolved over the centuries to become a distinctly Canadian institution,[5] represented by unique symbols, and sometimes being colloquially dubbed the Maple Crown;[6] a term first coined by Governor General Lord Grey in 1905.[7]<br>  <br>  The present monarch is Elizabeth II – officially titled Queen of Canada (French: Reine du Canada) – who has reigned since February 6, 1952. She, her consort and other members of the Canadian Royal Family undertake various public and private functions across Canada and on behalf of the country abroad. However, the Queen is the only member of the Royal Family with any constitutional role, holding ultimate executive authority,[4][8] though her Royal Prerogative remains bound by laws enacted by her in parliament and by conventions and precedents,[3] leaving the day-to-day exercise of executive power to her Cabinet. While several powers are the sovereign's alone, most of the royal constitutional and ceremonial duties in Canada are carried out by the Queen's representative, the Governor General;[3] as such, the Governor General can sometimes be referred to as the de facto head of state.[9] In each of Canada's provinces the monarch is represented by a lieutenant-governor.[3] The territories are not sovereign, and thus do not have a viceroy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ok thats what i think email well i got it of wiki so tell me if this works ok if it does nothing is owed like you said to me ok cause thats what friends are for|`|WAOkgdj6aa	I'm not sure what your exact questions are... so here are websites that will help you with each question.<br>  <br>  Parliament: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_...</a><br>  <br>  Federal Government: <a href="http://www.blakes.com/DBIC/guide/html/federal_government.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.blakes.com/DBIC/guide/html/fe...</a><br>  <br>  Monarch:<br>   --"Canada's Monarch is Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom."<br>  <a href="http://www.sts-education.co.za/south_africa/hs/programme_countries/canada/canada/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sts-education.co.za/south_afr...</a><br>  <br>  Constitutional monarchy:<br>  <br>  --"Canada is a constitutional monarchy.

You need to learn to stand up for yourself and have confidence.  It took 3 years of theater class to learn to be who I wanted to be.  People only walk all over you if you let them.  Learn how to say 'no' nicely.  Find out what makes you happy.<br>  <br>  5) Will any of you who care be my friend?  A-You have friends who care.  :)<br>  <br>  And I don't think these are depressing thoughts, but real questions.  And it has been no waste of time Rebekka.|`|IRFe95eLaa	1.  Its better to have 1 or 2 great friends who will stick by you through anything than 100 "fair weather" friends who only hang around when things are good and they are bored.  Maybe you should evaluate your friendships more.<br>  <br>  2.  Sorry, honey, but getting a guy your age to be romantic will be near impossible.  you might be mature enough for romance, but most teenage guys are not....wait a few years, it will get better.<br>  <br>  3.  There is nothing wrong with having a crush on a guy you'll never date...but don't say never b/c you never know what the future holds for you.<br>  <br>  4.  Don't let ppl walk all over you.  Stand up for yourself b/c you deserve to be respected.  The world does not depend on you, if you really think about it, there are very few (if any) things we do in life that ever affect entire world, and lots of things you do today won't matter in a year anyway.  Try to focus on now and if you get stressed, just ask yourself if it will even matter next year (or even next week).<br>  <br>  5.  You can call me your friend if you want.  I don't give out personal info online, I never give out my real name or location, but if it helps at all, I care about you and hope you feel better about life soon.<br>  <br>  ~"Riku"|`|mNjYQr5Oaa	Your 15 years old. Youre going to be going through alot in your life. You really shouldn't be worried about so much when your so young. I admit, I stress alot too, but you should channel your stress and worries into something positive. If your friends are too busy, or like you said, they don't seem to care, maybe bring it up casually and confront them about it. If that doesn't work, then those friends arn't worth your time. You don't need a boyfriend...honestly, you're too young to need someone who's romantic. Just have fun!  I hope this helps! Good Luck.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Your 15 and you don't  have all that stuff on your list? wow!! you must be behind...|`|UmMxmmRMaa	1. I don't know, sorry.

It might be stupid, but it happens. A lot. And don't think that it will never happen! Anything is possible..<br>  <br>  4. You're a teenager.<br>  <br>  5.

It is the very question most will ignore their entire lives.<br>  <br>  1) Most likely because you do have little amounts of friends that care.  This is the reality, we tend to realize that, despite knowing 100's of people, only a VERY few small amount will be there during the tough times. Why? Well, of all the people you know, would you be there for every single one of them if they all needed your help? Chances are, no. You may say yes, but reality is different then what we often think.<br>  <br>  2) Because you are a female and have desires to be involved with a male.  It's normal.  Are you questioning the idea of being in a relationship, altogether?  You may wish to feel loved or pampered, who doesn't? This is Desire and a very big topic.<br>  <br>  As well, media and what you're exposed to says that this is the path you should follow and if you don't, you're "weird."  I don't want to focus on media too much.<br>  <br>  3) No, it's quite normal - mostly everyone will be in this scenario. We want what we can't have and that only amplifies our desire to want it.  A deeper question is "what is desire?" and "how do we control it?"<br>  <br>  4) Do you stand up for yourself or are you considered "nice?"  People may be walking over you because you're letting them.  Learn to be more confident, there are numerous ways.  <br>  <br>  5) Internet relationships are not very fulfilling and I'm much too old. However, I don't mind taking the time to answer a question or 2.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	1) You probably feel this way because your friends are too busy or preoccupied with other things to show you how much they care about you.<br>  <br>  2) You feel this way because that is the way that the media and school make you feel. It sucks living up to these expectations.<br>  <br>  3) No, there is nothing wrong with feeling this way. All girls fantasize about being with someone that they know that they will probably never have  chance with. I've seen a lot of boys who would reject me in a second if they knew that i liked them. They are just good eye candy.<br>  <br>  4) You feel that the world is on your shoulders/being walked all over because you have experienced too much of being taken advantage in a short amount of time.<br>  <br>  5)I would be your friend as long as your are not two-faced,fake,criticize too much,too narrow-minded, abusive,etc. I am going to add you to my contacts right now Rebekka.<br>  <br>  BTW You are not wasting our time.

Without the important element of hope, then the emotion is anxiety, not angst.

PN7ELn3aaa	Archaeology is one of the four branches of Anthropology. <br>  <br>  Anthropology is a broad term that encompasses:<br>  <br>  1. "cultural anthropology" or the study of cultures, both past and present. This branch focuses on philosophy, psychology, religion, lineages, recognition of kinship, interaction, gender roles....etc. Pretty much anything that people do and why they do it. Anthropologists who study "living cultures" are known as "ethnographers". They kind of make a history of the cultures they study...their writings and studies are known as ethnography. <br>  <br>  Cultural anthropologists can study cultures from a historical standpoint as well. Franz Boas was a HUGE figure in anthropology and he was big on "historical particularism". He studied trends in histories and the evolutions of cultures. <br>  <br>  Cultural anthropologists also search for "universal truths" between cultures. (Does EVERYONE have a religion? How are they related...etc...)<br>  <br>  2. Physical anthropology deals with biological aspects of humans. This encompasses everything from regional variation in human traits (what are perceived as different "races") to the whole theory of evolution and how we became what we are now. Genetics, biology and anatomy are big here.<br>  <br>  3. Linguistic anthropology focuses on language...spoken, written, context, sound...you name it. <br>  <br>  4. Archaeology is the study of human remains (both physical and things they've created or altered) in their original context. Archaeology is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle of history. It helps to have a good understanding of cultural anthropology to be able to "assume" things about your archaeological site. <br>  <br>  All of the branches of anthropology work together to create a big picture but the science itself is REALLY intensive so most likely an anthropologist will focus on one single area for their own projects.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|nG9nxMySaa	anthropology is the study of humans. there are 4 sub-fields of anthropology, one of which is archaeology (the others are cultural anthropology, physical anthropology, and linguistic anthropology.)<br>  <br>  archaeology involves material artifacts, usually from digs. these are artifacts related to human life, so someone who digs for dinosaur bones is not an archaeologist. archaeologists use these artifacts to study human life.<br>  <br>  archaeology is a TYPE of anthropology. archaeologists are anthropologists but not all anthropologists are archaeologists. <br>  <br>  if you want to study archaeology in college (or general anthropology) you will probably be in the anthropology department. check your prospective schools' websites to read more about their anthropology departments and feel free to contact the department heads for more information about their programs.|`|DCltkysDaa	People from the USA will say the archaeology is a 'sub field' of anthropology, in the UK where we train the worlds best archaeologists we say that's nonsense. They are quite different subjects, archaeology is the study of the human past through material remains, it's an exact skill, one that uses evidence. Anthropology is still struggling to define itself, and moreover it is stuffed full of theoretical nonsense,  most of which is not evidence based at all. Of course our US friends will disagree, and that's why we don't usually let them excavate in the UK until we have re-educated  them.|`|K2ecmzInaa	Archeology is the study of artifiacts of the past and whatnot.

You should get your vitamin levels tested from a nutritionist, talk to your parents about it though, nothing to be embarrassed about.|`|RX4nj825aa	do your parents know?????
cee27a373f64a299e31c2d3af3a93660aa	It's manipulation. It's all in the mind. My mother didn't leave my father for 14 years because she felt like she needed to please him in order to function and felt like she needed to support her children. Unfortunately, nothing good came out of the marriage. It's the abuser who makes the recipient that they are not worthy of anything else in life and somehow believe it.|`|bc6e45a0c84a380c304815c62b269325aa	Most of those women have a false sense of love. They think he will eventually change. And that practically never happens. You are right, when a relationship sinks to the level of violence, it's over. And if they decide to stay together, it is only a matter of time before he beats her again.<br>  <br>  Some women are also not very smart and like to hang around with the bad boys.
PoYFQ7Mxaa	What's average to you isn't average to everyone.  Appreciate that which you have been given.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	There is a great deal to be said about having stability and a sense of security in ones life. Living and working, doing the same things everyday, especially if one loves their job, gives one this. Many people enjoy a lifestyle such as this and others do not. Personal choice, which so far we all still have. Many of these people also have hobbies, talents and a social life. And no I am not like this right now, but I was before I got ill and couldn't work outside my home any longer & I have a very full life still. Remember it takes all kinds of people to make up this world and for this I am grateful.|`|KDCXd3B0aa	Because its stable and stress free, life doesn't always need excitment. yes, it's nice when your 16 to imagine an exciting life but you begin to realise things are boring and you want to reflect and think. also, people have kids remember, thats their excitment.|`|LpEzlBQCaa	I see things the same way and have a fear of ending up with an average lifestyel as i'm not ok with it. I realize it take sacrifice and a lot of work and time to climb the ladder and achieve things, but that's what I'm willing to do to make big money and have great accomplishments and more than a 9-5 shift. <br>  <br>  Some people are fine with it, but I'm not, I feel I have the ability, talent and potential to do big deals as I have seen myself do well in many things and if not, I always manage to improvise really well and find another way of doing something well or enhance that I struggled with at first or further improved.|`|v811KD7raa	a lot of people just dont have the talent or get-up-and-go to do anything else, and most people cant live the life of a criminal, so they choose 9-5.  a lot of people like stability in life too, and knowing youve got a stable job and a stable home is important to a lot of people|`|XtbjzpK7aa	i'd probably go mad, and they'd take me away and put me in a stay jacket if that happened to me. i just don't get how people do it.|`|ixOE0onnaa	yes it easy life for me.|`|Id4aSqrPaa	i know people whod love to work in a cubicle/ behind a desk/ etc. b/c its safe and predictable. i also know people who love challenges and new experiences. you need to know what your tolerance is and when you look into the future consider what consequences of your actions can affect your future life (you want kids: dont chose a job where it can affect your fertility) besides my friend that prefers to play it safe... her hubby has had cancer since he was 17 and is now 32 and she wants a safe life where they can eventually try for kids and get a house in the country. got to know your priorities.|`|2TavF36Daa	People are wired in many different ways.<br>  <br>  Some people are definitely not meant for a normal 9 to 5 job.

While there may be naysayers (some do not mind an average life--this is actually preferred for some), you are your own person. If you can't stand pizza, don't eat it! Needless to say, choose to be self employed, or, if that's not your cup of tea, get a high paying w-2 job and get an above average car, house, salary, etc. <br>  <br>  It is great that you know what you want at such a young age. I was not as fortunate. I allowed my family, friends, and society, to brainwash me into thinking that the "good life" was non existent, and I was doomed to mediocrity, as I am sure you've heard. I am now 22, and can honestly say, that I am happy with my life, not because of excitement, boredom, or average possessions. My life is happy because it is MY life. You can be the happiest man alive doing what you love doing, even if it does not make as much money. <br>  <br>  Like I said before, some people do not like taking risks, and prefer to live what you call an "average" lifestyle. This is most suitable for them. Others, such as you and I, cannot stand even the thought of being marginalized, or the exact same as everyone else. There is nothing wrong with either mindset. Different people need different lifestyles to make them happy, just as different people need different hobbies to enjoy. You are not alone in your dislike for the mainstream idea of life. <br>  <br>  Everyone will have their own opinions on what you should do, but you are the only one that knows your true desires.

AA12360662	red mousetraps = attention seeking, caution<br>  collapsing in snow = losing trust<br>  <br>  Your dream is about sleep over to friend's house and this dream is about your social life.  The red mousetraps in this case may symbolize some thing you want to be cautioned about.    There may be something that bothered you life that you feel you are caught in the middle.  On one hand you want others, but on the other hands, you may be afraid of being backfired.  The mousetrap may reflect some bad decision you may have made in reality.<br>  <br>  As far as the friends collapsing is concern, that is something you may fear about, things that may affect your friends because of your desire.  You may be playing safe in terms of dealing with your friends.  There may be some conflict in friendship and you may be feeling the need to be caution about not losing any friends or losing any trust from your friends.
RQxZSvFwaa	It certainly looks like it.|`|810NbDp9aa	No. <br>  because incest crosses moral lines. unlike homosexuality; people once thought it was unprincipaled and thus tabooed, but incest WILL always be wrong; unless people in the future are completely out of their minds.|`|3imLjQlHaa	No, incest has always been a social taboo. Homosexuality hasn't always been regarded as a mental illness.|`|AA10527991	I don't think so.  Too much of a social taboo to ever be fully accepted.  Not much wrong with it biologically as Don C mentioned.|`|RdO5DlCnaa	I don't think it will.  Incest, as we view it now, it gross, because the idea of having sex with someone who is related to you disgusts us.  Also, there is a genetic problem with it too.  You and your relatives share many common characteristics as a result of your common lineage.  If you were to reproduce, the baby would be very similar to the parents.  This isn't good for the human race, because it lessons diversity of the people.  Thirdly, many diseases have been found to be passed on during reproduction, meaning they are passed down via DNA.  There is a good chance 2 people in the same family might have the illness, or carry it as a recessive trait.  If they mate, then there is a chance that the 2 recessive traits will be passed on and the baby will have the genetic illness, and may pass it down to his or her children as well.  This, as one may expect, is also bad for the human race.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Damn silly question.|`|ZtGEyNJVaa	the answerer who stated that incest results in a weaker gene pool is wrong. it's common to "line breed" dogs, for example, to attempt to improve a blood line relative to confirmation (breeding the perfect spaniel for example. Inbreeding actually improves gene strains according to geneticists<br>  as to the question of incest between consenting adults it is not uncommon (varying degrees of separation such as fourth cousins and so on notwithstanding)<br>  incestuous marriages among royalty such as the Hapsburg's has been common in the past.<br>  it's conceivable that certain degrees of incest between consenting adults may become more common in the future.<br>  a side note here... selective breeding of humans is not uncommon and Nazi Germany wasn't the only society to consider (practise) it. it was not uncommon for people deemed inappropriate to "breed" to be "neutered" in Canada and the United States in the same period of the Holocaust and later under the mental health acts of various jurisdictions.
gcZSwvvUaa	wow, this is deep! it's very unusual to switch from confidence to being so shy. so i would guess that something happened u r not tell us. like what happened in school that made u so withdrawn? i would guess at first that u accepted your classmates very easily until you became aware they would not treat you like your family. and then you had a identity crisis. which u probably had to hide because there's no way ur family would understand it at all.<br>  <br>  my advice, try to make just a few friends, not a lot. and introduce them into your family also. it's better for you to have significant, real, friends. don't be tempted to be popular. choose your friends very carefully also. they will have great power over you in the coming years in high school. learn to read people and trust. and find your confidence again! there was a very good reason u received such love from ur family!|`|JxowGsKYaa	go back asleep|`|7935ef9a4a36c41bdd69d652ae386308aa	Relax.

Life's experiences change us for the better and sometimes for the worse.  I think what you are experiencing could just be part adolescence.  You need to just make sure that you do not bottle up or keep your emotions to yourself.  Find someone that you can open up too and share how you feel with.  It is normal to be shy around your age.  As you get older you should become less shy.  Just make sure you have someone you can talk to.  That is so important.  Best wishes to you.|`|uRqm4Bxcaa	Sounds like you're growing away from them.  Honestly once I joined the military this happened.  The first time I came back on leave everyone seemed different.<br>  <br>  I've since gotten out of the military and I'm back again.  What I now realize is that (unfortunately)  THEY are the same - I'M the one who changed.  Get used to this feeling, it comes with the territory with growing up.<br>  <br>  Just enjoy things while you can and bring up the good times every once in awhile just so you remind each other.
Id4aSqrPaa	i agree with you. if people really cared about you and your feelings they wouldn't pry unless you actually wanted to discuss it with them.<br>  <br>  other people are just nosy and fascinated with tragedy and love to hear the stories for their own amusement despite your pain.<br>  <br>  tell those people to go watch springer/maury for their drama fix|`|cyEi99Upaa	I always tell people that "it's personal, sorry," because it is YOUR personal life. Sometimes though, if they're your friend, they mean well and are concerned about you. Those who continue to ask are just curious. You can't help wanting to keep it to yourself, but they can't help WANTING to know what happened. You just have to tell them to understand your wishes, that it's private and that you're not ready to speak out about it and I'm sure they'll understand. You just have to tell them, (patiently and calmly), that it's bothersome when they continuously ask you what happened.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|NfsM7uCfaa	Only a terribly rude person would persist in questioning you after you have stated "I do not relive it because it was very painful". Unless you willingly offer an explanation, it it none of their business. Simply say, "Thank you for your concern but I don't care to share it." Many people find it necessary to know all the details of a tragic event, in spite of the fact that it is rude of them to ask.|`|YnCoiT5jaa	I understand. Time really does heal everything! When my parents died,I thought I would never get over it. I did though!|`|jlbMKE1vaa	i think when you forgive the situation and come to terms with it you free yourself from it. for example, say you hate a certain someonhe by hating someone or avoiding them you are wasting energy on them, rather then growing bigger then it. remember you are the boss of your feelings, and you can decide to learn from it and move on it or hide it.<br>  <br>  i understand you bnot wanting it to be brought up because lots of people are selfish and don't try or understand how you feel. but bringing it up isn't always a bad thing, good luck :)|`|cYtHoGaVaa	Yeah, I know what you mean. I just never mention things like that to people cause they always ask about it.|`|ECaqY67Iaa	you're right. it will definitely be hard to deal with it at first. so yes take some time to think about it by yourself for awhile. eventually talking about it WILL help heal yourself. therepy ussually does someone alot of good.

UMYda9Jaaa	I've had much the same problem. I'm very quiet and people will often comment which bothers me because I feel that they think I am afraid or shy when I'm not. I just don't know what to say to people I don't know well. <br>  <br>  Over the years I've come to realize that since a lot of people are extroverted and we're all trained in some degree to be talkative in social situations that quiet people make others feel uncomfortable. Extroverts particularly just don't understand and think that your silence may indicate dislike. <br>  <br>  I would imagine that you feel like crying because you are frustrated that you are often misunderstood. It hurts to be made to feel as though you should be different. <br>  <br>  Just remember, there's absolutely nothing wrong with being quiet. It indicates caution and wisdom when accompanied by a confident smile. If people start questioning your quietness, simply explain yourself. When I do this, most people respond very favorably and even ask questions because they haven't thought of "shy" people in that way before. For me, those conversations were a good way to break out of a stereotype without changing myself while nourishing aquaintances and gaining respect.|`|A9tx6v0yaa	I think they are saying this because they have been called a name or even quiet and want to see if how you act is how they acted, see if they are normal. Sometimes you just randomly get those you just want to cry mmoments, but if that isnt it, it could be something more serious. Talk to your gardian about it.|`|rffdGwB9aa	I'm really quiet too. But I don't think that people are trying too hurt you or anything. They probably just want you to talk more. If you get really effected by the comments people make, maybe you just believe what they are saying and you want to change it, but you can't.|`|IRFe95eLaa	you sound very shy and easily intimidated.  Maybe quiet isn't the word, more like meek.  There is no logical reason to be insulted any more than if someone said you are loud, outgoing, fun, reserved, etc.|`|YOxGVbUMaa	THEY ARE NOT TRYIN TO INSULT YOU DONT GET UPSET ABOUT IT THEY JUST TRYIN TO SEE WHY YOU DONT TALK 2 THEM!!!!

I dont think people are trying to make you feel bad.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	You have issues?|`|CxCigxZIaa	Honestly...IF you are wanting to burst out crying then YOU do have some issues that YOU only know about and NEED to deal with. I am CERTAIN it's not meant to be an insult at all. SOME people 'are' quieter than others..not a thing wrong with it...UNTIL you want to burst into tears. Soooooooooooo...what's the REAL reason you want to cry? There's more to this. Just asking...no pressure.|`|4c7QomPoaa	Welcome to the club.  I used to hear that all the time.  I was pretty much mute as a kid, barely talked to anyone until I was in my 20s and still quiet today.  The thing is, they aren't trying to hurt your feelings, you make them uncomfortable.  People don't know what to do with silence, and quiet people are an enigma.  The way I found to handle it was just to say "I'm a social scientist, I find watching people fascinating" or "hey the world needs an audience" or something to that effect, which usually had them scratching their heads and going "what?" but they finally stopped saying that.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	Yes. I don't know about you, but when people constantly tell me that i am too quiet, i feel bad, because i feel like something is wrong with me due to my inabilty to make conversations with everyone that i meet. It makes me wonder what i am doing wrong that makes me so different from everyone else. <br>  <br>  I want to change, but it doesn't seem to work that often. I have found that setting goals for myself works, because it gives me something work toward. I made myself talk to new people, so now i have new friends to wave at in the hallways. <br>  <br>  Try talking to new people that you feel may share your interests, and maybe they will become your close friends.|`|BtDGWKSNaa	that's how i am too.<br>  i don't like when people call me quiet because it feels like i'm not "normal".  i know this is really irrational but i can't help it.<br>  however, most people are not trying to make you feel bad.  they are simply commenting on your nature.  i've talked to some guys, and they think that shy girls are cute, so you never know.|`|0lefOvkSaa	its not a insult its a observation.Simply say,"I talk when I have some thing to say",smile and walk away.No one is trying to hurt you.
jvuuSRrzaa	Self-confidence does not necessarily imply 'self-belief' or a belief in one's ability to succeed. For instance, one may be inept at a particular sport or activity, but remain 'confident' in their demeanour, simply because they do not place a great deal of emphasis on the outcome of the activity. The key element to self-confidence is, therefore, an acceptance of the myriad consequences of a particular situation, be they good or bad. When one does not dwell on (negative) consequences, one can be more 'self-confident' because one is worrying far less about failure or (more accurately) the disapproval of others following potential failure. They are then more likely to focus on the actual situation, which means that enjoyment and success in that situation is also more probable. If there is any 'self-belief' component, it is simply a belief in one's ability to tolerate whatever outcome may arise; a certainty that one will cope irrespective of what happens. Belief in one's abilities to perform an activity comes through successful experience and may add to, or consolidate, a general sense of self-confidence|`|84bd3afe1dab0cb0a9e6ad36f3a6bcb6aa	It shows that you are who you are and aren't afraid of that.<br>  <br>  I know someone I will describe as lacking large amounts of confidence.  He is a push over, a coward, easily taken advantage of, weak, dependent, and almost useless.<br>  <br>  Now, take the complete opposite of those and tell me, why is confidence so important?<br>  <br>  You're right, you don't have to be a chatter box.  However, when someone asks you something, do you tell them the answer or say what you think they want to hear? Do you say "maybe" or "I don't know?"  These are frustrating answers to hear.<br>  <br>  Imagine if 30 people all said "maybe." What got resolved?  Nothing.|`|AwPD2Evbaa	basically people with no confidence usually have major issues about their looks and feelings that is why confidence is so important but when people are quiet it can be lack in confidence it can be that they're shy or they can just be naturally quiet, people telling you that you need to boost your confidence because you don't talk much don't know quite what confidence is.|`|PgxU0gBeaa	I say it means being happy with being you, no matter who you are.  There is a huge difference  being confident and being a snob.  And confidence is important b/c most ppl can't stand whiny, jealous ppl who complain all the time.|`|n2y17YsOaa	It just shows everyone you're comfortable in your own shoes. You don't have to say a word to be confident.|`|kYtZqeIaaa	Confidence these days is taken in the wrong ways. People think that confidence means outgoing or wild. They think that because you can act that way, that you are confident about yourself. That is a load of bs. Confidence is when you feel happy and comfotable with yourself both visually and mentally. <br>  <br>  Secondly, confidence (real confidence) is extremely important. Without confidence, people can really break down. They can become jerks and freaks. They can look down upon themselves and never get a job, or a home, or a spouse. Sometimes when it has to do with body, they become anorexic or bullimic and hurt their bodies. Other times people kill themselves. Without confidence, it can really hurt you. <br>  <br>  But you have to really be confident. Part of being confident is knowing that you are confident. It doesn't matter what people say is the number one motto for being confident. <br>  <br>  don't get confused between the people who want to turn something so beautiful into a joke, because confidence is not a joke|`|1vzAvmEbaa	What does it mean to be confident? Is it being arrogant and conceited in oneself? Or is it being self-assured in oneself? It is your own choice to decide which point it is. I personally believe that it is not overrated and it helps yourself become more of a happy, nice, and generous person and assuringly does not mean that you are loud and arrogant.<br>  <br>  Being confident certainly does not mean that you are like those other people that you have met in the world. In fact, I do not believe that is true confidence. True confidence is someone who cares about people and is nice to everyone that they have met. The people that you have met in your life are insecure in themselves and you should not even spend your time thinking about them. When they are not being conceited, and arrogant, deep down, they are less confident than you are. <br>  <br>  People today say I lack confidence because I am not as loud and as talkative as they are. It definitely does not mean that I am lacking confidence, and it does not mean you are either.  <br>  <br>  To wrap it all up, confidence is just being happy with yourself, to care about people, and to love yourself the way you are.  (:
xuwJ6Vn3aa	Probably because it's winter but I admit i dont do enough in the winter. In the summer im out 24/7 doing the things I enjoy. If your like this year-round, try to walk to and from school. This will help you enjoy the weather, and nice light excerisise like this will make you crave more. Also, diet is another key factor. If you eat unhealthy, and too much then you will end up with 0 energy, and end up feeling gross. Try to eat fruit and  like honey nut cheerios or somethingin the morning, and for lunch try a sooup or sandwhich or soemthing healthy like that and for dinner try making something non greasy, and home cooked. Also, planning things with your friends to do outdoor activities is a great way to get motivated. If the day comes and you really don't feel like going out for a bike ride, or for a swim then you'll be less likely to not go because you'll be with your friends and you don't want to cancel on them. If your in your early teens your going through puberty and this often causes people to be lazy, and tired since your growing more rapidly in this area of your life. Personally, in the summer or on a nice day i cant stand to stay inside because enjoying the nice weather, and having fun with your friends while doing physical activity is so much funner then sitting on the computer all day, and doing physical activity regularily helps keep you engergized! GOOD LUCK XOX <3|`|AZM4H5vUaa	just do it when you're feeling the most lazy.<br>  after and during the run you'll probably think to yourself "damn why havn't i been doing this all along?" :P<br>  <br>  i know what you mean though, i have these days too.

bdttDnlwaa	Some people cheat during examinations because, I agree, the right motivations are not truly there.<br>  <br>  So the Student employs his or her intelligence, (one must be smart to cheat well and not to get caught), in the skills it takes to by-pass the Rules, instead than in the skills it takes to learn a Subject assiduously in order to be at ease during the examination.<br>  <br>  And again, because the right motivations are not there, the object of the cheat is immediate reward, (pouf! I have passed this exam), instead of long term reward, (I know my Subject very well because I have studied it thoroughly. This will help me in all my future projects and ambitions).<br>  <br>  Take care.<br>  <br>  PS : by the way, even if a Student resents a Subject so much as to resort to cheating, the skills of learning and learning well, develop a human being in a very rewarding way.

uDUk0SCEaa	OK, number one. Don't lose your head.<br>  <br>  I know it feels like this is a world-changing event for you, but I assure you that it is not.<br>  <br>  In fact, you will likely have forgotten this guy within a few months, and I can almost guarantee that you will have forgotten him within the next 10 years.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your heart is being tugged by this dude (who isn't playing fair), but you still understand that your friendship with this girl is more valuable. I'd say that you are probably correct. <br>  <br>  Regarding the guy. If he can't keep his words straight from one place to another, he's not worth half a pile of rat dung. So you wouldn't want to lose anything over him.<br>  <br>  Tell him to beat it so he can 'beat it' until he learns how to be a real man.<br>  <br>  If you are in a relationship, evaluate it. If there is a good reason to stay in it, then STICK BY YOUR MAN. Otherwise, the fact that your eye is 'roving' like this indicates that you have loyalty and fidelity issues. Do yourself and the guy a favor and break it off until you have more maturity or a more clear 'feeling' towards a specific person.<br>  <br>  After that, try to put a little bit of thought into your life in general. It sounds like you are wasting a lot of time mucking about with short-term relationships that just get you confused, upset and distracted.<br>  <br>  Consider going 3-6 months 'completely single' and 'out of the market' and just focus on enjoying your youth, making the best of your real friendships and maybe learning a thing or two while you are at school.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you risk fast-tracking your life to being a 1X year old pregnant single mom with incomplete high school, trying desperately to get a minimum wage job at wal-mart because that's the classiest job where they even let you in the door.

AlJrVK8Gaa	A lot of this depends on how old you are and how far you are from retirement.  <br>  <br>  The older you get and the closer you are to retirement dictates how conservative you should be.  As you get older, you should be dialing back your risk.  The reason is that when you are young, you can afford to take losses because you probably don't have a lot of money and you have plenty of time to work to make up for losses.  However, when you are only a few year from retirement, you have accumulated your life's savings and if you take significant losses, you will have to push back you retirement date.  If you are under 30, you should have 20% in low risk securities and 80% in stocks.  Under 40, should have 50-50, and under fifty should be 80% low risk and 20% stocks.<br>  <br>  Today's markets are scary, but this is a good time to be buying in.  There are really good companies out there whose stock is lower than it should be, and you can buy them cheap.  Look at all of the big investors, like Warren Buffet or Carl Ichan, they are like kids in a candy shop.  But you need to know what you are buying, before you make a move.  Do plenty of research and realize that these are long-term investments.  They will not go up over night, but when the market comes back in the distant future, they should come back strong.  <br>  <br>  In times like this, I would keep at least 50% in low-risk securities like bonds or high yield savings accounts or CD's, depending on your age.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would take care of my money and tend to be on the conservative side.  However, since I don't know your full story, I suggest that you consult with a licensed financial adviser who can give you more concise and tailored solutions.  Trust me, the fee that they charge is nothing compared to the losses you could take.<br>  <br>  Also, check with your employer, most companies offer their employees discounted or free consultations with financial advisers from the company that manages your 401(k). <br>  <br>  Cheers|`|oNg8zGi8aa	If you still have money and kept loosing it then take all of it and buy gold and silver on hand , Buy food , guns , ammo and barter goods . The black hole o h-ll is coming .|`|AcgDcQG0aa	It might take quite a few years for the stock market to get back to its previous level.  But sooner or later it probably will get back there.  And if you keep investing continuously.  Then you'll end up investing a lot of your money when the stock market is low.  Which will result in good profits, when the stock market eventually goes back up.<br>  <br>  But to be sure that you will benefit from a stock market turn-around, you should invest in funds that are linked to the major stock market indexes, such as the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100.<br>  <br>  Mutual funds aren't normally tied to any index.  But Exchange Traded Funds such as DIA, SPY, and QQQQ are tied to the above indexes.   And it might be a good idea for you to move your money to these index funds.  <br>  <br>  But to invest in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), you need to open a brokerage account.  Because shares of these ETFs are bought and sold in the stock market just like shares of companies are.

Id4aSqrPaa	i dont think its sex addiction. usually that means a need to feel something/ to fill a void of emotion/feeling/attention/etc. but with multiple partners and at all times of the day, and it affects your daily functioning (you sneak away from work/school, cant get errands/chores done, etc.) <br>  <br>  at least its just one partner. and if you dont have any emotional ties or want anything more from the relationship then there is no reason to not to have a sex buddy. a lot of ppl do :)|`|IRiSE0qlaa	are you a girl or guy?|`|BtDGWKSNaa	get a lover or something if you really want to stop.<br>  maybe you should just stop feeling bad about it.  i mean, it's just sex.  it's not like you murdered a child.<br>  if you're enjoying it, and your frequent sex partner is as well, then why stop?  you both are using each other..so it's fine, in my opinion.|`|84bd3afe1dab0cb0a9e6ad36f3a6bcb6aa	I will tell you that you are engaging in a selfish act of sex.  You enjoy it because you find personal pleasure in it.<br>  <br>  Love making is unselfish.  The reason you feel guilty is because, you too, are using the other person for your own gratification.<br>  <br>  If you were making love, you wouldn't give a hoot if you "got off" but you'd love that the other person "get off."<br>  <br>  You have an addiction like any other addiction.  Why not ask yourself "Why do I enjoy sex? What is it, specifically, that I enjoy? Is it the other person? Is it the feeling I get? How can I better share this experience with someone?"<br>  <br>  You give into your urges.  You need a hobby, for one - sex and relationships are not hobbies.  Do you not have anything else to do?<br>  <br>  Any 12 step program will help, this is merely an addiction and addictions can be beat.|`|KOX2wFWwaa	wow i cud have asked the same question you just asked lol i have had this problem for a while too and what i can say to you is try doing something that can help you release energy in the day liek working out. if not that you have to totally cut the person off completely like no contact at alll if that doesn't help when the urges comes on thing of really bad things like something disgusting  or just masturbate and release the tension|`|8DYwsHlPaa	i dont think your addicted <br>  it's just that good
rG5VxxNKaa	When you increase taxes to both the corporations and individuals; you take away their disposable income (less money for them to spend). The result is stagflation or and a reduction in GDP as total demand has gone down because of lack of purchasing power on the part of those being taxed.  Governments only act as a medium to redistribute income and take a cut out to pay the bureaucrats for their efforts in redistribution.  Governments are not your friend but they are necessary for establishing an army for protection of the public.|`|6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	Everyone's income is the result of someone spending for consumption or investment, and when the government increases taxes they reduce private spending, Since they used the money to reduce the deficit not to increase government spending  the effect was to decrease the total spending in the economy and therefore the total income. If the economy had been booming it would only slowed it down, but since the economy was growing slowly the reduction caused the economy to shrink. There are also many other factors that influence growth in an economy that trades and invests in other countries like Japan does|`|AcgDcQG0aa	The third quarter of 1997 was the time of the Asian Financial Crisis.  Stock markets plunged everywhere, including in Japan and in USA.  And many people in countries such as Japan cut back on their spending.  Because they feared that recession was coming.<br>  <br>  This crisis probably had a lot more to do with the Japanese recession in 1997, than tax changes.

Id4aSqrPaa	literal means taking into context with no hidden meaning *sarcasm, metaphors, etc.* but think of it this way... you'd make a great career in science/medicine. that is usually where the best literal minds work. <br>  <br>  watch Bones on fox on Thursdays... Dr. Brennan is very literal... shes smart but doesn't get social slangs/ jokes/ sarcasm/ etc. its quite funny|`|PGPTbMJVaa	It's not a bad thing but it could be something you would want to change.  Which is to say that, in social situations, being literal would not help...it may be held as ridicule.  Fortunately the way we interpret the spoken word is flexible.  This friend may have said it because, for example, you weren't flirty, or coy, like that, but instead you felt compelled to talk about your shyness.  I'm the same way, actually, so when I'm on the phone, and I'm nervous or shy, right, I listen and I'm cautious about answering, sometimes choosing to stay silent--which, believe it or not has a marvelous effect.  People in general are aware the phone is not a 'natural' thing, but an amplifier that can make another person hear what you say from miles away.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Depends, but your friend probably meant it as down-to-earth and honest unless he has an extensive vocabulary. But ask him what he means exactly, for insight.  I myself would take it as an insult, since I see, hear and read beyond what is in front of me as part of a creative process, depending on context. When it comes to figures of speech or  non-religious profanity. I always see it in the literal sense of the word. <br>  <br>  Don't worry.<br>  <br>  Literal-minded: down-to-earth, prosaic, factual, matter-of-fact or unimaginative, colorless, commonplace, tedious, boring, dull, uninspiring.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	When I hear that someone is too literal, it means that the person can't read between the lines.  That person takes everything at face value and often doesn't get jokes, sarcasm or irony.  All is taken literally.  This is usually NOT a compliment, but not necessarily an insult either.  He might just be trying to tell you something here.|`|AwPD2Evbaa	Literal means you say what you mean, say if you take something literally "hold this for a sec" and then they count to 1 and drop what there holding they took that literally.|`|twHXC9Draa	straight to it and you never hold your thoughts back in that little tiny head of yours! lol im sooooooooooo just kidding about the little head thing or am i?|`|3U7LTpfvaa	You're straight forward. Not always a bad thing.
sIX1nhCFaa	God gaves us emotions to express how we feel, otherwise how would people know?|`|H01MwmkVaa	That is a really good question!  I would say it's because God has emotions and we were made in his image for a relationship with him and others.  Without emotions, we would never experience happiness, love, or compassion.  We would be like robots going about jobs and we'd have no interest in others.  Just my own thoughts.

H01MwmkVaa	People in long-term romantic relationships go through a loss of romantic feelings as time goes on.  It's because when you really know someone, you find out that they're not perfect and there are differences that cause you to lose that initial idealized view of that person.  It doesn't mean you don't care, but love isn't just about feelings.  It requires an unselfish commitment to others.  Romantic feelings will come and go in every relationship.  Try to see this person in a more realistic way and your feelings will disappear.|`|onkUcy19aa	Do you remember the saying, "I am never upset for the reason I think?"<br>  Don't be rushed by your feelings which you believe could be romantic or otherwise. However, be true to yourself. If you really want to have a relationship with the guy, why not show it in the most subtle way?Perhaps, he could respond! Surely, he is not a statue not to notice your feelings! <br>  <br>  But if you want to stop it, then keep on affirming these words, "I can elect to change all thoughts that hurt." Yes, indeed, you could elect all thoughts that are hurting you now. You are what you think! Remove all your maudlin notions when the guy does not show any reciprocity or is so stupid not to notice it. Move on.... He is not worth your time. Good luck to you and God bless.|`|eVLUIvDjaa	all it takes is time. if you stay away from him long enough, feelings will go away. same thing happened to me. i know its so hard to stay away from someone you have feelings for, but you gotta do it.<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|vEXE2XE7aa	shoot yourself in the foot.i promise you'll forget your own name,let alone his
rD5HyZyeaa	I see what you are saying. In a sense, addressing women's issues under a separate name (feminism) and the involvement it draws from others is kind of like being chaperoned in Western culture. To a certain extent I think this is true - women are again singled out. I see the chaperoning that takes place in Islamic cultures (I also know as I was engaged to a Turk and spent time in Turkey) as expectations of what women cannot do by the strict law of God and society, whereas the "chaperoning" by feminism as something which puts before women what they can do. I haven't seen feminism as something that tells women that they can't (italicized) experience the traditional roles of women, but more like something that says "here are things you can (italicized) do." I think of feminism more in terms of concepts or ideas, an open door to debate, which is sometimes hard to find here. Feminism is not as supreme as God. You can't argue with God or God's word. But you can argue with feminism.<br>  <br>  It kinda makes a person wonder why women would need any sort of special treatment. Unfortunately, I do believe most of the world as we know and experience it today has been set and shaped by men - it's basically a man's world (look at the English language, for example. "Woman" cannot be a word without "man," which in itself implies male. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam build off the idea that man is made in God's image, man came first, woman is the first sinner, women brought pain and despair onto all of us, etc.) and now that we've reached a point where we can recognize it, many women (and men) would like to neutralize the masculine overtones and advantages inherent in almost everything. Once a culture defines something in a certain way, it is very difficult to change it. We can see how something like this happens by looking at American culture today. When people overseas hear the word "American," what kind of person do they imagine? More than likely, they imagine a white male. Now, living in America, I know there are white males here, but I also know that they are females along with people of different colors. Now start putting the word American with other words - American food, American history, American music. What comes to mind? If your brain had been conditioned like mine, the first thing you might think of are hot dogs/hamburgers, the founding fathers and constitution, and country music. If I think about it more, of course I know there are more foods worth noting in America, such as creole food from the south or philly cheesesteak sandwiches, and American history includes the natives who lived here before us, not to mention the thousands upon thousands of slaves who built the wealth of this country with their blood and sweat, and for music we have jazz, the blues, etc. The point I'm trying to make is that America, as young as it is, has already been defined in a certain way - and even though the way it was originally defined is not at all inclusive to what we know America to be today - we still think of and act as if America is defined in those original terms. Returning to gender and culture, everything has been defined in terms of "man" for so long that I suppose something like feminism is necessary to chaperone women out of the default mindset.<br>  <br>  This is already too long - but I like what you wrote about keeping the middle class enslaved. That is so true. Slavery still exists in the US today, it's just that it's legal now. I disagree that there is much concern for the vote of the poor. Although the poorest people are the ones receiving the benefits, the poorest people are the least likely population to vote. Offers to help the poor is just one of the many cards played to get votes from the sympathetic/empathetic.|`|ROdHsYVAaa	Ah ignorance is bliss.<br>  <br>  In countries that are hardcore Islamic, women are not legally or morally allowed to appear in public without a husband or male relative.  They usually have to cover their faces as well.<br>  <br>  In the US, no escort is required.  I am in no need of governmental or idealogical "support" or chaperonage... Any woman with 1/3 of a brain is not either.  There is no law prohibiting me from appearing in public without a male relative. <br>  <br>  Leaving Alabama is definatly advised....|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Pssh, nobody ever told me I needed to be "chaperoned" by feminism. Believing in something is rarely, if ever, the same as requiring it. You act as if people who associate with a doctrine are incapable of independent thought.|`|T6xd0OxWaa	They are required by law.<br>  While here they encourage it.|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	If YOU are being "chaperoned" (whatever that means) by the government, and feel like you need that, fine, but I would ask you HOW exactly you're "chaperoned" by the US government, or by "feminism."<br>  <br>  I'm not "Chaperoned" by the government, or by "feminists." <br>  <br>  There IS no answer to your question, because it's based on the incorrect notion that any sort of "chaperoning" similar to your comparison exists. It does not.|`|I15Wjrcmaa	I'm not sure why you feel that western women have to be chaperoned by feminism and the government. Perhaps you need to clarify that because I don't see that happening at all.<br>  <br>  I don't know much about Muslim chaperoning because I'm Christian and American. The Western women I've seen are about as free as it gets. Lots of women choose to educate themselves and take on professional jobs without giving a rip about having ANYONE chaperone them.  Other women...the ones I might describe as "being chaperoned"...are those that decide that the only way for them to exist is to have several children out of wedlock and ask the government to support them indefinitely.  Radical feminists would consider depeneding on a bunch of (mostly) men to take care of them to be terrible. Radical feminists would prefer for those women to have abortions too, so they won't be "chaperoned." <br>  <br>  Again, maybe I just don't understand the question as well as I should.  The only western women I see being chaperoned against their will are teenagers that are going to some social event like a prom.  Personally, I love to be chaperoned by a man who treats me like a lady. In no way does it take away my independence though.|`|41b54654c92b228c57d74d269099fd9baa	That really is a total slap in the face to many of the women in Islamic Countries who have it 50 times harder than you ever will. <br>  <br>  I'm no feminist but you need to step down from that high horse.|`|G50ucmllaa	So tell me how feminisim and the government CURRENTLY treat me different than my date....then apply this to a Muslim woman.|`|1wIek546aa	people who reject feminism aren't stoned.|`|G1kdupY3aa	Would you just look at that!  Wendy isn't being chaperoned either.  Its INCREDIBLE isn't it?  What are the chances?  Two women who know nothing about eachother have NO CHAPERONES in common!  Its like winning the lottery!<br>  **************************************...<br>  What are you talking about?<br>  <br>  Nobody "chaperones" me or anybody else I know. <br>  Maybe you are being chaperoned because you are "special needs"? <br>  <br>  The government in the USA doesn't mollycoddle anybody - in fact, its quite the reverse. People are left to become very desperate and they often end up having to resort to crime, they don't even have universal health care for the people over there.  The poor, the disabled, the eldery are left to live in squalor, suffer and die and - nobody gives a shyte because nobody wants to pay taxes.  Its all "me me me..".<br>  <br>  *Yes, I lived in Washington DC and found the desperation there everywhere BUT the NW  shocking.  Parts of DC - like the USA in general - look like an impoverished developing country (and I've seen a few of those too).   There was even some kook with a gun running around my old neighbourhood (close to the American University).  Nowhere is safe even in the nation's capital.<br>   <br>  Nevermind the conspiracy theories, they bore me.<br>  There is nothing "ironic" (or even remotely humorous) about poverty, desperation and hopelessness.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	How exactly are Western women "chaperoned"?<br>  <br>  The feminist movement told us we were equal to men. That's obviously not chaperoning.<br>  <br>  The law punishes people that ILLEGALLY attack us. So if you call prosecuting rapists, harassers, abusers, and stalkers as "chaperoning", they you obviously think that the entire government shouldn't do crap for its citizens when another has wronged them. Anarchy is awesome! Or, you're just of the opinion that women are subhuman and ought not be protected by the legal system.<br>  <br>  I really can't tell if your opinion here is just awe-inspiringly ignorant or plain sexist. If you really want to knock one out of the park here, you could throw in some quip about rape victims deserving it.|`|wkjncmHTaa	Uh, well I can go about my day to day life without restriction for a start. I've lived in India where my movements were restricted and there's a pretty big difference. And that was in a *relatively* permissive predominantly Hindu culture. Exactly how am I chaperoned by the government?? Please do explain. Honestly Aycora, you do make the occasional good point but most of what you say is complete nonsense.
HZKsNwbeaa	Its very healthy, Some people like to be alone, while some want to be around people. We are all different as individuals and have our own preferences, don't let anyone tell you differently.|`|CEKZsoFRaa	No, only sexual relationships should be sworn off, for a while.|`|E70A7aqcaa	Swearing off relationships, or someone deciding they want to be alone their whole life is a very typical, and, in an interesting way, a very healthy thing for people.  Usually those "swearings" or "decisions" come immediately after some breakup / divorce or other "trauma" in a relationship, and since these "swearings off" or "decisions" never last long anyway, it's usually the only tool the individual  has in their arsenal of managing relationships, or their pain from a difficult spot in one, and is necessary for them to do what healthier people do, which is to simply, as "diamond p" says, stay away from sexual or otherwise heavily intimate relationships, or, as "giraffes . . ." says, stay single for a few months.  It's whatever tool one needs to use to "take a break" in relationships because of some "trauma" they may have experienced in the one they were in at that time.  But, as I pointed out earlier, the "swearings" never hold for long, so, they'll never really be alone their whole life.  They're just reacting to hurt.  The only real problem with all that is that often they never learn anything from the problems they just experienced, and so they face them again in the next relationship, or the one after that, since they have what we call in the mental health profession, "serial relationships"or "serial monogamy". God Bless you.|`|Id4aSqrPaa	maybe for the moment someone who's hurt bad enough, loses faith in people, etc. cant find good in people anymore and just needs that time alone. eventually someone will come into their lives to change those beliefs. don't force it and demean their beliefs. if they need that time and cant see good right now then let them figure it out on their own. it beats being in failed relationship after failed relationship and settling on anyone whod give them attention.|`|F5ptObE8aa	their whole life yes.<br>  for a couple months no.

GRzAxgfdaa	Make your move, but its tricky business. It doesn't need to be romantic, but just have a good time after you take her out to eat, lower her stress level and just relax, and if it comes to you to make a move, naturally do it.

ZlWhnobDaa	did she recently lose someone? like a family member or a friend? it may be her head telling her that she misses that person and needs that person. i dont know about the dream catcher. i personally believe they dont work.|`|uXsqZLoiaa	probably cuz of thee dream catcher.|`|AA12073051	possibly<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A nightmare is a dream which causes a strong unpleasant emotional response from the sleeper, typically fear or horror, being in situations of extreme danger, or the sensations of pain, bad events, falling, drowning or death. Such dreams can be related to physical causes such as a high fever, turned faced down on a pillow during sleep (most often in the case of drowning nightmares), or psychological ones such as psychological trauma or stress in the sleeper's life, or can have no apparent cause. If a person has experienced a psychologically traumatic situation in life—for example, a person who may have been captured and tortured—the experience may come back to haunt them in their nightmares. Sleepers may waken in a state of distress and be unable to get back to sleep for some time. Eating before bed, which triggers an increase in the body's metabolism and brain activity, is another potential stimulus for nightmares[1].<br>  Occasional nightmares are commonplace, but recurrent nightmares can interfere with sleep and may cause people to seek medical help. A recently proposed treatment consists of imagery rehearsal. This approach appears to reduce the effects of nightmares and other symptoms in acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.<br>  Practitioners of lucid dreaming claim that it can help conquer nightmares of this type, rather than of the traditional type|`|w7XNcmihaa	Woah, that may be it. Tell her to put the dream catcher back up, and wait a week. If her dreams are good again then thay may be the problem.|`|m3Wza3xraa	oh wow intense!!! maybe sometimes dreams dont mean anything or sometimes its just something thats being going on in your life and your subconsius just put suspense and drama to it!!|`|rNE7XAmgaa	There's probably something bothering her, and she feels unsafe.<br>  <br>  A dream reflects what you're mind is thinking.|`|SoSy4SwXaa	sounds like a weird poem or somthin|`|ELUvm4Liaa	If you believe that dream catchers work, then it could have a psychological affect on her because it's not there, and she has a bad dream.   But I don't believe the dream catcher actually catches bad dreams.|`|Yu3jLy9vaa	what is this about... some nightmare... the person needs to take some sleeping pills and go fast asleep!!|`|e8EQviEXaa	Dreams are very interesting. it is like the puzzle pieces are being put together in your head. once in a rare while you end up with really strange dreams. these are called "Coincidences" or in other words, it is possible to continue a dream you had before if you remember it that well and think about it right before you "Zonk Out". I had a dream about my cat, then next year i had another one, and a year after, another...all on the same day of the year. strange? maybe but what do you expect. just calm down when you wake up. i have woken up crying before, not pleasant because i saw something disturbing...|`|kVWC0fC8aa	God is saying come to me. "Jeni", your friend, keeps slipping away. God is saying, "Jeni. Come to Me. You are fading away. Call to Me Jeni, and I will answer." A dream catcher isn't even real. It's all myth. God has His hand there, Jeni just needs to "grab" it. The hole resembles her falling again after again, and the cliff resembles her at her life. Jump and fall, or jump and be caught.<br>  <br>  God will catch Jeni, she just needs to take the leap and not keep on hanging onto fate.

The same applies to men too. You'll never have any idea of how much it hurts.<br>  <br>  There are two places for men no amount of muscles or exercise can make immune from pain: the eyes and the genitals.<br>  <br>  And I don't claim to be SO much stronger than women, so that nullifies your generalized first statement right there.<br>  <br>  You're probably the type of feminist who believes men can be treated cruelly and put in misery because they are men. It isn't any less sexist than the belief that women can be treated as baby machines because they are women. <br>  <br>  You think we're not supposed to feel pain when kicked there? Then don't you dare protest when men say women aren't supposed to feel pain during childbirth.|`|tPrXVjX7aa	Allthough I'd like to think that you can't generalize like that, it is of course ridiculous and the drama that comes with it is not much unlike the drama that is attributed usually to females (especially in sports, e.g. soccer, if you have ever seen that, it's ludicrous!).  <br>  <br>  However, strong has very little to do with the body's perception of pain.  It is true that men are generally stronger, because they have more muscle mass, are generally larger etc..  It is also true (up to a certain point) that men are less pain sensitive due to a 'thicker' skin.<br>  <br>  However, pain is subjective and can be influenced by learned behaviour, social and societal norms, but also by an increase of the building of neural pathways due to high stimulus in younger years (especially during infancy and early childhood). <br>  <br>  All that said, however; have you ever noticed that nobody audibly or visibly adversely reacts then there is a rape scene or other violence against women, including rough sexual scenes?.  In crowded movie theaters there are even almost always a few women who, strange enough, 'grasp' and exclaim some painful remarks to the sight of males 'just' being externally assaulted in the groin area? <br>  <br>  I'm not saying that an assault into a males groin is pleasant, but it is certainly not to be compared to anything to the afore mentioned or any pornographic depictions which incidentily many males use to stimulate and arouse themselves!  <br>  <br>  There are even a few comments here to your question comparing a female being 'kicked' in her vulva etc. which is exactly my point in re: of pornography!  The guys that are so sensitive to being kicked in their nuts are probably mostly the same who do not object enjoying a porno that is filmed using drug addicts and homosexuals (because no other sober, normal female would want to be subjected to that).  <br>  <br>  Again, accordingly "male pain is unimaginable".  But just google the subject of "male and female circumcision", for instance.  It absolutely cannot to be compared; The procedure that females are subjected to, rather amounts to castration and complete amputation and is nothing as close to the male circumcision (which in the majority is performed under anesthesia anyway).  Do you hear any real outcries and attempts to stop that anywhere around the globe?  Can you imagine what kind of a subject that would be if millions of males around the globe were subjected to genital mutilation, castration and amputation?  Can you imagine how much pornography there still would be around if the objects were pre-dominantly males and the consumers of these not males?<br>  <br>  These kind of things set the stage and re-enforce socially accepted 'norms'.  The standard and norm of definitions need to be set to the value they represent, not by the louder and more dramatic group that pronounces it.|`|jf1f7vNxaa	You know how it is.<br>  <br>  It's like the way it is with women - the lightest smack right across her F__in' mouth and they roll around on the ground crying.|`|G50ucmllaa	Really?

That is why they have seperate sporting events for women, because they cannot compete against men successfully.<br>  <br>  The reason a man rolls around crying when they get bashed in the groin is that it is extremely painful.  Being stronger doesn't mean you can't feel pain.|`|cCKASg4Waa	Because that's a fragile, soft, sensitive area. Has nothing to do with overall strength. Women for example, are sensitive in the breasts. And getting hit there would bring great pain. A man isn't nearly as sensitive in that same area.<br>  <br>  I don't know if you're trolling or not, but if you're honestly basing how "serious" you take someone based on their reaction to getting hit in the groin; that's pretty sad.|`|RKLce4ltaa	I don't GAS whether you take me seriously.

Theoretically at least, it gives him a sense of control of her sexual behavior, and security that any child she conceives will be his.<br>  <br>  Decisions to be celibate are often rooted in religious belief.  Religion is a "glue" that holds social societies together.  Adherence to its rules can give people a sense of social security.<br>  <br>  By encouraging or pressuring others to be celibate, we are maximizing our own reproductive output relative to them.<br>  <br>  Most anthropologists agree that we are by nature a monogamous species, so to an extent its natural to want to reserve sex for that "special someone".|`|aGORltJPaa	Motivations:<br>  <br>  Religious beliefs, Clerical celibacy, sannyasa. <br>  <br>  To focus energies on other matters, like one's career or social issues, sublimation. <br>  <br>  To cultivate a relationship according to an ideal of chastity. <br>  <br>  A distaste or lack of appetite for sex, asexuality or antisexualism. <br>  <br>  An inability to form a sexual relationship, involuntary celibacy. <br>  <br>  Perceived benefit of alteration of physiological factors, hormonal changes. <br>  <br>  As an attempt to gain a sense of self and independence from others. <br>  <br>  Medical limitations, medical celibacy. <br>  <br>  Avoiding risk of venereal disease. <br>  <br>  Avoiding being emotionally hurt. <br>  <br>  As a means of birth control. <br>  <br>  Avoiding prosecution, for homosexual relations under sodomy laws. <br>  <br>  Punishment <br>  <br>  Erectile dysfunction|`|K2ecmzInaa	None.|`|4WvdDCHSaa	I'm a slow runner!|`|VNfWVGagaa	all i can think of is.. religion, personal motivation or maybe a phobia or something to do with mental health..?|`|lbrCHEHUaa	Aids, which I do not have.|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	I'm a guy.

ab3efd718c864b03946535d2dc7dfbfbaa	Manufacturing and call centers have been sent offshore.  The real problem is that although the service and cost of manufacturing is less offshore, by sending the work offshore and thus reducing the domestic workforce money (disposable income) is also disappearing, which in turn mean less consumers to purchase the product which is now being manufactured offshore.  Because, people earning $1 a day can not afford the products they are manufacturing and people who are no longer working can also not afford the same product as they don't have the income.

One healthy thing you can do is to not react to the manipulation and not permit yourself to be manipulated.  That part is totally under your control.

So much for that theory.<br>  There is no time limit. it depends on the individual and what kind of shape they are in when they start smoking, what sort of diet and what type of active or non active lifestyle they live. Genetics play a huge role also as well as environmental things. A boxer who is a heavy smoker probably won't live as long as a runner who smokes and an office worker might live a long life as a smoker. my dad worked in offices all his life and wasn't particularly active, but was in great shape as a young man. I was in great shape as a young man and now I'm 50, been smoking since 15 and i sell scrap metal for a living so i probably work harder than most people. I could die tomorrow and for that matter I might not even finish this posts, but you just never kno.......arrrghhhhh. (I died just in time to click the submit button.)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Wow..a miracle just happened. God almighty resurrected me so i could write more. Whaddaya know?<br>  Death and cigarette smoking is sort of irrelevant. There really is no down side to dying. Your bills are all paid on the spot, your bad hair cut self heals itself on the spot, suddenly your bad fitting shoes fit perfectly, no more bologna sandwiches, no more sarcastic remarks from other YA'ers.. I mean, what's the down side to dying? None. The living have all the problems with it. The living, me, you and everyone else sits around morning, but have you ever seen a dead person at a funeral crying and weeping?<br>  So light up, enjoy life and stop worrying if your next cigarette is going to bump you off 5 minutes early. You do get to die eventually whether you smoke or not, go bungee jumping without a cord, sky dive into Berlin in 1943, stick your head in a microwave oven or if you live your entire life in a convent.

Nldx247Yaa	I know this sounds crazy, especially with your perfectionism, but i think you should finish  your project, whether or not you think it's perfect for you... it does involve self-esteem, you're right in that aspect, but you should get feedback from other people on your art. I know for me, I feel a lot better when other people have seen what I've done, even if it isn't finished yet. I feel the same way, like when i'm drawing or painting, i'll be totally into my sketch and idea for the piece and I have all this motivation to start it, but once I get towards the middle, I lose that spark I had in the beginning and I just kinda slack off or not finish...lately, when that happens, I ask ppl to look at my work, just to have an outside opinion... usually whether they give constructive criticism or praise, I have enough drive to finish whatever I'm doing. And most of the time, they come up to me after a while to see the progress of my work. <br>  As for the mentality that your work just isn't good enough, I'd have to say that it's a sickness of all perfectionists out there. You can't really solve that, especially since you have superhuman focusing powers.

2RAvyY0naa	I believe that in societies governed/controlled by men are not ideal for women, because from young we are socialized to do 2 main things throughout life:<br>  1- Base our self esteem on what the opposite sex thinks about us. <br>  (How to view virgins and non-virgins play a big role here. It hinders many women mentally and sexually.)<br>  2- Attract a mate or many mates according to what men think is most attractive (it was a man that created the bra). This also involves being expected to be as feminine as possible no matter what job we have (example: female body builders are expected to have have manicures, pedicures and "pretty hair" and wear make up).<br>  <br>  These 2 things affect every aspect of our lives. School, work, family all of it is tied in to those two main things.

P4Jc76GPaa	There are a lot of symptoms that stem from the physical aspect. The problem with today's society is that everyone wants the quick fix, which they believe is a pill. Many times people are taking pills for a symptom that is purely physical, but they think it's mental. The problem is that many doctors are quick to give their patients pills instead of seeing what the problem stems from. it's not always the doctors fault because most doctors don't have a lot of experience in treating or evaluating psychological symptoms and therefore try and fix the problem with a pill. We as a society need to try and fix our problems first before trying to take a pill to try and fix the problem. If it's a physical instead of a mental problem then pills just prolong the problem. It doesn't fix it.|`|DoooQw77aa	Well, I know you said not to refer to depression, but I'm going to anyways. :) A lot of people who suffer from depression (for whatever chemical or psychological reasons) also experience physical symptoms. For example, they can get a lot of different pains, such as head aches, stomach pains and things like that and/or they can experience nausea. I think then it would be considered a physiological condition (but don't quote me on that) and there are many more physiological conditions in which causes and symptoms can be mental and physical. Also some people suffering from anxiety (cause) can experience physical symptoms (effect), such as getting diarrhea when they are really nervous. Also some people suffering from anxiety or panic disorder (psychological) can get panic attacks (effect) which are physical. They cause the heart to beat really fast I think and also breathing problems I believe. A lot of the time panic attacks are mistaken for heart attacks. I hope my answer helped. :)|`|eibO5ax3aa	Absolutely. Take PTSD, for example. Trauma leads to chemical imbalances in the brain. Post partum depression results from hormonal changes after giving birth. Physical illnesses can do the same.

It's a pretty miserable existence, I only give them a pound or so but I don't really care what they buy with it, so long as it makes them happy for a while.  Of course I'm selective as to who I give the money to though.  Sometimes I buy them a beer instead, then there's no question of where the money's going, why shouldn't they have a beer?    As I said, greybeard, be selective, you can tell who's nice and who's not.

Also, most of them are on welfare, and actually have a home.    Mostly, what they are doing is sizing people up to be mugged.    It is simply waaaaay too dangerous for real homeless people to be out on the street, by the way.  Those stupid enough (or crazy enough) to hang out there instead of a shelter, are quickly raped, robbed, murdered or beaten.    Understand when you see a "homless person" what that actually is.  It's not what you think.|`|u0160kdXaa	I don't come across as many where I live now as I did where I moved from. I sometimes would give them money. Not much. Just my change or a buck. But, not always. I sometimes see the same person working the same corner. I have been homeless before. i know that there are people who do this for a living. i have heard them discuss where the best corners are and even heard them tell each other to stay off 'my' corner.    There are people who are genuinely unable to provide for themselves for whatever reason. There are places they could go to but won't because these places are strict and religious. Often they are not eligible for government assistance because they blew it some how. Some of them are alcoholics and/or drug addicts. Giving them money only enables their habit.    I have just bought them some fast food a few times.|`|AA11063355	A guy came up to me the other day and asked for money "for a cup of tea" I didn't give him any, but went into Mc Donald's and bought him one, as I offered it to him, he got nasty and told me to F**k Off!

There's not a lot of porn that most women enjoy, especially straight women.  There's gay and lesbian porn, but I think most women who watch these are usually bi or lesbian.  Well I know some straight women who watch gay male porn. If they had more porn in which the man pleased the woman, maybe more women would watch it.  Also, I hear a lot of them say that men in porn are ugly.   They want the women in porn to be more respected.|`|Uv7onQaQaa	Of course there is an inherent double standard in porn... just like with sex... a man has sex with a lot of ppl (or an cam) and hes a stud, a women, well shes a Slut.<br>  I won't deny the fact that i think porn is degrading for women.. As great as maybe the word "sexually liberated" may seem instead, I still think a women whose in porn doesnt really have respect for herself. She has to resort to ****** hundreds of men to make a living (as great a living as that might make), i (and a great portion of the majority of ppl) still think that's dirty. It doesnt make it any less dirty for a man though, in my opinion.<br>  I'm not saying women (or men) should have to wear a chastity belt until marriage (thats extreme).. i think sex is a normal and healthy thing.. but having sex with numerous people for money (ya thats extreme too)|`|1wIek546aa	got to disagree with you about the whole "male penetration = male dominant" thing dude. i've seen some pretty crazy porn in my day and the male is NOT always dominant.<br>  <br>  any way, porn isn't degrading in my opinion and the kinds of people who think that are the kinds of people who think SEX is degrading.|`|jKph4peTaa	are you kidding me? go to redtube and look at the titles of the videos, like "b*tch gets hammered" and stuff like that. and a lot of porn shows like acted gang bangs/rapes and stuff. if that's not degrading then i don't really now what is lol|`|mWci5WUBaa	*shrugs*|`|1Xq0W8XWaa	bc the girl gets the load on her|`|a9i8Q98Aaa	I really don't know.  I'm a chick and I watch more porn than most guys, I really don't see anything degrading.  The only acts which could in my opinion be correctly classified as degrading are those found in fetish videos and while I may find them unappealing or degrading were these acts to be done to me, the women in pornography consent to it either because they are being paid to or because they find it arousing.  So really, there's no reason for people to get all riled up about pornography.  No one forces you to watch it, it's not like you can't go out for a stroll without being pelted with porn DVDs.  If it offends you, don't watch it, there are plenty of ways to block the sites.|`|xbRMGjbFaa	Well this is an interesting question. You see most of the consumers of porn are not women, they are mostly men. You are correct, the women choose to degrade themselves as do the men. It should be just as degrading for a woman as for a man. Since most of the consumers of porn are men, the men who buy this porn focus on the woman who places herself in this position of allowing the public to see her as an object of sex, and that's it. If you ask me, both sexes should respect their bodies and consider them sacred, not to be sold. Also, in many pornos, you see a woman being abused, tied up or hurt for the pleasure of a man. Some of this has stopped but some porn used to include that. Another thing, many people believe that porn breaks homes and since the primary figure and caretaker of a family is the mother, society expects more from a woman than to partake in this business. My belief is that each person makes their own decision to buy the porn and break the family, so that person is to be blamed not the industry. Well hope that answers your question.|`|RTK61TiXaa	No one pays attention to the dude in the films. people only look at the girl, and normally the dude is just there to do things you want to do to the girl. Its also the way, you think of girls after watching porn. but its not true in eveyr case i know girls that love porn not because of the dude, but because they find it entertaining watching some one else have sex. so it really depends on your motive. if you watch porn to service your self and think dirty thoughts, it will eventually rub off on you.|`|vR7Bew2Xaa	Idk i don't think it is.<br>  i'm a girl and i love porn with guys and girls..<br>  lol.|`|Rtv5aiH4aa	i think porns funny.<br>  not really degrading people that say that have probably just been used and dissed by a guy.|`|2e41580c4f9ca26f64c21c7dcc27e33faa	I think it originates (at least in part) from the very puritanical thought that women could not possibly be independently sexual.  What I mean by this is that I think there is still an overriding (although maybe unconscious) idea that women only engage in sex in order to please men, that if left to their own devices, we would not need, and certainly never WANT sex at all.  That we never have sexual thoughts independent from our desire to please a man.  So with porn, there would be a certain level of coercion involved.  This line of thought also proves out the idea that men cannot ever be degraded by being in porn because well after all, boys will be boys and all boys want sex (rubbish BTW).  It's those stupid socio-sexual constructs again.  I don't really know how this would apply to gay porn though, that sort of transcends the puritanical divide does it not? lol|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Probably 'cause it's usually the guy being the dominant one.  A lot of it it's a ton of guys on one girl.<br>  <br>  *shrugs*<br>  <br>  I figure if it's degrading, then don't do it! There's a lot more opportunities for women to make money nowadays.|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	The Porn movies I have watched all show  women  as  the passive sex.  giving blowjobs and    one was a girl  getting double penetration  she looked like  just a doll   taking it from both guys      I  don't like to degrade women but  it is cool to see  sometimes.   like another time  the girls boobs were bouncing all over and her  skinny stomach skin was  moving all over  it was sexy and it made me hard       I wish I could be the  guy who  makes her boobs  go all over and her skin blubber bounce around too   ahhhhhh   it's not degrading unless the girl feels like shes being raped.    no offense to any women out there though I just telling the truth.|`|WKtakdsOaa	Porn is not degrading. Its sexy and is there to turn you on. I am a woman and it turns me on so I think people who complain about it are too uptight|`|ZNPlNFkfaa	so people are just uptight??!|`|jN8duTx2aa	I wouldn't say all porn is degrading to women.  <br>  <br>  The issue is more that mainstream porn (ie not fetish stuff) tends to degrade women as a standard thing.<br>  <br>  It is fairly common to hear a woman called a ***** or a whore in porn, but outside of fetish porn you don't hear men called assholes or whores.  That is a huge double standard and makes it seem like calling women names in bed is standard practice.<br>  <br>  Mainstream porn frequently features sex acts that would be unpleasent or painful for the average woman (ex how a lot of the blow jobs are performed) and very rarely shows a man purely pleasuring a woman (ex oral sex on the woman).<br>  <br>  The fact that men have penises doesn't make them automatically dominate in sex and getting paid for something doesn't mean it isn't degrading.<br>  <br>  There is a double standard in porn, it is far more about the man's satisfaction than the woman's.  Really, there is nothing wrong with that, your fanatasy material is your business but you should recognize that porn doesn't include realistic female sexual satisfaction as part of the standard package and degrades women more often than men.<br>  <br>  ETA- You don't have to see a fetish video to see women engaging in sex acts that would be painful.  Just because a a woman is in the video does not mean she is enjoying herself.  I assume 99.9% of female orgasms in porn are fake.

Men tend to naturally be better at processing visual data. (It's a reason why men notice many women have difficulty in parallel parking.)    This quote is from:  http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/art...    "On average, men perform better than women at certain spatial tasks. In particular, men seem to have an advantage in tests that require the subject to imagine rotating an object or manipulating it in some other way. They also outperform women in mathematical reasoning tests and in navigating their way through a route. Further, men exhibit more accuracy in tests of target-directed motor skills--that is, in guiding or intercepting projectiles."    This, obviously, doesn't mean men are better than women at everything. Where men are better at spatial reasoning, women outperform men in verbal/language reasoning skills. These notable differences exist between the sexes because of how the sex hormones affect the development of the brain.|`|AA11052660	Can't relate to this question at all, sorry.

How old are you? Are you married? Do you have sex on a regular basis? These would help us to figure out why you had the dream also.|`|CIzrjrykaa	that your desperate ?|`|qZF4r71taa	Yes, can I join in on the fun next time?|`|6goQ3VVJaa	I just had that same dream!!!!|`|xDfPtDboaa	It means you are aroused and need to have a "release" of your tension.|`|O2IVIOawaa	Ha ha good dream! I never dream about any kind of sex but I'm also a virgin...maybe you've been getting a lot of sex lately? Hell idk
rpajoT0raa	I asked about this last week too. Why isn't this rape video game censored by this country's "ethics watchdog body"?<br>  "Amazon has stopped sales of a video game that simulates rape.<br>  The Japanese-based computer game maker, Illusion Studio, doesn't sell the product overseas because of the rating/censorship restrictions... but says J apan's "ethics watchdog body" has no problem with the game.<br>  <a href="http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/amazon-drops-japanese-rape-video-game-20090213-86r0.html" rel="nofollow">http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-wor...</a><br>  <br>  It's really disturbing that such things can be socially acceptable.|`|Lx9bVRGyaa	If what you say is true, then yes it is quite sick.  But it should not be illegal.  This game would serve as a red flag to others. Now they have a better idea of who to stay away from.  For example, if you go to a party and they are playing this game, get the hell out of there.  If you are worried about its influence, rape has been around way before video games.  I think the game would serve more of a purpose of exposure than of influence.  If you repress freedom of speech and expression, the problem still exists, it's just harder to identify.|`|1168bcccfff6f3a578ef3a0223e4cce5aa	It is deplorable that a game of this nature exists!<br>  I couldn't connect to your links so searched for it myself..... here's a link to a Telegraph article on the game. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/4611161/Rapelay-virtual-rape-game-banned-by-Amazon.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtec...</a><br>  The game was not cleared for sale in the U.K and I think M.P Keith Vaz makes the official stance clear (and rightly so) in the U.K.<br>  Anything glorifying, rationalising, marginalising or justifying sexual crimes are irreponsible - computer games are just a particularly dispicable example of that because they are traditionally the domain of easily influenced children. Have you highlighted your concerns with your congressman? I would have expected better from America.|`|jN8duTx2aa	Why did you decide to advertise this game?  You are just giving it more publicity.<br>  <br>  Isn't it clear that there are a good number of psycho woman haters on here?<br>  <br>  And it isn't being sold in America.  A seller was listing it on Ebay, but it was pulled.|`|dmCyY2SKaa	I'm not surprised that the video game is Japanese.|`|FUIBscKGaa	I shouldn't be posting, cause I got a good beer buzz, but I can't just skip over this.  This has been all over the blogosphere.  It's pretty bad.<br>  <br>  And of course I can't pass up the opportunity to remind those not in the know that Partriarch verch or lurch or whatever, is a self proclaimed mra.  They are a pedophilia and rape promoting group, and their front is father's rights.  The second link that I am posting, is to an attorney named Liz's page, which is a complete library of all things mra, including their lawyers/leaders/and signers of the Fathers' Manifesto.  Every thing is fully sourced, documented, and links to many mra sights.  No wonder patriarch dude is using glorified rape as entertainment as an excuse to rank on those evil rape victims, and pretend to be all manly like.  Rock on there, Lurch!<br>  <br>  That was really hard to write, given my beer goggles.  Glad I got through it.  Oh yeah, the following is also a sourced and direct quote from one of the pervy mra leaders.

qUeNrusdaa	Please be patient and read this all the way to the end.  I'll try to be brief.<br>  1.  I've always loved economics & finance and I've learned that it's very important to gather a wide variety of information and opinions.  No single source ever seems to have more than a small part of the big picture.  You - or your economic advisor - will need to read numerous magazines, newspapers & websites to really get a better view of that big picture.<br>  2.  As the result of doing the above, I believe that we find ourselves in a situation in which we have only seen - and responded to - the "tip of the iceberg".  The huge banks that are the pillars of our entire  financial system are holding an enormous, almost unimaginable, amount of "toxic" debt.  Not billions, but trillions of dollars, of this bad debt.<br>  3.  Some wise observers have said that our government cannot stop the collapse - it can only slow it down or "attempt to manage it".  I agree with them.<br>  4.  I believe our economy will be in very bad shape for the next three to five years.<br>  5.  Our greater concern should be how this economic collapse is effecting the rest of the world.  There is increasing civil unrest in many countries as hundred of thousands of people are losing their jobs and have no way to support their families.  This unrest could explode into harsh government crackdowns, more riots, etc.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to share this dark view of next few years.  I hope I'm wrong about all this, but I don't think I am.  George Soros is a very intelligent man and speaks honestly and directly.  It's wise to listen to what he says.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Ka7UjuMbaa	Obama is a loony...bast***d.

For me, I just can't afford to "feel" down & depressed about the economic crisis. <br>  <br>  But have you seen this in the news lately about the 90 year old guy who had to go back to work. I like his positive attitude. It's like he can't afford to be depressed too, check it out:<br>  <a href="http://video.ap.org/?f=WASEA&pid=96lQnru0wMYwJu47rqoCUbby11xpGeSy" rel="nofollow">http://video.ap.org/?f=WASEA&pid=96lQnru...</a><br>  <br>  It's 12:50 AM & my eyes are falling asleep!

IpHIeaMEaa	You are unprepared or have not studied for class so you feel you do not belong.|`|qZF4r71taa	Your spiritual domain is disturbed and your aura of innocence will be broken within the next week or so.|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	Anxieties.. sounds like you have a test coming up better start studying.
4Vw9An50aa	You really need to speak to someone about this.|`|50UbJp14aa	you need to go and speak to a councillor before the situation turns from bad to worse|`|UwiGwDGdaa	You need professional help. Self-injury is a method of coping with extreme emotions - a negative method. You say you don't know how to handle anything, and self-injury is your way.  Professional help - most likely cognitive behavioral therapy - is your best answer. Talk to your parents and say you would like to see a counselor, or even go to your school counselor.    You don't have to tell your parents the specific reason, you can say something like "I'm having a rough time emotionally right now. I'd like to talk to someone neutral to help deal with it - would you take me to a psychologist?"     My favorite website is listed below.|`|6wxgyGy5aa	You definitely need to go to a counsellor or something.  If you don't like the first one, find another, and another until you find one you feel understands you and your problems.|`|FumERLamaa	talk to someone who can help you  there are services available to you  you've just gotta find them-try searching google for teenage advice about cutting yourself/suicidal thoughts not the only one in the same situation...    is there is reason to why you feel the need to cut yourself?  maybe it's a psychological explanation for it all|`|qUntsVD4aa	U WANT to KNOW WHAT TO DO, so you want to Live. Good on you and just take it from there. I want to LIVE again, not DIE!! if I didn't Love myself I wouldn't feed myself when I'm hungry. ok? lol so start anew. Start LIFE again by pretending your a new born-"adult" in this world. Always play with respect. That means respecting Urself! its all in Ur head love!|`|C0yagFFoaa	two things, go see adoctor if you arent already. tell them everything.  and do oyur best, remember if you kill oyur self, you will break your families heart, and they will be sad forever. i know this will happen.  so never kill your self, no matter how bad you feel.  load sof people feel terrible, and jsut get on with it.  i used to cut myself when i was a teenager, dont know why i did it, maybe to get attention. then i realised that i had loads of freinds, i just had to meet them first.  so now i get tattoed, and i wish i hadnt cut myself, as i hav escars, and it ruins the flow of the tattooss.  good luck|`|ZWrLzr0vaa	Okay you need to see that cutting yourself is not the answer to feeling better. I used to be a self harmer and I loved the feeling I got when I did it. 4 years now and I have not harmed myself and that's because I don't want to hurt the people I love. It just wasn't me who I was harming it was everyone else. I think your best option would be Cognitive therapy. This treatment will help you find other ways on coping with anger. Sounds to me also that you might be depressed. Going to a doctor could help. There is  no magic wand to make everything better straight away but I promise you things do get better!!!|`|OdoLSDlXaa	You should be able to visit a counselor if you are in school.  The counselor might be able to connect you with someone that can help.  You're family does not even have to know.  If you see your regular doctor he or she can prescribe something that can help, but your parents would know about it then.  Try to get a good support network of friends and extended family and try keeping in regular contact with those supportive people.  You might consider trying to get into a sport like martial arts.|`|emgIjPqMaa	Im the same way.
o0U2K84oaa	Yeah. Guys would look at your looks instead of who you are inside.|`|711KONwOaa	yes because guys will be to shy to talk to u|`|CdCpNtFOaa	you wouldnt know!|`|BtDGWKSNaa	yes.  then men don't see you for who you truly are, just what you look like.  being beautiful has also turned many a woman into being a selfish b*tch.<br>  i wouldn't know because i'm not even close to being pretty, but i've seen it happen.|`|J031Sg34aa	Yes. You can be used or be in a relationship because of your looks, or you could fool YOURSELF with your looks, and become full of yourself, which could possibly cause losses in friendship.|`|G4wINvnHaa	yes, shallow people will only spend time around you because they will be associated with your good looks|`|gjMkNCrQaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  Certainly and precisely. One exemplar is on love. Of course, if you're gorgeous, then, let's say, all guys will get attracted. So, it's absolutely arduous to know if the guy really loves you or it's just an infatuation or attraction. Another, girls will get jealous. Sometimes, beauty ain't beauty at all. It brings disadvantages. <br>  <br>  God bless!<br>  Be safe!|`|Oz2NNuJkaa	At-times it can be a disadvantage you know often when your too pretty girls envy you and that can be really dangerous cauz they you know can do any thing to prevent the guys looking at you|`|Zzq80w6Jaa	Yes, intimidating the opposite sex, jealousy from the same sex, unwanted attention...|`|gKak1Rx7aa	yes cuz you dont no if guys truly like you or want to be with you cuz your good looking|`|iuarBJ9Aaa	nope
NpFwtGiuaa	Basically this person is saying that most people make decisions emotionally rather than logically. Which I think is true. It takes a lot of conscious awareness to make a logical decision--especially when it is also a highly emotional choice (I'm in love with this new cd, but I don't have enough cash to buy it, but I can put it on my credit card...)<br>  <br>  Logical reasoning skills, apparently, is fairly new in the evolution of the brain while emotional response is deeply rooted. It takes a lot more brain power to be logical, while it's a lot easier to be reactive. <br>  <br>  What's humorously ironic to me is how negatively emotional the person is about the topic. LOL|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Not at all.  The writer of this website sounds really bitter and toxic.  I would never want this guy in in life in any way, shape or form!  While I agree that people often make decisions based upon ignorance or upon irrationality, I also see people making very sound decisions. In general people will make decisions that they believe are in their best interest based upon the options and information available to them.  Period.<br>  <br>   For the most part, the more life experience a person has and the more wisdom they gain from those experiences, the better decisions they make in their lives.  This is not something new.  People have always made the whole gamut of decisions in their lives, and this is not just a result of technology or other modern issues.  I think people often get confused about their role in the world, but this is again not a modern thing.  My thought is that it's a family thing, but that's a whole other issue.|`|M0vQFHg9aa	People are Stupid=Very true. <br>  <br>  Drugs are better then alcohol= not so true<br>  <br>  A little bit of alcohol wont have as bead of a effect compared to a bunch of pot. Vis versa too. Anything in large amounts=bad things=misery. <br>  <br>  Logical reasons aren't true=very true.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a logical reason, only common sense. If you see a hot burner, common sense tells you not to touch it. But if you touch, it doesn't mean that your stupid or illogical, it just means you did it. You do what you want when you want. We made rules for ourselves as to stay civil but there are no real rules that bind us. (Stick to the rules and stay civil anyway) We do things becuase we do things.|`|zqou7de4aa	yes i do
9VAnsWYUaa	These stories were shared between bedouins sitting around camp-fires in the oases during nights and on long journeys in the deserts of Arabia. Almost every story in this collection is reflective of what the life-style was and how the society behaved as a whole, even if they aren't very accurate.
tcvQwTa5aa	I have read(from many different books)that you can actually confide and interact with people in spirit as you sleep.It doesn't make alot of sense to our rational waking mind,but our spirit is boundless and can go anywhere when we sleep.It is said that we have a silver cord that keeps our spirits attached to our body as long as we live and that astral(spiritual) travel is a common occurence.Most of the time our waking minds are left unaware of what our spirit is doing.This all may be confusing to you but it is only the rational side of your mind that doesn't understand it.The spirit is all knowing and all wise because it is that part of us that is like God.And that is the part of us that returns to God when we cease to live.We are eternal and divine,it's just that alot of us don't know it.|`|2kg2cOHOaa	...uhhh
425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	If I'm understanding what I've read correctly, non-verbal LD means that there's reasonable to high functioning verbally, with impairment in other areas of cognition.<br>  <br>  So I'm going to surmise that non-visual LD means that your friend and family member do ok to well when information is presented visually but really struggle when it's not. Does that sound like it fits at all with your experience of them? The areas in which they might struggle (again, if I'm understanding this correctly) include motor skills/coordination, verbal abilities, and social areas. <br>  <br>  If it does, let me know and I'll see what else I can figure out. There's something about right hemisphere impairment with non-verbal LD. I'm not sure what the significance of that is, other than diagnostic.<br>  <br>  One source I found suggests that a high percentage of autistic spectrum folk have non-verbal LD, but not all NVLD are AS. So ASD sites might have some information, but you have to read carefully because not all of it will apply.<br>  <br>  I can't find anything on non-visual either. The information on non-verbal should give us a clue though.|`|bgA9wLD0aa	have you tried asperger's or autism sites?  i'm thinking it could be something like face blindness or the inability to read body language.

Beautiful dress by the way.|`|1wIek546aa	men have silky boxer briefs, which i've heard are much more comfortable that lacy things...    not to mention women's clothes are made to be form fitting, so you have to be careful of how you move and walk around. men's clothes are looser, and generally more comfortable.|`|LR48Rtv2aa	Men's clothes are way more comfortable because they are made with durable material and they last longer.|`|5DB6nOXkaa	Well it's proven that when you wear softer materials (cashmere, silk, etc) you attract more physical touch. We like to be touched. period. Do yourself a favor and buy a cashmere sweater..it's heavenly|`|eibO5ax3aa	But did you wear the bra and the heels that go with the outfit? Neither are fun.|`|oqO6ff4caa	see...i feel the opposite. a mens button up shirt is much more comfortable than a dress with a strapless bra that keeps falling and digging in and twisting and bla bla bla and then trying to find comfortable underwear that doesnt show lines in a dress.... good luck. we may have softer and different materials but mens clothes in general are much more comfortable.|`|AA10954273	You've obviously never had to deal with bras, pantyhose or high heels.  I'll take jeans and a t-shirt any day.|`|QRPvIB8Yaa	Well women and mens clothes are different than each other because they have been shaped by their different roles, women definitely have more freedom in wearing clothes than men today and their clothes can be more comfortable. You shouldnt believe everything you read in brochures trying to sell you products. And honetly do you think corsets are comfortable? Have ever seen those girls walking through town on freezing nights our with giant heels on? I always think dey must be in pain.|`|zRPXczxAaa	A thing I notice about heterosexual men looking for an excuse to wear their wive's clothes, so that they can (in their imaginations) experience the great erotic thrill of being their wives--is that they are so absorbed in their fantasy that they don't notice when they're actually uncomfortable.  It's like the idea of satin sheets, which sound wonderful, till you actually experience them--then, unless you're a romantic lunatic, you'll want your linen or cotton sheets back.  Women's clothes are horribly uncomfortable:  Hot, itchy, confining, stretching; and the fabrics--silks and polyesters--feel terrible next to skin that's used to cotton, linen and even hemp fiber (which feels like super linen).  Giddy on, Bucko--next you'll be telling us how good it feels to clog the skin of your face and eyelids with makeup.  No doubt, to you, with your limitless faculty of autogynephiliac delusion, it does feel good.|`|f0a65c9a2c03d345ba6be884d69e7908aa	you're my hero pics plz.
5w1NQcXyaa	If I knew what your feelings were during this dream I think I could give you a better opinion.  But I think this is a dream that exists in so many layers, as life does, and dreams almost always do...<br>  You are in conflict--and your two 'loves'--are symbolically in conflict in your dream. Your feelings during the fight are important--your feelings during the whole dream are important--but I focus on the climax (no pun intended!! lol) of the dream which is your inner conflict being acted out dramatically as you watch passively. Do you have feelings in this dream or is this being played out in front of you like a movie while you observe stoically?  <br>  I think that the primary issue is security and your own inability to resolve the conflict yourself.  Your dream begins with the party--you leave the party looking for a safe place to act out your conflict--the house.  <br>    I suspect you have a traditional streak--and that it has been part of the difficulty you've been living with as a divorced person. You respect house and home, and probably the tradition of marriage, which is sheltered in our homes and houses.  <br>  Clearly, you are torn between the security of an old relationship--a romantic interest that actually became a marriage--and the possibility of finding that security with someone new. You say your ex randomly kissed you--how did that feel?  Right? Wrong?  Mixed up?  If the kiss gave you pleasure, find inside yourself where you got the pleasure from:  was it more from your impulse to feel loved, or was it more from your impulse to feel secure, to feel like someone is taking care of you?  Knowing that may provide a clue about what is most missing to you now and what you want, so that you can guide yourself towards happiness in the future. <br>  There is probably a part of this that is healing--an admission of mistakes made by your husband, you feeling wanted again by him.  And the added reassurance brought on by the presence of a new man who finds you extremely desirable. You describe him as your crush, so this man is someone you certainly find attractive. That's got to be soothing to you.  I hope it is.The fighting represents your own passionate involvement in the conflict of your life right now: being alone and surviving without the shelter of attachment to a supportive man. But you need time.  Do not make any sudden moves if in real life these men are present to you and behaving along the same lines as in your dream. Go slow and let things within you settle.  Take time to heal, and this is important--to FIND YOURSELF inside this conflict.<br>  Because now I'm going to talk about one of those layers I referred to at the beginning.  There's a whole other layer that seems to exist here. That is your own repressed animus--that would be both your true self, plus the masculine side of your own personality.  Everyone has both masculine and feminine sides, which Carl Jung explained best (google these terms and you might get some insights!).<br>  Perhaps you are a passive and passionate, loving lady who hasn't yet learned to assert herself. This is very common for women!  It's also common for both women and men to be out of touch with the masculine and feminine parts of their own personality.  To be a balanced person, each of us must be able to function being in touch with both.  When a man, for example, is the kind of person out of touch with his feminine side, or anima, he will most likely be uncomfortable with the softer, less defined issues of life; uncomfortable functioning on an emotional level, and as a result--the women in his life have too much control over him. An extreme man of this type has an exterior of toughness but his woman directs his life.<br>  He may have a lot of anger about that, but be helpless about how to deal with that anger, since that would mean getting in touch with his emotions, which he just cannot do.  <br>  A woman out of touch with her animus, or masculine side, cannot function well as an assertive person and may have difficulty structuring her own life and making decisions on her own.  She may feel a great need for security because it is so difficult on her own. She too may end up in relationships where she is over-controlled--but by a man, because she cannot easily assert her own needs. I am wondering about what your dream might say about you and your own animus, your own masculine side.  It sounds as if you might long for security (everyone does, all of this is just a question of degree, balance being the key to health in this life...).  And it might suggest that you let the men in your life run the show--perhaps a little bit more than what would be required.<br>  You can take steps to take charge! Try a therapist, support group or whatever resources you can find in assertiveness training. I truly believe that your happiness depends upon it. Focus on your ability to feel security coming from within yourself right now, not on the men in your life. Women are conditioned to be passive, to everyone's detriment.  Just as men are conditioned to be out of touch with feelings! I wish you health and peace.  Take care!|`|mItsW20naa	Its just that - a dream.

cWxwHMQWaa	My ex had a phase where he wasn't interested in sex. I was willing to understand and didn't bother him about it, but it made me feel ******* horrible about myself and our relationship.     I did everything imaginable as far as initiating, tried everything I could think of to get him into it, it didn't work. Eventually I gave up and then guess what happened? He snapped out of it and then *I* was turned off from sex. This was only after weeks of it, never mind years. I can't even fathom sticking around YEARS only having sex on holidays. I wouldn't even WANT it then.    We talked from the start and he said he didn't know what his issue was and he'd try to think it over, he never did. So I'd ask him again and he'd come off like I was bothering him with it. I felt and still feel I had every right to. If I decided I didn't want sex, I'd be prepared to give him some good reasons and really take the time to think about what was going on for me.     In the end, with him it was just another mindfuck, he was a manipulative son of a ***** haha So, no idea what your wife's issue is, but from my POV, weeks is long enough, let alone months and YEARS. If you married for love, she owes you better than this. If you married for any other reason, then this is part of what you signed up for, she owes you little. Only you know which is true.     If you married for love, I wouldn't suggest cheating, you're better off separating than to cheat, really. From experience, I know how hard this is and how it can take someone who'd always thought cheating was abominable and make them ****** in the head enough to actually do it anyhow. Again, from experience, if you think cheating is horrible, don't do it, it won't be worth it and you'll be reeling from it for months. It's just not worth it.     This is a terrible situation. People make light of sex, and if ALL partners agree it's not a big issue, then that's fine, they're not going to suffer for it. But when everyone's not in agreement, it's a huge issue. Sex is usually one of the most major differences between friendship and a spouse. To belittle it and act as if it's not a huge deal to me is pretty ridiculous.    Being understanding and patient only goes so far when the one you're with isn't holding up their end of the deal and working to find a way where EVERYONE is content with the situation.     It's not fair or loving of her to expect you to live the rest of your life this way. Best luck!    ** Honesty is huge in a loving relationship, but I'd say stick with your instinct about not mentioning to your wife that you were tempted to cheat. You didn't, you don't plan to, so I don't see any reason to bring it up, it'll likely just create a mess over nothing, yanno?      Also, if she's sticking with the reason that it hurts...did you guys never get into oral or anything? There's other things that can be done to relieve the 'tension'.    Has she seen a doctor about the pain? Anyone I know who's had a baby went to check-ups every few months for the first year after natural birth (not sure with c-sections, haven't known many who've had them). You'd think if she were having pain, she'd bring it up then? And why the two stories, one saying it's painful and another saying it's just not necessary in the marriage anymore?    Plus the other details, if it's happening the way you're telling it, this doesn't sound like it's just an issue of it hurting her which has made her decide you two don't need to have sex any more.     If it were me, I'd be a lot more firm about this and not let her off with such a halfassed 'explanation' of what's going on.     Best luck! Hope this works out between you!    And, of course, thanks sam, yours too! =o)|`|zIqfIIlMaa	According to the law, you have grounds for divorce.   Remember though that cheating will cause you a lot more than you would ever imagine in a court house.     Just talk to your wife everything you feel and don't be equivocal. Say it out.     If its medical, called dispareunia, it may be a sign of some anatomical problem or even malignancy.     Your best bet is to confront her without emotions, find out if she says its medical, and point out the dangers, consult a doctor. If she backs away leave it to that.   Consult a divorce attorney and get a good advice on how to get a divorce without loosing your home or kid.|`|H55nCLqPaa	You're right not to go behind her back. What you should do is just tell her up front ''I've decided I'm going to start having sex again, if it isn't with you it's going to be with some other woman''.    That way she knows definitely that her not providing you with sex is the direct cause of your seeking it elsewhere. Basically, in her mind, you already signed the contract, she's already got you in the bag so why should she put any more effort in? The sex was like those introductory rates that banks give you to get you open an account with them. It's just bait.    Just give her the clear choice; either she takes care of things or you go elsewhere.|`|ACOsW9ytaa	If it's been 3 years and your wife still says that it hurts it's very likely that she may have tore something during the labour. I have a friend who done this and by the sounds of it it sounds very similar, she didn't go to the doctors for years because she was too embarrassed but apparently its very commen. It meant her having to have a small operation but after she had recovered from this her and her husband went on to have a completely normal sex life. I'd really suggest you perhaps mention that it's not normal for it to still be hurting 3 years later, but make sure you say it in a concerned way and don't sound like its because you missing sex (no matter how true it may be) because this is more likely to upset her. Good luck!|`|wkjncmHTaa	You sound a really nice guy and she's lucky to have you. But isn't it for BOTH of you to decide if you've 'reached a point in the relationship where sex isn't that important anymore'?? Just because it isn't important for her doesn't mean it should automatically be not important for you. Do you really want to be celibate for the rest of your life? Even if you are ok with that, she should respect your time alone. Make it clear to her that you need time alone every now and then, even if you are not willing to consider other things e.g. an open relationship. If she really loves and respects you she should be willing to grant you that.    I also think she should get checked out if it's physically hurting afterwards. And even if it does, this isn't a reason why you shouldn't be able to have other types of mutual sexual activity.    Good answer amandamaria.|`|BkleL3F4aa	its willful neglect and grounds for a divorce.    as Janey says it might be a medical problem but if its not its one or both of these two things    she is using sex as a weapon    she is no longer interested in you and you are only support and a father to the child, not a husband    "I have NEEDS and it seems like she is somehow enjoying watching the pain/suffering it's causing me. "    Its called witholding, its a form of emotional abuse, divorce this person.        ignore sigy she is 12 or 13.|`|t81MEJ82aa	I doubt you'll be happy jerking off the rest of your life, if you can then more power to you. But you need to man up some. Tell her that you have needs and something has to give. Either she's going to have to give you sex more, allow pornography in the house, and/or allow you to satisfy your needs elsewhere. Of course she is going to hurt afterward because she barely has sex. If she used it more she wouldn't hurt. Obviously being a wonderful mother isn't translating into being a wonderful wife. It's not reasonable to expect you to never have sex again. You allowed her to decide that sex wasn't important anymore for yourself. That's bullsh!t, it's important to you so stand up for yourself. It won't get better, if you do nothing about it especially letting her decide what is important to you. If you want a different result then you're going to have to rock the boat (no pun) if this disintegrates your marriage could you imagine staying in this situation? Allowing your child to see you resent his mother.    EDIT:  Please disregard some of these women's answers. Good lord, most of them give the same answer. "She must have a secret medical condition", "She may not know that you aren't happy with sex twice a year", "Maybe you should help with the dishes". Complete BS. Just confront the woman and put your cards out there. You're not happy with this arrangement so don't stand for it.|`|YzwuDRfYaa	Your wife sounds like a real "dog-in-the-manger" type.    Since she's no longer interested in having sex, she seems determined that you shouldn't be, either !    This is the kind of behavior which drives men towards the arms of more "accommodating" women.  In the circumstances, your consideration for your wife might be described as misplaced.|`|dXyR1R8Yaa	Firstly you sound like a genuinely nice guy, you still respect your wife's decision and have not cheated, despite the struggle you have been put in.   But you seriously need to talk to her and explain how you are feeling. It is better you talk now and persuade her to try to understand how you are feeling than to have to explain to her later why you had an affair or why you need a divorce. It is not fair for you to go on like this without a proper explanation. If there is some medical thing you deserve to know, and if not she needs to cut you some slack.   I know it probably seems obvious to you what is happening, but it is a possibility that she assumes you are fine with it because you haven't said anything. It is just not fair that you aren't enjoying your relationship any more because of it. Speak up, because you seem like a nice guy so I really hope things turn for the better for you.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	I think you should sit down and discuss the situation with your wife.  She needs to see a doctor - try telling her about the massage parlour incident and how you almost betrayed your marriage.  Your wife should not be in any pain 3 years after the birth of your son.

I commend your faithfulness - she needs to do so, too.|`|2e41580c4f9ca26f64c21c7dcc27e33faa	It seems as though she is totally focused on your child.  In some parts of the mommy brain, good mommies don't do "that".  She is so consumed with caring for and about your child that she has no room to care for anyone else.  She also may not feel sexual.  She may feel like that part of her life is over, and she now must be only mommy.  She knows it hurts you, she is sorry and but cannot stop it.  SHe feels like it has gone on so long now that it is almost futile to try and fix it.  She is praying you won't leave her, she also knows she is driving you to seek comfort elsewhere.  Why do I speak with authority?  Because for a very short time after my child was born (like 6 months, from the time she was 1 til about 1 1/2), I was your wife and this is how I felt.  It was so lonely and incredibly painful for me to see what I was doing to him, but I could not physically or emotionally bring myself to do it.  I couldn't.  And to this day I don't know why it happened.    What you can do to fix it:  Insist on 'date night' one night a week.  Do NOT pressure her for sex or even bring it up.  The primary focus is to change her perception of herself from just juniors mommy to a person in her own right.  Have adult conversation that isn't about the child or sex.  Do NOT pay her sexual compliments, she will immediately know why you are paying attention to her and what you want, this will hurt her.  You need to reconnect as a couple rather than a triad.  Work on that and the sex will happen.  I promise.

But it's time to man up.  Tucking your balls away and turning into a little puppy is just...  well..  sad.      What she's done is far worse than cheating.  She's betrayed your trust.  Betrayed your dreams and life plan.  Unless she told you that sex would stop after she gave birth BEFORE you got married...  then, she's falsely advertised before signing the contract.  And breached said contract.      While it may not have been written or spoken.  It's generally accepted that sex is part of the relationship.  A very important part.  If you guys were going at it before marriage then it's ok to expect at least a portion of that after marriage until one of your genitals just doesn't work anymore (age 60+).  If she has a medical reason why she doesn't want to have sex, tell her to visit the doc and fix it.    Personally, I'd go get it somewhere else if she's got no good excuse.  If she's not willing to keep you happy, find someone who will.  Mind you, going behind her back isn't quite right.  So just tell her, if she's not going to the wife you married, then you've got to move on and find your own happiness.  It's great she's happy without sex, but you deserve to be happy as well.    This may involve divorce.  And yeah your kid is important.  But you can't father a child properly if you're constantly resenting your wife.  Your sanity will slip away.

Y52s7dfNaa	"To dream that you are pregnant, symbolizes an aspect of yourself or some aspect of your personal life that is growing and developing. You may not be ready to talk about it or act on it. This may also represent the birth of a new idea, direction, project or goal."

However, emotionally and psychologically, that person can still be considered a virgin, because this person did not make the choice to "give it up."

gcZSwvvUaa	u're putting the cart before the horse. sex is the final step in rebuilding her. if u're starting from the beginning u need to take a mental audit of her positive traits and be ready to compliment her when she is being good. and also just compliment her randomly at least once a day. don't overdo it, make it simple, small and sincere. then as she begins to accept it u can try some more potent stuff.<br>  <br>  if u r lucky u will see her begin to open up and display some sensuality. encourage that and give her simple physical love like kisses and hugs. it will take a lot of time because at that point u r building trust... but feel lucky u even got to that point and keep ur focus on her and know her completely. then when the time is right she will let u know and u can be intimate.<br>  <br>  oh ya some have said to not focus ur compliments on her physical traits. that's good advice. so for every physical compliment u give her make sure u give at least two other non-physical compliments.<br>  <br>  and u r being a great person by helping her. i think if u can do it great things will happen. God bless!|`|ToILKl6waa	Help her feel better about herself. When therapy is over, reward her and give her encouraging words, reassuring her that you'll always be there for her. Compliment her often and try to hold back on the fighting - it's not what either of you need. Most girls are insecure about their weight, but she has to understand that other people do not see her the way she may see herself. People are more accepting than thought to be.<br>  <br>  Also, I advise you to do more things with her, offer to pay after dinner out - be more of a gentleman than ever before. Listen to her when she talks, ask if she's feeling alright, even lend a helping hand in her daily chores. If you make her feel loved and supported, her self image can only improve.|`|9d2aOK36aa	cuddle up more? my boyfriend made me feel so pretty when he wanted to stay close to me!|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	One of the things she has to do is see herself as much more than just a body or just a face.  She focuses on her externals because she feels really ugly INSIDE.  It's easier for her to get distressed about her physical self because it's easier for her to focus on that, rather than dig inside herself for the roots of her low self-esteem.  Good for her that she'll be starting therapy!  You can't make her feel better about herself.... that's her job.  Suggestions:  You can be supportive of her therapy.  Stop focusing on her beauty (and by the way.... fat people can be beautiful!!!!  geez!!!!) when you compliment her.  On any given occasion, ask her what she needs from you in terms of support.  Remember that her progress is probably going to be slow, so ask yourself if you can be patient.  If you can't, be honest and tell her.  If you can, fine.|`|xPeIvywdaa	make her feel wanted<br>  <br>  the biggest trick to this is giving genuine compliments and saying genuine good things, you cant just fake a compliment or say she "looks beautiful" everyday because then it loses its meaning|`|uGxWOIOdaa	Praise her for all her positives & help her work on the negatives.<br>  Be a supportive type of guy/boyfriend.<br>  Good Luck|`|de28048ab10e261734a9e1e41461c18aaa	tell her she is beautiful everyday.. drive her to the professional yourself or just tell her that deep doen in your heart that you would really like for her to go because you care about her so much and that you would like nothing more then for her to like who she is :)|`|TYRRjIv4aa	Firstly, I commend you for being a stand up guy and caring about her emotions; most men would not even bother with that. Secondly, she is obviously in deep depression as you are probably aware. You must continue to be supportive, honest, and help feed into a positive life style/self esteem. <br>  <br>  Pay extra attention to small details such as how she wears her hair, the type of perfume scent, the new lip stick color, or how she looks in a outfit. DO NOT BE EXTREMELY OBVIOUS, BUT SMILE AND COMPLIANT HER. <br>  <br>  She needs your continued support to get that courage to fight her inner problems. Listen and do the best you can sexually for the time being. Once she is treated she will be back to herself as she will get to the core issue of her depression. This may be a reflection of something that occurred earlier in her life that you are not aware of. Good luck and let me know how it goes! :)

57fZyjvgaa	Camila, your English on paper is better than most people who learned English as their first language! I'm sure you'll do fine.  In my speech class last year we had a girl who barely knew English - there was no reason to make fun of her, instead we gave her suggestions on how to improve. No one should make fun of you - and if they do then they should try completing a speech in YOUR native language and see how THEY do.   People aren't as mean as we tend to make them out to be.|`|C0yagFFoaa	hi  preparation is the key,     know your subject inside out, be able to say your speech without notes.    bring notes, to glance at to remind you where you are.    if you 'freeze' dont panic.!!!    think, of the next word in your speech , then slowly start to talk again. this is important.    if you can do that bit, you will be ok.    another tip do not hold anything in your hands, as if they shake you will look nervous, and the sight of your hands shaking will mess with you.    before you start, take twelve deep breaths slowly, this will give oyu lots of endorphins, which will relax you.    so imagine you are standing there, back straight, hands idly at your side. breath.Smile. look at people you know in the audience.    practise your speech out loud for the entire speech, three or four times.  if you really do this you will not fail.  you will win.  i guarantee it.    good luck|`|pdIWs1qgaa	I had the same problems, but English is my first language. What I do is not take the situation seriously, but still act professional. Pretend you're just acting or joking with friends.

There is no quick fix.  Confidence must be warmed up, worked out, and stretched on a consistent basis to reach maximum potential and peak performance.  Here are some steps to get you started:    1.   Mentally prepare.  Take stock of where you are, where you want to go, and commit yourself to starting and staying with it.    2.   Look at what you have already achieved by writing out your 5 greatest accomplishments or finest moments.  You may want to post this somewhere you can see it often.    3.  Give yourself credit for everything you try.  By applauding yourself for  trying you will build confidence.    4.   Approach new experiences as opportunities to learn regardless of the outcome.    5.   Listen to self talk.  Eliminate negative self-talk.  If you have self-doubts, write them down and challenge them with rational solutions.    6.   Build your knowledge and/or skills by taking a class or course.  Go get the degree or certificate that will prove your abilities to the world and yourself.    7.   Understand that you will make mistakes and you will not be perfect.  Perfection is the antagonist of confidence.    8.   Set small goals (as steps to your bigger goals) and when you achieve them celebrate.    9.   Continue to stretch yourself by setting even bigger goals.    10.  Hire a coach if you can't do it on your own.    11.Practice speaking before your close friends.    12.Correct yourself after friends' feedback.         Self-confidence is about balance.  You know that negative outcomes are possible, but rather than exaggerating or minimizing it, you give it the due attention necessary (what can I do if this happens ...). Perhaps a better definition of confidence is the state of balanced perceptions and preparation.         And what will be the result of this new found confidence?  Those around you will notice your confidence and you will inspire confidence in others.    I say  "Confidence gives you courage and extends your reach.  It lets you take greater risks and achieve far more than you ever thought possible!"
c1c17b1f723ec85d9ce67ef211d0a847aa	Unlike everone eils that answerd, i think that i have a better understanding of the question (i hope). I think that domistic violence is very high in america. We might not have armed confelct, but we still have violence.     "Physical violence is estimated to occur in 4 to 6 million intimate relationships each year in the United States." 1.

What would you change? What decisions would you alter? Lost loves, missed opportunities, broken promises, or failed relationships might just be a few of the events you might revisit. Perhaps traveling to distant exotic lands were always on your list, but never realized. Taking up a hobby like playing an instrument, painting, or writing was something you never got around to doing. Or spending more time with family or friends. Whatever it was, its now too late. Youre older and past your prime. As the days dwindle down to a precious few, all you can do is contemplate what might have been.    Suppose that one couldnt change the previous life, but, had an opportunity to relive ones life again. It would be a rebirth that allowed the person to retain all their memories of the current life that was coming to an end and start anew within a young body. Now wouldnt that be the best of all worlds? But is it truly possible to imagine what that would be like?    Humans, because of their thinking, reasoning, egocentric type of consciousness usually will choose to spend a longer time in this in-between plane before moving on to a new life. This varies with the individual consciousness involved and the choice is strictly theirs to make. One who is impatient and who found physical life enchanting might for instance, anxious to live again, decide to reincarnate almost immediately, desiring to get back into the game quickly. Others might make a wiser choice to take the necessary time to reexamine and reorient their consciousness, look back on their past life, learning from its experience and then begin making definite plans for a future incarnation.  Remember that in your next life, you will not look the same and neither will you. If you were a woman, you could just as likely reincarnate as a man, so don't expect good old "Fluffy" to look the same either.

1wIek546aa	or the sincerest form of CREEPY AS FCK.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	How do you know it was a man?<br>  <br>  Either way, it's just kind of immature and stupid to me.<br>  <br>  Scratch that.  It IS stupid and immature to clone somebody.  There's no "kind of" to it.|`|mI4lrKdHaa	Far as I'm concerned you can keep your cloning. Who the heck wants to come back as a sheep?   Republicans in amurica I guess, sheeple......cheers|`|F3NNKwP9aa	it's a pedophile trying to act normal but not doing well|`|ZYp1AEspaa	Doesn't really matter does it? Whoever and whatever it is, there's certainly a lot of effort being put into it though.<br>  <br>  Why bother trying to sort it out? You can't really do anything anyway.<br>  <br>  All this "troll" stuff is mostly very unimaginative. A lot of it is hard to distinguish from plain old stupidity. Where's the thrill in that?|`|8miMWB64aa	Because only men troll, right?  :P<br>  <br>  In any case, they're just having fun.  Yeah, it's probably stupid, but aaren't so many forms of entertainment?<br>  <br>  I've come to the realization that this board is trolled so often beacuse no one respects it.  So many trolls here act so seriously that I thought they were just dumb people at first.|`|xv7YlV29aa	haha I don't understand why someone would even pretend to be you. How immature|`|K4zsztkRaa	Who cares?<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|rpajoT0raa	LOL!<br>  Trevor thinks you're a clone of me! That's so funny. I'll definitely have to take that as flattery ;-)<br>  <br>  This is reaching soap opera proportions. It's just hilarious. These answers -accusing US of being the clones -  take the cake. Trolling has entered a whole new dimension of mind games. <br>  The clones and trolls don't have the profiles with over 10,000 Y!A points. So very funny... nice try guys... ha ... ha... ha...<br>  OK guys... now go kick a ball in the park and get some fresh air and sunshine, eh?
kWEr4Cvuaa	Please don`t waste anymore of your time and tie the knob. Both of you must visit your parents......|`|AA11403603	Some dreams are merely hallucination or reflections of your mind, others are more like your soul acting in the 4th dimension This is not rocket science... astral projections, lucid dreaming, etc, can be explored. It is possible that 2 people have the exact same dream since it is something happening in another dimension, there are a series of dimensions interlocked in the same space, this is how supernatural matters take place. Now, don't be afraid of this, there is an order coordinating these matters.
eVYhqaXDaa	For the graph, the supply curve is horizontal (the government will supply any number at the price it sets). The demand curve slopes down. As the supply curve is moved up to a higher price, its intersection with the demand curve will move to the left, i.e., toward a lower quantity. Thus, a $50 license will decrease the quantity of licenses purchased. <br>  Fish tackle is a complementary good to licenses. That is, the more licenses that are sold, the more fishing tackle will be sold. With a decrease in the demand for tackle. Because the demand will decrease for every possible price, the entire demand curve for fishing tackle shifts to the left. This will result in both a lower price and lower quantity sold. That is assuming the supply is neither perfectly elastic (horizontal, change quantity w/o changing price) nor perfectly inelastic (vertical, no change in quantity, regardless of change in price).<br>  Concerning Nevada and Oregon, do you mean what will happen to demand, since you state that price remains at $30. If so, you would expect an increase in the number of licenses sold. Since those people living near those states can go fishing there instead of fishing in CA. Given that the price difference is only $20, it is unlikely that people would travel very far. As the price between NV/OR and CA's licenses become greater, people are willing to travel farther. Thus the greater the price difference, the more the demand in the lower price states will increase. As with the first graph, the supply curve for licenses would be horizontal. The demand curve would slope down. This time, however, the demand curve moves. People will demand more licenses at any given price, so the line moves right.
AA12095067	Write it down and turn it into a story - imagine what happens next or how they got to that point.<br>  <br>  You might figure out what it means - if not, you will have written an interesting story!|`|Et011ogJaa	You have to think about what each detail of this image means to you and how it makes you feel. Ask yourself.... what could the number six represent? Is it a negative or positive number to you? What does the white dress mean? The faceless tall father in farming clothes? The ring on the right hand with six fingers? Why is she not happy? Why is his arm around her? What does an old home mean to you? What do you mean by bugs you? Do you feel angry, anxious, sad or scared?<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|l2qnuSKjaa	well, u probably saw it somewhere. or something that looks like it and u dont remember, but ur brain stored it away somewhere cuz it saw it as signifcant and its tryin to make u realize something. i mean it could u dont really see any one in ur life as a real father figure, and that ur own life barely stands up to the standards u live around. i might be reading to much into this. but consider wat i say ;)|`|MbKQ5Xc0aa	hi, this looks like a classic case of electra complex unresolved. i don't know your gender but still i think you should seek help from psychoanalyst. don't feel bad as i did express what i could think off.|`|gcZSwvvUaa	is it some story? maybe u saw it b4 and forgot, and now it's stuck in ur melon. why do u fixate on it? that's rly hard to answer just by ur description.|`|mud7i4f9aa	You are a leprechan in disguise. They have magical photograph powers!
wLvX5FKGaa	I have been, and to a certain point am, in a similar situation. I've been committed a few times and know that it can be hell (a necessary hell).<br>  <br>  However, if you know that you will not act on your ideations, then I think that staying out of the hospital might be an option. (If you are, at all, at the point where you don't trust yourself, or if you do not have support... PLEASE go to the ER. Suicide is an absolutely horrible thing to do to yourself, your family and your friends.)<br>  <br>  Last week I was "cornered" by my psychiatrist and my school's clinic (long story) into being committed because I was a bit too truthful when filling out forms about suicidality. However, my therapist who has known me for about a year now is dead against having her clients committed  (unless it is absolutely necessary) and truly knows that I would not act out these ideas. She has asked me to call her everyday and tell her how I'm feeling in exchange for her convincing both my pdoc and the school clinic that I would be okay and do not need to be committed. <br>  <br>  My point here is that having someone who isn't so scared of suicidal ideation can help you. Not all clinicians will react the same way when faced with the threat of suicide. You can turn to a pdoc (but, in my experience, psychiatrists are more likely to be in favor of sending you to the ward than therapists), another therapist, or even a suicide hotline (they will not call the authorities). It is a clinician's job to assess risk and act accordingly -- if a therapist believes that a patient is acutely suicidal, it is her job to make sure that the patient is safe. <br>  <br>  I'm not so sure about lying to your therapist. If you find that you cannot trust her, I think it's time for you to find someone else. It really will be a waste of your time and hers if you pay to sit on that couch and lie. Moreover, lies eat away at the trust in a client/therapist relationship and could actually be detrimental to your therapy. I would suggest telling her that you do not feel comfortable talking about certain things because you are afraid of how ready she is to send you to a ward... it might help and could bring up an issue the two of you should talk about.<br>  <br>  Finally, I don't believe that, legally, you have"the right to refuse treatment" if a clinician believes that you will be a danger to yourself. At that point, you are deemed incapable of making that choice. That is why signing yourself out of a psychiatric hospital against medical advise (AMA) requires a whole legal process.<br>  Best of luck,<br>  Not A Prude|`|dYoXNeI1aa	You have a problem and you are seeking help for it. Lying and avoiding levels of treatment just because you are self-diagnosing is never going to get you anywhere. You sought the help of a professional. Accept that help or stop wasting their time. Sounds harsh, but that's how this stuff works.<br>  <br>  This is also more serious than a Yahoo! Answers situation. Handle your life more appropriately. Being committed is not a punishment; it's a last resort for people who can be harmful to themselves or others--which is exactly what you are.|`|l2qnuSKjaa	well, if u know u have a problem. thats obviously the first step. the 2nd step is realizing wat u have to do to get rid of the problem. try to see wat that is. ask ur self why ur having these thoughts. why u think u might need to be sent to a psych ward. u should try and recommend that ur therapist prescribe u somethin to help u. and, usually therapists can only interfere with ur life if someones elses life is in danger, or i 4got wat the other reason is. dont be too revealing on wat ur thinkin but give ur therapist the idea that they arent helpin u as much as ud like. and try to tell them that ur afraid of being sent to the psych ward. im POSITIVE they will respect ur wishes and try to find another way to help u. if not.. well.. who knows.... u mgiht wanna consider something u know?|`|kX4JPvwwaa	Your therapist is required by a set of ethical standards to report when a person is at risk of harming him/herself or others.  If she didn't talk about having you go to an inpatient setting when you are suicidal, she could lose her job.<br>  <br>  The first answer is absolutely correct.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	When you are suicidal, your therapist has an ethical responsibility to make sure you are safe.  If you are unable to keep yourself safe, then it is a requirement that a crisis assessment be conducted (usually at a mental health facility) to help you stabilize until you can keep yourself safe.  While I can understand that you don't want to be placed into a mental health facility, you are not helping yourself any by lying.  Discuss this issue with your therapist if you haven't done so already.  Ask if the two of you can draw up a safety contract for you, to help you get through those rough times.  Keep in mind that you have a huge responsibility with such a behavior contract, because you are agreeing to do certain things to keep yourself safe at those times.  If you draw one up then refuse to do what is designed to keep you safe, you have breached the therapeutic trust (it goes both ways).  These are all things for you to seriously consider.|`|AA10494978	Your therapist has to take action if she thinks you are about to endanger yourself or someone else.  Unfortunately, lying to her is not going to get to the bottom of your problems and will only prolong the pain you are feeling.  Have you told your therapist that you are getting uncomfortable with talking with her and she needs to come up with a different way to approach your sessions?  <br>  <br>  Is there anyone around you who you can talk to immediately about what is going on?  Is there another therapist available to you?    <br>  <br>  While you get a chance to straighten out what is going on with your therapist, would you be willing to talk to someone else, such as calling 1-800-784-2433 if you feel the same way again?  There are a thousand different places you can turn to right now which will help you get through this time until you can either straighten things out with your therapist or find a different one.  Don't give up!|`|440b5eeaa808017d23fb3beb1ec4fa73aa	First, I don't know all facts of your situation, but I don't think a therapist has the power to commit anybody (don't quote me on this one). However, I could be wrong.<br>  <br>  I can tell you that it doesn't do any good to lie to them, because they can't help you work out what's going on with you. If they see a pattern, they might suggest that you talk with your Psychiatrist (making an earlier appointment if needed) to change your medication, or go to the ER if you are suicidal. At least, this is how my experiences have been with my current therapist and Psychiatrist.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|auHdcMZ9aa	If you don't trust your therapist, she can't help you. Find someone else.|`|eR3vBsJWaa	im not really sure whats going on but really why are you in therapy in the first place
aLF48jM3aa	My body is definitely not perfect, but I like it. I'm not in love with it, therefore I'm working on improving it. I think self acceptance is the most important thing in a person's character. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder but then..to what extent? And beauty is skin deep, but I don't believe it's only skin deep. I mean, I believe (in the opposite sex) on a scale of 100, 40 is physical appearance and 60 is personality. For someone to claim that beauty is only skin deep, then they would be indirectly saying that in the opposite sex for them 100% is personality and 0 for external appearance, which quite frankly I doubt very many people would say. However that being said, if a gorgeous male had no depth and wasn't profound at all, I would feel no attraction towards him whatsoever. Life is all about balance, same goes for beauty. But that's my 2 cents worth of advice|`|n4vKIHTGaa	I'm fat & ugly and I'm not afraid to say it. I hate people who think highly of themselves when they're not all that.<br>  I always say I'm fat, not because I want attention, but because I know I am and I want people to see that I'm not obnoxiously oblivious!<br>  I use "beauty is in the eye of the beholder" when people tell me's I'm pretty andd skinny and stuff. It's the nice way of my saying "Ha ha I know you're lying, so you're wrong." And as much as people say that the outside doesn't count, it's not true. If books aren't judged by their cover, why do they get so fancy and eye-catching (this is books we're talking about. A metaphor.)<br>  I'm not emo. Just a teenage girl :)|`|mud7i4f9aa	My body is a magical unicorn!|`|KEOWM6NOaa	i believe in beauty inside instead of out. i hate my body. i dont look good big and not alot of guys see me as beautiful on the inside.|`|gcZSwvvUaa	i do believe beauty is more than just looks. however i hate my body. i'm overweight and not one of those people who looks good with extra pounds. so ya, suck to be me in that respect. i rarely get to make even a moderately significant connection to the opposite sex thx to that. so i live in frustration.
l2qnuSKjaa	modern and earlier havent changed that much. the skills and analytical processes are the same. but i guess how they are used and go about through therapists is different. theres not much difference, well i would think.
FK9Z75Staa	No, just a good salary.
AZM4H5vUaa	Realize that what has happened is in the past. The past is of no meaning to the real you; it is and experience that you can learn from. There is no need to hold onto what has happened because you are in the present. Watch life go by and observe the now.<br>  <br>  And yes meditation will definitely help.<br>  <br>  Namaste.|`|I59qE0WNaa	if i only knew my friend..|`|o0U2K84oaa	They say once you start blaming yourself, you can never turn back. It's self inflicted. You have the power to not think about it.|`|jJHBfgdraa	marijuana helps to eliviate the stresses that you are feeling; moreover, over a time period (unique to person, generally after about a month with average smoking 2-3 times a week) the short term memory adjusts.... longterm effects are nil so keep smoking for stress and other memory related effects!!!!
CxoogGzxaa	The Rorschach patterns aren't "supposed" to be animated. After all, when they are used in therapy, they are shown to the patients on cards/paper. Someone probably took a Rorschach pattern and made an animation out of it because they thought it would make a nice profile picture. It was indeed animated based on the properties you saw. Maybe your friend just didn't know, or he was joking with you?
