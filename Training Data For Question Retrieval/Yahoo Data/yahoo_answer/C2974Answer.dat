b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Individual governments.<br>  <br>  A protected species is any plant or animal a government declares by law to warrant protection. Most protected species are considered either threatened or endangered. In these cases, a government establishes certain rules regarding the speciesspeciesspecies, that if violated, can result in fines or criminal prosecution. Protected species laws differ from government to government. In the US, state laws may declare a species protected, while federal laws do not. In most cases a federally declared protected species must be respected by the state.<br>  <br>  Protected species laws tend to aim specifically at maintaining habitats, but some problems exist. Not all countries honor protection of given species. This is particularly important to animals living in the sea. When the US first declared humpback whales as a protected species, some countries still caught and killed them. <br>  <br>  One government cannot stop another government from reducing the numbers of a protected species. Pressure applied by several governments can convince those not recognizing the protection status of an animal to do so. But opinions differ as to when a species has recovered enough to not warrant protection. Recently, some governments have begun whaling again, irrespective of their protected species status|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	Laws that protect animals are not based on how cute they are or how much people like them. It is based on need.  If an animal like pigeons or rats population fell to the point of them needing to listed as endangered..they obviously would not be pests anymore would they.  They would be so rare people would barely ever see them or be pestered by them.  There is a species of pigeon that was endangered..the Passenger Pigeon...it went extinct despite the fact that it was extremely useful to the human race.|`|mhwBE3b6aa	Yes they would start to get protected. In most cases, the government agencies decide if a species get protected. I know this as i am a conservationist. If you wanted to un-protect or protect a species you would have to get a petition with lots of signatures and send it to a government agency stating you want it as an unprotected species.<br>  <br>  Water voles are not an unprotected species as they don't usually disturb humans or "our environment" and nor are they over populated.|`|CuMYdQV6aa	It's an interesting point. The Black Rat (Rattus rattus), which was instrumental in spreading the Black Death, is now a rare beast. Should it be given some sort of protection?

EqmklxLqaa	Good luck proving it wrong cause it’s 100 % right.  Arizona is very hot and when it rains the animals play unless they drown.  The question was: “plant and animal amputations?”  I would have to say no unless absolutely necessary.  There are prosthetic companies that make limbs for them.  Stay in school and you can be as smart as me.
uFQFRdczaa	Constant supply, no.  Most land-based plants and animals actually don't do very well when in a constant stream of water.  But a regular supply, yes.  For example, humans need about 8 cups of water per day to be healthy, but we can't drink it while we're asleep.  Most healthy people can go a day on no food, no water (they'll be less healthy after that day) but somewhere between 2 and 3 days and they'll start keeling over from dehydration.  Every plant and every animal does that way, just some of them take more or less time than we humans.  Some cactus do fine getting water 3-4 times per year, though they don't grow much during the dry time.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	It depends on the plant or animal. Kangaroo rats can go through their entire lives without drinking; they produce water metabolically. Aquatic animals need it all the time (with a few exceptions, such as lungfish). It is not just desert plants that can tolerate months of drought. Tropical plants, even the ones in rain forests are adapted to survive the one or two dry periods each year. In contrast, plants such as papyrus and water meal need that constant water supply.|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  Plants need water, oxygen, good soil and sunshine in order for them to grow.|`|FpYzxE90aa	No they do not, when you use hydroponics (Using water as a medium) you only have to water your plant two times a day and it will do quite fine, during the down period the plant is not truly receiving any water.

20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	No, global warming is not a farce, but yes less than 1% of greenhouse gases are man-made.<br>  <br>  The planet has a natural carbon cycle.  As part of this cycle, natural sources like plants and the oceans emit CO2 and they absorb CO2.  This cycle is in balance where planet absorbs as much CO2 as it emits - actually slightly more.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycl...</a><br>  <br>  When humans burn fossil fuels, we're releasing carbon that's been trapped for millions of years.  This adds new carbon to the cycle.  Even though it's a lot less than the natural sources emit, it throws the balance out of whack.  We're adding more carbon to the cycle than the planet can absorb.  <br>  <br>  What happens then is that the extra CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere, and since it's a greenhouse gas, it causes the planet to warm.<br>  <br>  It's like if you've got 2 tree trucks of equal weight leaning against eachother.  You weigh very little compared to these trees, but if you push them, you can throw their balance off and cause them to tip over.|`|fwnqB0dTaa	Less than 1% of the gasses in the atmosphere are made by man.<br>  <br>  But when you look at the amount of the greenhouse gasses that are manmade it's a different picture.<br>  <br>  Deniers state the 0.01% of increase in CO2 int he atmosphere as their hard & fast evidence that gasses are not increasing.<br>  <br>  The problem is that the 0.01% is actually 35.6% of CO2 in the atmosphere. And most of that has increased since the start of the Industrial Revolution.<br>  <br>  I am still waiting for the "denier in chief", who has quoted this figure in this question, to state if he would drink a poison that killed at 380ppm, but was safe at 280ppm - as those are the figures he is using to say that CO2 is insignificant ... If it works for CO2 it works for everything.<br>  <br>  Other greenhouse gasses have gone up by similar percentages, but the deniers refuse to accept we are responsible as they are minor gasses when you look at what they contribute to the total atmosphere.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Mochajoe is wrong, the last 2 years were NOT the coldest in the last 30 years.

In spite of 1% greenhouses gases produced by human let us try to reduce this as much as we can|`|AA10861574	When people speak of greenhouse gases, they are generally referring to carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), fluorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs, HCs, SF6) and water vapor (H2O). <br>  Greenhouse gases (GHGs) contribute to global warming by trapping energy from the sun in the Earth’s atmosphere. This trapping of energy has a warming effect, hence the term “greenhouse” gases. <br>  Ozone depletion was the major problem in the global warming theory.<br>  <br>  Greenhouse gases have both natural and human sources. Volcano eruptions, for example, are a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Nevertheless, human activities have become a major source of greenhouse gases, due in large part to the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes. Not surprisingly, since the advent of the industrial revolution and the widespread adoption of fossil fuels as an energy source, the amount of greenhouse gases added to atmosphere each year has increased greatly. In 2005, for example, global atmospheric concentrations of CO2 were 30% higher than they were prior to the Industrial Revolution.<br>  CFCs and other contributory substances are commonly referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS). Since the ozone layer prevents most harmful UVB wavelengths (270–315 nm) of ultraviolet light (UV light) from passing through the Earth's atmosphere, observed and projected decreases in ozone have generated worldwide concern leading to adoption of the Montreal Protocol banning the production of CFCs and halons as well as related ozone depleting chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethane. It is suspected that a variety of biological consequences such as increases in skin cancer, damage to plants, and reduction of plankton populations in the ocean's photic zone may result from the increased UV exposure due to ozone depletion.|`|uFQFRdczaa	Global warming is not a farce, it is a historical fact.  If it were not, we would be in an ice age like we were 12,000 years ago.  The farce is our belief in a stable, self-sustaining climate in which average temperatures don't change much year by year.  Just because it's been that way for 11,000 years doesn't mean it will continue for the next 100, or even the next 10 years.  <br>  <br>  1% can be a huge change.  I'd sure like to have 1% of the fiscal stimulus...  Heck, if the butcher had his finger on the scale, adding 1% weight for my $6 a pound meats, he's cheating me out of $.06.  Not much for me, but if you multiply that times every customer that ever shops there, times several years--it's enough to buy a car.<br>  <br>  Really, for global warming, we're talking about relatively small changes in average temperature.  There's been 0.7 degrees C of warming since the late 1800s, which doesn't mean the hottest days are .7 warmer and the coldest days are .7 warmer either.  It just means that there are more warm days than cold ones.   But that small change adds up to a big deal, particularly when it comes to agriculture.

Watch Inconvenient truth|`|34BQRUMqaa	The two primary greenhouse gases are water vapor and CO2.  Water vapor accounts for about 30 - 70% of the warming effect and CO2 accounts for about 10 - 25%.  All combined, the warming effect of our atmospheric greenhouse gases causes our planet to be about 33C warmer than it would with no such gases.<br>  <br>  Climate is very complex, but a simple calculation can show that the amount of CO2 increase, caused by human activity, is enough to have a warming effect.  The 10 - 25% CO2 effect of the 33C is 3.3C - 8.25C.  So if there were no CO2 in our atmosphere, the average global temperature would be somewhere around 3 - 8C cooler. We've increased the amount of CO2 by about 30%, which would explain a ballpark warming of 1.1C - 2.5C.  Increased CO2 doesn't have a linear effect and we haven't yet realized all the warming expected from the current levels of CO2, so that explains why it's only about 1C warmer so far.<br>  <br>  Not all opinions are equally valid. So be careful when you read things from people and sites that really don't have the scientific expertise to present valid information. If you want to learn more about global warming, spend your time at legitimate climate science research organizations and major universities with climate departments.

Another way is to grow crops that contain high amounts of vegetable oil, this can also be burnt as a fuel.<br>  <br>  Hydrogen: This element is high in energy and when burnt produces no pollution.<br>  <br>  Geothermal: this uses heat from deep down in the earth, it can be used to heat water in swimming pools in certain areas where the heat is closer to ground.

Thank you for asking.  After landfills are full and done they drill simple holes in them.  The holes are simple because they need not be very deep and the ground is still soft.

The bonus is that landfills are a renewable resource.

I'll throw you a bone and assume those are all real scientists and that they're all in the US. Now, there's also 2,685,000 scientists in the US (2001 figure, probably higher now). So let's see: 35,000/2,685,000 * 100 = 1.3%. So while they may be 35,000 scientists, they only account for 1.3% of America's scientific population. Let me say that again: 1.3%.

This decline appears to have been initiated by progressive declines in the body condition and survival of cubs, subadults, and bears 20 years of age and older, caused by the earlier break-up of spring sea ice as a result of climate warming. Once the subpopulation began to decline because of changing environmental conditions, the existing harvest was no longer sustainable, and the additive effects of climate change and over-harvest most likely accelerated the decline in subpopulation size between 1987 and 2004."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pbsg.npolar.no/" rel="nofollow">http://pbsg.npolar.no/</a>|`|gOBtB16caa	Here we go with this "those 35,000 that signed the petition are fakes" crap again.

bc1a10f4df223596a7823cf0ba6ac3e1aa	1. Meat contains only a fraction of the calories used to produce it.  The argument against meat is that the total population could be higher if everyone was a vegetarian.  As a committed carnivore. I don't accept the vegetarian perspective.  It is true that fewer people can be supported on a diet that includes meat, but I don't accept that maximizing the number of humans is a worthy objective.  I think that a smaller, healthier, happier and more secure population is more desirable than a maximal population.  Meat provides better nutrition than a vegetarian diet in the form of complex fatty acid and complete proteins with all the amino acids that a vegetarian diet cannot provide.  I certainly prefer the taste of steak over lentils.  The taste of meat contributes to enjoyment of life.  A smaller population that consumes meat is less susceptible to famine in years with a poor harvest.   Livestock serve as a reservoir of nutrition that can be drawn down in lean years. As livestock are drawn down, the demand for feed grain is reduced and the available supply for human consumption is increased.  Further, because a meat eating population has more stable nutrition, it is less susceptible to infectious diseases.  Populations that are dependent on vegetables alone go through feast and famine cycles and are vulnerable to plague in the famine years.   <br>  <br>  2. The connection between meat consumption and global warming is rather tenuous.  First, livestock are carbon neutral over a long time period.  All of the carbon consumed by livestock is cycled through the atmosphere back into vegetation.  The one caveat is that some types of livestock release more of the carbon back to the atmosphere in the form of methane, which has a larger greenhouse gas effect than carbon dioxide, than would be the case in an unperturbed environment.  On the other side of the equation, a smaller human population means fewer humans adding greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere by other means such as using fossil fuels, for example.  While livestock are a net contributor to global warming, I think that a switch to a vegetarian diet increasing the human population by 50% would contribute more to global warming.|`|t1zlbOURaa	Same as the connections between roller coasters, frog eggs and and pixie dust.|`|sSvPEf97aa	They don't effect "Global Warming".

They can be fed the pulp left after alcohol is produced from corn, or other byproducts. It's rather seldom they eat grain which people could eat. Mostly its a couple months worth before slaughter, to fatten them up.<br>  <br>        Even the small amounts of grain they get probably outweighs the food produced, but it's not a huge discrepancy.

z69rzdJZaa	I am also smack dab in the middle of ice storm Kentucky.<br>  They had 2 sites that you could take your brush and debris.<br>  One was in the middle of town, the other just outside of town (Paducah). I heard they were bulldozing and burning in Fulton, also. I don't know about the other towns in Western KY.<br>  I think it is horribly wasteful!<br>  Cut the logs, stack them up and let people who need to burn wood for heat come and get it. It might take awhile, but all the logs would be used.<br>  They would still have to burn the twigs and brush, and since it is green wood, I am pretty sure they have to put fuel on it to get it going. A really hot fire will burn green stuff, but hardly nothing but fuel will start it.<br>  They are doing it in your populated area because everyone in town with damaged trees does not want to drive 40 or 50 miles to get rid of their broken tree branches.<br>  There are still piles and piles of tree waste along the streets of Paducah, so I think you are right, it could very well take several months to get it all cleaned up.|`|EqmklxLqaa	Take video and photos and shop for a personal injury lawyer that will charge you no money up front but will take maybe 30 % of the settlement.  If you don’t want the money you could give it to me and/or buy some new trees.  When places get low on trees they just go and buy more.  That’s what I do.|`|DV4xyeChaa	1 town is doing it talk to them first<br>  2 epa?? probably legal to burn...where i live outside burning is done all the time...all the hand ringing about air pollution and theres trash and brush piles burning big clouds of smoke into the air... AlGore would tax the carbon if he only knew|`|fp9bOiVFaa	They don't necessarily have to burn them. Chipping them in a wood chipper would also get rid of them and would have usable mulch afterward. The only time where burning is necessary is if it's a species of tree that may have a contagious infection or insect infestation (like mountain pine beetle). I would talk to the city.
nM7xmhgiaa	It is just rock salt. It is formed by volcanic action on old, buried sea salt deposits. It has a characteristic hydrogen sulphide smell.<br>  It is not renewable. Since it is basically only sodium chloride it is not of much account.
