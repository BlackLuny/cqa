Also, since you are teaching forgiveness by faith and not by deeds alone the religious people hate you.

Mankind still wants to ignore Jesus and pass Him off as a mere man/prophet/fake/fairytale as they did back then.  <br>   <br>  Original man was perfect and in a loving friendship with God, the creator, but man chose to disbelieve God and go his own way.  God knows that according to spiritual law, this is both physical and spiritual death (eternal separation from God), so He sent Christ to pay our penalty for us, whether we accept it or not. <br>  <br>  He took our punishment for us because He knew that death had no hold over Him (because Jesus is God Himself) and He wouldn't remain dead as we would.

Like, if Jesus forgave them for not believing surely no one will end up in hell?  Yes, Jesus forgave them for their ignorance and rage at killing him.  Those that participated or did not participate in saving him were forgiven.  It was his mission to forgive and to show love.  I would even say that if all were forgiven for everything in their life they had plenty of time to go back to old ways and enter their reward accordingly.  Regardless no one will enter Hell because they killed Jesus their lives and what they do with the knowledge given will decide their fate.|`|yPy4gFZ9aa	well wouldnt u mock a guy too if he said he could wake up the dead???|`|gW0nD5cEaa	That is the whole point.

For that matter, they only referred to the "creation" of individuals, not the rest of the universe.  Since every human being must physically be assembled at a molecular level, one can refer to that fact as a particular "creation", but it is hardly a scientific assertion about the nature of the universe.

So ask yourself, what was the intention behind using the word "Creator"? The founding fathers could have just as easily said "GOD" or "The Lord Christ Jesus" but they didn't. They specifically chose the word  "creator" so that people could apply their own understanding, definition or BELIEF of what a "creator" is. For me that's dear old mum and dad.

The Declaration of Independence is just that- a declaration to the world by the colonies that they are free from Britain.  <br>  The Constitution, on the other hand (keep in mind this is different from the Declaration of Independence!) is the governmental system of rules, principles, and values on which this country operates.  It's in the Constitution that we find what it means to be American.<br>  <br>  The Establishment Clause in the first amendment to the Constitution says this country protects equal treatment of both religion and irreligion under the law, and for those who choose to be religious, they are guaranteed equality no matter what their faith is.  In the clause is also a guarantee of the separation of church and state.  No belief system, whatever it is, can claim this country as its own.<br>  <br>  Lastly, Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, and he was a deist.  If the Declaration of Independence is your only rubric for defining what it means to be "American", you are still no more "American" than Buddhists, Muslims, Atheists, etc., because what Jefferson meant by "God" is something entirely different than what you want it to mean.<br>  <br>  <br>  I say this in the most polite, but serious way possible, and I'll be blunt:  <br>  You are extremely ignorant.

The word "Dahaha" is a multiple meaning word. And one of its meanings is INDEED "Egg shaped". There is no lying in this matter.<br>  <br>  The word Dahaha, also means "Flat". <br>  <br>  The Quran has many verses that have multiple meanings and use multiple meaning words. That is one reason that many verses will get deciphered ONLY at their appointed time. The Quran was revealed 1400 years ago. And people of Arabian peninsula could NOT even imagine that the Earth is anything besides being "Flat". <br>  <br>  Now with the DELIBERATE use of a multiple meaning word "Dahaha", God satisfied the people of ALL times i.e. it was acceptable to the wild people of Arabia of those times AND it was meaningful to the advanced people of later generations. One can imagine, what trouble this verse could have bring to Mohammad, if God had NOT used a multiple meaning word like "Dahaha" and used a FIRM word for Egg shaped.<br>  <br>  <br>  @Edit to Asker<br>  If you are really looking for Miracles, then look for "Miracle 19".<br>  <br>  It is most assuredly the BIGGEST miracle in the history of mankind.

C8Djjxqkaa	Just because man can perform evil it doesn't mean he will. Human rights, animal welfare and conservation of species are increasingly popular issues. Technology is not the trigger which will cause changes in attitude to reverse policies in place. But yes, people do talk a lot of nonsense sometimes.|`|nYjVW8Fbaa	the new slave trade is working for a large corporation|`|s8QCmxnlaa	i agree
iPNOVR6Gaa	I live in Georgia, and I agree that there is prejudice against we Southerners.  I partly blame Hollywood.  In any movie where they want to get across the point that someone is ignorant, they give the character a southern accent.<br>  <br>  But this prejudice, like all prejudices, says more about the ignorance of the prejudiced person than anything else.|`|30b80549ef581ba10302258d8ca2bfbaaa	yeah well i dont think that of the south but i think there are way more conservatives and republicans there which is why i absolutely refused to go to college there. in some areas there is ethnic diversity but ive been down to visit my family and it seems even more segregated than some places in the north. i cant judge everyone or every place of course because i havent been everywhere.  im not a huge fan of southern accents but i think you should be proud of them because they are part of where you come from. <br>  <br>  its also hot and humid as hell down there lol <br>  <br>  but on a personal basis such as one's personality or intelligence no i dont have any prejudice based on where you come from i guess. at the same time i do think most conservatives and republicans tend to be VERY ignorant and uneducated. : \<br>  <br>  if i just met you  though i wouldnt think "oh southerner...must be dumb" because that would ignorant of me. ive kind of trained myself to get to know people first before i make judgments about them. most people judge others at first impression though and stereotype unfortunately.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	There are prejudices against some southern states like Alabama and Texas. People think those states are full of red-necks and ignorant republicans.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Well, if those people in other states think people from Texas are all just drooling idiots, then that makes them ignorant for wanting to lump individual people all together just to make themselves feel better. I don't think people from the South are any less intelligent and capable then people from the North etc.|`|PvPPivLJaa	There are preconceived notions based on things that happened a long time ago. It's not fair. I understand. But, considering the history, many people think that the South are full of racist, bible-thumping, homophobic, sexist bigots.  I've been to certain parts of the South, but honestly, I wouldn't step foot in rural Southern towns for these very stereotypes. Not important to prove them right or wrong for me, but I will acknowledge that this is a big generalization that isn't fair to the people in the South who are non-judgmental and just good people, in general.
a06606d7461228a230c800a081987bc4aa	Until we get God into our personal lives, our homes and our churches, He will not be welcome in our schools. Let me clarify my statement. So many churches across this country do not preach or believe the whole Bible. Most people pick and choose whatever they like and pitch the rest saying it is not for today. Until we choose to take the Bible at face value - (no twisting meaning to fit our lifestyles) - and live according to God's word to the best of our ability, I see no reason to cry that God is no longer acknowledged in our schools. If people in this country would be willing to put God in his rightful place in their everyday lives, He would soon be recognized in our schools! I am not talking about forcing religion down anyones throat. But I am against forcing the THEORY of evolution down our kid's throat! I believe if kids are forced to learn about evolution, they should also be forced to learn about Creation. Then let them choose which one to believe. Personally, I don't believe in forcing anyone to believe anything! And believe me, you will win no one over to your point of view by coming across as hateful!!|`|qE64aNFhaa	I'm thinking it will never go back to that. People just believe different things. It was inevitable that schools would shy away from that. I believe in the seperation of church and state 100%. That is why they have private christian schools, send your kids there if you feel so strongly about it. That's what is awesome about America, you have those choices. People just need to realize that their opinion and beliefs are just that: THEIR OWN, not anyone elses. People should just let it go, worry about yourself and stop trying to save the world by condemning the people that don't agree with them. <br>    Don't worry I am not an atheist.|`|tcvQwTa5aa	you can't change the world,why try?It is what it is.Don't let everything get under your skin.Life's too short.There's good and bad and alot of gray area in between.People differ greatly on their views on what's good and what's bad.Raise your kids as you wish and do the best you can.When their grown and gone they have to make their own choices and deal with the consequences of those choices,good or bad.|`|54g7pUbfaa	Honestly i hope that there will never be any religion taught in schools. Why? because God made it so that we all had free will right? if we start teaching kids about only one tradition and don't allow them to search for what feels right to them then God will seem as nothing but another controlling parent that wants to control every aspect of your life. children should be free to express them selves and find what fits for them. If in the end we all meet god then great but if someone gives there whole life to God to find not God but a pagan Deity in the end. Well how would you feel about that?|`|io7nHB3Oaa	I'm sure that will get your science test scores up in the Bible Belt. <br>  Here in Massachusetts, where the sodomites can actually marry and a black man is governor we somehow still manage to have the best science education in the country. Go figure.|`|oV0Lux4Maa	I do prefer a country filled with unmarried mothers, HIV sodomites and godless teachers. <br>  <br>  Better then having a hate filled doctrine taught in schools.<br>  <br>  If science is so bad why are you using something created by science to post this question?|`|P6P3oUgdaa	"Look what year's and year's of 'scientific' has got us"<br>  <br>  - Vaccines<br>  - Medicine<br>  - ECG's<br>  - Computers<br>  - Airplanes<br>  - Internet<br>  - Etc|`|FhHklqkhaa	look at how homophobic and hate-filled you are<br>  this is why it's excellent that religion is losing influence and power<br>  atheists are neither uncaring or immoral<br>  plus any person of any sexuality can get HIV<br>  not all lesbians, gays and bis have HIV|`|CuN7dCi2aa	evil atheist heathens eh?|`|TBjIJnWvaa	Bla bla bla blahhhhhh|`|wSYYfBK4aa	I thought God was everywhere.

We must go back to Medieval times.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Your "god" does not belong in, and is unwelcome in, my grandchildren's school.  You try to force him upon them and you and I are gonna fight - and I fight dirty!|`|2Hot9EJiaa	God is God, no matter if it is in a church, or not, so separation of church and state, should not be, because when someone believes in God, they realized God is to be in control in EVERY aspect of their lives- He should even be in charge of the government- like scripture says "And the government will be upon His Shoulders".  However, before God can be "brought" back into the schools, we have to go back even farther then that - actually to the time the King Solomon built the temple, and see what God desires of us as individuals and as a nation. <br>  1 Chronicles 7:14- "IF MY PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLED BY MY NAME, SHALL HUMBLE THEMSELVES AND PRAY AND SEEK MY FACE, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, AND THEN I WILL HEAR FROM HEAVEN, FORGIVE THEIR SINS AND HEAL THEIR LAND."  It does not begin with the secular world,  my friend, it begins with HIS PEOPLE.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	How about people focus on bringing God back into their own personal lives and homes and families...?<br>  <br>  If we can't even do that, how can we expect it to be taught in public schools?<br>  <br>  By the way, there's separation of Church and State for a reason (can anyone say "sharia law"?).  So, let's keep it that way.|`|GQk0UNjfaa	Hopefully not. That would be unconstitutional.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	You mean God isn't powerful enough to get into schools without help?|`|9m2LvlWdaa	Not in Canada. We like our heathen children well-read and educated. Homeschool your spawn if it bothers you.|`|8zelZj3Aaa	The condom replaced the Bible in public schools. If that is not a sign of Godlessness I don't know what is. I believe our current reaction to the separation of church and state is a perversion fostered by secularists. Keeping government out of the religion business is good, amen to that, but keeping religion out of government, our every day comings and goings, is showing itself these days and it "ain't" looking good. The morals of this nation are in a state of decline, and I think we all know "that which is written". As long as the secular liberals control events, it is not likely that God will be allowed back.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Teaching about God begins in the home. If you don't want your kids to learn about evolution, either send them to a religious school that does not teach it, or give them your teachings at home and explain some of the things they learn in school might be different, but there are different views, but these are ours. <br>  <br>  It sounds like maybe you would want your kids in a Christian school or even home schooled. You can not expect Public schools to teach a Christian doctrine. And even if they did, which one, there are so many variations. <br>  <br>  I don't think 'science' is responsible for all the evils in the world, anymore than religion is curing them. Neither is happening, at least all at once. You just have to teach your kids, to the best of your ability what you want them to know. But hopefully, not hatred or intolerance for others.|`|KILFoc6kaa	I am a Christian, and I do not believe God belongs in public schools.  Teach about God in your family and your home, and if you are adamant about it being included in education homeschooling or private schooling.  <br>  <br>  I dont believe in trying to force my religious beliefs on others.<br>  <br>  I plan on homeschooling when my husband and I have children because I believe it will be the best option for us.  So then God will be in our school, but not be forced where it doesn't belong.|`|a6eb6e311bd16dad988d64e4f060d69faa	Wow, you are a funny one. Can you provide any evidence to support the existence of your god above all others? School is a place to learn about the world. Not a place to fling reason to the winds and rely on nothing but faith. leave that in churches. If you want YOUR God in schools then I want every God in schools.|`|AA11620976	If we atheists were as smart as we think we are we should surrender to you guys , give you your Christian Nation . pull up a couple of Lazy -Boys , pop open a couple of cold ones and laugh our collective azzes off as you Christians do what you historically have done best which is to kill each other over who the real Christians are that would get to rule your now legal Christian Nation<br>  Which version of Christianity shall it be ?<br>  LDS?<br>  JWs?<br>  Catholics ?<br>  Quakers ?<br>  Mennonites ?<br>  Hmmmm so many choices|`|lh2H5oSOaa	Just wait.

AA11047076	Nathaneal Kapner is an unfortuante example of what happens when Jews with minimal education get seduced by missionaries and target Jews.  He went to Sabath school?  Proper Jewish education starts from play school and involves going to a Jewish day school until school is finished.  My kids go to a Yeshivah school where a third of the day is involved in Jewish studies (and on a side note the school gets top secular academic results as well.  Since not everything can be achieved, the schools sports programmes tend to loose out).<br>  <br>  Simply put- when somebody with minimal education in something turns zealous towards something else, they often beciome fanatical in putting down whatever it was they didn't understand before.  it helps them to deal with the nagging feelings of guilt they have since they know that they have abandoned everything dear to their families and they need to justify that rejection to themselves.|`|AA10057370	<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Nathanael%20Kapnner">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Nathana...</a><br>  <br>  Maybe these sites will help.|`|PEVkrOVVaa	Once when he was small, he went to a Bar Mitzvah with his father  to a synagogue it was very musty and smelly, and to him it had pallor of death.  He considered it the religion of satan, Jews were taught that Jesus was a criminal, and that jews were blamed for his Crucifixion.  When he read about  Jeuses'suffering on behalf of mankind, he considered it a good religion, whereas in childhood he was told that it was a evil religion.  He considered Judaism evil, therefore turned Christian.|`|8WbfmK5daa	Nathanael Kapner left his home and synagogue to go to college in Los Angeles in 1968. But he forgot about his promise to judaism. It wasn’t until 1970 that one of the Jesus Freaks who were very popular at that time gave him a New Testament. He opened it up and started reading the Gospel of St Matthew. Hewas struck by the “Jewishness” of the writing. And He soon found himself captivated by the person of Jesus Christ!<br>  <br>  He saw that Jeus was a man who rubbed shoulders with the common people. He was a man who taught the people from every-day life experiences. And what Nathanael liked most of all about Him was when He said to the religious leaders, “The harlots and tax collectors go into the kingdom of heaven before you.” This had an important message tp Kapner. He simply found himself falling in love with Jesus Christ!<br>  <br>  He devoured the entire New Testament from cover to cover and could not put it down. He did read about the sufferings of Jesus Christ and it made him cry. And he did read the ‘crazed writings’ of St Paul and knew that there was nothing ‘crazed’ about it at all - but were words of hope and purpose. He said to himself, “Judaism is bankrupt. But the Christian message is full of promise and life.”<br>  <br>  When he finished the last Chapter of the Book of Revelations, now at the age of 21, he got down on his knees, wept, and asked Jesus Christ to forgive all his sins and be his Saviour.<br>  <br>  Soon afterward he met an old pious woman at a Church gathering who came up to him and said, “God has so much for you and so much for you to do.” Like a cryptic oracle, long awaiting its coming, He is just beginning, 37 years later, to see this prophecy come true.|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	There is a phenomenon in Judaism called "self-hating Jews".

Oklahoma has quite a few, Texas some, South Dakota, the Four Corners (NM, CO, AZ, and UT) and California are home to the most.<br>  Whether or not you could live on one would be something to inquire of the Tribal Councils, etc. I don't see why not. Most people want to get OFF the rez, not ON! <br>  You'd have a bit of a commute over some lousy roads to get to the nearest school, however.<br>  The website I've included below also has a link to a listing of tribal contact points with phone #s.|`|AA10923010	What is your catch?|`|4vvq8BHGaa	There a couple in Connecticut, and yes, you can live on one.

They're just like regular towns.
AAgX0SDcaa	Nope. I think the legislators are already rubbing their hands together and figuring out where it will go. We will pay our share of taxes so might as well take it. There are many poor people in the state of Oklahoma, and we have regular disasters here like floods, ice storms and tornadoes. It will help in many ways, especially rebuilding bridges. Oklahoma has the worst bridges in the nation, many got in bad shape during the oil boom of the late-70's/early80's,the oil trucks and equipment trucks wore them out and the roads, too,  and they were not taken care of. We had 77 country commissioners go to prison for corruption back then, if they all had managed the money right, we would have had many more good bridges here.|`|ku2tP4eEaa	There are many that insist on keeping polar, in fact widening the gap.  Something is very very wrong with America when some of these elected officials ignore those that elected them for party ideology.  Until it is time to vote, we the people are helpless.

I hope that none of that money will be used as a diluted stimulant  like, the restoration of our recently destroyed Governors Mansion, or some other project that will improve our Texas economy in a long and drawn-out fashion. We,in Texas, do not need a vitamin pill for our economy.  We need a big hot cup of strong coffee for our economy.  We don't care for caffeine free coffee either. The Texas economy is in better shape than it is in many states so we can afford to look at the mouth of this gift horse. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth may not always be the best idea.  I have seen federal and state programs have so many strings attached that you are sometimes wise to just  pass.|`|KWwW7N49aa	Nope.  Our Governor is taking the money.  He would used  it to supplement the state's public education budget over the next two years. Of that, $329 million would be used to cover growing teachers retirement costs.  He also proposes to allow a 5-percent increase in community college funding.  He decided to abandon the layoffs of 700 workers.  At least that is 700 less people in the unemployment line.<br>  <br>  Those (mostly Republicans) that reject the idea are upset because they can't use the money to help their state's deficit among other things. I am glad I don't live in those states either.  Let's at least see how it pans out even if their points are well-taken.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Pompous, indeed. Those governors should spend some time at the employment agencies and the homeless shelters.<br>  <br>  Yesterday the governor of my state said she will accept what we are offered, as well as happily accept any money from any other state if they don't want it.

He knows the truth, and in his Word, the Bible, he explains the condition of the dead. Its clear teaching is this: When a person dies, he ceases to exist. Death is the opposite of life. The dead do not see or hear or think. Not even one part of us survives the death of the body. We do not possess an immortal soul or spirit.<br>  <br>   After Solomon observed that the living know that they will die, he wrote: “As for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all.” He then enlarged on that basic truth by saying that the dead can neither love nor hate and that “there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in [the grave].” (Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6,?10) Similarly, Psalm 146:4 says that when a man dies, “his thoughts do perish.” We are mortal and do not survive the death of our body. The life we enjoy is like the flame of a candle. When the flame is put out, it does not go anywhere. It is simply gone.<br>  <br>  The site www.watchtower.org even offeres free home bible studies in your area using the book this info came from.|`|q0LMxKcjaa	Let me begin with a Bible verse I learned in elementary school.  I'm currently 53 and back then it was fine to learn the Bible in school.  If we memorized this verse, we got a little New Testament of the Bible.<br>  "For God so loved the world, (that's YOU) that He gave His one and only Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life." John 3:16  And verse 17 says, "For God did NOTsend His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him, might be saved.<br>  <br>  In the beginning, when God created Adam and Eve, he told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.  But the serpent (SATAN) tempted Eve.  He got her to doubt what God said, and so she DISOBEYED GOD...and sinned by eating the fruit God told them not to eat.  This is when sin entered all of mankind.  The Bible says, "For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God."  We are ALL sinners.  But you see....God knows everything...He knew in the very beginning that Adam and Eve would choose to sin, but God made a way to redeem us, through His Son, Jesus.  <br>  <br>  The Bible also says that the "wages of (or penalty for) sin is death....BUT the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Our penalty for sin is death...but God loves us so much that He gave His Son as our sacrifice...Jesus took our place...paid our penalty for sin.  Jesus died on a cross, after being beaten, beard plucked out, spit on...but he rose again on the third day..just like the Bible said He would.  He defeated Satan, death , hell and the grave!  Jesus is God in the flesh.  Jesus willingly came to this earth to take on a human body to allow mankind to see who God is...how much He loves us.   God could have made us like robots and MAKE us love him....but He wanted us to CHOOSE TO LOVE HIM.<br>  <br>  When Adam and Eve chose to sin, that perfect relationship with God that they had was broken....sin broke that fellowship...the spiritual part of man died that day.  But when you confess that you are a sinner, ask God to forgive you for your sins, believe that Jesus is God's Son, and that He took YOUR PLACE on the cross...paid your penalty for yor sin, and ask Jesus to come into your heart and life and be your Lord and Savior...you WILL BE SAVED.  That spiritual relationship...your total relationship with God is restored.  The Bible says God adopts us into His family.  He gives us His Holy Spirit to live inside us....to guide us, direct our lives, give us comfort, convict us when we sin,  He helps us to understand the Bible when we read it.....He is God living inside of us.  We CANNOT LIVE A CHRISTIAN life without the Holy Spirit...we cannot do it on our own ... it's impossible without Him .<br>  <br>  And dear one..when you do this HEAVEN WILL be your home..the Bible says, "to be absent from this body is to be present with the Lord."  As a Christian,  we still sin....we don't want to..we strive through the Holy Spirit's help to live godly lives, but there are many many times we still sin.  The difference is we don't want to..we want to live lives pleasing to God, and by reading your  Bible, God will instruct you in righteous living.  But when you sin, ask God's forgiveness and repent (or turn) from those sins.  Don't keep repeating something you know is sin.  When we confess our sins the Bible says that God is "faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us of ALL OUR UNRIGHTEOUSNESS."  But if you choose to reject Jesus and what he has done for you...then you choose Hell...it is a real place of fire and brimstone...the Bible says there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth...torment forever and forever.  God doesn't send you there...you choose it by rejecting His Son.  God has provided a way back to fellowship with Him...but you must accept His Son.<br>  <br>  Get a New Living Translation (NLT) Bible.  It is so easy to understand yet true to the original Greek text.  I have been a Christian for over 30 years.  There are valleys and mountaintops,  good times, times you won't feel God's presence in your life and wonder where is He?  But it won't be Him who has moved it will be you.  You will put other things before your relationship with the Lord and you will be miserable.  The best thing that you can do is to find a Bible believing church...with a wonderful youth group, a great Sunday School.....and be sure to get a Bible.  Your relationship with the Lord with grow...He loves you so much.  The Bible says His thoughts about you are more than the grains of sand in the sea.      God Bless....|`|hYZIYla0aa	Your body dies,not your soul.Those who truly believe in God and try their hardest to do what God wants them to do,will be by his side,Those who do not believe are condemned to hell.|`|cCd8L2PGaa	I have no idea.

9p2wQ21Aaa	Muslim scholars regard Paul as having distorted Jesus' true teaching. Ibn Taymiyya (d 1328) wrote that Paul constructed “a religion from two religions - from the religion of the monotheistic prophets and from that of idolaters” (Michel 1084, 346). Muslims, who firmly reject the deification of Jesus, sometimes put the blame on Paul for what they see as this Christian deviation, one that is condemned in the Qur'an. Thus, Bawany (1977) writes that “due to Paul, Jesus acquired a dual personality and became both God and Man” (187). Rahim (1977) says that Paul produced a mixture of Jewish Unitarianism and pagan philosophy. He “knew that he was lying” but believed that the end justified the means (71). In this process, “Jesus was deified and the words of Plato were put into his sacred mouth” (72). Real Christianity was represented by Barnabas (Paul's one time companion, see Acts 13:1) who later split from him (Acts 16:39). Many Muslims believe that a text called the Gospel of Barnabas is the authentic injil, or Gospel. Rahim says that Barnabas, not Paul, “endeavored to hold to the pure teaching of Jesus” (51).<br>  <br>  <br>  Among Jews, the opinion is widely held that Paul "invented" Christianity by combining the sectarian Judaism of Jesus and his Jewish followers with Hellenistic religious ideas. They see Paul as an apostate from Judaism. While the teachings of Jesus the Jew may be the basis of Christian ethics, they view Paul's teachings as the basis of those Christian beliefs that separate it from Judaism, notably the atoning death of Jesus and the concept of original sin.|`|d3a0051575f0ca9e98fa14121e4cf6e8aa	You don't see it. What you do see is Christ, already knowing His fate. As far as the disciples, we don't see it until after the Crucifixion. What ever took place at the Crucifixion caused the disciples to change. We see them laying their life down for their faith. Before, they were as typical as any other human. Wanting proof, wanting to be first, wanting revenge, arguing etc. But after the killing of Jesus, something seemed to have caused a change in them. Of course, you may not like this answer.|`|uAMzmAwaaa	acts 1 says that Jesus told them to wait for the holy spirit (which is why they waited so long to give their message) and they never said Jesus' crucifixion was ever "Good News for mankind" but rather, his resurrection.|`|fz8PCFRgaa	I think you are looking for a specific scripture that says, "And the Holy Spirit said to Peter and the others the crucifixion is Good News."  Of course it does not say that but it does say as you  know in Acts 2 that the Holy Spirit came upon them.  Then in 2.22-24 Peter talks about the Crucifixion and resurrection.  <br>  <br>  We have to talk the scriptures in total, the last supper, the three times Jesus told the disciples he would be betrayed etc, and the discussions in John in the speeches Jesus makes to his disciples.  One must bring meaning out of the scriptures in an educated way rather than take them literally and look for specific words.  <br>  <br>  I think you are looking for loopholes.|`|hVVALFAPaa	I am not quite sure what you are asking but here is an answer to the question I THINK you are asking....<br>  <br>  During the time Jesus spent here bodily on earth, the disciples knew that the Crucifixion was good news but they really didn't understand it. They knew He would die, they knew He would come again, but did not get how or why.<br>  <br>  It wasn't until a few days later when Jesus reappeared to them on the road to Gethsemane that they 'got it.' John 24:46 says Jesus explained it to them at that point. Right then they knew that He had died and gone to Heaven. If He could go to Heaven, as a human, then all people would be able to go to Heaven upon their death. (Remember, up to this point, Heaven was reserved for God, but if the human Jesus got to go to Heaven, then the rest of us humans could go too.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Are you saying God wasn't going to save His Messiah from horrific death?<br>  <br>  Good grief.

I will say this that if you follow the teachings of Jesus you will be fine, but only if you believe he was the son of God and died for your sins.  John 3:16 should ring a bell and I do believe he was a real Apostle.  What about Jesus saying strike the temple down and I will rebuild it in three days?  Or "no sign but that of Jonah will be given..."  I think there is ample proof of a blood doctrine especially when you read Jesus Passover account and the instating of Communion.  I am sure the kid take on the Bible is cute and even insightful, but the men and women who knew Jesus and wrote what became the Bible shows clearly that the sacrificial system, a blood system, is met in Jesus.  If it makes you feel better you can just simple believe that it was his sacrifice that made the difference and not the actual blood.  I know that it was his gift that cleanses me and the Baptism of water was an evidence of it.  My walk is proof.

KkRl6Sfraa	it's very important to consider where you want to work (or in what kind of community). Scandinavian languages are very difficult to learn but great if you are GOING to Scandinavia or will be translating for a company with scandinavian clients. Likewise, German is great for Switzerland and Austria as well as German, or spanish in South America as well as spain. That should largely affect your decision. Spanish and French are a great start in terms of  easy to learn, fun languages which are used in many countries. I chose German after those because it is used not only in central europe but in many parts of Eastern Europe. Then I tried Russian which is also great for Ukraine and parts of Eastern Europe. All of these kinds of languages get you credit in academic institutions depending on what your specialty is (e.g. Russian is good for politics and literature, German and French good for theory and European history etc). Alternatively asian languages are great if you want to get into the asian business side of things where there is a lot of money. Really you need to think more about what you want to do and where you want to work (as well as what kinds of languages you like).<br>  <br>  Also try a few short crash courses in swedish, german etc...you might find some suit you better than others. I ended up with german simply because I loved it after going to a class with a friend just for fun one night.|`|YIWAefzUaa	I would go for German, or Italian, because German is very easy to learn, and Italian is very close to Spanish, very close, but if you go to your local or closest to local electronics store, they should have some type of program there to teach you.|`|0Sqp4dzZaa	Dear Mark,<br>  Learn Latin.

rEo5gfO3aa	He is testing  your boundaries. Anyone who tests your boundaries so much is going to do that throughout life. It's a sign that what they want is more important than what you want. It's all about him. I'm also a bit worried he's got a sexual agenda. Personally, I wouldn't get any further involved with him. Trust your instincts.|`|TGFc2Z6Caa	I would be uneasy about him,too, for the way that he takes for granted his right to have you give in to everything he wants.

Since you have only been dating for a short period of time I would definitely let him know the things that make you uncomfortable, if not he is going to assume that this kind of behavior is acceptable with you and over time will just become worse.|`|82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	If it were something like him leaving the lid off the toothpaste or whatever, I'd say get over it. But if his actions are making you uncomfortable, then break it off. Something about his behavior doesn't seem right. I had a boyfriend who was much like this. He kissed me on the first date, and then it was like that's all he wanted to do. He always had his arms around me because he said he wanted everyone to know I was with him. He'd call me "just to hear my voice." Eventually he became possessive and then abusive.

When you look at the different laws and the structure put into place government has had an increased role in the lives of citizens.  In addition to government our society has changed due to the many beliefs that citizens share.  Compared to society in the past where everyone was made to believe one central aspect, we have created an institution where we can believe in different things and still have some sort of unity within our world.

BWt4mj13aa	White.|`|DfDss68haa	Black genes are usually stronger in 50/50 situations but your kid will come out looking more white usually in 75/25 situations.<br>  <br>  My guess: It depends on your appearance and her appearance but the kid will likely have pale to golden skin color.The kid will probably have dark blond to black hair depending on the hair color of the parent. Lighter hair is more likely if you or her have light hair. Also red hair if you have a redhead in one of your families. Your child will most likely have curly hair but they may have naturally straight hair. And as for facial features that depends on you and your girlfriend. Of course all of this is a crapshoot. Your child may come out with dark ebony skin with beautiful kinky curls or looking blonde and blued eyed with pale skin. Or some wonderful combination of the above. For example pale skin, blue eyes and dark brown kinky curly hair. Or caramel skin and loose brown curls. Or dark brown skin and straight blonde hair. Usually hair will be darker than the skin though.

Give a larger gift at the shower that is from all of you as a family. And, since your boyfriend also wants to give something, but not at the shower, then he can still give a gift separately later, and it wouldn't be linked to the baby shower. I think the main reason why I would do this is because you have kids together, and this way it doesn't seem strange that it is just from you or just from you and the kids. I know this may cost a little more, but it seems the best way to meet everyone's needs, unless he is completely against having his name on the tag. I would work to reassure him that that wouldn't stop him from giving another gift himself too. Baby showers are usually only for the first baby of a family, so everyone's feelings must be considered, because there probably won't be another chance. It might be worth the extra expense for you to feel comfortable at the shower, for your boyfriend to feel he can give what/when he desires also, and for his cousin to feel well taken care of at the shower and afterwords. Keeping family peace can really be worth it in the long run.

Just because you dealt with the legal aspects of your marriage in marrying and divorcing under civil law, it doesn't mean that it invalidated the union.

If you both were of sound mind/maturity and consciously and fully committed to each other when you married and there were no impediments to that commitment - then you are STILL married regardless of a civil divorce.

Great crowds followed him, and he cured them there.  Some Pharisees approached him, and tested him, saying, 'Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause whatever?'  He said in reply, "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female' and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and become joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'?  So they are no longer two, but one flesh.  Therefore, what God has joined together, no human being must separate."  They said to him, "Then why did Moses command that the man give the woman a bill of divorce and dismiss [her]?"  He said to them, "Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.  I say to you, whoever divorces his wife(unless the marriage is unlawful) and marries another commits adultery."  [His] disciples said to him, "If  that is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry."  He answered, "Not all can accept [this] word, but only those to whom that is granted.  Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so; some, because they were made so by others; some, because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.  Whoever can accept this ought to accept it." <br>  <br>  So yes, it is unlawful to live with him and to divorce him.|`|PM9MQHjRaa	I do not know, but I do know it would be a sin for you to marry another man, so it would be better for the two of you to remarry.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	No.|`|ZTPCOiJlaa	That depends, Did you sleep with someone else inbetween?

Helps immensly if you get your bible and actually read it for yourself! <br>  <br>  “Let Them Marry”<br>  <br>  The Bible gives the best reason for couples not to live together without marriage. “Let marriage be honorable among all, and the marriage bed be without defilement, for God will judge fornicators and adulterers,” states Hebrews 13:4. The Bible plainly and simply says that living together outside of marriage is fornication. Just what is meant by “fornication”? One dictionary describes it as “human sexual intercourse other than between a man and his wife.” For us to have a good conscience, this Bible counsel must be followed: ‘God wills that you abstain from fornication.’—1?Thessalonians 4:3.<br>  <br>  But suppose some have a problem with restraining their sexual impulses? The apostle Paul wrote: “If they do not have self-control, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to be inflamed with passion.” And again: “But if anyone thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virginity, .?.?. let them marry.” (1?Corinthians 7:9,?36) Note that Paul did not say to ‘do what they want and move in together’ but, “Let them marry.”<br>  <br>  Not that marriage should be viewed only as a means to satisfy sexual desires. Couples should get to know each other before they marry. But how can you do so unless you live together? An honorable courtship provides ample opportunity for that. You should determine what you expect of marriage and of your mate. What are your physical, emotional, and spiritual needs? Will the person you have in mind as a possible mate help you fill them?—Matthew 5:3.<br>  <br>  After considering the above, you will no doubt agree that of the two courses—living together or marrying—the latter is better. Couples living together in marriage do so without guilt or fear, and they enjoy the respect of friends and relatives. Their children will bear no emotional scars for having been born out of wedlock. And most important, such couples please God by showing respect for his arrangement of marriage.<br>  <br>  For more awesome info from the scriptures and God's view on matters go to www.watchtower.org.|`|54g7pUbfaa	Why does it matter what anyone thinks the bible was written by man not by the hand of god.

If the parents will not explain the situation, then it would be beneficial for the children's school teacher to bring in PWDs to interact with the children and let the children to ask the PWDs questions about their Disabilities including questions about the CBBC presenter.|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	Have just a minute ago asked a similar question, if it scares their children they just need to explain that some people aren't as lucky as them and are different, as you say, a simple explanation at that age will suffice, all the complaining does is show their ignorance.|`|5tsyS7Kpaa	When I first read about this I genuinely felt ill! We appeared to have made so much progress towards accepting people with handicaps or disfigurements in to our normal lives and then we get these senseless comments. I would like to see presenters chosen for their presenting skills and ignoring physical appearances.|`|AA12398803	I can not believe that people have complained .<br>  <br>  If these parents do not educate their children this may breed ignorance and this will lead to discrimination .<br>  <br>  These parents really need to get a grip|`|fNgv2FeRaa	If the children came from an well educated family this wouldn't of been an issue.<br>  Parents should teach their children that some people are born different.|`|dsUDIUlHaa	i agree with you there|`|AA10844779	I think it's more likely that the parents are the ones that are scared: "how do we explain to our children that people are different?" It's stupid really, and it's ignorance and prejudice like this that keeps discrimination alive. If a child asks: "mummy, why does that woman only have one hand?", mummy could explain about some people being born like that. I guess it might be harder to explain if the presenter in question had an arm before but lost it in an accident (parents want to protect their children from that harsh part of reality), but she was just born this way so I don't see the problem. <br>  <br>  I knew a guy who had only one arm just like this presenter, and he worked at the same summer camp I worked at. He's a brilliant guy, great with the kids and I never heard any of them say: "he scares me, he's weird because he's only got one arm." So I'm really convinced it's the parents overreacting rather than the children really being scared of the new presenter. Children will always ask questions, but they wouldn't be scared just because someone is a bit different. I'll bet most children under the age of three mightn't even notice, and the ones that are three or older will just ask questions.<br>  <br>  These parents should learn to think about the consequences of their actions; what if in a few years, there's a child in their son/daughter's class who has that same disability? If they've now been acting like he/she should be scared of the presenter, he/she will be scared of his/her classmate as well, and then what? Do we really want our children to grow up in a world where they feel they have to be scared of everyone who's not exactly like them?|`|os36Q3P2aa	Hiya <br>  i think your right <br>  <br>   all of my kids watch the cbeebies channel and have picked up on the lady you are talking about . all of them asked  about the lady's arm and i explained.The boys just  said oh ok ..they did ask a few questions out of curiosity .My daughter however doesnt believe me,she thinks the lady is hiding her arm! <br>  I think its good for children to be educated like you said on disabilities etc..kids ask questions regardless dont they  so in my opinion i think   the sooner the better !<br>  i dont think its scary ,and i think  its wrong of people to complain   because she has a disability|`|CHvDjzCuaa	no wonder the chain of prejudice never breaks when we still even listen to this even being discussed. Children are unbelievable tolerant and absorbent - they will mimic fin the main their parents fears and beliefs - so if the parent is well adjusted and accepting, so the child will follow.  My heart goes out to the poor presenter, she was and I hope will continue to do a great job :)|`|1cYPOJkqaa	Would the parents be saying the same thing if it were a child in their child's class? <br>  <br>  They wouldn't say it. You wouldn't complain about her on the street, even though it has the same effect on a child. I know when I was younger, I would have just been curious as to why her arm was different. I don't think it is remotely scary. <br>  <br>  I'm also hoping, that these parents bring up their children to love and respect others. But I'm guessing from this incident, that those children will grow up like some people in my school. They actually pointed and laughed at an amputee. And it was literally "a ha ha ha, he has no leg". And they pointed! These are 16 year olds. They should know better.|`|zZ3Uxllfaa	Some people  have nothing else better to do than  complain or moan  Why don't they take the time to explain Cerries disability to the child  in a way that they can understand , basically it  all comes down to ignorance at the end of the day .i mean whatever next  !!|`|x5MYW2LPaa	That's awful the paretns have that attitude.

If you have control of yourself, your surroundings and your relationships then you can be considered mature. Maturity levels fluctuate throughout a life time for a number of reasons. <br>  <br>  Some men go through mid-life crises where they lose control of themselves and their surroundings and start doing immature things. Women between the ages of 45-55 seem to regress into teenagers with their changing bodies, raging hormones and mood shifts which leads to immature behaviour.<br>  <br>  And of course there are people who never learn self-control and selfrestraint.

Maturity does not necessarily equal common sense and manners,  too bad.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Common sense and good manners have always been earmarks that identified maturity and, they still are. Normally maturity comes through a learning period that takes awhile. Some people never learn and therefor never attain what we call " Maturity ". Some people are quick learners and therefor mature at an early age. Some people need to be prodded to encourage the maturing process.  A wet rope, a leather belt, a willow tree branch and sometimes even a razor strap are teaching tools that, when correctly applied, insure to some degree that, the learning process will be successful and maturity will be assured.  It is normal for some boys to find that learning doesn't come easy so teaching aids, as already mentioned, are more likely to be used. If a boy never needs some stern application of the teaching tools mentioned he either has a very wise Mom and Dad or he lacks spirit. Modern day educators may not agree with me but the proof is in the pudding.<br>     I have never claimed to be a man of few words.

I think Humanism could be considered a religion (in a certain sense).<br>  <br>  Also - Humanism is loosely organized and has several versions of written beliefs.  My favorite is Humanism and It's Aspirations (Humanist Manifesto III).|`|LjsRfaskaa	A religion is an organization. Humanism wont be a religion until it is organized. However organization itself always ends up being evil. Power corrupts and total power corrupts totally. Keep it small and personal and it works. <br>  <br>  Village community life existed perfectly fine before central control was invented. With central control you end up with super elite class who rule everyone like puppeteers. That is not freedom or being humanitarian, it's being a slave. <br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	Religion per se is an organized approach to spirituality. So no, humanism is not a religion anymore than Objectivism or any other non-spiritual philosphy.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	It's not actual worship of humans. Just a human-centric view of our place in the world.<br>  <br>  Many humanists are just nice atheists.|`|yPy4gFZ9aa	nope, humanist need to have brains...|`|XN0cYCATaa	Atheism isn't a Religion ? Hmm I disagree, Proof ? OK, Lets look at the Similarities ok.<br>  <br>   1. CREED <br>  No God, anti God, Pro-homosexuality, anti-Christianity. <br>  Atheism is a belief.  I know that many atheists will disagree with this, but the atheists gathered around a common belief of no God or lack of God and the need to increase what they perceive as separation of church and state in America.<br>   <br>  2.CRISIS<br>  Created a problem and offered a solution.  The problem was religious oppression in society with atheistic ideals as the solution. <br>  Assemblies <br>  Gathered in groups with meeting times.  Now, atheists don't meet nearly as frequently as Christians do in their churches.  But, they do have state meetings, national meetings, and regular gatherings.<br>   <br>  3.PULPIT<br>  The lectern from which speeches were made, their ideas were promoted, and their reasons for their belief system were validated. <br>  <br>  4.Evangelistic<br>   <br>  The atheists sought converts to their cause.  They frequently spoke about getting the idea of atheism out into society, and to move people away from theism. <br>  <br>  5.Celebration over converts <br>  <br>  Rejoiced when converts to their belief system were announced.  There was applause and excitement when there were announcements about people who had "come out of the closet" an announced their atheism. <br>  Zealous for their cause <br>  They wanted their cause and belief system expanded to the extent of changing America to reflect their thinking. <br>  <br>  6.Exclusive <br>  <br>  Only they have the truth.  The atheists repeatedly spoke of how atheism was the truth and that theists and deists were ignorant of facts and reason. <br>  <br>  7. Us against them mentality <br>  <br>  There was a profound description of the division between atheism and theism with the atheists being the ones who were defending themselves against the intrusive theists.  <br>  <br>  8. Concerned about public image <br>  <br>  This is normal.  They were very concerned with how they were perceived and wanted to change their negative reputation. <br>  <br>  9. Lack of critical thinking <br>  <br>  This is common everywhere.  Though they thought they were rational, by far most of the arguments and comments weren't. <br>  <br>  10. Misrepresentation of opposing views <br>  <br>  Again, another common trait among people who gather in groups, have a common ideology, and see others as being less enlightened.<br>   <br>  11. Voting block <br>  <br>  The atheists mentioned voting as a group in order to progress their cause in society.<br>   <br>  12 Infighting <br>  <br>  This is normal for groups.  We don't all see eye to eye.  But, they all held to atheism even though they had disagreements about some particulars.<br>   <br>  13. Money <br>  <br>  They didn't have tithing, but there were plenty of things for sale.  And, let's not   Forget to mention how they sought donations to help cover the costs of promoting atheism, paying speakers, renting facilities, etc. <br>  Now, I'm sure that there are atheists who will debate a few of the issues listed.  But,   I am just rendering my opinion of what I saw.<br>  <br>  I think it rather ironic that those who are against religion so much, are in actuality so religious themselves.  I couldn't help but smile and see the natural tendency of people to gather around an idea, develop a cause, and then promote it.  Unfortunately, the atheists have gathered around non-belief and want that non-belief promoted in society.  All I have to say is, eternity is a long time to be wrong.|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	In order to be considered a religion, it must conform to the definition of religion:<br>  <br>  A systematic set of beliefs, usually in at least one deity.<br>  <br>  What systematic set of beliefs does humanism espouse?|`|AA11058044	It doesn't really have an established dogma, or commonality of belief - but then neither does Unitarianism.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't consider it a religion, but then I don't usually try to fit nice, neat labels on philosophical viewpoints.|`|JQLpNJzuaa	"Humanism"???<br>  <br>  Half-Demons do not recognize "Humanism".<br>  <br>  Solly, Chollie.|`|8gveZWbHaa	It's more organised than atheism (which isn't!), and it does provide rituals to mark the main rites of passage<br>  <br>  But it falls a long way short of a true religion|`|S4XUl7qWaa	It's a philosophy, not a religion.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Such godless approaches to life are philosophies, not religions.|`|FhHklqkhaa	nope|`|832sXgbDaa	I believe the answer depends entirely upon the definition that one uses to describe "religion".  When the definition is used loosely, as some people have described thus far, then one could argue that just about any philosophy might be interpreted as a religion.  However, this approach only reduces religion down to the "feelings" or convictions that people experience over a particular philosophy.  Religion is much deeper than this in the sense that it focuses on the sacred or the holy--as well as those things we fully do not comprehend, yet desperately seek to answer.|`|Z9opXbVOaa	i dont thinnk so. religions have a specific set of beliefs that our supposed to be linked to a higher power. humanism is just people being cocky lol|`|wb6BWbf1aa	No, its not explanatory.|`|P6P3oUgdaa	It's closer to a philosophy.|`|BLnXhWoTaa	doesn't the ethical society consider itself humanist?  they're pretty religious in their behavior.|`|NrjGBiV2aa	Pudding is good, like the chocolate pudding.

929b0210e46cbd96484f7032e99a63afaa	The best response to rudeness is no response at all. If a person can't be civilized, you aren't under any obligation to speak to them. However, if the rude person is your boss (for example) or someone else in a position of authority, limit your interactions with them as much as possible. If "rude" becomes "completely inappropriate" then speak up - gently - and let them know they've crossed a line. But be careful not to go to far, and end up being a rude person yourself!<br>  <br>  Best regards,<br>  Holly :)|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	If it's done at work, I would just give them a stern look and walk away because I know that if I open my mouth, the wrong thing will come out. lol <br>  <br>  If it's a complete stranger, I would tell them off!|`|Rl31QJzQaa	try and insult them with their own words and actions without letting on about being upset. but don't be polite in any way.|`|S52QYabdaa	reply consistantly.  Nip it in the bud each and every time or else you become a wuss.|`|0Sqp4dzZaa	You must remain polite, and no matter how rude it is, say these simple two words: "You're right" It not only makes it a lot easier to talk to the person, it helps to end the argument that didn't even start yet.<br>  -supermattyb|`|Leda2ha0aa	Definitely don't let it pass if someone is blatantly rude to you - AND you know them.  I usually give the stare that lasts a few seconds longer than a normal stare.  That usually gives them the picture they are out of bounds.<br>  <br>  If it is a stranger, you have to watch what is said or done these days because you don't know what kind of whacko you're dealing with.  Sometimes in this case it's better to just go on your way and not do anything.|`|rThIVk2maa	An icy look and some vague non-answer are usually good. For example, phrases such as "how kind of you to take an interest" or "Thank you for pointing that out." followed by silence are both polite and translate to "how dare you." (also a good phrase for extreme rudeness).

stAeoUeSaa	True Time vs. False Time<br>  <br>  Time is fractal in nature. It repeats itself in definite and regular patterns. That is why some prophecies can have double and even triple reference. You have probably heard the wise ole maxim: “history always repeats itself”. There’s more truth to that than you may know!<br>  <br>  False time ('Satanic Calendar') is the 13:20 ratio of the Tzolkin long count of 5,125 years broken down into 13 baktuns of 144,000 days each. This count only runs from right before the Great Flood til the 'abomination of desolation' (winter solstice 2012). It was given to the bloody Mayan pagans by Pacal Votan. Other parts of the world received it by meduimship, spirit conjuring, and divination like the Chinese I-ching for example.<br>  <br>  True Time is a dispensation of 7777 years that started back in 4762 BC. Joseph Scaliger came VERY close to this with his "Julian Period" in the 16th century. We add 4762 to negative BC dates to get thier True Time date and add 4761 (since there is no zero in our Gregorian calendar) to all AD dates. The 7777 years can be divided into 7 periods of 1111 years. 1111 whispers out in many ways to all ready for True Time understanding and no it is not a coincidence. It can also be broken down into 11 periods of 707 years. These are the 11 'weeks' of mankind's history referred to in the book of Enoch.<br>  <br>  The Tribulation will be from summer 6770pc - summer 6777pc (summer 2009AD - summer 2016AD). [pc = 'post creation']<br>  The midpoint of the Tribulation is December 21, 2012 (2012 is the Year of the Dragon)<br>  The most wise prophet Daniel showed us that we can also find the beginning if we just subtract 1260 days from that evil date and find the end if we just add 1260 days to it.<br>  <br>  The Millennial Age will be from 6777pc - 7777pc (2016AD-3016AD)<br>  <br>  The square root of 1111 has a VERY SPECIAL meaning as well!|`|5ac2dCxJaa	Yeah, I don't get it either but the same happened to me and I said something about it to my girlfriend and sure enough she was experiencing it to. I looked it up online thinking it was just some oddity that we had noticed, but apparently so are a lot of other people. Can't explain it but it is happening to a lot of others.|`|1qKvCldEaa	Your body has an internal clock that you are unconscious of. So you will unconsciously look at the clock as specific times. Also you may look at the clock often but only recall seeing certain numbers. For instance 11:11 and 8:13 are more significant to you than 2:55. I would say there's definitely psychological and coincidental factors involved. However who knows, it could really mean something. There are a lot of unexplained communications in the world, like, do you ever just instinctively look in a direction for no particular reason to find someone staring at you?|`|d3VV4b6vaa	its an angelic number; read this:<br>  <a href="http://www.1111angels.net/content/view/11/25/" rel="nofollow">http://www.1111angels.net/content/view/1...</a>

There's no getting it back.  <br>  <br>  Allow yourself a few more years to become a full fledged adult - settle into your life's plan - establish your direction and path.  Once you are better able to define who you are, *and* be happy with yourself for who you are - then you will find it easier to find companionship.<br>  <br>  This doesn't relate to *just* spiritually - you're in college yes?  So, it's not like you're in the position to get married and support a family right now anyway.  Perhaps try looking for just friends to share common interests/beliefs and activities with instead of going with the attitude that you're sick of being single and want a woman in your life.  Put yourself in the position to meet people who would be compatable with you.

You didn't choose it, every trait you have is inherited from your parent's and your ancestors' genes.<br>  <br>  People are against it because the people who made the bible were homophobic, and they poured their homophobia into the story of god and have created a world where people are brainwashed from a young age that homosexuals are dirty perverts that they are going to burn in hell.

First, what is normal? Are you normal? The base is this, I believe, (correct me if I'm wrong): Normal is what is considered to fit within the social and logical perceptions of the time and place in which the person, event or object is being judged. Right? I guess. So, your perception of normality is completely determined by the randomness of time and space in which you happened to be alive. Which means you are making a judgment (believing it is yours) based on circumstances that are not yours, that you didn't choose; you did not decide about having that patron of judgment or not. You are then, a product, as simple as that, a product of all the circumstances that have been surrounding your life; since your genetic construction. So, how can you judge someone for being normal or not? If that person did not stick to what society of that place and time expected him to be or do, then it is judged as abnormal, not outstanding. So, who is wrong, me or the time and space?<br>  Just remember either you agree with me or not, that "abnormal persons" are the ones that are remembered; the ones that stay, at least for a moment, into the global memory. Those persons reinvent, think and create, do not go with the flow; they determined eras, ideology and creative periods; they make revolutions, they change what they do not like, they do not resign with the laws of life and behavior that most of the people around them try to obey. So, you decide: to continue being what you believe as "normal" or to construct your own basis under your analysis of everything that surrounds you, deciding to adopt only what you really like and makes you feel complete. But what ever you do, I just ask you this favor: leave people alone and live your own life without judging.|`|i8yanqUAaa	Because of their education, because they don't like to think for themselves...<br>  These two are the main reasons.<br>  If you don't think you'll be brainwashed and there'll be nothing more you'll accept than what you hear from most people.<br>  Some religious people say that the bible says it's a bad thing.<br>  Some other religious people say it's bad because nature has made us the way to reproduce ourselves (which is no good argument since nature also made those who won't reproduce themselves because of their stuff, bi,homo,a, or whatever..... all exist in nature.)|`|1d2ac090a275a852a184a7419a0bae8faa	I don't think sexuality has much to do with choice.

But even the day of can work if you go and get it from them early in the day. As for where you can do this talk to the homeless shelter, you could do something special for mothers with children or just everybody. But before you do any of that you need to see how much food the grocery stores will give you to do these dinners. If you talk to them about it like a month before you start doing this then you will be able to know how much food you an get and do the rest of the preparations for these meals.|`|X8riDZBqaa	Don't throw out the food from the restaraunt you normally would.

flV8NKruaa	I really don't understand what you mean by mixed race.  We are all human.  If you mean ethnicity, then they are all of European ancestry.<br>  If you mean, native people who can be traced back to the original tribe that first set foot on the island of England, then who would know, the first tribes of humans to migrate from Africa or wherever was so long ago that any trace of them would be lost.<br>  <br>  In all honesty, the difference between a native Englishman and an Anglo Saxon is like telling the difference between a Japanese man and a Korean man.  There really is no genetic difference.  In fact, there is very little genetic difference between all ethnic groups of people. All people on earth are 99.999999% similar.  With millions of genes, to only have a few hundred that are different means that we are virtually identical, regardless of where we were born or the color of our skin.|`|eskZfVBkaa	I think the original people were the celts (although i might be wrong) and tbh there is no way of knowing who is who anymore.

So, the next person you see in an English street could indeed be directly descended from someone who built Stonehenge!<br>      The 'purest' in terms of ancient heritage in England would probably be in Cornwall, which is considered a celtic region, and in tests had a very strong dna match to the Basque region of Spain. You'll noticed a lot of darker hair and eyes in that area too.<br>     *the stone age skeleton known as cheddar man was dna tested a few years back,and they found a match for his mtdna in the local village. The direct descendant would have been related to Cheddar Man through the man's sister.<br>     *it looks like many of the oldest people in Britain,including England, came from Northern Spain after the Ice age. Later neolithic farmers arrived bringing agriculture;ultimately they had come from the near and middle east but had travelled over centuries along the western seaboard -Portugal,Spain, France, even on up to Norway--periodically crossing to the British Isles to settle.<br>   *There's a fair bit of viking ancestry in the English,esp. in certain areas but Norman is harder to tell-again, it was more of an aristocracy thing (many of the titled people of today descend from Normans) Genetically it's hard to tell them apart as Normans are just recycled vikings!)<br>   *Roman dna is also difficult to pinpoint because 'Roman' referred to anyone under the rule of the Empire--a Roman could be Spanish,German, African. There were certainly not all italian. When we refer to the romano-British we're mainly talking about native British who had become Romanised in dress,some aspects of religion, manners and even Latin speaking.

It depends how much you are shorter than her if she is 4.5 or 4.6 this is normal bbut if she is 5.5 for example I dont think she will be comfortable specially that women like to wear high heal .|`|DpLsRUzwaa	iluvmeuh8teu, I know you said you're not "discriminated" but your reasons for not wanting to date short guys are pretty strange.  In this day, 2009, you're looking for a guy based on how well he can fight?  Seriously?  If your boyfriend gets his "a s s kicked" as you say, would you then belong to the guy who beat him up?  Will he drag you into his cave by your hair?|`|8PmgWto5aa	No, not attracted to that sorry. I'm not discriminated but I don't need some short man in my life. He need a big strong to protect.

Almost EVERY girl I meet is taller than I am.  <br>  <br>  Oh well, sucks to be them, because I'm a really nice, sweet, respectful, and funny guy.  I"m not the kind of guy that's going to get you knocked up and then forget you exist 3 months later.

They generally grow as the Latino population in the U.S. grows (they follow where the money is). Look at California and Miami. It has already(third world country) begun.

iPNOVR6Gaa	What I don't understand is why it seems like these days people have to go all the way from being single to being exclusive in one giant leap.  People don't date around anymore?  You can't just date and hang out for awhile with one or two or more people until you get close enough to one to know that being exclusive with that one is what you want?  To me, this has far less to do with sexual orientation than it does with how you view when to become exclusive in new relationships.|`|uBkvqcY6aa	She's the reason why people think Bi people are greedy.

GOD created Adam and Eve. GOD intended for you to marry a man that HE chooses for you and continue with carrying on the creation of human life as HE sees fit. You are no lesbian by any means, except by your own choice. Choosing this lifestyle, you also choose to turn your back on HIM. We are living in the end times right now. Maybe you should open up your Holy Bible and read just what GOD says about that lifestyle. Start in the book of Leviticus and pay very close attention to chapter 18 verse 22. It is written in plain old everyday English. Cofusion begins when one is confused about truth, before becoming confused over lies. GOD's truth is absolute truth. For example, isn't it absolutely true that you asked this question over the internet. Your "bi-sexual" female friend is also confused, which is why she fails to believe in the fact that she is too timing her male friend with you. Finally, since you are all still in school, are worried about a relationship instead of studying to earn yourselves good grades, and still young; all of you are confused about entering adulthood. Each and all 3 of you should be trying to get yourselves the highest education that you can achieve. Why?.....Because everything you own can be taken away from you, except the superior education that you all deserve to obtain, so that you can all earn yourselves a good living without help from anyone else to include your families. With the entire world in a financial bind right now; your education is most important for all 3 of you.....even more important than any relationship. Stop the confusion, return to GOD through the acceptance of HIS Son; our Lord, Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ. Get the highest education that you can and stop worrying over a relationship until the education is finished. You will never stop learning; even after you pass from this life.|`|fYvFtFG0aa	wow, that sucks. well i think you need to talk it through with her a bit more. by the phone conversation it sounds like she was a bit gutted when you kinda made the point about it not going any further. maybe you should tell her that you still want her, but that you're not willing to be with her if she's with someone else, male or female. if she wants to be with you, that's how it's gonna have to be, and if not, you're sorry it didn't work out. i mean you might not get the outcome you would have liked, but at least that way you'll know if she really likes you. hope stuff works out for you though xXx

We have 1 Holy Spirit, a reflection of God's power, that works in our lives to teach us.<br>  <br>  However, there are many other spiritual forces that can influence our thinking and trick us. If we're not trained to discern the difference between those spirits and the Holy Spirit, people can adopt beliefs that contradict the objective reality of His teaching and Word.<br>  <br>  So the one that's right is the one that God knows and says is right...but for us as humans to know, we have to do our best and exercise careful discernment, critical thinking and comprehensive study. And we won't even be perfect then. But we at least have a lithmus test...<br>  <br>  As has been mentioned by other posters, part of the problem relates to different levels of spiritual maturity.

One person quotes the bible as does another yet they completely disagree.  Then you just start a different church on your own.  This is the Protestant way.  You can see nothing gets accomplished.  Is the Holy Spirit really doing its job leading people into more and more confusion?  Or is the Holy Spirit making mistakes?  There is no one to determine who is right is there?  Everyone makes himself their own Pope this way.<br>  This is why the Catholic position makes the most sense in all of this mess.  Jesus established the church and said that He would be with it until the end of the age and guide the church in all truth. Catholics take Jesus at his word.  The Catholic church was the one Jesus founded and is being led by the Holy Spirit since the beginning.  The other Protestant churches do contain much truth when they follow Jesus but are not in fullest union with God as they could be.<br>  <br>  How is this not proof the Catholic church is right?|`|z74a7wvlaa	If you are member to that one of the 40k protestants ministries, then you have 40k holy spirit versions.

I will tell you a personal story and hope it helps. I am a musician and quite a few years ago, I had the "sense" that the Holy Spirit was leading me to not work on a sunday morning.  It took me a little while to actually realize that He was telling me this.  Does that mean that everyone who is a Christian should never work on a sunday morning?  Of course not- what may be in the will of God for one person may not in another.  We cannot judge what God's will is in "disputable" matters, such as meat eating and working on sunday's.  What we can judge on is what God ultimately says is right and wrong for everyone.  For instance, when someone is sinning against God , by saying something like " God told me leave my spouse for another person".  That would be wrong and it would not be the Holy Spirit at all. We have to be sure it is Him truly speaking- and that what He says  would never go against scripture.|`|TzY9vkinaa	Whichever one doesn't contradict the word of God.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The word of God as told by all prophets and Jesus Christ.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Protestant View: <br>  <br>  A TIE, there can't be any central authority so there is no one to say that person A is wrong and person B is right. You can't rely on Tradition nor what any man says, because that would be putting either of those before God.<br>  BOTH individuals rely on fallible knowledge of the bible.  BOTH are supposedly inspired by the Holy Spirit to correctly interpret the bible IF they have accepted Christ and pray to God that he will help them to interpret the bible correctly. Therefore, neither person can call the other's interpretation as heresy, if that person is a christian and prayed to the holy spirit. <br>  At MOST they merely agree to disagree and move on.  They have NO way to reconcile doctrinal or interpretational differences.  This most likely explains the incredible number of Protestant churches around today.  When there is a difference, you can't resolve it, therefore you SPLIT over it.<br>  <br>  Differences MAY be resolved by ensuring that both views are consistent with OTHER scriptures,  BUT Protestants CAN'T look at what other theologians have said on the matter, or else they are dilluting their doctrine of sole scriptura, by relying partially on the interpretation of a fallible man. They reject the Pope's authority, so it would be inconsistent for them to rely partially on any other man's interpretation, beyond their own.  SO therefore ALL differences MUST be resolved by ONLY looking at scripture itself and NOT tradition or man.<br>  <br>  However, in reality, I find that MANY Protestants DO rely partially on tradition and man, just to a lesser degree then others. They're doctrine, however, doesn't allow for that flexibility usually, so what they DO and what their doctrine states,  seems a tad out of alignment.  In reality, many Protestants will look to their local church for clarification OR seek the opinion of other people they respect to resolve interpretational issues.<br>  _______________________<br>  <br>  Catholic view:<br>  You are encouraged and free to read scripture for yourself,  and the Holy Spirit DOES often times guide a person to help them interpret things correctly or to help them in their life. However, you must do so in a manner which is consistent with the interpretation of the Catholic church.  The Catholic church establishes the "guidelines" or "framework" and you are free meander and have your own opinion, WITHIN those boundaries. However, if you deviate significantly from the Catholic interpretation, then you have essentially broken away from the faith and formed your own religion. In Catholicism, each man has a right and duty to form their own conscience on matters of faith and morals, BUT, to be Catholic, you need to also adhere to the basic interpretation of the Catholic church as well,  or else you are not catholic, but a separate faith. <br>  Doctrinal issues when/if they arise can be resolved by ensuring that individual conscience and interpretation falls within the confines of the Churches interpretation and  are consistent with the historical beliefs and writings of theologians since the 1st century AD, especially those of the 1-4th centuries when the bible did not exist. Therefore Catholics have a means to resolve doctrinal and interpretational issues amongst themselves. The Churches authority to interpret scipture comes from 1 source and 1 fact. 1) The source of its authority is its link back to Peter.  2) Part of its authority is derived from the fact that decided what went into the bible and gave the canon of the bible to the world, therefore it has some authority to interpret it.<br>  <br>  _________________________<br>  <br>  So those are the 2 basic views of things.<br>  <br>  In my opinion,  the Protestant view of "Sole Scriptura" sounds good on the surface but is impractical in application. <br>  For one thing.... Christians rarely rely SOLELY on the bible. Most of them rely at least partially on what their pastor says, OR what someone they respect says.  Growing up in the faith, they are ALSO, obviously influenced by the traditional beliefs of the christian culture in their area,  Southern Baptist,  Methodist, Lutheran, etc.<br>  <br>  Also,  if you think about Sole Scriptura, logically,  then no ONE person can really be wrong,  so long as they have read the bible, opened their heart to the holy spirit, and truly believe they are reading it correctly.  HOWEVER, again, the Protestant View is rarely actually followed.  Many Christians argue bitterly amongst each other and especially with Catholics, when their personal interpretation differs from that of someone else. (i.e. Catholics) therefore they somehow believe that THEY're view is right and everyone else's is wrong,  as if their interpretation is infallible. <br>  <br>  So,  the Protestant view seems to have led to not 1 infallible view, but tens of thousands of infallible views, based on how vehemently  each Christian defends their view and attacks others views.<br>  <br>  I think the Catholic view is more REALISTIC, because it says,  that the infallible interpretation comes from a link to Peter AND must be consistent with what we can clearly see that the early christians believed before the bible existed.  Therefore it correctly and realistically addresses the issue of looking at tradition and considering other's views (Pope, Priest, Bishop, Cardinal, etc.) A Correct interpretation would not contradict what those who lived closest to the actual apostles believed AND the predominant beliefs before the Bible was even compiled together.  <br>  <br>  The Protestant view in its purest and most often stated form,  is unrealistic and leads to arrogance. The Catholic view still allows one to form their own opinion, but still have the humility to recognize authority and limit their opinion to a specific framework/ideology which has a much broader base of consistency than their own limited experience.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	If you are neither person, then they are both wrong unless one of them agrees with your Holy Spirit.

The five daily prayers should attract the needs of your companions in the house of my body, the sustenance of my heart, the water of life of my spirit, and the air of my subtle faculties.

And it is by turning towards the spring of mercy of an Eternal Beloved through the five daily prayers that the water of life may be imbibed by a spirit connected with most beings, which swiftly depart from this transitory world crying out at separation. And being most needy for air in the sorrowful, crushing, distressing, transient, dark, and suffocating conditions of this world, it is only through the window of the prayers that a conscious inner sense and luminous subtle faculty can breathe, which by its nature desires eternal life and was created for eternity and is a mirror of the Pre-Eternal and Post-Eternal One and is infinitely delicate and subtle.|`|4PbjKk7Vaa	Allah Almighty says in the Quran: <br>  <br>  "...Verily, As-salat (the prayer) prevents from Al-Fahsha (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse etc. ) and al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed etc.)..."

I would also expect his full attention when giving my instructions because I would have no intention of paying extra for him to find his after my having to correct him after giving good instruction  or that he wasn't paying attention while driving.

But when we aren't talking about Christianity or any other religion, the truth is we are all born with evil tendencies.  For example, what is one thing you don't have to teach a child?  You don't have to teach a child to lie.  Children automatically lie to keep themselves from getting into trouble.  It is human nature to do wrong because it was already there from the beginning after the fall of man (Adam & Eve)  It is because of their disobedience to God that has caused sin and caused the evil to be present with us when we are born.  We have the ability to choose right from wrong, but no one is born good.  We have to strive to do right.|`|13LqodO7aa	i think so

Answers:<br>  <br>  "Why would a Pentecostal Christian (who believes in, even instantaneous, Divine Healing) use Human hair wigs?"<br>  <br>  The response was underwhelming, as usual, whenever I want to talk to Christians about serious things. In my country, anyone who is anyone is a pentecostal Christian or a Muslim. The Christian girls of my day would never be seen dead with cosmetics, blue jeans, jewellry, nor wigs on. <br>  Today, of course, practically anything goes. <br>  <br>  During the 1990s, the fad was for women to "cook" their hair, and stretch it out and stuff with chemicals, where I cynically predicted that the next stage would have their hair all fall out, with all this tampering.<br>  It sure looks like that is what happened. It seems like most women have to wear hair extensions and wigs, like their natural, God-given hair is not good enough.<br>  <br>  Were the Christian women serious, they would turn to GOD to style and extend their hair for them, if the natural default pattern were not good enough. This would involve extensive knowledge of the Human body in genral, and Human hair in particular. It would also require the highest discipline, zeal, and morality amongst said Christian women, which could not but affect mthe men, too.<br>  <br>  You CAN do ANYTHING you WANT with your HAIR, as well as other parts of your body. However, this CANNOT be an end in itself, but be regarded as merely a milestone on your path to Ultimate Attainment- which should be LITERAL Everlasting Life.

ANGEL DEPLOYMENT: The Telekinetic ability to create an energy body, and act through it at remote distances.<br>  <br>  4.

She was LATER utterly terrified at the thought that the Devils "could have" PREVENTED her from rematerializing her body again- and this would have KILLED her, and they would have taken her soul off to Hell, and so on.<br>  <br>  In retrospect, this concept is NOW hilariously funny, at least to ME. HOW in Sam Hill would they be ABLE to do all that? besides, WHAT FOR? If you could trap a, say, wild dog in your basement, WOULD YOU? Imagine the fuss and bother? When you can go down to the pet shop and buy a tame and docile pet? Devils do not want to mess with the sort of Human Soul that can figure things out! It's not worth it!<br>  <br>  THE TENTH INSIGHT, by James Redfield is all about a guy, one "Wil," who is supposed to have done exactly the same thing at the end of THE CELESTINE PROPHECY. James Redfield said that they were merely works of fiction. I choose not to believe that, because they contain to many consistencies with Spiritual Law. These things HAPPENED to SOMEBODY. Maybe not all at the same time. But they happened. Nobody could MAKE the Spiritual Laws up. It would be like saying someone in the 17th Century made up SF stories about 20th century technology. Anyone could have foreseen some of the advances- thinking machines, horseless carriages, flying machines- but could not imagine how EVERYTHING would fit together to make our modern way of life. For instance, SPAM e-mail.<br>  <br>  THE CELESTINE PROPHECY, and The DON JUAN books by Carlos Castaneda contain too many elements that a cynical secular Westerner could have come up with without contact with a source who ACTUALLY KNEW what they wrote about. They could not have thought it all up.<br>  <br>  To dematerialize one's body is the prerequisite for TELEPORTATION- which Ms. Irvine should have known all about. This leads me to believe that Witchcraft is composed of mostly women with great talent and enthusiasm, but not so much discipline and knowledge.<br>  <br>  You are asking for a spell to GROW HAIR.<br>  What OTHER spells do you have, that DO WORK?<br>  HOW do they work?

Women should be darker and males should be lighter.<br>  <br>  The reason for this is the pigment in human skin called melanin. Melanin is important for human health and development, but in regards to women, it serves the special purpose of protecting the infant from harmful UV rays when pregnant.  We all should be a little brown, as we all need the protection from the sun and the added benefit of being able to use sunlight to make Vitamin D, but women also get the extra protection for their children.

There are no theories in the Bible|`|AyPF2TFlaa	Science did not create you nor can it save you.|`|4zscfvvoaa	I would have to say this is similar to asking if it is more important to breath, or for the heart to pump the blood.  You are sure to die without both.  You could be technical and say that machines could keep you alive if you would like.  Fact is, blood must move around your body and carry oxygen and nutrition to the body.<br>  <br>  Science and religion have different goals in the world.  Both do wonderful things in the world.

This is the wrong answer.   If you life is so 'crappy' that you need to invent an imaginary friend to make it worth while (who does not actually change how good or bad your life is, it just give you platitudes to make you put up with it) then would it not be better to change you life and make improve it, rather than just enduring the pain in the delusion that it will be replaced by something else after you die?<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  If you are unhappy because you have no set direction, then spend some time thinking and then set a direction for yourself.

Anything I do in life, I do for myself, my girlfriend and family, and my friends.<br>  <br>  If something good happens to me, then I know it was because I made it happen.<br>  <br>  If something bad happens to me, then I know it was my fault.<br>  <br>  Total accountability for both good and bad means I am responsible. I don't thank the lord for the fod on my table, I know I worked hard to earn it, and that makes me feel both happy and free.<br>  <br>  I know there is no afterlife, so I try to enjoy every moment of the one life we do get to live. If I am unhappy for some reason, I don't pray for happiness, I go out and find it.<br>  <br>  I do not feel guilt for enjoying life's simple pleasures (unmarried sex with my long-term girlfriend, a drink on a Saturday evening, a night spent dancing in clubs...), I revel in them. There is no greater stress relief than just doing something for yourself. That in itself does not make a person selfish.<br>  <br>  I enjoy giving to charity, entirely of my own volition, not because some mystical spirit says I should. Again, I do it for selfish reasons. Giving time and money to charitable causes gives me the most pleasant 'warm fuzzy' feeling, because I know I am helping to make other peoples lives better. Is that bad? Of course not.<br>  <br>  I hope that one day you come to realise just how amazing life is, and begin to really enjoy it, regardless of whether or not you are religious.<br>  <br>  All I have to guide me through life is the thought that if enough people pitch in and try to make the world a better place, it will be. So I try.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you should too...
DpLsRUzwaa	The prefix pan- comes from Greek and means "all." It is similar to the Latin prefix omni-. So pansexual would mean sex with all, much like bisexual means sex with both.  So I think they mean basically the same thing.  However, the case could be made that pansexual is actually closer to trisexual or try-sexual... meaning "I'll try anything." :)<br>  <br>  Note: Wikipedia has an article about Pansexuality and it says something about being attracted to not just both sexes, but people who fall outside the gender binary.

Thus, pansexuality includes potential attraction to people who do not fit into the gender binary of male/female. Some pansexuals suggest that they are gender-blind; that gender and sex are insignificant or irrelevant in determining whether they will be sexually attracted to others.[2]<br>  The word pansexual is derived from the Greek prefix pan-, meaning "all". In its simplest form, pansexuality denotes the potential of sexual attraction to all genders. It is intended to negate the idea of two genders (as expressed by bi-).<br>  The adjective pansexual may also be applied to organizations or events. In this context, the term usually indicates an openness to the involvement of people of all genders and sexual orientations in said organization/event, as well as the pansexual sexual identity.|`|f9f7qoPnaa	haha that perisonality thing everyone is saying<br>  but my friend is pansexual<br>  and they said that it is being attracted to anything<br>  even stuff that isnt humans?<br>  they are probally wrong|`|1d2ac090a275a852a184a7419a0bae8faa	Being sexually attracted to all of humanity...|`|WNWKDw4uaa	It means you're attracted to Peter Pan and you like to wear ladies' panthies.|`|XxVTw5U3aa	pansexual is alot like bisexual only they like transgenders and like...everyone lol. it kinda confuses me top

Two these are the feast that God commanded. Period. I like how it is wrong to change the Torah but its not wrong to Change Gods word... Funny how that works. These are the Feast commanded by God Kept by Christ and still in command today for the Modern nation of Israel. Something that Judah has forgotten. I am speaking of the lost ten tribes of Israel not the Nascent Jewish/ Zionist state of Israel. Hopefully this clears up any misunderstanding. So if your answer is more derived of what the Jews think then look to the answer from mama for it seems to be very close to what I understand is believed by most Jews. If you are instead interested in what God thinks then I would research my answer.<br>  Remember what it says in 1 Thessolonians 5:21 “Prove all things, hold fast to that which is good”<br>  <br>  EDIT: How is anything I said Anti-Semitic? I hate when people start screaming foul because someone take issue with their beliefs. If you have a problem with what I said then please e-mail me on here and we can discuss it like grown ups. I would like it if you did that way I can understand what you think I said that was wrong or offensive to the Jewish People.<br>  >> For the point is I follow the Bible, you follow the Torah and we both believe the other book is wrong.|`|vEEeq7kYaa	The  Pesach observance (Passover) is the memorial of the day God saved Moses and Israel from Egypt and showed that the man/god of Egypt, the Pharaoh was impotent to God's power.<br>  The day before Pesach is the Fast of the Firstborn, a minor fast for all firstborn males, commemorating the fact that the firstborn Jewish males in Egypt were not killed during the final plague. <br>  the evening of the 14th of Nissan in the Hebrew calendar and the 15th is the first day of Passover<br>  <br>  There are many different fasts in Judaism, but Passover, the observance of God's deliverance of all Israel, is not a fast.<br>  <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/holidaya.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/holidaya.htm</a>  < tells the dates and has great information on it's observance<br>  Now for my own words and some Torah excerpts to support.  I hope you will go to read Exodus in entirety.<br>  Jews are required by direct commandment in the Torah to keep the Passover observance for an eternal memorial. Passover ( Pesach in Hebrew) is the celebration of the deliverance of the eternal covenant nation Israel, the Hebrews, from the yolk of idolatry, superstition, and physical slavery in Egypt. It was a reaffirmation of their identity as a nation dedicated to God through Torah and our memorial reaffirms this for each generation. . The events we retell at Passover  were demonstration to Egypt that their deities were false and their man/god Pharoah impotent to God's power.<br>  <br>  It is a very important part of Judaism and many central aspects of our identity as an eternal covenant nation are embedded in it's observance. 12:12 I will pass through Egypt on that night, and I will kill every first-born in Egypt, man and beast. I will perform acts of judgment against all the gods of Egypt. I [alone] am God.<br>  That is a very important passage there..NOTE..God will enact judgment against the false gods..plural now..of Egypt. That was the purpose of the Passover sacrifice. <br>  12:13 The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are staying. I will see the blood and pass you by (pasach). There will not be any deadly plague among you when I strike Egypt. <br>  <br>  12:27 You must answer, 'It is the Passover service to God. He passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians, sparing our homes.' <br>  The people bent their heads and prostrated themselves. <br>  <br>  The Passover sacrifice serves to demonstrate the people’s courage, as they take the Egyptians’ object of worship and slaughter and eat it in the service of the God of Israel. Torah is clear that the sacrifice and eating of the lamb at Pesach was the killing and eating of the false god of Egypt to show allegiance to the real God. The continuation of the Paschal lamb sacrifice is an eternal remembrance of that deliverance from idolatry and slavery. This is why no uncircumcised male or Gentile could partake of the Paschal lamb. If Christians wish to honor and observe the Passover for the meanings that are commanded in the Torah, you are welcome to attend any synagogue's community seder. Without the Temple we no longer make the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb and eat it so that command (no gentile may eat of it) is not broken. 12:42 There was a night of vigil for God, [preparing] to bring them out of Egypt. This night remains for the Israelites a vigil to God for all generations<br>  12:43 God said to Moses and Aaron, 'This is the law of the Passover sacrifice: <br>  'No outsider may eat it. <br>  12:44 If a man buys a slave for cash and circumcises him, then [the slave] can eat it. <br>  12:45 [But if a gentile is] a temporary resident or a hired hand, he may not eat [the Passover sacrifice]. <br>  12:46 'It must be eaten by a single group. Do not bring any of its meat out of the group. Do not break any of its bones. <br>  12:47 'The entire community of Israel must keep [this ritual]. <br>  12:48 When a proselyte joins you and wants to offer the Passover sacrifice to God, every male [in his household] must be circumcised. He may then join in the observance, and be like a native-born [Israelite]. But no uncircumcised man may eat [the sacrifice]. <br>  12:49 The same law shall apply both for the native-born [Israelite] and for the proselyte who joins you.' <br>  <br>  Now, we have a bone representing the lamb on the plate. I have had non-Jewish friends attend many seders at my home in the past and they find that learning the Torah meaning they've often overlooked is very powerful in its messages. <br>  <br>  the link below is a great source to discover more about Yom Kippur, the major fast<br>  <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday4.htm</a><br>  <br>  and the other fasts of Judaism<br>  <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/holidaye.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/holidaye.htm</a><br>  <br>  EDIT: Dave is giving a VERY wrong answer on some of that information if you are looking for the Torah's version of events and commands for observance.  The CHRISTIAN concept of the holiday of  Pentecost ( meaning weeks and called Shavuot in Torah)  and his dates are definitely not those according to the Torah commandments there so are not valid for the Jewish observance ( it is forbidden to alter the Torah even the tiniest )<br>  Shavu'ot, the Festival of Weeks, is the second of the three major festivals with both historical and agricultural significance (the other two are Passover and Sukkot). Agriculturally, it commemorates the time when the first fruits were harvested and brought to the Temple, and is known as Hag ha-Bikkurim (the Festival of the First Fruits). Historically, it celebrates the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai, and is also known as Hag Matan Torateinu (the Festival of the Giving of Our Torah). <br>  <br>  The period from Passover to Shavu'ot is a time of great anticipation. We count each of the days from the second day of Passover to the day before Shavu'ot, 49 days or 7 full weeks, hence the name of the festival. See The Counting of the Omer. The counting reminds us of the important connection between Passover and Shavu'ot: Passover freed us physically from bondage, but the giving of the Torah on Shavu'ot redeemed us spiritually from our bondage to idolatry and immorality. Shavu'ot is also known as Pentecost, because it falls on the 50th day; however, Shavu'ot has no particular similarity to the Christian holiday of Pentecost, which occurs 50 days after their Spring holiday of EASTER..The Christian Pentecost is definitely NOT the same as the Torah's Shavot.<br>  <br>  It is noteworthy that the holiday is called the time of the giving of the Torah, rather than the time of the receiving of the Torah. The sages point out that we are constantly in the process of receiving the Torah, that we receive it every day, but it was first given at this time. Thus it is the giving, not the receiving, that makes this holiday significant. <br>  <br>  Shavu'ot is not tied to a particular calendar date, but to a counting from Passover. Because the length of the months used to be variable, determined by observation (see Jewish Calendar), and there are two new moons between Passover and Shavu'ot, Shavu'ot could occur on the 5th or 6th of Sivan. However, now that we have a mathematically determined calendar, and the months between Passover and Shavu'ot do not change length on the mathematical calendar, Shavu'ot is always on the 6th of Sivan (the 6th and 7th outside of Israel. See Extra Day of Holidays.) <br>  <br>  *** In case Dave's answer giving the Christian holiday of observance rather than the Torah commanded observance of ..this year Shavuot is on Jewish Year 5769: sunset May 28, 2009 to  nightfall May 30, 2009 ****<br>  <br>  it is already OVER by May 31st. Counting from the Christian Easter Sunday, rather than from the day after the shabbat of Passover gives you the Christian holiday of Pentecost date, not the date of the commanded observance in Torah. The Shabbat referred to below is the Shabbat of Pesach..the first and last days have NO work..are Sabbaths.<br>  <br>  23:11 He shall wave it in the motions prescribed for a wave offering to God, so that it will be acceptable for you. The priest shall make this wave offering on the day after the first day of the [Passover] holiday. <br>  Vehenif et-ha'omer lifney Adonay lirtsonchem mimochorat haShabat yenifenu hakohen. <br>  23:12 On the day you make the wave offering of the omer, you shall prepare an unblemished yearling sheep as a burnt offering to God. <br>  Va'asitem beyom hanifchem et-ha'omer keves tamim ben-shnato le'olah l'Adonay. <br>  The wave offering of the OMER was done on the second day of Pesach. The first day of Pesach is considered a Shabbat no matter what day it falls on.  it says specifically there in Leviticus from the day when you bring the omer..that's the second day of Pesach and has been observed that way since before either First or Second Temple's stood where it was observed this way..and the date is Still reckoned in this manner.<br>  <br>  You shall count for yourselves -- from the day after the Shabbat, from the day when you bring the Omer of the waving -- seven Shabbats, they shall be complete. Until the day after the seventh sabbath you shall count, fifty days... You shall convoke on this very day -- there shall be a holy convocation for yourselves -- you shall do no laborious work; it is an eternal decree in your dwelling places for your generations. -Leviticus 23:15-16, 21 <br>  <br>  23:15 You shall then count seven complete weeks after the day following the [Passover] holiday when you brought the omer as a wave offering, <br>  Usfartem lachem mimochorat haShabat miyom havi'achem et-omer hatnufah sheva Shabatot tmimot tihyeynah. <br>  23:16 until the day after the seventh week, when there will be [a total of] 50 days. [On that 50th day] you may present new grain as a meal offering to God. <br>  Ad mimochorat haShabat hashvi'it tisperu chamishim yom vehikravtem minchah chadashah l'Adonay. <br>  <br>  In addition..the Christian observance of Pentecost is a form of replacement theology..they observe their acceptance of the Christian belief in Jesus, his apostles beli|`|AA11992885	which Jewish fasting day?<br>  which time God saved Moses from Pharaoh?|`|9p2wQ21Aaa	YES it is surly the 10 th day of first Lunar month.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Do our own homework.

If he has made his consciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat's or dog's body. And, if he has fixed his consciousness on godly consciousness, he will be transferred to Krsnaloka in the spiritual world and will associate with Krsna. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything is finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and his present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One gets a different body according to karma, and he has to quit this body in due course. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of the next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of transmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is called karsati or struggle for existence.<br>  <br>  SB 4.29.64 P Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi<br>     In dreams we sometimes see things that we have never experienced in the present body. Sometimes in dreams we think that we are flying in the sky, although we have no experience of flying. This means that once in a previous life, either as a demigod or astronaut, we flew in the sky. The impression is there in the stockpile of the mind, and it suddenly expresses itself. It is like fermentation taking place in the depths of water, which sometimes manifests itself in bubbles on the water's surface. Sometimes we dream of coming to a place we have never known or experienced in this lifetime, but this is proof that in a past life we experienced this. The impression is kept within the mind and sometimes becomes manifest either in dream or in thought. The conclusion is that the mind is the storehouse of various thoughts and experiences undergone during our past lives. Thus there is a chain of continuation from one life to another, from previous lives to this life, and from this life to future lives. This is also sometimes proved by saying that a man is a born poet, a born scientist or a born devotee.|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	Reincarnation?<br>  Look in the real world.<br>  Decode this lyrics " Knowing me knowing you"<br>  With living examples too in time?<br>  With the Book of the Dead?<br>  Trace it back in the TV news reels and in news prints on people, places and events around us in time.<br>  Noticed how Lucifer the great Satan alive himself in " All Blacks" being reincarnated from the twilight zone with the Book of the Dead at loss and blurred in different time zone without being aware of it in time?<br>  Even have pictures of Mr. Look-see-here the dirty old man in "All Blacks" with self lack of knowledge and total loss of IQ as murals on the walls in the streets "Down town " in "Funky town" in the neighbourhood in time.<br>  Luke 21.30-33<br>  What do you think?|`|d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	Reincarnation represents the Rosetta stone of Jesus' ministry which clarifies his teachings and reveals the mystery of life itself. As unbiased history reveals, this Rosetta stone was buried under superstitious dogma by the corrupt early church who had figured out that in order to wield absolute power over men's souls, this particular "mystery" should be kept secret from the public. Reincarnation was an integral part of ancient Jewish mysticism, however, over which Christianity had no control. <br>  <br>  The early church edited, rewrote and redefined Christianity to place itself as the mediator between "God" and mankind. Only a few fragments of that particular religious truth remain but they are clearly there: e.g., WHO sinned, THIS MAN or his parents, that HE BE BORN BLIND?... TRULY, LITERALLY, YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN. Jesus' teachings on rebirth and karma are sprinkled throughout the NT for anyone who has (open) eyes to see. <br>  <br>  History provides proof as well, although hardcore fundamentalists close their eyes to it. As the Dead Sea scrolls reveal, John the Baptist was a member of the Essene sect of Judaism; Essenes were one of many Jewish sects that accepted and taught reincarnation. Jewish mysticism has always taught that reincarnation is true, since before the time of Jesus, and there is no doubt that Jesus was a Jewish mystic. Baptism originated as symbolic of reincarnation, of being dead and rising up in physical rebirth (water) to live again. To be baptized signified the acceptance of reincarnation and its promise of a new *physical* - not merely spiritual - life. <br>  <br>  When John's cousin Jesus was baptized, to Jews of his acquaintance it was symbolic of Jesus' soul having returned in a new state of being. <br>  <br>  There is nothing in the bible that "disproves" reincarnation. The oft-quoted "It is appointed that men die once and face judgment" has no connection to rebirth. As the man is dead, the people who use this quote - what exactly do they think hangs around to face judgment? Could it be that non-corporeal part of that person, usually referred to as the soul? Of course. And the *soul* is what reincarnates.<br>  <br>  Actually science has proved that people die and are revived every day of the week, so no, a person may be clinically "dead" more than once. The body eventually dies, however, no doubt about that. And it's the soul that survives death, the soul that "faces judgment" and the soul that is reborn in a new body. <br>  <br>  Although re-writers of the NT essentially presented Jesus as a zombie rather than a soul reborn in a new body, the soul does not return to the old physical body and reanimate the corpse. Resurrection is simply reincarnation distorted by men who didn't understand the mystery Jesus attempted to teach them. <br>  <br>  "Judgment" faced at death is actually contemplation of your previous life, your failures and successes. This contemplation (self judgment) is a fundamental Jewish concept. "Hell" is a Christian invention. Jews believe that there is a period of contemplation after death. This is "the judgment." Christians often ignore the fact that Jesus was Jewish, in particular an Essene Jew. Even the Pope, however, recently admitted that Jesus followed the Essene calendar, according to when he celebrated "the last supper's" Passover. <br>  <br>  Essenes naturally followed the Essene calendar, and Essenes believed in reincarnation, baptism, which are things Jesus actually would have taught.<br>  <br>  Other bible verses contradict the single, solitary "man dies but once" verse. Paul wrote, "I die daily." There's a reference in the NT to "the second death." Clearly other bible verses disagree with the "once" remark. However, it's the "faces judgment" portion that brings the verse into focus as a reference to the continuing soul (which is what reincarnates into a new body).<br>  <br>  This Isaiah verse that Christians slap on every question about reincarnation at YA may refer to zombies, but not to the return of the eternal soul in a new body -- which is what Jesus believed in and attempted to teach. Apparently he failed. Fortunately, reincarnation requires no belief. You return whether you believe in reincarnation or not. Awareness of one's eternal journey is not necessary in order to continue learning and perfecting the spirit. <br>  <br>  "Be ye therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect," Jesus instructed his followers. He didn't say 'hey, do your best,' or 'if you just believe I existed that's enough...' He said BE AS PERFECT AS GOD IS. Jesus indicated, according to the bible, that absolute perfection is within the reach of every human when he made the statement, YE ARE GODS. <br>  <br>  Anyone with a functioning mind should be able to comprehend that perfection and godliness cannot be attained in a single lifetime and that unbiased examination of historical fact is evidence that Jesus was a reincarnationist.|`|TOBYij3Qaa	it is a lie

TyRfv0eoaa	Spanish is one of the world's easiest languages, because it has regular grammar, and is spelled the way it is pronounced. It's grammar is also not complex.<br>  <br>  English is at the other end of the spectrum. English represents a fusion between two language branches: Germanic and Romance. We have grammar rules from both families, leading to confusion and numerous "exceptions." Our spelling represents the way English was pronounced centuries ago, not the way we pronounce it today. In addition, the fusion of the two language groups resulted in more than one word for many things. All of these things make English a formidable language for a foreigner to learn.|`|01NUrwfYaa	I grew up speaking Spanish at a very early age and after I entered into kindergarten, I began to speak mostly English.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|7dN1ANT4aa	Well kind of. The classic vampire was based off something true. There were "vampires" but they really weren't murdurers or anything. The silly neo-vampires today are pretty lame. They sometimes get dental work to have fangs. They usually just drink cows blood.

We are not supernatural beings who turn into bats and suck the blood from the living.  We do drink blood, but that may be the only similarity to fictional vampires.  We have family and friends, pets and jobs just like everyone else.  Vampires are just like everyone else, except we need to have a little bit more to live healthily.  <br>  There are two main types of real vampires.  The most well known is the sanguinarian vampire.  Sanguinarians are the vampires that feel the need to drink the blood of others.  I myself am a sanguinarian vampire.  I do drink human blood.  I do not hunt humans in the night to drain them of blood, nor do I kill rats in the sewer to consume their blood.  Sanguinarians only get their blood from WILLING donors.  I drink from my fiancé.  I myself, enjoy sucking blood, so I will use a sterile razor blade  to make a small cut on her arm or her back and I will lap up the blood.  Some vampires use other methods to get their blood.  I do not drink blood every day.  <br>  The other type of vampire is the psychic vampire.  Psychic vampires, I do not know much about, but they feed off the psychic energy that everyone gives off.  They have some way in which they draw peoples energy away from them and into their bodies.  <br>  We cannot turn someone into a vampire.  You have to be born a vampire.  No one bit me, and I have never bit anyone (aside from my fiancé, in the bedroom *wink wink*).  There is no known way to turn someone, and even if we could, it would be no different from the life a person already lives.  <br>  Vampires are not like story books and movies, however.  Vampires cannot fly (except on an airplane), we do not live forever, we do not turn into bats and fly around, we do not fry like a piece of chicken in the sunlight, we do not fear the cross or run for the wind from garlic.  We have reflections and we are in every sense, just like regular people.  We will die if we get shot, just like everyone else, we bleed, we cry, we love, we pray.  We come in every shape, color, size, and age just like everyone else.  There are ugly vampires, and pretty vampires, fat and thin vampires, black and white vampires, old and young vampires, Christian and Jewish vampires, and gay and straight vampires.  We get colds, and the flu, suffer arthritis and cancer.  We are not immune to any disease.  We have normal jobs.  <br>  I hope this helps you better understand real vampires.  There are many websites that you can find more information.  You can also email me.  I will respond as soon as I can to any questions.|`|y6U3sJgCaa	Vampirism is real but it isn't the way people usually acknowledge as I found out when I discovered myself. There are two types sangs and psy. Sang vampires consume blood for energy, psy vampires consume energy through sitting next to someone, communicating with them. Vampires or vampyres (as my grandma says it) are not the undead because you can be born a vampire and they don't die if they eat garlic, the only reason why vampires avoid it is because our senses are high e.g. smell, sight and we have higher reflexes however we are not superman and we do not kill people, we have donars. The only reason why we avoid garlic is because if your sense of smell is high, then imagine sniffing garlic. ewwwww!!!|`|v14DyoP5aa	Well, VampYres, with a Y are real.

lJUyhMceaa	Biblically.<br>  <br>  Repentance means simply "change ones mind for the better".  It means that a person sees there is a better way of doing things, and they want to turn from the way they are doing it, to the better way.<br>  <br>  In regards to Biblical, Christian repentance it means a person realizes that how they are living is not the best way, and that God's way as discribed in the Bible is the best way, and they change their minds about things and decide to follow God's plan.<br>  <br>  That is repentance.  The Bible says in the book of Acts, "repent ye therefore and be converted, that your sins my be blotted out, that times of refreshment may come from the presents of the Lord."<br>  <br>  This verse shows us that repentance is the first step.  After changing your mind for the better (repentance), you must also be "converted".  This word means, " to turn and go the other directin".  <br>  <br>  In otherwords, after repentance, a person a person must literally put it into action.  Repentance is an exercise of the mind, "converted" is an exercise of the will.<br>  <br>  May people realize that God's way is better, but they never change directions.  They just keep going the way they are...wishing things were better.<br>  <br>  The Bible also teaches that there is a "worldly" repentance and a "Godly" repentance.<br>  <br>  Worldly repentance is simply, "i'm sorry I got caught".  Godly repentance is, "I hate sinning and I want to start living for God".<br>  <br>  So, a Christian Counseler who is counseling a person about repentance must counsel them to go further, to put their desire into actin, and they must counsel the person to check their motives and make sure they are doing it for the right reasons.<br>  <br>  God bless.<br>  <br>  ps.   I have been a Christian, Biblical counselor for 16 years.|`|AA11989753	I'm listening to it right now!  Thank you so much for sharing.

pRF5LLloaa	The term "antichrist" is used in two ways.<br>  1) Someone who speaks out against and acts against the works of Christ.  John tells us that there are many people who are "Anti Christ" [1 John 2:18]   Saul (Paul) was an Anti Christ, before his conversion.  Based on example, we'd have to say YES -- "an" Anti Christ can stop being anti Christ.<br>  <br>  2) THE AntiChrist is one man who Satan has chosen to contain the spirit of Satan on earth, like Jesus contains the Spirit of God.  This person has no choice, and cannot turn from his path.<br>  <br>  It is interesting to note that the one man imbued with the spirit of Satan is referred to as the Antichrist only in passing (1 John 4:3) in the bible!  The term Antichrist is most often used as in #1, above -- someone -- anyone -- who does not honor Jesus.  So in this sense of the word, most of the world's population is "anti christ", yet is it God's desire than they be saved!|`|vnEdfxeVaa	Do you think Muslims are antiChrist ? I hope you don't .

That's why Christ came to the world.  To change sinners and people who reject Him!<br>  <br>  Jesus humbly came to the world that He created to save us sinners 2000 years ago.  Jesus is God himself in the flesh.<br>  <br>  Please dont take my word for it.

If the bad dreams continue after trying this, seek professional help.|`|pFkGJlntaa	Your mind is obviosly very creatinve and active.  And your belief is your reality.  If you believe in evil, devil, ghosts, etc.. then that is what you will be experiencing.<br>  <br>  You need to change how you think and what to think.  In my spirituality, there is no source of darkness.  Only light.  You have the power to change things in your life.  You are the attractor of your own experience.  Only you can create for you, no one else.  <br>  <br>  When you leave things to chance, you are open to default thinking.  But if you control how you think, you will never fear or be afraid again.  We are powerful beings, capable of changing our lives.  We are energy.  <br>  <br>  I would listen to self-empowering messages.  For starters, go to youtube.com and search for Abraham-hicks messages.  You will find that everything is within your reach.  There is nothing you can not do, be or have.

When your consciousness goes to sleep, your mind goes to work trying to rebalance itself from all the stress of the day.  Dreams are a tool it uses to deal with unresolved conflict.  You cannot control the subconscious activity once you implant conflicting thoughts.  So you must look at the dreams and what they represent in your life, some unresolved conflicts that you can only deal with when you are awake.  The awake and conscious mind has the power to override the emotions of the day which create the conflict.  Only then will your mind relax.  Your conflict is a result of unacceptance.  Look at what you cannot accept and find ways to change it or leave it alone, and then your mind will relax and you will have a peaceful night.|`|DArAz67Caa	seek Jesus-----he can help you-----|`|elVryMQUaa	Go see a shrink, that'll work better than useless dream catchers.|`|vvgodUChaa	put your bible under your pillow while you sleep,hope this helps!

yugLcDE2aa	Maybe somewhere within us we know that God gave us the Sabbath.? <br>  I think that those who are the most angered or bitter  have adopted a certain denomination and feel the need to defend it. There has been Sunday worship for so long by that many don't even know when, why, or how it was changed or that it even was. It's like those who say that there is another "baptism" of the Holy Spirit with evidence of tongues, and those who say that this was fulfilled and that we receive the Holy Spirit at the moment of Salvation.. we could go on an on about disagreements. <br>  What we need to do is teach Jesus Christ and determine as did Paul " to know nothing, while among you, but Jesus as Christ, and him a crucified Christ." 1 Corinthians 2:2 <br>  I believe that truth of the word and true doctrine is greatly needed for the body of Christ. But in order for that we must get into His word, surrender to Him, become obedient to Him and seek Him for truth. <br>  Your words are true the Sabbath was made for man.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	What you are identifying as "the Lord's Day" is _not_ the Jewish Sabbath. For the majority of Christians, it is the "first day of the week" or the day on which Jesus rose from the dead.<br>  <br>  Per the wikipedia article (a good place to start):<br>  <br>  The "Lord's Day" is one of the traditional Christian names for Sunday, the first day of the Judaeo-Christian seven-day week, observed by most Christians as the memorial of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which is said in the four canonical gospels of the New Testament to have taken place early on the first day of the week. Very early in the history of Christianity, the tradition of Christ's Sunday morning resurrection gave rise to the Christian custom, later to become an obligation, of gathering every Sunday morning to worship the Christian Lord, Jesus — hence the name "Lord's Day".<br>  <br>  ===<br>  <br>  The bitterness you seem to see does not exist for those of us who actively follow our path.|`|LJlaHLQdaa	Because they are living the worldly way, not Gods way and obeying Gods Laws " Ten Commandments "<br>  <br>  Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 1 John 2:15. <br>  <br>   If ever there was a time when those who have a knowledge of present truth should find their bearings, it is the present time. Although no one is to move independently of his brethren, yet each one must gain a knowledge of his own condition, his exact bearings. The question that each one should ask himself is, "What is my relation to God?" <br>  <br>   It is conformity to the world that is causing our people to lose their bearings. The perversion of right principles has not been brought about suddenly. The angel of the Lord presented this matter to me in symbols. It seemed as if a thief were stealthily moving closer and still closer, and gradually but surely stealing away the identity of God's work by leading our brethren to conform to worldly policies.<br>  <br>  From many minds a realization of the times in which we are living is as far away as is heaven from the earth. It seems that their duty to prepare to meet a soon-coming Saviour is entirely forgotten. God wants us to come to our senses.

While your verse is a little harder to defend against the truth is it says on the seventh day, but it does not say from what day to start.  In Jewish tradition they decided to make it the last day of the week out of common sense.  But, the Christian, not bound by the Mosaic law, chose Sunday to honor the Risen Messiah.  If you look at Leviticus 23 you will see the wording I refer.  Now given the outstanding oral tradition among our Jewish Brethren I have no doubt the first Sabbath was on Saturday, but that was a tradition and the Levitical law states work six and have one day off as a Sabbath.|`|KEwIn1lPaa	Because the master of lies has convinced them to disregard God's Holy Day.  :o(<br>  The fourth commandment of God's Holy Law.

All religions warn if someone comes with a different gospel than what I am teaching, to be warned. The problem is that they are not using or looking at what GOD taught, they are following the traditions of man.<br>  <br>   Many people are stubborn in that they believe what they were taught is the right way and even Holy scripture can not change those views. They see it as an attack on their religion instead of a desire to help them see the truth of God's word. They are taught that they will receive persecution for being a Christian and expect it even from other Christians. They view this as just another persecution.<br>  <br>   There are also those people who have come to love playing and doing their own will on Sabbath and if they recognize the day as being Holy, they might have to change what they are doing on that day. They worry about when they will do their shopping and how can they continue to work when their workplace demands them to work on weekends. They worry so much about what is going on in this life that they are exchanging a life with the creator. It is a huge price and I don't think they even realize they are doing it. They also have to look at what other flaws their religion might be perpetuating if they realize they have erred on such a huge matter. This is not easy for anyone to do.<br>  <br>     No, we are not saved by celebrating the sabbath. God's grace is what saves us. We must believe in Him to be saved and if we believe in Jesus, why wouldn't we want to do all that he wants of us? Especially when it is such a simple thing to do. I think that those who fight the Sabbath should possibly evaluate if they are following their religion or are they following God. Do they love God enough to care what He wants from them? The Bible says that many will come in the last days saying 'Didn't we prophesy in your name?' and Jesus will plainly tell them "Away from me,... I never knew you."<br>  <br>   This shows there will be many people who believe they are doing God's work when in reality they never took the time to get to KNOW Jesus.

Peter said in 11Peter 1st chapter that the scripture, the written word is MORE SURE than the audible voice of God.Jesus held the written word in such high regard that when his salvation and yours too hung in the balance, when eternal existence was on the line, he said." IT IS WRITTEN" three times and ran the devil off with the written word of God.<br>       Now that word has to be put in the heart by reading and speaking. It is a seed.Now there are those who worship it as a holy book and never plant it in their heart.That would be like taking a corn seed and putting it on the mantle. Worshipping that seed as a giver of food.Bowing down to it and lighting candles to it. It will not produce anything till it is put in the ground. So is the word of God.

You can burn a Bible, but you can't burn God.  You can lose a Bible, but you can't lose God.  Your Bible can be stolen, but God cannot be.<br>  <br>  However, there is nothing that we know about God that we could know apart from the His words.  The Bible is the portal through which God reveals himself to us.  The Bible is the only tangible item on earth that has anything to do with communicating with God.<br>  <br>  The term "scripture" is used interchangeably with "God" in Romans 9:17 and Galatians 3:8.<br>  <br>  Check 1 Cor. 15:2, 3, 4 - look at the last phrase in each of those verses.<br>  "...believed in vain."<br>  "...according to the scriptures."<br>  "...according to the scriptures."<br>  <br>  Since there is nothing that we can know for sure about God apart from Revelation, the scriptures are the most important thing in the life of a Christian. For without God's Words, we would not know about any of the other important things that are necessary.<br>  <br>  The living Word is hated and loved. <br>  The written Word is the same.<br>  The living Word has two natures: human and divine.<br>  The written Word is the same. <br>  The living Word is eternal.<br>  The written Word is eternal - Isa. 40:8<br>  The written word is alive - Heb. 4:12<br>  <br>  For the Christian, to know one's Bible is to know Christ.  Christ cannot be known without the Bible.  We are even "born again" and "saved" by the Word of God.<br>  <br>  1 Peter 1:23 (KJV) <br>  23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. <br>  <br>  James 1:21 (KJV) <br>  21 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. <br>  <br>  When it comes to differences between God and His Word or "words" as I like to say, I prefer to draw more connections that divisions. <br>  <br>  Here are some of my favorite passage on the subject:<br>  <br>  Job 23:12 (KJV) <br>  12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. <br>  <br>  Psalm 119:9 (KJV) <br>  9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word. <br>  <br>  Psalm 119:16-17 (KJV) <br>  16 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word. <br>  17 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word. <br>  <br>  Psalm 119:28 (KJV) <br>  28 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word. <br>  <br>  Psalm 119:42 (KJV) <br>  42 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word. <br>  <br>  John 15:3 (KJV) <br>  3 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. <br>  <br>  Ephesians 5:26 (KJV) <br>  26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, <br>  <br>  Psalm 12:6-7 (KJV) <br>  6 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. <br>  7 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. <br>  <br>  Proverbs 30:5-6 (KJV) <br>  5 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. <br>  6 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.|`|XL25SEVnaa	How can someone only worship His Word without worshiping the author?<br>  <br>  I think humans by nature are materialistic, so to be able to carry and refer to the Scriptures could easily be mistaken as worship only of the words and not the author.

The law in England does not specifically forbid nudity or toplessness. It forbids nudity only if someone who sees it expresses that they feel offended. So if nobody expresses an offence, nudity is not a crime. Therefore any woman could conceivably go topless anywhere in England without charge. But the fact the law does not forbid it, is not the same as expressly calling for it. And no such national law exists, or a Liverpool bye-law. Complete urban myth.<br>  <br>  Another amusing one is reputedly from a US city, I forget which one, saying that nobody must detonate a nuclear device in the city limits. Barmy.

I didn't say anything and paid for the groceries and laughed to myself on the way to the car.
nS7koC7Oaa	Jinn are the opposite being, they share us the Earth but they are invisible, they are created from a special type of fire which is mixed with black smoke.

Read the articles below for detailed information.<br>  <br>  Having a jinn could be very dangerous.  It would be better to avoid the company of a person who spent a lot of time with the jinn.  Stories of demonic possession are probably about dealings with the jinn.|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	Jinns are the other life form that Allah created out of smokeless fire, who also have free will.

We are not to interact with the jinn and there is no reason to be afraid of them if you try to keep seperate for them. Leave them to themselves and you to yourself. Satan is also a jinn and has his evil followers/devils. <br>  <br>  Well I'm sure having a jinn inside someone isn't the greatest thing to have. That is why, Islamically we may recite Quran to avoid the evil jinns. <br>  <br>  That's about all I know.|`|03Xx7l8Baa	We do know that they are made from smokeless fire, or pure flame, that they've been given free will (just like man), they can go through walls, they can see us, but we can't see them, they can also go near the heavens and eavesdrop on what the angels say about what commands they have been given, and then go to the fortune tellers, etc, and give them the news which in then turn they pretend to 'see the future' after added a hundred more lies made up to the news they've received.<br>  <br>  Jinns have been given free will. They were created before man, in the Quran we know that the devil was a jinn worshiping God amongst the angels. But when God created Adam and told everyone to prostrate to him, they all did (angels have no free will, always good and obey God's orders) except the devil. Proof of free will?! Anyway, there is a surah (chapter 72) also in the Quran called Al-Jinn. Read it sometime.<br>  <br>  Some Jinns are Muslims, some are pagans, some follow other religions. <br>  <br>  Some jinns are good and some are bad. Just like some people are good and some are bad. Some worship Allah, pray and fast, etc like we do, and some don't. <br>  <br>  It's also known that jinns are used in black magic and fortune tellers use them. Black magic, magic, fortune telling, etc are forbidden in Islam. Anyone claiming to be using one or has one is not a follower of Islam and has gotten himself in trouble...<br>  <br>  Anyway I guess it could get kinda creepy to think there's another creature or species living with us and we are the ones who can't see them. But there are supplications that have been given to us to help and protect us.|`|9BfI7N55aa	Jin Are from those  Allah's creations Who are made by fire . <br>  they live on trees and have very long height and life . they jinns are also religious like us .|`|ORbFRn4oaa	The correct word is "Jinn".<br>  <br>  God created Jinns with fire. They were created before the creation of humans. They are allies of Devil (Satan). <br>  <br>  Every human has a soul of Jinn within himself. This Jinn advocates evil to the human. When the man dies, the Jinn is freed and lives for many more centuries. Unlike humans, the Jinns have more capabilities than humans. They can fly into outer space. They can travel at great speeds. Some of them can do some extra ordinary things as well.<br>  <br>  If you read the bible, you will see the phrase "possessed by the demon". Casted the demon out. The demons in these cases are the Jinns.<br>  <br>  Of course such cases are very rare NOW !!! though not zero.<br>  <br>  But no need to be scared. The Jinns that can really interfere with the humans are very very small in number. They need to be exceptionally strong and knowledgeable to do so.|`|AA10589890	It's a creation like mankind in that they're accountable for their actions and deeds. They can be virtuous or rebellious. The word means conceal, cover. We don't see them, usually, but they can watch us.<br>  <br>  Jinn (Hebrew: Gnn) doesn't mean shaytaan. A shaytaan (satan/devil) is any adversarial spirit, whether Jinn or man.<br>  <br>  As for demon possession, black magic, etc..those stories come from outside the Qur'an, which shows them to be a means of deceit.|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	They are superstitious nonsense.

I can't say which one is the most racist . There are Racist people everywhere, and from all walks of life. Of course you will have people saying whites are more racist, but they haven't done anything more racist than any other groups of people that are doing racist things in other countries right now.|`|OZjlW5utaa	Why would you ask a question like this?

Finally, the one that can't help but call me "boy", "n*gger", "jungle bunny" everytime they don't agree with my views.....the white race.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, i am 1/2 white, but that's just how i feel.

With one exception however, and that is to beg your pardon, and ask that you please understand that there is one Texan on here that is trying to make his way across the cow lot of life with out stepping in the wrong spot but that he is not always  as successful as he might hope to be. Sometimes he iinadvertently puts his foot right in the middle of it and for this he humble ask for your forgiveness. Humbleness ain't one of his  strong suites either, but he tries sometimes.
UH1ipgJmaa	Read Psalms........David has written some inspirational Psalms while running away from Saul|`|f3nwI8ytaa	David used common sense to run from Saul.  His faith was trusting God to take care of him whether or not he got away.<br>  <br>  peace<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  David was not a Christian.  He was a faithful Jew.  Trying to make him out to be a sort of proto-Christian is a gigantic exegetical error.|`|fef74a49262aeb6b0c117a7c8734c355aa	Saul was tryng to kill David. Almost got him with a spear i believe it was. David ran, kind of like when I stepped out of the way from that bus travelling down the steet. Psalm 110:1David believed concerning Jesus as his promised, future ‘descendent, who would ascend the TRUE throne (not an earthly throne), seeing that David wrote the psalm that says, “The Lord (Yahweh) said to MY (David’s future Lord) Lord, sit here at My (Yahweh’s) right hand, until…” Also Psalm 22 when David repents of his sin. Both good indicators that David was a Christian. Also the bible says "David was man after God's own heart."|`|sKXzYvaRaa	I feel sorry for your education if you are doing work in school such as "I have to prove how one person from Hebrews 11 is a Christian."<br>  <br>  My suggestion would be to demand your parents put you in a school that sticks to academics.|`|YH6Ja07eaa	Several times David could have killed King Saul, but David had faith not just in God, but in God's word; "don't kill Saul".

Unless you want your culture associated with something like that.|`|ncdTxID9aa	Vanilla Ice hasn't done hip hop for years, he made it clear he is more of a rock image.  As far as people mimicking genres of music, it's not so apparent, but a lot of artist seem fake in their personal connection with certain music that they produce, in which it's not their decision to be that image but their producers. A lot of times, artist are talented but have no image, so they are created one.|`|AA11634270	No, it's every white artist singing R and B, blues, rock, jazz, even country...there is a huge black influence in all these.

There's nothing wrong with having friends from all races but when you exclude your own race you are being self hating and close minded. I knew a woman like that. She hated being black and avoided black people.She was the saddest, most pitiful person and she did not end up well.|`|ncdTxID9aa	I don't care, I would only find it fake if a person tries to educate others on Blacks and their relations with each other if they have no relation with blacks themselves.

My guess is her whole life reflects her carelessness and disrepsect.  My guess is that she probably has legal problems as result of nonconformation just like at work.

Artist most of them like people to relate to them and then some do what their producers feel will catch the audience, since not all artist have a necessary voice in the matter of how they want to represent themselves.  Some are even in the music business for the money.  There are music genres like hip hop, and pop in danger of loosing the originality and creativity of the music because of some artist who don't relate to others or bring a sort of fake persona into their music.  So some people like real music, and some people like different music over others.  It all depends on how people relate to it.|`|H6CPJ5LPaa	the white people i know love hip hop & rap|`|AA11350561	I don't exactly know where your getting your statistic from. How can you say the majority of Caucasians do not like rap and hip hop. Have you done a census on music preferences in the United States? I'm going to say no. You should probably grow up and use your brain next time you ask a question. How are you going to say that you love all people, and then say "but i don't like pieces of sh**." You must be absolutely retarded. You contradict yourself and can't even propose a valid statement. How are you going to ask the "whites" to stop judging against a prejudice that they've grown up into? How are you going to ask the "blacks" to do the same thing? Maybe caucasians are not just used to rap yet, as with any newer style of music jazz in the early 20th, hard rock, or even techno. And besides, as a 17 year old CAUCASIAN who listens to lots of rap, I can't even understand what some of the rappers are saying half the time.

That is not right.|`|YF92atEoaa	You are not more evolved...You just have different taste and preference then straight people and theres nothing wrong with that.

No. Odd question.|`|jcXSNjowaa	no.|`|K1rUaOqWaa	yes exactly its weird, be yourself because you have dick and your a man|`|4Toiq62eaa	"I have a penis... yet I want more penis" LOL!!<br>  Homosexuality isn't just about having a penis and wanting penis.<br>  I agree with you on people not understanding, it's only natural for them not to understand. I find homosexuality to be an oddity of the same nature as being left handed, or being a black person attending a college with only an 8.5% black population. It isn't necessarily bad, just... abnormal... that word has negative connotations, but that's literally what we are, a deviation from what is 'normal'. Mind you, being abnormal does not equate to being unnatural. I'm bi, and I understand that there are people on both sides of the spectrum that wouldn't understand, and find it peculiar, and I'm OK with that. I'm not any less comfortable being bi than I am being those other two things.|`|Y4v2tm3Naa	While I dont understand people that are gay being straight, historically it's not as uncommon as people seem to believe it. In ancient greece and rome even straight men did what was concidered homosexual now.  It is even present in some primate populations as well as other animals as a show of dominance.  Looking at steers in a feed lot often times you will see them mounting each other and they no longer have the equipment to reproduce.|`|aolTChwdaa	Being gay is not weird or unnatural, nor does it mean you are more evolved.  yes there are theories that claim homosexuality is natures way of coping with the human over population, although there has always been gay people, even before the world was over populated.<br>  <br>  Plus, there is evidence of homosexuality in most species, in fact i believe all animals have members who take part in sex with others of the same gender.  <br>  <br>  Therefore, homosexual tendencies from a primate or animal perspective is natural.<br>  <br>  Its man, who because of reasons such as the bible, has made the assumption that being gay is unnatural or worst of all a sin, which in my opinion is not true.<br>  <br>  not to mention, there is more and more evidence showing that you are born with your sexuality.|`|JciRlsWEaa	The way i see it bro, be who you are.

It has to do with the Second Amendment to the US Constitution ensuring American people of the right to keep and bear arms and it is all about defense.|`|TQVMAZUbaa	If you're asking the question seriously, I'll give you the serious answer.<br>  <br>  It's because our Founding Fathers felt that it was important that we have the ability to protect ourselves from our government.|`|AA12136312	I do NOT believe everyone should have the right to own a gun.

In fact, if you have committed a felony in this country you lose your right of gun ownership.  Mostly, I think it relates to the idea for hunting for ones food like they used to on the frontier in colonial america, and then if most people owned guns and we had a foreign invader or had to go to war we would have a home militia with guns as a reserve.  however, other than guns used for hunting, I think they should get rid of them personally, but the problem is once they take away the pistols and assault rifles then where will it stop.... and everyone that uses them for hunting is afraid it won't stop...|`|16ce5c8b2b4e1c765742c42329522cc5aa	Everyone should not own  a gun.  Here are a few examples of people who shouldnt have guns: pedophiles, bank robbers, mentally unbalanced people with anger issues, rapists, burgulars, gang members, various kinds of robbers..................|`|khdFNlJ7aa	Because we have a right to bear arms, what if our country is invaded somehow? Well, that sounds far fetched, but if something like that were to happen you would have a gun to protect yourself, and against criminals that might want to intend harm on you. Mainly we have had the right to bear arms, because of the Revolutionary War, the English would go and try to take over American Family houses.|`|Mfy5gd77aa	im not american but i believe that everyone has the right to do or have anything as long as it does not affect anyone else negatively. having a gun for instance i think is ok but using one on someone is not. i do think that the law over their is stupid though because its illegal to shoot someone but not illegal to own fire arms. i think that internationally fire arms that don't have a practical pacifistic use should be banned.|`|YTasscmKaa	Its a tool for personal protection and the acquisition of food.

Americans believe in the individual and his/her right to make fundamental choices about his/her life.|`|215646253ac5e0903ab28bc43e031fd3aa	owning a gun also means you need to know gun safety..<br>  <br>  you will never take away americans right to bear arms.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	First, to be precise, not every American can own a gun.  First, you have to be of age (depending on the state you live in) and secondly, you must not have been convicted of a felony or have been legally adjudged to be mentally unstable or deficient.  <br>  <br>  Secondly, I own firearms because I hunt, and also for self defense.  I carry a handgun on me most of the time, and when it's not on me, it joins the other firearms in my house in a heavy, fireproof safe.  <br>  <br>  I am a former Marine, and am well trained in the use of firearms.  I have taught my children firearms safety and trained them in the responsible use of firearms as they've grown old enough.  I'm not at all worried about my kids getting into my gun case.<br>  <br>  Moreover, I have had to defend a woman I love with my sidearm, and without it, there's every reason to believe that she, and possibly I and our children, would be dead.  <br>  <br>  Look, I am a supporter of responsible gun ownership, and at the same time, I have to admit that there are a lot of unstable, stupid gun owners out there, and that lots of folks who currently own guns probably shouldn't.  On the other hand, I am certainly glad that I do posses firearms.  Without them, we would have to rely upon meat farms and industrial food supplies for our meat, and our food budget would be hit very hard, and additionally, it's pretty certain that a woman I love deeply would have been killed by a deranged and enraged man.  <br>  <br>  There ya go.|`|aaRMPDIDaa	I don't think everyone should have the right to own a gun...Not convicted felons!  I think everyone has the right to protect themselves and their family, and if that means owning gun, then it means owning a gun.  <br>  <br>  I am personally quite afraid of guns, but sometimes I think they are necessary.|`|Onzxe6ysaa	To protect yourselves from the people with guns, whether it be criminals or cops. Here in NY it's easier to get a gun illegally than it is to get one legally. That is scary. The people who are breaking into homes can easily get a gun. The people with homes and a family to protect can't get guns to do so.|`|GPznIhzMaa	I don't believe in it at all. What do we pay the police for? The right to bear arms is outdated.

How many guns do we need before more innocent people get killed?|`|AA11506593	Everyone? No.<br>  <br>  Every law abiding, adult, legal US citizen?

SzqeeUxgaa	It means the anger in your mind and intentions, thinking and possible actions ~!<br>  <br>  Am I crazy?? I really need to know that ..hmmmm
fabhI1cSaa	"Fire in the hole" is a warning used in the United States, indicating that an explosive detonation in a confined space is imminent.<br>  <br>  It originated with miners, who needed to warn their fellows that a charge had been set. The first cannons were discharged, shot or exploded by placing a flaming torch to a small hole packed with gunpowder and leading to the main powder charge. This caused the main charge to explode, propelling the cannon ball to the enemy, or sometimes, blowing up the cannon and all standing nearby.<br>  <br>  Hence, “fire in the hole” was both a command to the torch man, and a warning to all around. Over time cannons improved; they became safer, with no hole or fire needed. The command was reduced to “fire”, while the term “fire in the hole” became a general warning for the use of explosive weapons.|`|Q4MqzxX7aa	What? Fire in the hole means you are going to throw a bomb at a bunker. Or other such "fire" in a hole or space of some kind|`|sKXzYvaRaa	It is from mining... if you are blasting in a mine then you are creating a "fire in the hole".|`|s7pqFa1eaa	It indicates that the fuse has been lit.|`|P9U0EdzDaa	The morning after a spicey curry.|`|FJZIvANFaa	I would use it if im throwing something Lmao :)|`|0soaWkXOaa	STD / STI or what ever you call it|`|UH1ipgJmaa	In Military sense it means, "To throw the grenade."<br>  <br>  When you throw a bomb it called, "Flat Face"|`|yDJiiqcsaa	The origin of that phrase was as Floid said.  It has been used since then for other applications (war demolition or generally that actions have been initiated that can't be undone) but the origin was in mining.

"Anyone" is considered by many people, including me, to be somewhat more acceptable for formal writing, although there are those who disagree.  As for myself, I use anybody mostly for emphasis, e.g., Doesn't anybody care that the poor dog is hungry?  But I would say, "Can anyone give me a ride to the party?"

The one restriction I can think of would be that if you're contrasting them, like "Anybody can read it, but nobody can understand it," then you would use the same suffix for the contrasted forms. In formal written English, there are sometimes standards preferring one or the other but they tend to be regional preferences and are not usually taken very seriously.

Your friends are in the car laughing having a good time, when all of a sudden you see flashing lights in the rearview. You look down to check if you're speeding and you're sure you're not speeding. You check your tags (if your state has them) and they are fine...You pull over and wait for the officer and listen to your friends ask you "WTF man? what did you do?"<br>  <br>  The police officer starts yelling at you and the passengers to get out of the car, and out your hands behind your head.  You want to ask so bad, 'what did i do?' but you know the officer will ignore you...'<br>  <br>  <br>  the officer asks you where you got the car<br>  you tell him you bought it from a friend<br>  he asks you what friend<br>  you tell him your friends name<br>  the cops don't believe you and take you to jail anyways<br>  as they take your mugshot before putting you in the cell for the night, tell me,.......WOULD YOU SMILE???<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ugh.|`|pabVvxylaa	I think there are a few celebrity mug shots that have smiles in them. but of the most part when you get arrested and you are getting your mugshot taken you really don't feel like smiling.

It matters.<br>  <br>  You are on the internet yet you don't mention having internet service when you move out.  Are you also planning to give up cable TV?  You also forgot about medical and dental insurance, household cleaners, bath items, and car maintenance (tires, oil changes, etc.).  Will you need to go to a laundermat?  Check the prices to wash and dry and figure out how many loads you have a week (don't forget the detergent and softeners).  Do you have a budget for clothing--or at least shoes?  You can shop in thrift stores for clothes if needed but shoes are generally considered a necessity.<br>  <br>  $100 a month for food is WAY too low.  At least double that amount.<br>  <br>  Depending on your job, your medical insurance might be expensive or have a high deductible.

Learning by yourself will not work. You'll teach yourself incorrect, inaccurate, and incomplete information.<br>  However, if you expect your child to pick it up too you won't be able to teach her because the Japanese you'll speak won't be 100% correct. You would need a Japanese-speaking nanny to spend a lot of time with your child. For the language to stick she would have to be with your family for years and years (because you and your husband won't grasp Japanese quickly enough to just have her for a year and then be able to take over from there).|`|hexzaIGgaa	Belie: With very hard work...studying by yourself DOES work.

FOzN3xwzaa	NO.<br>  <br>  When you believe in Jesus alone for salvation, then you are forgiven ALL SINS past, present, and future.  ALL SAVED BELIEVERS ARE STILL SINNERS.<br>  <br>  So relax  :)  Jesus loves you so very much, and He died on the cross to pay for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead.  If you believe this, then you will NEVER be sent to hell, no matter what  :)  So have peace.  <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|V56SnI1Eaa	The answer to your question is in prayer.  Tell Him just what your are feeling and ask for His help. Yes, he does forgive all our sins. Even more cool is that God knows what is in our hearts.  So even tho we are human through and through - witness your cussing - he knows when we truly repent even tho are actions do not always conform.  I think each one of us struggles more with some sins than others.  Read your Bible, talk to God and believe what He promises.|`|psw67HT1aa	That you are concerned about this at all shows that you have a good conscience developed.  I think alot of people have problems with foul language, not that that makes it ok.

The Holy Spirit is what helps you to live right:<br>  <br>  17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. <br>  2 Cor 5:17 (KJV)<br>  <br>             <br>  HERE IS HOW YOU CALL UPON THE LORD<br>  <br>  Do you admit that you are a GUILTY sinner under the condemnation of God's LAW, deserving of Hellfire?<br>  <br>  Do you believe that Jesus is the Son of God (God in the flesh) who died upon the cross, sacrificing His precious blood to pay for your sins?<br>  <br>  All you need to do to be saved is to BELIEVE upon the Lord Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you'd feel comfortable praying a sinner's prayer as did the publican in Luke 18:13... "And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner."<br>  <br>      Dear Jesus,<br>      I admit that I am a sinner, deserving of Hell.  Please forgive me of my sins and take me to Heaven when I die.  I now believe upon You alone, apart from all works and religion, as my personal Savior.  Thank you.  Amen.<br>  <br>  Just as you were born physically to your parents, you were born spiritually into the Family of God when you believed on Jesus! (John 3:3).  Please understand that we are not saved because we pray a prayer; but because we believe upon the Lord Jesus Christ.  It is certainly appropriate to ask the Lord in prayer to forgive and save us; but it is our faith which prompted us to pray the prayer.  You could just as easily believe in your heart upon the Lord to be saved, and not pray at all.  Salvation is of the heart, as we read in Romans 10:10, "For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness..."<br>  <br>  You do NOT have to be baptized or doing anything to go to Heaven other than trust upon the Lord as your Savior.  Romans 4:5 proclaims... "But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness."  The only sin which can prevent a person from being saved is UNBELIEF.  Thus, unbelief is the only sin which a person needs to repent of to be saved.  What a wonderful Savior!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/how_to_be_saved.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/how_to_be...</a>|`|WYk0zYdhaa	Girl, first of all you are not alone!  We live in a world of much sin and depravity and it's hard!  God promises that He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you can bear but keep in mind this means as long as we depend on Him.  These sins that you say keep going on over and over... God will give you a way out but you have to be willing to accept that help.  We can't do it alone!  You may even need support from someone that you trust as an accountabilty partner.  There is nothing wrong with asking for help and shows more dedication than ignoring it you know?    It sounds like you have a lot of stumbling blocks in your life such as your bro swearing.  The fact that you recognize this and don't want it shows more maturity in the Lord!  Pray for these to be removed and talk to God, let Him know how you feel, you are feeling lost but He is our rock!   He is there for you and will carry you if u let Him!<br>  As for being perfect no one but Christ is.  Good thing we are not saved by good works huh?  What does it mean to you to be a Christian?  I fear that so many of us misunderstand what that truly means.    When we follow Christ and learn about Him it helps us to put away old things.  Meaning sin less and love Him more!  It sometimes takes time and we strive to not sin but it's a life long process.  <br>  <br>  Sounds like you need some help on this walk and I would encourage you to speak to your youth pastor, a sister in Christ or someone that you trust.  I would be happy to talk with you... it's what I do lol.  I'm not perfect either trust me, but as I make mistakes I learn and God is able to use those mistakes to help me in my faith and personal walk as well as help others.  When we are able to learn it helps us to discontinue.  That feeling of guilt is there because we know its wrong and it's not a good feeling to have.  The good thing is that having accepted Christ we know that we are forgiven!  Does that make sense so fear not, keep your faith and know that following God will all work out even when it seems there is little or no hope. <br>  <br>  Hell is real yes but try not to be worried about it.  I can't stand it when people try to bring others to Christ with a scare tactic... that's not what it's about.  Just repent when you feel you have done something against God.  Feel the freedom and weight lifted off and ask the Lord to help you resist the next time.  Whatever it is, I heard a great saying, "the best way to not get hit by a train is to stay off the tracks." lol so true... I mean if it's a TV show that you feel is keeping you from God then take a break from TV and start a routine of something else at that hour.  It helps :)  <br>  <br>  If it's the urge to swear first remind people around you that it's offensive to you and please not to do it when you're around (sometimes they will comply).  Then try memorizing a verse to say in your head next time you want to use a bad word.  Or come up with some funny replacement words... that can be a lot of fun lol.  We have done both.  Snigglfritz is one that I say.  My four year old says, "oh pooey!"<br>  my husband had all kinds of funny things.  <br>  <br>   I talk to people all the time that feel the same way and I was there too!  Anyway I'm here if you want to talk.  <br>  <br>  In the meantime I will pray for you.  All is well in the Lord!  <br>  <br>  Blessings :)|`|pw4Cb45Kaa	1  Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.<br>   2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.<br>   3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.<br>   4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.<br>   5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive?a? me.<br>   6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.<br>   <br>   The Holy Bible  : King James Version. electronic ed. of the 1769 edition of the 1611 Authorized Version.

No one gets it right, especially not at age thirteen.  I'd stick with it, at least until you're eighteen, and then you can start exploring other faiths if practicing Christianity hasn't worked out.|`|TzY9vkinaa	Theres no temptation that is too hard for you to overcome.<br>  <br>  <br>  1 Cor. 10: 13<br>    13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.|`|FkdEyXudaa	How do you suck at it! Christianity isn't a job! Lol Now I undertand that you wanna be a better person. Just Ask God to help you and he will.|`|8pQrIL90aa	Where all these kids coming from? Come on now you are way too young to feel this way. you are shouldering far too much for a child. Go tell your mother how you feel.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Sweetie... we ALL suck at being Christian.<br>  <br>  Remember St. Peter denied that he even knew Jesus...THREE TIMES. If you feel you are doing a rather poor job of being a Christian, then you are in pretty good company.  The people who are in real trouble are the ones who DON'T think they suck at being a Christian, they are falling for the sin of pride.<br>  <br>  Christians aren't perfect, they are just forgiven.  EVERYBODY has problems. If you read anything written by the Saints, you will soon see that they too all had problems along the way.<br>  <br>  Being a good Christian isn't a goal, you don't wake up one morning and say "Well, I'm finally a good Christian, now I can check that box, cross it off my list, and start on climbing Mount Everest."  That's not how it works. It's like a joke my Uncle Jim used to tell..."As soon as I get this humility thing down, I'll finally be absolutely perfect."|`|23bgwpD1aa	everybody struggles, you are not alone. We live under grace and only God can judge us. He looks at our hearts. If you really start to examine the people in the Bible they could be considered pretty messed up too. David was committed adultery and murder and was still considered a man after God's own heart.|`|PSk0zY5uaa	hell isnt real so you dont have to worry about that<br>  haha, swearing isnt that big of a deal really (though you shouldn't do it) im glad you're trying to get close to god, this might help you<br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/</a>|`|AA12359663	Don't give up.<br>  Christianity is all about having a relationship with Christ.<br>  Like any 'good relationship' it takes work.<br>  <br>  God knows we're not going to be perfect, but IF we keep making GENUINE attempts to be the BEST that we can be, and if we FAITHFULLY attempt to commune with him (prayer and bible study) and if we do our best to obey...<br>  <br>  Than He'll honor it - Because He's a God of Grace.<br>  <br>  (please take one precaution though: Just because He's a God of Grace, don't think He is going to keep giving grace to those, who are insincere in their attempts. Sincerity goes a long way)<br>  <br>  Every Christian feels like this at times, by the way.<br>  Take consolation in that.<br>  <br>  Seek support from fellow Christians, and continue to prayer.<br>  God will get you through.<br>  <br>  P.S. Ignore atheists. They have no idea what they are talking about.|`|Z8UjcLKJaa	You are never doomed. God says bring to me the children for unto them the heavens belong. If you ask for forgiveness God really means it when He says He forgives you. You should pray. It's hard being a christian in the present days. Live your life to it's fullest, make Jesus your friend. Get Him involved in your life. Talk to Him like you talk to your friends but with respect. Life's hard for a teenager. School, friends, bullies that kinda stuff. Just forget of it all and be the best you can be.|`|h07uBpjNaa	You seem like you are very mature for your age. It's good that you are thinking seriously about these issues. You are struggling with stuff that's common to all of us, so don't panic just yet. The good news is that we're all terrible at it. It takes Jesus to make us right.<br>  <br>  Whether we go to hell or not does not depend on what we do. Heaven or hell is dictated by what we decide about Jesus. Are we following Him as our Lord and Savior? If so, our heavenly destination is set and no amount of sin can keep us from there.<br>  <br>  The early church struggled with this concept. There were some who figured that if they were saved by Jesus they could just go out and sin as much as they wanted to. The apostle Paul wrote, "May it never be!" We should not go on sinning. If we do, we cut ourselves off from daily fellowship with God because sin interferes with the communication and relationship between us and Him.<br>  <br>  The other question we must consider is this: If we go on sinning, are we really saved by Jesus in the first place? Being saved by Jesus is not just the saying of a prayer or making a head choice. Being saved by Jesus comes from the heart and produces a heart change. We must admit that we are sinners who are totally incapable of being good enough to go to heaven. We have to repent (turn away from) these sins and live a new way. At the moment of salvation, a process called "sanctification" begins where we get more and more like Jesus as time goes by. (Yeah, there are bad days when we go in reverse, but overall the progress should be positive.) If we didn't make this heart change and can't see that we're getting better over time then maybe we didn't actually get saved in the first place.<br>  <br>  Some practical advice:<br>  <br>  1) Ask your brother not to swear in your presence. I hope he's not a jerk about it and honors your request. Tell him how you're picking up on the language and you'd rather not.<br>  <br>  2) Find some Jesus-following friends. I'm not talking about the kids who go to youth group just to be seen or go to church just because their parents make them. You need to hang out with the real deal, with some people who know Jesus and can help you live more like him. Your youth pastor might be able to point these people out to you.<br>  <br>  3) If you're not attending a Bible-believing, Jesus-glorifying church, find one and start attending. At 13 you're at the mercy of people with driver's licenses, but I pray you'll be able to find someone to take you.<br>  <br>  4) Avoid the situations that lead you to sin. Usually we *know* ahead of time what situations are liable to lead us down the path to sin. Don't put yourself in those situations. If you tend to sin when you are alone in your room, get out into the kitchen or living room. If you tend to sin when you are one-on-one dating, stop one-on-one dating. Stuff like that.<br>  <br>  I hope you find something useful in all this.|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	Well, I'm assuming you've asked Christ to be your Lord and Savior. <br>  <br>  The Bible promises:<br>  2 Corinthians 5:17  Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!<br>  <br>  and:<br>  John 15:4  Remain in me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.<br>  <br>  <br>  So...focus on being "in Christ". Pray and read your Bible daily. It will change you. Pray all the time! He really wants you to know Him. <br>  <br>  Also, be transformed!<br>  Romans 12:2  Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.<br>  <br>  How are we transformed?<br>  Joshua 1:8  Do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.<br>  <br>  If you haven't read the Bible before, start in John. Read a chapter a day and keep going to the end.<br>  <br>  P.S. As far as swearing. When I was a teenager, I was told to just say, "ice cream!" instead of a swear word. It was kind of a joke, but it seems to work.|`|yB0nVXfWaa	My dear, you are only 13.  You are very, very young - so cut yourself some slack, will you?  Hey, no need to do satan's work for him, you're still a kid and you just haven't lived very long at all.  Don't get so heavy.  Relax, and trust God.<br>  <br>  Don't you know, you can't, absolutely can't, love God and please him in your own strength?  You're bound to fail - everyone does, too.  There's no way you can be good and not sin, just by screwing yourself, using all your determination and willpower, etc.  It just won't work, because you are relying on your own resources, and that's not how to live the Christian life.  <br>  <br>  That's the Old Testament way, but the New Testament way gives us help from the Holy Spirit, don't you know?  My dear, you surely mean well, and God also, surely knows that.<br>  <br>  The world could end tomorrow?  Well, I don't think so, actually, because even though the Word says things are going to get worse and worse (now don't worry about it, just learn), before the world ends is a long time to go.  Tho' Jesus could come at any time for his church, after that there'd be at least 7 years before the end of the age, and then after that there'd be at least another 1,000 years until the end of the world, but that'd only be while God remakes it.  <br>  <br>  Bit complicated, but the main thing is, listen and learn and do not worry about it.  Have faith in God.  God knows what he's doing and he hears every one of your prayers and sighs.  He knows the intentions of your heart and what you are trying to do.  He has not forgotten you.<br>  <br>  What you need is to be born again.  That means, to repent and turn to Jesus as your Lord and Saviour.  Then get baptized.  Do all these things, and you will receive the Holy Spirit.  Then you will have power over sin, to begin to overcome.  It'll come, have faith.  And if you sin and learn slowly, remember the Word says he will forgive 70 x 7 (that means always).<br>  <br>  You are quite an innocent girl, and also one with very intense and pure motives, if what you have written is really you.  Just put your life right with God by conversion and you will be okay.  Your feet will have started on the 'narrow' road and, should you sin or fall from grace, you know you can always put it right by repentance, don't you?  And you will gain confidence and you will progress in holiness, don't worry, for God will be on your side, and with you every step of the way.<br>  <br>  If those swear words come into your head, well, just refuse them, and utter a little 'arrow prayer' to the Lord, saying something like 'Lord, help me'.  It's hard to resist when there's swearing all around you every day, but make it an opportunity to call upon God for help and you will turn a bad thing into a good thing and overcome evil with good, as the Word says.<br>  <br>  Don't worry now, God is on your case.  Keep on praying to him, for he loves such dear hearts as yours.|`|yDJiiqcsaa	Jesus loves us in spite of the sins.  We only lose His love by our fleeing from Him.  Turn to Him often during the day and instead of wallowing in your guilt, thank God for His love and forgiveness. If you are aware of sinning, ask for His forgiveness and ask for His grace to improve, but THANK Him for loving you eventhough you are weak/sin.  Guilt can be good or it can be bad. It can be good if it reminds us to try to avoid the same sin.  It is bad if you feel that sin is stronger than God's love and forgiveness and it causes you to want to give up. Thank God that His love is greater than our sins.  Get up and try again.  As long as you get up and try again once more than the number of times you fail - you are ok.  Also, recognize that around your age there is a lot going on in your body chemistry that is changing and it is VERY common that these changes can make you FEEL depressed.  Feelings are neither right nor wrong - they are just emotions.  Actions can be right or wrong. Don't confuse FEELING down/guilty with BEING guilty. Jesus paid the price for our sins. Everytime you sin - RUN back to Him and thank Him for His renewed forgiveness and constant love.  If you are Catholic go to confession often so that you can audibly HEAR the words of absolution that God is giving. God forgives us our sins but it is nice to HEAR those words of reassurance that we have been forgiven.  It is reassuring that a person (priest) can hear our sins and not go running away, screaming in horror that we have been so bad - but mostly that we can hear the words that Jesus gave them - "whose sins you shall forgive they are forgiven".   Either way, know that God forgives and loves as long as we will return to Him and confess and accept His love. The tragedy of Judas was not in His betrayal of Christ - it was his assessment/doubt that Christ could/would forgive Him had he asked for forgiveness - he precluded the forgiveness of God.  Had he gone to the foot of the cross and asked the dying Lord for forgiveness,  we most likely would have churches named "St. Judas of Kerioth "  today.

They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good. <br>  Psalms 14:1 (KJV)<br>  <br>  20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are WITHOUT EXCUSE: <br>  Romans 1:20 (KJV)<br>  <br>  Don't miss the last part of the verse... SO THAT THEY ARE WITHOUT EXCUSE!  You have no excuse!  Biblically, there is NO such thing as an atheist.  In the early stages of a child's life, they recognize that there must be a God, a Divine Creator.  It is public school brainwashing, with the lies of Evolution, that blind children to the truth.  I want you to think about something, which if you'll be honest, PROVES that evolution is a lie.  Here's the thought... children must be taught Evolution or they would never believe such nonsense.  A child who sees, hears, feels, touches, and tastes God's creation doesn't need to be taught that there's a Divine Creator.  It is obvious knowledge!  Evolution must be taught, because nothing in nature supports it's claims, i.e., it doesn't come natural.

1Vih78dZaa	The extract is from the "Spiritual Exercises" written by Ignatius Loyola (1491-1556), founder of the Jesuits (whose proper name is the Society of Jesus).<br>  <br>  What I understand him to say in the quote is that we are all predestined to either be saved or damned. In other words, whether we end up in heaven or hell is known to God from the time of our birth and there's nothing we can do about that.<br>  <br>  He goes on to say that this should not be spoken of since, if people know that they'll end up in heaven no matter how many bad things they do during their life, then they either won't bother to do good or they'll believe that they're going to heaven because they have done good, not because God wants them there.<br>  <br>  What Loyola does not say (Jesuits are justly known for weasel arguments) is that the other side of this false coin is that those who are predestined to be damned will go to hell no matter what they do.|`|ZhNCvhqSaa	People, you are missing the point. There does not need to be a chapter number or book number. Explain the passage as it stands.<br>  <br>  i.e.: Your fate in the religious afterlife is predetermined. It doesn't matter what you do in this life. But no-one is allowed to say that, in case god gets pissed off, and changes his mind about the one saying it. If we suggest too strongly on the other hand that charitable works can 'grease the wheels' so to speak, and perhaps change gods mind and give you a higher chance of getting into heaven, then god may also get pissed, because he may think you are trying to marginalise his power and absolute decisions in the minds of his followers.<br>  <br>  So basically, preachers, don't let them know that whatever they do, they have no chance of changing their likelihood of getting into heaven, but feel free to suggest to them that they should do some charitable works. Just don't go overboard with it.<br>  <br>  Another example of the church treating their followers like sheep. Or mushrooms. Yep, mushrooms.

The writer here does not fully understand the difference and trys to integrate both beliefs as compatible with one another- which makes his statements very confusing. God grace is soverign and based solely occording to the council of His own will. Eph. 1 All events in history are predestined and orchestated by an all knowing all powerful God, even the events of saving humans. Free willism says that man is the *ultimate cause* the *deciding factor* of his salvation. This is not biblical and not in line with the doctrine predestination. It is like this... man *chooses* so accept God with his will but it is God who has caused this choice by opening their eyes and giving them a new heart. God has mercy on whom He will have mercy. If God did not regenerate them they would never be inclined to serve God and place their faith in them. At the point when the Holy Spirit makes you alive in Christ that person instantly believes. cause and effect. If man was left to decide for himelf with out being born again he would Never choose God.

Mostly white folks (I am not white, I'm hispanic).|`|G6yyceAxaa	this is actually a pretty good question.<br>  <br>  first of all, country and heavy metal musics evolved from blues. the current format of country music actually sounds like what was known as pop music in the 70's.<br>  <br>  people normally listen to music they understand. so to that point, most blacks don't identify with the subject matters in heavy metal music. things like sanitarium, (metallica) although from a purely musical format, the instruments jam.<br>  <br>  same as with country music, blacks don't identify with the subject matters. things like cross country truck drives, or "my love is deeper than a holler".|`|vbNVlcNNaa	Country doesn't appeal to me. But they have some amazing vocalist. Some of the best singers in my opinion are country singers. Metal. It's just a lot of loud banging and screaming.<br>  <br>  But there are some who actually like country and metal. Just because your black doesn't automatically mean you have to like R&B and Hiphop. It's all about preference.|`|9BUc0lgjaa	it may have to do with in going and outgoing regional fads and popularized intercity african american stereotypes? it seems odd though that those specific genres would be selected for this question, as they so vastly contrast eachother. if you dont mind taking the extra time, please email me when you learn the correct answer to this question in your class, im curious...|`|n7BuH75gaa	hahahaha.<br>  It's untrue to a certain extent.<br>  There is less african americans that like it but, they do. lol|`|CTlkMN3Faa	I like rock to some extent..but not HEAVY METAL and who likes country?

But if you go to the right places you will be surprised of how many of that race are nothing like the majority of peoples perceptions of that race are.|`|E2xIJTezaa	well its not only african-americans who dislike those two genres. believe it or not some caucasions dislike it two. but i think us black people just like music we can vibe to and that wont put us to sleep or make us feel like someones screaming at us.<br>  <br>  but there are those who do like those two genres so i cant really say for sure|`|MMTqqS8naa	i am  African American that likes heavy metal but not so much country.if it ever occurred to you that African Americans don't like a certain type of music then you have probably never lived in a African American neighborhood

Obese people get diabetes, they have respiratory problems, joint problems, blood clots, heart conditions, but at the same time anorexic people have joint problems, unhealthy bones, hair loss, vitamin deficiency, they are tired all the time, hungry all the time, etc. <br>  Both are more mental health issues than physical anyway. <br>  I've been anorexic, and I've had obese friends - it's a lose lose situation.|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	Well I am anorexic, I hate it, but I would also very much hate being overweight....so neither!|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Anorexic.

Sadly I'm obese.|`|CfZn9kK5aa	Obese. Hands down. I hate people who are anorexic/bulimic. Not hate really, but I have such immense pity for them. Anorexia is ALWAYS the individuals fault, being over weight isn't.<br>  <br>   My mother for instance, when a dip **** doctor pulled out her uterus and ovaries (with out her consent), her thyroid stopped working and she gained a lot of weight, and it took the doctors awhile to figure out why. She wasn't eating any thing different, but over the course of a month or so, she gained a lot of weight and has sense been unable to drop it, regardless of what meds she gets put on, or what she eats. She exercises, but is physically disabled, and is unable to do much.<br>  <br>   I am over weight because my thyroid is shot due to my PCOS. The traditional diets of low carbs that work for PCOS sufferers doesn't work for me, so I have been working with a nutritionist and a physical trainer to try to get my weight under control. I have to eat less than 900 calories a day to lose weight, and that is very unhealthy and borderline anorexic.<br>  <br>   Anorexia is a disorder that is always self inflicted, and will destroy your body faster than being obese will.<br>  <br>  ----<br>  Yes, people who are anorexic, CHOSE to be anorexic. Yes it is a mental disorder, but it is something they CHOSE to start. Just like bulimia.<br>  <br>  "But better than being fat. Anything is better."<br>  <br>   I suppose being 5'9" tall, weighing 75lbs, with organs shutting down due to malnutrition is better than being fat then. Oh yes, definatly. Dieing is ALWAYS better than being fat! =D<br>  <br>   If you didn't catch on, that was sarcasm.<br>  <br>   Prefering to be dead, over being fat, is part of the mental illness that is Anorexia. A mental illness that they chose to participate in. It doens't START as a mental illness, but it winds up being one.<br>  <br>  "It's not like I just decided one day that I was going to stop eating."<br>  <br>   You do not just accedentally stop eating.<br>  ----<br>  <br>   As some one who is over weight, I am happy and I love my self. Yes, I want to lose the weight to be healthier, but I love my self. Anorexics do not love them selves.

I would hate to be obese because I personally think that fat is just disgusting. He really grosses me out.<br>  <br>  And just adding my opinion to whats being said, I wouldn't say its our fault.

What is important is that whether this hadith classified as authentic or not by Ulema of Ahlus Sunnah.<br>  <br>  If she did ask she went against the saying of Mohammed PBUH and indeed she is free from what shia  associate with her.
nisfxpXHaa	Of course it was wrong for her to have been fired or not have her position renewed on the grounds of sexual orientation.<br>  <br>  However, the government is not fond of admitting to it's own underhanded discrimination. And any apology or reimbursement of attorney fees would be doing just that.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  L|`|syIp6d2Naa	It's a shame when the government won't follow the very laws they write. I really feel bad for the woman and who's business was it if she is or is not a lesbian?  I do know there are still some jobs that have a set of rules that define what they say is acceptable morals. It's like the don't ask, don't tell law. So messed up it stinks.
SzqeeUxgaa	ahhh.. doesn't matter. will just share my experience with u and inshaAllah this will help you.<br>  <br>  First keep reciting Ya Hayyu Ya Qayyum, u have no idea how much it helps.<br>  <br>  My first presentation was on micro economics. i did nothing, stood at the podium,class was sleeping and sir was smiling, i was about to cry when he asked me to get off the stage and gave me 2 points only.<br>  THAT was a hit for me...<br>  <br>  Second debate was on communication, teacher stopped in between and said, are you kidding us??? prepare yourself and come again after 2 days... I felt like DYING...  i cried for hours... i felt as if m loosing it.<br>  <br>  and then I gave my self a challenge. I told myself.. what am I afraid of?<br>  All these people sitting right in front of me get nervous too. if they are better than me then even m better than them in many other aspects.<br>  <br>  we all have to die one day, if I do something today,. 2 people will follow me tomorrow... so what am i afraid of? and above all, Allah is the best aware of ME.... I should only be afraid of his anger,. why am I bothered about these worldly people, this fake competition n all????<br>  <br>  I CAN DO  IT.. its a CHALLENGE. I WILL Do IT.<br>  <br>  <br>  and believe me brother from then onwards, I got nothing but an A+ or A for my every participation :)<br>  <br>  All the best, have confidence in yourself ~!|`|7dGpL4mSaa	I used to be the same. I would worry so much and I would talk in such a low voice, no one would hear me. But I have done it so much, I got used to it. A couple months ago, I had to say a speech. I got up and started reading my speech and I noticed that it was different. It turned out I was reading my friends speech! I was sooooo embarrassed! I said, "Umm, guys, this isn't my speech!" And everybody burst out laughing! We had a party thing at the school and everybody said that their favorite thing was me messing up. But anyways, be confident, if you mess up, make a joke out of it, it helps,really. <br>  Say bismillah, and play with your hands. It helps me to play with my hands. <br>  <br>  I don't think my story helped you, did it?|`|AA10248239	You can't eliminate it entirely.  Many people who speak in public feel tense before the event, even though they have done it hundreds of times before.<br>  <br>  You can mitigate your anxiety by preparing yourself, preparing visual aids, and practicing.  Make a list of things you think your opposition might say, and how you would answer them.  Practice in front of a mirror and/or friends or family.  Try recording your speech and then viewing it to see how you can improve.|`|kUNhq931aa	Salaam Alaykom,<br>  <br>   I have a fear of speaking in public as well. It is not fun, especially when all your major projects are to be marked on an oral examination. Most people will tell you to imagine the audience in their underwear. I would definitely have to disagree with this ideology, because not only is it haraam, but it does not seem to work (at-least in my opinion).<br>  <br>  What I do is, and this may not work for you because everyone is different,  but I always keep something small in my hands while speaking. A paper clip usually works for me. I keep fiddling and playing around with it, while I am speaking. When my hands are busy, for some reason it makes speaking so much easier for me. But PLEASE MAKE SURE not to make the "fiddling" so obvious, so that it would take away the attention from your actual presentation.  I also give myself a "pep talk" before every oral presentation. And always be aware of your speech rate. Speak loudly, clearly, and try to annunciate.<br>  <br>  InshaAllah some of these tips work for you.<br>  <br>  May Allah SWT make things easier for you, and may you be successful in your oral presentations, Ameen.|`|g2CZi00Uaa	Picture the audience in their underwear, apparently it helps =P<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  Blow on your thumb, it is supposed to calm you down!<br>  Also, say bismillah before you go on stage<br>  <br>  good luck!
pTaKVH3Xaa	As an ftm who hasn't had any lower body modifications, I am upfront with any sexual/dating partner about being trans. I feel it is better to be honest up front that risk getting my butt kicked or developing a relationship that is later lost when they find out. I'm not sure how I'd handle it if I had fully functional male goods though. For now, I just deal with what I've got and make the best of it.|`|V5lxDoIRaa	My now fiance was told of my being transsexual about thirty seconds after he asked me out on a date.|`|upvd5TRRaa	good question.....just here observing =)<br>  <br>  at some point early on, they should definitely tell their partner about the fact that they had a sex change.  i mean, most people don't hide the fact that they were once married, have children, or whatever their past may hold, do they? transgendered people should not, under any circumstance, hide that fact from the person they love.  it's something that should be common knowledge amongst them & their partner.  i can't believe the answers i'm seeing!|`|aH0yYcTIaa	Whoa! Some people are touchy! She was just asking a question with the best intentions.|`|2ywzcoVqaa	I have been in this situation with a potential partner before. A girl I had been talking to online for awhile came out to me thinking I would reject her because she was mtf transgender. This was quite the opposite though & in fact we became best friends & soulmates. We ended up being together sexually and it was an enjoyable experience for both of us. She is still my sisterfriend & I appreciated that she came out to me before anything sexual happened. Had she not however,it would not have affected the outcome. I still would have respected her gender identity 100%. It's who a person IS that counts. Not who a person WAS.|`|65QqZBnjaa	My private medical history is just that PRIVATE.<br>  <br>  You see the underlying premise for questions like these is that we practice to deceive.  And it's just not so.  I am who I always should have been.  I was born with a female gender identity and as of a couple years ago I am whole in mind, body and spirit.  Finally whole!  You could have accused me of deception before transition, but not now.<br>  <br>  Further, asking me to disclose my private medical history is asking me to lie.  You want me to say "I used to be a man".  But I tell you I will NEVER speak those words because they are a LIE.  As I said I was born female.  That is my truth.  I had a birth condition and I fixed it.<br>  <br>  The problem is not me.  The problem is an ignorant society that refuses to become educated about transsexualism.<br>  <br>  <br>  Timmy: Maybe if you had to walk in our shoes and take the abuse we get you'd be singing a different tune.|`|SWYB8iQEaa	the thing about it is that we should get to the point where people would not "have" to tell because it would make no difference...<br>  <br>  ****edit: i'm afraid you misunderstood what I said. First of all, let me make clear that there is nothing wrong with you asking this question. It  is obvious that it is not  a "hostile" question.<br>  what i was trying to say by my answer is that the world should get to the point where we would be so over sexual discrimination and that  alternative sexualities such as homosexuals and transexuals would  not be something that would  seem odd or weird or a sin. Different sexual orientations should be well accepted and understood. That's why I said we should get to the point where we won't "have" to tell as if it is something we have to apologize for.|`|VRsu7c3Paa	My current girlfriend has known since the beginning that I'm FtM. I don't pass, and I'm not yet on hormones so usually I am mistaken for a lesbian. She's very understanding and was hesitant on touching me in certain ways which might be considered feminine. She now identifies as queer since it's more political than bisexual, and pansexuality just confuses most people.<br>  <br>  I guess the situation for transgender men is more complicated than it is for women since what is down below can't easily be fixed, so being out to a partner is usually a necessity. <br>  <br>  Umm let's see. This is kind of my first relationship where I've really truly been out as a guy. I'm probably going to transition really soon which will make us look like a heterosexual couple to everybody else. I know she'll stick with me through it all.

You can get in contact with other users through this site, but if you aren't careful this site will take up too much of your time and it will deplete your social skills.  That is one major disadvantage of the internet.  It is a time trap.  Many get sucked into the internet and they waste their lives away.  The internet can be a good tool for research and leisure but it can take away from your life.  I would suggest that if you feel addicted to yahoo or any other form of the internet, take a step back and immerse yourself in the real world.  Nothing beats talking to people face to face, or spending time with others aside form the internet.  Its better to have an actual life rather than waste it online.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Between the three cats, the puppy you found and Skippy, your husband working long hours, Sweetie your in need of human contact, and no, Yahoo does not provide that.

073ad2ba60d8cf71ef3514ad2f5a92eaaa	Something like this happened to me when I was in high school. I think my case was worse. The troublesome person was my best friend that I didnt know is friend with so many guys. In appearance she was better in hijab than me. So every body thought that I misled her and because I am very intelligent and naughty nobodu understood and that simple poor girl....... was misguided by me. I couldnt prove anything. She liked me and didnt want to put into trouble but she had a very strict, stoneheaded, uncivilized father that was afraid from him to death. So she didnt defend me. And what happened?<br>  I was the guilty one. My mother first defended me in the school but after some time that she saw every body testify that I am guilty she was in doubt who to believe.<br>  siiiiiiiiiiiigh I had a realy bad time because i didnt know what to do! So I did Tawakkol to Allah. I relied myself totally on Allah and he saved me from that terrible situation. Avoid talking and contacting her parents, but if possible try to know every thing they wanna do from the girl.<br>  And then Rely on ALLAH swt. May Allah helps you. Tomorrow is the anniversay of Prophet saw and the martyrdom of his grandson Hassan as. You can do Nazr for them. Hassan as is called Karim= generous of ahlulbeyt. Or if u dont like to do nazr for Hassan as you can swear Prophet to the love and respect of his grandson to help u.<br>  Or do not swear him just ask him to help u.<br>  At that time I did Nazr of once reading the whole Holy Quran and I got what I wanted.|`|n49i9t6paa	stuff like this happens all the time to me....just tell yourself as long as Allah, SWT, knows you truly didn't do anything wrong...why worry, its not worth the stress.<br>  <br>  anytime sis|`|Ca29B3eiaa	*sniff* wow! i know how you feel (kinda)<br>  the girl probably feels really bad about it all (maybe) i think its a good idea to just give this issue time to boil down. <br>  <br>  I see. <br>  May Allah help you :)|`|AORcLwTNaa	wow. this is why you shouldnt know girls|`|mOWyzwubaa	seems you are narrating your whole life !
AA10717341	Seventh-day Adventists are Christians, who believe that we are saved solely through Christ's sacrifice on the cross and our acceptance of His gift of salvation.  <br>  <br>  As Seventh-day Adventists, we want to follow in Christ's footsteps, and, we follow His example (Luke 4:16) and the apostles' example (Acts 17:2) in observing the seventh-day Sabbath as set apart by God at creation (Gen. 2:2 -- just like marriage between one man and one woman) and clarified in the Ten Commandments (Ex. 20:3-17, specifically 8-11 which also tell us not to worship false gods, not to tell lies, kill or steal).  <br>  <br>  Jesus also proclaimed that He was Lord of the Sabbath (Matt. 12:8, Mark 2:28, Luke 6:5 -- Why would Jesus proclaim that He was Lord of the Sabbath and then by mere implication -- rather than direct command change it Sunday?); and He taught on the Sabbath (Mark 1:21, Mark 6:2, Luke 4:31, Luke 6:6, Luke 13:10). It is also clear that Jesus expected his disciples to continue to observe the Sabbath, based upon His response to their inquiry regarding the end of the world: "And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath." (Matt. 24:20). <br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question.  God Bless!|`|FOzN3xwzaa	"Seventh Day adventist" is not Christian.

They have said in their Questions on Doctrine that the prophecies of Daniel 7 and Revelation 13 relate to the beast and the Papacy: "Thus it was that the Adventist heralds of Sabbath reform came to make a further logical application of the mark of the beast - holding it to be, in essence, the attempted change of the Sabbath of the 4th commandment of the Decalogue by the Papacy, its endeavor to impose this change on Christendom, and the acceptance of the Papacy's substitute by individuals." (p 181).<br>  <br>  Their doctrine of the Sabbath originated when a retired sea captain, Joseph Bates, became convinced that Saturday was the right day. Then he came into contact with a group of Adventists in New Hampshire who had been influenced by a lay woman, Mrs Rachel Oakes, to keep the Saturday Sabbath. Bates wrote two tracts, in which the position still held by the Adventists today was set forth. In 1847, Mrs. White of Adventist fame had a vision in which she received confirmation of this. On the basis of this guidance, Seventh-day Adventists overthrew the first-day Sunday, which had been observed by all the churches since the beginning of the Christian era.|`|u2BVwAKNaa	Why do they worship on the Sabbath???<br>  <br>  wierd|`|8TmK8Qklaa	it's the same as the Jewish people, Sat is figured out to be the real Sabbath as used in the bible but most people understand that the commandment is to rest one day a week not a specific day of the week.<br>  Sundays are traditional because businesses would close on those days so that all the people could gather together at a church and worship and fellowship etc.<br>  <br>  People shouldn't argue over what day-- that defeats the whole purpose.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	they want to but most know that we are under grace and God doesnt care which day we go....<br>  Col 2:16

They ate of the tree of knowledge of good and evil--this clearly infers that before consuming such fruit--they were non-sentient--that is--no concpet of right and wrong-good and evil. Given this to be the case--they could not have disobeyed your god because they didn't understand the concept of obey.  It was only after eating of the tree they understood.  Now--this makes your god look very tiny and capricious and hateful.  If you put a steak on the floor and say to your dog "don't eat this" and then walk out of the room--and your neighbor comes in and exhorts your dog to eat the steak--and the dog does----do you immediately take your dog out and dump it somewhere so it's on its own?  Only if you are a bit on the psychotic and carpricious side.  <br>       The problem is--as the hebrews were plagarizing myths from other cultures (the babylonian gods creating man from clay predate the bible) conceptually they just couldn't quite get it right--they have adam and eve portrayed as human beings who didn't know the difference between right and wrong--but must be punished for doing something they had no idea was wrong.  And afterwards--they knew they were naked--nudity is a cultural more that requires a civilization and in most cases women to isolate and protect from being touched by other men.  Aboriginal tribes --tribes similair to the dawn of man-have no such strictures against nudity.  Seeing they were naked being wrong then tells us that the author of this illogical story was interjecting his own cultural mores and not the mores you'd expect from aboriginal people.  this story is illogical and wrong in so many ways.|`|YH6Ja07eaa	The garden was  God's scientific experiment.

dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	To say that God's words have ceased with the end of the Book of Revelations in the Bible would also be saying that you do not believe that prayers are ever answered.   <br>  <br>  What is an answer to a prayer other than God's will and word being given to you.   God "REVEALS his responses to prayers.    God CONTINUES to share his will every day.<br>  <br>  It is closed minded and it confines the power of God to dictate to him that he is done speaking to us.

Do you really know, that the relevation is not the last written book?<br>  Moses said just the same in Deut 4: 2 ( <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/deut/4/2#2" rel="nofollow">http://scriptures.lds.org/deut/4/2#2</a> ). When it is to understand as you claim, what is with the rest of the bible?<br>  <br>  Noted Biblical scholar Bart Ehrman wrote:<br>  The very real danger that [New Testament] texts could be modified at will, by scribes who did not approve of their wording, is evident in other ways as well. We need always to remember that the copyists of the early Christian writings were reproducing their texts in a world in which there were not only no printing presses or publishing houses but also no such thing as copyright law. How could authors guarantee that their texts were not modified once put into circulation? The short answer is that they could not. That explains why authors would sometimes call curses down on any copyists who modified their texts without permission. We find this kind of imprecation already in one early Christian writing that made it into the New Testament, the book of Revelation, whose author, near the end of his text, utters a dire warning [quotes Revelation 22:18–19].<br>  <br>  This is not a threat that the reader has to accept or believe everything written in this book of prophecy, as it is sometimes interpreted; rather, it is a typical threat to copyists of the book, that they are not to add to or remove any of its words. Similar imprecations can be found scattered throughout the range of early Christian writings.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	i tested the burning in my bosom and it failed the test, I found it to not to be real, you cannot trust feelings, satan can tell you all day thatyou are depressed and you can tell satan that just because you feel that way, doe snto mean that you will feel that way all day, feelings can be deceptive and so can a burning in the bosom for the book of mormon. <br>  my arguement has always been that joseph smith added to deu. and revealtions in his footnotes, he added more then that in the community of christ church book of the JST KJV bible. The point is you just can;t come in and add footnotes to what the prophets wrote in the bible, if it is the word of God, then leav eit alone and if you have extra scriptures then fine, but leave the bible the way it was. To say that God is perfect now and then say that his bible is imperfect is a contridiction. <br>  prophecy is not for adding to scripture it is for encouragement adn edification.|`|WYk0zYdhaa	The biggest issue is the whole reason for this sermon is to promote the book of mormon as doctrine.  "As God's continued revelation."  <br>  <br>  Not being a mormon but having attended a mormon church and have been witnessed too many times, having the book of mormon on my bookshelf and even reading it myself, it doesn't have the credibility that the bible does.  The bible is recognized as cannon and done so by multiple witnesses and scholars as well as proof outside of the bible it's self that the people and places existed!  Archaeologists set out to disprove this or that have uncovered many things that correlate with the bible.  For instance there was a time when ppl doubted that the city of Ninevah ever existed.  Then one day someone found a brick with the ruler of that city's name on it.  They decided it was false until not too long after an archaeologist uncovered the entire city!!!  This has happened on multiple occasions.  There are many external sources as well that attest that  the people and places of the bible are true.  <br>  There is no such evidence for the book of mormon.  Call the Smithsonian in Washington DC and ask for something to support this book and they have nothing.  <br>  <br>  God preserves His word and in ancient manuscripts such as the Dead Sea Scrolls and even earlier works the content is VERY close to what we have in today's bible.  A few grammerical errors.. the scribes who copied the bible by hand were so careful that if one mistake was made he had to start all over again.  There are many independently verifiable accounts pertaining to the bible (and not all of followers) that were still living in a generation of some of the apostles who knew Jesus first hand).  IF there had been falicies at that time don't you think they would have loved to call that?  <br>   No one that I know of (ppl are welcome to email me if they have them) has any proof that the mormon book is true or to be taken as continued revelation from God.  I obviously don't know everyone and everything lol and that is why I welcome any proof.<br>  <br>  I in no way am saying that God has stopped revealing things to us.  He does each and every day!  As we grow in Him we learn.. each time I open my bible I see something in a new way... a passage that makes more sense now having learned more of the context and history behind it:)  God is very much involved with us when we pray as well of course.|`|8jhACvtlaa	I bet I can guess which one it is, but alas, YouTube is on the firewall's custom block list....

Uh... you are so uneducated about Mormons that it's unbelievable... <br>  <br>  1) Big Love is an HBO show that is not based on reality, nor is it a good source to learn about Mormonism.  <br>  <br>  2) Mormons are not Quakers.  We watch TV all the time.  We have computers.  We use technology.  In fact... the TV was INVENTED by a Mormon!  We have our own TV channel (BYUTV).  And to top it off... BYUTV is broadcast from Utah... so yeah, Mormons not only are allowed to watch TV, but they do watch TV, rather avidly.  The only limits they put on is they don't watch programs that go against our standards (ie, they wouldn't watch Porn, they would probably not watch Big Love because of how stupid it is, etc.)<br>  <br>  3) We LOVE the bible.  We READ the bible.  We STUDY the bible.  Imagine my surprise when, as a child, I went to a Bible camp with a friend (a day camp sort of thing) and there was a competition of bible knowledge and I was put in the advanced area because I kept beating everyone in my age group.  My level of studying the bible in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and reading it exceeded that of my friends and several other Christian religions that we were mixing with.  We do not discredit, discount, or ignore the Bible.  We do not hold the Book of Mormon as better, higher, or as a replacement for the Bible.  <br>  <br>  Please, please PLEASE learn more about the Mormon church at least enough to not look like a fool when you talk about them.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	Good video.

It's hilarious and very touching, about how mothers do everything for us, and all we do is give them stuff we make at summer day camp.<br>  <br>  It's a beautiful poem, but I would only suggest it if you and your mother like non-corny poetry.<br>  <br>  You can find the poem here:  <a href="http://www.billy-collins.com/2005/06/the_lanyard.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.billy-collins.com/2005/06/the...</a> .  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|XY5oSFGNaa	you could say something like <br>  <br>  No matter how old you get,<br>  No matter how sick you get,<br>  No matter how sad you get,<br>  No matter how weak you get <br>  i will always be there for you<br>  as long as i shall ever live Mom !|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Maybe you can use her first name  ex Mary & take each letter & put a word next to it like M-Mom  A-always there  R-right!

She called me crying, had me crying to.  She says she reads that letter all the time.<br>  <br>  A mother is the truest friend we have, when trials, heavy and sudden, fall upon us; when adversity takes the place of prosperity; when friends who rejoice with us in our sunshine, desert us when troubles thicken around us, still will she cling to us, and endeavor by her kind precepts and counsels to dissipate the clouds of darkness, and cause peace to return to our hearts.<br>  <br>  A mother is a person who seeing there are only four pieces of pie for five people, promptly announces she never did care for pie.<br>  <br>  Most of all the other beautiful things in life come by twos and threes by dozens and hundreds. Plenty of roses, stars, sunsets, rainbows, brothers, and sisters, aunts and cousins, but only one mother in the whole world.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Leave out the "Half century old" part - ha ha she won't appreciate that so much.!<br>  Say happy birthday!|`|UTZC8dlHaa	If you have a picture of you and your Mom, send that along in the card and write a little about, do you remember when we did this or that?

hceNM6Uxaa	Oh, that's not the half of it!  It IS a wicked evil demon, not merely possessed by one.  If one punctuates correctly, it will accuse you of mis-spelling and/or too much punctuation (try offering it "one's" - it really doesn't like that at all).  It also can't handle British spelling.  But it's the inability to understand accurate punctuation that really aggravates me.<br>  <br>  This seems to be a failure of all these systems.  They are only as good as the person who devised them.  Bill Gates' lunacies in the grammar checker in Word are just laughable - I have it permanently turned off since it perpetually wants to correct absolutely perfect grammar.<br>  <br>  The faux-matey nonsense of the Y!A spell check ("Oops! It looks like you have 3 misspellings" etc) makes me want to hurl things at the screen.  All one can do is ignore it.

N7JPzxiRaa	We see the mother grow increasingly frail-looking and tired, though at the last minute she will be spared from the birds to join her son and his wife-to-be as together they flee the devastation all around them - which includes the death of a family friend named Annie - to a better life far away.  The narrator, alerted by Olga, his future wife, finally sees that he must face up to what the birds mean to him personally, that is, he must learn to be his authentic self: a scene on Hampstead Heath in which he outfaces his 'Demon' bird (pp. 169-70) is the equivalent of Melanie's climactic ordeal in the attic in Hitchcock's film.  He writes: 'I stood up.  My ankles ached, my limbs were bruised, blood was dripping from my chin. ...
vanUYJjjaa	You're asking the wrong question. You should ask:<br>  <br>  "How long has it been trendy to be from a culture in American that celebrates, creates, thrives, lives and loves even though the dominate culture steals from us, hates on us and secretly envies us?"<br>  <br>  Since the beginning of time. We're the only group that has created music in this country that has birthed other genres.

This man didnt ask the question right, but I know what he is getting at. <br>  <br>  Example 1... Go to a school. Any  school. If you get a white boy, and he is nerdy, wears glasses, is a tub of lard, he will be picked on and have no friends. Take the same boy, but he's white, he'll still be in the in crowd, just because he is black. <br>  <br>  Example 2... When people walk nerdy, you say, "Oh man, that guy is so WHITE trash!" If you say that, but substitute white with black, you're racist. Great world we have huh?<br>  <br>  Example 3... In my high school there were always white people who were like "I'm half black, you just cant tell because my mom was white" Its a load of BS, they just want to be 'cool'. <br>  <br>  Example 4.... Look at what teens these days are wearing? Hoodies, du rags, sagging pants, etc etc. This all was spawned by black people. They arent doing it to be trendy, they are doing it to appear black. <br>  <br>  You look around and tell me that it isnt trendy to be black.|`|89be3656aab8efef76257e64df83b534aa	another way of cementing the lie of 'blackness' by people who are skin deep

zBqt99avaa	There are a couple of possibilities here.<br>  <br>  You have to keep in mind that not everyone speaks English as a first language.  Someones question might not make perfect sense, because they are trying to ask a complex question with limited vocabulary.  And Y!A's spell checker isn't the greatest.  So there's one point.<br>  <br>  Next up, some people really have limited knowledge.  For example, despite several years exposure to Islam, I only found out Muslims had any belief of Jesus about 1 or 2 years ago.  So someone could be asking a "ridiculous" question with sincerity.<br>  <br>  Finally, while someone may ask a trolling question on purpose to cause trouble of some kind, you don't know who is reading the questions but not responding.  There are plenty of non-Muslims who come here and read but don't post answers.  So in this case, if you have a good answer, you should respond.  That way the "truth" as you see it gets exposure, not just the trolls' statements.<br>  <br>  However, in some cases, it's much better to ignore certain individuals.  If they just spew hatred with no logical argument, what's the point?  Anyone of any background can see it's just hate speech, and won't think it's the truth.  Giving attention to such people only encourages them.<br>  <br>  So if you can clear up a misconception, I would encourage you to do so; if it's just hate, best to leave them be IMO.

uVQ6OSu3aa	We call them "clowns," but Pueblos think of them as sacred personages. They are called "Koshares," "Kurenas," "Mudheads" and "Koyemshi."  There are other names as well.  Who are these beings? Are they all alike?  What is their role at the various Pueblos? What do the old Pueblo stories say about  the Sacred Clowns? Why are they black and white & what's on their head? How does someone get to be a Koshare?  When do they make their appearances?  How are they mentioned in Pueblo origin stories? <br>  The challege with this topic is to understand why these clowns are considered sacred.

The book actually has nothing to do with the Maccabees or their revolt against the Greek empire, as described in 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees. Instead it tells the story of persecution of the Jews under Ptolemy IV Philopator (222-205 BC). The name of the book apparently comes from the similarities between this book and the stories of the martyrdom of Eleazar and the Maccabeean youths in 2 Maccabees; the High Priest Shimon is also mentioned|`|wxBFZ41Taa	Here is what I found on this.

The Orthodox have added to it, Protestants have subtracted from it. <br>  <br>  Pope Damasus and the Council of Rome (AD 382)<br>  <br>  Quote:<br>  Now indeed we must treat of the divine Scriptures, what the universal Catholic Church accepts and what she ought to shun. <br>  The order of the Old Testament books begins here: <br>  <br>  Genesis, one book<br>  Exodus, one book<br>  Leviticus, one book<br>  Numbers, one book<br>  Deuteronomy, one book<br>  Joshua Nave, one book<br>  Judges, one book<br>  Ruth, one book<br>  Kings, four books [= 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings]<br>  Paralipomenon, two books [= 1 & 2 Chronicles]<br>  Psalms, one book<br>  <br>  Solomon, three books:<br>  <br>  Proverbs, one book<br>  Ecclesiastes, one book<br>  Canticle of Canticles, one book<br>  <br>  Likewise:<br>  <br>  Wisdom, one book [= Wisdom of Solomon]<br>  Ecclesiasticus, one book [= Sirach]<br>  <br>  Likewise the order of the Prophets: <br>  <br>  Isaiah, one book<br>  Jeremiah, one book [includes Baruch] <br>  with Ginoth, that is, with his Lamentations<br>  Ezekiel, one book<br>  Daniel, one book<br>  Hosea, one book<br>  Micah, one book<br>  Joel, one book<br>  Obadiah, one book<br>  Jonah, one book<br>  Nahum, one book<br>  Habakkuk, one book<br>  Zephaniah, one book<br>  Haggai, one book<br>  Zechariah, one book<br>  Malachi, one book<br>  <br>  LIkewise the order of the histories: <br>  <br>  Job, one book<br>  Tobias, one book [= Tobit]<br>  Esdras, two books [= Ezra & Nehemiah]<br>  Esther, one book<br>  Judith, one book<br>  Maccabees, two books<br>  <br>  Likewise the order of the writings of the New and eternal Testament, which the holy and Catholic Church supports. <br>  Of the gospels: <br>  <br>  according to Matthew, one book<br>  according to Mark, one book<br>  according to Luke, one book<br>  according to John, one book.<br>  <br>  The Epistles of Paul, in number fourteen: <br>  <br>  to the Romans, one<br>  to the Corinthians, two<br>  to the Ephesians, one<br>  to the Thessalonians, two<br>  to the Galatians, one<br>  to the Philippians, one<br>  to the Colossians, one<br>  to Timothy, two<br>  to Titus, one<br>  to Philemon, one<br>  to the Hebrews, one<br>  <br>  Likewise:<br>  <br>  the Apocalypse of John, one book.<br>  and the Acts of the Apostles, one book.<br>  <br>  Likewise the canonical epistles, in number seven: <br>  <br>  of Peter the Apostle, two epistles<br>  of James the Apostle, one epistle<br>  of John the Apostle, one epistle<br>  of another John, the presbyter, two epistles<br>  of Jude the Zealot, the Apostle, one epistle.<br>  <br>  The canon of the New Testament ends here.<br>  <br>  [Source: Denzinger, The Sources of Catholic Dogma, Thirtieth Edition, Sect. 84, pages 33-34]<br>  <br>  The Vulgate (published A.D. 405) contains the canon of the Council of Rome.

It originally meant only "hidden" -- but Protestants used it in a slanderous way therefore the cultural meaning of aprocrypha changed to mean "suspicious, false, spurious,  cult-like, etc." <br>  <br>  So neither Roman Catholics nor Orthodox Catholics call them that unless they are trying to use a term that Protestants can understand. <br>  <br>  So right off the bat.. you might have dug up old wounds by using that term. <br>  <br>  If you are addressing a specific group, better to use a term that THEY use, then a term you use to describe the same thing. <br>  <br>  The proper term when discussing them with Catholics is "deuterocanonicals"<br>  <br>  We'd probably need a person of the Orthodox faith to tell us.<br>  I am Roman Catholic, so I'm not exactly sure. <br>  <br>  I know that the Orthodox church recognizes the authority of the Catholic church BUT still retains autonomy to make their own decisions.  So it COULD be that they used different criteria which allows them to include some extra books. <br>  <br>  ALSO,  SOME of the books which differ, are actually included in the RCC bible, but using a different naming or numbering scheme.  I think all the Macabee books are included but the RCC numbers them 1 &2, while the Orthodox church breaks them out into 1-4.  So different numbering but same content. <br>  <br>  This shouldn't be a problem for Protestants, since they came to the game much later  AND believe in Personal Interpretation - so since they believe that everyone should read scripture and that the Holy Spirit will guide the person to get the correct meaning from scripture and there is no "central" authority here on earth to tell us WHAT to believe,  THEN Protestants shouldn't have an issue with Catholics believing in (from their prespective) additional books  IF the holy spirit still guides them AND there is no central authority to say what IS or ISN'T scriptural?

H3JK4Zp2aa	According to folklore, twin flames are complete individual souls, perhaps the yin and the yang, that began as one soul before separating and evolving independently throughout lifetimes,  so they are the "ancient" halves of a single soul that split.<br>  <br>  You might make an analogy of identical twin embryos.  <br>  <br>  <br>   "the word twin means identical, similar, or of the same embryo which has divided into two, thereby forming a replica, a twin. Also contained in each twin is an extra sensory perception, a sixth sense. This has allowed each twin to penetrate the web of the ether's to sense the other, to know when the other twin is in danger, or ill. You can all accept and understand this, it has been documented, so has been accepted through experience and the written communication.'<br>  <br>  A twin flame can be anyone of the above, yet there is an unbroken spiritual connection<br>  <br>  <br>  I have a friend who I feel is my twin.  We are alike and we understand each other yet so far our timing has been off.  For example, I might be feeling similar to her, only a week or two later, yet there is a 6th sense between us, I am sure. .  Haven't known her too long but I see her as a friend.  A part of my purpose, I feel is to help carry her towards completion of her identity.  I wouldn't say this is a situation where I am her lover; more like a spirit guide.<br>  <br>  It's strange how similar we are.  Right now she is more like I have been just a few years ago and I feel like I am like her just a few years ago too.  I think that we met too soon.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, "individual people are not quite ready for the intensity."  If you are not prepared to to meet physically, it can be overwhelming, but   it seems impossible to destroy the connection.  I would say that a twin flame is more spiritual than sexual, but it can be both if both reach the degree of personal evolution that is needed.  For me at this moment, it is a friend who I serve a purpose for but time will tell if this friendship grows into greater friendship.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, I suppose a twin can be either, both or neither.|`|lOXqBBOwaa	Twin flames are soul-mates. For example, 2 peas in a pod or peanut butter and jelly. When I met my soul-mate, I knew in my heart and stomach that he was the one. I felt so complete and full; It was like I knew him forever and we would never leave each other no matter what. A soul-mate can be a friend and lover btw. :)|`|hTlzSCYlaa	"And when one of them meets with his other half, the actual half of himself, the pair are lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy and one will not be out of the other's sight even for a moment."<br>  Plato<br>  2,500 years ago...|`|aZXnW6AUaa	both|`|6W61fS5paa	You mean twin soul?

8PWXSZRHaa	I think Cookie answered for most of us women: Fear of Rejection. That fear is a powerful thing. <br>  <br>  I also think a lot of it has to do with society and what we are told growing up.

I spend 6 months every year of the past 15 years in India. Needless to say I love it. Its culture, colour diversity make it a fascinating country. The system although appearing unfair ( rich v poor) is sometimes hard to fathom but the poor have a smile for you and will share their last crust with you, which is more than I can say or the British who seem to think consumerism is compulsary. Of course there  is dirt and squalid places but also beauty in nature and heritage. I do find it difficult to explain to people in the Uk what its all about but would say to anyone, put preconceptions aside and go see for yourself.<br>  Its system of transport far outways the UK system. Its cheap to travel and although sometimes hot and dusty the trains are an adventure and have to be experienced. Its a vast country and each state different from each other so you get the feeling you are in another country, not just 500km down  the track. No need to say I am a fan of India and hope to continue my lifestyle for years to come. I am 65 and it makes no difference here I am recognised as a person and not an invisible being as in the UK. The older you are the more respect you get, so your previous experiences of life are counted as as asset.<br>  Anyway go for it!

Then you start hating it when you get mobbed outside the airport by cab drivers. Then you start loving it because the cab drive is really cheap. Then you hate it because you see some idiot trying to hit his wife or kids. Then you love it because you see the wife and kids still loving their husbands or father. Then you hate the smell on the road. Then you love the smell of the food. Then you hate spice in the food. But then you love the waiter for being so polite. Then you hate to see poor people on the road. Then you love to see that they have so much life and spirit in them. Then you hate the traffic.

XJ9oSR2daa	I took a few from my singles ministry to this, there were 3 total of us.  One was divorced, in the last 2 yrs and he suffered the whole way through this film.  I have been divorced for 14 yrs now and I thought it was a great movie myself.  My other person has never been married and is older in life and she cried lol. <br>  <br>  A church in my town is doing a love dare study but including singles, so we have plugged into that also.  I will keep you updated, not sure how they are doing it.<br>  <br>  I just know that Jesus has to be my all in all, and even tho there isn't a man in my life that can fulfill the position that KirK Cameron has in the movie, Jesus takes care of everything in my life and in that is great peace.  Hopefully someday He might bring a great man into my life and I would definately go through the marriage study with him, but if not, I would rather have comfort in knowing that I am right where I need to be, in the center of Gods will, no matter the outcome.|`|pRF5LLloaa	While it was never intended as a movie "for" Christian singles, there are many lessons to be learned.<br>  <br>  Most singles, even Christians, today don't realize what WORK a marriage really is.  It take committment and devotion, even more so than love.  Love will fade in and out as time goes on, but through devotion and committment, it ALWAYS returns.<br>  <br>  But singles today often think that when "love" goes out of a marriage, then the marriage is over.  They get pissed off, and you ehar that selfish war-cry: "You don't loVe me any more!"  and they don't want to WORK at it any more.  The divorce rate is just as high in Christian marriages as in secular marriages.<br>  <br>  So "Fireproof" shops the single person that marriage needs WORK and committment.  Love is the GOAL, not the glue.  <br>  <br>  I don't remember it coming up in the movie, But I always think of Ecclesiastes 4:9-12<br>  "Two are better than one, <br>  ...because they have a good return for their work: <br>  If one falls down, <br>  ...his friend can help him up. <br>  ...But pity the man who falls <br>  ...and has no one to help him up! <br>  Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. <br>  ...But how can one keep warm alone? <br>  Though one may be overpowered, <br>  ...two can defend themselves. <br>  ...A cord of three strands is not quickly broken."<br>  <br>  At least, it sound like YOU know what that "Third Cord" is . . . . . .|`|1pFcDyeDaa	I loved the movie too.  And I think it was a good message to both married and singles because it shows how NOT to treat each other.

This movie should serve as an example of how a godly marriage should be.  The Bible says for "husbands to love their wife as Christ loved the church."  ......selfLESSLY and wives are to respect their husbands.  If husbands will loves their wives like Christ commands...the wife will AUTOMATICALLY love her husband....wow.....it will all come naturally.  We want to be cherished and loved and our love will come flowing back to you.    Also put CHRIST FIRST IN YOUR MARRIAGE...PRAY TOGETHER.....<br>  <br>  Let this movie be a good example of what TO DO and what NOT TO DO...whether you're single or married.|`|AA11686091	That there is Hope for a Christian Marriage.

The main theme I got from the movie was the fact that no matter how bad the marriage may be, and no matter what is going on, we should never leave our partner.  The main theme is to stick it out when marriage gets rocky.  So many couples quit in their marriages not realizing that Christ should be the foundation of that marriage.  That was the other aspect I found interesting.  Before Christ became the center Kirk's character along with his wife were not able to fully love each other.  But God teaches us how to love.  Without him we cannot listen, we cannot fully understand, and we cannot fully love.  I thought that was the other message overall.  It was a great movie and I would recommend it for anyone.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	For a single person it should show you that love does not stop with the "I do."  You must maintain your marriage with the Bible and remain open to your spouse.  Flee every aspect of evil or Satan will gain a foot hold and wreck your marriage, with your help.  I believe Dr. Dobson said "Go into marriage with your eyes wide open and half shut there after."  Take plenty of time finding the right person.|`|c5a50631f90f4ba04d88c923dc2aa963aa	haven't seen but but heard good things... as a single i guess i would want to see that it's ok to be single and that there is room in the kingdom on this side of eternity for us too|`|0ac02757252bf3673e5594f1927600faaa	aren't many singles preparing to be married?  they could see what they should be aiming for in behavior|`|TzY9vkinaa	There was that part where he found out his mom wrote the dare and he apologized.

I don't regret having him, but who I had him by.  But I know if it hadn't of been him that my son would not be who he is...but still, I can't stand his father or his sorry family.  His dad is a 30 year old alcoholic titty baby that lives at home with his parents.  His parents are both on disability, but it's not really legit..they are serious pill heads and visit quack doctors and decided to get really fat, and I mean like 350lbs or more each..so of course they are gonna have serious problems.  I can't stand any of them and they have been nothing but trouble for me for the 13 years my son has been alive!

UGH!<br>  <br>  Add:ok, well if I could go back in time and do it differently..but only with the knowledge that I have now.  I would have met him, got pregnant, then run off and never even let him know I had a child by him.  He never would have asked.  I never would have seen him or his horrible family again and my son wouldn't be subjected to their bad influences.

This is the reason why I could not understand two recent court verdicts handed out on the same day. <br>  <br>  In the first ruling, two thieves who stole two rams were sentenced to three years imprisonment and 1,000 lashes each. <br>  <br>  The second ruling of two years imprisonment and 200 whiplashes was for a husband who beat his wife until she swallowed her tongue and died.<br>  <br>  I could not find any explanation for the great difference in the two rulings although they were reached under the same law. Are the two rams more valuable than the woman or is the life of a human being cheaper than that of livestock?<br>  <br>  I am not evaluating the judicial system or delving into the parameters of the rulings. I’m just trying to understand how some judges think and issue their verdicts? It might be true that the woman was killed unintentionally and the rams were stolen with intent, but this will not answer the questions that arise from the two verdicts.<br>  <br>  I doubt very much the Ministry of Justice will include the two verdicts in its records because they contradict the picture that the ministry is trying to draw that court verdicts are based on principles of fairness and not the personal views of judges.<br>  <br>  I know that the judiciary has a spirit that is not separated from the recorded text and which judges cannot do without while carrying out their duties. However, some amazing rulings make us doubtful of this spirit.<br>  <br>  In the West, we often hear about contradicting rulings in almost identical cases. However, these contradictions should not exist here as our justice is based on Shariah, not personal assessment or whims even if the case was of two rams whose destiny we do not know.|`|gplfqOEHaa	If u ask me, books r just books and I have read enough to say this and I am a Muslim.<br>  <br>  Facts and tested facts only should answer your question.<br>  <br>  How can dreams show future even to the minute details?<br>  <br>  How dreams work, a small read. <a href="Http://nxrb.blogspot.com/2009/2/am-i-a-lesbian_17.html" rel="nofollow">Http://nxrb.blogspot.com/2009/2/am-i-a-l...</a>|`|cl4wdRnvaa	Neither.

The Quran is the best example of Arabic poetry,some argue that it is one of the best,whatever.So as far as eloquence and content,it is unparralled.There are layers and layers of meaning to the recitation,some of which we only are recently coming to understand. It is obvious that you know nothing about Islam so before you open your mouth to criticise make sure that you can can provide proof to your claims,and the knowledge to stand behind them.|`|3GO5k5nNaa	Hi Heoric dose, <br>  <br>  I would say the Quran does for the following reason.<br>  <br>  The Quran covers address many different types of people<br>  - Muslims<br>  - People of the Book (Jews and Christians)<br>  - Atheists<br>  - Polythesist<br>  - Materials <br>  - etc<br>  <br>  It also covers many topics very comprehensively<br>  - Economics<br>  - Sociology<br>  - Politcs<br>  - Spirituality<br>  <br>  - in fact it touches on every endavour of human interaction.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hi heroic dose, I thought you were asking a question to get some benefit...Please show me your claims regarding peodophilia....|`|rFUUmZgwaa	too many lies in the books you mention.|`|7Bj4AAo8aa	The Quran does!<br>  <br>  Also see:<br>  Earth is geo-spherical (different eggs vary in roundness):<br>  "He made the earth egg-shaped."

TMb076n6aa	No to some it is just a sacrement. Alot of Catholic Charasmatics beleive that it is literal. To me it is symbolic.|`|yB0nVXfWaa	No, I don't believe in the real and literal presence of Christ in Communion - ie. in the bread or wafer.  That's what you mean, isn't it?<br>  <br>  'This' I do 'in remembrance' of him (for his once-for-all sacrifice on the cross needs to be remembered) - nothing more.  <br>  <br>  This is the common position of all Protestants and has been right from the beginning, though the Lutherans had a few problems.  This very thing, that the eucharist is actually a memorial and you are not actually eating the real body and drinking the real blood of Christ in an 'unbloody sacrifice' every time you do it, is at the heart of Protestantism, just as 'the mass' and transubstantiation is at the heart of Catholicism.<br>  <br>  In other words, if you believe in this, you might just as well 'go the whole hog' because, to all intents and purposes, you ARE Catholic.<br>  <br>  Let me explain further.  When they were burning the early Protestants at the stake, it was this matter, above all others, that qualified them for the flames.  It was not whether they submitted to the Pope, not whether the Catholic Church was the one and only true one, not even whether the Scriptures should take precedent over Tradition.  Nothing, absolutely nothing, outweighed this one thing, and it was this insistence of Protestants that Jesus was NOT bodily present in the Mass that did it.  This was what they died for, this was what condemned them, for they were denying the very heart of Catholicism.<br>  <br>  Now do you see - this is what Catholicism is?<br>  <br>  Not only that, it doesn't stop there.  Just think about it - what does a Catholic priest, and all the people, do when they walk down the aisle, or stand up to behold the 'host' in the 'monstrance'?  The priests prostrate themselves, and the people worship.  Why not? - if it is truly the bodily presence of Christ there?<br>  <br>  Now, ask yourself, are you prepared to do likewise? - to worship a wafer, and to kneel for hours 'adoring the host', until you see visions of strange things?<br>  <br>  Is this not idolatry? For, if you believe that Jesus is there in bodily form in the 'host' then it makes sense to worship it, but if not, then it is idolatry.  I say this not in condemnation, but so you will see what this belief of yours means and where it leads to.<br>  <br>  Actually, there's a lot of people in the Emerging Church believing this now.  What the leaders know, and the people don't, is that they're all 'marching back to Rome'.  This 'second Reformation' they so proclaim is undoing everything the first Reformation ever did.|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	Different denominations, different views.<br>  Lutheran view is that Christ is around the wine & bread, but not in it as Roman Catholics do.<br>  Presbyterians view is that Christ is present in the room but is not somehow a part of the bread & wine.<br>  Baptist view is that it is just a memorial.|`|3WYcPsm4aa	Yes....

e21a15c26fe150cd05b8f03735e6ce4caa	Adult, believers-only baptism would be a demonstration of faith in Christ, and yes, practicing your faith.  But what does it do to gain anything except give the believer a nice experience, and maybe make Jesus happy?  It does not earn Heaven, there is no salvation in it. So why do it?  It's a commandment to do so by Jesus in the Great Commission.<br>  <br>  That makes it tradition.  Do it 'cause your s'posed to. It's a shout-out, to the world, of your own beliefs, one time.

It can't hurt and it may help.|`|e834d8db36b13de567ab48eb9cdaf267aa	Baptism is the point when a repentant believer becomes a Christian (saved). Baptism is how God has appointed for us to receive the gift of salvation.<br>  <br>  1 Peter 3:21 says, “…baptism now saves you -- not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience – through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.” (NASB)<br>  <br>  Baptism is a command of Christ. He said, “He that believes and is baptized shall be saved.” (Mark 16:16)<br>  <br>  Many will tell you that someone believes, is saved, and then he shall be baptized. This is not the same thing Jesus said. It is not in the same order.<br>  <br>  What would Jesus have said if he had meant, “He that believes and is baptized shall be saved”?<br>  <br>  I believe he said what he meant and meant what he said. I believe Jesus! “He that believes not shall be condemned.” (Mark 16:16)<br>  <br>  Many agree that baptism is commanded by Christ, but they say it is not necessary for salvation. However, Hebrews 5:9 says, “He became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.”<br>  <br>  According to these verses, in order to be saved it is necessary to obey Christ, therefore it is necessary to be baptized since Christ commanded it.<br>  <br>  Acts 2:38 says that baptism is “for the remission of sins”, “unto the remission of sins” or “so that your sins will be forgiven”. (Depending on which translation you read.) <br>  <br>  In the conversion of Saul (Paul), Acts 22:16 says he was commanded to be baptized and wash away his sins. Can we be saved if our sins remain? The blood of Christ washes away sins (Revelation 1:5) .<br>  <br>  Romans 6:3-4 says we are “baptized into Christ”. Can we be saved outside of Christ? (See Gal. 3:27 also.) These verses in Romans also say we are “baptized into his death”. At Christ’s death is where his saving blood was shed and offered for our sins. We must contact His death to contact that blood! Can we be saved if we have not contacted His death?<br>  <br>  How can our sins be washed away by the blood (Revelation 1:5) if we have not contacted that blood? To contact the blood, we must contact His death where the blood was shed!<br>  <br>  Romans 6:3-13 also say that at baptism we “rise to walk in newness of life.” At a birth there is a new life. Can we be saved if we have not been “born again” to this new life in Christ?<br>  <br>  In the New Testament after Jesus gave the command about baptism, every example of a conversion specifically mentions baptism. None of these converts ate, drank, slept, or continued their journey until they were baptized. It was always immediate.<br>  <br>  Some point to examples, such as the thief on the cross, before Jesus issued his command of baptism. He could not have obeyed a command that had not yet been issued. Also the death, burial, and resurrection that baptism now represents had not occurred at that time. How could he be baptized into Christ's death, when Christ had not yet died? How could he have been “buried with Christ” (Col. 2:12) when Christ had not yet been buried? How could he rise from baptism “in the likeness of His resurrection” when Christ had not yet risen?<br>  <br>  Those before Christ's death lived under the Old Testament. The New Testament came into effect after Christ died and rose again. (Hebrews 9:15-17) And remember, it was after His death that Jesus commanded baptism (Mark 16:16, Matt. 28:18-20) All those who now live after that point in time are subject to the New Testament and to that command.<br>  <br>  Also, the thief on the cross was at the scene of Christ's crucifixion. He had direct contact with Christ at His death. We are not in that position. Again, it is through baptism that we contact His death!<br>  <br>  Saul who I mentioned earlier, is a good example of the necessity of baptism. He spoke to Jesus. He called Jesus “Lord” and he asked what he needed to do to be saved. Jesus told him to go into the city and it would be told to him what he “must do”. In the city he fasted for three days and he was praying. (Acts 9:9-11) Many would say he was saved at that point, but he still had not been told what he “must do”.<br>  <br>  Then he was told to be baptized and wash away his sins “calling on the name of the Lord”. Obviously, “calling on the name of the Lord” involved more that saying ‘Lord’, more than praying, more than belief and more than repentance. Saul had done all of these things, but he still needed to call on the name of the Lord!<br>  <br>  The phrase “calling on the name of the Lord” means to rely on His authority. Saul had not done this until he did what the Lord authorized (instructed), namely “be baptized”. (Mark 16:16, Matthew 28:18-20, read Luke 24:47 along with Acts 2:5 & 38).<br>  <br>  Please note, even though he had not eaten or drank for three days, he was baptized before he took food. (Acts 9:18-19) This shows the urgency of baptism. In fact, none of the new converts in the book of Acts ate, drank, or slept until they had been baptized!

Such conduct by those of this world often causes much surprise to the peaceful servants of the only light. They find it hard to understand until they call to mind what Jesus said concerning such experiences: “Happy are ye, whensoever they may reproach you and persecute you and say every evil thing against you falsely for my sake: rejoice and exult, because your reward is great in the heavens; for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you.”—Matt. 5:11, Roth.|`|qCY7pvj1aa	Not all of them.

In the year 33 of our Common Era, Nisan 14 started at sundown on April?1<br>  <br>  we celebrate it once a year on the 14th day of Nisan, Nisan being the first month of the calendar for Jehovah’s covenant people according to his decree >>at Exodus 12:1-6. This was passover day, for immediately after observing the Jewish passover as a Jew “under law” Jesus introduced the Memorial to his eleven faithful apostles<br>  <br>  By God’s decree, passover was celebrated once a year, on the day that was the anniversary of the first passover held by the Jews in Egypt just before they marched out of that “house of bondage”. On that passover day Jesus died on the torture stake at Calvary, not alone as the great passover, the “Lamb of God”, but also as the Heir of God’s kingdom which will vindicate God’s sovereignty over all creation. So, to “keep proclaiming the death of the Lord, until he arrives”, we properly celebrate it only on its anniversary date, Nisan 14.<br>  <br>  At what time of day should it be observed? After sundown, or after 6?p.m. Standard Time, for among Jehovah’s ancient covenant-people each new day began at that time and it extended through midnight and the following daylight period until sundown. Hence Memorial must be observed on the night of Nisan 14. Paul says it was “in the night in which he was going to be handed over” that Jesus took the Memorial emblems and handed them out to his apostles. (1?Cor. 11:23, NW) The very name, the Lord’s supper or “the Lord’s evening meal”,|`|0gDqh8JNaa	the 9th of April we have our memorial of Jesus Christ Death and that normally takes place after sundown.... each congregation's times might vary slightly so if you know any JW's they will be able to give you the details... if not then you can go to your local Kingdom and iam sure you can get the information there....<br>  <br>  iam not sure what country you are from but last weekend in Ireland there was an assembly...where we get together and enjoy bible talks presented to us.... other then that then there wasn't any event that i know of going on!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!<br>  <br>  if you have any questions then here are the offical websites...<br>  <br>  www.jw.org<br>  www.watchtower.org <br>  www.jw-media.org|`|4bqm1zTCaa	<a href="http://www.4witness.org/jehovahs_witness/jw_lds_cults.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.4witness.org/jehovahs_witness...</a>|`|Dl1J1Y9Haa	The memorial of Jesus death is coming up soon|`|PSk0zY5uaa	theres going to be a worldwide campaign in a couple months, and we'll be giving out the invitation the the memorial of Christ's death.

It is my right to judge whether or not what someone tells me is accurate or not. I know enough people of other religions to see that not all people are the same in any religion. I grew up as a Christian, but questioned my beliefs when I reached adulthood. I tried to believe in something else, but none of it rung true. Christianity is like no other religion, because it is about love and forgiveness, not rules and punishment. That is not to say that there are no rules and no punishment, but it is not what Christianity focuses on, no matter what some would make of it. Christianity is the only religion that really offers salvation, and it is for that reason that I came back to it. It's the best decision I have ever made, and I have grown much since then, but there is still much growing left to do. I do understand other religions and where they are coming from though. Some religions I see as potentially harmful, but I don't fault those who follow that religion. They often grew up being taught that, just as I did, but unlike me, they never had a reason to research other faiths and try them. If they are content in their religion I won't bother them. Christianity, after all, is about salvation for everyone. In the end, all will have to go through Jesus to reach God, because none can go to the Father except through the Son. But I don't think that all hope is lost for those who can't or won't accept it now.|`|52246014c6731089215da64339f2d610aa	Relijun in genral should be smite!|`|QC94lBXOaa	I was raised as a christian and practiced christianity for a good portion of my adult life.

All religions have rules, rituals and laws to follow. Every religion believes that they have the answers for redemption. The answer for redemption through religion, lies within man’s ability to perfectly follow it’s teachings which man can not do.  Jesus is the only one who followed religion perfectly.  <br>  <br>  Jesus is God’s way to reach down to mankind with love, forgiveness, acceptance and grace. Jesus is not a religion. He is God and He is the way for man to have fellowship with God. <br>  <br>  When we come to Jesus, we are full of the original sin nature and the sins that we have committed. He cleanses us when we accept Him as our Lord and Savior and repent of those sins. <br>  <br>  Our redemption and salvation results from Jesus’ willful and sacrificial death on the cross to take our place for our sin nature and our sins. He is the only atonement possible because He is without sin. Jesus does it for us because we are incapable of following any religion perfectly. He did follow the law perfectly.<br>  <br>  Coming to Jesus as our Lord and our Savior, not religion,  is what God requires for us to become forgiven, sanctified, and have the personal relationship with God that He intended from the start. Jesus is the only way to God.|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	I've studied several religions during my life.  I had to go to catholic school while I was little for one year, that cured me of all religion.  :)  I've read the bible more than once, studied Buddhism, the Tao, I-Ching, christianism, etc.  All of them, in my opinion, are just several different opinions of the same God.<br>  <br>  None of them are 'right.'  All of them are man made.  God never said to seek religion.  Love is the greatest aspect of God, not religion.<br>  <br>  The kkk think that they are the 'masters' of the christian religion!  Where in the bible did Jesus say to worship your own race?  If I recall he said to Love everyone, including your neighbor.  They really slam the Jews harshly, for one, yet Jesus was a Jew.  What is up with that? <br>  <br>  This just shows how terribly out of control the christian religion has become over the years.  It is nothing more than man's alter ego that wrote the many bibles of the world to suit their own needs and desires.<br>  <br>  If one is truly sincere about seeking God, religion isn't a requirement.  That's what I've learned about religion.  God cannot be contained by religion or mankind within the confines of a book.|`|V8Lyc2Jlaa	What do you think makes a right religion? In most cases, it's the ideas inside it. Then again, you're perfectly capable of deciding on what the good ideas are, without having to read any religious books, right?<br>  I'm not saying you shouldn't study religions. Religions are a useful tool to understanding what was going through the minds of those particular people, at that particular time. But you shouldn't be shaping your life to fit what was going through the minds of any particular people, at any particular time: you should shape it to fit what's going through YOUR mind, RIGHT NOW.

Allowing people of a different sexual orientation to have the same rights and protections that heterosexual couples have is different than allowing two related persons to marry. The reason that gay marriage is deemed 'indecent' by some, is the lack of proper education about homosexuals and homosexuality. The reason why incestuous marriage is deemed 'indecent' by some, is the fact that we are quite educated about the negative effects that are a product of incest. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, polygamy is not a sexual orientation. It is a lifestyle. Homosexuality is completely different from a man wanting 20 wives. <br>  <br>  Homosexuality: Orientation<br>  Polygamy: Excess<br>  Incest: Biological disaster|`|8ZUVToXgaa	You're crazy!|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Sorry, but I'm not aware of large numbers of relatives wanting to marry each other. In fact, other than an occasional set of first cousins, who can legally marry in some places, I don't know of anyone wanting to marry a close relative.

There is no valid reason to prohibit it, if all parties are consenting.|`|AA10723657	hold on gay marriage and incest are two different kettles of fish at least we are not nailing our siblings which is sick. go ask some one that cares you have got the wrong section to be asking that in.|`|67SW7hamaa	Incestuous relationships can spawn defective children, while polygamy and homosexuality don't.

Gay marriage being the right thing to do doesn't make marriage between close relatives the right thing to do.  It has no bearing on it at all.|`|8OXVSoe0aa	Yea there is a major difference between the 2. <br>  #1. Most people who get married have sex. And if a brother and sister have sex then there is an increased chance that the baby will be mentally challenged. So incest wouldn't be healthy for the baby. Plus I mean I don't get how anyone can be attracted to your sibling unless you were step siblings who have never seen each other before and didn't know it.<br>  <br>  And polygamy is multiple people. The point of marriage is to find the ONE person that you love more than anyone. Not 5 people. And since I know you're probably stupid enough to use bestiality as an example I'll talk about that. Bestiality is wrong because you don't know what the animal wants. And chances are it doesnt want to be raped.<br>  <br>  So why is it so wrong for 2 guys to get married? Or 2 girls? Who is it hurting? Incest, bestiality, and polygamy either defy marriage (more than 2 people) or can hurt someone else.|`|I7V1GwS1aa	I doubt it.<br>  Sister/brother relations may result in offspring with deformities/diabilities, and that's probably the biggest problem and would be difficult to fight.<br>  <br>  Maybe a better question involving incest would be if it was brother/brother and sister/sister relationships since they wouldn't be able to produce children with deformities/disabilities .|`|vL8JErXNaa	Gosh what a concept.

Not just from whites. Thanks for the history lesson, but many of know this already. The ones who are actually racist will not take the time to read your comment.

I believe that there is racism against every ethnic group including caucasians. Where I live, I can't get hired at the local grocery store because I am white. I would never believe for a second that racism is gone. Did you know that slavery was completely legal in Mauritania until the 1980's? Basically the black people with a lighter tint to their skin were higher in status and black people with darker skin were slaves. This is a very recent event that took place in our history and I don't expect people to change their minds so quickly. <br>  <br>  But yeah... it kinda sucks lolz<br>  <br>  EDIT: Ok, I just read a bunch of other comments and it annoys me that people on here are labeling white people as bad guys.

But there are also good white people like there are good black people and aboriginal etc... Skin color does not define the person!! <br>  <br>  The person above me quoted that white people don't believe there is racism because it doesn't happen to them... WRONG!!

It could happen. We can spend all of eternity taking turns being victims and oppressors. Because at any given time the people with the privileges refuse to fight for equal rights for all. Because they like it the way it is, and think things will never change. Personally I think blacks should fight for and accept equal rights now while whites are still brainwashed. Because it's starting to wear off. The white guilt brainwashing doesn't match the reality we live every day. And many whites are starting to get pissed off about that. How in the hell can legal victims of racism be oppressors?

And which is the true God and so on and on...yet when they speak of "their God" they always look up (interesting)<br>  God is in your heart. If you don't embrace another way of worshiping, "keep thine own counsel,  Worship your way, it's called freedom of religion and tolerance . We all know that the many horrors have been committed in the name of the Lord, had nothing to do with The Lord.<br>  "Seek Ye first the kingdom of heaven"<br>  And as for anyone you find at fault leave them to heaven. No one is pure enough to judge another.<br>  God is always in the hearts of all of us and he forgives quicker than we do.  But his wrath is swift and overwhelming<br>  You don't need to be taught you are fine, just the way you are.  If your way of thinking harms no one, it is your right. When the time is right you will learn for yourself, what it is that you are seeking, or the time may never be right and you will forge ahead seeking your answers<br>  As for Me and my loved ones, we will continue to seek our truth from The Lord and Praise him for redemption through Jesus. <br>  God is love<br>  Angel.|`|AyPF2TFlaa	I don't believe they do.<br>  I believe it happens only when someone shows bigotry towards their belief.|`|11a867519828ee7f2df6eda7cb34fb8faa	If you are debating with someone who is calling you names, stop and move on.

The Church teaches that God will judge each of us according to what is in our hearts. God and God alone will determine who gets into heaven and who does not. <br>  <br>  I am not sure where you are getting your information on what the Church teaches but your source is woefully short on facts.<br>  <br>  <br>  Paragraph 846: "They could not be saved who, knowing that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would refuse either to enter it or to remain in it."<br>  <br>  Do you truly believe that the Catholic Church is founded by God and if you do do you refuse to enter it or remain in it. If not you don't have to worry because the truth has not been revealed to you.<br>  <br>  Paragraph 868: "The Church is catholic: she proclaims the fullness of the faith. She bears in herself and administers the totality of the means of salvation."<br>  <br>  The Church is catholic or Universal, for everyone. The Church on earth provides the fullness of the faith and thru her you are saved. If you do not believe this and truly do not accept this does not mean you are going to go to hell. God will judge you on what you believe to be the truth and the way.<br>  <br>  Paragraph 1493: “One who desires to obtain reconciliation with God and with the Church, must confess to a priest all the unconfessed grave sins he remembers after having carefully examined his conscience."<br>  <br>  This deals with Apostolic succession. The Church teaches that its Bishops and Priests form an unbroken line of succession back to the Apostles. Jesus told the Apostles that what they forgave was forgiven and what they bound on earth (did not forgive) was bound in heaven. The Church holds that this was passed on from the Apostles to the current Church. Once agian you dont have to believe it for you will be judged on what you truly believe to be the truth. <br>  <br>  Peace.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	I'm Catholic and no one's ever called me a Bigfoot.

TAGsuqu2aa	Country people are more content with how mellow their lifestyle is. <br>  City people thrive for change and are constantly on the move.<br>  <br>  One can be successful with a wonderful family life, and mediocre financial stability. <br>  One can be successful with the money making power, but no family life to soothe one soul. <br>  One could careless about the success of family life and opt to be greedy instead. <br>  <br>  Statements of sucess can be viewed very differently depending on how we live our lives, but to compare country and city people there is no way to say one is better than the other.|`|KJaa8ya1aa	I've seen country people who live in shacks that would be condemned in the cities, in fact, there are some who prefer that lifestyle so they can spend their money on alcohol, junk food, gas-sucking 20-year old pickups and cigarettes. The men especially like it so they can kick the dog, and beat their wife and kids out of sight and earshot of their neighbors. Pretty common here.|`|CugCzH9iaa	Hu???  I actually tend to think that the opposite is true!  <br>  <br>  Some in the country do have a lot of money because they can afford the land and nice house to go with it but everyone that I know that lives in the country DO NOT  have that.  They have the land but not the nice house.  I guess it depends on what you mean by success.  Money or happiness.  My in-laws live in the country and LOVE it.  But they are not what you would call successful.  They are happy though...no traffic to fight or people living on top of you.

AA10200229	I agree with you 100%!!! Smoker's are disgusting, selfish, horrible people! They only think about themselves and they're own needs and not about how it affects anyone else. I agree with the post above about people not smoking in cars with children should be banned and pregnant women not smoking, because that is FORCING it upon helpless victims!<br>  <br>  Smokers complain about how they should have the right to smoke and pollute and litter wherever, but they're only complaining about that because they are too stupid, weak, or lazy to quit. There is NO reason why someone can't quit smoking these days with all the resources available (many for free). Smokers are just stupid and selfish!<br>  <br>  I think there should be very large fines levied against those smokers who litter and brake rules that should be in place. The majority of Americans DON'T SMOKE, so why should we (the majority) be bothered by a minority of people who complain about wanting to do something that they really don't need to do anyway! I have no sympathy for smokers, and if their smoking addiction kills a few of them off - then I say it serves them right!|`|QiBBgOA5aa	people have the right to smoke where they want|`|EZ5mwUF3aa	You're worried about air pollution yet I'm sure you're driving a car...<br>  The government should not dictate on what people can and can't do, pretty soon freedom of speech is history also.<br>  You would have done well in East Germany.|`|rThIVk2maa	A bit more civility on both sides of that issue would prevent the heavy hand of the law from turning what should be common courtesy into an indifferent law.|`|f0ab5773489610816891e78f27e89a12aa	I think there should be designated areas outside, not a total ban.

ZmdIlkpQaa	I disagree with you.  I don't know if love can be proved scientifically, but I certainly know it exists.  I've been in love with a woman for more than 24 years, and whether you could measure that love or not, it's as real as gravity.  <br>  <br>  I guess I don't understand what you're driving at.  Whether or not love exists for you, it does for many people, and I'm not sure why you feel the need to assert that it doesn't exist.  Of course, by the same token, those of us who are in love really don't need to try to convince you, either, I suppose.<br>  <br>  Have a great day!|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	This sounds like one for the atheist:  I know that xyz does not exist, but I cannot prove it (even though the evidence for it is staring them right in the face)|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	Cynical question or sarcastic question?  I'm guessing the latter.  So...if you believe in Love which can't be proved how can you demand proof for God?  Is that your game?  You've got a point.|`|k3LbhASGaa	Sure it does , I think you just need to hang out with people who will love and respect you instead of hate and abuse you|`|WseLyvSpaa	Love does exist, in the same way that the idea for the book I wrote but never got published and erased from my hard-drive exists...In the mind.  Love can be explained scientifically as a complex set of human emotions having to do with sex, sensuality, relationship and involving multiple neuro-transmitters and hormones and various neuronal nuclei in the brain.  It's a feeling though, right?  Just like the mind, personality, conscience, joy and fear.  It's not a thing (like the brain) or a material substance in it's own right!  But it can be explained by science.  It is materialistic in the big sense.|`|3AAJqErnaa	I think you meant to ask "why do people believe that love is one specific emotion, when that one specific emotion  does not exist?"<br>  <br>  If you are asking me that then question...Then I can say that you are correct because love is not an emotion, it a culmination of several different emotions that are grouped and labeled as love. <br>  <br>  Love can be a combination of more than one emotion... it can never be just a emotion, because that emotion already has a title or label. Several emotions in combination with others like: Love can be happiness, sadness, it can be sorrow or mourning (love sick), it can euphoric and heightened (in love), it can be obsession and longing (addicted to love), protective and paternal (mothers love for child)  ....<br>  <br>  But one specific emotion to love does not exist. One can't say that one specific emotion is love. Because love does not have that one specific emotion. But when you combine several emotions, you then have a notion of the feeling of love. <br>  <br>  Every emotion has a name..... but love has no specific emotion... just a grouping of several.  <br>  <br>  Salutations|`|M2UWOTAjaa	For a mystic, you're mighty strange.<br>  Personal love produces ecstasy without drugs.<br>  It protects babies from danger and shows them how to trust people through good examples set by the parent, with frequent hugging and play, for example.<br>  Love is the bridge  between freedom and responsibility.

If a griffin came up against the dog-sized dragons of England it would not be much of a contest. Now if it's the Norse variety, which is approximately what modern people think a dragon should look like, it's a draw because Norse dragons were larger and breathed a lot of fire but were also generally landbound.<br>  <br>  If it's a kilometers long Asian dragon...it's a bad day to be an English griffin. Best to find new mythological territory that's well away from such a dangerous opponent.|`|8OREBeRdaa	I'd say a dragon would have the edge but it depends on the type of dragon.  Dragons tend to have the following offensive combat capabilities: bite, 2 claws,<br>  Some dragons have tails that can be used as weapons. Others have extra set of arms - therefore, more claws to deal with. Many sets of dragon wings have wing claws or curved tips that can be used for slashing. That's before we get into fire breathing.<br>  <br>  A dragon's hide is more akin to a lizard therefore would tend to be more armored than a griffin's.  <br>  <br>  Although a griffin has a curved beak, and possibly 2 sets of talons, they tend to be less aggressive than dragons.  Otherwise there would be more legends about heroes defeating them right?|`|AA12384132	The one that struck first has a better chance or winning that fight..............|`|I93ynnVfaa	DON'CHA KNOW- it all depends on BIORHYTHMS...!
RJiyFKWbaa	This will earn massive thumbs down and criticism but I answer in truth.<br>  Catholicism. In all religious studies I have undertook that religious group is the most off beat far from the truth as any I have encountered. Most beliefs are contrary to Biblical teaching. They have created their own doctrines and laws replacing the ones Christ taught and observed.<br>  They have broken the ten commandments one by one, they have altered the sabbath day that God ordained and set for us. They have incorporated Pagan beliefs and religious Holy Days into their religion there by poisoning all religions that have branched from them like Lutheran and those of the Protestant Reformation. Lets not even mention the despicable habits of many of their priests.

That's the same thing as saying that God has made us wrong. The Great god that created the world in 6 days(he rested on the 7th) created us wrong.

Kidding!|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	I find people that beleive that Unsolved Mysteries and most other paranormal shows are to be factual are equally idiotic.<br>  <br>  **ADD**<br>  Actually only those who haven't experienced ghosts who watch tv and movies about ghosts beleive those things to be factual. And seeing as how you aren't a ghost yet, wait until then to tell us what ghosts will or will not do.<br>  <br>  And for the record, ghosts are NOT always residual hauntings. There are very very few cases of intelligent haunting, but regardless they do exist. Poltergeist activity isn't an actual ghost but usually stems from the subconcious of teens and pre-teens. Seldom does poltergeist activity occur around people who are not of a hormonal state such as a teen.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Okay.  Just remember that when you're dead.  If for whatever reason, you don't "go into the light" and you end up becoming a ghost - no throwing bread or moving chairs in attempts to get the attention of the living to communicate whatever it is you stuck around to try to accomplish.  Mind you, you'll not have a physical body anymore, so you'll have to learn how to manifest your energy in a way as to attract the attention of the living and figure out how to communicate with them.  You may get frustrated and have a little temper tantrum and feel like throwing something.   Best to just keep in mind that when you die, you should cross over, no matter what business you may think you need to stick around and finish.  That way you don't put yourself in the position to be potentially acting like an idiot.<br>  <br>  As far as your current physical life though - I dunno - may be a different story there.  You'd have to check with those who know you to see if they think you ever act like an idiot.|`|7c0eb610d871f4900af356753fbd90b4aa	ghosts are not spirits<br>  ghosts are what is called residual energy ... just like a memory<br>  but it isnt ghosts who throw things<br>  it isnt some silly immature dead person doing these things ... it is the living people in the area<br>  this is called poltergeist energy and is different to both ghosts and spirit|`|bqkfu6Diaa	They are not acting.

For that matter, the authors never expected their writings to become "scripture".  The Jewish texts of the Septuagint were their scriptures and Jesus was returning before there would be any need for more.  When that didn't happen, people started expressing opinions about which writings were inspired, making the New Testament essentially a list of favorites, a list that wasn't finalized until the Fourth Century, which was about the time of the earliest surviving manuscripts.  And these manuscripts vary from later copies only by a word or verse here and there.  Any doctrines derived from later versions is a matter of interpretation, not actual content.|`|macZI2dzaa	Not quite sure about your question.  You could be more specific.<br>      The New Testament is the most well documented ancient text in the world.  The translations that we now have of the New Testament have significant accuracy across the board, with only a few exceptions (like the New World Translation).  Manuscripts that support the original writings of the New Testament have been found that were copied within 25 years of the original author's life.  This is unheard of among ancient texts.<br>      Unfortunately, it has always been a few that follow Jesus' way that is outlined in the New Testament.  He predicted that when He said, "Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and many follow it.  Small is the gate and narrow is the way that leads to life and few there be that find it."|`|AA12346187	no one  has  lost  any   so called first  bible.    the   originals  were written in  Aramaic and  Greek  so had to be translated  for  us to read in English or a native  tongue.  translation  does change  with time as   language does  hence the need to update  the translations.<br>  <br>    the old  testament was from  before Jesus and the new  about his  life and the start of the church  none was lost.|`|Xg1ZR4ptaa	My first bible had a bunch of pics on them, when I grew up I game it to my little bro.

AA10451488	First... take a deep breath and consider this...<br>  It's not about him, her, OR you. It's about a baby who has done nothing wrong. This child deserves both parents and a peaceful childhood more than anything. <br>  <br>  I personally would not go to this meeting, but if your BF insists that you come along and really needs the moral support - it is do-able. You can arrive, introduce yourself politely, and excuse yourself so that they may have privacy to talk. Step away and go read a book or something. You could use this opportunity to bring a "peace offering" and grab a coffee on the way for all three of you. Be the bigger person. I think it's also a very nice idea to bring the baby a gift, too. <br>  <br>  As for what to wear - for the love of God - don't wear anything revealing! You don't need this woman spouting off about his "new GF the $lut". Dress casually and tastefully. If you can't wear it to an Elementary School then don't wear it.|`|17fc727d7da626634a4721e34bc49363aa	It would be best for you if your bf didn't put you in such an uncomfortable position.  If he is any kind of father, he'll have the kid for visitation rights and you can meet the kid there.  <br>  <br>  Really, he is wrong to put you in that situation.  Don't let yourself get put between a rock and a hard place.  The kid will still be there when the former ol' lady isn't.  If he insists, you may need to reevaluate your choice of main squeeze.|`|TXddP0uxaa	Amy is right.  There is a huge opportunity for a lot of drama and anger in this situation:  don't be the one to cause it.  The reason she doesn't want you there is not because she wants anything to do with your man or anything like that.  She wants it perfectly clear that SHE is this child's mother and has the final say when it comes to him.  Any mother will feel that way.  Having another woman in the picture is threatening.  Don't be a threat.  Be gracious and polite to her and otherwise stay out of it.  She can't keep you from coming, and I actually agree that is it a little immature to try, but if you do go, just step back and let the two of them handle it.  If she makes rude comments to you, just let them roll off your back and let them go.  Getting in an argument with her is only going to make things harder for the child.|`|giBfNMX6aa	DO NOT GO.  This is a pathetic attempt on your bf's part to distance himself from the situation.  Put yourself in her shoes.  If you go, it will be like a slap in the face to her.  Again, don't do it, you'll regret it.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	If he asked you to go, I would go so he has someone to keep him company and help him feel more comfortable. However, I don't think that this meeting should involve you.
flV8NKruaa	From a certain point of view, it is accurate. A baby's bones have not fully hardened like an adults. They still have a large amount of cartilage between bones and many bones have not yet fused. This allows them to withstand impact and resist breaking bones. This is also what allows them to go through the birth canal during pregnancy.  When they are born, their bones actually flex and move so that they can fit through.<br>  <br>  However, a fall from a tall building is a stretch. any serious fall can severely damage a child's development.  Keep in mind that a baby also has less developed organs as well as bones, so a fall would impact the development of those organs for the rest of his/her life. Furthermore, a less developed organ would not be able to recover as well as an adult organ. That is why babies cannot drink anything but milk for the first months of life. Their organs just can process anything else.|`|ShWjnOrBaa	because they are still developing and they're bones are softer|`|jcqa41rcaa	Babies are smaller, lighter, and are much moreflexible than adults. Damage to the skull would be your biggest concern if you dropped a baby down a flight of stairs. Babies have "soft spots" on their skull because their skull isn't fully developed and this makes them more susceptable to brain damage.|`|jUdqsRfOaa	They are more "squishier" like, their bones are completely solid, so they prolly won't damage as easily, still, don't drop you babies

FGcwxZz0aa	I contend that Scriptures cannot be reconciled with the Calvinist inspired belief in OSAS. OSAS is certainly a doctrine from hell saying that one cannot fall away from the faith regardless of their sinfulness. That all that is required is a one time emotional recognition of Christ and they are forever justified, sanctified and saved for all eternity. They can remain sinful creatures in reality but Christ’s blood will cover that sin so that they can be smuggled into heaven as a dirty sinful soul. Yet the person who is not a sinful person has no hope of heaven unless he has this one emotional recognition of Christ. That would tend to make one question the just nature of God.<br>  <br>  <br>  Let us start out with Romans 10 that Calvinists use to prove OSAS and site verses 14-17. They read as follows: <br>  <br>  (Rom 10:14 DRB) How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? Or how shall they believe him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?<br>  <br>  (Rom 10:15 DRB) And how shall they preach unless they be sent, as it is written: How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, of them that bring glad tidings of good things?<br>  <br>  (Rom 10:16 DRB) But all do not obey the gospel. For Isaias saith: Lord, who hath believed our report?<br>  <br>  (Rom 10:17 DRB) Faith then cometh by hearing; and hearing by the word of Christ.<br>  <br>  Obviously these verses have nothing to do with Calvin’s doctrine of eternal security but instead speak of our commission by Christ to spread the Gospel.<br>  <br>  Calvinists will then offer as proof John 6 verses 37-40. They read as follows: <br>  <br>  (Joh 6:37 DRB) All that the Father giveth to me shall come to me: and him that cometh to me, I will not cast out.<br>  <br>  (Joh 6:38 DRB) Because I came down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me.<br>  <br>  (Joh 6:39 DRB) Now this is the will of the Father who sent me: that of all that he hath given me, I should lose nothing; but should raise it up again in the last day.<br>  <br>  (Joh 6:40 DRB) And this is the will of my Father that sent me: that every one who seeth the Son and believeth in him may have life everlasting. And I will raise him up in the last day.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are a couple of things being taught here. First of all Jesus is making it clear that He is not working independently from the Father but is within the will of the Father. Secondly, Jesus was giving assurance of all that come to Him that if they trust in Him and believe that they can rely in Him to overcome the snares of Satan which could cause them to fall away. They are not immune to the seduction of temptation but through the grace given by Christ may endure to the end. If one was to try to use these verses to support OSAS they would have to acknowledge the meaning here to be in support of universal salvation. Theses verses do not support OSAS or universal salvation. <br>  <br>  The following is a posting of a portion of John 6:44-45 used to support OSAS. It reads as follows:<br>  <br>  (Joh 6:44 DRB) No man can come to me, except the Father, who hath sent me, draw him. And I will raise him up in the last day.<br>  <br>  (Joh 6:45 DRB) It is written in the prophets: And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath heard of the Father and hath learned cometh forth me.<br>  <br>  Again these verses do not support universal salvation as they may appear nor do they support OSAS. In verse 44 Jesus is affirming that it is the Father through the Holy Spirit that brings people to faith and is relating to the teaching of the prophet Isaiah who speaks of the law being written on each person’s heart that is surrendered to for initial salvation. Jesus is reminding us that it is God’s grace and the Spirit in harmony with the Father that initiates salvation and does not come only from a response within ourselves as a result of free will.<br>  <br>  In verse 45 is actually presenting prophecy about the Messianic kingdom where people will be taught directly by God and was referring directly to the following prophecies:<br>  <br>  (Isa 54:13 DRB) All thy children shall be taught of the Lord: and great shall be the peace of thy children.<br>  <br>  (Jer 31:31 DRB) Behold the days shall come, saith the Lord, and I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Juda:<br>  <br>  (Jer 31:32 DRB) Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, the covenant which they made void, and I had dominion over them, saith the Lord.<br>  <br>  (Jer 31:33 DRB) But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my law in their bowels, and I will write it in their heart: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.<br>  <br>  (Jer 31:34 DRB) And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying: Know the Lord: for all shall know me from the least of them even to the greatest, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.<br>  <br>  <br>  Again, neither Jesus nor the prophets are teaching universal salvation or OSAS in verse 45. Jesus is speaking that not mere hearing of the Word is enough but we must learn what the Word of God teaches. We are taught by the prophets, by the apostles and their successors through the Church, by Sacred Tradition which contains the written and oral teaching of God and by the gift of discernment from the Spirit. We must open ourselves to all of these to receive the truth as all of these are God’s gift to humanity so that we may endure to eternity.<br>  <br>  <br>  Calvinists often use the following as proof texts: John 10:27-30 to support OSAS. Here is what they say:<br>  <br>  (Joh 10:27 DRB) My sheep hear my voice. And I know them: and they follow me.<br>  <br>  (Joh 10:28 DRB) And I give them life everlasting: and they shall not perish for ever. And no man shall pluck them out of my hand.<br>  <br>  (Joh 10:29 DRB) That which my Father hath given me is greater than all: and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my Father.<br>  <br>  (Joh 10:30 DRB) I and the Father are one.<br>  <br>  The verses provided refer to Jesus’ previous discourse before the festival. He explains who His sheep are. He describes His sheep as follows:<br>  <br>  1. Those who hear His voice in faith.<br>  2. Who are known by God as loving Him.<br>  3. Those who follow Him by keeping His commandments.<br>  <br>  Jesus goes on to say that those who meet His three conditions also receive three promises:<br>  <br>  1. I give them eternal life. (Please note that He did not say, “I will” give them, which would indicate that they must continue in a state of ongoing sanctification and belief.) <br>  2. It is provisional on their abiding in God’s love that they will receive the gift of eternal life.<br>  3. Those that continue to believe and follow Christ and endure to final salvation are assured of eternal life. A perseverance to believe, love, and obey God is necessary to abide in the assurance in the hand of God.<br>  <br>  These verses do not support the lawlessness of OSAS<br>  <br>  Continuing we are given the following verses in the book of Acts 10 verses 34-45 as support for OSAS:<br>  <br>  (Act 10:34 DRB) And Peter opening his mouth, said: in very deed I perceive that God is not a respecter of persons.<br>  <br>  (Act 10:35 DRB) But in every nation, he that feareth him and worketh justice is acceptable to him.<br>  <br>  (Act 10:36 DRB) God sent the word to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all).<br>  <br>  (Act 10:37 DRB) You know the word which hath been published through all Judea: for it began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached.<br>  <br>  (Act 10:38 DRB) Jesus of Nazareth: how God anointed him with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.<br>  <br>  (Act 10:39 DRB) And we are witnesses of all things that he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem: whom they killed, hanging him upon a tree.<br>  <br>  (Act 10:40 DRB) Him God raised up the third day and gave him to be made manifest,<br>  <br>  (Act 10:41 DRB) Not to all the people, but to witnesses preordained by God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him, after he arose again from the dead.<br>  <br>  (Act 10:42 DRB) And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that it is he who was appointed by God to be judge of the living and of the dead.<br>  <br>  (Act 10:43 DRB) To him all the prophets give testimony, that by his name all receive remission of sins, who believe in him.<br>  <br>  (Act 10:44 DRB) While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them that heard the word.<br>  <br>  (Act 10:45 DRB) And the faithful of the circumcision, who came with Peter, were astonished for that the grace of the Holy Ghost was poured out upon the Gentiles also.<br>  <br>  In these verses we see the greater message of the struggle of St. Peter over the issue of Gentile converts with the passage ending with both Cornelius and St Peter realizing that they were dependent on each other: Cornelius needed St Peter to receive the Gospel message and know the way to salvation. Peter needed Cornelius and his salvation experience to realize that the Gentiles were included in God’s plan for salvation.<br>  <br>  Verses 37-43 contain one of St. Peter’s greatest sermons stating the Gospel. It includes the servanthood of Jesus, death on the cross and resurrection which he personally experienced. He emphasized the fulfillment of Scriptures by Christ as well as the necessity of ongoing belief in Him. While these verses are some of my personal favorites they do nothing to support a belief in OSAS.<br>  <br>  continued >>>>><br>  <br>  <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-S6YMuFYyaa9ESBoW5DFwEjL_HhqA?tag=oncesavedalwayssaved">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-S6YMuFYya...</a><br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr.

A down payment of money as I want the property and here is partial payment until I can give you the rest of the money.<br>  <br>  The holy spirit is the down payment given to us of the eternal inheritance we will receive until we are taken to heaven to receive the rest.

We are not God, and cannot know his perfect justice. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a gift, but it can be rejected or returned at any time. We must never assume.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Absolutely, given the complete lack of evidence of even the EXISTENCE of Hell...|`|NrjGBiV2aa	No, its voluptuous|`|IMSkR8Ajaa	No. Christ said in John 10:28-29 "And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand." <br>  <br>  Assurance of Salvation has nothing to do with free will. Assurance of Salvation says that once we freely accept Christ as our Savior, then we will always be saved. We have already come to God freely when we accepted Him! It is not "blackmailing" God because the Bible tells us "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." (Romans 10-9-10) God has promised me that once I accepted Christ as Savior, He would hold on to me and not let me go, and I could swing over Hell on a rotten grape vine and never have fear because I KNOW that I am saved and on my way to Heaven because God said so. I am not making this up, I am just telling you what the Bible says.<br>  <br>  Ephesians 4:30 says "And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption." We are sealed which means "to mark with a seal for security" and gives the idea of a letter being sealed shut.<br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 1:21-22 says "Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts."<br>  <br>  I know that I am saved because God says so in His Word.<br>  Romans 3:4 "...let God be true, but every man a liar..."<br>  <br>  Edit: I am not Calvinistic in that I do not believe in Predestination. I do believe that people can backslide as Peter did when he denied Christ, but I believe that He was still saved/he didn't lose his salvation.|`|d69d49545272c36ef0603d8151da8422aa	Presumptuous and arrogant both.<br>  <br>  I like you, reject that doctrine.<br>  <br>  As far as who is going to heaven my money is more on the Jew than the fundy guy, but I do not know either.|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	If by "assurance of salvation" you mean "once saved,always saved" i.e. the notion of the perseverence of the saints and the sovereignity of of God's will in predestination, then I have to say that, as usual, the Bible is of two minds on this issue. It's not blackmail to expect God to deliver what He has promised, but that is the key issue. has God indeed promised paradise to everyone who recites the sinner's prayer?<br>  <br>  Catholic Answers covers your side of the argument well. <br>  <br>  Bible.Org covers the opposing arguments.<br>  <br>  The fact that you can argue convincingly either way from scripture simply demonstrates to me that it is not a unified inspired message of God, but in any case should give the Christian pause before making arrogant presumption..|`|nHizaTiDaa	Salvation is not saying words, doing rites and rituals and saying many prayers at the right time to the right spot...<br>  <br>  It is actually becoming indwelled with God's Spirit.

Maybe more than even they realize. Jesus came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many. God sent his Son into the world not to judge the world, but to save the world. Like a shepard guards his sheep, he wants everyone to be in the fold safe and secure. That includes Muslims and Jews. There is no judgment against anyone who believes in him. But anyone who does not believe in him has already been judged for not believing in God's one and only Son. And the judgment is based on this fact: God's light came into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light, for their actions were evil. All who do evil hate the light and refuse to go near it for fear their sins will be exposed. But those who do what is right come to the light so others can see that they are doing what God wants.|`|ygbhsZ2Zaa	Do you realize that just because you worship a dead Jew, we aren't obligated to you?<br>  <br>  He can have his Jewish family, friends and community to remind him of the love of HIS OWN god, not some 3:1 idol.<br>  <br>  Nice of you to care for a friend, but don't lay your religion on us- we have our own and unlike yours, ours is able to stand alone.|`|FFqWeIX7aa	They didn't even recognized your three head god...<br>  <br>  =)|`|K8QTdUnfaa	Do Catholics realize their importance to Mormons?|`|ea2395751480a69caa92c51b9cfe1156aa	Do loonies realise their importance to other loonies?|`|rDxksI3naa	Kyle from south park is a jew<br>  <br>  :)|`|VAfecn52aa	ask them|`|5T2rZmcYaa	Don't patronize her, and don't belittle her struggles.|`|9YMLsk7Taa	The jewish nation/people are Gods chosen people!

In Judaism, being angry at God is considered a religious repsonse.

And I don't know of many Christian groups that would encourage a Jew to continue practicing Judaism -- that really says a lot about you. :-)<br>  <br>  Now I do respect those Jews out there who are good people and happen to be atheists -- even if I don't agree with their religious philosophy, they are using their minds and independently making choices, which is an admirable thing in itself. There are many Jews who may not believe that G-d exists in the traditional sense but continue to follow the traditions for the sake of morality and peoplehood.<br>  <br>  But I agree with you, we need to support and defend each other. We are facing so many societal problems today, and we definitely need to continue forming interfaith alliances in order to make our communities more peaceful. :-)

It is the day before Easter and the last day of Holy Week, in which Christians prepare for Easter.<br>  <br>  On this day the church commemorates the time that Jesus Christ lay in the tomb and that he descended into heaven.<br>  <br>  In Roman Catholic Churches, the sanctuary remains stripped completely bare (following the Mass on Maundy Thursday) while the administration of the sacraments is severely limited. Holy Communion Is given only as Viaticum to the dying. All Masses are strictly prohibited. No Mass at all appears in the liturgy for this day. Many of the churches of the Anglican Communion as well as Lutheran, Methodist, and some other Churches observe most of the same; however, their altars may be covered in black instead of being stripped.<br>  <br>  In some Anglican churches, including the Episcopal Church in the United States, provision is made for a simple Liturgy of the Word on this day, with readings commemorating the burial of Christ, but no Eucharist.<br>  <br>  Liturgically speaking, Holy Saturday lasts until dusk, after which the Easter Vigil is celebrated, marking the official start of the Easter season. In Roman Catholic observance, during the "Gloria" of the Mass (which is the first Mass since that of Holy Thursday), the church statues and icons, in places where they are covered with purple veils during Passiontide, are dramatically unveiled.|`|B6r56Nr7aa	Wow, Fireball and Rene-O gave such stupid answers. <br>  <br>  The Apostles never celebrated Christmas and you do. <br>  <br>  See, I combat stupid logic by using it against people who only know stupid logic.|`|jsM8F4bLaa	some do, some dont. <br>  <br>  As Paul said, the sabbath is the day you make it now. :)|`|08ae3d05d7e2c113fc49e08dbdcfa338aa	They don't <br>  <br>  <br>  Rene<br>  The apostles did observe the Sabbeth and so did Jesus.

If you live outside of the Australian residents area and would like to apply to Mercy Ministries, visit their international page <a href="https://www.mercyministries.org/splash.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.mercyministries.org/splash.h...</a> to find your closest Mercy Ministries home or alternatively contact the Mercy Ministries office. <a href="http://www.mercyministries.com.au/pages/default.asp?pid=10" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercyministries.com.au/pages/...</a> .. but i'm sure that were you calling over and over.., other then that be patient and trust God. In the mean time keep reading the bible and make sure the first first thing you doing when you wake up is to pray and talk with God... the more time you spend seeking God then everything else in life will begin to make sense and fall into place as God keeps talking to you. Remember you cannot complete something when it is God and God alone who holds the final piece of the puzzle.
JRBUCImNaa	The NZETC is a British online Database, politics started gettin ugly with Don Brash in office who try and play a card - "to appear" to be in control , The Maori pa in history was something the British had never come across, not because it was an odd fort, but because they were every where and in different forms. from the sea coming into dock you could see Pa lining the the hills when people first arrived, it was a scary sight I wish I could give a pcture, the Maori had built a culture of War- and fro 200 years the British traded weapons to the Maori, around that time people started fleeing from British landlords, and looking for new places to live. there were friendly Maori to new settlers that protected these settlers from even other Maori iwi. Some Pas lookined like pyramids , you should see the pa on Mt. Eden in New Zealand- the whole moutain is carved- <br>  some Pa were able to be built very quickly, and used in a different manner that British used forts. british use a fort and spread from that location outward, Maori would use the Pa some times as bait and a way to cost British amunition since they had to import it and go through Maori iwi port traders to get the ammunition on the island.<br>  The Pa also sometimes had these huge mazes, if you managed to get inside one section, you'd be trapped having to fight into another section, Maori may slip out the back. The Pa was a winning work of maori engineering  that british studied after the wars  to understand the reason of defeat.

It always has been, so I'm not sure where you are getting your ideas from.<br>  <br>  As for worshipping the sun - I would rather worship the One who created it. I would think He must be a lot greater than the object he created, and you apparently think that even THAT is great. Jesus speaking about being "the light" is a metaphor for good. Because the Bible (can't remember which passage now, but I can search for it if you need it) says that you cannot have light without darkness, or good without evil. If you never see darkness, you don't know how good the light is. If you never see evil, you can't appreciate good.|`|373KJjiOaa	Go ahead and do that, but don't forget to wear sunglasses and sunscreen.

Or are you attracted to women because you think it's sexier and you would be happier living with a woman?<br>  <br>  I guess at your age, people like to experiment. If you're curious about having sexual relations with a girl, it doesn't necessarily mean you're bi, it just means that you're curious. You could be bi, but you will never know for sure unless you try it out. I could be wrong, I am not gay, but that's the only way I could think of you being sure.<br>  <br>  Think of it this way. 10 years from now, do you see yourself with a steady boyfriend? Or do you see yourself with a steady girlfriend?<br>  <br>  Everyone goes through a sexual confusion phase. I know it might sound unfair that i'm saying sexual confusion, cuz some people are homosexual and it wouldn't be fair to them if I said it's just curiousity. <br>  <br>  All I can suggest is you try it out, and if you like and it would do it again, well there's your answer. If you try it out and feel uncomfortable or that you would be better suited with a man, then you would be heterosexual.<br>  <br>  Just explore and see what makes you happiest :)|`|JcwjDpY8aa	I also thought I was bi when I was this age.  Your hormones are doing cray things and you wont actually be comfortable with your sexuality until you are older... so why not be curious and experiment with your emotions with women the same way you do as men now... that should help you figure it out.  I thought i liked women too until the time came for opening up with our emotions with each other... that was just too much for me and I "changed my mind" because the nervousness was so much more overpowering with a woman than it was for a man for me...|`|kTD5BvJ2aa	Sure it's possible, but at that age, if you don't have definite straight or gay feelings, it's going to be difficult. since so many 14 year olds made being bi a "fad", it's going to be hard to get people to respect your bisexuality.

ZB9zkbxxaa	According to tradition (the Inca left no written records), the founder of the Incan dynasty led the tribe to Cuzco, which became their capital. Under the fourth emperor, they began to expand, and under the eighth they began a program of permanent conquest by establishing garrisons among the conquered peoples. Under Topa Inca Yupanqui and his successor, the empire reached its southernmost and northernmost extent. By the early 16th century the Inca controlled an empire of some 12 million subjects. They constructed a vast network of roads, their architecture was highly developed, and the remains of their irrigation systems, palaces, temples, and fortifications are still in evidence throughout the Andes. Incan society was highly stratified and featured an aristocratic bureaucracy. Their pantheon, worshiped in a highly organized state religion, included a sun god, a creator god, and a rain god. The Incan empire was overthrown in 1532 by the Spanish conquistadores, who made great use of the Incan road system during their conquests.|`|EeQ6qL52aa	they kicked the crap out of the others and sacrificed chickens|`|Wcscjegnaa	They conquered myan villiages and expanded.

I guess so, we are alive.<br>  <br>  Two rams and a woman in Saudi Arabia<br>  Khaled Al-Sulaiman ARAB NEWS<br>  <br>  We have an entrenched judicial system that is based on Divine Law and not personal whims. This is the reason why I could not understand two recent court verdicts handed out on the same day. <br>  <br>  In the first ruling, two thieves who stole two rams were sentenced to three years imprisonment and 1,000 lashes each. <br>  <br>  The second ruling of two years imprisonment and 200 whiplashes was for a husband who beat his wife until she swallowed her tongue and died.<br>  <br>  I could not find any explanation for the great difference in the two rulings although they were reached under the same law. Are the two rams more valuable than the woman or is the life of a human being cheaper than that of livestock?<br>  <br>  I am not evaluating the judicial system or delving into the parameters of the rulings. I’m just trying to understand how some judges think and issue their verdicts? It might be true that the woman was killed unintentionally and the rams were stolen with intent, but this will not answer the questions that arise from the two verdicts.<br>  <br>  I doubt very much the Ministry of Justice will include the two verdicts in its records because they contradict the picture that the ministry is trying to draw that court verdicts are based on principles of fairness and not the personal views of judges.<br>  <br>  I know that the judiciary has a spirit that is not separated from the recorded text and which judges cannot do without while carrying out their duties. However, some amazing rulings make us doubtful of this spirit.<br>  <br>  In the West, we often hear about contradicting rulings in almost identical cases. However, these contradictions should not exist here as our justice is based on Shariah, not personal assessment or whims even if the case was of two rams whose destiny we do not know.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Perhaps a visit to the Kentucky Creation Museum would help.<br>  <br>  Check out this lovely diorama (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Creation_Museum_10.png" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Creati...</a> ) in the Creation Museum (<a href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/ars-takes-a-field-trip-the-creation-museum.ars" rel="nofollow">http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/...</a> ) showing Eve sitting in a very sexy frock next to an over sized velociraptor.<br>  <br>  I also love the photo of a parent hoisting his child onto a saddled tricertops (<a href="http://media.arstechnica.com/news.media/400/526893292_e95eb57c10.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://media.arstechnica.com/news.media/...</a> ).|`|dbgQgYscaa	They would have to, or God couldn't have evolved Adam and Eve to a human form.

eR9szWIYaa	There are a few possibilities with this. Being a bisexual female often attracts the wrong guys in HS. For me, being quiet about my sexual preference in HS was easier because I didn't want to attract guys that only wanted the sexual aspect of me.<br>  <br>  As far as attracting girls, it works about the same as attracting guys. The hard part is being brave enough to do something about it. I had one serious girlfriend in HS (we were friends first) and it started with me mentioning something I had read about homosexuality that I completely thought was bogus (some states not allowing homosexuals to adopt). She had pretty much the same viewpoint as I did and we just kept talking about the "gay/straight/bi" issues as we refer to it. Once you know where someone else stands as far as sexual orientation or at least their openness to it, it makes it a lot easier to decide to take the next step.<br>  <br>  Just like in any potential relationship, you have to watch for signals to see if someone is attracted to you or just make a move and hope for the best.|`|FBGMKdqKaa	If you don't want the attention of the whole school, I would suggest meeting a potential girlfriend outside school and keeping it private.

Now if you don't believe your question is true, then no, I don't think there is a link between mental illness, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. <br>  <br>  According to the US Surgeon General: "Whether African Americans differ from whites in the rate of mental illness cannot be answered simply. For African Americans living in the community, overall rates of mental illness appear to be similar to those of non-Hispanic whites. Differences do arise when assessing the prevalence of specific illnesses." The same was found for Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders and Latinos/Hispanic Americans. No large-scale epidemiological studies of Native American Indians have been published, so they have no idea what their mental health needs and can't make comparisons to other cultures in the US. See the US Surgeon General fact sheets for each group here: <a href="http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/cre/factsheet.asp" rel="nofollow">http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/cre/facts...</a><br>  <br>  Now if you do think there is a link between mental illness and ethnicity, then whatever your ethnicity is, I agree, there could well be a link between mental illness and the particular ethnicity you are a part of. More information about your particular symptoms would be needed for a better diagnosis. I suggest discussing this matter with a therapist if it causes you discomfort.|`|zGcUxFzpaa	Afro-caribbeans are more likely to suffer from mental illness, usually due to the fact of racism at work and education.

syIp6d2Naa	Your going to have to work hard to keep a healthy relationship. It's not going to be easy, when I was in the service I was making plans for my partner and her three children to live close to the base and I would spend as much tie with them as I could, but by the time I was half way through my MOS I got a dear Jane letter. My partner just could not handle a relationship where I was not home every night. After the first shock wore off I realized she was just being honest. It might have worked as long as I was in the states but when I was going overseas she would never be able to handle it.  We remained friends and I still am a extra Aunt to the kids, who are all grown up and have families of their own. What your going to have to do is talk about it a lot, can you afford to move should she be stationed stateside and have the type of job that would be in demand in any area (ie. nursing or medical)? Are you going to be able to stand the stress of her being deployed into a combat zone? Do you have a good support structure to help on those days you haven't heard from her for a week or more? Remember it's still a don't ask, don't tell, you have to know there is always the chance letters can fall into hands that shouldn't see what is written and phone calls overheard. Now I don't mean to be insulting you but can you remain faithful for months, some people who have a high sex drive have problems, I'm not putting anyone down but it's one of those facts of life that has to be faced by military spouses male and female as well as the one in the service. They are in a life or death situation at times and the emotional reactions can put you in a really tough spot. I'm not saying it can't work but talk about all these things don't leave questions unasked, it's hard but you need to face all of this before it becomes an issue. Tell your partner that we all appreciate her serving and to know we'll be praying that she stays safe and that it works for the both of you.

Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|ZzWO4olgaa	go for a bungee jump.<br>  have sex in public.<br>  shoot a gun.<br>  get bladdered.<br>  <br>  there are so many things you can do that are fun/exciting/different.<br>  <br>  cheer up! it might never happen|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Not really -- I still haven't been able to answer satisfactorily the FIRST question you have to ask: IS there a point to living?|`|bVHnNqzBaa	If you have no excitement in your life, that is truly dismal.|`|XBI9ekydaa	So get out there and do something exciting!|`|rDxksI3naa	Live.

I hear Christians saying this, go look up John Hagee. He's big on the world ending.|`|Uac9AXmDaa	well that is not true, because bible says that their is 7 years of Antichrist, then 1,000 years on earth with Christ, then the end after that.|`|6PBgEf5eaa	Never Saintliest don't believe in such nonsense.
376ce902307f5e574ed98c7f99ccba8daa	You say that hearing people are ignorant and lack common sense, but your question is rather ignorant. I don't know sign language very well, but I know enough to communicate with deaf people. I'd be willing to communicate with a deaf person, which is why I started learning ASL in the first place.|`|AA10214265	I have to think that ignorance is the major culprit. There isn't a lot of interaction between the deaf community and the hearing community, so many hearing people have never been exposed to deaf people beyond Marlee Matlin or what they see on TV.<br>  <br>  I have met, interacted with, learned from, and dated deaf people. Communication is a challenge (especially since I don't fingerspell well, fast enough, nor do I read it well). I have witnessed other hearing people raise their voice to deaf people - as if they could hear better - or o.v.e.r   e.n.u.n.c.i.a.t.e and exaggerate their lip movement making lip reading impossible.<br>  <br>  The initial reaction most hearing people have to deaf people is due to a hyphenate: deaf-mute. They automatically presume that because a person is deaf that they cannot communicate, and certainly cannot vocalize. Since most hearing folks rarely get the opportunity to meet a deaf person, that perception lives unchallenged. Taken further, the assumed source of deafness is usually a birth defect or brain defect, leading many to assume that the deaf are mentally challenged. Guess they've never heard of Gallaudet University.<br>  <br>  I think in a lot of sociological ways, deaf people and gay people have something in common: both groups need to come out and educate the general public in order to combat stereotypes and promote understanding. Perhaps take that as your mission; to enlighten the hearing people you meet as to deaf culture.|`|po4j4xhAaa	My friend is completely deaf in her left ear and has 50% hearing loss in her right ear.  Her gf is profoundly deaf.  I have conversations with them whenever we hang out.  It's different from conversing with a hearing person, but it's not a big deal.<br>  And if you think I'm lying, you can go fornicate yourself; you're being as bigoted as you're accusing others of being.

0WMpafVnaa	Well, i chose both french and german for GCSE because i love languages. However, the choice is really down to a) which language you prefer b) which language you think you are more capable at and c) which language you feel you will be able to use more. Both languages are great to study at GCSE!|`|l4AW9OK4aa	i think french would be easier than german as i got an A* in GCSE french and my friend does GCSE german and she thinks its really hard....at the end of the day...do whichever one you like and are best at|`|AA12299134	If you are going to be a vet and do Scientific subjects, then French would be a better bet, because it descends from Latin, and so do a lot of medical terms.  One would compliment the other.<br>  <br>  However, ask yourself:<br>  <br>  *  Which language evokes nicer feelings for me?<br>  *  Which would I really be happier doing?<br>  *  The alarm goes off and you wake up each morning: which language would you REALLY rather be studying for 2 years of your life?<br>  *  And don't overlook the obvious:  which language do you find easier to study?|`|AA12286468	seems you're taking some hard subjects.<br>  <br>  base your decision on which language:<br>  <br>  you enjoy,<br>  you will use more frequently<br>  will take up less study time.<br>  <br>  based on those, i chose to take german, as i found it much easier grammatically to handle, and knew i would get a higher grade for it|`|YX8IUaRFaa	think wheter you will go to france or germany more often, i.e where ur most likely to go on holiday so u can use the language you learn. i choose german and loved it.|`|lhl1820iaa	I studied both subjects before i decided on my gcses. I found German was quite a lot easier to grasp with French being more challenging. So if your talented at languages i would recommend French more :).|`|AA11528369	french its easier|`|RuUawJ8Saa	There probably isn't much to choose between them given the options you've given. The only advantage I can see is that German would give you some, limited advantage in understanding Afrikaans as it has similarities with Dutch.<br>  <br>  Other than that, I would choose the one which appeals to you most. It won't be one of the options which determines your future career so you may as well pick the one you enjoy.|`|z5bKlsrxaa	Well i took german and got an E as an average in Year 10 and came out with an A* in August, Year 11. German is a lot easier than French, and you can get a very high grade within about 7 months of consistent hard work. Go for German!
06513454f057ec526caa7fcd77f5e44baa	Some phonetics might help: "ch" and "j" are really two sounds each. Ch = 't' + 'sh' and j = 'd' + 'zh' (the same as ch only using your vocal cords).<br>  <br>  If you can say 's' just move your tongue a little farther back  (and flatten it against your upper mouth) to get the 'sh' sound; do the same to go from 'z' to 'zh'. If you haven't guessed already, the only difference between s/z and sh/zh is whether they are voiced or not.<br>  <br>  The English "soft g" is not related at all to the "hard g" however! G before 'e' or 'i' is usually the same sound as 'j' (a voiced 'ch').<br>  <br>  T/d is another unvoiced/voiced pair which use the same tongue position as s/z. The difference is that t/s are "stops" and s/z are called sibilants or hissing sounds. When you say ch or j start with your tongue in the t/d position and flip the tip downwards while keeping your tongue against the roof of your mouth. Whe you do this your breath can escape and you will be making the sh/zh sounds.|`|pE23QDDFaa	you can't really explain it through writing.my advice is for you to ask someone trustworthy to spend some hours with you and practice.why don't you ask your relatives or your best friend?<br>  anyway,don't worry much about it.the more stressed you are over it the harder it'll be for you to deliver your speech correctly.so just take it easy!good luck!|`|I1ZAEmLsaa	go on youtube.|`|01NUrwfYaa	I'm sure you've heard the sound before, but you can't reproduce it, right?<br>  <br>  well:::<br>  <br>  sh ... pretend to shsh (tell them to be quiet by making a grunt) someone.

Growth and healing is a process.<br>  <br>   I had to seek situations that helped me to feel comfortable. And sometime this mean for me to change friends and even environment. I learned that it is not good to hold on to the old just because there were a few good memories/experiences.<br>  <br>   It was best for me to accept myself and others by respecting bounderies and letting go of fears. "Nothing to fear but fear its self" I found to be a true statement and the most important thing I have learned on my life's journey is that to grow is to know and education is a process that happen mostly outside of the classroom. <br>  <br>  Understaning your life and where you want to be is the key. Suicide is not the answer, I know I have tried it more than twice and I am still here, now by choice I choose to live. I learned to adjust my mirror to see me, my self for who I am. <br>  <br>  Loving myself, accepting myself, and learning to be alone with myself is the best thing that has happened to me and within that I have not found a mate however I have found myself and some nice peer to share a moment in time with. <br>  <br>  Best wishes Ms. T

However, verse 2 tells us that Cornelius was "A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway." But...he was a Gentile, not a Jew - not even a Samaritan! Keep in mind, up to this point salvation had been only extended by the Apostles to Jews on the Day of Pentecost in Acts 2 (see notes), and then to the mixed-blood Jews, the Samaritans, in Acts 8 (see notes). Nonetheless, the prayer of Cornelius goes up as a "memorial before God" in verse 4.|`|k3LbhASGaa	the  ninth hour is nine o clock  in the morning, Cornelius prayer vision is God honoring a man who is devoted to the right God and God simply sending his angel to tell him what to do and who to talk with ( peter) It is the beginning of God`s plan to bring in the believing gentiles to the faith in Jesus Christ . In the begining it was only the hebrew people who believed , now God was going to send peter to the gentiles who will believe in  Jesus .

fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	The term "rapture", and most of the popular ideas associated with it, arose out of the dispensational and millenarian (Adventist) movements of the mid to latter 19th century. That suggests that the idea of a "rapture," especially the idea of a "secret" rapture, is far more historically and culturally conditioned then it is a biblical or theological truth. The biblical references, that are most used to support a rapture do not clearly support the idea at all. They all firmly support a "second coming" (whatever form that might take), a Resurrection, and a Judgment, all without giving any solid details about any of them.<br>  <br>  I think the biblical, answer is, we do not know. We do know "That our Lord will return, the dead will be raised, and the final judgment will take place." I'm perfectly happy with that.<br>  <br>  "I kept them, Father, all but the one, the son of perdition..." That's quite a title given to Judas Iscariot. Another time we read the same title is given to the Anti-Christ; he is called the son of perdition. There are some who believe that Judas Iscariot will be the Anti-Christ.|`|0fd6c9cd983b835b83ca7be549d67540aa	John 17:20 is saying whom God has chosen, they are following Him. there are other scriptures that say the same thing bout "only the ones chosen can come to Him." im not really sure how to take the scriptures like these cuz of the scriptures that say "God loved the world not wanting anyone to perish"  as far as the rapture, if your saved you'll be taken up otherwise you'll be left behind during tribulation.|`|Txg9UpBOaa	woo the pros are that if u ahve a really good intimate relationship wit god he is goin to take u with him to heaven and if u dont then u suffer the consecuences of not believing in him or gettin to noe wat he is all about .......<br>   <br>  the cons are that well if u dnt have a relationship or friendship with him u r goin to suffer here.... he is goin to leave behind those kinda ppl<br>  <br>  and i say suffer because woo ther is goin to be alot of that ..........<br>  <br>  hahaaaa  GOODLUCK|`|k7973dtIaa	First...it's not a theory it is a revelation of truth/fact..Some choose to believe and some do not.<br>  <br>  Secondly...for those who follow Christ, the rapture means going to heaven, which is "home" to be with God forever.<br>  <br>  Those who do not follow Christ, the rapture signifies a time when God will remove Himself from earth, by removing His body (of believers) from it.  This will mean that evil will have free reign,with nothing to keep it in check.  Basically hell on earth for those that are left behind (for seven years).  <br>  <br>  Christ comes back (after the 7 years) to establish Himself as King of Kings.  He will rule the earth for 1000 years....at that time He defeats all of His enemies....<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|n1sxDwvgaa	The only "con" to the rapture is if you don't the Lord Jesus as Savior. <br>  John 17:12  simplifying it means that all who trust Jesus as Lord will be saved.

be059bdf4ef4d8d4f864f42d17a8e06eaa	I'm not liking the other answers.  <br>  <br>  I live in Pennsylvania...not quite as north, but like today its below freezing......in the summer (when we get the 17 hour days) its going to be in the high 80's...some 90's...and some 100's.   I'm not saying its easy in the middle east....but we are not accustomed to those temps....next month when it hits the 40's...my friends will go skiing in shorts.......people here start dieing when it hits 85.  <br>  <br>  Also, if you figure...18 hours of fasting...then isha is 1 hr later....if you are going to pray taraweeh....tack on 90 minutes for prayer and transportation....then 30 minutes to get to sleep........you have 3 hours until fajr......and yeah you can sleep a little bit, but you're not suppose to sleep through the majority of day....breaks the whole point of fasting.    I know plenty of people who left the middle east because they said soo many people do that and those people think its ok......not the "only" reason..but one of them. <br>  <br>  Now they still do have to fast...but obviously if it becomes an issue of health....they can make up the day .....and i got mixed messages about giving money to the poor....some told me..if normally you could fast, but get sick...you can't give money to the poor...have to make up the day....other said you can.  <br>  <br>  Most people here during the summer.....they basically try as much as they can, but after a few days...they just fast every other day....then make up the remaining.   Its a mix of the heat and the longevity of the day.....can't do it day after day after day.    Plus islam is "easy".|`|AA10248239	Yes, they do, but some take time off from work.

tlpo8dTKaa	Guns, germs, and steel. There's a book by this title, but it really is an adequate answer to your question.<br>  <br>  The Spanish had guns. Not very *good* guns, but they had guns nonetheless. Imagine being an Aztec and seeing a shiny stick explode with smoke and fiery sparks. It'd be terrifying, and easy to mistake as "divine". <br>  <br>  The Spanish had swords and other such weapons and armour. The natives' weapons just couldn't stand up to the superior steel of the Conquistadors.<br>  <br>  The Spanish brought all their nasty germs with them. While the Spaniards had been exposed to smallpox and other such diseases all their lives, the natives (being on a totally different continent for thousands of years), had *never* been exposed to those European diseases, and therefore had absolutely no immunities built up to fight them. I think the number is somewhere between 80 and 90% of the native population that was totally wiped out within a century. Mostly because of disease. And it's because of this that the Spanish started importing west Africans into the New World for slave labour. It's because the natives were dropping like flies. And the Africans were pretty much immune (well, this is really one of many reasons why those filthy pigs captured and enslaved all those Africans).<br>  <br>  Hope this helped. : )|`|khdFNlJ7aa	Because the Natives of the land thought they were Gods  and let them into their society only to be enslaved and conquered.|`|LDVBKMiSaa	indians from india?<br>  <br>  please be more specific?<br>  <br>  oh and btw, they did that to PERU natives|`|OOP6Hesyaa	The vast majority of Indians died of diseases brought to the land.

You just send the card back and check off 'will not attend'.<br>  <br>  If you have ALREADY told the person that you will be attending, and now you've changed your mind, it gets a little bit stickier.   If the wedding is like this weekend and you decided not go to, then it is fairly rude to not go because most likely the bride and groom have already given a final number to the venue and have paid for your meal.  In this case, you need a GOOD excuse (like a real one, not something made up) and you need to personally call either the bride and groom and tell them what happened.   <br>  <br>  The only one that I think will not piss off the couple is "I am too sick".|`|ee2eb688bade7663b57e940f752dc454aa	You don't need an excuse.<br>  And, for heaven's sake, don't lie!

Ga7rI488aa	No, if you withhold it, it is like a grudge. I'm Christian, so forgiveness is one of the most significant elements in a person to me. Even in extreme cases such as murder, rape, etc. Though I, thankfully, have never been put in that position. But I have a somewhat different perspective on forgiveness.  Forgiveness is the key to setting free all negative energy, as lame as that sounds. You know how they say forgive and forget? I forgive that person, then depending on the situation, I either forget what happened or just try to forget about them. Why I try to forget about that person is because if I can only remember them for the bad thing that happened, it's best to let them go. Hope that helps! If you need me to discuss this stuff further with you, let me know!|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Nope.  Withholding is a form of punishment.  You haven't forgiven if you're still angry and punishing the person.  You've forgiven when you have let it go of the anger entirely.

God's plan was to create a being that would fill the empty ranks of the fallen.  The history of the earth is a script being played out according the eternal purpose of God.  <br>  <br>  We are a creature that is made to live by faith, not knowledge, and Jesus showed us that through faith we are brought back to God.  "My righteousness one shall live by faith"|`|aPuj6xoHaa	To serve, worship, honor and glorify God!<br>  <br>  God did not create the earth evil.  <br>  <br>  Yes, God's creation is absolutely beautiful and magnificent!|`|EmyMvE3Vaa	Don't u christians ever get out? Google monty python, they explain the whole thing from the christian perspective|`|7GAqoFUWaa	World is great, huge, complex and wonderful. In all these it is like as if it was designed by someone intelligent - as Christians believe it really was. But it has also many dangers and often causes suffering to people. <br>  <br>  The world is dangerous and challenging. I can hardly imagine how it could be not like that still reserving its complete freedom. Because not only people are free, but also powers and things of the world. <br>  <br>  I do not know who Adam and Eve was, whether they were some real people, although in a symbolic tale (as some theologians think), or never really lived and are just symbols of humankind (as some other theologians think). But I am sure that their story has one relevant meaning. They simbolize us, each of us, personally. Their story might be about the past of humankind, too, but it surely is about its actual present. <br>  <br>  We, each era's humans are the ones, who often try to be like God - but a selfish God, omnipotent, but not compassionate and not self-sacrificing. Humans are the ones, who might live in unselfish love, so in a loving community with God, but (often) more trust in lies of the Evil One (thoughts of selfishness, haughtiness or hatred). Humans are the ones, who lose the paradise of love and peace of faith, of community with God because of lack of trust in loving, so in God and because of disobedience to the calling to really love. But I do not mean paradise only in a moral or mental way.<br>  <br>  It is a Christian experience that not only our social or mental world works better, when we live our lives along Christian values, but that even physical world might work otherways, than usual. I have personally experienced real miracles (eg. miraculous healing, justified prophecy), just like many other Christians have. So when we live in a strong, personal, living community with God - by believing in Christ -, we can experience something from the things of the coming world.  <br>  <br>  The paradise is living in justice, living in real, unselfish love and so being in unity, in community with God. The paradise is a state where even things of the physical world work well. People usually seem to have not enough wisdom and will to really love each other and so they are not in community with God, and so they do not live in paradise. In their unloving, distorted state they experience a world lacking God, a distorted world. We experience now a creation not yet ready, but a creation that is in motion and one distorted by our sins. <br>  <br>  Jesus Christ's example and teaching and a personal community with Him in prayer and trust might help us to live in love, in community with God, so essentially to live in paradise. Jesus is also called the New Adam - the true Adam, a founder of a New Mankind. Because his love towards God and people and his faithfulness in this mean that mentality Adam and Eve - and so each of us - are created for. This spirituality, the unity with God is the source of his miracles and his rising from death. And Jesus said - after miraculously healing someone -that "my Father never stops working. And so I work too." (John 5, 17) So this means the creation continuously happens - a renewed creation, a droplet from the Complete One, not distorted by sin - where Jesus is present. He might be present through our soul, our person in this world or not, it depends on us.<br>  <br>  We are not yet complete as far as our lives on earth hasn't ended. God creates us just now, but giving us freedom at the same time. So we might co-create ourselves together with God, throughout our good deeds of love, if we live a really Christian, saintly life in unity with Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  We can have some experience of God's coming world now. But we will experience the New Heaven and New Earth, so a renewed nature after the last judgement. Then everyone, who lived as a real human person, so as a human person, who lived fully God's calling to love will experience fully the new world, the new creation. Freedom will be compatible of everything being good there, because only loving people go there, and then they will be in complete unity with God, who is love. And so then the new, real and complete nature will be in harmony with them and will serve them.<br>  <br>  But in this world now everyone has sins or tends to have sins, and is not in unity spiritually, ethically with God. This world is in an incomplete state, an undecided state, perhaps one can call it a pending creation. We co-create ourselves, but also co-create nature together with God - throughout intelligent, good work and even miracles. This whole process will be complete after the Last Judgment. Where there is no real, unselfish love - and that is generally the case in connection with most of mankind -, there nature is in an incomplete or distorted state and that causes suffering. <br>  <br>  We believe that God will judge everyone justly and mercifully. Each human person might have a basic decision or direction of will towards God and so towards love or not. This decision or directi|`|whM7DOy9aa	Thought you would enjoy this chapter out of the book "What Does the Bible Really Teach?". USE YOUR BIBLE while reading the following. For more great biblical answers go to www.watchtower.org. They even offer a FREE HOME BIBLE STUDY IN YOUR AREA!<br>  <br>  Chapter Three<br>  <br>  What Is God’s Purpose for the Earth?<br>  <br>  What is God’s purpose for mankind?<br>  <br>  How has God been challenged?<br>  <br>  What will life on earth be like in the future?<br>  <br>  GOD’S purpose for the earth is really wonderful. Jehovah wants the earth to be filled with happy, healthy people. The Bible says that “God planted a garden in Eden” and that he “made to grow .?.?. every tree desirable to one’s sight and good for food.” After God created the first man and woman, Adam and Eve, He put them in that lovely home and told them: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it.” (Genesis 1:28; 2:8, 9,?15) So it was God’s purpose that humans have children, extend the boundaries of that garden home earth wide, and take care of the animals.<br>  <br>  2 Do you think that Jehovah God’s purpose for people to live in an earthly paradise will ever be realized? “I have even spoken it,” God declares, “I shall also do it.” (Isaiah 46:9-11; 55:11) Yes, what God purposes he will surely do! He says that he “did not create [the earth] simply for nothing” but “formed it even to be inhabited.” (Isaiah 45:18) What kind of people did God want to live on the earth? And for how long did he want them to live here? The Bible answers: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.”—Psalm 37:29; Revelation 21:3,?4.<br>  <br>  3 Obviously, this has not happened yet. People now get sick and die; they even fight and kill one another. Something went wrong. Surely, however, God did not purpose that the earth should be as we see it today! What happened? Why has God’s purpose not been fulfilled? No history book written by man can tell us because the trouble started in heaven.<br>  <br>  THE ORIGIN OF AN ENEMY<br>  <br>  4 The first book of the Bible tells of an opposer of God who showed up in the garden of Eden. He is described as “the serpent,” but he was not a mere animal. The last book of the Bible identifies him as “the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth.” He is also called “the original serpent.” (Genesis 3:1; Revelation 12:9) This powerful angel, or invisible spirit creature, used a serpent to speak to Eve, even as a skilled person can make it seem that his voice is coming from a nearby doll or dummy. That spirit person had no doubt been present when God prepared the earth for humans.—Job 38:4,?7.<br>  <br>  5 Since all of Jehovah’s creations are perfect, however, who made this “Devil,” this “Satan”? Put simply, one of the powerful spirit sons of God turned himself into the Devil. How was this possible? Well, today a person who was once decent and honest may become a thief. How does that happen? The person may allow a wrong desire to develop in his heart. If he keeps thinking about it, that wrong desire may become very strong. Then if the opportunity presents itself, he may act upon the bad desire that he has been thinking about.—James 1:13-15.<br>  <br>  6 This happened in the case of Satan the Devil. He apparently heard God tell Adam and Eve to have children and to fill the earth with their offspring. (Genesis 1:27,?28) ‘Why, all these humans could worship me rather than God!’ Satan evidently thought. So a wrong desire built up in his heart. Eventually, he took action to deceive Eve by telling her lies about God. (Genesis 3:1-5) He thus became a “Devil,” which means “Slanderer.” At the same time, he became “Satan,” which means “Opposer.”<br>  <br>  7 By using lies and trickery, Satan the Devil caused Adam and Eve to disobey God. (Genesis 2:17; 3:6) As a result, they eventually died, as God had said they would if they disobeyed. (Genesis 3:17-19) Since Adam became imperfect when he sinned, all his offspring inherited sin from him. (Romans 5:12) The situation might be illustrated with a pan used for baking bread. If the pan has a dent in it, what happens to each loaf of bread made in the pan? Each loaf has a dent, or an imperfection, in it. Similarly, each human has inherited a “dent” of imperfection from Adam. That is why all humans grow old and die.—Romans 3:23.<br>  <br>  8 When Satan led Adam and Eve into sinning against God, he was really leading a rebellion. He was challenging Jehovah’s way of ruling. In effect, Satan was saying: ‘God is a bad ruler. He tells lies and holds back good things from his subjects. Humans do not need to have God ruling over them. They can decide for themselves what is good and what is bad. And they will be better off under my rulership.’ How would God handle such an insulting challenge? Some think that God should simply have put the rebels to death. But would that have answered Satan’s challenge? Would it have proved that God’s way of ruling is right?<br>  <br>  9 Jehovah’s perfect sense of justice would not allow him to put the rebels|`|wP1pgUKVaa	It is a chance for us to spread the good news and for our enjoyment!

J97kVSJ4aa	If you study true Buddhism my friend you will understand that these temples and these donations are a human organized problem.  Buddhism in its pure sense has nothing to do with fancy temples or idols or anything material for that matter.  You do not have to come to any temples to meditate and you do not have to be in the company of anyone else.<br>  <br>  Human 'organized' religion is largely to blame for what you are speaking of... not Buddhism itself.|`|52gVSg9jaa	Buddhism is not at fault here.<br>  Open your eyes and you will see.<br>  Give unto Ceaser.<br>  Follow the money.<br>  Who pays for the shrine?<br>  Who does the work to build the shrine?<br>  Who sells the materials to the people who build the shrine?<br>  Who owns the land?<br>  Who ......<br>  You get the idea now don't you?|`|cCd8L2PGaa	Buddhism is even rational to atheists.<br>  <br>  It's actually very intelligent in many ways.  Profound wisdom, that is all I can say.|`|8Hj9oxVDaa	Buddhism is NOT A RELIGION. It is a philosophy and a way of life.|`|4LeHbW2raa	I think what you want to know is why people who so gleefully put Christians and Muslims down don't behave with Buddhists in the same way. It is because of the difference in the natures of these religions and their histories . Buddhism unlike the other two does not condemn the rest of the world to spending eternity in hell . It also does not have a history of prosecuting other faiths. It offers each person a way to lessen the suffering ,i am sure,  almost everyone has to face at some point of time in their lives. It does not insist that people follow its path nor does it condemn those who don't . What it does is provide solace and hope to people and leads them towards a gentler and simpler life . What is wrong with that ? <br>   You rightly point out that temples need not become too showy and that the money spent on them might be better utilized in building hospitals,schools etc. How is Buddhism to blame for all this ? I am sure the Buddha himself would have agreed with you . This is a person who gave his kingdom and went in search of truth. The problem here , as with most other religions , is that the custodians of the religion have forgotten their roots. They have become ensnared by the same desires that their religion so explicitly warns against. <br>    Why does religion have to be certified by " rational thought" . Belief is not driven by rationality , it is usually arrived at through experience . Some people's life are changed for the better because of their belief in God. Their stories would not have been possible without their faith and they know it . No amount of rational explanation can weaken their belief . What is so horrible about that ?<br>    Rationalists need do only one thing to make people believe that rational thought is the real deal . They should be able to explain reality with all its intricacies to the people and tell them how it relates to their lives . Unless they can do that people will continue to believe in God/religion.<br>    The Dhammapada says  "Hatred can never overcome hatred , Neither great wars nor revenge , It is only love , Pure and sublime , That can overcome hatred " . Why do you consider such sayings obsolete ?|`|Kf2JUEPVaa	Buddhism does not (directly, at least) address the same problems as hospitals and roads, etc., but it does, IMHO, address real and important problems and definitely helps with them, and can solve them permanently.<br>  <br>  Denying the importance of Buddhism would be like denying the importance of safer roads because they don't solve the same problems as the hospitals do.<br>  <br>  Having said that, I DO think money should go to translating and printing Buddhist books, supporting monks, lamas and teachers, and sending them on tour to speak to the public- NOT to big, gold-plated Temples.  THAT money would definitely be better spent on roads, hospitals and healthier food.<br>  <br>  IMHO, of course!|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	You ask us to remain polite and yet freely state that Christianity, Islam are destructive and against science, progress and rational.  I will not give the horrors committed in their name a free pass, but you must realize that society as a whole owes a large debt to the Church as a whole for bringing us out of the dark ages and the beginning of the Renaissance.  As much as science was held back by the Church more has been done to progress said science until it became a religion unto it's own.  <br>  <br>  Now to address your problem of Temples, Churches and other religious buildings.  I cannot argue, but most of the three you are against (you did not mention Judaism, but it would be one too) each build their structures with the funds of the devout.  This was not always so, but it was also a different time too and I am sure it saddens God to see the waste when a simple structure would suffice.  He did live in a tent after all.<br>  <br>  But, how about the waste of Government funds on stupid studies?  I read a recent Reader's Digest article about science projects.  One I remember was a study on whether fleas jump higher on Dogs vs. Cats!  Really how will that help humanity?  I am sure if we did away with this and more elaborate structures we could help the poor and down trodden.  But, that is socialism and it does not work with sinful man.<br>  <br>  Final thought.  If you are not a man of faith why bother with the poor?  Just take care of yourself and all is well...right?|`|IIhiSprlaa	Rant.

We do this by our thoughts words and actions. Thoughts, words and actions are energy and we have the power to create whatever it is around us, whether we think we are doing it or not. This energy we produce by thoughts, words and actions "clumps together" with like energy. If the most energy is negative, (by anger, uncaring, intolerance etc) we produce (create) negative things (suffering etc). If the most energy is positive (by LOVE and compassion and help etc), it produces positive things (such as peace, LOVE, and abundance).<br>  <br>  Nothing "happens" to us, we create it all. It is like a stage play where we are the producers. The important thing is to understand that, and just be in the audience, realising that we have created what we are watching.<br>  <br>  BUT, we can change that reality (if we choose to).

uUCTem2Eaa	"Social Darwinism" is a principle Darwin himself rejected. (He personally requested his name be removed from the term. It's more in keeping with Spencer's feelings, which is why many will call it "Spencerism".)<br>  <br>  The problem with "Social Darwinism" is that it assigns value judgments to what is meant to be an objective observation of natural phenomena. In other words, Darwin's Theory of Evolution was only intended to be DESCRIPTIVE, that is, to describe exactly what happens. Spencerism is PRESCRIPTIVE, that is, it tries to say how things SHOULD be or SHOULDN'T be. There is no "prescriptive" science. Science merely explains, but does not judge or evaluate, the physical world.|`|283tO9j9aa	They're different things- Social Darwinism kind of implies that there is some kind of aim to evolution when there isn't any long term goal for 'improvement' like there is in society.

In criminal justice, these experts denied the existence of free will and proposed replacing punishment with invasive “cures” such as the lobotomy. In welfare, they proposed eliminating the poor by sterilizing those deemed biologically unfit. In business, they urged the selection of workers based on racist theories of human evolution and the development of advertising methods to more effectively manipulate consumer behavior. In sex education, they advocated creating a new sexual morality based on “normal mammalian behavior” without regard to longstanding ethical and religious imperatives.

HBp5r76haa	Absolutely not!<br>  <br>  The responses to the altar call that a preacher or an evangelist may give at the end of their sermon can derive from a number of factors:<br>  <br>  (1) true repentance of one's sinful ways upon understanding of what Jesus Christ's death really meant and upon appreciation of His great Love. Such understanding is supernatural and the work of the Holy Spirit, as by logical standards the Gospel makes no sense. Why would God die for man?<br>  <br>  (2) emotions. It is almost impossible to listen to what Jesus did for mankind and be not moved by the message. But if the heart has not been moved by the Holy Spirit and repentance did not kick in, those emotions will not last.<br>  <br>  (3) remorse. A sincere sorrow for our ways of life may come upon listening to the message, but no supernatural work of the Holy Ghost in this.<br>  <br>  Only those who say the sinner prayer upon the motivations in (1) will be saved. And by that I mean: they will be indwelt with the Holy Spirit who will start a work in them and will not finish it until the end.<br>  This supernatural work will be evident in their changed life, in their continuous attitude of repentance and in their submission to God's will. In other words, they will be "blessed" (see Matthew 5)<br>  <br>  One of my favorite preachers say: "people are not saved because of the sinner prayer, but some are saved by the Holy Spirit in spite of the sinner prayer".<br>  <br>  By this I do not mean that we need works in order to be saved by works!|`|wuPTBIIuaa	being born again, <br>  has two simple definitions: of water and of spirit. <br>  <br>  those that are not born of spirit, do not really understand what it means.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	That's the problem with just praying the "sinner's prayer". Many people do this and then continue living in sin as they always have. There has been no inward change of heart. They believe that if they just say this prayer, they'll be saved and they can go on living just like your average atheist. It doesn't work that way. Christ tells us we must "take up our cross daily" and follow Him.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	No.<br>  <br>  Many preachers and evangelists today teach that we must pray the sinners prayer and accept Christ into our heart as our Lord and Savior. A preacher once told me that nearly all preachers teach the sinners prayer. I suppose he thinks that just because nearly all teach it, that this makes it right. I agree with him that "many", if not nearly all, do teach it. It makes sense as well that they do because Jesus did say that "many" will follow the "broad" path to destruction. Yes "many" will follow what the majority follows. Jesus even tells us why... partly because of false teachers. (Matthew 7:13-15)<br>  <br>  Many teach that at the time of the sinners prayer, we are forgiven of our sins (washed of our sins)... and that baptism (which is when our sins are actually washed away) is obedience after we are saved.<br>  <br>  In spite of all the Scriptural evidence we have before us they still choose to deny Christ.<br>  <br>  They believe baptism is an outward sign of an inward change. Ironically, this concept is nowhere to be found in the Bible. It is a man-made philosophical viewpoint with no Scriptural proof whatsoever.<br>  <br>  The truth is that the sinners prayer is not once mentioned in the Bible... it is fabricated by men.<br>  <br>  The truth is that the Bible teaches that baptism is when our sins are washed away and we are forgiven unto salvation... not prayer.<br>  <br>  Yes, we do pray for forgiveness of sins when we sin after we are saved (1 John 1:9) and God is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins. However, God does not respond to the prayer of an unsaved sinner...<br>  John 9:31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.<br>  <br>  Jesus said "If ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you"... we must be "in Christ" to "ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you."...<br>  <br>  John 15:7 "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you."<br>  <br>  If we must be "in Christ" for Him to give us what we ask for, then there is no way an unsaved sinner can ask and receive salvation through prayer, because an unsaved sinner is not "in Christ"... he is out of Christ until he is "baptized into Christ". There is no instruction nor any example of anyone being able to get "in Christ" by prayer... the Bible clearly teaches that the only way to get "in Christ" is to be "baptized into Christ"...<br>  <br>  Romans 6:3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.<br>  <br>  Galatians 3:27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.<br>  <br>  Colossians 2:12 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.<br>  <br>  If there is another way for someone to get "in Christ" then God forgot to inspires someone to write it in His Word.<br>  <br>  Jesus nor any of the apostles ever taught or wrote that we must pray to be saved.<br>  <br>  God only hears those who worship Him and do His will.<br>  <br>  A prayer similar to the "sinners prayer" was first started around 500 years ago. The actual "sinners prayer" started in the Billy Sunday era (he died around 1935) and was later formalized during Billy Graham's ministry.<br>  <br>  Understand that no one in the Bible, not the first person, ever prayed the sinners prayer to be saved.|`|c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	Sad but true...many have been led into believing that a prayer will save them.  This is a false teaching...that a prayer rather than "trusting" Christ can provide salvation.<br>  Saying the sinner's prayer is simply a way of declaring to God that you are relying on Jesus Christ as your Savior. There are no "magical" words that result in salvation. It is only faith in Jesus' death and resurrection that can save us.<br>  <br>  Saying the sinners prayer without genuine trust is called "easy believism."  We have an R & S regular here who is pushing this false teaching.|`|lJUyhMceaa	You are absolutely right.  There is no place in the Bible thats says "pray unto Jesus and you shall be saved"...or anything like that.<br>  <br>  It does however say, "believe", "call upon",  "believe upon", and "call".<br>  <br>  I do believe that a person who truly trust Christ as Saviour will want to pray and thank Him for dying for them and making salvation possible.  And any person who is saved will want to pray to God regularly, But, as you pointed out, the prayer does not save anyone.<br>  <br>  And in answer to your question.... NO, not everyone that prays is saved.  There are many who have said a prayer from their head, but never really meant it in their heart.  I was one of them for many years.<br>  <br>  This is why God tells us in other Scripture that if anyone is truly saved, they are a new person, old things are passed away, and everything has become new. (paraphrased).<br>  <br>  He also says that true salvation is being born again.  Not of the flesh, but born again of the spirit.  So, if a person is truly saved, they will know it without any shadow of doubt, and Godly people around them will know it also.<br>  <br>  God further tells us that His spirit will testify to our spirit that we are His child.<br>  <br>  So, my question to anyone reading this is, "since you "got saved", have you became a new person?  Have you became born again, not in flesh, but in the spirit? And, Has God's Spirit testified to your spirit that you are His Child?  if yes, then praise the Lord.  If not, maybe you should reevaluate where you stand.|`|hvNqywbBaa	I don't know the sinners prayer.<br>  <br>  I'm Catholic.......and a true Christian.<br>  <br>  As far as salvation:<br>  <br>  I Have Been Saved (past event) <br>  I Am Being Saved (present event) <br>  I Will Be Saved (future event) <br>  I Save (by participating in Christ's salvific work)|`|6f0e45a91719820a0d453b3ba6acce13aa	Good points you have made, and you are not the only one to have noticed this.<br>  I would point out that there is no "incantation" or specific words. And, the very popular "Have you heard of the four spiritual laws?" tract that has been used for a couple of decades now misses something- REPENTANCE...<br>  Yup. Many are into the cheap grace, or the easy-believism, whatever you want to call it...they repeat the words, and go on their way, thinking that because they have mouthed the "right" words, God is now on "their" side.<br>  This we can count on though: that they have come to that point of praying, it is God that is calling them...natural man does not choose this unless God so moves them...growth should start. A seed may be poorly planted, but it does have the chance to grow.|`|AA11989753	The only thing that we need to repent of to be saved is our unbelief.  Do we have to realize our sinful condition to be saved?  Of course, yes!  But there is not one verse in the entire Bible which requires a person to forsake sin to be saved.  Nor does the Bible give anyone a license to sin.  Every time Jesus forgave someone and healed them, it was AFTERWARDS that He said... go and sin no more.  John 5:14, "Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee."  Thus, we don't give up our sins to become a Christian; no, rather, we forsake our sins because we are a Christian.  There are no prerequisites or conditions for salvation.  God will save any guilty sinner who trusts upon Jesus Christ for salvation. <br>  <br>  I do NOT believe it is inappropriate to apply the parable of the prodigal son to the unsaved who need to come back to their Creator, but technically the Parable is about a believer, a "son."  The parable about the prodigal son applies to the wayward believer who is in need of repentance from sins.   The repentance unto salvation is a ONE-TIME repentance, but the repentance from sins has no limit.  Christians are people, and people are sinners.  Just as a man cannot be UNBORN physically, neither can he be unborn spiritually.  Once saved, always saved!  For anyone to teach otherwise is to add works to faith alone and corrupt "the simplicity that is in Christ" (2nd Corinthians 11:3,4).  <br>  <br>  Once a person is saved, they begin to grow in grace by feeding on the Truth of God's Word (1st Peter 2:2).  As a believer grows in the Truth, he or she realizes that there are changes in their life that need to be made.  God's Holy Spirit works in that person's heart.  Thus, we begin to see the FRUIT of genuine repentance.  A changed life is the FRUIT of genuine repentance; and NOT a prerequisite to salvation or a part of saving-faith.  Proponents of Lordship Salvation place the cart before the horse and have it all backwards.  The change comes as a result of true repentance; not as a means to it. <br>  <br>  In Mark 1:4, John the Baptist speaks of "...repentance for the remission of sins"; NOT "repentance of sins."  Acts 20:21 reads... "Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ."  Notice that Biblical repentance is TOWARD God.  In Acts 11:21 we read, "And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord."  This is Biblical repentance... turning to the Lord. To turn towards Jesus Christ in faith for salvation is to turn one's back against sin, even though the person may not be willing to forsake sin at the time of salvation.  It is ludicrous for anyone to teach that a lost sinner must give up their sins to be saved.  As we saw with Lot and Samson in the Old Testament, not all believers live for God.<br>  <br>  In the Gospel of John, the word "believe" is mentioned 85-times; but the word "repent" is never mentioned even once.  This clearly evidences that the sinner who believes on the Lord for salvation has also repented.  Repentance and faith are inseparable.  You can't turn to the Savior for forgiveness of sins without turning your back against sin (not the literal forsaking of the act of sin; but a realization of one's having violated God's holy Law and deserved punishment in Hellfire).<br>  <br>  Consider the following quote by the mighty man of God, Dr. Harry Ironside (1876-1951)...<br>  <br>  "Repentance is the recognition of my sinnership — the owning before God that I am as vile as He has declared me to be in His holy Word."<br>  <br>  <br>  This is vastly different than actually ceasing from one's sin to be saved, which is a false gospel.  Pastor Ironside is correct — repentance is simply realizing that one is a guilty, dirty, rotten, hopeless sinner in God's eyes.  This is why we need a Savior.  Thankfully, Jesus paid the price with His own literal precious blood (1st Peter 1:18,19; Hebrews 9:12). <br>   <br>  <br>  The Change Comes AFTER a Person is Saved, NOT before<br>  <br>  The internet is plagued with heretics who are teaching that a person must forsake their sinful life to be saved.  2nd Corinthians 5:17 reads, "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."  Please notice that a man does NOT become a "new creature" until AFTER he is in Christ (saved).  The change comes after a person is saved; NOT before, but AFTER.  If a person claims to be a Christian but is living a wicked life, then I would sincerely doubt that person's salvation as well.  However, I am not going to start teaching damnable heresy by saying that sinners must forsake their sins to be saved.  Salvation comes through childlike faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, nothing may be added.  Once a man becomes a new creature in Christ, then he begins to change.|`|3m00lxxuaa	No, not everyone.

No loss of their two sons, one to murder, one to exile. They could have daily spoken with Jehovah and never known the astrangement and loss of their relationship with Jehovah. They could be here today, to see generations after generations of their children and grandchildren worship Jehovah, and be proud that they had remained faithful in order to see it. Women would be grateful to Eve, and she would be regarded as our collective mother. Men would imitate Adams example of faithfulness and headship, As it is, we have them to blame for suffering, old age and death. Jehovah had to send Jesus, at great cost, to redeem mankind from Adams' sin. We have to live in a ruined earth, and watch our loved ones die, and await the resurrection. Men lord it over women, and women suffer in childbirth, and resent the headship their husbands should provide. We have to wait for the end of this old system, wait for Jehovah to set everything right again, and sometimes it seems such a long time coming, even tho we know it won't be late. People now think it sounds like such a fairy tale, not even believable, but you have to have faith in ALL of Jehovahs words, and He didn't tell us about Adam and Eve just to fill the book of Genesis. It was true.
DfDss68haa	Yeah, doesn't that suck? I had one store attendant completely ignore me and my mom. We never went back. Oh and don't go to Denny's. Not only is their food disgusting but they have a long history of racism. They refused to wait on me and my family once. They got caught for doing "black outs". They would turn off the lights and pretend the store was closed when black customers walked up. Why? People pick and choose.

How would you know he was staring at you, if you weren't staring at him? Or maybe he thought you were cute. Or maybe he is a racist, either way, it doesn't help to jump to conclusions.<br>  <br>  With all the thumbs down, I guess it's obvious, it's just easier to assume he was racist then to apply some thought to it.|`|7sEFufRbaa	Unfortunately that is because it is usually mainly blacks stealing from Department stores.

She is alive and recovering at UPMC.    <br>  <br>  I know not all black people are bad but depending on where you live things can be different..<br>  <br>  In addition, I am so tired of hearing how the black man is held down all the time, as if the world owes them.    I am not responsible for what happened to your great great great great great grandparents.   Surely what they went through would they really be please and/or prooud of many blacks today?

While the store detectives are so busy following black people in their stores the white shoplifters are robbing them blind. I have seen many white people shoplifting, almost every time I go into a busy store I see them stuffing things under their shirts. I once even saw a white woman stuffing meat under her shirt in a supermarket. The store detectives were probably focusing on me at the time. <br>  <br>  As for the answerer who's mother was attacked, that could just as easily been a white guy.

How would you feel about the relatively crime-prone group? The relatively crime-free group? Wouldna€?t you want to know about such differences? <br>  <br>  But we dona€?t have to imagine anything. The above contrast was not a hypothetical case, but rather the statistical relationship of black to Asian crime in America, as detailed in the new report, The Color of Crime, released by the New Century Foundation, the organization that sponsors American Renaissance magazine.<br>  <br>  * a€?a€| between 2001 and 2003, blacks were 39 times more likely to commit violent crimes against whites than the reverse, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery.a€?<br>  <br>  * Between 2001 and 2003, blacks committed, on average, 15,400 black-on-white rapes per year, while whites averaged only 900 white-on-black rapes per year.<br>  <br>  * a€?Of the nearly 770,000 violent interracial crimes committed every year involving blacks and whites, blacks commit 85 percent and whites commit 15 percent.a€?<br>  <br>  But there are five-and-one-half as many whites as blacks. If anything, the numbers should be reversed. After all, as leftists always tell us, all groups are supposed to be equally represented in all categories, for good or ill. (Well, not really. Leftists never call on the NBA and NFL to institute racial parity for white players.)<br>  <br>  * Nationally, youth gangs are 90 percent non-white. a€?Hispanics are 19 times more likely than whites to be members of youth gangs. Blacks are 15 times more likely, and Asians are nine times more likely.a€?<br>  <br>  * The only crime category in which Asians are more heavily represented than whites is illegal gambling.<br>  <br>  * a€?Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against blacks. Forty-five percent of their victims are white, 43 percent are black, and 10 percent are Hispanic. When whites commit violent crime, only three percent of their victims are black.a€?<br>  <br>  But how can that be, when for years commentators of all political persuasions have insisted that the majority of the victims of black crime are themselves black? But it has been true for some time, because blacks increasingly target whites based on the color of the lattera€?s skin.

The commonality I see in these subjects is that a person can reach a knowledge of "the divine" (or whatever name you prefer) through any one of the three.  To me, philosophy is a field of study and is purely intellectual (theory), some fields of which concern themselves with the big questions of life that go beyond thoughts and forms.  Religion, in a few of its manifestations, is focused on practices and disciplines that may lead one to an experience of the divine.  The word "mysticism" is used in so many different ways, I hesitate to generalize.  However, but, by some understandings, it refers to a direct experience of the divine.  There are "schools" of mysticism, and mystics, in all of the major world religions.  I can only think of one mystic in mainstream Protestantism, but Roman Catholicism has a long history of mystics.  All of the major Eastern and Middle Eastern religious traditions have mystics and mystic schools.  One that comes to mind, from Islam, is Sufism.  Of all the religious groupings, I consider various schools of Buddhism as having the most mystical understanding of life.|`|KssT3Jtpaa	whener I see the word philosophy I think:<br>  <br>  philo= love of<br>  sophia= wisdom<br>  <br>  sophia= the last aeon born from the womb of barbelo who wished to create without the aide of her partner and was imprisoned by her creation. her creation became the architect of this world and he used her power to create a flawed realm and a host of 'powers' to do his bidding. she was saved when she repented for her mistakes and 'logos' travelled through all the aeons to return her to a place above her son, saklas or samael (the blind god)- to return her to her home in the eternal aeon.<br>  <br>  Religion is a system, a primal form of government- used to organize large groups of people around the frame of some dogma.<br>  <br>  mysticism is when someone tries to figure it out.|`|1tVtlLZpaa	Dear Luigi, <br>  God is the creator of the universe, He created you and I.  We are created of, by, and for Love.  This is realized in relationship with Him.  No other experience can come close to the experience of loving God and knowing His Love for us.  It is truly all satisfying.  Furthermore, since philosophy is a search for truth, a relationship with God fully satisfies, since in relationship with God, you fully experience Truth in a direct, immediate and all fulfilling way.  As for religion, I am not sure, there are so many religions, that it is hard to say.  I am a Christian - yet for many years I did not practice or associate with Christians because so many seemed mean spirited, and hypocritical.  However once you find yourself in experience of God all that is washed away and you enjoy great fulfillment.  It is truly wonderful.

Baptists baptize by immersion; United Methodists use immersion, sprinkling, and pouring. United Methodists have communion open to all; Baptists open the table to baptized church members only. United Methodists have bishops and are governed by districts and Conferences of churches; Baptists have independent congregations, which choose their pastors. United Methodist pastors are sent to congregations by bishops, after consultation with the congregation. United Methodism ordains women as pastors and elects them as Superintendents and Bishops.<br>  <br>  Sounds like Methodist are not following some parts of scripture -- no wonder why there is division :(<br>  <br>  <br>  Peace and grace,|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	In the end, each religion has the same basic goal; repentance & getting to Heaven.

It's my understanding that some Methodist denominations are more liberal.<br>  <br>  It's my understanding that both denominations agree on the core doctrines - how to be go to Heaven, the trinity, scripture etc. <br>  <br>  One of the differences I've seen is that Methodists tend to think that salvation can be lost. Baptists tend to think that salvation cannot be lost. Personally, I think that we can learn a lot from Judas. He appeared sincere. He was never saved though. <br>  <br>  Another difference I see is that Baptists tend to think pre-trib. Methodists tend to "pray for pre, but prepare for post". <br>  <br>  I see minor differences like that. I consider them both correct where it counts.|`|LpyEAcjeaa	Baptists are Calvinists.

There is no real conflict; one can believe that god created the earth and still believe in evolution.<br>  <br>  The term Creation Science is particularly misleading -- it is religion, not science.

ZmdIlkpQaa	It doesn't bother me.  In fact, given the prevalence of knee-jerk reactions among some Christians to Pagan faiths and ideas, it actually amuses me a great deal.  Christmas and Easter are the two most obvious ones, and in both cases, some Christians will howl about how Atheists and others should not be given days off or should not celebrate those holidays, since they are Christian in nature.  It's then me pleasure to refer them to history and to note that neither of those holidays exist in their scripture.  They are, patently, taken directly from Pagan practices of fertility and the rebirth of the Sun God, with just a thin veneer (and a ahistorical and ascriptural one, at that) of Christianity.<br>  <br>  I do enjoy the idea that, perhaps without knowing it, they're celebrating my Gods and my faith.<br>  <br>  Blessed Be!|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	This is silly.  There is no such thing as a single "Pagan" faith and Christian holidays were taken from various sources.  Christmas was adopted from Brumalia/Saturnalia - a Roman festival (which yes itself shared origins with all other Winter Solstice celebrations but again it's not that they all go back to one identifiable proto-Pagan unified faith).<br>  <br>  There IS scriptural identification for Easter dating (he went into Jerusalem for the Passover festival after all) and yes the English name is taken from Eostre, one in a long line of Vernal Equinox feasts, again which do not share a single progenitor.<br>  <br>  Many societies developed seasonal feasts independently.  This is because seasonality is universal to the hemisphere, not because "Pagans" had one single religion.|`|gkOQEFN7aa	Um no, not really. And Baal and Ashtaroth have nothing to do with my gods what so ever. We don't even have a "Jesus tpye figure" in our mythology unless you want to warp the Balder myths based on post-Christian writings.<br>  <br>  If they want to celebrate around Yule what do I care? If they want to borrow the traditions, what do I care? I am not celebrating Jesus and they aren't celebrating the gods, so really we aren't celebrating the same thing at all.<br>  It does bother me when Christians aren't aware of where thier traditions come from but a lot of them do. So go for it.|`|7cBOKehWaa	Doesn't bother me really. I'd like them to at least acknowledge the roots of their holidays though.<br>  <br>  Did you know the yule log was orginally made out of cheese?

Christ's birthday is actually supposed to be late spring/early summer.<br>  <br>  It somewhat confuses me that Catholocism and Christianity won considering they go off this Bibble story book. I'd think earth religions would ultimately make more sense but the allure of the Bible is understandable. It all basically revolves around what happens after death then some morality tales mixed in there. I suppose people are more interested in that.<br>  <br>  And no, I really follow no religion. I just try to learn about them and understand it all. All I have been able to conclude is that there can be no ultimate understanding. ^_^;|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Let's put this in a more realistic perspective here, shall we?<br>  <br>  First of all, they weren't *mine* to begin with - as I didn't exist prior to Christianity and the creation of Easter and Christmas as Christian holidays.<br>  <br>  Secondly, Christianity didn't adopt my holidays.  Christianity is not honoring the spring Goddess at Easter, or the yearly rebirth of the sun god at Christmas.  They are honoring Jesus - which is not a part of my holiday celebrations - as I do not believe that Jesus was any more than a wise man that once existed.<br>  <br>  What *they* may have adopted, was some pre-existing pagan customs and traditions for each of their holidays - such as decorating with evergreens, and giving out colored eggs.  <br>  <br>  Seriously, what's the big deal about that?  <br>  <br>  This pagan is getting more than sick of the "what custom belongs to which group" argument.  The continual bickering and childish behavior over folks celebrating their own holidays is what upsets me.  There is no reason we can't celebrate our respective holidays for what they mean to us.  We could even share in some of the similar customs and traditions that we both practice - even if they symbolize different things to each of us.|`|xBsUDM5oaa	Greetings!<br>  <br>  When "The Bible" was revised to it`s current form, most of the anti-Semite, anti-Pagan, stuff was left in, and anything relating to the practices of the early followers of Jesus was left out.<br>  <br>  The early followers of Jesus were certainly not "Christians" as that term was invented much later, by people who did NOT want to become Jewish, as Rab Yeshua was.<br>  <br>  In Europe, "Pagan" practice was diverse, and Ancient, so the "Church" built Ritual and Holy-Days upon already existing ideas.<br>  <br>  Now, why did the later "Church" burn Books? So only THEIR version of History would be taught. Catholics mix Salt and Water, Fire and Air, ask for Blessings from Winged, Invisible Beings at the Cardinal Points, have Altars, Idols, Tools, fancy Robes, meet in Secret, have huge Temples, and steal Holy-Days in order to promote themselves, and squash "Pagan" Ways.<br>  <br>  Many other Christians do not do these things, but many do. <br>  <br>  So, Christians are certainly welcome to Celebrate as they wish, when they wish, but don`t pretend that you don`t "use" Pagan Ways-as I said, some Christians reject the Pagan Holy-Days, the Pagan Holy Ways, and this is just fine.<br>  <br>  Just let us Worship as we Will, as we Did, as we Do.<br>  <br>  ok?<br>  <br>  God Wills It.<br>  <br>  ( And Goddess too! )<br>  <br>  /!\|`|paRGbr7Xaa	Eh, not really. It bugs me more when they don't acknowledge the fact that it wasn't originally a Christian holiday.

We borrow from one another.  It's okay.|`|72c3b924e93e85f5493bc3f07051afb4aa	Well, you're terribly mistaken.  Christmas would refer to the birth of Christ and Easter would referring to his resurrection of the Christ both in the bible.<br>  <br>  I'll just touch on Easter as this will be a long one.  Easter takes place at the same time as Jewish Passover and, as such, is not a fixed date on the calendar but instead moves around. Because of its connection to Passover, Easter is also sometimes referred to as Pascha, a word that appears in both Latin and Greek but comes from the Hebrew Pesah, or Passover.<br>  <br>  Although Easter is just one day in the liturgical calendar, in reality preparations for Easter take place throughout the 40 days of Lent and it plays a central role in the following 50 days of Pentecost (also known as the Easter season). Thus, Easter can rightly be regarded as the central day in the entire Christian calendar.<br>  <br>  Easter is treated not simply as a commemoration of events that occurred at one time in the past. Instead, Easter is regarded as a living symbol of the very nature of Christianity. During Easter, Christians believe that they symbolically pass through death and into a new life (spiritually) in Jesus Christ, just as Jesus passed through death and after three days rose from the dead.<br>  <br>  Not all Easter traditions are Christian in nature. Many are pagan "imports" and, even then, many pagan and Christian traditions have been secularized over time. The Easter Bunny, for example, derives from the worship of the Anglo-Saxon goddess of fertility Eastre (hence the name Easter) whose natural symbol was the rabbit. Use of the Easter Bunny was brought to America by German immigrants - non-German Christians ignored the rabbit until some time after the Civil War when the celebration of Easter became more widespread.<br>  <br>  Easter Eggs also predate Christian Easter celebrations. Pagan groups long exchanged eggs at some point near the beginning of Spring as symbol of fertility and the hope that the coming summer crops would be good. These eggs were also often painted with bright colors to represent the colors of spring, from the blooming flowers and the bright sun (remember that in the northern regions there is much less sunlight during the winter). Different cultures today color their eggs in different ways. For example, in Greece it is common to exchange eggs which have been colored crimson to represent the blood of Christ. Slavic countries tend to decorate their eggs with gold and silver and in parts of Germany and Austria, people exchange green eggs on Holy Thursday.<br>  <br>  So the name "Easter" is not Christian, but the Christian holiday coincides with the Jewish Passover and in some places "Easter" is actually referred to as Pascha.  Though the Christians have adopted some traditions (bunny, eggs), the actual holiday is not adopted.  Remember, Christianity arose from Jewish beliefs and the two are very interconnected even today.|`|wwdllMzYaa	nah<br>  it did for a while when i first learned of it<br>  but, i got used to it, and now , i find it amusing and quite a cool thing<br>  as its actualyl the way paganism survived, due to constantine being a pagan, THEN converting to christianty, because he had to<br>  didnt stop him caring about paganism<br>  <br>  it only disgusts me that their religion teaches otherwise, but, again, this speaks for itself, it only shows itsself up<br>  <br>  i think their god,if he is what THEY say he is, is very happy with it, he sounds like a right nut|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Roman Catholicism adopted pagan holidays.<br>  <br>  Please don't lump all Christians under that religious organization.

Hence the torment of the soul is what is happening. Not a physical torment.  Your soul can be tormented while you are alive and it is manefested in physical pain or illness. We can all atest to that. When that happens im not really sure. Some say when all the bodies are ressurected then we will be judged. Some think it is when we die...

That mean eternal....forever.<br>  <br>  Read Luke 16:19-31...it is about the rich man and Lazarus..  It is a true story for Jesus NEVER used real names in parables.  It's about the rich man in hell....If you don't think HELL is a real place...you'd better read this.  Carefully.<br>    I cannot understand how people can take their eternal lives so lightly.  Have you EVER read all of the new Testament?  I dare say most people who say there is no God have never read it....they just assume.  When God sent His beloved Son into this world it was because of love.   He could have MADE man to love him, but he wanted us to choose to love him.  God knew man would choose to sin, but before the foundation of the world, the Bible said Jesus was slain.  God knew His Son would willingly come and die in our place...pay the penalty for our sins.  The Bible says, For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  And He didn't just die a horrible death...He rose again..and sits on the right hand of His Father God in heaven, interceding for you and me to the Father.  He defeated Satan, death, hell and the grave!!!!  No dear one, it is not the end for any of us, whether it is heaven or hell.<br>  <br>  I put in caps.....GOD HAS DONE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO KEEP MAN OUT OF HELL...HE GAVE HIS ONLY SON TO DIE ON THE CROSS....HE WAS BEATEN BEYOND RECOGNITION ...YOU COULD NOT EVEN TELL HE WAS A  HUMAN......HE WAS SPIT ON, HIS BEARD PLUCKED OUT....REJECTED.....HATED.....ALL FOR YOU AND ME.....BECAUSSE OF LOVE.  He took our place on that cross...paid our sin debt so that we could spend eternity....forever and forever in the presence of God our Father who created us for fellowship and a relationship with him.   I wouldn't want to miss that for any sin in this world.  Don't let Satan deceive you...The Bible says "Satan goes to and fro on the earth seeking whom he may devour."  He does not want you to have a relationship with God or with Jesus Christ.  The Bible says he is the father of lies.<br>  <br>  I can't find the verses right now but there is a place in the New Testament where is speaks of these earthly bodies will be changed into perfect heavenly bodies.  These bodies are sinful...so they cannot be in heaven like they are....we will be changed in the "twinkling of an eye."   So dear one.....get your Bible out and read that precious book to discover  for yourself what God has in store.  It says, "eye has not seen nor has the ear heard what God has prepared for those who love Him.....get ready....He IS coming to get his own...and by the looks of all that is going on in Israel (prophesied in the Old Testament) it won't be long.<br>  <br>  Once again God gives you a choice to accept His Son, Jesus Christ and the price he paid for YOU on the cross.... or REJECT HIM....HEAVEN OR HELL:  IT IS YOUR CHOICE!  God doesn't send you to hell you choose it.    ......God Bless.|`|whM7DOy9aa	I know this is soooo long but decided to give you the most thourough answer you can get using your bible. It is very important that you use your bible when reading the following excerpt. If you would like to learn more you can go to www.watchtower.org. You can even click the link to have a FREE HOME BIBLE STUDY to find out answers to your most troubling questions including "Why does God allow suffering?".<br>  <br>  <br>  Chapter Six<br>  <br>  Where Are the Dead?<br>  <br>  What happens to us when we die?<br>  <br>  Why do we die?<br>  <br>  Would it be comforting to know the truth about death?<br>  <br>  THESE are questions that people have thought about for thousands of years. They are important questions. No matter who we are or where we live, the answers concern each one of us.<br>  <br>  2 In the preceding chapter, we discussed how the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ opened the way to everlasting life. We also learned that the Bible foretells a time when “death will be no more.” (Revelation 21:4) Meanwhile, we all die. “The living are conscious that they will die,” said wise King Solomon. (Ecclesiastes 9:5) We try to live as long as possible. Still, we wonder what will happen to us when we die.<br>  <br>  3 When our loved ones die, we mourn. And we may ask: ‘What has happened to them? Are they suffering? Are they watching over us? Can we help them? Will we ever see them again?’ The world’s religions offer differing answers to these questions. Some teach that if you live a good life, you will go to heaven but if you live a bad life, you will burn in a place of torment. Other religions teach that at death, people pass on to the spirit realm to be with their ancestors. Still other religions teach that the dead go to an underworld to be judged and are then reincarnated, or reborn in another body.<br>  <br>  4 Such religious teachings all share one basic idea—that some part of us survives the death of the physical body. According to almost every religion, past and present, we somehow live on forever with the ability to see, hear, and think. Yet, how can that be? Our senses, along with our thoughts, are all linked to the workings of our brain. At death, the brain stops working. Our memories, feelings, and senses do not continue to function independently in some mysterious way. They do not survive the destruction of our brain.<br>  <br>  WHAT REALLY HAPPENS AT DEATH?<br>  <br>  5 What happens at death is no mystery to Jehovah, the Creator of the brain. He knows the truth, and in his Word, the Bible, he explains the condition of the dead. Its clear teaching is this: When a person dies, he ceases to exist. Death is the opposite of life. The dead do not see or hear or think. Not even one part of us survives the death of the body. We do not possess an immortal soul or spirit.<br>  <br>  6 After Solomon observed that the living know that they will die, he wrote: “As for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all.” He then enlarged on that basic truth by saying that the dead can neither love nor hate and that “there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in [the grave].” (Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6,?10) Similarly, Psalm 146:4 says that when a man dies, “his thoughts do perish.” We are mortal and do not survive the death of our body. The life we enjoy is like the flame of a candle. When the flame is put out, it does not go anywhere. It is simply gone.<br>  <br>  WHAT JESUS SAID ABOUT DEATH<br>  <br>  7 Jesus Christ spoke about the condition of the dead. He did so with regard to Lazarus, a man whom he knew well and who had died. Jesus told his disciples: “Lazarus our friend has gone to rest.” The disciples thought that Jesus meant that Lazarus was resting in sleep, recovering from an illness. They were wrong. Jesus explained: “Lazarus has died.” (John 11:11-14) Notice that Jesus compared death to rest and sleep. Lazarus was neither in heaven nor in a burning hell. He was not meeting angels or ancestors. Lazarus was not being reborn as another human. He was at rest in death, as though in a deep sleep without dreams. Other scriptures also compare death to sleep. For example, when the disciple Stephen was stoned to death, the Bible says that he “fell asleep.” (Acts 7:60) Similarly, the apostle Paul wrote about some in his day who had “fallen asleep” in death.—1?Corinthians 15:6.<br>  <br>  8 Was it God’s original purpose for people to die? Not at all! Jehovah made man to live forever on earth. As we learned earlier in this book, God placed the first human couple in a delightful paradise. He blessed them with perfect health. Jehovah wanted only good for them. Does any loving parent want his children to suffer the pain of old age and death? Of course not! Jehovah loved his children and wanted them to enjoy endless happiness on earth. Concerning humans, the Bible says: “Time indefinite [Jehovah] has put in their heart.” (Ecclesiastes 3:11) God created us with the desire to live forever. And he has opened the way for that desire to be fulfilled.<br>  <br>  WHY HUMANS DIE<br>  <br>  9 Why, then, do humans die? To find the answer, we must consider what h|`|ZA11WBR2aa	I asked a similar question a few days ago, the answer given to me is self explanatory, hope this helps.  <br>  <br>  <br>  What happens after death? Do you go to heaven or hell right away?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As soon as you die, two angels come down into your grave and ask you the following questions, they will ask you the following questions, the believers will answer correctly but non-believers will not be able to.<br>  <br>  1.

(an image or a picture would be shown)<br>  <br>  You don't go to heaven or hell right away, you go into a stage which is called "Barzak".

8KxurcApaa	This scenario definitely sounds like it COULD be racial discrimination but I seriously doubt you will be able to prove this feeling in court.  If you feel particularly slighted by the situation you could contact the corporate headquarters and the owner of that particular McDonald's & ask for an explanation.<br>  <br>  The idea that this is reverse discrimination is misinformed; you weren't excluded because you were a white male but more so because you were not Hispanic (as you mentioned ... no blacks worked there either).  Additionally, an organization as large as McDonald's would not employ quotas to increase diversity at that level.  Maybe in their corporate offices; but definitely not at a store level where they can prove they hire countless minorities all over the nation (and beyond).<br>  <br>  As for attacking Affirmative Action, the program is far from perfect but this is a poor choice of scenario to argue against it.  I suggest you open a thread asking for the faults of AA on this very site so you will be better informed.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	This is called reverse discrimination, and it is perfectly legal. Most organizations have almost a "quota" of minority people that they need to meet in their organization. Unfortunately, it means that if you are a white male and apply for the same position as a white female, hispanic, or african american, even if you have the same or sometimes better qualifications, you may not get the job. If you have any issue with this, your beef is not with McDonald's. It is actually with the government. Many times, they will offer special grants or circumstances to businesses with a higher amount of minority workers.<br>  <br>  *edit* I did not say this to piss you off, I don't necessarily agree with the concept, I am just answering your question. If you are angry about what I said, you really should take it up with the government or McD's. I did a paper on reverse discrimination while I was getting my university degree and found, in the end, that it was the most unfair practice I have ever heard of. In fact, I have been turned down for positions just because I am white before.|`|6755d6124814f8a889ed9508dc8b6638aa	You have Affirmative Action to thank for that....<br>  <br>  They don't count it as dicrimination as long as it's who THEY want in there.

el1jdpnOaa	To the masses the poor and so called degenerates of society are nothing more than a burden. BUT to those who have compassion and understanding of a greater meaning in life other than material success, the poor can be used as an example of the complexity and diversity of lives being lived on this planet. Until humanity learns to recognize and accept that wealth and material gains are nothing more that an illusion holding together big government, Only "god" will love the poor. If people didnt spend money then the economy would crash, if the economy crashes then the governments would fail. This is precisely why Governments all over the world condition children with laws from birth to accept that their "destiny is to find a job and make money.

Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out.

I just went through the same situation and I don't know what the deal was - it had never happened to me before and to be honest, it scared me a little. I don't have insurance, so I'm still trying to find a Doctor (Yay for Canada!). But I recommend that you do - I did a little research (on WebMD) and found that prolonged bleeding can be a cause of many dangerous things. Even if it's just a low risk, get it checked out. Go to a Doctor, tell them what's going on and have them look into it. Your life and health are important :-)|`|6a9AfhsLaa	god, people can be mean.....<br>  <br>  well, you probably should go through therapy. You have to go to therapy to get hormones and such. It usually takes, on average, a year, but it can be more or less depending on therapist. But then they write a letter and refer you to an endochrinologist to get your hormones. though I have heard that its a real b- - - - to take testosterone, because it is usually only available in shots and the needle is frigging huge. <br>  <br>  but you do need to go to a doctor, your hormones could be out of balance, and I knew someone who almost died becuase their estrogen was so off, and she had to have surgery to fix it. So you dont want to wait too long. but see a doctor, and see a therapist. email is you wanna chat.|`|CJvHQl5vaa	Here is the deal:  Properly speaking, you should go should go see a doctor.  The reason for this is that it is very hard for you to distinguish between hemmorhaging versus a period that just won't quit.  Planned Parenthood would be one place to go for affordable care.  The doctor can assess whether or not you have a dangerous problem or just a period that won't end.  <br>  <br>  Once the doctor rules out a dangerous problem, she or he will either tell you to wait it out (although 6 weeks is extreme) or s/he will recommend progesterone pills for a short period of time to stop the bleeding.  Progesterone pills work, but if you are more into homeopathic remedies, you can buy an herb called Shepherd's Purse.  You seep it for 10 minutes like tea, strain it, add a hella lot of maple syrup or honey (it doesn't taste very good) and down it.  Shepherd's purse should make your neverending period end.  Sometimes it takes several doses, so make sure you research Shepherd's Purse before you try it.  It has been a few years, so I don't remember frequency and duration of treatment with Shepherd's Purse.<br>  <br>  I have been there, my friend, and that just sucks, I am sorry.  <br>  <br>  I am not sure about the testosterone pills, patches or shorts as a curative measure.  I know a little bit of testosterone will just make the periods suck more, it won't make them go away.  Women with PCOS tend to have increased testosterone, and while their periods suck and they don't ovulate normally, it doesn't stop their periods, so I am extrapolating from that knowledge.  I don't know what larger levels might do.  I think your issue is more about the abundance of estrogen in your system.  To reduce that is more complicated than to just add testosterone.  The two don't cancel each other out. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

AA11047076	Judaism doe snot believe in original sin- simply because we do not believe that a person can be guilty of a sin committed by someone else!  Similarly, someone cannot repent for someone elses sin which is why we find the notion of Jesus being atpnement for other people so bizarre!<br>  <br>  So, try as you might you can search all 62 sections of the Mishnah, or any of the Maschtas in the talmud and you won't find any mention of original sin.<br>  <br>  A couple of notes on what other people have said:<br>  You CAN repent wilful sin.  However, unlike accidental sins for which a sacrifice is brought- a wilful sin is repented through actions and repentance alone.  One has to forego the sin, and make sure to adjust ones life in such a manner that they do not repeat the sin.  <br>  <br>  Psalm 51 is not referring to original sin.  What David is referring to their is the fact that sex should be within the context of marriage and for purposes of love and bonding between a husband and wife.  when it is a purely lust filled action, devoid of the more spiritual goals which transmute it from an animal act to a holy act, it is "sinful"  However, within the context of Judaism sin is not an evil act- it is an act which misses the purpose it was intended for.  The word for sin is the same as the word for missing an archery target.  thus David says that just as he acted out of lust and animal behaviours in pursuing Bat Sheva, so his parents acted out of lust when he was conceived.  it does not mean he was born sinful, just that the act of sex is an extraordinarily powerful one, and one that often leads people astray.<br>  <br>  And the psalm also proves that even wilful sin can be atoned for:<br>   2. When Nathan the prophet came to him when he went to Bath-sheba.<br>  3. Be gracious to me, O God, according to Your kindness; according to Your great mercies, erase my transgressions.<br>  <br>  As you can see in verse 3- he repents his actions and asks for atonement.  It goes on to talk about how it is repentance, not sacrifices that atone later on:<br>  <br>   18. For You do not wish a sacrifice, or I should give it; You do not desire a burnt offering.<br>  19. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; O God, You will not despise a broken and crushed heart.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You sure are wrong about that.<br>  <br>  Psalm 51:5<br>  <br>  Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother conceived me.<br>  <br>  Now the Talmud is a whole separate inferior and self-referencing document.

The Tanakh does have passages that talk about the universal sinfulness of humankind.  But Jewish theology never bothered with the question of why we sin.  It is just taken as a given.  Indeed, there is no remedy for willful sin under the Jewish Law.  The day of atonement comes closest, but that is an act of corporate repentance and confession.  Under the Law willful personal sin could be forgiven by God based on repentance and confession, but that forgiveness is arbitrary.  God simply sets aside the demands of justice.  Christian theology gave this truth a theological foundation by positing the self sacrifice of Christ as the satisfaction of divine justice.  This is one instance of Christianity transcending its Jewish origins.  <br>  <br>  peace|`|el8yX5q3aa	Why do you who question religion think we have all the answers?  We do not.

It is not saying what you think it is saying.<br>  <br>  Another clue about it is this. What did Jesus say the greatest commandment was?|`|4fTiCNiKaa	Yes. The question isn't "are we to" but "how are we to". How do we as Christians keep the Sabbath?<br>  <br>  The only why we can is through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Jesus is our Sabbath rest. Jesus can be our Sabbath rest in part because He is “Lord of the Sabbath” (Matthew 12:8). As God incarnate, He decides the true meaning of the Sabbath because He created it, and He is our Sabbath rest in the flesh. When the Pharisees criticized Him for healing on the Sabbath, Jesus reminded them that even they, sinful as they were, would not hesitate to pull a sheep out of a pit on the Sabbath. Because He came to seek and save His sheep who would hear His voice (John 10:3,27) and enter into the Sabbath rest He provided by paying for their sins, He could break the Sabbath rules. He told the Pharisees that people are more important than sheep and the salvation He provided was more important than rules. By saying, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath” (Mark 2:27), Jesus was restating the principle that the Sabbath rest was instituted to relieve man of his labors, just as He came to relieve us of our attempting to achieve salvation by our works. We no longer rest for only one day, but forever cease our laboring to attain God’s favor. Jesus is our rest from works now, just as He is the door to heaven, where we will rest in Him forever.<br>  <br>  Hebrews 4 is the definitive passage regarding Jesus as our Sabbath rest. The writer to the Hebrews exhorts his readers to “enter in” to the Sabbath rest provided by Christ. After three chapters of telling them that Jesus is superior to the angels and that He is our Apostle and High Priest, he pleads with them to not harden their hearts against Him, as their fathers hardened their hearts against Jehovah in the wilderness. Because of their unbelief, God denied that generation access to the holy land, saying, “They shall not enter into My rest” (Hebrews 3:11). In the same way, the writer to the Hebrews begs them—and us—not to make the same mistake by rejecting God’s Sabbath rest in Jesus Christ. “There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his. Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience” (Hebrews 4:9-11). <br>  <br>  There is no other Sabbath rest besides Jesus. He alone satisfies the requirements of the Law, and He alone provides the sacrifice that atones for sin. He is God’s plan for us to cease from the labor of our own works. We dare not reject this one-and-only Way of salvation (John 14:6). God’s reaction to those who choose to reject His plan is seen in Numbers 15. A man was found gathering sticks on the Sabbath day, in spite of God’s plain commandment to cease from all labor on the Sabbath. This transgression was a known and willful sin, done with unblushing boldness in broad daylight, in open defiance of the divine authority. “And Jehovah said to Moses, ‘The man shall surely be put to death’” (v. 35). So it will be to all who reject God’s provision for our Sabbath rest in Christ. “How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?” (Hebrews 2:3).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Elder Greg<br>  ~SFECU~<br>  pray4revival|`|79uzTFl7aa	Another simplistic idea that the Jews have held onto after Jesus (Moschiach) abolished it.

I think this means that not even God has to work all 7 days in the week, and we shouldn't have to, either.  <br>  <br>  To C.S. Lewis, who in middle age made a surprise marriage to a Jewish ex-communist from America who had converted to Christianity, the old Jewish law (and Divine commandment) in this case was standing up for workers' rights.<br>  <br>  I think that's right.

They quoted from the other parts of the Law as well as from the Ten Commandments and considered all of it equally binding on those under the Law. (Mt 5:21-48; 22:37-40; Ro 13:8-10; Jas 2:10,?11) The Scriptures plainly state that Christ’s sacrifice “abolished .?.?. the Law of commandments consisting in decrees” and that God “blotted out the handwritten document against us, which consisted of decrees .?.?. and He has taken it out of the way by nailing it to the torture stake.” It was the complete Mosaic Law that was “abolished,” “blotted out,” taken “out of the way.” (Eph 2:13-15; Col 2:13,?14) Consequently, the whole system of Sabbaths, be they days or years, was brought to its end with the rest of the Law by the sacrifice of Christ Jesus. This explains why Christians can esteem “one day as all others,” whether it be a sabbath or any other day, with no fear of judgment by another. (Ro 14:4-6; Col 2:16) Paul made the following expression concerning those scrupulously observing “days and months and seasons and years”: “I fear for you, that somehow I have toiled to no purpose respecting you.”—Ga 4:10,?11.|`|vNvtwuBfaa	Romans 14:5 (KJV) <br>  5 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike.

aac509d23ce8da767d68e4f377f3f4c7aa	Saturday and Sunday are pagan names connected to the gods Saturn and the Sun god. That calender with those names was but one of many different ones. It was not always so! Go back to the book of Genesis and you will notice that days of the week are never named, but simply numbered.<br>  <br>  There is no argument about the Jewish sabbath being the one instituted by God in the Hebrew scriptures. It begins in the evening of what we call Friday (something to do with Genesis 1 delineating God's creative days with "Then there was evening and morning" - not morning then evening.) After Jesus was resurrected in the very early hours of what we call Sunday, his followers began to meet on that day to celebrate. Very quickly they had to draw a line between themselves and fellow Jews who did not believe in Jesus. Although Christians continued to go to the synagogue on Saturdays, with a view to sharing the gospel of Jesus, they had to show the Jews that converts to Christianity would not be circumcised (and thus obliged to keep Sabbath laws etc). If converts to Christ became circumcised, they would be enslaving themselves to law-keeping. But Christ had died to set them free from all that!<br>  <br>  The apostle Paul details profound theology on this. He warned Christians not to be enticed back to beggarly (elementary) things to do with law-keeping for they were now in the new covenant. They must not allow anyone to judge them with respect to a festival, or  a new moon observance, or a sabbath. They were free in Christ. Their salvation rested entirely in faith in what Jesus had done for them. That is why a distinction quickly appeared between Jewish sabbath-keeping and Christian times for worship.|`|9YMLsk7Taa	Because they either do not understand that Constantine changed the day of worship to sunday, or they do not believe the Ten Commandments are still meant to be honored.|`|89MKzLl3aa	All that God wants from us is to keep the Sabbath and to keep it holy. Arguing over what day of the week it should be is petty politicking.|`|HZqi9XyJaa	According to history Constantine tried to change Sabbath to Sunday so the Christians can worship with the pagans in honor of Sun Worship in 321. Constantine's change was accepted by the Papal Church and as the Papacy grew in power, it opposed Sabbath observance in favor of Sunday sacredness and made the day change official in the Council of Laodicea in 336. <br>  ______________________________________<br>  <br>  People give the reason that they honor Sunday now as the Sabbath instead of Saturday because Christ rose on Sunday. God NEVER said to do this. <br>  <br>  People also interpret scripture incorrectly, they think the apostles kept Sunday as the Sabbath but they didn't.... <br>  <br>  In Acts it mentions people had gotten together one Sunday with Paul to pray and worship. However, it didn't say anything about the Sabbath being changed. They just gathered together because Paul was leaving the following day. <br>  <br>  In Corinthians where it said to lay some money aside on the first day of the week, has nothing to do with tithing. If you read the entire section and in Romans it says why they did this...Paul wanted everything to be collected already before he showed up, so he wouldn't have to wait for them to do it while he was there. The collection went to those in Jerusalem because there was a financial need at the time, we know they supported a large number of widows (Acts 6:1-6) and were in the midst of famine (Acts 11:27-30). <br>  <br>  Another scripture that has been misinterpreted is in Colossians - So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ... but what they don't understand is that there are TWO sabbaths. One is the weekly Sabbath that God sanctified and made holy AT CREATION (Genesis 2:3 And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy) before there were even any Jews, which was just repeated in the 10 commandments. The other are ceremonial annual sabbaths (Feast of Unleavened Bread, Feast of Weeks, Feast of Trumpets, Day of Atonement, Feast of Tabernacles). The ceremonial laws pointed directly to Christ and were done away with when Christ died, not God's Holy laws. <br>  <br>  Saturday, not Sunday is the Sabbath. God never changed it. He said remember the Seventh Day Sabbath and keep it holy. We should obey God, and not follow after the traditions of men.|`|AA10471892	You are working from a false premise.  Sunday is not being honored as a sabbath.  If some mistakenly think Sundays should be treated like a sabbath, that is their error. <br>  <br>  Sunday became a day of corporate worship as a matter of custom.  Christians are not under the old covenant that has the sabbath as a requirement.  There are no sabbaths in Christianity.<br>  <br>  .|`|5aTGdBNuaa	Who is to say he didn't start on a Tuesday.

Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. <br>  <br>  Rom 14:6  He that regards the day, regards it unto the Lord; and he that regards not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it.

Both of which are wrong.<br>  <br>  1)  That THEY have the right to curtail the just civil rights of others by vote and making discriminatory laws and amendments.  <br>  <br>  2) That marriage is a "religious" or "Christian" institution.  <br>  <br>  Marriage existed before religions were ever invented.<br>  <br>  As for the law, it is the role of the court system (in part) to protect any minority from the discriminatory vote of the majority.  When Loving vs. the State of VA hit the Supreme Court in 1967, and the anti-misogyny laws were overturned, about 70% of the voters were STILL against interracial marriage.<br>  <br>  In 1967, the US Supreme Court stated the following in its decision in the case of Loving vs. Virginia: “The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.” In 2003 the Massachusetts Supreme Court extended this right to marry the person of one’s choice to gay men and women. Recently the State Supreme Courts of both CA and CN have agreed. However, the good "loving" anti-gay constituants of CA have decided that gay people were NOT to be afforded the same rights under the law that heterosexuals enjoy.<br>  The effort to enact laws or constitutional amendments, defining marriage as only the union of one man and one woman, may at first thought seem both reasonable and common sense; however, what is also does, is ignore the fact that 5 percent or more of our population are exclusively homosexual or lesbian, and to participate in this ‘marriage‘ they must necessarily marry a person of the same sex.. At one time, to enjoy the full rights of citizenship, one had to be a white male. Fortunately, since then, new amendments and new laws have been enacted to allow more people to engage in their rightful place as ‘full’ citizens under the law. But now it would appear that the new definition of a ‘full citizen’ now includes only heterosexuals, we see for the first time by law, an attempt to deny a significant portion of our population the full benefits of citizenship. When enacted, these amendments restrict by law one’s right to marry the one they would fall in love with.<br>  <br>  Instead of "protecting" marriage, they are diluting it. By denying ANYONE the right to marry damages the institution. It does not "protect" it. To ONLY allow "Civil Unions" is to state that marriage really does not matter.<br>  <br>  All those same "good" people out there who are trying to deny marriage to gays are the very same people who will then complain that gay relationships do not last and that gays are too promiscuous. They are the very people who SHOULD be promoting gay marrige in order to encourage committed relationships.<br>  <br>  To deny MARRIAGE TO GAYS is to state that the their most loving, committed, self-sacrificing relationship is NOT worthy of the same respect and regard as the most fleeting and casual marriage entered into by heterosexuals.<br>  <br>  To deny marriage to gays is stating to all the young gay teens growing up that NO we do NOT want to encourage you to have committed monagamous relationships. That there is something so wrong with you that your relationships are not as worthy as any heterosexual relationship.<br>  <br>  You MUST ALSO consider what is happening in many states who have passed "definitions" of marriage amendments to exclude gays. Some of the courts in these states are DENYING ANY rights to same sex partners IN SPITE of already existing laws to give them at least some of the rights gauaranteed to heterosexuals because they broadly interpret the "definition of marriage" amendments to indicate that the law should also NOT allow them any of the rights that married people would have. In addition, in some states, some companies who had given same-sex partners some of the benefits they would give to heterosexual couples have been brought to court by some of those nice "loving" anti-gay groups to disallow the companies from doing this. And some of the courts have declared in their favor.<br>  <br>  This so-called "protection of definition of marriage" is just another name for denying the full rights of citizenship under the law to gays. Manure by any other name would still smell as bad. This does NOT protect anything, it only denies to gays THE SAME RIGHTS GIVEN TO ALL HETEROSEXUALS.<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  FC:  You stated:  ". . .  homosexuals don't even have the right parts to begin to imitate the things of marriage."<br>  <br>  You mean that you devolve marriage and even human relationships to the base of mere sexual intimacy?  Is that all marriage is to you?  Th emotional and intimate support and joy in such a close and unique relationship is SO MUCH MORE than just sex.  And ALL individuals should have the right to enter into these relationships.  For the exclusively gay person it necessarily must be with another of the same sex.  It has NOTHING to do with "parts fitting."<br>  <br>  You continued:  "And it's a perverse form of the reality of true love."<br>  <br>  Now this is a tottally bigoted judgment.  TRUE LOVE DOES exist between many same sex couples and to judge differently without even knowing these people is shear bigotry and shows what kind of person you are.<br>  <br>  You heterosexuals need to be concerned about your own relationships.  More than 50% end in divorce, and of the remainder more than half of the partners cheat on their spouses.  You guys might have the same "parts" but obviously you still know very little about committed loving relationships.<br>  <br>  +=====================================...<br>  HONI SOIT . .  Maybe you could look up more information before making declarative statements.<br>  <br>  As of right now gay marriage is allowed in only two states,  MA and CN.  It is currently recognized in NY but not performed.<br>  <br>  And contrary to your statement they CAN and DO get married in many "Churches."  In fact the MCC which was formed in 1968 was established to minister to the gay christian community.  Even some "main line" churches such as Episcopalian, Methodist, The United Church of Christ, and others also perform gay marriage.  In fact my partner and I were married by a priest in a Catholic wedding service (even though the "official" Catholic Church is against such unions).<br>  <br>  Just thought I'd point this out.

Jesus said: “And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.” (John 10:16) Who, now, are those “other sheep”?<br>  <br>  6 Churches of Christendom claim that the “fold” there spoken of by Jesus was to contain only Jewish Christians, whereas the “other sheep” are those who become Christians from among the non-Jews or Gentiles; and that both believing Jews and believing Gentiles become “one flock” under the “one shepherd” in the one spiritual fold. But this teaching disagrees with other Bible scriptures bearing on the subject. Although the apostle John does not mention it in his Gospel account, Jesus did speak of an earthly Paradise under his kingdom and he spoke of others as being “sheep” besides the “little flock” of his heavenly joint heirs. When Jesus gave his prophecy on the “sign” of his then future presence and of the conclusion of the system of things, he closed it, according to Matthew’s account, with the parable of the sheep and the goats. Those “sheep” were to be different from Christ’s spiritual “brothers,” to whom these sheeplike ones do good things.—Luke 23:43; Matt. 24:3; 25:31-46.<br>  <br>  7 The apostle John was acquainted with that parable, for he and his brother James and also Peter and Andrew were the ones who promoted Jesus’ prophecy by asking him privately about the “sign,” and John heard that prophecy in full. (Mark 13:3, 4) So when he recorded Jesus’ words about the “other sheep” he could well have called to mind Jesus’ parable of the sheep and the goats. He was the aged apostle who was given the Revelation that disclosed that the 12 tribes of spiritual Israel would contain only 144,000 members. So he knew that the “sheepfold” containing the “little flock” would enfold only a limited number of all those saved.|`|V8Lyc2Jlaa	Big bad wolf ate them all!

HBp5r76haa	Speaking in tongues as the present Pentecostal Churches experience it, is ecstatic inspired speech in a language or languages that one does not know and it takes two forms. Sometimes such languages exist but the person who receives them is not able to speak them in the natural, such as what happened to the apostles at Pentecost  – They started speaking languages, given to them supernaturally by the Holy Spirit, which were not known to them but were known to others.<br>  <br>  Other times, believers start breaking out in non-existing languages that take the name of “heteroglossa”, which are not known on the earth and have no specific translation. They can be interpreted, but they can’t be translated. It is a language given to the believer, which he has no previous knowledge of.<br>  <br>  The gift of tongues is supernatural and cannot be learned by our own means.  Missionaries traveling to foreign remote countries may experience such gift when requested to preach in existing languages unknown to them. Suddenly they may become empowered by the Holy Ghost and they would start speaking that language fluently.<br>  Sometimes, the unknown glossa of a message sound like known languages, such as Japanese or Arabic, or some African dialects. But most of the times, the messages will be in “heteroglossa” – or different tongues. These are referred to in the New Testament by Paul as “the tongues of angels” or heavenly languages (“If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels…” - I Corinthians 13:1) which can only be interpreted, not translated. Messages in tongues are direct witnesses of and to God’s presence and work in the midst of a gathering of believers. <br>  <br>  This gift was initially manifested on the day of Pentecost, with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on assembled believers (Acts 2:4 “All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.”). It reflects an internal filling by the Holy Ghost: Jesus said: “’He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water’. (By this spoke He of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given” - John 7:39, KJV).|`|r8rykCkGaa	Praying in tongues and speaking in tongues is a different gift.  You pray in tongues privately and you might be able to interpret it but most people can't.  The speaking in tongues is in known languages and someone in the room may understand the language but it needs to be interpreted for all to hear.  It's always an important word from the Lord.  But the praying in tongues is for edification for the person who is praying and it's mostly praise really.|`|DB9QbZoQaa	No.<br>  The curtain is torn.<br>  Speaking in tongues that can not be interpreted by the flesh is a-kin to groanings to deep for fleshly understanding.<br>  When this occurs all present will, in the spirit, be edified, this includes the speaker.

There is absolutely no known example of Angels speaking in any language other then a language known to the listener.  For that matter, what is the language of Heaven?  Where is there any indication people in Heaven speak in any language other then a known earthly language?  There is none.  This idea is totally made up by man.<br>  <br>  Paul is simply saying, "if I came speaking to you as a man, or as an angel, and I didn't do it in love, it would be worthless."   He is not saying that the angels speak in a different language.<br>  <br>  And again, in the second verse you mentioned, there is absolutely nothing that would indicate Paul is speaking in a so called "heavenly" language that is unknown to man.  "Unknown tongue" can just as easily be an earthly language unknown to Paul.   If he did that, his understanding would be unfruitful because he wouldn't know what he was saying, and if he did that, it would have to be by the power of the spirit within him.  And, even if it was speaking about some unknown "heavenly" language, notice it does not say Paul DID speak in this language, but "IF" .<br>  <br>  Neither of these verses are speaking in any type of special "heavenly" language unknown to man.  First, both verses can be speaking of known earthly langueages with absolutely no stretching of the verse.  Secondly, there is absolutely no evidence or indication that there is any type of special "heavenly" language different then that found on earth.|`|vciEtUcPaa	If we read and study the Word and forget our prejudices,then it explains itself.With both known tongues and unknown tongues we speak and pray to God.I've been baptized in the Holy Spirit for over 28 years and I've been exposed to both known and unknown tongues.It's not gibberish at all.Anybody that says this doesn't understand this gift at all!In fact it's the entrance to the gifts of the Spirit.Just because you learn a language doesn't mean you have the gift of tongues.It's totally supernatural and doesn't have a thing to do with the intellect.To understand it better,do a study on the 3 parts that make up a man;spirit,soul,and body.It comes from the spirit of a man flowing from the Spirit of God that this manifests.|`|ruQFO71Zaa	No it doesn't always have to be a known language!

But we can ask God in prayer for the translation of the messaged.<br>  The Holy Spirit reveals our heart to God the way the Holy Spirit knows how.<br>  Sometimes, like if the Pastor does it, or a word is spoken in the Church congregation; Then there will be a translation (by 2 or 3). But sometimes only the person in the congregation who actually knows the language understands it.<br>  This has happened at my Church where the Pastor spoke in tongues, and the message was only for some who didn't speak english and were visitors. And they turned to Jesus Christ & were saved.<br>  <br>  So sometimes the message is from our heart but our heart is for the salvation for the lost. So the message from the Spirit is for those we may not even know but who are visitors.<br>  <br>  In reality, it is always going to be a language unknown to you or someone else. But God always understands it. Because God understands all languages in heaven & in earth.<br>  Compare that with a heart revelation, a spiritual revelation. And also with dreams.

It indicates that you received the baptism of the Holy Spirit at water baptism into the Mormon Church (the gate, the straight & narrow). And if you deny this, it would be better if you had not known. So this is adding to Gods Word & is a fear tactict. To reason out what the baptism of the Holy Spirit is.<br>  So this is dangerous, because people baptised into the Mormon Church don't get filled with the Holy Spirit. Because they are preaching another Gospel, other than the Gospel according to the Holy Bible.]<br>  <br>  15 And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the awords of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.<br>  17 Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen that your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause have they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter. For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost. <br>  20 Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life. <br>  <br>  So there isn't a real assurance of eternal life unless you never deny that you have been baptized in the Holy Spirit & you endure to the end.<br>  <br>  While Christian teaching that those in the upper room waiting were filled with the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost (They were already saved, born again, sealed of the Holy Spirit.).

It is telling Him you are too holy or too evil or to whatever for  Him to heal you.<br>  <br>  If that's your attitude, then He can't forgive you.  Remember we have free will.

At that time Paul had to show him that he was in error (read below Galatians 2:11-17). Actually Peter affirms Paul and his ministry, showing that they were not at odds with each other. He calls Paul a beloved brother and a man who had wisdom given to him by God(read below 2 Peter 3:15-17 )<br>  <br>  <br>  Galatians 2:11-17 (New Living Translation)<br>   11 But when Peter came to Antioch, I had to oppose him to his face, for what he did was very wrong. 12 When he first arrived, he ate with the Gentile Christians, who were not circumcised. But afterward, when some friends of James came, Peter wouldn’t eat with the Gentiles anymore. He was afraid of criticism from these people who insisted on the necessity of circumcision. 13 As a result, other Jewish Christians followed Peter’s hypocrisy, and even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.<br>   14 When I saw that they were not following the truth of the gospel message, I said to Peter in front of all the others, “Since you, a Jew by birth, have discarded the Jewish laws and are living like a Gentile, why are you now trying to make these Gentiles follow the Jewish traditions?<br>  <br>   15 “You and I are Jews by birth, not ‘sinners’ like the Gentiles. 16 Yet we know that a person is made right with God by faith in Jesus Christ, not by obeying the law. And we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be made right with God because of our faith in Christ, not because we have obeyed the law. For no one will ever be made right with God by obeying the law.”[a]<br>  <br>   17 But suppose we seek to be made right with God through faith in Christ and then we are found guilty because we have abandoned the law.

P1SdGAj3aa	The alphabet used in English, and with some variations in most other European languages, comes from Semitic speakers who adapted it from Egyptian hieroglyphics about 4,000 years ago. The rudiments of modern alphabetic order first appeared about 600 years later in Syria. With minor changes in letter order at each step, the alphabet passed from the Semites (including the Canaanites, Hebrews, and Phoenicians) to the Greeks to the Etruscans to the forebears of the Romans to us. As for the identity of the sage who first ordered it, and why that order, your guess is as good as mine.<br>  <br>  There's no obvious reason ABC is better than any other order. The dominant script of Ethiopia is related to our alphabet but uses a different order, likewise rooted in antiquity, based partly on letter shape. The more closely related Arabic script descends from an early alphabet having the same basic order as ours, but the letters have been partially rearranged according to shape and sound. The letters in the Irish writing system ogham, some of which were named after trees, began B, L, F. The Germanic runic script known as futhark is named after its first six letters ("th" represents one of them).<br>  <br>  The roots of ABC order are found in the cuneiform script of Ugaritic, the Semitic language of an ancient city in Syria. The letter shapes of this script aren't obviously related to our alphabet's direct ancestors, but the alphabetic order from a 14th-century BC inscription is virtually identical to later Hebrew and Phoenician letter lists, and the letter names are related.<br>  <br>  A Greek borrowed the 22 Phoenician letters around 800 BC - I say "a Greek" because idiosyncratic errors suggest one absentminded genius botched the job. Among other mistakes, he got several sibilant letters mixed up, and by the time things calmed down S and Z were the wrong shape and S was out of order. The same joker, or one who followed closely, gave exclusively vowel sounds to four letters theretofore primarily consonantal: ancestors of A, E, I, and O. Later Greeks added letters to the end, two of which interest us: chi, ancestral X, which over time acquired our modern "ks" sound; and upsilon, ancestral U, which was probably a vowel variant of the semivowel wau, since dropped from the Greek alphabet but ancestral to F.<br>  <br>  The Etruscans borrowed the Greek alphabet about 700 BC. They retained the letter order but dispensed with the Semitic-derived letter names, which is why we say "ay, bee," not "alpha, beta." (British zed, from zeta, is a holdout.)<br>  <br>  Latin borrowed the Etruscan alphabet about 600 BC. The Etruscans had no G sound and thus no corresponding letter, so eventually Latin G evolved from C - fittingly, because Etruscan C (pronounced "k") had come from the Greek gamma (pronounced "g" as in, well, gamma). Rather than sitting next to its sib, G took slot seven, replacing underutilized Z. Centuries later Z came back to transliterate Greek zeta and Y was introduced to represent upsilon. As newbies, Y and Z had to sit in the back.<br>  <br>  The modern English alphabet is the 23-letter Latin assortment with three additions hastened by the invention of movable type. W starts showing up in English letter lists in the 16th century, replacing the previous literal double U (or V) that denoted our current W sound. Naturally it was placed next to the then-undifferentiated U/V. The I/J and U/V cleavages came later - though the different shapes had existed for centuries, they weren't considered distinct letters in English until around 1700.<br>  <br>  So the roots of ABC order trace back to 14th-century BC Ugaritic. But why that order? Scholars don't know, but that hasn't stopped them from pulling wild guesses out of their urtexts. There's some slight, possibly coincidental correspondence between the meanings of the Semitic names of adjacent letters - for example, the yod-kaph-lamed sequence, meaning "hand, palm, cattle prod." Other explanations involve astrology, Sumerian musical scales, and divine intervention; one knucklehead even proposed that the Phoenicians named and ordered their letters after the days of the month in the Mayan calendar. Damn foolishness, all of it. The point isn't what order the alphabet is in, but that it's in order at all.<br>  <br>  — Cecil Adams|`|06513454f057ec526caa7fcd77f5e44baa	Aplphabetical order is completely arbitrary and just happened by a series of accidents over hundreds of years.

wB3AbJyLaa	Do you remember where you were during the final days of March 1997? That was when thirty-nine members of a group called Heaven's Gate dressed in identical black outfits, lay down on identical metal beds, and methodically killed themselves. The members of Heaven's Gate had been told that death would be the portal taking them to another life in a galaxy far away. This idea sounds silly to reasonable people, but for thirty-nine people who died because they believed this lie, the outcome was tragic. Today many people believe that all religions teach the same thing, or that they are all equal, or that it doesn't really matter what someone believes. But the tragedy of Heaven's Gate reveals that it does matter what someone believes. In some cases it's a matter of life and death. If you aren't convinced, check the entries on Jonestown, the Order of the Solar Temple, and some of the other deadly cults found online. In most cases people don't die from believing a lie, but their lives aren't all they could be. In the case of some controlling religious groups, people sacrifice their money, their relationships, and their free will for a self-proclaimed guru's promise of salvation.|`|wb6BWbf1aa	cults are religions and religions are cults, only difference thats made by the dictionary are the social acceptence and number of people who buy their crap.|`|hYZIYla0aa	they are people looking for something they cannot find,because it isn't there.|`|j0oU4V3baa	they're evil and so is religion|`|whM7DOy9aa	The term “cult” is used loosely by many who may not be fully aware of its connotations. To prevent confusion, some theologians actually avoid using the term.<br>  <br>  The World Book Encyclopedia explains that “traditionally, the term cult referred to any form of worship or ritual observance.” By that criterion, all religious organizations could be classified as cults. However, in general usage today, the word “cult” has a different meaning. The same encyclopedia notes that “since the mid-1900’s, publicity about cults has altered the meaning of the term. Today, the term is applied to groups that follow a living leader who promotes new and unorthodox doctrines and practices.”<br>  <br>  Endorsing the popular usage of the term, Newsweek magazine explains that cults “are normally small, fringe groups whose members derive their identity and purpose from a single, charismatic individual.” Similarly, Asiaweek magazine notes that “the term [cult] itself is vague, but it usually denotes a new religious creed built around a charismatic leader, who often proclaims himself to be the personification of God.”<br>  <br>  The language used in a joint resolution of the 100th Congress of the State of Maryland, U.S.A., also conveys the derogatory connotation of the term cult. The resolution states that “a cult is a group or movement exhibiting excessive devotion to a person or idea and employing unethically manipulative techniques of persuasion and control to advance the goals of its leaders.”<br>  <br>  Clearly, cults are generally understood to be religious groups with radical views and practices that clash with what is accepted today as normal social behavior. Usually they conduct their religious activities in secrecy. Many of these cultic groups actually isolate themselves in communes. Their devotion to a self-proclaimed human leader is likely to be unconditional and exclusive. Often these leaders boast of having been divinely chosen or even of being themselves divine in nature.<br>  <br>  Go to www.watchtower.org for more info...|`|DRSv6SOLaa	"Any" religion thaty denies The Holy Deity of Jesus Christ IS a Cult!!  <')))><|`|iRKOJhYeaa	I dont mind them as long as they dont try and get me to join

You can't say " I have potato plants", if all you did is throw the potatoes into the ground, they haven't grown into plants yet.
eb4ae3b4df14df881128b014fc84af33aa	I am 72 years young, and I have never known a Christian that hated Jews, least of all for killing Christ.  The Jews did not kill Christ however, the Romans killed Christ.  A single Jew betrayed Christ and gave Him to the Romans for His ultimate death.<br>  <br>  If the Government were in the hands of practicing Christians, we would have nothing to worry about.  The Jews need not worry either.  Christians, True Christians, love everybody and this includes the Jews.  The Problem is, the government is in the hands of people who may or may not be jews, hence, you believe them to be Christians.<br>  <br>  The last thing you have to worry about, is dedicated Christians in political office.|`|AA11297267	What's "aright?"  Are you trying to say "all right" or "alright?"<br>  <br>  Anti-semitism raises its ugly head on a regular basis -- and mostly comes from christians (who still blame the jews for "killing" jesus) and muslims (who blame jews for "taking" their land).  <br>  <br>  I find it amazing that such people can blame, say, the head of the CIA for either killing jesus (he certainly wasn't alive then) or taking land (he lives in the US, not in the middle east)...but bigotry doesn't depend on reason.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|Kiv4D2aWaa	Demographics? <br>  <br>  I'm not saying that it's a conspiracy.

bYDVTv7Maa	I've heard of people seeing the ghosts of animals. However, you have to remember that most 'ghosts' stay on this earth because of regrets or attachments to their previous lives and that not every soul remains as a ghost. Some may even be scared of "moving on".<br>  <br>  Animals, bugs and even plants probably don't have as many regrets/attachments as human beings, so therefore they would have no reason to stay here. They also probably wouldn't be scared to move on to the next world or phase of life, as animals and the like tend to listen to their instincts and go with the flow of the natural world more than humans do.<br>  <br>  There HAVE been sightings of bears, dogs, cats etc. But as for insects, if only a few stay behind, most are so small you wouldn't be able to really see them even if the were living.|`|msNXomjTaa	I have know people with the gift of "discernment of spirits" that have seen ghosts of animals - usually pets that have died.

78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	Going on the hypothetical.  I would not attend Church as it would be a lie.  Furthering your hypothetical if no faith was true.  I would do whatever I felt I could get away with and no I would not help the less fortunate unless I could see a benefit to myself.  Killing and stealing are not without social ramifications so one would have to be careful with those to make sure you do not get punished.  But, without God and faith all theft and Murder would be acceptable if needed or desired.|`|AA11297267	What do you mean "if"?<br>  <br>  While it's correct that it's impossible to prove there's no kind of god anywhere anytime, it's actually quite easy to prove that the christian god isn't real.  While the "some kind of god somewhere" idea is simply too vague and covers too many possibilities to prove wrong, the christian god's "holy book" makes specific claims, predictions, and testable statements that we can use to verify or disprove its existence.<br>  For example, the bible says in Matthew 17:20:<br>  "He replied, "Because you have so little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.""<br>  <br>  According to that claim, it takes the tiniest bit of faith and you can command a mountain to move and it will happen.  Among the billions of christians who have ever lived, surely some of them must have had the tiny bit of faith required...yet not one of them has ever moved a mountain.  And lots of things are still impossible for them -- such as regrowing limbs, saving lives, eliminating evil by praying for it to end, etc.<br>  <br>  That kind of testable statement, quite easily proven wrong, is conclusive evidence that the christian god is not real.  Or that he's a liar, which would mean he's not a god.  And there are literally hundreds more such testable claims in the bible, all of which fail miserable when put to the test.  Based on the evidence, it's quite easy to prove the christian god is not real -- so it's already been proven.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|USn04b4Paa	so what your saying is that if you died you just would be dead no after life your soul would die ...ok then i wouldn't think of sucide as ever an option cause lets say if i ever thought about it i didn't actually want to die die i wanted to be with God|`|AA11992885	i would have to wonder first, which concept of God was just proven to not exist, as i can prove right now that the christian God does not exist<br>  <br>  but the God i give homage to DOES exist|`|1e2aa41e34c037a92a687f6f7fcfcd71aa	Yes, I would immediately fulfil my secret desires to become a serial (insert crime here).|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Plagiarism is the best form of flattery.

Half of all pregnancies do not end in miscarriage - although 1/3 of all pregnancies end in abortion. The amount of accidental miscarriages would be less than this. <br>  <br>  Secondly, there is a misconception of what a "soul" is. God doesn't "put" the soul into a person; a living person IS a "soul". Genesis 2:7 says that God "breathed" life into Man, and Adam BECAME a living soul. He didn't RECEIVE a soul. Here is God's equation for the creation of life:<br>  <br>  BODY + BREATH (of God) = (LIVING) SOUL<br>  SOUL - BREATH (of God) = (DEAD) BODY<br>  <br>  A "soul" is the combination of body plus the breath of God. It's a living person. That spark of life has gone on in a continuum ever since Adam through procreation, so God has not had to re-breathe into everyone who is conceived - each generation receives the life that came from their parents - kind of like passing a flame from candle to candle down a row. <br>  The unborn baby received its life from its parents at conception. It became a living being at conception - a soul.|`|CvRMwulfaa	I wouldn't say half of pregnancies end in miscarriage, but at least 25% of pregnancies end before the egg is even implanted on the uterine wall.  If you want proof, read a human development textbook, it's there.  I'd like to know when people say a soul enters the body, is it from the sperm, the egg?  Is the soul waiting for the baby in the room when it is getting delivered?  I just don't see how they could say when.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Yes, even miscarriage victims have souls. Every soul has a purpose.

We are all sinners....lieing is a sin, cheating is a sin.....humans tend to catagorize big sins and little sins.  God doesn't do that.  <br>  <br>  I do want you to read this... and you decide....<br>  <br>  In Romans 1:24:<br>   So God let them go ahead and do whatever shameful things their hearts desired.  As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each others bodies  Instead of believing what they new was the truth about God, they deliberately chose to believe lies.  So they worshiped the things God made but not the Creator himself, who is to be praised forever. Amen  That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires.  Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other.  And the men, instead of having normal sexual relationships with women, burned with lust for each other.  Men did shameful things with other men and, as a result, suffered within themselves the penalty they so richly deserved.  When they refused to acknowledge God, He abandoned them to their evil minds and let them do things that should never be done. Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, gate, envy, murder, fighting, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip.  They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful.  They are forever inventing new ways of sinning and are disobedient to their parents. They refuse to understand, break their promises, and are heartless and unforgiving.  They are fully aware of God's death penalty for those who do these things, yet they go right ahead and do them anyway.  And worse yet, they encourage other to do them, too.<br>  <br>  So You decide.....is God please with your lifestyle?   It doesn't sound like it.   Yes....you can be forgiven of the homosexual lifestyle...but you also must repent of it....turn from it.  This verse clearly states it is not the natural way God intended.  He alone can help you get out of this lifestyle.|`|dYOpKvOCaa	K well I don't know abou the German part, that's just rude.

In order to be a publisher, there are requirements, so it is not just an attendee.<br>  <br>  Then publishers who are baptized can take on more responsibilities by volunteering or by assignment.<br>  <br>  These would be auxiliary pioneer, regular pioneer, special pioneer, missionary.<br>  <br>  Additional congregational responsibilities are handled by ministerial servants or elders.<br>  <br>  Traveling or visiting elders can be circuit overseers, district overseers or zone overseers.<br>  <br>  Then there are those who volunteer at Bethel. They may also be ministerial servants, auxiliary pioneers, elders, but also assigned to other teaching or publishing positions such as factory overseer, Gilead (missionary) instructor, Branch Committee member, writing committee member, <br>  <br>  We also have volunteers who travel to foreign lands (at their own expense) to help build kingdom halls and branch facilities. These are International servants. They are skilled construction workers, both male and female. They are also publishers, ministerial servants, elders, auxiliary pioneers, etc.<br>  <br>  Then we have state wide construction and disaster relief crews. These have overseers of different departments and skills. All who qualify have to be publishers but also can be pioneers, elders, ministerial servants, etc.<br>  <br>  So it isn't so much a "RANK" but what a person is capable of doing. Some obviously have more time, freedom, and financial independence than others. Everyone does what he can and appreciates the opportunity to use their talents or to be trained in a new skill to work at different levels and different locations.<br>  <br>  All of these are unpaid. Basic expenses are covered in some instances. Such as when I go to help build a kingdom hall, if I choose to stay at a hotel room, that is my expense, and the gas to get there. But the local congregations will provide the food for the three meals of the day.<br>  <br>  We all basically start as an unbaptized publisher and work toward baptism which opens up the many other very rewarding opportunities to volunteer.<br>  <br>  So a person can be a publisher, who is a pioneer, who is an elder, who works as an overseer/trainer in the bricklaying department of the kingdom hall building committee, and who is an assistant circuit overseer, all at the same time.<br>  <br>  As one noted, we do change designations as responsibilities are changed, divided or added. We no longer have Presiding Overseers. I believe two referred to that. Also "temporary" pioneer. That is from LONG ago.|`|AA10024451	There are no "ranks", and no clergy laity class distinctions.

deqX4oQQaa	I am non- denominational. Praise God Hallejulah!!! And in Jesus timing Praise His Holy Name ( Name above every name Philliapians 2:9-10 in KJV)<br>    9. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:<br>     10. That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.<br>    So in other words I am sold out to King of Kings and Lord of Lords ( Revelation 19:16) Mark 12:29-31, Matthew 22:37-40; Exodus 20; Deut.5 <br>    Plus I at moment in time do wear a silver cross around my neck with Jesus on a cross. I have not been convicted by Holy Spirit of God Himself to take it off.<br>    And it was given to me by a homeless man I was helping. In my way of thinking, at present, when I am out somewhere walking in a store etc... and someone who doesn't know Jesus see's it but we don't get a chance to talk, doesn't it give a witness of what King Jesus done for us around 2000 years ago to that person? Or anyone for that matter? I did not make the necklace it was a gift to me from a brother. I do not worship it I worship Jesus as my Risen savior.<br>    But please ponder this ( and pray about please) the serpent of brass in Numbers 21:2-9. <br>    Plus in the Greek idolatry is 1497 it states an image( i.e. for worship); by impl. a heathen god, or ( plur.) the worship of such:- - - idol. <br>   So King Jesus, the Father Jehovah Elohim, Yawhew, Adonia, Shalom, Nissi, Jireh, and the Holy Spirit of Almighty God is still # 1 in my life and especially in my heart. <br>    So I personally say don't be so quick to judge when you see something please keep open mind and find out from them why they are doing it. Matthew 7:1<br>     Please all have a blessed one! And if I don't see all true believers here on Earth see ya there in Heaven!!!

A couple of months later you hear about my "faith".<br>  All of a sudden, just like that you will hate me. <br>  Whether I do or do not have faith, I would never hate someone opposite of me for that reason. It's about attitude, actions and behavior. Not faith. Or race.<br>  I am not wanting to sound like a wise-@ss, but hate for faith and/or race reasons can make us all miss out on some pretty neat people.|`|eO9QCbdWaa	You are called a human. Humans hate. Every single one of us hates so to call you something would be calling me something so that makes me wonder what the point of this question is? Don't get me wrong, I'm not calling this question stupid or any such thing as that.  I'm wondering what made you ask it.  And I'm also wondering exactly why we hate people for being something before we actually know the person as an individual. For instance, racism against black people or Jews or "people of faith?" Or people who don't bathe regularly or poor people or people with brown hair or people who sing off tune............<br>  <br>  Personally, I hate it when people are just plain stupid. Really. I can be rather arrogant and I tend to look down my nose at people who I think are less mature than myself. But WHY do I do this? When I label someone as "stupid" I rarely ever give them a chance to show me who they really are. <br>  <br>  And the odd part is that I know this is wrong and I know when I am doing it and it is just about impossible for me to stop myself. I find it hilarious that so many people think that the world and people in general can become better just by pure will. I've tried it many times and it just doesn't work. Not that we shouldn't try. But what I mean is that I cannot treat other people kindly all day long and I seriously doubt that very many people could do it.<br>  <br>  This is the conundrum that boggled my mind constantly. Then I read Blue Like Jazz by Donald Miller. He spoke of how everyone needs to feel loved and this is why people hate.<br>  <br>  Let me explain further. Humans are insufficient sources for acceptance and love because we are human and have flaws. When one does not recieve love from another it makes them put up a wall. This happens over and over again in our lives every single day and this wall is the one that is called hate when it is really just fear and a need to be better than others because of this wall.<br>  <br>  People who are less mature than me scare me because they are so carefree and easy where I rarely am. So I use their "stupidity" to make myself feel better than them. Cause I sought out love and was rejected it by the carefree people because I am serious.

Some of what goes along with my faith in God. <br>  <br>  I don't want you to think that I answered this question to mock you by throwing this answer in your face and proclaiming "I am a Christian" cause that is SO not what I meant by this answer. I told you that I put my faith in God because I wonder if you hate me even now when you know that I think it's lovely that you aren't afraid to show this flaw and read things calling you horrible things that everyone is.<br>  <br>  I would like to add that even though I keep saying you and so on I realize that this was a hypothetical question.

YnGIccE8aa	Well inquirer, there is a book out there for Protestants called "100 Ways to Argue With Catholics" or some such thing. A few years back someone got me with that, quoting that book as though they themselves were asking me insightful questions. <br>  <br>  Here's what I discovered: the questions are all like this. Whomever wrote the book went through the Catechism cover-to-cover and refuted our teachings with the first paragraph on a certain aspect of faith or doctrine: only. If you look closely at the Catechism, it'll make a statement, sometimes bold, and then the next paragraph will say "Furthermore" and expound upon the idea. Just like what you quoted above. <br>  <br>  So if the poster who is doing these arguments comes up with 100 of these questions you'll know where they got it. Sadly, whoever reads "100 Ways to Argue with Catholics" doesn't realize the fullness of the Catechism, or the tolerance in our beliefs.<br>  <br>  To the poster who owns the Catechism and is not Catholic, and therefor doesn't understand it: The Catechism is not meant to be read cover-to-cover, it's meant to be reference or a go-to when something troubles us or we face a moral challenge and want to know what the church has to say on the subject. Nearly every aspect of a Christian's life is covered in that book, so if one has doubt or needs clarity -- they go to the index and look up the chapter pertaining to their question. Hope that helps!|`|d8czYNEKaa	No one has a monopoly on doing this. I think it often starts with someone who wants to try to make a point, even at the cost of presenting false or misleading information. Then, people take that and run with it, spreading it around to anyone else who won't dig deeper for the context. <br>  <br>  Bottom line is that this is not a "Protestant thing" and is done by misleading individuals caught up in the act of "bearing false witness," no matter their faith or denomination.|`|hvNqywbBaa	I agree with Tebone. <br>  Some do the same with Scripture.<br>  Others do whatever they can to bash the teaching of the Church.<br>  And still others are just ignorant.<br>  Also, not all Protestants act like her.|`|FjiRPKp2aa	Most protestants I know do not even know the Catechism of the Catholic church exists.|`|xZet9Dunaa	Most of these people are just anti-catholic|`|VFWRdAH3aa	good point.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	good point|`|04f345ca740404026090acf2b474e49caa	Probably because we never hear that quoted when someone asks how they ought to be saved and what they ought to do.  Its always become a member of the TRUE CHURCH.  Catholic statements are very egocentric.  <br>  <br>  That is a good clarifying quote.  However the words ought to be that we get our power derived from the fullness and grace of the GOSPEL. (good news)<br>  <br>  All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood God's grace in all its truth.  -Colossians 1:6<br>  <br>  One can have the church and be unsaved.  Once one has the Gospel, then they are saved.  It is dispensed through the Holy Spirit.  The church is only the cumination of our RESPONSE and SERVICE of faith not faith itself.  Power is entrusted to Christ alone.<br>  <br>  The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.  -John 1:14<br>  <br>  For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.  -John 1:17|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	No matter how many times you show them there ignorance they will always create another reason to hate the Body of Christ the Catholic Church as exhibited by some of the answers you've gotten so far.Like a teacher told me one time and that was Stupidity is usually a mental problem where as Ignorance is created stupidity.|`|38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	Because the individual you're quoting doesn't want to know anything about the Catholic Church and certainly not anything positive. He just wants to accuse us of everything from worshiping idols to condemning non-Catholics to Hell -- all without looking like a bigot himself.<br>  <br>  Funniest darned thing: some of us thought that he *might* not be terribly sincere because he was doing so much arguing with everyone who tried to tell him anything. And now he's pouting and being picked on by all us big mean idol-worshipin' pagan Kathlics.<br>  <br>  Awww. Poor thing.|`|nCU4mgbHaa	I want to think that it is from ignorance but sometimes I know it is to undermine the teaching of the Church and to turn others away from the fullness of faith the Church provides.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Some people prefer not to know the truth of what the Church teaches - they would have to give up their prejudices.|`|AA10034051	They do the same with the Holy Bible|`|LuN1unJ3aa	First, that would entail reading more than just the quoted section _and_ remembering it. In other words, they would have to make studying the Catechism as important as, say, studying the Bible.<br>  <br>  I have a copy of the Catechism and while I've done some searching in it, to be honest, there are sections where the translations are really bad, as if the person(s) doing the translating did not understand the English language. Furthermore, like the later creeds, I find confusion and contradiction. To me, while I find the Catechism a worthwhile reference tool, it is impossible _for me_ to read without getting frustrated. But then, I'm not Catholic, either.<br>  <br>  As to your question, this is a common tactic of critics everywhere: use sound bites (or in this case, isolated sentences) to denigrate those being quoted. It is part of scare-crow or straw-man building that goes on all the time.<br>  <br>  And it is a tool of the trade for those who claim to know more than those who actively live their religion.

Flutes are professional instruments, pretty complex and normally quite costly. Recorders are cheap plastic children's instruments. Maybe you could get some gift certificate for a music store so she can get a flute lower than the normal price, without you having to pay the full price.

RINM9TSQaa	It could be a possible possession of a vampire or werewolf type spirit. Some people have wolf spirit guides that allow them to mostly Mental shapeshift into them. What that is the wolf or any animal spirit guide will mentally take over allowing the person to feel like that animal,to have it's powers,sight,sense of smell,hearing,speed,strength,etc...  The book  The Magic Of Shapeshifting,by Rosalyn Greene explains it all-even physical shapeshifting and How To shapeshift. Vampire people say they do crave blood, i believe them because when I was 15yrs old I started craving blood. I didn't believe I was a vampire,in my belief vampires were fiction,I wasn't obsessed with them or watched or read many vamp books/movies. My blood hunger lasted until I was 29yrs old (I'm 36 now). I also found out that my canine teeth (top +bottom) did grow a little bit like fangs-NO B*llsh*t,I am deadly serious! Why I stopped craving blood is a mystery as much as why I started craving it, my canine teeth are still fang like.   Most likely I was possessed by a vampire spirit of some kind. Who knows,I'm not the gullible chicken little type person who looks up when acorns drop on my head and believe the sky is falling. I'm more of a debunker and cold hard facts type.

Ask why they dont like your friends. Get their side and point of view too. Don't complaing and whine to them, they wont listen.<br>  <br>  4) They dont like the Jonas Brothers and Im like, a huge fan of them<br>      Again ask why they don't like them. See if they have heard there lyrics or not, if not ask if you can show them a song and see if they like it... or give them a cd to listen to on the way to work or something.<br>  <br>  5)I smoke like ONE cigarette and they go ballistic!!!<br>      Dont smoke, it will ruin your lungs. So they have a point there, it's bad for you and you seem to be under the age limit so not only is it bad for you, it is illigal<br>  <br>  6) They hardly EVER let me play computer games its so annoying<br>       Again sit down and talk to them, they must have a good reason (not enought exercise?)<br>  <br>  So sometime soon, sit down and have a nice long talk. Pick a good time to talk with them, (not befor work or after a bad day) <br>  Sit down and ask if their day has been good, your is good, etc.<br>  Bring up your questions calmly, don't sound like a whiny kid, act mature. They will be way more likely to listen to you.<br>  Listen to their reasons after you ask them something, dont interrupt.<br>  Dont throw a fit when they say no, say you understand and make the best of it.<br>  <br>  Don't get in trouble, don't throw out threats to your parents (they will become more strict)<br>  <br>  Perhaps they want you to get a hobby, try out a sport, craft, collecting. <br>  And do your chores without them asking you to twice, they will apreciate this and maby give you more freedom.|`|k7973dtIaa	1.

Of course it would have to be done calmly and rationally.  <br>  <br>  If you want to know what to pray...ask God for patience, forgiveness and guidance.  <br>  <br>  I sometimes tell my kids that we are a gift to each other (I know it doesn't always seem that way).

"amicus" should be either "amico" or "amica" since "ab" requires the ablative case.  The gender is shown by "amico" (male) or "amica" (female).|`|MiDYJ8tMaa	Fuit = he/she/it was or he/she/it has been, depending on context - context that makes sense, that is. <br>  <br>  There are a couple of adverbs (mox, procul), but the rest is up for grabs.

DDFgKxcaaa	because even the bible writers knew god is imaginary|`|elVryMQUaa	It has to do with the origins of Judaism. It was originally a cult of one god in a pantheon of gods, the one the jews worshiped was called Yaweh. It was only later the cult only allowed worsphip of Yaweh and didn't allow worship of other gods. This is actually what killed polytheism. The polys accept there may be more than one path and allow people to have their own religions, while the monos, only allow one god, and say anyone who disagrees is going to hell, or they kill them in some cases.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	no it does not mean that<br>  <br>  <br>  he did in hebrew.<br>  Exodus 20:3-5<br>  In english you shall not worship any other thing called God but me only<br>  <br>  the next verse says not to make any thing with your hands and call it God.

He says that because he doesn't want you to follow gods that are not real. It is very hard to understand. Try reading the bible. He didn't say "I am the only God" because that's not how it was said back then. He is the only God. Also there are no other gods, and God does not hold greed. He is the only perfection in the world. Seriously try to read the bible it is very fascinating. There is no MOST about praising God. There is just him.|`|ckriDuxJaa	The bible is full of paridoxical statements.

The trinity isn't a biblical teaching, but is a teaching of Baal, one of the false gods just mentioned, and somehow, it's become mixed up with christianity. Congratulations, Dalton, you smart man, you! Keep asking questions.....|`|26DoxkOBaa	If you had kept it in context, then you'd know. <br>  The commandment reads: <br>  <br>  "I am the Lord thy God who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shall have no other gods before me. Thou shall not make unto thee any carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; Thou shall not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them"<br>  <br>  So it's talking about worshiping idols and statues like gods and getting sidetracked from the real and only God.|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	Monotheism in Judaism developed after a period of Henotheism.  YHWH was originally the tribal god of the Israelites, but was one god of many: one of the Elohim, the Ugritic pantheon of gods worshipped throughout the eastern Mediterranian 3500 years ago.  This is reflected in Genesis 1, where it's the Elohim who create the world.  Genesis 2 is a later variant, where YHWH has been given the central role.  In yet other early parts of the Bible YHWH is confused and combined with El-Yon, the chief god of the Ugritic pantheon.  By the time Exodus was witten, Judaism had made a transition to full monotheism, but the earlier henotheisitic phase was not forgotten.  That command is issued to resist any backsliding into henotheism.|`|AA10192697	There aren't other gods but men make them up. Like worshipping Zeus. Pagans were always making up gods. These gods were to answer their questions about rain, sun, moon, wind, water, storms, etc. And because these forces are powerful, the pagans made up great stories about the gods.<br>  <br>  We can also make money a god, sex a god, houses and boats gods. It also means that no one and no thing should come before Him.|`|Yz8Ysagiaa	He does not want anyone to praise or worship anything else. He does not want anything else to be viewed as a god.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	God knew there were other fake, evil, demonic gods made up throught the devil encouraged to be practiced and worshipped by humans. People also do create their own gods through physical ornaments and all sorts.<br>  <br>  Old Testament -Baal god, other pagan gods are mentioned in Bible. Revelation God said He is the Alpha and the Omega, He is the True God.|`|TOBYij3Qaa	we make fake gods, people worship their ipods and laptops or pleasure<br>  we dont see it much now, but people would create actual things to worship out of materials, it isnt God saying they are real, he is saying the worship of these things is wrong, if you look at al the Scripture, you will see where God also says he is the only God|`|8pQrIL90aa	Man is always inventing Gods, even boosting himself to the level of a deity. King Nebuchadnezzar did the same thing in the bible. God knows that men are going to create gods to live by, but we must know that there is only one. He says he is a jealous God, and why would a God gets jealous if he were not the only one? True God?|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	I can see how you might think that.  <br>  However,  I don't think your conclusion can be completely supported on this 1 verse, alone. I mean you COULD use that verse and possibly a handful of others to support that view,  However,  you'd be ignoring many OTHER verses which where he DOES say he is the only God that exists.  You'd ALSO be breaking with the long standing traditional interpretation of that verse and forming your own personal view that supports your ideas. <br>  <br>  The traditional interpretation of this verse is that God is talking about the belief and worship of other gods, besides him, separate from the reality of whether or not they exist. <br>  <br>  I can't come up with a perfect analogy off the top of my head, but it is SIMILAR to telling a kid.. "Don't believe in the tooth fairy, believe instead in your parents."  -- You are not saying,  "the tooth fairy exists, but it's better to think your parents put that money under your pillow"  NO,  you are talking about WHICH you should believe in.  The discussion of which is REAL and which is NOT,  is a separate matter.<br>  <br>  1 talks about an action (what to believe in) Your argument talks about what is REAL, which one truly exists. <br>  <br>  You PolyTheism (belief in many gods) was the predominant belief at that time.  The Jews were surrounded by PolyTheistic cultures, they traded with them,  were enslaved by them,  attacked by them,  Attacked THEM back, etc. etc.  Some of their servants and captives from war would have been from Polytheistic cultures. <br>  The OT details just HOW the Israelites struggled to keep their faith pure and how the belief in 1 God caused them issues.  Therefore this commandment was made to address THAT issue.<br>  <br>  _________________________<br>  <br>  Another traditional interpretation of this verse ALSO extends to ANYTHING which you worship above God.  This includes things like Money, Sexual Excesses, Greed, Power, Fame, Drugs, etc. etc.  Anything which we focuss on and make our "master" is putting that thing above God.  There are quite a few verses which talk about how other things can control us.  Even a PERSON can become our God if we focus soley on them OR allow what they say to take precedence over our following of God.|`|6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	No.  That is not what God said.  We call so many things god such as football, baseball, work, pleasure, etc.  Anything that you put before God is your god or goddess.  <br>  <br>  Isaiah 45:22<br>  "Look upon Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth:<br>  for I am God, and there is none else.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 45:22 "Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together:  who hath declared this fromm ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the Lord? and there is no God else beside Me; a just God and a Savior; there is none beside Me.<br>  <br>  Only One God and many false religions with idols and false gods and false goddesses.<br>  <br>  The true God is the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob whose Son is Jesus the Christ, Lord, Savior and God.|`|89MKzLl3aa	There are people who are pagan and believe in many gods.

8pQrIL90aa	Amen. Most believe they should be able to summon God as if they are bring forth a demon from the darkness, but we know that light shall overtake evil as they cannot dwell in the same place. Many believe that to ask difficult poisoned questions to Christian it will discredit the truth about the bible, or even shake the foundation of faith of the believer. God knows man, and he knows his heart and his motives, so that when he does reveal truth, it is for his glory not for the man's.<br>  <br>  God always uses the wickedness of men for his good to those who believe. We cannot help but be wicked, even when we seek to do good, we are wicked. But this is why the Lord lives. Yea the Lord sits upon the right hand of God, interceding for the sinful man, the lost man.

I was looking for someone to mug. I was not even thinking about stealing a truck, but as I walked down that street something pulled me toward that truck. When I reached inside, I realized the truck would start without a key. I got about one block before the cops got me. I was put on probation and I knew that if I ever got caught doing anything else, it would screw up my future. I've never done anything illegal since. I'm not saying that god exists, I'm saying that I believe in a higher power. Everyone has to decide for themselves what their life experiences mean to them. Maybe the higher power is the energy that started everything and maybe what happened to me was just a coincident? All I know is that I had no reason to go near that truck and what are the odds of it starting without a key?|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Okay, that makes zero sense.<br>  <br>  If, as you propose, God already knows what it would take to convince me of his existence and the need to serve him in order to guarantee my salvation, and he CHOOSES not to provide that evidence to me, exactly who is to blame when I remain unconvinced of his existence?<br>  <br>  And incidentally: It's not "arrogant" to insist on evidence before we'll take you or your god seriously.  It's called "justifiable skepticism" -- you should TRY it sometime...|`|AA11989753	"...God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble." <br>  1 Peter 5:5<br>  <br>  But he giveth more grace.

IF it is just the Pastor I would seek an alternative Church then. If it is the faith then I would explore others similar to your beliefs at least but it sounds like it is the first just the Pastor so I would go to another Church if you can.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	You must bring it up before the board and then if the board does not see it your way you must decide if you are wrong or not and then choose.  But, I would say that if you have set yourself against him he cannot function as your Pastor and you should leave, but do not be afraid to bring his deed to light, just make sure you do it Biblically.  <br>  <br>  Now, if he manages her estate and brings in money why would she not lavish him with gifts for what she cannot do?  Does he manage it faithfully?  Are you sure you have an accurate picture of what is going on?  Look at Joseph and Daniel they were stewards of the King and they were second to the King himself and the king did not care how they spent his money as long as the kingdom thrived.

It's definitely wrong what your pastor is doing and I wouldn't want him guiding me.|`|elVryMQUaa	I say, you don't go to church at all, of course that's just my not so humble opinion|`|mm4KaxAjaa	confront it if your a member of anything|`|XwuZYLg1aa	Your statement about your preacher sounds like he needs help.  What you claim he is doing is a crime and should be stopped. Have you or any other member talked with the older lady or her family if she has any?  They may be able to put a stop to it.<br>  <br>  The things you say this man is doing shows that he is not following the book he claims to preach from.  Romans 12 and Philippians 2 teach us to look out for the other before our self.  Jesus says the same thing in a number of passages.  <br>  <br>  I would bring evidence to the church leaders and ask them to help in changing the preacher's actions or if he will not change changing preachers.  If you hit a dead end going that direction, you may consider finding a new place to worship.  You do not have to tell you children why you left, unless you feel they are old enough to understand.
AA11476749	The dead were in Hades (the abode of the dead).  Hades had two parts, Abraham's Bosom (aka Paradise) and a place of torment.  <br>  <br>  We see this in Jesus' story of Lazarus and the rich man.  (Cf. Luke 16)<br>  <br>  After Jesus went to Paradise following His crucifixion, He preached to the dead there, and took with Him to Heaven the righteous dead.  (Cf. 1 Peter 3:19 and Ephesians 4:8)<br>  <br>  At the last Judgment, those unrighteous dead who are being tormented in Hades (Cf. 2 Peter 2:9) will be taken before the Great White Throne, where they will be condemned to the Lake of Fire.

I will try to keep this short.  From a Biblical Judaeo/Christian perspective the answer is simple.  Obedience to God gave one assurance of salvation.  If you read through the OT you find the devout had a personal relationship with God up to the point Moses was given the law and the sacrificial system.  You could argue it had been in place since Cain and Able but it was more for worship than forgiveness.  You could still have a relationship with God, but the Priest became the mediator and the sacrifice the method.  I personally believe that this is still in affect for those that have never heard the Good News.|`|a085260e18048091431aa093b935186faa	Before Christ there was only the Law. people were judged on the law and either found guilty or innocent.|`|AA11220299	A lot is revealed to us from the story Christ told about the Rich Man and Lazarus. There is a place called Hades and it is divided into two sections, one section called Sheol and the other section called Paradise. Before Christ atoned for sin everyone who died went to hades, the righteous to Paradise and the wicked to Sheol. When Christ died he also went there, and three days later when He rose, He took with Him all the people in Paradise to Heaven with Him. The unrighteous still remain there and will until the judgment when they will be judged and sent to hell as their final place.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	Before christianity, there were other religions, each with its own version of afterlife myth that people believed with their whole hearts to be true, just as you believe in your religion.|`|JTD3M8Ziaa	They decomposed, just like we do today.|`|dai4nP0yaa	Well Achilles told Odyseus he would rather be a lowly work man but alive than be dead. And that was long before christ, so i figure he didn't find it very pleasant. If you were greek, you were escorted by Hermes across the Stix to Hades and stayed there as a shade. <br>  <br>  If you were ancient egyptian Anubis weighed your heart against a feather on his scales. If your heart was lighter, you recieved eternal life, otherwise the demon Ammit ate your heart. <br>  <br>  If you were Norse and died in battle you had a 50-50 chance of going to Odin or to Feryja, half those who died in battle went to the halls of Valhalla and ate and drank waiting for Ragnarok, the other half went to  Fólkvangr (Freyja's domain) again more drinking and eating. Those who didn't die in battle apparently went to Hel (not to be confused with hell).  Apparently there was also a place called Helgafjell were the dead continued to live as they had lived in life. <br>  <br>  Many African religions had the dead live together with their families and act as protectors as long as they were happy. However should the family displease them or fail to make the correct sacrifices, the dead would usually turn the family until amends were made.<br>  <br>  Buddhism and Hinduism have re-incarnation.<br>  <br>  Many religions had the souls of the dead returning to mother earth to be reborn at some later unspecified date. <br>  <br>  A few people simply died and that was that. I guess it depends alot on what you believe. I mean after all god is love and he would never simply send people to hell (or even let them go there) simply because they were born too early.

What mankind needed was a redeemer to make a sacrifice once and for all time. That is why we have Jesus. There is only one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity—the man Christ Jesus. He gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone. He personally carried our sins in his body so that we can be dead to sin and live for what is right. By his wounds you are healed.<br>  "For God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.

Would you like him to find out about it from some complete stranger, or someone else besides you, or from you?<br>  <br>  You never know what will happen unless you try it.

Meaning he did not have the same belief that you do.  You believe in God but your husband does not so what you're doing is turning your back on God because you want to keep the peace in your household. You're not introducing your child to the Lord, or giving the child the values that were passed down to you... not becuase you don't believe them but because you're husband is an athiest.  If you don't take a stand soon, your child could end up being an athiest as well.  You will answer to that when you stand before God. Deep I know, but it's the truth. You really need to decide how much peace you want in your home. If you deny Christ, he'll deny you - he's not going to care that you didn't want to "rock the boat" in your home - all he's going to care about is that you denied him.......you don't want him to say "depart from me, I don't know you".   You need to let your husband know what you really believe and pray he accepts christ for himself.  <br>  <br>  I could say a ton of stuff here but I'm going to say this........No Jesus- No peace.  Know Jesus- Know peace.|`|LGvwl67waa	Your first duty as a parent is to establish your authority as the only caretaker of your child.<br>  <br>  Your father is questioning this... It's time for daddy to realize you're not a little girl anymore and that you can raise your children right without his guidance.<br>  <br>  The fact that he mentioned your sister demonstrates that he's still "scolding" you.<br>  <br>  It's a generational issue that isn't different just because it's about religion. If it were 1 or 2 generations ago, your father might be scolding you for not using the "strap" to discipline your child. He could be scolding you about making her wear pants or how you potty-trained her.<br>  <br>  Don't feel bad, but sit down with your dad and make things clear that you're in charge of the education. He can make suggestions, but he can't force you to do anything.<br>  <br>  You could try to calm his fears of her not learning the "right" values and explain to him how you plan to teach her about morals and values, how you plan to talk to her about religion eventually (she will, eventually, unless you put her in a plastic bubble) and how you plan to let her make her own choices about religion when she's old enough.<br>  <br>  These discussions rarely take more than 1/2 hour. You can talk with him around coffee while your husband is in the other room or even do it on the phone (though that would be delicate).<br>  <br>  If you really don't feel comfortable, ask your mom how to talk to him... I know they're divorced, but I'm sure she has 1 or 2 tips to approach him with a touchy subject.|`|Of0H9i4Vaa	What the Bible really teaches...Stress is laid on preserving a marriage even if only one mate is a believer. Paul wrote: “If any brother has an?unbelieving?wife, and yet she is agreeable to dwelling with him, let him not leave her; and a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and yet he is agreeable to dwelling with her, let her not leave her husband. .?.?. But if the unbelieving one proceeds to depart, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not in servitude under such circumstances, but God has called you to peace. For, wife, how do you know but that you will save your husband? Or, husband, how do you know but that you will save your wife?” (1?Corinthians 7:12-16) If the unbeliever chooses to depart, the Christian will let him go. But the believer, hoping that the unbeliever may be won over to Christianity, will not initiate the breakup. Timothy’s mother, Eunice, apparently stayed with her unbelieving husband but imparted spiritual instruction to her son.—2?Timothy 1:5; 3:14,?15.<br>  <br>  The apostle Paul’s words: “To the married people I give instructions, yet not I but the Lord, that a wife should not depart from her husband; but if she should actually depart, let her remain unmarried or else make up again with her husband; and a husband should not leave his wife.” (1?Corinthians 7:10,?11) Christian mates should be able to settle their problems, making allowances for human imperfection. No problem should be so great that it cannot be resolved by praying earnestly, applying Bible principles, and showing the love that is a fruit of God’s spirit.—Galatians 5:22; 1?Corinthians 13:4-8.<br>  <br>  When you get married you for sake all others this includes your dad.<br>  <br>  The head of the woman is the man...The head of the man Is the Christ (Jesus)  The head of Jesus is God (Jehovah)...<br>  <br>  Jesus says at John 17:3  This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you(Jehovah), the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ. read verses 6,25,26<br>  <br>  The answer Jesus gave has tremendous importance for us today. In his reply, he summed up what always was and always will be the essence of true worship. Quoting from Deuteronomy 6:5, Jesus said: “‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’ This is the greatest and first commandment.” Though the Pharisee asked for just one commandment, Jesus gave him another. Quoting from Leviticus 19:18, he said: “The second, like it, is this, ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’” Jesus then indicated that these two laws embraced the whole of pure worship. Forestalling any attempt to get him to list in order of importance the other laws, he concluded: “On these two commandments the whole Law hangs, and the Prophets.” (Matthew 22:37-40) In this article, we will consider the greatest of these two commandments. Why must we love God? How do we show that we do? And how can we develop such love? It is vital to know the answers to these questions, for to please Jehovah, we must love him with all our heart, soul, and mind.|`|kPKKyZluaa	As long as you believe and have that time to your self and God it's okay not to go to a building to worship him.

If your really wanting to attend church then you should go, and explain to your husband that your going, and that you'll also not try pushing anything they say onto him, that basically you'll not discuss the happenings at church unless he wants to hear it.

You said yourself your mom doesn't judge you well she might want you to follow along and go to church. Even though she isn't as religious she still believes in God. It also helps in life going to church. You feel free of your rid dens and sin from the week. Just Try That's all.
JTrWRUBiaa	I'm not a creationist, but I've decided to answer anyways.<br>  <br>  I believe that it is because many people who reject evolution don’t actually understand what it is. They’ve been taught a cartoonish straw-man version of evolution that is easy to debunk. They don’t know it’s a straw-man version though; they think it’s the real deal.<br>  <br>  As you look at the data for increasing education, you’re going to see several things happening. (Note: These are my thoughts and may not be 100% accurate.)<br>  1) People who make it that far are more likely to accept evolution in the first place. They have less qualms with evolution to begin with and are more likely to go on to higher learning in a science related field. (As opposed to some creationists who actually think negative thoughts about science.)<br>  2) Some people who started as creationists may learn what the theory of evolution is actually about, and then accept it. (Possibly combined with the rejection of their former religion, or possibly with the realization that evolution doesn’t really contradict religious belief outright.)<br>  <br>  The more educated someone is about evolution, the higher the chances are that they accept it. It’s harder to reject it when you’re learning the real deal.|`|P1Sl55Coaa	No, it's because they try so hard to indoctrinate people in college.  If you are a strong christian with a background in apologetics, that won't happen to you.  Or you could attend a christian college that tells you the truth, not the lies that they try to spread at the secular universities.  Many teachers went into education just so they could try to force people to forget about their religious beliefs.  That's why they fight so hard to keep any "religion," other than their own, out of government schools.  You see, if a teacher could show them the other side, the truth, they would not be able to indoctrinate them into the religion of secular humanism so easily.  It's pretty tough for a kid to fight everyone, especially people in authority over them, if nobody on their side is able to speak.  Doesn't that sound like totalitarianism to you?  Most of the best Universities were started as seminaries.  Now, religious speech is repressed.  Why do you have to keep christians quiet?  What are you guys afraid of?|`|5e799354246f46f978ee61e21bdd3ea9aa	Richard Dawkins goes into depth about this in "The God Delusion". Apparently, children intuitively trust the word of those with authority ie. parents and in this case church leaders. It helped us survive when we are young by recognising when we are threatened...Dad sees danger, tells kid to run, kid runs. So when your church leader keeps telling you the world and everything in it was made in 6 days, you believe him/her (most likely him). The older we get the more we question this absurd notion I assume.<br>  <br>  Notice however, that the level of rejection, which would represent dyed-in-the-wool Christians I assume, stays relatively the same save the post grad stat....|`|NrjGBiV2aa	Because education leads to realization|`|cpOtr6Thaa	Schools offer only one theory.

It's a word we use to describe the nature of God.  Consider these Bible verses:<br>  <br>  ...The LORD our God, the LORD is one.  Deuteronomy 6:4.  The word "one" is from the Hebrew word echad which means "complex one".  <br>  <br>  Another Biblical use of echad is...<br>  <br>  ...cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes... Numbers 13:23.  There is only one cluster of grapes, but there are many grapes.  <br>  <br>  "Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness..." Genesis 1:26  Again, this is plural.  <br>  <br>  Doctor Luke wrote that when the angel talked to Mary, he said,<br>  "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God." Luke 1:35<br>  <br>  Later when Jesus was baptized,<br>  "As soon as Jesus ws baptized, he went up out of the water.  At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the SPIRIT of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.  And a voice from heaven (FATHER) said, "This is my SON, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."<br>  <br>  Here are three attempts at explaining the tri-oneness of the Lord Yahweh.<br>  <br>  1. The egg: each egg has a shell, a white, and a yolk; three distinct parts, but only one egg.<br>  <br>  2. Dimension: A box has height, width, and length.  They are not the same, cannot be separated, nor are they "parts."  The concept of space is meaningless without all three.<br>  <br>  3.

(Mark 14:41,?62) And Daniel goes on to say: “His rulership is an indefinitely lasting rulership that will not pass away, and his kingdom one that will not be brought to ruin.”—Daniel 7:13,?14.<br>  However, it is important to note here in the book of Daniel that the “son of man” is not to rule alone. The Bible says: “And the kingdom and the rulership .?.?. were given to the people who are the holy ones of the Supreme One. Their kingdom is an indefinitely lasting kingdom.” (Daniel 7:27) These expressions “the people” and “their kingdom” let us know that others will rule with Christ in God’s government. On the last night that Jesus spent with his faithful 11 apostles he showed that they would be rulers with him in God’s kingdom. He told them: “You are the ones that have stuck with me in my trials; and I make a covenant with you, just as my Father has made a covenant with me, for a kingdom.” (Luke 22:28,?29) Later, the apostle Paul and Timothy were included in this covenant, or agreement, for a kingdom. For that reason Paul wrote Timothy: “If we go on enduring, we shall also rule together as kings.” (2?Timothy 2:12) Also, the apostle John wrote of those who will “rule as kings over the earth” along with Jesus Christ.—Revelation 5:9,?10; 20:6. So those who go to heaven go there to serve as joint rulers with Christ in God’s heavenly government. While Jesus is the main “seed” of promise, God chooses others from among humankind to rule with Jesus in the kingdom. They thus become part of the “seed,” as the Bible says: “If you belong to Christ, you are really Abraham’s seed, heirs with reference to a promise.”—Galatians 3:16,?29; James 2:5.<br>  HOW MANY GO TO HEAVEN?---Jesus told his disciples: “Have no fear, little flock, because your Father has approved of giving you the kingdom.”—Luke 12:32. How small a number will that class of Kingdom rulers be? Will it include only the apostles and other early followers of Jesus? No, the Bible shows that the “little flock” will include more. At Revelation 14:1,?3 the Bible says: “And I saw, and, look! the Lamb [Jesus Christ] standing upon the [heavenly] Mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand .?.?. who have been bought [or, taken] from the earth.” Note that only 144,000 persons are seen with the Lamb, Jesus Christ, on heavenly Mount Zion. (Hebrews 12:22) So rather than all good people going to heaven, the Bible reveals that only 144,000 tried and faithful persons will be taken there to rule with Christ.<br>  WHY CHOSEN FROM THE EARTH---But why does God choose these rulers from among humankind? Why not have angels rule with Christ? Well, it was here at the earth that Jehovah’s right to rule was challenged. It was here that the faithfulness of men to God could be put to the test under opposition from the Devil. It was here that Jesus proved his full loyalty to God under test and gave his life as a ransom for mankind. So it was from the earth that Jehovah arranged to take a “little flock” of persons to be associated with his Son in the heavenly kingdom. They are the ones who, by their faithfulness to God, proved false the Devil’s charge that men serve God only for selfish reasons. It is fitting, therefore, that Jehovah uses these humans for his glory.—Ephesians 1:9-12. Also, think how wonderful it will be to have as rulers persons who proved faithful to God on earth, many of them even sacrificing their lives in behalf of the Kingdom. (Revelation 12:10,?11; 20:4) Angels have not faced such kind of testings. Nor have they experienced the problems common to humankind. So they would not fully understand what it is like to be a sinful human and to have the problems we humans do. But the 144,000 will understand because they have had these very problems. Some of them have had to overcome very sinful practices, and they know how hard it can be to do so. (1?Corinthians 6:9-11) Therefore, they will deal with their earthly subjects in an understanding way.—Hebrews 2:17,?18.<br>  THE NEW THING IN GOD’S PURPOSE---Jehovah God did not change his purpose for the earth and mankind on it after Adam started the human race down the path of sin and death. Had God done so, it would have meant that he was not able to carry out his original purpose. His purpose from the beginning was to have an earth-wide paradise filled with happy, healthy people, and that purpose still stands. The only new thing that God introduced was his arrangement for a new government to carry out his purpose. As we have seen, his Son, Jesus Christ, is the main ruler in this government, and 144,000 persons will be taken from among humankind to rule in heaven with him.—Revelation 7:4.<br>  These rulers in heaven will make up the “new heavens” of God’s new system. Yet it is clear that if there are to be such righteous rulers over the earth, th

AA11097612	I find it peculiar that your deficit every month is equal to your tithe.  It seems too coincidental.  But there could be a few reasons for this.  Having said this here are my thoughts.  Tithing is not for God.  Tithing is for us.  In the book of Malachi it says "Will a man rob me?  Yet you say, how have we robbed you... bring in the whole tithe and see if I do not open the flood gates of heaven to pour out blessings upon you."  It is trusting that God will meet your needs not depending on your own strength and wisdom which often fails.  <br>  <br>  You don't have to tithe.  It is not what determines your salvation.  But not tithing will restrict the blessings God would have for you because of your lack of faith.  Choose wisely.|`|2d2ZuimCaa	It sounds like  your not really trusting in the Lord that he will meet your needs.

Proverbs 3:5  "Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.<br>  6  In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths."  <a href="http://www.fbbc.com/messages/one_step/one_step_09.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbbc.com/messages/one_step/on...</a>|`|AA10471892	The biblical tithe was an old covenant requirement. The old covenant was a "contract" between the two parties, God and Israel. Christians were never a party to that covenant, and that covenant ended upon the death of Jesus Christ on the cross, seeing as Jesus is identified as the God of the old covenant/testament. Covenants end upon the death of either party to a covenant, as explained by the apostle Paul in Romans chapter 7, where he uses a marriage covenant to explain this.<br>  <br>  A tithe was the tenth of the increase of produce and livestock. No one was ever commanded to tithe on their wages. Only land owners who had livestock and crops tithed.<br>  <br>  Old covenant points of law were not to come forward into the new covenant. To do so was described as being a subversion of the Christian’s soul as brought out in Acts 15.<br>  <br>  A Christian’s giving to a ministry or church was never to be compulsory. Only through free will offerings were ministers supported. Paul, in I Corinthians 9, makes his case that those who preached the gospel were to live of the gospel. Paul did not use tithing as a means of justifying support. Rather, Paul used the example of not muzzling the ox that treads out the grain as justification.<br>  <br>  Why then would a ministry teach compulsory tithing of wages? <br>  <br>  Jesus warned his followers that there would come religious leaders who would declare rightly He was the Christ, then proceed to deceive people. These deceivers are also described as being deceived themselves, as well as being wolves in sheep’s clothing who do not spare the flock. Tithing serves this perfectly. Most people do not understand what a tithe really is, and most people do not understand the covenants and the difference between the old and the new. The deceivers take advantage of people’s ignorance regarding the law and a Christian’s relationship with God. The one that teaches tithing paints a picture of a God that demands they tithe. To neglect to tithe is seen as being disobedient to God; robbing God. To tithe is seen as being pleasing to God, and that God will bless those who do so. Tithing is therefore put forth as being a matter of faith when in actuality tithing has nothing to do with faith. Paul states in his writings that the law is not of faith. You don’t see these ministers who propound tithing living by faith that God will support them through the free_will offerings of their flocks.<br>  <br>  It is not uncommon for ministers and lay people alike to offer up justifications when they alter Scripture and the application of Scripture. But there is never a justification for taking the very inspired word of God and altering it so suit one’s "needs" or the "changing times." The old covenant was designed with Israel in mind and their economy. To try and force-fit tithing into another culture and another time is unwarranted. You cannot put the new wine (new covenant) into the old wineskin (old covenant).<br>  <br>  So what happens when one tithes, but they are not blessed financially? What is concluded if they experience further financial difficulties? It is their fault. They are lacking in faith. It is a no win situation for the poor person who was convinced by their ministry they have to tithe in order to be blessed by God.<br>  <br>  So ingrained is tithing now in the Christian psyche that there are few who are willing to truly step out in faith and abandon old covenant points of law that bring people back under the bondage of that law. (Galatians 5:1) A Christian lives by the law of faith, also known as the law of liberty. It is a law where one is freed from the obligations of the old covenant letter of the law.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	one would have to see your expense line and what you call bare minimum.  if she is feeling the need to tithe her 10% then that is the $600 a month and you're living on $6000 a month.....   sorry but i can't see how that is the bare minimum.  is she is going over board than you can either tithe less or only your 10% abd give of your time in place of the extra monies.|`|z74a7wvlaa	Be reasonable in the circumstance also means love; tough love.<br>  It is therefore reasonable to downsize the tithing; the 10% does not means literal 10% - an amount reasonable.

Race or color makes no difference if you feel good about yourself no matter who you are or what your heritage is you are going to look attractive to others. It a matter of your self esteem and accepting yourself and others for who they are. Beauty inside is the real advantage and what counts all over the world. You have spent and will continue spending so much time on comparing yourself to others and others of different races. Please just love yourself and you won't have to feel this way and it won't even be on your mind. Looks are superficial they don't show the human being that is inside. The most beautiful person can be the most horrible inside.|`|xy2yoALcaa	those kids look like mexicans <br>  <br>  or like there mixed with black and white but little asian<br>  <br>  these kids dont get a race we'll just call them confused|`|pfke6Jieaa	those kids must have east indian blood in them. if u ever search up burma u will see that the burmese also look like that. mostly the ones with the sharper features come from middle eastern or south asian influence, especially during the islamic movement. the muslims they move into all over east and southeast asia. <br>  <br>  caucasian blood isnt that common in east asia because there would be a big number of eurasian looking ppl coming from that area. but if u notice a lot of asian actors sometimes have asian features but except they have higher nose bridge, deeper eyes, and also stronger jaw line. that is the typical features for mixture with middle eastern. they also are somewhat taller too and not average height.|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	They sure look caucasian influenced to me..|`|jG7ejIZvaa	They don't look asian at all.|`|T1beLIQqaa	According to a recent Stanford genetic study, the Southeast Asian population is far from being homogeneous. Although primarily descendants of Austronesian, Tai, and Mon-Khmer-speaking immigrants who migrated from Southern China during the Bronze Age and Iron Age, there are overlays of Arab, Chinese, Indian, Polynesian and Melanesian genes.<br>  <br>  There are also large pockets of intermarriage between indigenous Southeast Asians and those of Chinese descent. They form a substantial part of everyday life in countries such as Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines. Indonesia and Malaysia also has a few mixed Southeast Asian-Chinese populations.<br>  <br>  On the mainland the Khmer peoples of Cambodia remain as ancestors of earlier Pareoean peoples. Similarly, remnants of the Mon group are found in parts of Myanmar and Thailand; the ethnic mixture there has been produced by overlaying Tibeto-Burman and Tai, Lao, and Shan peoples. The contemporary Vietnamese population originated from the Red River area in the north and may be a mixture of Tai and Malay peoples. Added to these major ethnic groups are such less numerous peoples as the Karens, Chins, and Nagas in Myanmar, who have affinities with other Asiatic peoples. Insular Southeast Asia contains a mixture of descendants of Proto-Malay (Nesiot) and Pareoean peoples who were influenced by Malayo-Polynesian and other groups. In addition, Arabic(Semitic White), Indian(from India-Indo European Aryan White-the Tamils), and Chinese influences have affected the ethnic pattern of the islands.<br>  <br>  In modern times the Burmans account for more than two-thirds of the ethnic stock of Myanmar, while ethnic Thais and Vietnamese account for about four-fifths of the respective populations of those countries. Indonesia is clearly dominated by the Javanese and Sundanese ethnic groups, while Malaysia is more evenly split between the Malays and the Chinese. Within the Philippines, the Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano, and Bicol groups are significant.These include the Negritos(Asians with reduced Black features, NO Black heritage/DNA).-Wikipedia|`|KFch4IZ4aa	I know eh, they look mixed, but not all east asians like that, like chinese japanese and all that have like different features than these kids in the pics.

It sort of falls in that category of "the end justifies the means"  which of course it can't.

05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	In the USA, Unitarians have been Unitarian Universalists since 1961. People often drop the Universalist the way they dropped "Roebuck" from "Sears, Roebuck" before Sears just stopped trying and became plain "Sears'.<br>  <br>  UUs are not Christian. We are the church of last resort for some people - Agnostics, Atheists, Deists and Theists - who, while they don't fit in a normal church, want to explore spiritual issues, socialize with like-minded people and work for social justice as part of a group. We are the church many people turn to if they have a mixed marriage and want to attend a church together. Our small (160 people) congregation has two Jewish+Christian couples and one Buddhist+Christian. We used to be the only church around for GLBT people, but that is slowly changing.<br>  <br>  We're still the most tolerant church around; some people are UUs for that reason.<br>  <br>  Christianity has three main branches, Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant. They all believe in the father, son, holy spirit. The Protestants split off from the Catholics starting with Martin Luther. Orthodox are the Greek and Russian folks with the icons whose preists have big square beards. (I'm simplifying tremendously here.) Catholics are the ones with the Pope. The best-known are the Roman Catholics, but there are others. <br>  <br>  In the USA, Protestants include Methodists, Presbyterians, Lutherans, and Baptists. Those are the best-known, but my list isn't complete by any means. Episcopalians and Amish are both Protestant, although there are some differences in their services and what their ministers wear.<br>  <br>  The UUs would be happy to have you, but you'd probably be more comfortable in a liberal protestant church. Pick one with a large [youth / singles / young parents / senior] group, depending on your age and inclination. Ask the minister about the holy spirit, He/she can explain it.<br>  <br>  =================================<br>  <br>  "Cult" means a religious group that is<br>  1) small, <br>  2) new<br>  3) Has a single leader and <br>  4) a single mindset, <br>  if you look it up in the dictionary. <br>  It has to have all four. One of your answerers defines "cult" as any religion, and another defines us as one based on our being small, I guess; maybe because we are not Christian. One out of four doesn't count. There are lots of  small denominations.<br>  <br>  A third answerer neglected the Orthodox branch of Christianity.

Life (the physical part of which can be described as an incredibly complex series of chemical reactions) came out of the complex chemical reactions in the primordial sea.  The same holds for the universe - the big bang theory describes how the universe came from an incredibly dense point of matter... not nothing!<br>  <br>  In both cases, the science doesn't show something coming from nothing, but rather something coming from "something that was very different."  (And Chas Chas is wrong - not a single scientific law is violated in these theories... otherwise they wouldn't be scientific theories!)<br>  <br>  It's not necessarily easier to understand.  If anything, it's quite a bit more complex than "God did it, that's the end of it, and you'll be punished if you ask questions."

But this is very hard to believe for an atheist! <br>  <br>  An atheist will believe in literally anything rather than acknowledge his creator.

Learn to seperate Science and Religion. Just wrote: Scientifically, according to research, Evolution exist. You don't have to say you believe, just say that it's a real existing scientific theory.<br>  Theory is not a believe, it's a resolution of years of research, night of endless non-sleep by scientist who studied for years and years - many of which are Christians who believe that God created a world we can discover and is thus beautiful because God make it logical. <br>  You can say you believe in less than a second, those people proof or question what they believe through years of research.<br>  You don't have to believe it, but at least respect it by saying that "Yes, data and research says so." <br>  You, my dear, need to look into Einstein and other Christian Scientist.|`|S48X1XaHaa	you could answer it by saying for example if they ask: what is evolution? you could answer it by saying it is a THEORY which is true, or if it asks something else about main beliefs or evidence, you could say SOME PEOPLE believe that the evolution of the horse proves this theory..etc etc. <br>  <br>  Stay nuetral on it as well as answering the question.

He was probably mostly poor through out his life.<br>  <br>  My guess is that they put the gifts away and used them over the years to help raise Jesus. <br>  <br>  Remember, after Jesus' birth, they could not go home because they were threatened by Herod. They had to leave their home in Galilee and flee to Egypt. They probably used some of the gifts to start over. Then after Herod died, they moved back to Galilee-- another start.|`|d69d49545272c36ef0603d8151da8422aa	Carpenters of Joseph' time were not poor at all, but were more likely upper middle income, at least.<br>  <br>  This is why there is much speculation that Jesus traveled to the orient to study during the 'missing' years.<br>  <br>  Joseph was not likely even close to being poor.|`|GItBUBL9aa	Nothing is recorded regarding what was done with those gifts.  You explained the Frankincense and Myrrh, the gold was a kingly gift.  Perhaps the gold was helpful for Joseph and Mary resettling and traveling to Egypt.  All those things had monetary value.|`|FFqWeIX7aa	they use it or sold it...<br>  just like another ordinary stuff though...|`|XBI9ekydaa	Joe sold off the gifts and used all of the money to buy cheap wine.|`|NrjGBiV2aa	They were like, stuff|`|KntBP2Zmaa	and you believe someone on Yahoo R&S knows?|`|3a9f326d01ff48571ab8b07403c16d21aa	Those gifts were God's child support for Jesus.

One of the best sources for information was documented by Dr. Raymond Moody in his book, "Life After Life" which is available on Amazon and may be in your local public library.<br>  <br>  Whether those who have experienced the phenomenon actually believed they were in heaven or hell is likely to be dependent upon the individual and their concepts of those places.<br>  <br>  Not long after the book came out, I attended a meeting led by the head doctor of our local hospital's emergency department. He indicated that in any group of so many people, there would be at least one who had gone through the experience and asked (since the group was big enough) if any had experienced it. One raised his hand (he happened to be my barber).<br>  <br>  It is interesting that many (most?) of those who have had such an experience do not go around advertising it.

In science a theory is something that has accrued a lot of supportive data.<br>  <br>  See these two definitions from scientific usage:<br>  <br>  "Some scientific explanations are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them. The explanation becomes a scientific theory. In everyday language a theory means a hunch or speculation. Not so in science. In science, the word theory refers to a comprehensive explanation of an important feature of nature supported by facts gathered over time. Theories also allow scientists to make predictions about as yet unobserved phenomena."<br>  <br>  "A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not "guesses" but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than "just a theory." It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress. But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact."<br>  <br>  God is more like a hypothesis in scientific terms and one that has yet to attain any good supportive data in an objective, positive sense. You would also need to define god precisely in order to discuss the relative claims and their plausibilty. Humans have come up with so many different god concepts.|`|b1233d2957b6685f6644485ce17a6f62aa	No.  Evolution theory is not "just" a theory.  You are using the definition of "theory" as "speculation".  Biologists use this definition: "a plausible or scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena". <br>  <br>  God is not a theory.  It's religious dogma, and people believe in religion even when there is evidence to the contrary.|`|2zd9OjeMaa	Nope. Evolution is a theory because it has loads of evidence that supports it, is disprovable and makes accurate predictions. God existing is at best a hypothesis because it has none of the above.|`|1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	In a general sense, yes...<br>  <br>  But evolution involves science and can be supported by experiment and observation.<br>  <br>  God on the other hand involves religion and cannot be tested or observed scientifically.  He lies in the realm of faith and belief.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	So is your alleged intelligence.<br>  <br>  Of the 3, I find only evolution has any evidence.|`|V8Lyc2Jlaa	True, both are theories. Only difference, one has facts to prove it, the other has epic novels.|`|AA11220299	Certainly, but that is insignificant. The important thing is which is truth.|`|URO3gDXcaa	yes they are.  but evolution has more evidence to suggest it is more than a theory.|`|hmU2udmRaa	in order to be a theory in the scientific sense, one should be able to form accurate predictions based on the theory.  this is why evolution is accepted as a theory and god is not.  unless you can give me a prediction that can be verified in a scientific experiment, it is not a theory.|`|0NOiAlJOaa	Evolution is ONLY a theory. Although, Satan would have you believing otherwise. But, I'm sorry to say.....according to the vast majority of mankind, who are, in this age and time, spiritually discerned, and made ignorant of God's Spiritual Truth through the influence of Satan, the father of lies. Creationism is, and will always remain to be..........only a "theory" until the return of  Jesus Christ.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	a "theory" is a testable hypothesis. Evolution has stood up to testing, can be observable in the lab setting, and fits all known evidence. God is not testable, therefore God is not a theory. But you are right about your second point, God and evolution are not mutually exclusive. In fact one could view the garden of Eden story as being symbolic of evolution: one could view Adam as a proto-human primate, Eden as the bliss of ignorance, and the "tree of knowledge" as being the evolution into a more advanced understanding of the world and thus being cast out of ignorance into a full understanding of death and a capability for true melancholy.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	Sure, loosely defined. However, one has heaping mounds of physical evidence to give it credibility as a theory, and the other has none. Literally, none. No evidence for A god, no evidence for any gods. Therefore, a god theory is more of an assertation, a supposition, or hypothesis, because in order to move into the category of theory, one must be able to back up one's hypothesis with verifiable evidence. Evolution has evidence by the truckload, and thus is a "working" theory, meaning not really a theory at all, but fact. Like gravity. Gravity is only a theory because we still have questions about how exactly gravity works, but that doesn't change the fact that it exists.|`|015c4be64c1987ae727eabb9ce9cc03baa	Evolution is a scientific THEORY with litterally tons of evidence to support it. <br>  <br>  God is a concept, an idea, a notion in the mind of human beings.  IT has no counterpart in reality.  It is not a theory of any kind.|`|cl4wdRnvaa	All that evidence FOR Evolution and seems to be none for that God character.|`|XN0cYCATaa	I am sorry, But God and Evolution is not Compatable.<br>  <br>  That is called Theistic Evolution<br>  <br>  A variation on the theme of evolution is theistic evolution. It states that God initiated life on earth and allowed evolutionary principles to bring man to where he is--maybe with a little help from God here and there. At least this theory includes God. But this theory was developed in part by Bible believing people who thought that evolution had some merit. In addition, it is an attempt to answer the many problems existing not only in the fossil record but also with how life could somehow randomly form out of nothing. Because of problems like this, some believe they can be explained by simply adding God to the picture: God directed evolution.<br>  <br>  For those who hold to the Bible as the word of God, theistic evolution should not be a viable option. The Bible says, "Know that the LORD is God. It is he who made us..." (Psalm 100:3). The Scriptures state that God created. God said, "Let there be..." and there was. The Scriptures speak of the creative word of God. When God speaks; it occurs. He said "Let there be" and it was so. It does not say, "Let there be a slow development through an evolutionary process."<br>  <br>  God said in Genesis 1:26, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground." The Hebrew word for "make" in this verse and in verse 25 where God makes the beasts, is "asah." It means to do, work, make, produce. This is not simply the limited Hebrew understanding of evolutionary principles.<br>  <br>  The land animals were made differently than man. The animals were made from the ground but man was made directly by God: "the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being" (Gen. 2:7). Evolution states that man evolved from life forms that developed in the ocean. Here, God made man from the dust of the ground--not the water of the ocean.<br>  <br>  If evolution is true and the Bible is true then how is the formation of Eve explained? She was created out of one of Adam's ribs (Gen. 2:22). There is no way to explain this if theistic evolution is true; that is, unless you want to say that Eve wasn't made from Adam's side. Then, if you do that, you are doubting the very word of God.<br>  <br>  Also, Jesus said in Mark 10:6 "But at the beginning of creation God ‘made them male and female.'" The beginning was not evolutionary slime; in the beginning of creation there was Adam and Eve.<br>  <br>  Though this information is brief and far from complete, it should be obvious that theistic evolution and the Scriptures cannot be harmonized.|`|AA12022384	Evolution is proven with fossils, bones and DNA.<br>  <br>  Religion all religions are based on faith more than theory.|`|iY6GQsRUaa	God hypothesis has not and never will be promoted to that status.|`|AA11297267	"god" isn't a theory, it's an unproven hypothesis that has no evidence showing it to be correct.<br>  Evolution is a fact.<br>  The theory of evolution by natural selection explains one aspect of *how* evolution happened, and is supported by a mountain of evidence.<br>  <br>  So...no.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|RNNsvSh9aa	God is not a theory but an assertion.<br>  <br>  And for the umpteenst time: Theories are the end product of natural science.

For a long time, Christians as well as Non-Christians have been deceived into thinking that just because you claim to follow the Bible or Christ, that you can still be "A True Christian". That is Satan's lie to the Whole World. Satan is a Deceiver, and The Father of Lies. "A True Christian" follows The True Bible and Follows Christ Word for Word, not like Mormons and JW's. Mormons themselves say that even Jehovah Witnesses (JW's deny Christ's full entity as Son of God or the full power of the Holy Spirit) are Christians too simply because they believe in the Bible, but these are all traps and lies from Satan Himself to destroy GOD's Eternal Church and Kingdom in Heaven. Today, we see the rebellion of the Churches against Christ and have an appearance of Godliness (2 Timothy 3:5) in these latter end times of the last days (2 Timothy 3:1). What did we see JW's and Mormons proclaim? The last days and they deceived MANY into their religions. I'm pretty sure though that a JW will get into Heaven before a Mormon does. A Mormon has no idea of what it even means to be a Christian, yet they claim that they do, for this God hath said in the Bible that there will be greater condemnation for the soul that knew Him, but denied Him. JW's might know less about the God of the Bible so they won't suffer as much before the Mormons do. In the end though, LET GOD BE THE JUDGE OF ALL THE EARTH.|`|Mnm35sjNaa	I hope the following true story will give you the "ammo" you need . . .<br>  <br>  . . . One time, 2 young Mormon women came a-knockin'.  They were both very attractive, polite and wholesome.  One of them was black.  I asked her why she chose to be a Mormon when the Book of Mormon contains insulting bigotry against black people.  Here's the verse I'm referring to:<br>  <br>  ????2 Nephi 5:21<br>  ????"And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people, the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them."<br>  <br>  ????See also: Mormon 5:15, Alma 3:6, Alma 3:9, Alma 3:14<br>  <br>  Can you believe that?  God made the descendants of Cain black so that they “might not be enticing” unto white people.  Blatant, transparent racism right in the "holy" Book of Mormon!  Not only is it racist, it's a bald-faced lie!!<br>  <br>  The white woman spoke up for the black woman and said that racism has been renounced by the Mormon church.  The black woman agreed.<br>  <br>  I asked how the Mormon church got the authority to renounce a verse from their "divinely inspired" Book of Mormon: could they override God's word?  They pulled out their "brown books" but could not find an answer.<br>  <br>  I then pointed out that if God really inspired the Book of Mormon, it would NEVER need ANY part renounced.  That only happens when humans pretend they're God.<br>  <br>  I told them that there were already far too many religions in the world before Mormonism came along.  How can God blame anybody for choosing the wrong religion?  Will he really condemn billions of people to hell because they guessed wrong?<br>  <br>  I suggested they keep an open mind and try to place their faith in scripture that doesn't contain ideas and practices that we know are wrong.<br>  <br>  What I didn't say was that, if they really tried to follow my advice, they wouldn't find ANY scripture WITHOUT ideas and practices we know are wrong.<br>  <br>  I must say that, despite the outcome of our conversation, the 2 young ladies remained open and engaged.  I didn’t detect any animosity.  However, when they eventually left, they were visibly shaken.|`|wB3AbJyLaa	Further study of Mormon doctrines reveals plenty of reasons why it would be a big mistake to grant the group its claim of belonging to mainstream Christianity. Mormons subscribe to the idea of an anthropomorphic God with physical, material dimensions. He is a procreating father, all humans were preexistent spirits that he begat, with a divine mother-wife. It is this conviction that under-girds the Mormon emphasis on marriage and parenthood in this life and the next. Some Mormons believe Jesus was married to both Mary and Martha and that he bore children on earth. Good Mormons enter secret temples and don white garments to indulge in esoteric, Masonic-like rituals that seal their marriage for eternity. The most famous of all Mormon aphorisms declares, "As man now is, God once was; as God now is; man may become." God himself was once procreated in another world, and now humans may aspire to the status of pro-creator that he has obtained. Adam did right by eating of the forbidden fruit because it made him capable of fathering the human race. In other words, "Adam fell that men might be." The right to godhead is not earned by the grace of Jesus but by being a good Mormon. Followers of Joesph Smith prove their faithfulness by being baptized and married in the temple, being a member of the priesthood, and tracing genealogies. As potential father and mother gods, Mormons will ultimately have their own planets to populate. All those born in prior to Mormonism's founding in 1830 cannot enter the celestial state without a little help from present-day adherents. The church has blasted a tunnel out of Utah granite, capable of withstanding a nuclear explosion, to house the ancestral records of devout Mormons. Once departed kin have been identified, posthumous proxy baptism are performed. Mormons spend $10 million a year to maintain the facilities, but for them it is well worth it. Some go through the three-hour ceremony on behalf of a non-relative they have never known. Mormons are universalists and believe that everyone will eventually have immortality, with only baptized Mormons attaining godhead. Article of Faith Number Three states, "We believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind may be saved." The priesthood concept, a belief in a resorted priesthood of Aaron and Melchizedek, represents one of Mormonism's most distinctive departures from Christian tradition. All Mormon males over fourteen years of age are eligible for the Aaronic priesthood. At twenty years of age they may enter the higher office of Melchizedek and be designated an elder. Until 1978 those with black skins are forbidden this stature. Mormonism's temples, there are now more than one hundred around the world, were off-limits to blacks because Joseph Smith taught that they were decedents of Cain and therefore cursed. Like its views on polygamy, Mormon views on race were also overturned when church leaders determined the time was right. The church rejects the doctrine of original sin and believes that sinners are punished on earth for failure in their past spirit lives. Blacks were thus guilty of the preexistent sin of rebelling with Lucifer and barred from the priesthood until Mormon leader, First President Spencer Kimball, received a revelation abrogating this injunction.|`|n1sxDwvgaa	If a mormon belives in the death, burial and resurection of Jesus Christ and trusts Him as the risen Savior then that's what is required of them for salvation.

koynaDYbaa	I'm muslim too, if I was in your situation I would teach your kids all the different religions out there in the world so they have a broader understanding of what they can choose if they wish too. <br>  However I think if anyone is practicing a particular religion, e.g. Christian or Muslim, wouldn't you want your child to be brought up in the religion YOU think is right for your child.<br>  <br>  And for people that are saying they will become Athiests.

Your best options are to raise them either as Muslims, Christians, Agnostics or Atheists. <br>  <br>  And once they get older then they can search for themselves and find out the faith that's right for them. Until then you should raise them as one thing or the other but not both.|`|AA10613962	Christianity and Islam clash. They are far too different to ever come to a peaceful agreement. It would be better if you each found a person of your own faith to marry. Christianity teaches that God is love. He is our Heavenly Father. We can go to Him with all things. Jesus taught that the greatest commandments were to love God with all your heart, and to love your fellow man. These two were fulfillment of all the other commandments. Why? Because if one loved their fellow man, one would not steal from him, one would not commit adultery with his wife, etc.  Jesus elevated the status of women. He showed them they too were valued and loved by our Father. Christianity teaches a man is to love his wife like he loves his own body. Not doing harm to her, but loving and cherishing her as he does his own body. Even to the point of laying down his life for her if necessary. <br>  <br>  There is a vast gulf between what is taught in Islam and and what is taught in Christianity. One that cannot be crossed. One is violent and strives to be superior. One is gentle and teaches peace and love. It just would not work. Find someone who believes what you do. It will save you a lot of misery and heartache later on. I hope this helps. Peace!|`|uEjES9Q2aa	First of all I wouldn't advise you to marry a Christian, but that's up to you. As for any possible children you might have in the future...

Raising children in a household where the parents have differing views on religion is a difficult undertaking...I'm speaking from experience. As a Christian and father, I believe it is better for the family to be on one accord and to study the religion I feel is best as the head of my house. That being said, I believe both you and your children would be better if you all served the God of the Bible. On this matter the Bible teaches:<br>  <br>  Joshua 24:15<br>  (15)  And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the LORD, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served in the region beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."|`|nddmwDAmaa	You can have two children: one Christain and the other one Muslim. This is one of the problems of love marriage with the opposite religion. Other wise, all you can do is tell the kid about Islam and Christianity and he will choose. it's more likely that he won't become an atheist because of the similiraty between the two religion. The only difference between Islam and Christianity is that Muslim believe Muhammad SAW to be the last prophet while Christian think of Jesus as God and don't accept islam. They are extremely similar: the principals are same is what I am trying to say.|`|FFqWeIX7aa	I don't think it is legal for a muslimah to married a Christian man unless the man turns to Islam...<br>  <br>  For me, better you try to invite him to Islam, using your intellectuality of al-Quran and comparative religion...<br>  <br>  btw,<br>  if you insist,<br>  I would like to suggest secular view, just married with him...<br>  child tend to follow their mother, unless the father are very influential.<br>  <br>  =)|`|XGHvXTMWaa	peace and blessings in the name of allah, i have a question.

Many of the slaves who did gain some degree of education became aware of the fact that even if they made it out of their current condition they would not receive support elsewhere.

KILFoc6kaa	Luke 8:19 (NIV)<br>  <br>  19 Now Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd.<br>  <br>  Matthew 12:46 (NIV)<br>  <br>  46 While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.<br>  <br>  Mark 3:31 (NIV)<br>  <br>  31 Then Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.<br>  Matthew 13:55 (NIV)<br>  <br>  55 “Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother’s name Mary, and aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?<br>  <br>  Just a few verses that mention his mother and brothers.<br>  <br>  Some claim that these “brothers” were actually Jesus’ cousins. However, in each instance, the specific Greek word for “brother” is used. While the word can refer to other relatives, its normal and literal meaning is a physical brother. There was a Greek word for cousin, and it was not used. Further, if they were Jesus’ cousins, why would they so often be described as being with Mary, Jesus’ mother? There is nothing in the context of His mother and brothers coming to see Him that even hints that they were anyone other than His literal, blood-related half-brothers.<br>  <br>  A second argument is that Jesus’ brothers and sisters were the children of Joseph from a previous marriage, before he married Mary. An entire theory of Joseph's being significantly older than Mary, having been previously married, having multiple children, and then being widowed before marrying Mary is invented. The problem with this is that the Bible does not even hint that Joseph was married or had children before he married Mary. If Joseph had at least six children before he married Mary, why are they not mentioned in Joseph and Mary’s trip to Bethlehem (Luke 2:4-7) or their trip to Egypt (Matthew 2:13-15) or their trip back to Nazareth (Matthew 2:20-23)?|`|xo4iux9gaa	yes<br>  <br>  ."Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the Sons of God; therefore the world knows us not, because it knew Him not".

Some have presented different theories on the subject. For example:<br>  "Did or does God have a daughter? <br>  To place this novel in perspective, I am going to refer to the author’s notes. Lewis Perdue calls his book fiction based on fact. The Roman Catholic Church and other faiths, such as the Russian and Greek Orthodox Churches, have, for a long time, been open to possible existence of a religious figure sometimes referred to as Sophia. The Gnostics believe she was the prime creator of the universe; while others believe that she is “the feminine” side of God; still while others believe that she was the female Messiah. In 310 AD, King Constantine is alleged to have executed her because he feared she would endanger the power of the Roman Empire and the Church."|`|V8Lyc2Jlaa	Yeah, Pinky.

No matter what your belief is, a Christian is to love others, even those they do not agree with.

U2ISEjb8aa	They have not just left the promised land but were actually made to leave.G_d actually got angry with them for not obeying HIM and thus cursed them. G_d gets angry and says “I will scatter you among the nations” (Lev. 26:33).  <br>  <br>  This is the beginning of one verse from a long and powerful passage  (26:14–41) describing the terrifying consequences for the people of Israel if they fail to live up to their obligations under the covenant. It is an ominous depiction of suffering in history: disease, drought, famine so extreme it leads to cannibalism, military defeat, destruction of the land, exile, oppression, physical deterioration and psychological trauma.<br>  <br>  In this context, the verse “I will scatter you among the nations” is clearly part of the series of curses. The verse continues, “I will unsheathe the sword after you; your land shall become a desolation and your cities a ruin.” Later in the passage, a similar verse speaks of God bringing the people “into the land of their enemies” (26:41). Being scattered, and being among the nations, are both clearly part of the punishment in this passage. The “in gathering of the exiles”, the removal of the Jewish people from being scattered among the nations, is an integral part of traditional Jewish messianic expectation.|`|wAygvf74aa	Because they no longer have God's holy spirit protecting them,nor his backing to achieve his own purpose.

It is the Great (kabir) Festival of the Muslim world. <br>  This Festival commemorates the submission to God of the Patriarch Abraham, who was ready to sacrifice his son at his command (Ishmael, according to Muslim tradition, or Isaac according to the Bible; the Koran does not make the name of the son explicit.)<br>  On the eve of Eid-ul-Kabir, everything is purified; houses are cleaned from top to bottom; every cloth, down to the smallest duster, is conscientiously laundered.<br>  Every Muslim family according to their means, sacrifice an animal (a ewe, goat, sheep, cow or camel) by slitting its throat while laid on its left flank, the head towards Mecca. A portion of the meat from this sacrifice will benefit the most destitute among the Muslims, thus asserting the solidarity and mutual assistance prescribed by Allah. <br>  It is a day of reconciliation, where each one is invited to pardon whoever wronged him. <br>  Surah II, 196.

C7Ujon3Xaa	In Hinduism, we believe that the soul is divine and death is but a changing of clothes (the soul moves from one body to another).<br>  The purpose of man is to achieve the realization that his true self is not the body but the Atman (soul) and that He and Brahma (God) are but one.<br>  The soul carries the effects of Karma (actions- good or bad) of the past life and this is responsible for the various occurences and incidents that take place in our life (Note: The actions of our present life effect us as well). In every rebirth, the soul attempts to rise to higher and higher levels of spirituality and finally, after thousands of rebirths ( Great spiritual Gurus and Yogis have achieved this in one life), the Atman achieves the  state of triple consciousness: Sat-chit-ananda . Sat is existence, Chit is consciousness and Ananda is bliss. Moksha is the liberation from the cycle of rebirth and death when the Atman  trancedes to a state of higher consciousness or God-consciousness and becomes one with the divine power.|`|UqgCazhGaa	Bg 15.8 P         The Yoga of the Supreme Person<br>      At the time of death, the consciousness he has created will carry him on to the next type of body. If he has made his consciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat's or dog's body. And, if he has fixed his consciousness on godly consciousness, he will be transferred to Krsnaloka in the spiritual world and will associate with Krsna. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything is finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and his present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One gets a different body according to karma, and he has to quit this body in due course. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of the next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of transmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is called karsati or struggle for existence.<br>  <br>  SB 4.29.64 P Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi<br>     In dreams we sometimes see things that we have never experienced in the present body. Sometimes in dreams we think that we are flying in the sky, although we have no experience of flying. This means that once in a previous life, either as a demigod or astronaut, we flew in the sky. The impression is there in the stockpile of the mind, and it suddenly expresses itself. It is like fermentation taking place in the depths of water, which sometimes manifests itself in bubbles on the water's surface. Sometimes we dream of coming to a place we have never known or experienced in this lifetime, but this is proof that in a past life we experienced this. The impression is kept within the mind and sometimes becomes manifest either in dream or in thought. The conclusion is that the mind is the storehouse of various thoughts and experiences undergone during our past lives. Thus there is a chain of continuation from one life to another, from previous lives to this life, and from this life to future lives. This is also sometimes proved by saying that a man is a born poet, a born scientist or a born devotee.

JAZqgHpGaa	I think most theistic beliefs are blasphemous.  The anthropomorphizing that people do in regard to "God" is blasphemous.

That is the case for this lesson. The question we will address during this lesson is “What does the Bible mean by ‘blasphemy against the Holy Spirit’ and why is this sin unpardonable?” <br>  <br>        Are you guilty of the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit? Many people are unsure, because they do not know what it is. This troubling concept is mentioned in three scriptures: Matthew 12:31-32; Mark 3:28-29; Luke 12:10. Hopefully, our study will help us gain a greater understanding of these texts. I do not believe, nor should you, that this lesson is the definitive treatise on the topic. Rather, view it as a step in the direction of understanding Jesus’ words. We will approach our study by dispelling two assumptions about the texts which mention the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit. Then, based on the immediate and Biblical contexts of the passages, we will note what I believe is not the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit. Finally, we will examine what I believe is the blasphemy of the Spirit in these contexts. <br>  <br>  Discussion: <br>  <br>  I.         Dispelling faulty assumptions. <br>  <br>  A.      Over the years, I have discussed this text with several people, read many commentaries and consulted numerous sermon outlines. I have discovered two often made assumptions that are simply not supported by the texts. Before we can understand what blasphemy of the Spirit is, we must make sure the scales of assumption are cleared from our eyes. <br>  <br>  B.     Assumption #1: Jesus accused the Pharisees of committing blasphemy of the Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  1.       Not one of the texts claims Jesus was accusing the Pharisees. Read them backwards, forwards and upside down, but you will not find Jesus saying the Pharisees had committed this sin. Yet, many Christians assume that is what Jesus did. <br>  <br>  2.       Most assume this because in both Matthew 12 and Mark 3, Jesus was responding to the Pharisees’ accusation that Jesus cast out demons by the power of Satan. <br>  <br>  3.       However, note three reasons why this assumption does not follow from the text. <br>  <br>  a.      Firstly, prior to mentioning blasphemy of the Spirit in both Matthew 12 and Mark 3, Jesus mentions other blasphemies. It makes more sense to link the first mention of blasphemy to the accusation. Thus, one would conclude that Jesus was accusing the Pharisees of the other blasphemies and warning them not to go further and commit blasphemy against the Spirit. <br>  <br>  b.      Secondly, Mark’s statement in Mark 3:30 does not apply simply to mentioning blasphemy of the Spirit, but to Jesus’ entire reply from vs. 23 through vs. 29. <br>  <br>  c.      Thirdly, if these Pharisees had indeed committed the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit, which would not be forgiven, what would be the point of mentioning it to them? <br>  <br>  4.       Instead of accusing the Pharisees, it makes much more sense to believe that Jesus was warning the Pharisees. They had committed blasphemy against Christ, accusing Him of being in league with the devil. Jesus warns them not to commit blasphemy against the Spirit. <br>  <br>  C.     Assumption #2: Jesus said “shall be forgiven” and “shall not be forgiven,” but He meant “can be forgiven” and “cannot be forgiven.” <br>  <br>  1.       I understand the desire to change the meaning of the words Jesus used. But, we are not allowed to simply change the Scripture’s words just because they do not fit our package. <br>  <br>  2.       We know the importance of words in scripture from passages such as Matthew 22:32. Here Jesus argued for the resurrection by noting that God said, “I am” instead of “I was.” Also, Paul, in Galatians 3:16, argued that Christ was the fulfillment of the promise to Abraham because the scripture said the promise was to Abraham’s “seed” not “seeds.” <br>  <br>  3.       Unless proven otherwise by scriptures, we must assign the most natural meaning to the terms “shall be forgiven” and “shall not be forgiven” in these texts. <br>  <br>  II.       What blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is not. <br>  <br>  A.      It is not a sin for which one might seek forgiveness but never be able to receive it. <br>  <br>  1.       Some Christians believe exactly this. I have some notes a sister gave me during a discussion regarding these passages. She wrote, “Those who spoke against the Holy Ghost during Christ’s ministry (during the Mosaical age) and continued to do so. (sic) These persons soon found themselves in the Christian Age-dispensation. If they sought forgiveness they could not receive it.” <br>  <br>  2.       However, this contradicts all of scripture’s teaching. I John 1:9 said if we confess our sin, God is faithful to forgive our sins, making no exception for blasphemy against the Spirit. In II Peter 3:9, Peter claims God wants everyone to come to repentance, making no exceptions. Ezekiel 18:23 claims God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked, bu|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is dying without having believed in Jesus alone for salvation.

When soil is good yet there are thorns then the farmer must get rid of the weeds without harming the tender plant. You can get rid of the thorns (weeds) which are the cares and trials of life, by putting full trust in the Sower (God).  Let go of the things of this life that choke out the growth of your spirit.

WYk0zYdhaa	If you are talking about temptation and you are having a huge battle get an accountibilty partner, talk to your pastor or youth pastor (depending on your age;)  <br>  <br>  Prayer is powerful but sometimes we don't get an answer right away and it can be discouraging.  Keep praying and delve into the word.  See what God says about your affliction or what you are going through.  <br>  <br>  If you are talking about not feeling the fire and not having the intense desire to read God's word as you once did, that is something else.  Usually means something else in our lives has taken that place.  <br>  Also remember that faith should not be led by emotion, just like being in love, there are new levels of intimacy and maturity.  When you first in in the lovey dovey stage you have the little butterflies but that doesn't stay.  It doesn't mean you are less in love, simply that if it's real it changes and progresses.  It's much more deep and not all about emotion but action.  <br>  When you feel this way go to a site like sermonaudio.com or lightsource.com and listen to a podcast.  Get back on the horse and back in the word!  <br>  Get to know the context of the bible as well... it helps to know who a particular book was written to and why.  History is exciting and I've found the more I learn the more the scripture comes alive!  Most of all share with others and have them pray with you, read with you or just talk with.  <br>  <br>  I will pray for ya :)<br>  <br>  Peace in Christ and blessings <br>  <br>  Oh and one more thing when you are praying make sure you really listen, don't miss the little blessings.|`|7z6BWoESaa	Praise God in ALL things! yes ALL God has a plan, praise him for the spiritual weakness, good things will happen! you have to trust and believe that God is in control of everything, He want you to find joy and understanding for everything he does, trust it believeit and praise him for it!|`|xg7On6tvaa	Read 2 timothy 3-16-17….

You need to be really clear about what is a "spiritual weakness" and what is simply putting too much pressure on yourself to be perfect. If this is about some action in the world then I wouldn't call it a spiritual weakness. However, if you are feeling disconnected from the divine source in your life then you could, in addition to prayer, try meditation, fasting (but not for more than 3 days), and doing good works (charity).|`|lXEvMuJBaa	Get out there and take action.

He said treat your brother (meaning neighbor) as in every one, like you want to be treated and God said to do as His son had done. To act and follow his lead on how to treat ppl. and ect. I think if you follow the commandments,treat ppl. w/ kindness, act like Jesus, get saved, ask, believe, and confess, then we all stand a better chance at getting into heaven.

(mormon.org)|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	There are essentially 2 ways to interpret the bible.<br>  Literally,  OR  as a Literalist.  -- the words appear similar, but they are in fact NOT.  MOST people say you should take it literally, BUT, as you will see below,  lack the depth of understanding to PERSONALLY interpret it this way without help.  Therefore MOST people interpret it as a literalist would.<br>  <br>  ALSO, realize that the bible was not written together, it was compiled. As such,  there are going to be "apparent" contradictions. Therefore, you must read the bible differently then you would other books. (because it is not really a book in the traditional sense) No one verse supercedes another.  They must be interpreted in a way which makes them all consistent with one another. Often times this requires you to add the verses together.  For example: if 1 verse says, a women is to obey the man.  BUT, another verse says, a man should LOVE his wife and treat her as if she is PART of his own body.  THEN we should take the 2 verses and consider them together, and get a DEEPER meaning that the relationship between the 2 is complex and intertwined and BOTH are important and BOTH should consider each other's advice and cooperate.  -- So you see, the 2 verses create an "apparent contradiction"  but not an "actual contradiction" or a real one.  It all comes down to "context"<br>  <br>  <br>  Literalist - only considers the words on the page, there literal meaning, little to no consideration for context.<br>  <br>  Literal - starts with words on the page, BUT, also considers "context"<br>  <br>  Context in the bible, and many OTHER texts or books is considered:<br>  <br>  - Understanding of the culture of the time.<br>  - Understanding of Hebrew and Koine Greek, possibly Latin, and how that language was used.  The figures of speech, the idioms of the time. <br>  - Understanding of the writers style of writing. Was he demonstrative?, did he exaggerate for effect (hyperbole), did he refer to the group when he meant the individual, like the general use of "you" to mean an entire group?  Did he tend to emphasize certain aspects more then others?<br>  - Understand the historical events of the time, as these OFTEN times influence how someone writes<br>  - What is the over all, general message that the writer is trying to make, often times what is said is suppose to be interpreted in the context of the overall message. What is the THEME of this writer or book?<br>  - How has the cutlural norms changed since then, for example: slavery in biblical times was more like "endentured servants" of the mid 1700s. It was not at all like the dehumanizing, ownership style of slavery of the 1600s-1800s.<br>  - What is the audience? Was it the nation of Israel? Individual citizens? Christians? Gentiles? Pagans?  who is being addressed?<br>  - How has the circumstances changed? Are we Jews prophesizing and waiting for a Messiah?  Are we still under Roman law? etc.  Did they have mass media, movies, etc. back then?<br>  <br>  These are ALL aspects which create "context"   Most people don't study the bible long enough to REALLY get a proper context.  Because many people can't go back to Koine Greek, Hebrew, or even Latin, they loose a lot of understanding of the WAY in which words can be used. <br>  <br>  Another aspect of the proper interpretation of the bible is to use the context created by the centuries of people studying the bible. <br>  It is good to read it for yourself,  but if YOUR personal interpretation is not consistent with the interpretations of millions, possibly of billions of Christians since around the 4th century AD,   you should SERIOUSLY question your OWN interpretation and see how you can make it consistent with those who believed and lived before you.  Especially the beliefs of the 1-3rd century christians,  many of which were CLOSER to the original events and the original apostles then we are NOW, and therefore probably had a purer understanding which wasn't clouded by thousands of years of changes (language culture, etc)<br>  <br>  SO... by considering ALL those things I listed above and finally by Cross-checking your own interpertation with that of OTHER christians throughout history,  you'll have a much more accurate interpretation and know WHEN you consider something allegorical and when to take it literal.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) How do you know which parts of the Bible are literal, which are allegorical, and which are no longer relevant?<br>  <br>  OK, I'll answer this general question first.<br>  <br>  1a) literal vs. allegorical<br>  <br>  The "safe" approach is the one that I use.  This approach follows the guideline that everything is literal unless<br>  Y) it is identified by Scripture as symbolic or allegorical<br>  Z) it is clearly (that is, incontrovertibly) symbolic or allegorical (such as when Jesus says, "I am the vine, you are the branches")<br>  <br>  <br>  1b) which are no longer relevant?<br>  <br>  There is no Scripture which is no longer relevant.  However, it is very important to understand to whom each Scripture is relevant and how.  For example, the Mosaic Law is part of the Mosaic Covenant, and only partakers of that covenant are required to follow all of those regulations (so says the Mosaic Covenant itself!)  Nevertheless, there are 4 regulations of the Mosaic Law we Christians are required to follow (Acts 15), and many of the regulations of the Mosaic Law are mirrored in the New Testament as regulations for Christians.  I say "mirrored" because the New Testament normally does not require the same penalties as does Mosaic Law - the penalty for Christians is frequently more severe<br>  <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/separating.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/separating....</a><br>  However, even those regulations and penalties described in Mosaic Law are important for Christians, because they are very relevant to understanding the WHY of so many things in the gospels (like, "why the need of the high priest to send Jesus to Pilate", "why Jesus refused to stone the adulteress", etc.)<br>  <br>  <br>  OK, not let's address the particular passages that you have removed from their context....<br>  <br>  2) But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.<br>  <br>  OK - this is clear (given the context).  First, it is clearly restricted to **within the congregation**.  By that I mean, Paul gives specific instructions elsewhere insisting that women teach - children and other women.  Paul also clearly approves elsewhere of a woman who teaches/preaches to a man who is NOT part of the congregation.  SO, the proper interpretation of this passage - in context - is<br>  a) a woman should not teach adult Christian men about Christianity<br>  b) a woman should not have authority *within the congregation* over men.  Outside the congregation a woman is permitted to have any authority over men (other than her husband) - even owning male slaves.  Simply:  a woman should not hold any church office that gives her any type of authority over the men within that church.<br>  c) a woman should be silent when tempted to preach/teach to men of the congregation.  Likewise, when a man is teaching/preaching to the congregation, she should be silent (not disruptive or, by speaking to the congregation, turning attention on herself and away from the teacher).  To put it another way:  she should not orate (speak) to the congregation.<br>  <br>  <br>  3) If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.<br>  <br>  This is part of Mosaic Law and, as described above, is only relevant to<br>  a) partakers of the Mosaic Covenant<br>  b) in regions where slave ownership is permitted by law<br>  Mosaic Law does not allow for the ignoring of the rule of duly appointed judges.  If a judge rules that slavery is illegal, someone who follows Mosaic Law must abide by that judge's decision until it is overturned by a judge of equal or greater authority.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|pakIAYWoaa	both of those references are literal.  the law of slavery is in the second section of the law where God is giving fallen man some sound instructions for making it by.  Most slaves were debtors who sold themselves to make good on a debt.  The threat of forced slavery probably kept people from borrowing money for  frivolous things and the command to let them go was merciful too.  In this law personal responsibility for paying back what you owe is dealt with as well as do not extract more than you should.  The office of pastor teacher is for the man as God set  order of man over the woman.  Jesus being equal with the father took the submissive role as son ans servant of God yet is equal with God.  The woman is not diminished by this and can serve the Lord in any other church office.  If you think this is binding down the woman look at the place women held before Christianity or even today on Muslim and hindu religions; Christianity emancipates when we follow Gods word.  When we think we know more than the Lord that is wrong, embrace Gods word and be blessed.|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	Look at 2Timothy 2:15...the first word of that verse is your answer, AFTER you have come to Christ by God's grace through faith in what He has done on the cross for you, and have been given the gift of the Holy Spirit so that you can discern spiritual things.(see Romans 10: 9,10, and 13)-NOTE: "with the HEART..."  It's a trust thing.<br>  <br>  1Cr 2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know [them], because they are spiritually discerned. <br>  <br>  There's your answer in black and white.

But God didn't. How is this God good then? Hmm? <br>  (Student is silent.) <br>  Prof: <br>  You can't answer, can you? Let's start again, young fella. Is God good? <br>  Student: <br>  Yes. <br>  Prof: <br>  Is Satan good? <br>  Student <br>  : No. <br>  Prof: <br>  Where does Satan come from? <br>  Student: <br>  From...God.... <br>  Prof: <br>  That's right. Tell me son, is there evil in this world? <br>  Student: <br>  Yes.. <br>  Prof: <br>  Evil is everywhere, isn't it? And God did make everything. Correct? <br>  Student: <br>  Yes. <br>  Prof: <br>  So who created evil? <br>  (Student does not answer.) <br>  Prof: <br>  Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things exist in the world, don't they? <br>  Student: <br>  Yes, sir. <br>  Prof: <br>  So, who created them? <br>  (Student has no answer.) <br>  Prof: <br>  Science says you have 5 senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. <br>  Tell me, son...Have you ever <br>  seen God? <br>  Student: <br>  No, sir. <br>  Prof: <br>  Tell us if you have ever heard your God? <br>  Student: <br>  No, sir. <br>  Prof: <br>  Have you ever felt your God, tasted your God, smelt your God? Have you ever had any sensory perception of God for that matter? <br>  Student: <br>  No, sir. I'm afraid I haven't. <br>  Prof: <br>  Yet you still believe in Him? <br>  Student: <br>  Yes. <br>  Prof: <br>  According to empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your GOD doesn't exist. <br>  What do you say to that, son? <br>  Student: <br>  Nothing. I only have my faith. <br>  Prof: <br>  Yes. Faith. And that is the problem science has. <br>  Student: <br>  Professor, is there such a thing as heat? <br>  Prof: <br>  Yes. <br>  Student: <br>  And is there such a thing as cold? <br>  Prof: <br>  Yes. <br>  Student: <br>  No sir. There isn't. <br>  (The lecture theatre becomes very quiet with this turn of events.) <br>  Student <br>  : Sir, you can have lots of heat, even more heat, superheat, mega heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat. <br>  But we don't have anything called cold. We can hit 458 degrees below zero which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. <br>  There is no such thing as cold . Cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat . We cannot measure cold. Heat is energy . Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it . (There is pin-drop silence in the lecture theatre.) <br>  Student: <br>  What about darkness, Professor? Is there such a thing as darkness? <br>  Prof: <br>  Yes. What is night if there isn't darkness? <br>  Student : <br>  You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright <br>  light, flashing light....But if <br>  you have no light constantly, you have nothing and it's called darkness, isn't it? In <br>  reality, darkness isn't. If it were you would be able to make <br>  darkness darker, wouldn't you? <br>  Prof: <br>  So what is the point you are making, young man? <br>  Student: <br>  Sir, my point is your philosophical premise is flawed. <br>  Prof: <br>  Flawed? Can you explain how? <br>  Student: <br>  Sir, you are working on the premise of duality. You argue there is life and then there is death, a good God and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, science can't even explain a thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one..To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. Death is not the opposite of life: just the absence of it. <br>  Now tell me, Professor.Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey? <br>  Prof: <br>  If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, yes, of course, I do. <br>  Student: <br>  Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir? <br>  (The Professor shakes his head with a smile, beginning to realize where the argument is going.) <br>  Student: <br>  Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you not a scientist but a preacher? (The class is in uproar.) <br>  Student: <br>  Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the Professor's brain? <br>  (The class breaks out into laughter.) <br>  Student <br>  : Is there anyone here who has ever heard the Professor's brain, felt it, touched or smelt it? No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have no brain,sir. <br>  With all due respect, sir, how do we then trust your lectures, sir? <br>  (The room is silent. The professor stares at the student, his face unfathomable.) <br>  Prof: <br>  I guess you'll have to take them on faith, son. <br>  Student: <br>  That is it sir.... The link between man & god is FAITH . That is all that keeps things moving & alive. <br>  this student was APJ Abdul Kalam, former president of India|`|exRfWIRKaa	You mean the one in the bible?  He's pure undiluted evil.|`|AA10618636	Though mankind knows GOD and understands that nothing resembles GOD but even then they call GOD a lover or a father. Isn’t it strange that they do not ponder over what they say?<br>  <br>  GOD is GOD<br>  and GOD created love, lovers & beloveds.<br>  <br>  <br>  GOD is GOD<br>  and GOD created all fathers, mother, sons & daughters and GOD is not a man or a creature & GOD is not even a male or a female.<br>  <br>  <br>  And that is what meant by<br>  “Nothing resembles GOD in Heaven or on earth or in waters under the Earth.”<br>  <br>  <br>  It was the possession & hold of GOD or grip of GOD & presence of GOD which was mentioned by the wise as hands or face of GOD to let the villagers believe GOD and wise never told any one that GOD is a man or a male.<br>  <br>  Those who understand must know that the difference of Creator & father is a difference of GOD and the creatures of GOD. So before the Day of Judgment rectify your faith.<br>  <br>  Torah says,<br>  “Remember This! The Lord and the Lord alone___ is our God.<br>  Love the Lord your god with all your heart,<br>  With all your soul, and with all your strength.”<br>  (Deut 6:4-5)<br>  <br>  “Fear the Lord your God, worship only God,<br>  and make your promises in God’s name alone.<br>  Do not worship other gods,<br>  Any of the gods of the people around you.<br>  If you do worship other gods,<br>  The Lord’s anger will come against you<br>  Like fire and will destroy you completely,<br>  Because the Lord your God,<br>  Who is present with you, tolerates no rivals.”<br>  (Deut 6:13-14-15)<br>  <br>  “God is a great god and (only) one to be feared.’<br>  (Deut 7:21)<br>  All the messengers preached the same___ before man or idol worship. True followers of the messengers always followed the True religion and there was no difference of message of the messengers.<br>  For example:<br>  Jesus preached:-<br>  1.HONOUR GOD<br>  2.WORSHIP GOD<br>  3.SERVE GOD<br>  And today’s Christian leaders preach <br>  1.Honour God and Jesus<br>  2.Serve Jesus<br>  3.Worship Jesus, Holy Ghost and God<br>  Same is the case with Muslims. Muslims at the messengers’ time believed in God and followed and worshipped God only___ today’s Muslims follow the religion of their leader and call it Islam. Though, messenger Muhammad clearly mentioned the true religion is Islam:<br>  TO BELIEVE IN ONE ALONE GOD___ TO PERFORM GOOD DEEDS___ TO BELIEVE IN THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT AFTER RESURRECTION.<br>  On record is his word that Islam is to believe in God and to remain firm on that. So, even today we believe in the true religion of all nations__ according to the saying of all messengers.<br>  <br>  Krishna Jee said to his father:-<br>  ‘Leave worship of all demi-gods and worship One, Alone God Only. Who is the Great Master and to serve whom is the duty of the slaves of God.’<br>  God said to Moses:-<br>  “I__AND I ALONE___AM GOD<br>  AND ALL OTHER GODS ARE UNREAL.”<br>  And in Quran God says:-<br>  “I__AND I ALONE AM THE NOURISHER OF THE UNIVERSE.”<br>  And, the word GOD means:-<br>  1.G___ FOR GENERATOR OF THE UNIVERSE<br>  2.O___ FOR ORGANIZER OF THE UNIVERSE AND COSMOS.<br>  3.D___ FOR DESTROYER OF EVERYTHING.<br>  <br>  All Holy Books tell us, that everything will be perished and nothing will be left but The One, Alone God to resurrect all whom God created for the judgement. All the messengers sent to mankind by the Great, AlMighty God__ died but the true religion of the God lives. So, to be the one nation of God:<br>  BELIEVE IN ONE ALONE GOD___ PERFORM GOOD DEEDS___ BELIEVE IN THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT AFTER RESURRECTION.|`|51f7d0ee07bcbaea13dc55784aea7f62aa	Loki was the trickster god.

(John 12:31) Hence, all worship addressed to man-made gods is, in effect, worship rendered to Satan. But Satan is not a god who merits our worship.---He is a self-appointed ruler, a usurper. In time, he himself, as well as all forms of false worship, will be eliminated.

No pork, dairy.<br>  <br>  Three: Sever your connections with girls you once knew or met on the tangible plane.<br>  <br>  They can only make you unhappy and drag down future benevolent romances.<br>  <br>  Four: If you meet a thought-manifestation on the astral plane, and she seems nice, restrain yourself from grabbing hold of her immediately and pecking her on the cheek.<br>  <br>  They don't like this. They respond to whispered praise. Get close enough to do this. They feed on their own pale ethereal form. Tell them it is opalescent and you can see the gems embedded inside them glinting. Do not reach inside to grab those gems, however close they may seem to the surface.<br>  <br>  Five: Never remain a friend too long.<br>  <br>  This is a grave mistake even the pros make. Remember, if the conversation does not grow very heated, gleam with all the blue sparkles in your no-mind.<br>  <br>  Six: Ask for her phone number in the sensual world.<br>  <br>  I know this is not for everybody and forms differ highly from what one perceives on the astral plane. But still if you get her phone number in the sensual world, even if she died years ago, there is still the possibility that she is ready to talk to you even if it means revealing her true self.<br>  <br>  Seven: Never Slumber.<br>  <br>  Sleeping is the mistake that most people make. This weakens the resolution of the third eye. It waters. This action keeps it desperately dry and thirsty for sight of the ordinary world.

It's used to describe something that used to happen regularly in the past or something that was happening in the past. The way you conjugate a verb in the imperfect is by starting with the "nous" form of the present tense, taking off the "ons" ending, and replacing it with the ending that matches your subject (ais, ais, ait, ions, iez, aient).<br>  <br>  However, if you're talking about something that happened once, or something that started or ended, you have to use the passé composé. It's also a past tense, so it's easy to get them confused!|`|BQ0y50Nvaa	We can't really help without the text.<br>  <br>  We'll try to guess what you wrote, and you can try to guess our reply.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If the specific goal was to demonstrate how you use imparfait, you really haven't given them much to go on.

XLXncQu9aa	No.  Prostitution is a terrible way to make money.  I was watching a television program about those that believe that prostitution would actually help the economy.  They are wrong about it helping the economy.  Think about it.  A small percentage of individuals actually participate in prostitution.  Prostitution is a dirty business and it doesn't help the women involved.  Sure they make money off of it, but in a sense the women involved are slaves.  Many of them are raped and beaten if they don't give their clients what they want.  So it shouldn't be legalized.  Neither should drugs.  Drugs are a major issue with our country.  Much of the cartel is moved across the border illegally and that is why drug trafficking is such a problem.  The more use we have the more individuals would make bad choices and you would increase the risk of harm to others.  Neither should be legalized because they both contribute to the down grading of society.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I mean, since it's going to happen anyway, right?|`|f48d10d4bec5b5e25f9894010aed2c69aa	absolutely. i believe prohibition was lifted in response to the depression in the 30s.

h6cYQaxYaa	I have never done drugs of any kind and never will. I think that legalization on pot would be fine. Mainly for the tax benefit to the rest of us. Plus there are medical cases that would benefit from its use so the would be good too. I think one of the reasons that people use it now is because it illegal. The same reason people under 21 want to drink, because there are not suppose to. It think that it would loose some of its luster if it was legal. So yes legalize it but tax it heavily and keep a close eye on it.|`|zM1a6VGXaa	I don't smoke but i think they should legalize it. Mainly because I am a strong believer in the idea of let people choose for themselves. By making it illegal we have made it "wrong" for them to do what they want to do with their lives, and I think that is wrong.

xMCb1e70aa	I can relate to you in several ways...I had the pulpit pounding father. My friend has the bitter Christian mother. You cannot change your them... Don't even try. That is God's place. She may not want to believe her children are growing up and ready to leave the nest. But cramming the bible down ones throat will push you away. Using the bible out of context to get her way or to try to control you is wrong! The bible teaches parents not to provoke your children to anger but teach them though love and example.<br>  God does not control us or oppress us but leads us toward the right path. If we stray from that path, He will bring us back with love and patience, not by grabbing you by the hair and dragging you. That would not be real love. Everyone will make mistakes in life. You shouldn't be stopped from talking about the people in your life either. How are you supposed to ever get married if she doesn't believe you can date!? God did not tell her where to find your diary either...she's using God as an excuse for her snooping around your things to get a look at your personal thoughts instead of talking to you directly. If you truly are a christian, you won't second guess His existence because of someones overbearing control. Respectfully disagreeing with your mother is not breaking any commandments either. All grown children should be able to make decisions for themselves and with some helpful advice from an experienced parent. I am a christian too but because of the control factor growing up and being forced to go to church several times a week, punished if we couldn't go due to illnesses or just being late, no TV, no radio, not allowed to go anywhere, couldn't express my own thoughts without a sermon... I don't like the idea of forcing myself out the door on Sunday morning now and all my brothers are the same way. My spirituality is my own personal journey in this life and no one can force me to do anything I don't want to do. I do live in this world just not of it. 24 is very young. Don't get married too quickly either just to get out from under her thumb. That could bring disaster in itself. You may want to think about you and your brother getting an apartment together or something of that nature just to get some breathing room. It does not sound like a healthy christian environment if she actually scares you into submission. That only sends you running away, fast! Read the Psalms. They are quite soothing for the soul and give you true understanding of what a christian is supposed to be like and don't be too hard on yourself. God accepts you with a loving smile just the way you are...you should too. I hope this helped you...|`|AA12194228	Honor and obey her, but from afar. Be respectful and try very hard to avoid such conversations.<br>  <br>  She is wrong about "being under her jurisdiction" unless she is totally supporting you and your education. Even then, you are an adult who can make her own choices. If she threatens to remove funding, suck it up and make it on your own.<br>  <br>  When I said "obey", I didn't really mean that, however, if you are under her roof, you must respect her rules.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	i would actually just stop talking to her <br>  you said yourself once you speak to her your day is crap <br>  she is controlling and rude <br>  <br>  <br>  if i was you, i would stop calling <br>  why dont you and your sibling move somewhere for the 2 months|`|HVLCWByKaa	Personally, I would stop talking to her, if she doesn't listen to what you have to say perhaps silence will help. She sounds worse than my mom. This is what I don't like about christianity because it just gives people an excuse to try to control and dominate people. That's what christianity has done throughout it's entire history (not counting Jesus' teachings, at least Jesus himself had sense). The church has always tried controlling every aspect of people's lives. <br>  <br>  Try finding someone that you trust that is neutral to this whole ordeal to be a mediator when you try to talk to your mother. Perhaps a pastor from church talk to him or her about the problem you are having and see what s/he says.|`|OpLpq3rIaa	What your mother is, is controlling, it has nothing to do with being a Christian, however, she may want to use it as a tool.  She has to learn that her children are adults now and they have to live their own life, and this would include making mistakes, but hopefully learning from them.  You don't mention anything about your father, so I'm guessing that your mother is alone (I could be wrong) and she needs to hold on to on to, but she still holds on too tightly, she is unaware that all this controlling is actually alienating her children from her, instead of bringing them closer to her.  Unfortunately, even though she is a christian, she is still lost and has no concept about God and his teachings.  She believes that God is a punishing God and not a loving one.|`|aPuj6xoHaa	Exodus 20:12  "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you." <br>  <br>  Honoring our father and mother is for our entire life.<br>  <br>  I don't quite understand why she disbelieves that you are dating, but that is not important.  Is it possible for both of you to try and sit down and try to understand the others viewpoint?  I hope you have the opportunity to both sit down and honestly, openly and lovingly discuss your misunderstandings and be patient with one another.|`|cpOtr6Thaa	You're a sweetheart for such thoughtful consideration of your mom.  <br>  <br>  First, I don't know of any verses that says you're under her jurisdiction until marriage.  She probably cares a lot about you and is afraid to let go.  It's not entirely a religious thing because there are plenty of non-Christian parents who do the same kind of thing.  <br>  <br>  It is best for you to honor your mother, which means to me, that you're respectful in your attitude and words.  But that doesn't mean she has authority over you.  You will have to find a way to set your boundaries with her.<br>  <br>  As far as your faith, I encourage you to seek God and not give up.  I had similar issues with my parents and walked away from God for 10 years.  I came back to Him because I realized that what my parents did and what God teaches were separate and different.  Not only that, but He helped me resolve my issues with my parents. <br>  <br>  Blessings to you!

wB3AbJyLaa	Hell is about relationships, broken relationships. In the Bible, hell is separation or banishment from the most beautiful being in the world, God himself. It's exclusion not only from God but also from those who have come to know and love him. Hell is a punishment for having broken God's standards and is a natural consequence of choosing to be separate from God. The pain may be both mental and physical, but it will be the pain and sorrow of final, eternal banishment from God and the good life for which we were created. Hell is the final sentence that says you refuse regularly to live in relationship with God, and the inevitable result of that choice is to be sent away from God for all eternity. So it is punishment. But it's also the natural consequence of a life that has been lived in a certain direction. There are some theologians who claim that the Bible teaches annihilation. I don't agree with them. Even after all that I've said, the idea of hell doesn't make me happy. It helps me to know that God isn't happy about hell either. Remember, he doesn't send people there; people end up there because they've chosen to live separately from God their whole lives, and when they die, that decision is sealed for eternity. But I don't feel that I have all the answers about hell in order to love God. Think of it this way. When you're trying to start a friendship with someone, you don't understand everything about him, and you don't necessarily agree or feel good about every view he holds. But you have to ask, on a balance, can you trust this person enough to want to begin a friendship with him? The same is true with Jesus. Not every issue will be resolved before we enter into a relationship with him. But the question is, "On balance, can you trust him?" I would encourage anyone struggling with this question to read the gospel of John first and then ask, "Can I trust Jesus?" For me, the answer is yes. And I believe that, over time, as we develop our relationship with him, we'll even come to trust him in those areas that right now we don't completely understand. As the Bible says in Genesis 18:25, "Won't the Judge of the whole earth do what is right?" Ultimately, God is fair. Nobody will be able to walk away from the judgment and say, "God wasn't fair to me."|`|8pQrIL90aa	God is real my friend. I wish that I could tear out my heart and soul and give it to you.

Only God decides who will be destroyed.|`|qEIURrnJaa	God is real.|`|dYDHHxzraa	Is God Real or is he Fake <br>  <br>  <br>  This depends on your literal definition of Real. It also includes your definition of GOD. As there are many, God is often represented as a Entity or an amass of Energy.  How ever we have no physical description of “God” He is often described in biblical context as a spiritual being.  Christianity declares him as omnipresent. He is declared as the “creator”. The Christian scriptures reference him as the “Blessed Trinity”, God the Father, God The Son, and God the holy Spirit. As I had stated there are many description of what God could be. How ever there is no humanly defined “Factual” proof that he exists.<br>  <br>  Science and mathematics have referenced “God” as a representation of infinite. Notable Scalars and Nobel prize wining mathematicians have acknowledge the possibility that a God exists.  German mathematician Georg Cantor’s work on infinity and numbers beyond infinity (the mystical “transfinite”) was denounced by theologians who saw it as a challenge to God’s infiniteness. Cantor’s obsession with mathematical infinity and God’s transcendence eventually landed him in an insane asylum.<br>  For the Hindu math genius Ramanujan, an uneducated clerk from Madras who wowed early 20th-century Cambridge, an equation “had no meaning unless it expresses a thought of God.” Though an agnostic, the prolific Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdos imagined a heavenly book in which God has inscribed the most elegant and yet unknown mathematical proofs.<br>  And famously, Albert Einstein said God “does not play dice” with the universe.<br>  Physics theory “ matter to create matter” Is described as the need of matter to create matter. Meaning everything comes from a source. It takes matter to create more matter. There for its quite possible that this source can be identified as the “creator” or as “God”. <br>  <br>  What becomes infinitely more complex is humans ability to relate to or identify “God”.  Do to there limited perceptual abilities to grasp the concept of  “God”, they create there own ideas of what “God” is to them. Although there are many deference’s in humans idea of what God is, there are equally as many communalities. God is often referenced as a source of  power or knowledge. He is considered a entity greater then them selves. <br>  <br>  My personal opinion is that “God” is a concept that is, and will remain out of human perception. As long as humans continually limit them selves to the perceptions of others.  I feel that God can be anything we want him to be. I don’t see any harm in this as long as the disciplines created for him do not negatively effect others. Many argue that God and religion are used as crutches or excuses to negatively impact the world. This very well may be true. How ever it also is used to positively influence the populace, and create “good” and “kind” acts in people. I feel that the responsibility falls upon human kind, in the manor in which people use the idea of “God”. Because man kind was born with the concept and ability of choice (i.e) the ability to choose one action or the other.

ok0bt0A5aa	If what mean by spirituality is reflection of some sort, prayer, meditation, chanting and the like than it can help heal.  It can't make magic, but it can help heal and focus you.  Serious scientific research has been going on for some time regarding meditation and brain health because researchers continue to find promising results.  Here is what I know for sure:   when times get difficult it's important to help your negative thoughts settle down, meditation and counseling can help with this.   Go to the library, take out some cds or tapes on meditation.  Some of them are more practical, some are more religious, it's really up to you to find something that suits you.  Find one you like and then do it.  I lived in Los Angeles for 7 years.   It's not unusual for people to have trouble adjusting to being there.  It's different than the east coast and the mid-west -- signals are different, etc.  Also, is there counseling available at your school?  If so it would probably be a good idea for you to talk to someone.  If there's not counseling available at your school, let me know what part of LA you're in, and I may be able to assist you in finding some resources.  <br>  Best to you.|`|52246014c6731089215da64339f2d610aa	You need to get real and accept coincidence for what it is.

i1OCL13Jaa	Because it wouldn't make much sense to wear a mask and Halloween costume on Ash Wednesday.|`|zhaHc4FAaa	Ash Wednesday gets its name from the practice of placing ashes on the foreheads of the faithful as a sign of repentance. The ashes used are gathered after the Palm Crosses from the previous year's Palm Sunday are burned. In the liturgical practice of some churches, the ashes are mixed with the Oil of the Catechumens[1] (one of the sacred oils used to anoint those about to be baptized), though some churches use ordinary oil. This paste is used by the priest who presides at the service to make the sign of the cross, first upon his own forehead and then on each of those present who kneel before him at the altar rail. As he does so, he recites the words: "Remember (O man) that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.<br>  <br>  <br>  At Masses and services of worship on this day, ashes are imposed on the foreheads of the faithful (or on the tonsure spots, in the case of some clergy). The priest, minister, or in some cases officiating layperson, marks the forehead of each participant with black ashes in the shape of a cross, which the worshipper traditionally retains until washing it off after sundown. The act echoes the ancient Near Eastern tradition of throwing ashes over one's head to signify repentance before God (as related in the Bible). The priest or minister says one of the following when applying the ashes:<br>  <br>  Remember, O man, that you are dust, and unto dust you shall return. (Latin: Memento homo, quia pulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris.)<br>  <br>  —Genesis 3:19<br>  Turn away from sin and be faithful to the Gospel.<br>  <br>  —Mark 1:15<br>  Repent, and hear the good news.<br>  <br>  —Mark 1:15<br>   <br>  "Ash Wednesday" by Carl Spitzweg: the end of Carnival.The ashes used in the service of worship or Mass are sacramentals, not a sacrament. The ashes are blessed according to various rites proper to each liturgical tradition, sometimes involving the use of Holy Water. In some churches they are mixed with light amounts of water[2] or olive oil[3][4], which serve as a fixative.<br>  <br>  In most liturgies for Ash Wednesday, the Penitential psalms are read; Psalm 51 (LXX Psalm 50) is especially associated with this day.[5] The service also often includes a corporate confession rite.<br>  <br>  In some of the free church liturgical traditions, other practices are sometimes added or substituted, as other ways of symbolizing the confession and penitence of the day. For example, in one common variation, a small card or piece of paper is distributed to the congregation on which a person is invited to write a sin she/he wishes to confess. These small cards are brought forth to the altar table where they are burned.[6]<br>  <br>  In the Roman Catholic Church, ashes, being sacramentals, may be given to any Christian [7][8] as opposed to Catholic sacraments, which are generally reserved for church members, except in cases of grave necessity.[9][10] Similarly, in most other Christian denominations ashes may be received by all who profess the Christian faith and are baptized.[11]<br>  <br>  In the Roman Catholic Church, Ash Wednesday is observed by fasting, abstinence from meat, and repentance—a day of contemplating one's transgressions. The Anglican Book of Common Prayer also designates Ash Wednesday as a day of fasting. In other Christian denominations these practices are optional, with the main focus being on repentance. On Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, Roman Catholics between the ages of 18 and 59 are permitted to consume only one full meal, which may be supplemented by two smaller meals, which together should not equal the full meal. Some Roman Catholics will go beyond the minimum obligations demanded by the Church and undertake a complete fast or a bread and water fast. Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are also days of abstinence from meat (for those Catholics age 14 and over), as are all Fridays in Lent. Some Roman Catholics continue fasting during the whole of Lent, as was the Church's traditional requirement, concluding only after the celebration of the Easter Vigil.<br>  <br>  As the first day of Lent, it comes the day after Shrove Tuesday or Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), the last day of the Carnival season.[12]|`|3a9f326d01ff48571ab8b07403c16d21aa	To fast an pray you are supposed to wear sack cloth which is a peasants clothing and sit in the ashes of burnt offerings.

The only thing that doesn't count on Sundays during Lent is observation of the required fast of one meal and two small snacks a day with meat only eaten once during the meal.  Fasting and temporal work is the only thing that is not observed on Sunday.  I have even heard the sorrowful mysteries recited on Sundays during Lent.  We also say the stations of the cross after Mass on every Sunday during Lent.<br>  <br>  But then again I go to the Latin Mass, pre Vatican II pre 1962 and we are far more traditional and far more in tune with Catholic doctrine and dogma.|`|AA12128229	Throw the man made junk away, and say halleujah everyday, Christ is not on the cross anymore, he is risen!

However, it seems like you are a good person, so if there is a hell, you wont be going there. The guilt you are feeling shows that you do care, and that you are a good person.

Although things seem bad you are at an ideal position to turn your life around.  If you look you will see that your old personality was not  very clever or nice.  It maybe time to kill off your old personality and recreate yourself as the beautiful person you (and everyone) have the potential to become.  Learn to meditate and get in touch with your conscience and try to do what is wise.  Right thoughts are followed by right speech which is in turn followed by right action.  Change comes from within, and with a bit of self discipline you can control your thoughts which will in turn change your whole life around.  Don't put it off till tomorrow!!!  Start today - every great journey starts with that first tiny step.  Try renaming yourself with a name that describes the very best virtues that you wish to aspire to.

Plus the fact you feel guilty shows you are NOT evil.<br>  <br>  And these things you did when you were a child don't really count as all children are pretty ignorant - they don't know any better at that stage.<br>  <br>  So please don't kill yourself - you are not a bad person.|`|XKzUsb7zaa	Okay do not kill yourself!!

There is hope for all people.  God does not desire that any human spend eternity in the hell prepared for the devil and his messengers.  God provides a way for your forgiveness of ALL PAST sins -- even the ones you mention -- in the blood of Christ (Eph 1:7).  Put on Christ according to God's terms and you are forgiven (Gal 3:26-27). Continue walking in His light and you will have the assurance of heaven (1 John 1:7-9; 5:13).|`|KDNWFuZWaa	I don't believe in hell, I do know that people who do generally think committing suicide sends you straight there so not a good option.|`|4644ec1ac391913c8f074e3b205f8168aa	God is good, loving, kind and merciful but He is also righteous holy and just and hates sin.<br>  <br>  Christ was quite definite about Hell and why else would He suffer so greatly if it were not to deliver us from it?<br>  <br>  He does not delight in the death of a sinner and so great is His love that He has made provision for all that none need suffer His judgement for sin.<br>  <br>  If you kill yourself will you not force the issue and force God's judgement?

Then you will NEVER be sent to hell, no matter what.  <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|b8pd8EdAaa	We all sin darling. If anyone says they don't they are sinning when they say that because they are lying. You  (and me and everyone else) deserve to go to hell for our sins. BUT, God loved us so much that he sent Jesus, his son, to die as payment for our sins so that we could have eternal life. That means living in heaven with Him. All you have to do is believe that and that God raised Jesus from the dead after he was in the tomb for three days. just tell Him in your own words that you believe it and ask Him to forgive you of your sins through the blood of Jesus Christ. Our Lord and savior.  He will wash you clean of all sins. Read Matthew, Mark, Luke and John of your bible. It's all in there. None of us can get to heaven on our own.

The main trick is to show a lot of skin. Try putting together some fishnet hose with a slightly frayed miniskirt and a halter top. If you have old clothes you no longer wear, you can cut them up to create this Halloween costume. Add some high-heeled shoes and a pirate hat and you're in business.<br>  <br>  If you're a man, why not model your sexy pirate Halloween costume after Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Carribean? Take an ordinary linen shirt with a large black vest, bell-bottom black pants and black boots. Put a big belt with a big buckle over this, and tie a long white sash over that. Preferably, everything should be a little bit sooty. Then come up with some novelty hair. This can be inexpensively bought at most costume stores or at Wal-Mart. Be sure to scare up a big pirate hat while you're at the store. Tuck some of the hair under the hat, and use glue or tape to adhere the beard to your chin. Make sure that the adhesives you use are safe for use on skin. If you like, you can put some beads on your beard for your sexy pirate costume, but be sure to do this before you tape or glue it on.<br>  <br>  Sexy Cop Costumes<br>  <br>  This sexy cop Halloween costume idea will work for both men and women. Get together some navy blue pants and a navy blue top. The top should have a very low neckline. Then find a police badge, a police hat and some handcuffs. Finish your sexy cop costume off with a prop gun and some sunglasses. Ladies can also select to show more skin by using short shorts and a cut-off or tied top with the sexy cop costume. Guys can try going sleeveless to show off those biceps.<br>  <br>  Sexy Nurse<br>  <br>  To create your sexy nurse Halloween costume, first get a simple short white dress. This can either be all one piece or a white blouse with a mini-skirt. Find some long white stockings and garters, and white high heeled shoes. Then all you need to complete your sexy nurse costumes is a stethoscope and nurse hat.<br>  <br>  Sexy Sailor Costumes<br>  <br>  The sexy sailor Halloween costume, like the sexy cop costume, should center around navy blue pants and a navy blue jacket with a low neckline. Pin on a few medals, and put on some white gloves. Hunt down a navy cap. Guys should finish their sexy sailor outfit with navy loafers, ladies with high heels.<br>  <br>  You can also go for a skimpier sexy sailor Halloween costume. Look for something navy blue or white with blue stripes. You can also choose a cheap white sailor's cap for your sexy sailor costume. However, this is best paired with the white sailor uniform. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sexy Military Costumes<br>  <br>  There are a variety of different ways to create your sexy military Halloween costume. One is to go for the formal look. Men can put on their "dress blues" by combining tight navy blue pants, a white shirt and a navy blue jacket. Except leave your shirt and jacket wide open, showing some chest. Ladies can use a shorter jacket with a mini-dress and navy high heels or thigh-high boots for their sexy military costume.<br>  <br>  Preferably your jacket should have shiny brass buttons and a little gold braid. These can be sewn on easily. Finish the sexy military costume with an army hat and some army medals and patches.<br>  <br>  Another sexy military costume idea is camouflage, which is cheaper and more flexible than a dress army uniform. This can be a skimpy camouflage bathing suit, or shirt and shorts or skirt, or a sleeveless camouflage top with long camouflage pants. Find a camouflage top to go with your sexy military costume. <br>  Sexy Devil Costumes<br>  <br>  For ladies, easiest way to create a sexy devil Halloween costume is to put a red leotard together with red tights or panty hose. You can put a red mini-skirt over the top of this, but you don't have to. You'll need a spiked tail and a three-pronged pitchfork. You can attach some horns to a headband to finish off your sexy devil costume.<br>  <br>  For a men's sexy devil costume, try combining tight red shorts with a red cape. You can also try a full body leotard. Add a spiked tail, a pitchfork and horns, and you're done.<br>  <br>  Sexy Angel Costumes<br>  For a sexy women's angel Halloween costume, start with a white leotard or short white dress. Wear white tights or hose, or select stockings with garters. Finish your sexy angel costume with high heels,white wings and a halo.<br>  <br>  Sexy Referee Costumes<br>  <br>  To create a sexy women's referee Halloween costume, combine a top with black and white vertical stripes with short black shorts or a short black mini-skirt. Wear black hose or tights with black high heels or black high-topped boots. Place a whistle around your neck to finish your costume.<br>  <br>  For a sexy men's referee costume, combine tight black shorts (black Speedos will also do) with a tight shirt with black and white vertical stripes. You an also try going sleeveless. Wear knee-high black and white striped socks and carry a whistle.

His disciples got hungry and started to pluck heads of grain and to eat. 2?At seeing this the Pharisees said to him: “Look! Your disciples are doing what it is not lawful to do on the sabbath.” 3?He said to them: “Have YOU not read what David did when he and the men with him got hungry? 4?How he entered into the house of God and they ate the loaves of presentation, something that it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but for the priests only? 5?Or, have YOU not read in the Law that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple treat the sabbath as not sacred and continue guiltless? 6?But I tell YOU that something greater than the temple is here. 7?However, if YOU had understood what this means, ‘I want mercy, and not sacrifice,’ YOU would not have condemned the guiltless ones. 8?For Lord of the sabbath is what the Son of man is.?.?.<br>  <br>  (Mark 3:1-6) .?.?.Once again he entered into a synagogue, and a man was there with a dried-up hand. 2?So they were watching him closely to see whether he would cure the man on the sabbath, in order that they might accuse him. 3?And he said to the man with the withered hand: “Get up [and come] to the center.” 4?Next he said to them: “Is it lawful on the sabbath to do a good deed or to do a bad deed, to save or to kill a soul?” But they kept silent. 5?And after looking around upon them with indignation, being thoroughly grieved at the insensibility of their hearts, he said to the man: “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored. 6?At that the Pharisees went out and immediately began holding council with the party followers of Herod against him, in order to destroy him.?.?.<br>  <br>  (Luke 13:10-17) .?.?.Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. 11?And, look! a woman with a spirit of weakness for eighteen years, and she was bent double and was unable to raise herself up at all. 12?When he saw her, Jesus addressed her and said to her: “Woman, you are released from your weakness.” 13?And he laid his hands on her; and instantly she straightened up, and began to glorify God. 14?But in response the presiding officer of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus did the cure on the sabbath, began to say to the crowd: “There are six days on which work ought to be done; on them, therefore, come and be cured, and not on the sabbath day.” 15?However, the Lord answered him and said: “Hypocrites, does not each one of YOU on the sabbath untie his bull or his *** from the stall and lead it away to give it drink? 16?Was it not due, then, for this woman who is a daughter of Abraham, and whom Satan held bound, look! eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?” 17?Well, when he said these things, all his opposers began to feel shame; but all the crowd began to rejoice at all the glorious things done by him.|`|yHfsHp6naa	Not unless it's a McRib.|`|AA10471892	No. <br>  <br>  You have yarn that eats cats?<br>  <br>  .|`|AA11707311	If you are not a Jew, under Mosaic law, you have no worries.

One of them was still pretty ill the next day.<br>  You probably have had your drink spiked; it does explain the black outs.

Ignore them and they will move on to another victim.|`|VMY7No0eaa	Not much...<br>  Bullys just feed on you saying something back to them.<br>  <br>  All you can do is remove yourself from their area... or <br>  if they ask a stupid question... ask them back "why do you ask?" <br>  <br>  Yes taking a martial arts class will keep people from thinking you are an easy mark... I would do that .. it will give you confidence you don't have now<br>  <br>  You have to give more detalis on what is happening so people can give you a comback or what not to do.<br>  good luck|`|CyDVisE7aa	Hi you can say nothing one thing I learned about bullying is they do not like to listen let alone listen to your opinion doing so engaging them in a conversation is pointless. its the hardest thing to hear but you have to ignore them it really does work and I dint believe it at first I am not telling you ignoring them makes it go away in 1 night you have to give it time. If they are hitting , grabbing or anything of that nature go to the principal then go home and tell your parents about the situation this is important you have to get your parents involved if they are physically harming you if that doesn't work go to your local police department with your parents and file a harassment complaint. believe me I know what I am talking about I was bullied all the time through all grades.<br>  <br>  best of luck to you|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Bullys need a response to continue to bully.  Ignore their advances.  It isn't easy.  Stand tall and don't appear meek or frightened and move on and away from them.  Your friends know who you are and that is what matters.  Bullys are kids with a huge lack of self esteem so they need to pick on those that seem weaker to prove they are worthwhile.  While martial arts as others have suggested would definitely improve your own sense of self, I wouldn't use it as a way to deal with the bullys.  Reacting to them is what they long for.  Take the course to increase your own self respect.|`|BOWa3Abbaa	Well we need some more information here, what is it they are doing? But something you could say in the meantime is. If you guys are really tough then you wouldnt need to prove it on me. You could say that, then take martial arts classes. Good luck.|`|145811a27a6c8d5d7b012583d1de95f0aa	Don't stand for it.  Report them.  You get no honor by not reporting them.  Let them all be disciplined.|`|JpRBvUobaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Bullies tend to react to something they are jealous about in you and your personality. They may be insecure.<br>  I was bullied at school for being quiet and kind to other people. I was also well liked as a friend by the boys in my class so the girls didnt like me and decided to put me down. You need to tell your teachers. Don't them let see they upset you as this fuels them further I would imagine. Things might have changed since I was young but I wish sometimes I had punched the ringleader of the bully group in the nose because I was that angry. Instead I was moved to another school.

If you care about my personal philosophy it's this: There seems to me to be 3 options regarding what happens when we die. 1- Reincarnation. If this is true then a person who commits suicide would be engaging in a deeply ungrateful act since a human life is a treasure. To reject a human life would likely lead to your next life being less-than-human or possibly the type of life where you have to learn the true value of life. So, your next life after a suicide is not going to be pleasant. 2- Heaven/Purgatory/Hell- If this is true then there is probably some creator God or Goddess and I'm sure he/she is not going to be too pleased at you rejecting the precious gift of life that was given to you. So, once again, your experience after death is not going to be pleasant. 3- Nothing- If this is true then you just threw away your only chance. You don't get to try again. That's it. Game over.<br>  <br>  I'm sure there are many other options but I think they probably all come out the same way. If you kill yourself then whatever happens next is not going to be so great.|`|gC5eFMyTaa	Thou shall not Kill!        PERIOD.<br>  <br>  GOD Bless YA,<br>  <br>  Chicago Bob.

There are no mulligans with suicide.<br>  <br>  Secondly, life is what you make it.  People of almost any theology can agree on this.  You can either take your life, or take control of it.<br>  <br>  Finally, suicide is the ultimate in selfish acts.  The person who kills themself is thinking only of themself, not the other people who would be affected by their death.  Friends, family, and coworkers will all be affected by their departing in some way.  Even if the person is destitute and alone, society will still foot the bill because of health regulations stating that a dead body must have a certain type of disposal, be it cremation or burial.  If the person has no family, friends, etc., the government pays for such internment.  Having been through this, I can tell you it isn't cheap, either.|`|JMOLRKRraa	Basically the instinct of survival,<br>   if you took spirit, devil and God out of the equation, <br>  would negate anyone ever commiting suicide. <br>  It does not exist in the animal kingdom.<br>  <br>  Philosophically you did not complete your life work, and spiritual mission by ending your life early. Maybe your entire life's purpose is the last 1-2 years of your life, which you missed because you ended your life early.<br>  <br>  So you may have to come back, with additional challenges and do that which you failed to complete, again. I prefer to get everything done and out of the way asap.<br>  There is real risk of spiritual punishment for suicide and ending your life early.<br>  Everyone is part of a puzzle, missing one piece can delay or mess up the perfect plan of God.

Therefore, if you really want to throw away something so precious as life, as you only have one life, then go ahead. The world will go on without you, problems will still go on in this world, but you will just have thrown away the greatest thing in existance, just because of a few little emo problems you have.

So I highly advise you get a hold of yourself and stay alive.|`|toSnUTMUaa	“IT IS suffering to live.” That is what Ryunosuke Akutagawa, a popular writer in early 20th-century Japan, wrote shortly before committing suicide. However, he prefaced that statement with the words: “Of course, I do not want to die, but .?.?.”<br>  Like Akutagawa, many of those who take their life do not want to die as much as they want “to end whatever is going on,” stated one psychology professor. The wording so commonly found in suicide notes suggests as much. Such phrases as ‘I could not take it any longer’ or ‘Why go on living?’ show a deep desire to escape life’s harsh realities. But as one expert described it, committing suicide is “like treating a cold with a nuclear bomb.”<br>  <br>  “When someone is alone with his problem, then he usually sees it as disproportionately large and as unsolvable,” says Béla Buda, the Hungarian health official quoted earlier. This observation underscores the wisdom of the ancient proverb in the Bible: “One isolating himself will seek his own selfish longing; against all practical wisdom he will break forth.”—Proverbs 18:1.<br>  <br>  Life is a gift from God. Granted, at times life may feel more like a burden than a gift. Can you imagine, though, how you would feel if you were to bestow a valuable gift on someone who then threw it away before really putting it to use? We imperfect humans have barely begun to use the gift of life. In fact, the Bible indicates that the life we live right now is not even “the real life” in God’s eyes. (1?Timothy 6:19) Yes, in the near future our life will be far fuller, richer, and happier. How so?<br>  The Bible says: “[God] will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.” (Revelation 21:3,?4) Try to picture what your life will be like when those words are fulfilled. Take your time. Try to create a full, colorful mental picture. That picture is no empty fantasy. As you meditate on how Jehovah has dealt with his people in the past, your confidence in him will grow and that picture can become all the more real to you.—Psalm 136:1-26.
AA10024451	According to the law, probably a large fine and maybe some jail time if it's not a first offense. But then that would be the punishment for anyone.....so why do you ask of someone who's a Jehovah's Witness? What difference does their religious persuasion make?<br>  <br>  - Contrary to the statements of the ignorant, the individual would not be automatically shunned or disfellowshipped. Obviously the congregation elders would meet with this person and decide what course of corrective discipline would be merited in the situation.|`|AA11025703	???  Um ok.<br>  <br>  I am a Christian, one of Jehovah's Witnesses.<br>  <br>  Though rare, there of course are times when Even Witnesses make mistakes, and are arrested (though thankfully not me:D)<br>  <br>  If it was an Elder, he would, in keeping with Bible principles, most likely step down from being an Elder, until, at least, he could get his life back in order.  Elders are to strive to lead exemplary lives.  As sheppards of the flock, they can't preach one thing, and live another.<br>  <br>  Of course, my answer is based on a one time mistake of some sort.<br>  <br>  Depsite what others have ridiculously claimed, he wouldn't be Disfellowshipped.  If he made a mistake, it would be taken as... He made a mistake.  If anything, the brothers and sisters would probably feel guilty.  That is how I often feel when I hear another person stumbles.<br>  <br>  I remember when a friend of mine was disfellowshipped.  I felt like such a jerk.  I didn't know, or even notice, he was falling away from Jehovah.  Thankfully he did return, but just like in a flesh and blood family, you feel saddened when someone you love is having troubles, even if it's something they've done to themselves.|`|AA12073868	He would face the legal system like any other offender and if convicted would have to serve whatever sentence the court handed down.<br>  <br>   From the congregation's aspect, he most likely would step down as an elder.

If he was driving under the influence, he was breaking Caeser's law and has to deal with it.|`|8Ddi57v2aa	I know first hand about DUI arrest because of someone close to me.  It is very extremely costly and takes a toll on the family, financially and shamefully.  DUI is a serious law offense and because it is that serious, I would believe it would be a serious offense toward the religion.  I wonder if the Congregation will help put food on the table for that family.  The law will take a whole lot of money from the DUI charges.|`|inMO8g0vaa	Shunning or excommunication.<br>  <br>  I went to school with a great girl who ended up making a mistake and getting pregnant, she lived for her church, when it happened she was shunned by her parents and church and even the boy who did it to her.

Maybe even disfellowshipped.<br>  As far as an elder is concerned just as Jehovah uses holy spirit to appoint a man,by means of that same holy spirit, Jehovah will remove from office those who fail to exercise fruitage of the spirit and whose pattern of life falls short of scriptural requirements.|`|865bVfl3aa	It really just depends on the details of the situation.

LGvwl67waa	Not at all... forgiveness is part of human nature (unlike what some may say).<br>  <br>  Revenge is a poison for the soul. Revenge is a personal feelings that does not affect the person you wish taking revenge of.<br>  <br>  Compassion, another trait of human nature, allows you to put yourself in another's place, to understand them and to go on with your life without wishing them harm.<br>  <br>  Revenge is an aggressive feeling born out of your survival instinct. It allows you to attack your attacker rather than fleeing, which gives you more chances of staying alive. But, when you aren't threatened by this attacker anymore, revenge becomes useless.<br>  <br>  You can seek "justice" afterward, which is a desire born from your "soul" (intelligence + emotions) to prevent this person from harming you again or repeating these actions unto another human being ("survival of the tribe" instinct) or to find a source of emotional and psychological healing.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	Forgiveness needs no association with any religion or supernatural beliefs. Its a psychologically benefical act for yourself. You don't have to let people who have hurt you continue to do so but forgiveness for the past allows you to move forward and be a happier person. Revenge is something that allows negative feelings to become your focus rather then living your life in more positive ways. It can also lead to cycles of negativity when the person or someone close to them wants to strike back if they know and are able. Its much healthier to learn from what happened but let it go and forgive. For yourself as much as the other person.|`|66ae930022bf29f4c8379012ac4ae691aa	Forgiveness is a moral, not religious, trait.  Therefore, you can be anything and forgive something.  It isn't like asking "can I be agnostic and tithe ten percent of my income to a church"; well you could, but you'd be practicing a religious doctrine.  <br>  <br>  You can, and depending on the situation, should forgive someone.  However, I suppose it depends on what we're talking about.  I don't believe in forgiving anyone of anything.|`|253e6b2bad99caee34d55cd7b6a38ec0aa	Yes.

I forgive constantly.  Partly because I make mistakes and misjudgements myself, so how can I sit in judgement of others?  Secondly, holding a grudge fills me with negative energy and leaves of not much use to anyone.  Third, to take revenge is human nature, but it also forces you to lower yourself to the level of the person that hurt you.  How special can that be?  I know aeitheists who forgive; it is often simply an intelligent choice.|`|gC5eFMyTaa	Absolutely, Because JESUS is talking to you. To find out more? Sit in a Quite place, Like a Closet.

You are running a business, let this women know that her rate will need to be increased-this is because you are watching one of her children for free-when another child could be in this spot.  From a business stand point, you are losing money.<br>  She also must understand that you understand the situations which she is going through but from a business stand point--If she is going to drop her children off on a day that you are not scheduled to watch her children, this must be pre-arranged because this is -- extra time-extra days and extra money in your pocket. <br>  This is a business which you are running, and as soon as you realize this the better off you will be.<br>  You must stop permitting people to step all over you--you are running a business.<br>  Hope this helps you--Good luck.|`|FcZU29W6aa	Here is a book you need to get:<br>  <br>  "When I Say No, I Feel Guilty".

You don't get emotional and you don't say anything else.  The rest of it is just crap you put up with as a daycare provider.|`|1fd9957e2ec9a7bf90a8eb7c7c9d3c47aa	Her hard life doesn't have to infringe on yours. She is taking advantage of your good nature, so of course you feel anger. If you do not want to watch her children anymore, call her and tell her how you feel. Don't make any excuses.You could give her a two week notice to find another person to care for them, and then stick to your decision.You shouldn't feel trapped in this situation.|`|EyCgjjV4aa	i hate when that happens. Sit her down and start off with how used you feel. make this about you and not her. so she knows that she is pissin u off. Then tell her as much as you would like to continue the sitting you think that its not good for your relationship. get your hubby on ur side too, if he dont come over easy, be wary he might have a crush or something juvinile on her. tell her she has 2 weeks to get another sitter. and if she cries, pat her on the sholder and tell her that tears are healty. lay it out, all of it for her, the money time and pickiness issues. if she promises to change, tell her her futer sitter will appreciate it. be strong hard and in control.!!!|`|rThIVk2maa	Well, I can see this won't be easy for you, but here's what you really need to do. At some point, and the sooner the better, you're going to have to say *and smile* "I hate to have to do this, but my expenses have gone up and I'm going to have to charge you my normal rate to watch Jackie and Jennifer." <br>  <br>  If she protests then you can look very sad and say "I'm really sorry, as I said, I hate to have to charge more, but I was hoping you would understand. I really am going to miss seeing the children every day, but should you change your mind, please don't hesitate to call me." Thus you have ended the discussion and not left room for her to protest. <br>  <br>  How she finds childcare is NOT your responsibility. Your responsibility lies in providing for your family and not taking money away from them just to make another person happy. DO NOT give excuses as to why. That will be hard, but keep it vague "my expenses have increased" is the only thing you need to say. She can't argue if you don't give her information to argue with. <br>  <br>  Keep your feelings out of this altogether. That's how she is getting the better of you, making you FEEL bad, so do NOT talk about how you feel. And don't let your resentment show. Best of luck to you!!|`|33d7210d104ceb5ac8526a1cc2d5871baa	You started a pattern of watching her child at half price, and now you have two of her children at half price.  Bad things happen when friends have dealings with money. You said that they are having a tough time and with her husband in the hospital, it doesn't make it easier for them. Don't compound their troubles by asking for more money.  You contracted with her so stick with it.  No, it isn't easy for you, but its harder for them.  If you met them at church, you may consider using what you have learned at church and help them a little.  IN the future, stick with your price... no exceptions.  This can be a learning experence for you.<br>  Good luck|`|FhVolXVIaa	Prayer...prayer...prayer...<br>  Pray for her and her imperfections and ask God to help hold you up and give you the words to let her know that you are feeling abused without offending her, remember you do have to go to church with her. Forgive her for making you feel this way. I run a home daycare so I understand where you are coming from, let her know that you are willing to help them but you feel it is necessary to raise her rate due to the fact that their are two children and longer hours now and if she needs you on a day off she needs to call you and make sure that you don't have any plans and I would charge her an hourly rate on those extra days.<br>  <br>  patience;<br>  Words said impatiently can really hurt others and ruin a friendship Proverbs 13:3<br>  God encourages us to be patient and think before we speak Proverbs 15:28|`|UMYda9Jaaa	I would say that you've definitely put yourself in a tough space. Realize first of all that while this woman may be taking advantage of you, you had a part to play in allowing it. The situation has two sides to it.<br>  <br>  However, there are several things you can do. First of all, make a policy never to care for the children of friends. Be prepared to stand up for yourself in future so that you don't end up making a victim of yourself. Secondly, tell her that you're very sorry about all of the things that are going on in her family and as a friend you will be more than happy to help when you can, but you also think it would be better for her to find a different daycare arrangement for the good of your friendship. Give her a few solid daycares to check out and a month to find another place for her children. That way you keep good feelings in tact, but have a deadline of freedom to look forward to. If she wants to talk about it further, don't be afraid to be tactfully and pleasantly honest.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

AxtRjMlGaa	Patti, first of all you are correct, in Germany my girlfriend loved visiting her family there because she could drink at 16 a pint of beer.<br>  My cousin was in the military and was in Germany and could drink on German soil, but not American soil. So the enlisted do drink, just not over here.<br>  I'm all for more education on any topic as long as it is age appropriate. I'm not sure if going back to 18 will help stop anything. The legal age is 21 and MADD has helped as far as punishment, but as Nana T says young adults will be young adults. You couldn't stop them in the 50's (My mom's main job on block parties was to interrupt sneaking drinking and corner necking)  and you can't stop them in 2K9. <br>  The best a parent can do is educate, communicate and hope as they leave off to college, military, or their first apartment, all you have instilled in them will be their conscience and their guide.|`|AA12128453	Yes the drinking age should be lowered to 18.  At first there would be problems, you'd have all kinds of 18 yr olds rushing to bars because it would be new and cool, but once society got used to it, then it would settle down.<br>  But if they came out with a drinking license, then they could connect it to high school like some states do.  Drop out of school, lose your license.  And no, GED's wouldn't count to get a drinking license.<br>  It would also let police use their resources for other things.

Personally I don't drink, but it would be interesting to do a study and see if that is true.|`|fc61095727fe8a17ac058f0c1b8e3bf2aa	I saw the program and liked the idea of the drinking license after they took classes on responsiblity and harmful physical effects. <br>  Military should definitely be allowed to drink. We trusted these 18 year olds to be mature enough to elect our president and they can sign contracts.

Maybe it will help teach responsibility !  Do you realize that at age 18 they become emancipated. They are usually out of school by that time, unless they go on to college. They can live on their own, join the military, marry, vote, even work in a strip joint and make porn movies !.These are legal because they are considered adults, according to the law !!  (wish I could underline those last 4 words !) So I say yes, go ahead and lower it. . . MADD will be mad. . . but who says the drinkers will be driving ? ? ? Cars should have those breathalyzers put in where it won't start if the person is drunk !!!  Not only teenagers drink and drive !!!    My favorite word comes into play here. . . EDUCATION !!!!  If they are an adult they should be allowed to drink, but be taught about drinking responsibly !!! 3 months before their 18th birthday they should attend classes and once they pass, be given a liqueur license that allows them to drink legally !   So many college students binge drink now. . why ?. . . because they think they are doing something illegal and can getting away with it !  This would eliminate it !  Some without a license may try it, but the ones who attended classes to get that license will be proud of it, and rat on the others !!!  LOL. . . So I say sure, lower it. . they drink now anyway. . . let's show them that responsibility goes along with it !!!!<br>  <br>  Edit. . Oh, I'd like to teach this class !!!

vs5rK3iRaa	I have never heard any explanation as to WHY African-Americans tip so low, but I know that this is not a hateful racist question because I've heard it so many times from different people, black waitresses included. Those people here who dismiss your question as being racist are just refusing to look at the facts.<br>  Statistically, the ranking that I have heard as far as good tipping is as follows (#1 being best):<br>  1) older white men<br>  2) white women<br>  3) younger white men<br>  4) black women<br>  5) black men<br>  I don't recall off the top of my head where other races/ethnicities fall into this list.

Money is not seen as a source of like and dislike in african american culture.  In white culture low tip=jerk or you must not like me; in african american culture low tip=maybe I have no job(african americans have a higher unemployment rate than whites so less likely to tip big especially in a recession when blacks generally feel recessions more than whites as they are the first to get fired and last to get hired).

ahS4TuSEaa	Science has never disproved the Bible, but continues to back it up time and time again. This is a massive topic worthy of a library of volumes all on its own. Let it suffice to give a few solid examples of science supporting the credibility of the Bible.<br>  <br>  Not a single finding has proven a cross between an ape or a human, a fish or a frog. No missing links have been found. Evolutionists used to believe that the earth was just a few million years old. But when they discovered how absurd it was to assume that things progress over time (instead of degenerating), with no evidence to back this assumption, they just added on a bunch of years. Now the earth is supposed to be 20 billion years old. What would the honest route have been?<br>  <br>  Darwin admitted that if the cell is more complex than he realized (and scientists knew very little about the cell in his day), his entire system has failed. Well, 100 years later scientists have discovered that the cell is not just a complex machine, but an entire city all by itself, and how it runs without any apparent help still boggles scientific brains. But instead of admitting Darwin’s error, evolutionists cling fast to their religious belief in evolution.<br>  <br>  Evolutionists begin with the presupposition that God does not exist, or that if He does, Genesis 1-2 cannot be taken literally. They also begin with the presupposition that evolution is correct before ever proving it. If someone begins with a premise, he will try to make all his findings support the premise regardless of the evidence.<br>  <br>  The entire concept of evolution flies in the face of proven fact. Psalm 102:25-27 says, "Of old You founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands. Even they will perish, but You endure; and all of them will wear out like a garment; like clothing You will change them and they will be changed; but You are the same, and Your years will not come to an end." This is the 2nd law of thermodynamics, also known as entropy. It means that everything is continually degenerating. Drop a handful of marbles and they scatter everywhere, illustrating nature’s magnetism toward chaos. Let a house sit for 500 years and the paint will peel, the porch will rot, and termites will make it look like a haunted mine. Hundreds of insects or microorganisms go instinct every day. The Bibles’ testimony of a degenerating earth is happening all around us, yet evolution teaches the very opposite: everything began with a cell and progresses from a primordial soup to higher and more sophisticated forms of life.<br>  <br>  Take the sun, for example. The earth is continually moving closer to the sun. At its current rate, 20 billion years back would put the earth so far from the sun that no animal or human life would be possible. The oceans would be ice cubes and life would be impossible.<br>  <br>  Take the moon. The moon collects a small amount of dust on its surface every year. It is over 20 feet deep. At the rate of its dust-collecting, if we go backwards, the moon would have no dust on it around 6-10,000 years ago. Why didn’t it collect dust for 10-15 billion years? Or does this once again confirm a young earth that the Bible supports?<br>  <br>  Take the earth’s sedimentary layers of rock and dirt, also called “strata.” Evolutionary scientists have observed earth strata, concluding that it took millions of years to collect. Then Mt. Helens exploded. The volcano created the same strata in a few days.<br>  <br>  Take the molecule. The likelihood of a single enzyme molecule developing through random processes is almost ridiculous. Imagine every square foot of the earth is covered with 95 pounds of protein molecules that could mix freely, and that these molecules are replaced with fresh protein molecules every year for one billion years. The probability that one enzyme molecule would be formed in one billion years in this state is one chance in 80 billion.<br>  <br>  Dr. Morowitz, an evolutionary scientist, calculated the probability for the formation of the smallest likely living organism by random processes. The likelihood is 10^340,000,000! That is once chance in 10 with 340 million zeroes. And get this: Dr. Morowitz still believed it happened!   It becomes painfully obvious that his commitment is not to the evidence, but to his religion of evolution, regardless of the facts.<br>  <br>  Imagine you are standing in line at Magic Mountain, the theme park, to enjoy the newest ride Scream! But before you board you notice a sign stating that the chances of this ride not crashing and exploding are 10 to the 340 millionth power. Would you ride?<br>  <br>  What the Experts Said...<br>  <br>  Evolution is a fairy tale for grown-ups. This theory has helped nothing in the progress of science. It is useless. ~ Professor Louis Bounoure, Director of Research, National Center of Scientific Research<br>  <br>  Evolution is unproved and unprovable. ~ Sir Arthur Keith (Sir Arthur Keith wrote the foreword to the 100th edition of Origin of the Species)<br>  <br>  I myself am convinced that the theory of evolution, especially the extent to which it’s been applied, will be one of the great jokes in history books of the future. ~ Malcolm Muggeridge, the famous British journalist and philosopher<br>  <br>  Scientists who go about teaching that evolution is a fact of life are great con-men, and the story they are telling may be the greatest hoax ever. ~ Dr. T. N. Tahmisian of the Atomic Energy Commission<br>  <br>  Classic evolution, theistic evolution, and every other kind of evolution boldly rush against all evidence, evidence that coincides beautifully with the testimony of the Bible. Looking at the Bible’s genealogy records, we can come to a very close dating of the earth, around 6-10 thousand years. Evolution is not science because it is not based on observation but speculation. It is theory—a theory that tries to explain away God Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth. Look into the history of science and you will see that science has always been observation of things now, not speculation into how they were brought into existence.<br>  <br>  As the theories of evolutionists swell in absurdity, and as its own strongest supporters begin to admit royal failure, it becomes increasingly obvious that they are running from the Creator they cannot escape. In Paul’s own words, “For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.  For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened” (Romans 1:20-21). Napoleon was right when he said, “Man will believe anything unless it’s in the Bible.”<br>  <br>  This is why humanity’s observation of nature will never be an objective judge of the credibility of the Bible. If you had to rest your destiny and purpose for existence on the Bible or man’s so-called scientific conclusions, which would you choose?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.collegelifeministry.com/node/34" rel="nofollow">http://www.collegelifeministry.com/node/...</a>|`|61a1bb75a10bf426d979acfca18b8d63aa	The Earth is only 6000 years or so old.

This is very possible, and even likely. It is only an assumption that integral or adjacent lead could only be an end product.<br>  <br>  In addition, common lead (lead 204), which has no radioactive parent, could easily be mixed into the sample and would seriously affect the dating of that sample. *Adolph Knopf referred to this important problem (*Scientific Monthly, November 1957). *Faul, a leading authority in the field, recognized it also (*Henry Faul, Nuclear Geology, 1954, p. 297).<br>  <br>  When a uranium sample is tested for dating purposes, it is assumed that the entire quantity of lead in it is "daughter-product lead" (that is, the end-product of the decayed uranium). The specimen is not carefully and thoroughly checked for possible common lead content, because it is such a time-consuming task. Yet it is that very uranium-lead ratio which is used to date the sample! The same problem applies to thorium samples.<br>  <br>  (2) Leaching is another problem. Part of the uranium and its daughter products could previously have leached out. This would drastically affect the dating of the sample. Lead, in particular, can be leached out by weak acid solutions.<br>  <br>  (3) There can be inaccurate lead ratio comparisons, due to different types of lead within the sample. Correlations of various kinds of lead (lead 206, 207, etc.) in the specimen is done to improve dating accuracy. But errors can and do occur here also.<br>  <br>  Thus, we have here astounding evidence of the marvelous unreliability of radiodating techniques. Rock known to be less than 300 years old is variously dated between 50 million and 14.5 billion years of age! That is a 14-billion year error in dating! Yet such radiodating techniques continue to be used in order to prove long ages of earth’s existence. A chimpanzee typing numbers at random could do as well.<br>  <br>  Sample datings from a single uranium deposit in the Colorado Caribou Mine yielded an error spread of 700 million years.<br>  <br>  (4) Yet a fourth problem concerns that of neutron capture. *Melvin Cooke suggests that the radiogenic lead isotope 207 (normally thought to have been formed only by the decay of uranium 235) could actually have been formed from lead 206, simply by having captured free neutrons from neighboring rock. In the same manner, lead 208 (normally theorized as formed only by thorium 232 decay) could have been formed by the capture of free neutrons from lead 207. Cooke checked out this possibility by extensive investigation and came up with a sizeable quantity of data indicating that practically all radiogenic lead in the earth’s crust could have been produced in this way instead of by uranium or thorium decay! This point alone totally invalidates uranium and thorium dating methods!<br>  <br>  (5) A fifth problem deals with the origin of the rocks containing these radioactive minerals. According to evolutionary theory, the earth was originally molten. But, if true, molten rocks would produce a wild variation in clock settings in radioactive materials.<br>  <br>  "Why do the radioactive ages of lava beds, laid down within a few weeks of each other, differ by millions of years?"—*Glen R. Morton, Electromagnetics and the Appearance of Age.<br>  <br>  It is a well-known fact, by nuclear researchers, that intense heat damages radiodating clock settings; yet the public is solemnly presented with dates of rocks indicating long ages of time when, in fact, the evolutionary theory of the origin of rocks would render those dates totally useless.<br>  <br>  2—THORIUM-LEAD DATING—A majority of the flaws discussed under uranium-lead dating, above, apply equally to thorium-lead dating.<br>  <br>  The half-lives of uranium 238, 235, and thorium 232 are supposedly known, having been theorized. But whenever dates are computed using thorium,—they always widely disagree with uranium dates! No one can point to a single reason for this. We probably have here a cluster of several major contamination factors; and all of these contamination factors are beyond our ability to identify, much less calculate. To make matters worse, contaminating factors common to both may cause different reactions in the thorium than in the uranium!

Amid opposition, conflict, and persecution, an all-wise providence was still at work in the upbuilding of Christ's kingdom. Satan exercised his power to hinder the work of God, by destroying the workmen; but as soon as one laborer was imprisoned, or slain, another was raised up to fill the vacancy. Despite all the opposing powers of evil, angels of God were doing their work, heavenly messengers were searching out men to stand as light-bearers amid the darkness. Notwithstanding the wide-spread apostasy, there were honest souls who had given heed to all the light which shone upon them. In their ignorance of God's word they had received the doctrines and traditions of men, but when the word was placed within their reach, they earnestly studied its pages, and in humility of heart they wept and prayed for a knowledge of God's will. With great joy they accepted the light of truth, and eagerly sought to impart light to their fellow-men. <br>  <br>       Through the labors of Wickliffe, Huss, and kindred workers, thousands of noble witnesses had borne testimony to the truth; yet at the beginning of the sixteenth century the darkness of ignorance and superstition still rested like a pall upon the church and the world. Religion was made to consist in a round of ceremonies, many of them borrowed from heathenism, and all devised by Satan to lead the minds of the people away from God and the truth. The worship of images and relics was still maintained. The Scriptural ordinance of the Lord's Supper was supplanted by the idolatrous sacrifice of the mass. Popes and priests claimed the power to forgive sins, and to open and close the gates of Heaven to all mankind. Senseless superstitions and rigorous exactions had taken the place of the true worship of God. The lives of popes and clergy were so corrupt, their proud pretensions so blasphemous, that good men trembled for the morality of the rising generation. With iniquity prevailing in the high places of the church, it seemed inevitable that the world would soon become as wicked as were the antediluvians or the inhabitants of Sodom.

Like Christian prayer (or any prayer), meditation can lead to more skillful ways of conducting your life and thinking about things.  It's a very practical way to explore yourself and your relation to others.<br>  Check out Stephen Bachelor's book Buddhism Without Beliefs.<br>  I did not abandon my Chrisitanity when I explored Buddhism, but you have to follow your path wherever it leads.  Buddhism enhanced how I perceived Christ and his message, but it did lead me away from organized and institutional religion.<br>  Good luck with your exploration!|`|uUCTem2Eaa	Read the Dhammapada.

4uike3ARaa	I do not agree that people are suddenly really rude on here.<br>  People have been really rude on here for quite some time.|`|17fc727d7da626634a4721e34bc49363aa	Yep.  You should check out the political section.  There is no shortage of rude, opinionated jerks here who feel safe behind their keyboards.  I'd punch a lot of noses if they dared behave that way in person, but a coward safe in his mom's basement thinks he can get away with anything, and he can until he crosses a line that brings the FBI down on him.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes I wonder why I bother with YA, with all of the rude people.  I usually answer homework questions for English, history or political students.|`|YLuHUgBbaa	It's people who have nothing better to do with their time.<br>  I once asked a question concerning health, I'd had a cold or something, and someone had the nerve to say that I had cancer and was going to die.<br>  These are the sad people with no lives, and quite frankly you should feel sorry for them|`|UOIcXs7Haa	That's nothing new, they're usually kids that shouldn't be on the site anyway.|`|AA10451488	Sure, a bit more of that going on lately. <br>  I've also noticed a serious rash of "thumbs down" too - that is sort of getting to me lately.

VywQUGldaa	Ok, from what you describe, yeah... i'd date you... unless of course there's some kinda horn growing outa your forehead or something.  The only bad thing i see in the description you listed is that you made a bad choice for a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Here's a clue bud.... a boyfriend, current OR ex, who would call you fat, is doing so to try to make himself feel better, or make you feel bad. or some crap like that... either way, thats a form of abuse.  You need to realize that he said that not because you are fat, but because he's an @$$ from waaaayyyyy back.<br>  <br>  Now, incidentally... 5'10 & 185 lbs is NOT fat... actually, sounds kinda hot to tell the truth.  Leave the butt-wipe ex boyfriend where he belongs... IN YOUR PAST... as well as anything he ever said to you and any criticism he ever had of you.  Step out and find yourself a good man... read that again... a GOOD man... there are plenty of us out there waiting for you to come along!!|`|HtKKcq98aa	Posting pictures would be more helpful.<br>  Are you sure it was the weight that was the problem?<br>  Some people may use that as an excuse to hurt other peoples feelings but maybe you have a rotten personality or you have bad body odor?<br>  <br>  Regardless if your cute despite your so called "pudge" then i don't see why you would have trouble finding a boyfriend. And it does help that you do like yourself too, i've met so many guys (and i'm guilty of this too) that are so negative and act all bitchy and junk|`|0a3365e60ed6ac719c848e7eee088ff9aa	Their is someone for everyone, personally I don't mind a little beer belly. If it doesn't bother you then who cares what your ex says, hes your ex for a reason. If your comfortable with how you look then find someone who is comfortable with it too, believe me they are out their. I dated a gym rat who was obsessed with working out, he was really into his looks, in the end he was a crappy boyfriend a lousy lay and got a bad case of early male pattern baldness, all areas that the gym couldn't help him in.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	If you were attractive enough, I could overlook the stomach... Remember, you have to have a pretty face or a nice body!|`|UbvglIS6aa	Although I like a guy to look good, I wouldn't necessarily refuse to go out with someone who was a bit "pudgy".  I would base my decision on whether I liked him or not.  If you think being overweight is causing you problems, then maybe you could start a program of diet and exercise to get into shape.  <br>  <br>  As for your EX, he seems a bit insensitive.  If he says mean things often, maybe you should avoid him.|`|aH0yYcTIaa	I would! I'm about the same size and a little tummy can be cute|`|963d63f6d3d4458368e99dbfe9b34914aa	Sounds fine to me. He's an asshole for calling you fat. Last time a kid did that to me, I wasn't fat, about the same as you, only 6'1, so I started working out hardcore, and didn't talk to him, lost 20 pounds in like 2 months. (He was my motivator)<br>  <br>  Next time I saw him, his jaw almost fell off, and it was the sweetest revenge, because I never did anything mean back in return.|`|3RQkgTSOaa	I can imagine that at 5"10 185 lbs. you might look a little strange, kind of like a rather large pancake (sorry, I just couldn't resist... I'm bad. I'll behave now...) I'm 5'10" and 190 but I'm working on getting back in shape so we probably kinda look alike... except for the eyes. Mine are brown. I tend to go for 'men' rather than 'boyz.' That shaved/plucked look with perfect everything I find kind of annoying (or maybe I'm just jealous). So, yeah, depending on how you're put together, I might go out with you.|`|o9cAl8xhaa	I would.<br>  <br>  A lot of guys like a man with some meat on him.|`|4KNESOnlaa	Go to chubbychasers.com...they love chubby guys over there...I'm not into it.....
3RQkgTSOaa	OK, let's not condemn EVERYBODY because of the behavior of a few loose screws (so to speak.)<br>  <br>  The specificity of your first question is a little limiting. I live in greater Chicago and obviously I would be of no help to you advising you about guys in Tennessee. The people here on Y!A come from all over and your chance of randomly finding someone who knows someone in Claiborne County is probably not that great. So people resort to insults, jests and sophomoric answers. Had your question been a little more general in nature ("How do I go about feeling better after a bad break-up?") you might have received some more constructive answers. Not that that's any excuse but I'm wagering that's why you got the feedback you did.<br>  <br>  As for your abusive boyfriend: I don't know what your question was but no one deserves to be abused in the name of love (unless you like that kind of thing). Time to say goodbye to bad boyfriends and try to find something new.<br>  <br>  I'm no geography major but if you find yourself in a more remote part of the state, I might suggest traveling to the closest large city where concentrations and acceptance of gay people is a little higher. Often with small communities because everyone knows everyone else's business, gay people are loathe to let their neighbors know what they're all about. And for good reason.<br>  <br>  Good luck. And don't h8 Y!A just because some jerks gave you a hard time. Roll with the punches, my friend, and take things in stride. H8 and resentment become their own rewards if you're not careful.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|DWwv3v9Raa	Some of these answers you have to take with a grain of salt. You can't let your emotions play into these responses because some people are just cruel by nature. Don't take their response to heart, just ignore the ignorant ones.

I'm all the way in NY, can't help you there...|`|RPpXarDDaa	no one answered your question because they didn't have an answer...sensitive much?|`|LL6aVCp8aa	Don't be so quick to lose faith in the service.My guess is that you will find the answer you are seeking if you have a little patience|`|AA11288692	Then why bother posting? Stop being dramatic. Read the clues. Read what your writing.

Try craigslist.org or maybe gay.com|`|UbvglIS6aa	Since I'm here in Texas, I can't help you.  <br>  <br>  As for your abusive boyfriend, I suggest you get away from him, get a restraining order on him, and find someplace to live (like a shelter) until you can make enough money to move into a place of your own.

In this case, two things stand out: Will Ann Coulter go to Heaven when she dies, and Is she really a man?<br>  <br>  I have looked on Wikipedia, Google, and her personal website, and have not found anything that even remotely implies that she was or is a man.<br>  <br>  The question assumes Ann Coulter will go to Heaven, but that doesn't necessarily mean she will. Mind you, from her statements I personally believe she will go to Heaven, but I am simply reminding everyone that Christians believe the only way into Heaven is to accept Christ as the only way to purge your sins. From this definition and her own comments, I believe she will. Many other sects and religions believe she will not go to Heaven (or paradise) because she does not do what they believe to be the way to Heaven or paradise. In other words, the only way for anyone else to know if Ann Coulter will enter Heaven will be after she dies and is seen there.<br>  <br>  Now, let us assume that Ann Coulter does enter Heaven, that she is a man, and she is meeting St. Peter at the perlescent gate. Will she have to explain her gender identity? Some say yes and some say no, and there is no universal concensus. Personally, I believe that once a person enters Heaven, they shall know all they ever needed to know. However, assuming she has to explain herself, she would have to tell the truth and nothing but, as there can be no sin in Heaven.<br>  <br>  A little long, perhaps, but I hope this helped.|`|i3lXJbtFaa	Oh...

Her action was not the first of its kind: Irene Morgan, in 1946, and Sarah Louise Keys, in 1955, had won rulings before the Supreme Court and the Interstate Commerce Commission respectively in the area of interstate bus travel. But unlike these previous individual actions of civil disobedience, Parks' action sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott.<br>  <br>  Parks's act of defiance became an important symbol of the modern Civil Rights Movement and Parks became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation. She organized and collaborated with civil rights leaders, including boycott leader Martin Luther King, Jr., helping to launch him to national prominence in the civil rights movement.<br>  <br>  She refused to give her seat to a white man.

But praise God for His mercy! The Lord had help me get rid of all that "religious junk" so that I could be filled. And two months after my conversion, during a Sunday night service, while singing in the back row of the church choir, God gloriously baptized me with the Holy Ghost with the initial physical evidence of speaking in other tongues! I was so thrilled and happy that I ran out of the service, and around the building three times before I really realized where I was.

This is why we have charlatans like Oral Roberts and Jim Baker living in mansions and begging people for money.<br>  <br>  In their haste to make a dollar, the Charismatics consistently ignore the fact that Jesus said these were SIGNS, and that I Corinthians 1:22 tells us that SIGNS are for the JEWS. Israel began with signs (Rom. 4:11; Exo. 4:8 ,9, 17, 23, 28, 30; 7:3; 8:23; 10:1-2; 13:9; 31:13, 17; Deu. 4:34; 6:22), lived by signs (Deu. 11:18; Jos. 4:6; I Sam. 10:7; II Kgs. 19:29; Isa. 7:14; 38:7, 22; Eze. 4:3; 20:12, 20), and demanded signs from Christ (Mat. 12:38; 24:3). [ADVICE TO READERS: Everything that can be misunderstood WILL be misunderstood when you fail to check references.] There is more scripture to support the doctrine of signs being for Israel than there is to support the Virgin Birth and the Inspiration of Scripture combined! Anyone who ignores this truth is absolutely unqualified to teach, preach, or write anything about the Apostolic Signs. If you'll take a look at Hebrews 2:3-4 you will see that the signs were used to CONFIRM the word of God, and you will also see that the signs are spoken of in the PAST TENSE. They are also spoken of in the past tense in II Corinthians 12:12. Those who insist that we should practice the signs today because they were practiced throughout the New Testament haven't been reading (or believing) their Bible. They were not practiced throughout the New Testament. In fact, Paul left Trophimus SICK at Miletum (II Tim. 4:20); he gave Timothy medical advice instead of healing him (I Tim. 5:23), and he had infirmities of his own from which he could not be healed (II Cor. 11:30; 12:5-10). Now why all this sickness if the Apostolic Signs were still in effect? Answer: They WEREN'T still in effect, because they were only needed in the early ministry of the Apostles for the purpose of confirming the truth to Israel. <br>  <br>  Now we firmly believe that God can still work miracles and heal anyone He chooses, and we believe that the prayers of God's people can move Him to work miracles, but let's not confuse answered prayers with Apostolic Signs, because there's a vast difference. We believe in healing; we just don't believe in healers.<br>  <br>  You say, "Well what about speaking in unknown tongues through the Holy Ghost? Do you deny that people today speak in unknown tongues?" No, of course not. People have spoken in unknown tongues for thousands of years. Ever read Genesis 11? Was that an outpouring of the Holy Ghost? When the Church of Satan speaks in unknown tongues (which they do), is that a work of the Holy Ghost? When a psychologist can have you blubbering in unknown tongues within fifteen minutes, is that an outpouring of the Holy Ghost? You see, too many people have the idea that if something is highly abnormal or miraculous that it MUST be of God. The coming Antichrist will have a field day with such feeble minded people, because HE will work such "signs and lying wonders" that the entire world will follow after him (II Ths. 2:8-12; Rev. 13:13-14). <br>  <br>  Nowhere in the New Testament did God command anyone to speak with unknown tongues. We do read about "new tongues" (Mar. 16:17), "other tongues" (Acts 2:4) and "divers kinds of tongues" (I Cor. 12:10), but these are all FOREIGN LANGUAGES, not senseless gibberish! There are no unknown tongues in Acts 2, and there is no baptism of the Holy Ghost in I Corinthians 14. Instead of rightly dividing the word of truth, the careless Charismatics wrest the scriptures to their own destruction by ignoring the set divisions and doctrines that the Holy Spirit has inspired in the scriptures. The Apostolic Signs are not for today, because they were only for confirming the word of God to the unbelieving Jews in the first century. The Bible warns us to beware of anyone who professes to practice these signs today (II Cor. 11:13-15; Mat. 7:15; 24:11; I Tim. 4:1-2), and the Lord commends the church at Ephesus for trying out some professing apostles and finding them to be LIARS (Rev. 2:2).|`|XTyAMS5yaa	Well technically English is a tongue (or language) so ever since I was...say, 1 or 2....

If you are loving others more than yourself then you are not understanding this command, love your neighbor as yourself.<br>  Now what about if you do not love yourself what then is it that we are to do??<br>  Maybe let others love us until we do??|`|lywRBk4Kaa	Everyone has their gifts, yours' is apparently knowing what you truly need and do not need.  You yield that which you do not NEED for others who seem to think they need it.  This is a gift, mental and spiritual safety from one of the many human faults.  Do not change a thing as far as this topic goes.  Good luck.|`|jAPBNtMKaa	I had a gf like that once.|`|AA11282654	Because they are "Holier than Thou".

If they moved in without a plan, they shouldn't be surprised you made one for them.  Let them pout all they want.  They're grown-ups and will have to have personal and financial responsibility at some point, and better to learn it while young.  <br>  <br>  They cannot possibly find work if they are sleeping through business hours.  They can't think you're so gullible.  Since they are computer savvy, there should be a number of job sites and corporate sites they can be visiting on a daily basis for new listings.  If they were as diligent with the search as they were in trying to attain world domination, or whatever the Warcraft goal is, they would be eating high on the hog.  Don't feel bad if they start crying homelessness and poverty.  This is a bed of their own making, not just mooching from you, but even by not showing any gratitude by helping out wherever they can.  If it causes a family rift, so be it.  You're doing them a favor.<br>  <br>  The deadline is almost here and it will be over soon.  If they try to talk you into an extension, that would be the time for a sit-down.  Tell them exactly what will be expected of them.  Write it down and have them sign it, including responsibility for past rent and going forward.  If they make a legal committment to you (not that verbal isn't legal, but just harder to prove) they may see the buffet is closed and they really do need to take charge of their lives.|`|niLvdq0Qaa	This is indeed very unfortunate. It is going to cause a problem between the two brothers, and it will be all your fault.<br>  There is nothing you can do now--the rules of the house should of been laid down and understood before they moved in.<br>  The only thing I can suggest is:<br>  Deal with the issue until the time for them to move.<br>  Pack up all of their belongings and place them outside the door for them to pick up immediately. Change lock on the door.<br>  This is your home--if they have paid the rent until the end of Feb.--fine-out by March 1st. I would forget the extra 7 days--they may retaliate against you and while you are gone damage some of your belongings of even steal some of them.<br>  They have shone undo-disrespect towards you and your fiance and it is still continuing. I would be prepared for any emotional issues this may cause between the brothers.<br>  Hope this all goes well for you, I know how difficult it is, I had to pack up one of my daughters stuff and throw her out of my house.|`|JpRBvUobaa	You have EVERY right to chuck them out!!!! Get them out of your house ... the freeloaders!!! DISGUSTING|`|1fd9957e2ec9a7bf90a8eb7c7c9d3c47aa	At the beginning, there should have been house rules set down. I think it's quite lazy of this couple not to pick up after themselves and very selfish and rude of them to not even offer to chip in to help clean the house when you and your fiance very generously gave them a place to stay. I guess they thought as long as they were paying rent, it automatically included maid srevice?? That is unbelieveable. They are both taking advantage of the situation. Nevermind the silent treatment, look on it as a good thing. Stick to the deadline that you and your fiance have set for them to leave your home and make sure they are out by that date. Where they choose to go after that shouldn't be your concern. Don't feel guilty about it either, they brought this on themselves.|`|UMYda9Jaaa	What a tough situation! There are two things I wonder about: despite Brian and Kathy's joblessness do they still pay rent faithfully and when they are up all night do they keep you from sleeping? As long as they are paying rent and you are able to get a good night's sleep, I would say that the hours they sleep and the jobs they get are entirely their business.<br>  <br>  As for cleaning, in my own roommate experiences, I cleaned up my own things and didn't touch any of theirs. For example, I washed my dishes, dusted and vaccuumed my areas, put away my things, did my own laundry, etc. and left theirs alone. That way, they had to take full responsibility for their things just as I took full responsibility for mine. Also, for future references, I would set up a responsibility chart before move-in with new roommates. Together, decide what rules are fair and whose responsibility it is to do which chores and when. Have everyone sign and date this contract and make sure each person has a copy. That way everyone has a say and expectations are clear from the start.<br>  <br>  At this point, I would apologize and suggest starting over with a contract such as the one I mentioned above. If Brian and Kathy refuse to respond, ignore them and continue living as you would if they weren't there. (If they stay in their bedroom and still pay $400 a month, wwhy would you care?) If they don't pay their rent and don't leave within a reasonable time, talk to your landlord and have them evicted.|`|uszV7NEFaa	Wow well, I think that you should have set rules for them when they first moved in. I share an apartment with my childhood friend and we decided that  we both clean the house....I do her dishes and mine and she does the same we both clean the bathroom and my fiance cleans too when he visits me. We always take decisions based on the fact that it's not MY place, but OUR place. the best you can do is tell them to go somewhere else. They sound like real lazy and inconsiderate people. They will try to make you feel guilty but don't give in.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!
