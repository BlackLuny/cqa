AA10590885	Everything is negotiable. I would much rather give a break to a stellar tenant than to one giving me problems.  If there is a glut of housing in your area you have a good chance of getting it held or even reduced (It is worth a try). The apartments in my area are so starved for tenants that they are offering all sorts of deals just to get the place filled - that may be your bargaining chip - you could go elsewhere for a better deal.<br>  You pay on time - you are a long time resident - and your wages probably are not going up due to the economy and you could use the break.  No need for tears, just the facts mam.|`|5veU5nSwaa	1st of all you should be upset about the leak, constant moisture causes mold! Address it immediatley! Secondly there really isn't anything you can do to convince them not to raise your rent it is completely up to them.|`|pNy8lakjaa	Simply remind them of the cost of a vacancy, cleaning up the apartment, looking for a new person to rent, how long will the place go unoccupied, while you are off spending your hard earned dollars elsewhere since they didn't keep you happy.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	A large apartment complex is a lot less likely to let you negotiate no rent increases than if you were renting a condo or something from an individual owner. Rental complexes expect churn and factor in a certain amount of vacancies at any given time to their bottom line. Having a few units be vacant doesn't hurt them as much financially as it does the owner of one rental. <br>  <br>  In fact, if it's been 2-1/2 years, they would probably welcome you moving out so they can do some renovations on it (that leak in the bedroom, for example), spruce it up (new paint and carpet, maybe even remodel it), and get a lot more in monthly rent than you're paying now. So, even threatening to let the lease expire if they don't keep your rent the same for another lease term might not persuade them to not raise your rent.<br>  <br>  I have a couple of rental condos and would be willing to work with the tenants if the alternative was to have them leave instead of renewing the lease. But, that's because those rent payments pay the mortgage every month. And, I would have to dip into my savings to cover it when the unit was vacant.
PA7kYyAxaa	Your report (and all of your business dealings) should be full, complete and accurate. If there are errors, notify the reporting agency and get them corrected. Do not delay.|`|T6V9zXymaa	Michelle,<br>  <br>  You may be in luck, actually! You should contact the credit reporting agencies and ask them to correct the information. There's a possibility that entries with incorrect data will be expunged from your credit report.<br>  <br>  Understand, I say a "possibility" because it's just as likely they will update the data but leave it in your credit report. Still, for the cost of an envelope and a stamp you have a chance to remove that info with very little effort.<br>  <br>  I'd definitely recommend giving it a try. From personal experience, I had two negative accounts removed from my credit report this way and one that was corrected but not removed.

W5IL92lkaa	Unless "The Bank" (in this case Toyota Credit) requires that you have a down payment, you shouldn't have to put any money down.<br>  <br>  Why? - When financing a vehicle the bank will decide to extend you a certain amount for your loan. If they are willing to finance the entire purchase price, then you aren't required to put any money down.<br>  <br>  Buyer Beware!!  - If the dealership is pressuring you to come up with a down payment, be sure to look over your paperwork very carefully. In some cases the down payment will not go against your loan at all, instead the dealer will take it as pure profit.<br>  <br>  The bottom line - If you don't need to put any money down...DON'T.<br>  <br>  The only way money down will help you, is by decreasing your monthly payments.

rPwqJBL2aa	Yes that's true - your credit score is a measure of how well you use credit. If you remove the "credit" from the equation, then of course the score will go down. I know it seems like someone responsible enough to have no debt is responsible enough to loan money to, but unfortunately that's not how our financial market works.<br>  <br>  It might impact your ability to get a loan in the future. Loaners want to see a history of charges and on-time payments. To them, someone who has debt but always pays on time is much more enticing than someone who never got into debt in the first place.<br>  <br>  My recommendation would be to keep (or get?) one credit card and use it for your daily purchases. Stay in your budget and pay it off each month so that you never have to pay interest. That way, your credit score will grow but you won't be paying interest to a credit company.|`|0rBEqVtHaa	1. If you have a high balance to credit available then your credit score will be affected negatively. <br>  2. If you have had a credit card account but end up closing it then your credit score will be affected negatively. <br>  <br>  My suggestion would've been for you to pay off the balance but to keep the account open. This will definitely help your credit score.<br>  <br>  But isn't it a little retarded since you have to have a credit card (other debt) in order to improve your credit score? I think it's really wrong.

By investing now at 23 rather than later, you will have much more time to have your investment to grow.<br>  <br>  Supposing that you invest in the stock market, you could take advantage of the low prices that are currently in effect.  There will be market volatility, but since you're looking at a long term investment (or at least you should), you will have ample opportunity to have the investment grow over time. <br>  <br>  For example, the Dow is currently at it's lowest point in about 12 years.

Always include risk when you are determining rate of return.<br>  <br>  2. Since you lack the expertise of managing investment risk, build a base of low risk (boring) investments first and then work your way up.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, at 23, you should be looking farther out than 15 years -- more like 30 to 40.

hdZ953cFaa	I think you're saying that your mother claimed you as her dependent on her tax return so she could get the dependent credit.  If you fit the criteria (age, living with her, enrollment in school, etc.) then she has the legal right to claim you.  Irregardless of what she did, you still must file your own tax return.  Your income is probably low enough that you will get all of your withheld taxes back as a refund.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	If you mean she claimed you as a dependent but she was not legally entitled to do so, then you need to go ahead and file your own return, including the exemption for yourself.

O8qdCBzLaa	Foreclosures can be tricky, moreso than people think. And, tax foreclosures have their own set of issues that can pop up.<br>  <br>  The foremost thing to consider with any kind of foreclosure is that the seller (bank or lienholder) does not have to submit a transfer disclosure statement (TDS) as a condition of the sale. In a conventional purchase transaction, the seller must submit a TDS, which is basically an affidavit describing all known conditions, faults or issues with the property known to the seller at that time. <br>  <br>  Almost all conventional purchase offers say that they are contingent upon acceptance of the contents of the TDS. And, if if the buyer is not satisfied with the issues in the TDS, he can back out of the deal with no panalty (he gets his deposit back). Or, he can negotiate discrepancies with the seller in the form of a lower offer price or a repair allowance, or he can require the seller to remedy the discrepancy prior to the deal going through.<br>  <br>  If a seller does not disclose some issue about the property that he knew of and the buyer discovers this discrepancy after the sale, the buyer can sue the seller and the selling agent for monetary damages of at least what it would cost to remedy the situation.<br>  <br>  Since the seller of a foreclosure does not have to submit a TDS, it's up to the buyer to do whatever inspections or research it takes to verify the condition of the property, including the structural integrity of the property, all liens on the property, any code violations known by the city, future plans for imminent domain, etc. And, if he ends up buying the property, he just bought any and all problems that are associated with it, and it's the buyer's responsibility to remedy those issues at his expense.<br>  <br>  The additional problem that you can have with a tax foreclosure is that the mortgage holder might have a lien on the property for the amount of the unpaid mortgage. But, the county tax collector foreclosed first and seized the property before the lender could foreclose. So, by paying off the tax lien and acquiring the property for "pennies on the dollar," the buyer must pay off the mortgage lien before they can have clear title on the property.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Simple answer: No. If you buy a foreclosure now, there's no assurance of a buffer if prices drop.<br>  <br>  Longer answer: It depends on the value of the home you buy. Just because it's a foreclosure doesn't mean it's a bargain. Example: A house sold for $500,000 in 2006. Now it's a foreclosure and on the market at $350,000. Your question: Is that enough of a buffer?<br>  <br>  Not only is that not a buffer but, depending on the true value of the home, you may be overpaying. In this example, I know plenty of houses that were sold for $500,000 in 2006. And last year they were on the market as foreclosures at $350,000. Problem is, the market had dropped to about $325,000. So you would have been overpaying then. Prices have now dropped for those same houses to about $290,000.<br>  <br>  Understand: There's nothing special about foreclosures. Nothing. After the bank takes the home, it puts it back on the market. Usually, it prices it based on what's called a "BPO" or "broker's price opinion." It's like a quickie estimate by a real estate agent of what the property is worth. It's certainly not an appraisal. Often, it's not even a full-blown CMA (competitive market analysis) performed by a real estate agent. As a result, BPOs are often inaccurate. Sometimes they're low, but too often they're high. The bank's headquarters may be thousands of miles away, and all they have to base the value on is a quickie BPO, for which the real estate agent may have been paid $25-$50.<br>  <br>  So, before you buy a foreclosure (or any house) have your own agent do a CMA on the property.<br>  <br>  And in the case of foreclosures, understand that you're buying the house in "as is" condition. That means the seller--the bank--isn't going to do any repairs. So if the house needs new carpeting or a new roof, or there are holes punched in the wall or water damage in the basement, it's your responsibility. That means you have factor in the repair costs, plus a "fudge factor" in any offer you make.<br>  <br>  Yes, some foreclosures can be bargains. Meanwhile, many aren't.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|AA11173563	look there is no guarantees in any thing out there. If you are ready to buy then buy and be happy with your purchase. If you will foreclose like so many others who loose equity then do not buy you are not emotionally ready to buy

AA11616170	My credit union in Ireland does not do foreign exchange.  Banks vary in their exchange rates, (you could ask by phone and then decide) and many post offices do a bureau de change, though the rate may not be as favourable.<br>  <br>  By the way, if you get someone over 60 to do the transaction for you, for some of the banks these are Golden Years customers, and don't get charged a transaction fee, just the exchange rate.  I did this buying a sterling draft recently, and was pleased to keep the difference in my pocket.|`|uBtWPy7Gaa	Exchange rates are NOT the same everywhere. They vary alot depending on where you convert it from. <br>  <br>  Generally the high street banks will give a very poor rate of exchange.

2N6oTOLQaa	No matter what, you get a standard deduction of $5700. That means the first $5700 you make is completely tax free. <br>  <br>  If someone else (probably your parents) can legally claim  you on their taxes, you'll pay 10% on the remaining $300 or about $30 total in federal income taxes. <br>  <br>  If nobody else can claim you as a dependent on their taxes, then you'll also get the personal exemption, which allows you to make an additional $3650 tax free. if this is the case you'd pay no federal taxes at all. <br>  <br>  Note, the first answer is correct, but the numbers they used were from 2008. I have provided info based on the 2009 numbers as they currently stand.

5BTKscZraa	STAY AWAY from any "debt consolidation" program that involves debt settlement. Debt settlement is a risky tactic where you pay a monthly fee to a debt consolidator....this entire fee goes towards building a settlement account and to the consolidator's fees to “settle” your accounts in the future. Your credit card companies will deliberately not be paid so that all the accounts will default/charge-off so that they can attempt settlements at around 50%. If you are current on your accounts, this process will ruin your credit rating for sure. Debt settlement is like a roll off the dice with your finances...You can never predict how your creditors will respond to the deliberate defaulting of your accounts...they might settle at 50%...or they might serve you a summons, take you to court...and if they win, you could be looking at wage garnishment.<br>  <br>  You could enter a Debt Management Plan (DMP) with a non-profit credit counselor like CCCS (Consumer Credit Counseling Services). They can negotiate lower payments and interest rates. They do not negotiate settlements.<br>  <br>  They will require you to stop using all credit and to cut up your cards. Your credit report will be updated to "enrolled in debt management." This does not damage your credit, but it may make it impossible to obtain new credit while you are enrolled in their program....so don't use this service if you anticipate applying for a new apartment, car loan or mortgage anytime soon, as you would probably be denied while you're enrolled in the CCCS debt management program.... Otherwise, it can be a very good way to deal with your debt.  Please note that CCCS cannot perform miracles in situations where there is an overwhelming level of debt relative to your income/assets.|`|Q7IthmTFaa	Might want to read Dave Ramsey's "Total Money Makeover"-get it at the library.  It tells how to start snowballing on debt.|`|MFFwll7taa	The credit card debt consolidation option that will work for you depends on personal factors, such as the amount of debt you have, your current credit rating and how important that is to you, and whether or not you have equity in a home. With good credit and no equity, a possible option is to see if you qualify for an unsecured loan for your credit card debt consolidation. If you are unable to get an acceptable unsecured loan, and you have no equity in a home, options such as debt settlement or credit counseling could be the way to go. As per my experience I recommend you go for Freedom Debt Relief, Their debt reduction program helped me lower my credit card debt levels.|`|qjsXrMfHaa	If you will like to become debt free soon then you should try settling you debt. Debt Settlement is where your debt gets negotiate in order for you to pay back a lower percentage of what you originally owe. You will achieve savings anywhere from 50-70%. In other words you would be paying back your creditor 30-50 cents on the dollar. If your accounts are slightly or significantly delinquent at this point then making settlements is going to have a direct improvement on your credit because it will show that these accounts are resolved. There are some companies that will require a monthly payment but there are also companies that will tell you to save that money in a personal checking account that will be 100% under you name and your control only instead of you sending monthly payments. If I was you, I would rather go with a company that lets me be in control of my money because I know that my money is save all times, instead of going with a company that requires monthly payments that 1. will charge at types of fees if I cannot send the money on time or send the amount agreed, so in a way they are like the creditors and 2. at any time the company may disappear with my money so now you will be into more debt. A great thing about debt settlement is regards to your credit score is that it will start to increase as the accounts get settled. When you complete the program, your credit score will not be perfect because you used a third part to help you but it will be decent and you can always do a credit restoration if you would like your credit score to increase quickly. Before you join a company, please make sure you check their BBB rating to make sure that they have an excellent rating (A+) and that they have been in business for many years. Please keep in mind that just before you call a company to ask for information, does not mean that you are committing to it.

H17L1WW4aa	Okay to answer a few things of what you have mentioned.  Depending on the loan you may or may not have a right to get a copy of your appraisal.  You pay for the appraisal on behalf of the lender, only on a FHA loan are they required to give you a copy.  Saying that I always give a copy of any appraisal to the client (even though on 80% of the loans its not required).  To make the point simple its not your appraisal.<br>  <br>  Per the 4.625% rate you need that crap in writing.  If the lender changed the rate you shouldnt have closed.  Im not saying its your fault but all borrowers should be ready to call another lender at all times.  Rates change up to 3 times a day.  But I give you another example, you call a broker and say what is the rate for a 30 year fixed.    So idiots will just quote you the best rate possible.  This assumes you loan is over 250K, your fico is over 750, you lock that very second, you can close in less then 10 days.  They arent real rates.  When the real loan comes in its less then 250K, your fico is under 750, you need a 30 day lock.  Now your rate is 5.5% instead of the 4.625% that was quoted.  This is called a bait and switch.  It happens all the time and it never should.  Should be illegal for anybody to quote a rate over the phone until your loan is totally approved with any addons that happen all the time.<br>  <br>  Basically it sounds like your broker is an idiot.  I would report them too.  I just am not sure if anything will happen.

LOrFtSCHaa	There is a book that will help you a ton, it is the total money makeover by dave ramsey, in it he teaches the basics of budgeting and answers how you can pay off the debt with the income you have.  But to answer your question, first and foremost.  <br>  <br>  here is the budget desing I use, <br>  <br>  Income:<br>  Balance Forward Cash $ (cash in the bank you already have)<br>  Payroll Deposit $<br>  Other Deposits $<br>  Sub Total <br>  <br>  Expenses:  (this will depend on when you pay them) (mine look different for each pay period) <br>  <br>  Rent <br>  Utilities <br>  Food <br>  Transportation <br>  Credit Cards<br>  <br>  Savings <br>  Miscelaneous<br>  Entertainment <br>  Sub Total <br>  <br>  Total Income - Expenses <br>  <br>  What you do first is plan to do a Zero based budget is where every dollar has a name, then, adjusted as needed.  Remember you drive the budget in the begining then, you get discipline enough to follow it and not go over in the categories.  Once you have all bills accounted for start by saving up to $500, this will be your emergency fund.  After start using every little amount extra a payperiod to add to your credit cards (make sure you list the cards lowest to largest)  and start paying them off one at a time, making sure you pay extra on the first one and minimum payments on the rest.  Once you pay off the first one you roll that money into the next card (this is called the snowball method).  For a better explanation get the book at the library.|`|Uc7GM2Rnaa	Well the good news is that the items listed above is less than what you make.  <br>  <br>  I do wonder about your utility bill though.  it is double your rent.

O8qdCBzLaa	In the UK, freehold ownership is the full outright ownership of the land and property, whereas leasehold is the right to occupy a property for a certain period of time, known as the lease 'term'. Long leases can extend to 999 years in the UK. And, these are sometimes referred to as "virtual freehold". <br>  <br>  What they're offering for ￡140,000 is the ability to use the land as though you and your heirs owned it for the next 973 years, after which time it reverts back to the original owner's heirs. That means you can build on it, sell structures on the property, or sublet part of the property, with the understanding that any structures in place at the end of the lease term go to the heirs of the original owner.<br>  <br>  I guess this is done to get money now and still have the property in your family, but not for another 973 years. By this time, the land will have been improved upon and may even be an entire town or city, if the property is big enough. Or, it might eventually have some great castle built upon it that will have some great value to the owner's heirs by then.<br>  <br>  This seems like a bizarre concept, particularly since my country isn't even 250 years old yet. But, I guess in a country as old as England, they've had time to work out how something like a 973-year "virtual freehold" lease would work over time.|`|AA11899639	a 973year lease--none of us will be here|`|gimSkk6jaa	Very curious lease. Does the property return to an organization / charity or a private party  (potential family lineage)? However, maybe more importanty, does the property return to the seller in certain conditions, such as lapsed insurance policy? will banks write a mortgage on such a lease at all since it is not owned outright?

The tools and tutorials available in these programs leave a lot to be desired. They promise fantastic commissions but have poor converting websites and then when nothing happens the affiliate moves on to another product to sell and then just continues to bounce from one product to another meaning that he/she never earns at bean. At least this was the scenario i encountered.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, the best way to learn this business is to learn from other master affiliates. If you can find programs run by affiliates with lots of tutorials, support, cutting edge tools and above all good converting products, you are on to a good thing. These are people who have succeeded in this business.<br>  <br>  Next, there should be no reason for you to pay anything to get involved with these products or programs. Many of these free programs have an optional paid upgrade and that's fine, we're all in this to make money ultimately, but you will be able to check out the programs for free and quickly make an informed decision as to whether it's your 'thing'.<br>  <br>  A great resource i found is an affiliate 'school' called Affilarama. You can check it out here <a href="http://www.leadsleap.com/go/18623" rel="nofollow">http://www.leadsleap.com/go/18623</a> . This is totally free to join and gives you excellent tuition and ideas on how to start as an affiliate as well as marketing help such as ppc, seo, website building and content creation. <br>  <br>  As for a really good affiliate program to join for average people, and believe me i consider myself very average, i  totally recommend this, <a href="http://www.leadsleap.com/go/18852" rel="nofollow">http://www.leadsleap.com/go/18852</a>  This has to be one of the easiest ways to start earning decent commissions as an affiliate in my opinion. Again, totally free to join. There is an upgrade but you are never under pressure to upgrade and to tell you the truth would only need or want  to once you are making good profits. Tons of video tutorials so you can literally watch, pause, implement and continue watching. Very easy. Plus they have a lot of good quality products to sell, but best of all you can build your own list of subscribers with this program, and anybody who has been looking to earn a living on line has heard saying 'the money is in the list'. So true.<br>  <br>  The thing to remember above all is firstly decide on your niche(s) and find quality products you like or are interested in, then stick to them and give it a real go  i.e. promote the hell out of them. <br>  <br>  Good luck in finding your products.|`|6lIzPAgkaa	amazon.com is good.<br>  I have something notes about affiliate marketing on my blog, this is the address:<br>  <a href="http://shj22673.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://shj22673.wordpress.com/</a><br>  <br>  -smn-|`|x4YQZbzwaa	www.FlexOffers.com is supposed to be good.

413b409fd96101be076b46f8aee41bf0aa	The best advice I can give you is simply practice. If you want to be an animator at Pixar, you'll need to know the right software. Many of Pixar's top directors attended CalArts and its Character Animation program, so that might be an option. The best thing you can do is start now. Invest some money in the latest animation software and making sure your computer is able to handle it (memory, hard drive space, etc.), then practice in your spare time. The same goes with being a writer. One suggestion would be to write a short screenplay and then make an animated film out of it, then submit it to Pixar.<br>  <br>  I should advise you not to expect them to accept you on your first application (although they might). I've applied to Pixar twice for artist positions and was rejected both times, but plan to keep trying because I want to work at Pixar as well. So even if you're rejected, keep practicing and resubmitting. Perseverance pays off.<br>  <br>  As for A-levels, I'm afraid I don't know much about that. However, I found a website that I hope helps you out. Best of luck to you. :)|`|BE2F8LjTaa	I work in a preofessional 3D environmet and I have to say there a few things you need:<br>  <br>  1.

4f3GfrN6aa	Yes it is.  I work for minimum wage in Australia (which is $15 an hour before tax, but after tax works out to about $11 an hour -- plus our dollar is worth about nothing compared to yours, so we'd be about the same).<br>  <br>  I work 2 jobs, a full time and a casual after hours job.

Park centrally and walk to where you need to go.  That'll save fuel.<br>  <br>  See if the university has the course textbook on short term 2 hour loan at the library.  That way, you can sneak into the library, read the textbook and take notes for 2 hours, and not have to fork out for the book.<br>  <br>  Try to save at least 10% of your income.  Either set up a special savings account and have your employer transfer money into it each week, or deposit the money into that savings account yourself.<br>  <br>  I worked 2 jobs when I was at University, and I managed to save.  Some of those savings became my house deposit.  <br>  <br>  You might need to get another job or tutor or sell some stuff that you own if you really want to save up some money.  I suggest aiming for a couple of thousand dollars, and then investing it in a mutual or managed fund.

4e793a9ecf65894a0976b8757aeec5b2aa	Citigroup is deemed to be too-big-to-fail bank. I will hold until the dilution of common shares. And then buy several thousands at bargain prices.|`|P4gEmKaGaa	Why are you even contemplating buying Citi Stock?<br>  <br>  The only people who should buy Citigroup stock at this point are the people who know how to day trade. There is no value in this company. Investing in this company is like betting on a quardaplegic pony in a horse race!<br>  <br>  If your going to invest in a bank or financial, my advice is to invest in Morgan Stanley (MS) or visa (V). I own both companies, they pay small but stable dividends and both have great upside potential. Visa is a bargain at it's current price even with the move up its seen lately. The company offered its IPO at the very start of the credit crisis and the stock has not been afforded the opportunity to make a run up the way Mastercard did after it's IPO and Visa is a better company! (Better in that it is more globally diversified and is larger based on the number of credit and debit cards it has issued). Morgan Stanley has been hit hard along with every bank but Morgan Stanley is a strong, viable company that will not dissipate in a few years the way companies such as Citi will. If you don't like MS look at Wells Fargo or Northern Trust. Bot h are also responsible lending companies.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	I'm a bad investor, but I'd sell.|`|ojHN65J0aa	I know one very foolish person who bought the stock a few days ago and has already lost 36% of his investment.<br>  <br>  Course it could go up but.........|`|dC6A5R5Saa	If you own them, hold.  If you're considering buying, wait for things to pick up.  <br>  <br>  Selling shares in a bank at 1.50 doesn't seem like a good idea.  The government recently buying a stake has raised much needed capital for Citi despite diluting the share price.

If they hear any kind of drama from you, you will not get the job, no matter whose fault it was.<br>  <br>  They will definitely ask you about the gap in your employment history.  You can say that you had family responsibilities or that you were pursuing your education.  Don't give any more details - just say you're excited to be entering the workforce again and that you know you'll bring new energy to the company.<br>  <br>  Nobody wants to go to work, but games have rules.|`|VrR9ojRRaa	What you have to do is weigh up what the interviewer wants to hear and add that into what you have done in your job history and what you do know. <br>  Like if your going to work with food, try and talk about things you know are good to talk about or throw in words you know people that work with food know. Make them think you know exactly what they are talking about so they see potential in you, but never lie.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming you haven't worked in 5 years because of children? But even so, be honest in the interview, but only say as much as you need to. Try and start with common ground, see if you can find out what he likes and work around that, so if it does get awkward or a funny, you can always go into something that you know he likes. <br>  <br>  Other than that, be as natural as possible.

Firstly it seems you are talking about your US tax return, not your Australian tax return which you are not yet required to lodge until after June 2009 (our financial year for tax purposes runs from July 1 to June 30). Australian Tax Agents may or may not be able to help you lodge your US tax return, its a rare occurence that we are asked to do so. Your best option would be to contact your consulate who should be able to point you in the right direction (you can also lodge your US taxes with them). Having been in Australia for so long it is likely that you are now a resident of Australia for taxation purposes, therefore on your Australian tax return you will need to declare your worldwide income, not just that earned here in Oz. This means you could be subject to being double taxed on your earnings. There are however double tax treaties between our two countries to prevent this happening, the trouble will be with working out what income belongs on what tax return. You are probably best talking to one of the big accounting firms about this as they are adept in international tax issues, someone like Price Waterhouse for instance. They have a worldwide presence and should be able to help you out. Your first port of call though should be to your consulate.|`|hCqoJ4nTaa	I was told at my school that the IRS has the forms online at <a href="http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/</a>  you can complete them yourself.

Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. <br>  <br>  Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs <br>  <br>  The government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money.

Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.<br>  <br>  For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant.

When you deposit money again, they will take what you owe them in addition to the late charge.|`|DCixOqsnaa	You should have gotten paperwork on how the payment structure would work if you were short funds in your account. This is very simple, if your credit union is open, call them right away and ask them.  If your payments were scheduled to be paid from your account prior to the loan due date, its not likely they will charge you anything.  Get this done quickly so they dont charge any extra fees that might be attached.  If this is just the first time, you might be able to call them and ask them if they will reverse any fees because its your first time and it was a simple mistake. Good luck.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S., Canada and Europe which you can create to generate income:<br>  <br>  1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4ndUXgUCaa	i got a job a month ago at cousins...or "subway" if your not from wisconsin.
DuA8vkJHaa	It depends on a number of factors. If the country has an agreement with the US is open to FDI money and if you are willing to relocate or not. best case scenario the country has a trade relationship with the US, is open to foreign direct investment has no rules on equity and on foreigners owning business and are ok with an offshore owner. Then yes you can invest there and start a business. <br>  <br>  Now some countries do have investment guidelines especially for FDI, in which they would specify the minimum investment required, fix the equity that you can own and specify if you need to be physically present. This may or may not be to your liking. <br>  <br>  Having said that there are ways and means to do business abroad, laws are not perfect and have loopholes. You would need to consult with a lawyer with your specific country in mind. <br>  <br>  Partnerships: this is a great way of entering into a new market, especially since you might not know everything about the market that you are entering. Now if you do decide to go in for a partnership its is not necessary to convert your company into a corporation, you could opt for a limited partnership or full fledged partnership and still keep the money private. Bear in mind that sole proprietorship and partnerships do have liability risks and you would need to take steps for that. Corporations can have limited liabilities. (LLC).  Now each country has its own rules on partnerships which are usually linked to FDI policy. Its hard to give you specific advice as I dont know the country that you are looking at. But bear in mind to clearly define the value proposition to your partners before hand. e.e what can you bring to the table that is valuable to the prospective partner. <br>  <br>  Finally if you are a US citizen your income would be taxed from all sources across the world. Take steps to avoid double taxation. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Technically, it will depend on the country from where you operate.

Otherwise every executor would just spend all the money and say "Let the interest accumulate".<br>  If there is not enuf money for all creditors, keep a record of how you apportioned the money..|`|tdQTZPI7aa	As the executor you will be sued for failure to use the assets of the estate to pay the bills.|`|8y6PsWNdaa	It's up to the executor of the will to pay the debts, and then pay out to the beneficiaries.  It sounds like maybe he didn't leave a will, and you are stuck cleaning up.  The first thing you need to do is to go to the courthouse and get yourself appointed as his executor.  Then you have the right to sell the house, pay the debts, and pass out any money left over as the court says you need to.  It is usually divided between the spouse and children.  Check with your local courthouse, and they will be able to help walk you through it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

3mAgM405aa	The opportunities for a paralegal really depends on the specialty. The most in demand paralegals are those in the litigation field; followed by corporate paralegals who are responsible for maintaining corporate records, articles of incorporation, etc. While the "least" marketable [but the "highest" paid] paralegals are in the field of intellectual property [i.e., patents, trademarks] and immigration law. In conclusion, choose your paralegal courses accordingly, with emphasis on litigation preparation [discovery], docketing/calendaring of incoming pleadings [calendaring] and trial preparation [creating Exhibit tabs, Bajii jury instructions, etc.]. The "pro" side of a litigation paralegal is often "unlimited" overtime which can amount to a high salary range of $65,000 to $75,000 per year, while the "downside," being constantly pressured to meet a monthly client billable quota. And failing to meet that quota, often results in the paralegal's overnight dismissal. It's not a pretty picture. I just want to lay out what really happens in the real world of litigators and their relationship with subordinate paralegals.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OU9xnW86aa	One only takes "Paralegal Studies" if they want to be a paralegal.

Did you just leave the house vacant?|`|91XVWCWWaa	Did you receive a notice of foreclosure with a date that the property will be sold on?  If so, it's too late to do much but you should have had prior notice before this.  I believe you might have known about being behind and could of called your lender to make other arrangements.  It does not matter if you live there or not but if there are tenants they will have to be completely out the day before the sale or get charged with trespassing.

We charge a $3 fee and your credit card company will likely charge a higher interest rate, but if you can pay it off Friday when you get your check, you won't have to pay any interest.|`|1d82076c63425fc7ea90d65c2c51804baa	Some credit card companies will send their customers check they can write and it goes directly on the card?

You need to know everything there is to know about the products. You need to be very outgoing, a knowledge of many things to small talk about, have an ability to not take no for an answer, an ability to look at another person, and instantly know what color makeup she would look best in, be an artist of sorts, be aggressive, be prepared to spend out of pocket money on coffee, desserts, candy to have on hand near your potential clients, to keep them satisfied.<br>  It will not be easy especially the first year or so. But if you persist, and give it your best shot, you might succeed. <br>  Be extremely prepared and organized about everything if you do decide to do this. Research it online ahead. Ask questions and do not fall for the "I just made a million bucks this year, and you can too" gimmick. Rememebr a lot more people will fail at selling than succeed, but you won't hear about them. Good luck|`|ot1ZZexeaa	I found my avon lady through the grocery store.

You might want to start by volunteering with an organization you might want to work for at some point in time. If it's animals, look for a shelter or rescue group. If its with people, it depends on what kind of people. In my area, there is a group that works with handicapped kids and horses.  See if there is a Volunteer Center in your community that can get you information about what's available. You usually only need a High School diploma or GED, and a clean criminal background.|`|RKXDlfW8aa	well while there is certainly nothing wrong of being a janitor many have and still does so to put food on their tables,roof over the families head and beds to sleep in and bills to pay ..<br>  <br>  Animals are SO wonderful and certainly a true gift from God!<br>  as a far as volunteering for an animal instuition you need to call each of them and ask them.<br>  <br>  Nah! as a animal rescuer vol I'm not aware of needing a higher education !<br>  <br>  Go for it ,it is SO rewarding!!<br>  <br>  you must have patience,love kindness,and time to give !<br>  talk to your local "Angels Of Assisi Clinic and or humane shelter  nearest you!<br>  <br>  God luck&God bless

Some people WILL take that the wrong way. I assume that you do costumes for children's parties, or are a clown. <br>  <br>  What I would say is something catchy that would attract people to the service that you are offering. You have to find a way to stand out among consumers.<br>  <br>  Try something like:<br>  <br>  A Dress For Every Occasion<br>  <br>  if you do multiple costumes.<br>  <br>  If not, try:<br>  <br>  It will be fun<br>  <br>  <br>  Simplistic, gets the message across, and lets people know the intent of your service. <br>  <br>  While my ideas may not be the best, they will help you make a starting point, should you not like the suggestions.

But if <br>  <br>  you dont go there much , this is another way <br>  <br>  of buying ........."Day Pass".   You better ask <br>  <br>  if they do have a day pass , I know Sams does.<br>  <br>  I don't buy stuff there much , why , because these <br>  <br>  stores raised there prices up , it's cheaper to buy <br>  <br>  it at Walmart .|`|H1vfrIg0aa	in the store the name on your costco card has to match the name on your credit/debit card.  if you bring guests into the store, they have to pay with cash under your card.

ibeFIUpkaa	You don't need a license to buy wholesale, That I know of But I live in Oregon.  but you do need a business license.<br>  <br>  And you really need to state "WHAT" you want to sell?<br>  <br>  If Electronics you can be a partner with Ingram Micro DandH and others, also you can get dirrect contact with Vendors and become a Value added Reseller.<br>  <br>  But you really need to decide WHAT you want to sell before I can answer WHERE to buy stuff? <br>  <br>  Some Manufacturing places allow Drop Ship etc, and some require minimum orders to become a vendor.<br>  <br>  (Example: Nike Sells Shoes to Footlocker with custom design, however they require Minimum of 1,000 shoes)<br>  <br>  Depending on if you want to DROP Ship or inventory the items yourself will also depend on how much money you make and how much you have to spend. <br>  <br>  First write up a Business Plan, decide what you want to sell and how you are going to track inventory, collect money and pay taxes.  If Drop Ship then you can avoid some large costs. (However you won't get as great as discount.)<br>  <br>  Next you need a website with a shopping cart and inventory tracking. <br>  (I suggest paying for one until you get enough capital to build run your own server/website.)<br>  <br>  You will need to Get a Business License from the State (CA as in California?) If Canada I don't have a clue.<br>  <br>  And in California you will need a City license and a TAX ID.<br>  <br>  A good Idea to conact an Accountant.<br>  <br>  Because you also need to collect taxes on all products you sell to people in California. (vs outside the state)<br>  <br>  But first you need to decide on WHAT you want to sell.<br>  I recommend you find a "NITCH" other than trying to sell things that you can buy at WalMart.

1f34cb08ac2251c3afe6fe04a9dfbc46aa	An "analyst" is usually a post MBA job title in the ER world.  They can make maybe 100k salary, with bonus being 40-75% of total comp in a normal year.<br>  <br>  An "associate" is the pre-MBA equivalent.  They make ~60k salary, with closer to 50/50 mix on total comp, unless you land something big, or screw up something important.<br>  <br>  Just be aware that ER jobs demand 80-120 hrs, depending on the season.

I've been making good money, working from home on the internet for years, mainly doing e-commerce websites, selling products, but it is hard work, and I’ve gotten burned out.  So recently, I was looking to find another way to make money doing certain types of internet marketing that are very popular, but that I had little experience with.<br>   <br>  A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon an amazing online Money Making club that is FANTASTIC. It has a HUGE amount of online video tutorials that show you, step by step, Exactly how to make very good money doing internet marketing without the need for a product, service, or website.  It’s not multi-level marketing.  It’s not about sales.  In fact, you don’t even have to talk to anyone to make really good money.<br>  <br>  When I first saw the web page that promotes this money-making club, I was so impressed with the honest presentation, I joined the club right away (it's Cheap).  I still did my research to make sure it wasn't a scam, and it is definitely NOT a scam.  It’s the Real Thing.  I'm positive of it.  And I’ve already proven it to myself and others I know.<br>  <br>  So, last week, I just started watching a couple of the online video tutorials and putting them into practice, and in my first two days, I made $200. And I've barely scratched the surface of all that amazing video material that is offered. This is just the beginning.  I’m extremely excited about this.<br>  <br>  Oh, by the way, you get on-going Free email support from real people who care about your success. <br>  <br>  So, take a look at these short Free online videos that show you Exactly how to make great money, working from home (or anywhere) doing internet marketing that Really Works - even if you're a rank beginner.

Most of the work you do will be dependent upon what work is available. Jobs such as ChaCha, can be a lot of fun, but again--limited in the amount of money you can earn.<br>  <br>  A business can possibly have better income, but it all depends on you. The amount of income you earn will be dependent on you and not what work is available. Most of the companies will have a fee to pay for the starter kit. The cost can range. Some companies require inventory, so the starter kit is higher. I joined Scentsy and am having a great time with them. The starter kit for them was only $99.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is to follow your passion. If you're doing something you love, then it is definitely worth it.

It has always been my experience that when a location is taken over, unless there is specifics noted in the sale, all contracts, and debts are honored by the new company. However, since you are now working for a new company, they are allowed to make any changes they see fit, including pay scales, bonuses,and operational changes to benefit the company as needed. During the takeover period, they can call as many emergency meetings as need to bring the staff up to new standards as quickly as possible.|`|p2NnwRj4aa	how did you get to write such a long question,im only allowed 86 characters|`|jmcktdo9aa	If your employer requires you to attend a lecture, meeting or training session according to labor law you must be paid for that time if you are under your employers control or for your employers benefit even if you are not performing your regular duties.

L04hnvD3aa	I had the same feeling as you did. You take the classes they are about 2-4 days. Half is in the class half is in the pool. In the class you will learn cpr, aed, oxygen, first aid. That part is very easy you just have to pay attention. Then the swimming part, You get a brick on the bottom and swim a certain distance with it on your chest. Also they will teach you different jumps to get in the water, different saving techniques, what to do if someone is drowning you. It was all very easy for me and im 115 pounds. It is very tiring so sleep is good. Study study, because you ll be given a written test on the info. It was definitely worth it to take the classes. When you get a job its simple. You get paid to pretty much sit on a chair all day. Its fun, you meet lots of people. As far as that goes your getting yourself into something good. Its fun. hope i helped :)|`|AA10916288	In order to pass the lifeguard training course you need to be a strong swimmer. Not swim team strong, just a good swimmer. You will probably have to swim 300-500 yards (standard pool length is 25 or 50 yards) using a combination of freestyle (front crawl), and breaststroke non-stop in order to qualify to take the course. You will also need to be able to retrieve a 10 pound brick from the bottom of the pool (deep end) and tread water with the brick above your head (and your head above water) and/or swim 20-25 yards with the brick out of the water.<br>  <br>  That's just the pre-course test. If you can do all that, they will let you take the course.<br>  <br>  The pre-test is probably the hardest part. After that there is a lot of video watching and practicing rescues, CPR, and first aid. You will have many chances to practice before your final test. If you do well in training, pay attention to the movies, and study the books, you should have no problems passing either the written and practical tests (CPR, first aid, and lifeguard).<br>  <br>  My advice to you is if you are not sure if you are a strong enough swimmer, you should go to the pool when you have free time and practice swimming. If you can't make it the whole 500 yards (10 laps/20 lengths in a 25 yard pool), then keep going to the pool to build up endurance and perfect your strokes. You can also ask the lifeguard if there is a brick you can practice with. If the guard is nice, they may even give you some more tips and tricks.

Try posting your resume on as many career sites like Monster, Career Builder, Yahoo Hotjobs and list what type of position you are looking for; there are a lot of employers on these sites and some will call or e-mail you if they are interested in setting up an interview with you. Try also searching management trainee positions on Google. Hope this helps with your job search!

But in general, a spelling test could be a good one. I've known of companies who use a jargon test. In other words, a listing of various buzzwords that are used in the field. That way, you can tell if someone really knows the business.<br>  <br>  I've been through interviews in the past where gave me a series of math and filing tests. They had time limits to put some added pressure on applicants. And you were not allowed to use calculators or computers on the math test.<br>  <br>  I've also been put through "office tests" on the computer. For example, one asked me to setup a mail-merge. Another asked me to revise a letter the boss was sending to a customer. These were good tests of one's actual ability to handle a variety of real world situations.<br>  <br>  With receptionist positions, I've run into companies that will have the person sit behind the desk while specific people in the office call. This was a great test to see how the applicant might handle himself or herself in the job. And you were able to evaluate their phone manner and professionalism.<br>  <br>  I hope these will help you out.|`|DF22BQ3yaa	Analyze your daily job duties and how it is they can be better.

Answers: <br>  Delegate...Assign <br>  Coarse...Obscene; vulgar  <br>  Tension...Straining<br>  <br>  Something like this will let you know they have knowledge of what words mean, how to use them and would know how to speak for themselves should they ever professionally encounter conversation with someone at the firm.

It is free to sign up, you never have to buy anything, pretty easy to use, and they send you a check on the 15th of every month.<br>  Also I receive the equivalence 20% of your earnings (don't worry, it does NOT come out of your earnings)... and that means that if you sign up and refer a friend, you will make 20% of what they earn as well!!!<br>  So it is basically a sweet system, if you are need of cash (and lets face it, who doesn't want more money?) then you should try this, there is nothing to lose, only money to gain<br>  <br>  Once again, you don't need a credit card or anything to sign up, and once you get the hang of it you can make loads of cash doing virtually nothing. Offers payouts vary from about .50-1.50, but there are some above that. you can use a online giftcard or prepaid giftcard to do the higher paying offers. buy them at walgreens/cvs. for those you will pay a few dollars for shipping and handling on a product, but get paid $12-18 to try it. nice profit<br>  <br>  Below I will give you STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SIGN UP for SC.com and do the super quick 50 cent offers (I'm to the point where they take me about 30 seconds to complete)<br>  <br>  1) Make sure you have an email you use just for junk mail (gmail or hotmail or whatever is fine! Just don't use an email that you don't want to get spammed).<br>  <br>  2) Sign up using that email and other info for real at:<br>  <a href="http://www.swatcash.com/2260" rel="nofollow">http://www.swatcash.com/2260</a><br>  (sc.com uses your address only to send the check. I have been a member for a few months and haven't got anything unwanted in my mailbox)<br>  <br>  3) Once you are logged in, click on cash offers on the left.<br>  <br>  4) I recommend clicking on the ($.50) links that say "enter email address or zip code with intent to participate".<br>  <br>  5) This will take you to a new web page, where you enter your (spam =D) email address and hit "submit" and the next page asks you to enter your address and stuff (which you can BS). After you submit this page, you can exit. You do not have to answer the yes/no questions that follow.<br>  <br>  6) You will then be back at SwatCash. Click "complete" for the offer you just did, and the transaction will be processed. Once the transaction is verified, you will receive the amount of money indicated. People say that if you rotate multiple (spam) email accounts you'll get more offers approved...<br>  <br>  RECOMMENDED: Is to make a gmail account because there is a neat little trick you can do. Say your email address is Bill123@gmail.com you can place a (.) anywhere in the address and it still goes to the same place, so this eliminates having to make 5 seperate email accounts. Example: Bill.123@gmail.com or Bi.ll123@gmail.com ect. If you would like an invite to gmail just ask me and I can send you one.<br>  <br>  Any questions about how this works or how to sign up, contact me. I can explain it all.

AA10464818	The government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. There are no grants for paying bills, for getting out of debt or for buying a car. Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.<br>  <br>  For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant.<br>  <br>  There is a stringent review process through a committee. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.<br>  <br>  Nonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) <a href="http://www.cfda.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfda.gov</a> and Grants.gov <a href="http://www.grants.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.grants.gov</a> - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants.

Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. <br>  <br>  Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	To get GRANT you have to have an organization that is a 501 C3 - non -profit corporation.<br>  <br>  Once you have organized a public benefit corp then you apply for grants or a hire a grant writer on comp (they write your grant without up front fees and get a portion of your funds if you get a grant).<br>  <br>  You don't have to pay for INFO-  there are lots or resources out there.
1TrRrWMLaa	Well of course banks are the best way but, most require a minimum amount for a savings account, like $500. If you want to try and save some money that you  have left over, but don't have a lot try this. Every time you get a dollar put it up, just don't spend it. You can spend 5's 10's 20's, just no ones. That all the ones you have at the end of each day and put them in a safe place. At the end of a month count up how much you have saved. You will be surprised. I tried this and I saved about $50 a month. I mean if you go out and need to leave a couple dollars for a tip that's OK, but otherwise don't spend it. Everything these days is more than a dollar, from coffee to a candy bar, to that 99 cents hamburger that is like 1.06 after tax.

ot1ZZexeaa	Hiring managers deliberate extensively about their decisions and they feel more comfortable with a candidate who has a connection. Part of it because it eases some of their fears and also because there is an added expectation that the referring party wouldn't refer a candidate would end up being a hiring disaster. <br>  <br>  In short it gives the hiring person plausible deniability.

SydDWfJzaa	Getting out of stocks at this time is not rational. Unless you have to spend/use the cash for emergency. So ride out the crisis. If you have cash to invest, depends on your horizon. If it's bit long more than 5 years then stocks would be better option - I personally suggest ETF. If it is shorter try CD's. They are guaranteed by FDIC upto 250K until end of 2009 and 100 K thereafter. I suggest bonds only if you plan  to hold until maturity. If interest rates rise, you may end up losing money if you decide to sell the bond (corporate or treasury) before it matures. Since interest rate and price of bond negatively correlated.

I was scammed more than once on Ebay and will not ever use it again.|`|HA9lghPqaa	?|`|TP0Hh73qaa	Yes, you sure can.<br>                     HOPE THIS HELPED|`|6OyPLwH2aa	yea....i dont know how though>>!|`|n46fsdNZaa	yeah you can just call one of the contact numbers and they will do it for you|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Yes, you sure can.|`|AA10481071	yup, you sure can
PxoKseAiaa	I believe what this is is a card which is tied to your PayPal account and it is only used once.  That way it avoids fraud.  They generate a number that is only used one time to pay for a service.<br>  <br>  Download the PayPal tool bar and it will be on there.<br>  <br>  Go to PayPal and read for more info.
4xN3ZIhYaa	before you walk into a bank, get a full credit report from all three credit reporting agencies.  (experion,transunion,equifax) so you know where you stand and what it says.<br>  <br>  try a few banks to see how they compare, try a credit union i swear by them. u may have to open a account.<br>  <br>  they like it when u say its for debt consolidation, they will want to know your anual salary and monthly rent.<br>  <br>  30,000 might be a bit large, consider just chopping up your credit cards and doing it yourself, or try to do a smaller loan and pay it off ask for another one since you have proven yourself.|`|oiRYLv1jaa	Times are gonna get worse!! Try to sell your car and downsize to a 10 yr old Civic for 2 yrs. You should be able to clear about 10-15k and put that against your highest rate bills. <br>  <br>  Then let the dust settle for 2 months and go for a bank loan or a balance transfer surfing! <br>  <br>  If you're thinking "why should i sell my car?" and it's not a necessity to drive *that* car, then you do not have the will to keep your finances afloat long term. <br>  <br>  Its your decision - and your opportunity to prove that you can survive!
OCVFrgeXaa	If she puts a charge on the property, it doesn't really matter if she's on the mortgage or not because she'll get her share of the equity whenever the property is refinanced or sold.<br>  <br>  I'm sure the ex does want to keep her on the mortgage, because if he defaults on it, she is liable for the full mortgage payments.<br>  <br>  Assuming you are in the UK, it is possible to for your girlfriend to be removed from the mortgage.  This entails a 'transfer of equity' - don't read anything into the name, it's just the lenders terminology for transferring the property into the ex's sole name, and therefore the mortgage.  The charge would still mean she retains the equity share.<br>  <br>  While your girlfriend is party to the mortgage, she may find it difficult to get a mortgage in her own name because a prospective lender will be conscious that she is legally responsible for this mortgage, and will want to ensure that she can pay both, should it come down to it.<br>  <br>  However, if as you say, the ex can't afford to buy-out your girlfriend, it's unlikely that a lender will be willing to transfer the mortgage to his sole name.|`|HP1pToMOaa	That does not make sense. A charge of what? If the mortgage is in joint names they both have to pay it. If he stops paying his half she will have to pay the full amount. She cannot take her name off the mortgage.
OOsmPPYbaa	Since you've already gained employment, here's my advice.  Never leave a place until you've got something else lined up, and then make sure to leave on good terms.  The economy sucks right now, and you should feel very fortunate to have a job, like you said, it would probably be months again before you find something else, and how do you think they would react if you told them you already had a job, but left it because your parents thought it was a bad idea.<br>  <br>  Stick with it until you find something better, and then move on, but don't burn your bridges! You could need a job later, and this could be the reference that gets it for you.  Not only that, but you may need to go back to this place if things don't work out elsewhere.
AA11639059	LOL, I take it you haven't been following stem cell research. There is an interesting phenomenon that sends many researchers to non-embryonic stem cells. Something in the embryonics tend to cause a large number of tumors. There are stem cell products on the market and doing well in tests right now that use stem cells harvested or accessed in place from skin cells, fat cells, and bone marrow cells, among a few others. The problem investing in them is that some of the processes are unpatentable (as in occuring naturally). Some of the big Pharma had been burned by both public pressure and poor results while using the available embryonic cell pools, so they want the little guys to fight the battles and let them buy the successes out later. Right now most of the good stuff is owned by hospital and university research labs. These want their share of scientific glory before accepting bids for the rights. Proving something to the scientific community is one thing, but to run the tests that agencies like the US FDA are an entirely different hurdle. <br>  <br>  Don't hold your breath.|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	Penny stocks is NOT a wise investment. Its kinda like slots, you can widdle your money away quick.|`|17RmbitOaa	STEM (symbol)   You asked a couple of days too late, but it could still go to six.  Look at the chart.  Each time it went to six, they were talking about a new bill being passed.
fPOg9DuXaa	Maybe you'd like to be a teacher? I am a third grade teacher and it is very fulfilling. To be a teacher you must be organized, able to stick to a schedule, a good listener, able to do arts and crafts, desire to help people, generous, thoughful and patient and calm. Also, taking a student who doesn't know how to read and figuring out the problem and figuring out how to help that student is a lot like 'fixing things!' I teach primary grades, but based on your like for science, maybe you want to be a high school or middle school science teacher. :) Good luck!!!
