20070121182858AAgXWST	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should I ask him to Sadies?	I used to like this guy...and I'm not really sure what my feelings are for him right now. I was told that he DID like me but hesitated to ask me to formal last month because he was scared that I wouldn't talk. I'm not really sure what to do, my best friend knows the both of us and she says that I should, and his friend says so too. But I don't want to ask him because i'm not sure of my feelings and i'm not sure of his feelings either. I have today to figure this out, because if i'm going to ask him, I have to do it tomorrow.  We don't talk with each other very much but there have been hints that I should ask him, so I decided that i'm going to.      How should I ask him?  We have a weight training class together during school and I don't want it to be more awkward than it already is between us.  I also kind of want to let him know that I know we don't talk very much and he's hesitant because of that but I still want to try it out.

My EX Best Friend (Jeanette) is seeking revenge on me ever since my other friend (Madison) said that she said that I didn't want to be Jeanette's friend anymore. We were the best of friends. WERE      "You know when I hit the ball at you during dodgeball? That was only one scoop of revenge." Jeanette      She also said that she would never ever ever ever be my friend again. I make her suffocate when I'm around her. She hates me to h*ll (I sit right behind her)      Also, Madison will think I'm Jeanette's friend whenever I talk to her and she'll get all mad. NOT GOOD! I hate it when she ignores me.      I know that people like her aren't worth it, but I can't stop thinking of what kind of revenge Jeanette is brewing! (She's really strong!!!)

I brought up all the negative things she has said to me and my husband. I even told her that her Mexican family members had been racist against me. Her response was GIRL THIS IS COMING FROM FAMILY YOU NEED COUNSELING. Thats all she keeps telling me is that I need counseling. Should I just have ignored it all?

I will be seeing my boyfriend Wednesday, and I havent seen him for awhile because he lives about an hour from me and he works all the time so I can only see him when he isnt working. Well my friend told me that she would be coming to my house all week until her boyfriend gets off work. The thing is I want to be able to spend time alone with my boyfriend. I just dont know how to tell my friend that. I dont really want my friend to be here when he is because she will ask him all kinds of stuff and I dont want her saying things about me that I dont know she says. (I wont know because Im deaf and she talks about me sometimes, my cousin said she does and the other night she called me a b*tch because I was in a bad mood and she was here but I was upset and she made it worse and she knew I was upset.) I just dont want her saying things to my boyfriend and then having him get mad at me for something she says. I dont like to be mean but I wanna be with him for one day alone. How can I break it?

20070418072620AAYHJib	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I contact my ex and if yes, how to go about it?	I am torn as to what to do about my ex girlfriend. Our relationship ended suddenly 3 mths ago, her choice, as she said her feelings had changed      She had loads of other stuff on at the time, family problems, work stress, was depressed etc. In the 2 week period when we talkied about breaking up she admitted to me that she wanted to be with me but that she "would drag me down" & got "cold hearted". Despite me being there for her with her problems, she still ended things.      I have decided to move on. I have been out on various dates with other people, had fun with friends etc. She went out with someone else for dates, that has now ended.      I was debating or not whether to call her & suggest a meet up. I tried loads to persuade her us being apart was wrong, but that if it was what she wanted, then that was best as I wanted her to be happy. I worry she made a fundamental decision at a time when other stuff was going on      I want to see if the spark is still there & go from there???

I had this guy after me from past three years. that time i was dating another guy when he initially proposed me but we always remained good friends. year ago i was single again and this guy had moved out of state but recently started communicating thru phones. and in few mnths i fell in love with him. he was always askin me to marry him so one day i went and told my parents about him. they asked for his biodata and when i asked the guy he said that his parents are giving second thoughts so he will have to go to home(currently in another country) and first handle them and then once he comes back  he will answer me. so i m confused here bc he was the one who asked me for marriage but then he only dejected me. he also said many factors came into play in making this decision that is me being reproductively challenged, our age difference of 7 years . so should i marry him if he comes back or not? or does he still love me or not? so confused

20070604120936AAqzAjT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's his problem, could he like me?	this guy is beyond rude, he has his good days, but lately i have been his victim, he makes fun of me becuase he thinks i am retarded and he says i never buss off his tables and that's not true, he is soo full of himself, he made me cry and i had enough, he also makes sexual harassment jokes and so i went to my manager after being tired of taking his abuse, he found it funny and even thought he apologized , however he wasn't sincere so i didn't even want to hear sorry, i just want him to ignore me, he doesn't , after i tattled on him and he decided to talk to me in a very nice way..really why can't this guy get through his head i want him to ingore me ? why doesn't he? there was no reason for him to talk to me..   he just ended his engagement becuase his fiancee suspected him of cheating with a coworker, she's the same age iam and our birthdays are around the same time, maybe i resemble her in some way and that's why he buggs me,
20080403093404AAYHJ7i	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Meet, know and fall in love and then..it's over and now what...?	Some say true love knocks only once and if unanswered it's lost forever.   It did come with a bang when we were younger with all the flutters. Now settled with "the love of my life" we find I've a condition preventing us to go the family way and he drifts away physically and emotionally very very far way..Wish there were more bridges we could have walked together but guess sometimes love just isn't enough to bridge the distance between two loving hearts when other things seem more important..   I'm happy I answered the call for true love once, coz afterall it's better to have loved and lost than to have not loved at all.    you can be kind to offer prayers for us or drop a word of kindness I feel that would help me in some way. If you've been where I'm today let me know how you worked it thru'...

He's a friend of a friend of a friend kind of?  We write actual snail mail letters.  This has been going on since last Dec.  We sent each other pictures right off.  We aren't exactly flirty in our letters.  His last one to me was 9 full pages, single spaced, tiny font.  We just talk about everything and anything.  He calls me his friend (does that mean that's all he wants?)  He's going home the 31st of August, and we can't meet before this.  He lives in CA and I live in Utah, so I don't know how we'd meet and we haven't discussed it.  I want to meet him really bad, but I have no idea what he thinks of me.  I'm unfamiliar with things like this.  I can usually tell if a guy is interested, and I just let him know that I am, too.  What if I'm not interested in him after we meet, and I've told him I am on paper? (I haven't) Or Visa Versa?  Help!!!!!!!!!!!!  Please!!!!!!!! It's driving me nuts!!!!!  Thanks so much!

He treats her and other women like objects.  What should I do?  She is an amazing and beautiful person.

20070526230602AA7ruo9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Old or new?	I have a long time Gf I have had for >3 yrs and she has nothing in common with me any more. She hates everything I like. Thinks everything I want to talk about is stupid and just wants me to lie down in bed watching TV all day with her. We argue a lot and she hurts my feelings often with her negative attitude. Here is the catch though, she has given me thousands of dollars (to pay debt) and basically put a roof over my head. She also quit college to work and thinks I am her investment. I feel obligated to her if I left I would seem to have used her and it would devastate her. Also she has only given sexual relations 1 time in the past yr.   My problem is I have a friend whom Ive known longer than her has been showing an interest in me and has made it very obvious she wants to be with me and I would like to be with her too.   would like to patch it up with my gf since I owe her so much but Im jus not attracted to her like she is to me now. What should I do stay with old or new

Well you see I've been dating this girl for a few days now, she's a cool girl and I like her =]  (obviously) only downside is she has NEVER made out with a guy before.  Well I enjoy making out, infact kissing is nothing unless there is some tongue and making out action involved (mostly what I believe) she has kissed a guy before but like I said before never actually made out.  How do I go about making out with her?  Do I just wait for the right moment, go in for the kiss and slip in the tongue?  haha this may seem like a dumb question, but I don't wanna mess things up. =]

20070621020512AAe6fuq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Words that women use...?	FINE      This is the word women use to end an argument when they are right and you need to shut up.         FIVE MINUTES         If she is getting dressed, this is half an hour. Five minutes is only five minutes if you have just been given 5 more minutes to watch the game before helping around the house.            NOTHING      This is the calm before the storm. This means "something," and you should be on your toes.  Arguments that begin with 'Nothing' usually end in "Fine"          GO AHEAD         This is a dare, not permission. Don't do it.            LOUD SIGH         This is not actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are an idiot and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over "Nothing"                           THAT'S OKAY         This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can make to a man. "That's Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard before deciding how and when you

What physical features are most appealing to men now of women, (granted these things vary with each individual person)? Should a woman be smart or do you feel handicaped by a mate who is more inteligent than yourself?

20080211150128AAwAC4j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he acting like this?	Awhile back, my bff mentioned to the guy I liked that I liked him. His response was weird: So I should be on the lookout? I gave up. He did show some signs of interest in me after that but I assumed he was just being friendly since we were friends just not close friends. He did randomly touch me on the shoulders twice. Ive never seen him do that to other girls.  One night we got a bit tipsy (not sure how drunk he was, he does this thing where he has 2 drinks and pretends) we flirted alot and others there thought he liked me. (hes not a flirty boy apparently not even when hes drunk) Our friends there encouraged it. I almost told him I liked him last year. I said Lets talk but just chickened out and left. He went what happened and left me 2 voicemails, 1 saying Hope you got back to your room OK Ill see you tomorrow or IM you He did right away the next morning, his IM was there when I woke up. He was sober while doing this and he didnt tell his friends he did this. But people there that night meddled without asking me and told him Ive liked him. My friend who is close with him asked him if he liked me. He told me he doesnt have feelings for you, everyone else made it worse but hed like to be friends. this guy has never had a girlfriend or kissed a girl. I dont talk to him or his friends hardly at all. This guy still says hi to me all the time on passing. A few times when he did it while I was walking with other people I didnt say it outloud back since he wasnt saying it directly to me. a mutual friend told me he asked if I was acting weird around him too and that they must value my opinion a lot bc theyve asked him alot why I dont respond back. I assume hes worried he hurt my feelings but he also said my bff never told him I liked him earlier though he def. understood what she said.

20080226205159AAJpFGG	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is my friend anorexic? What do I do if she is?	She's lost quite a bit of weight, and she always thinks she's not thin enough (ie she'll complain that she can't ever wear a bathing suit etc). Whenever we tell her to eat she just says that she already ate, or she has to leave room for a big dinner that night. Anyway, I never see her eat, ever. There are other little things like how she complains that she's always cold, and sorta looks pale sometimes or out of it.   I think she does have a disorder, and I want her to get better, but if I try to talk to her she'll just get defensive and ignore me. Then I'll never be able to help!!   What do I do? I love her and don't want to lose her.

20080619104757AAWfbXi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	[Personal/Rant] One week crush? D: ?	This has nothing to do with art in any way or form, this is basically a rant from yours truely, about how I have come to like a guy within one week. Just so you know, I feel really really stupid in liking this guy because A) He is a really sweet guy and everything, but I mean, it's only been a week and a half~! We have hung out together twice, at a party, and bowling. He keeps flirting with me, and I guess I don't notice it, but my friends (who were also hanging out with us) keep telling me I flirt right back~! He calls me every night, and he apologizes to me if he forgot to call me the previous day. It's adorable how he says sorry for things that aren't even a big deal. I can't help but blush even when I look at him.       Weird thing is, I feel kinda pathetic that I like this guy. I mean, I like him, I'm not going to deny it, but have I come to the point where I will like a guy, even if I have only known him for a week? Am I this desprate, or am I really having feelings for this guy?

20080707160105AAQG3AF	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I don't know what to do?	I have been dating my boyfriend for the past nine months and we have been living together for six of those months.  Last week he dropped the bomb on me that he was still married (I knew he had been but thought he was divorced) and that he had a six year old daughter that I had NO idea about.      I'm to the point now that I feel hurt because I was lied to.  I feel bad because everything I gadged my outlook on about him did not include being a Father.  Little kids about the age of six bother me and make me sick to my stomache just to be around them.  Also, he keeps telling me that it doesn't affect our future relationship together, and I believe it does.  Anyone have any advice as to how to get over it?  Has anyone had a simular experience and got over it?

20081002203427AAYWAb3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	23 years of friendship and I can't figure this one out 10pts best?	  I am a little confused on this one. I have known this girl for 23 years.(makes me sound old) We are both 27. We grew up friends and graduated together. We hang out with the same group of friends every weekend. I have had several friends tell me she has a crush on me for the past month. I laughed it off because we are good friends.(she even admitts to being like a sister to me) Well, I have recently noticed a change in her behavior. She invited me to her house last weekend. I thought the same friends would be there for grill'in and a good time. I was the only one invited. So, I thought maybe she is thinking of dating. She told me she wanted to go out the weekend without a big group.(8 including us) I said, ok. All she talked about the weekend was how good friends we are and she considers me her best friend. She even said I would have to approve of the next guy she dates, because she knows I would look out for her.(I took it as a compliment) Now, I'm back to she just wanted a layed back weekend with her best friend vibe. Here is the kicker, she told all our friends we are "talking" and it looks like a serious relationship soon. Last night a mutaul friend had a dinner for some clients and envited all his friends. I was introduced to one of his co-workers and I asked her to go to the game this weekend. My freind(female) was close by and heard. She called me today and asked what are we doing this weekend...you know the two of us. Then said, she would love to go tailgate and watch the game. Then starts talking about some random guy that asked her out and she turned down. At this point, I'm thinking this girl is psycho... she heard me ask the girl out at the dinner last night. My thinking is, if she wants to go out, why doesn't she say something besides how good friends we are and I'm the brother she never had. We have been friends for 23 years, it will take a lot to mess that friendship up. I'm just at a lose of words over it. Oh, and our friends are too. What do ya'll think? Sorry about the long story

20090202084353AAVzutG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think that either of these people might like me?	A) This guy always looks at me and brushes up against me and sits as close to my seat as he can. I was walking with my friend in the hallway and he was staring at her (he knows that she likes her) but then he brushed up against my arm, I was like wtf?! Who does he like me or her? He's not a player and he thinks that she likes him. He thinks I like his brother.      B) This guy was looking at me and copying the way that I stood (not in a bad way though) and when we were sitting he sat the same way. He would also look at me and we would look at eachother for a little while. Do you think that he could like me? His sister was also talking about me to one of there friends.

20090202083305AADGcoh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about my boyfriend?	Okay, well this is the thing. I have a boyfriend and I'm a freshman in high school and he's a sophomore in the same school. Well he hasn't had a lot of girlfriends or whatever and he's really really clingy. And he gets jealous so easily. We have been together a month and i don't think that our relationship is going good. He's really clingy and gets jealous so much, as i said before. My friends don't like him and they say he's really annoying and all over me all the time, and I think it's true. He also says that he's the happiest that he's ever been, while being with me. and I don't feel the same way. What should i do?
20090202083801AAtpVBA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think his facebook status had anything to do with last night?	I was introduced to this guy by friends, and we immediately hit it off, even though I wasn't really seeking a relationship. He pursued me for a month until I finally gave him a date and began to like him on the same level he liked me. The relationship seemed great Never has a man treated me so well, told me I was beautiful, and cared for me so much. Then out of the blue, he tells me that its bad timing in his life (true, he did have financial problems), and that although he likes me, it wouldn't be fair to me to date. His friends were shocked and I was heartbroken. That was 2 months ago.      Last night, I was invited to a party by mutual friends of ours. He came 5 minutes before I had to leave. We just stood there staring at each other, I obviously was terrified and still heartbroken. It was the first time we saw each other or spoke to another in 2 months. And I bet he saw that...he kept asking "How have you been? Are you okay? Are you sure?" I just said yeah I'm fine and was polite. People kept interrupting us, so it got awkward. Apparently it looked like I had something to say and when he asked me if I did, I said well I got to go, bye, he gave me a hug goodbye and I left with the people I came with. I cried on the way home. It still hurts. I think he saw that when he kept asking me if I was okay.      Now I think my ex either figured seeing him made me upset because right on my facebook status page this morning, his status says "*his name* is not thrilled about how he feels or about himself."      I tried contacting him once about 2 weeks after we broke up, but he never responded and it made me feel stupid. I feel so crappy right now, I can't handle trying to contact him again.      btw, the statusi said like 3 in the am. I left the party at 1:30. That's when he got there, so he might have gotten home at 3...so he wrote it right after he got home?
20090202083859AAHVppp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I deal w/ an Ex I work with!?!?!??!! Help!?	Ok, so just this morning, me and the guy I was dating, broke things off. It was kinda bad. Arguing over the phone, not letting each other speak, he even hung up on me (and called back to apologize). Anyway, we work together! how should I deal with that? I know him, he's gonna walk around taking different routes, he's not gonna give me eye contact, etc. Should I play into the same thing and just do my own thing or should I take the higher road and at least say hi, semi-smile, etc? How do I deal?      I don't know if age matters but I'm 26 and he's 29.
20090202091256AAAMIwN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I just can't get over him? Opinions?	My ex fiance left me on christmas eve saying that he needed time to think (we had an argument a couple of days before an I had said some nasty things, mentioning my ex) He didnt contact me for the whole of the festive period, so I thought it was over. Then after new year, he said that he wanted me back. To split up with me again 2 weeks later. I found out that he had had sex with two girls over christmas, although I had ended up in bed with his friend on new years eve ( I was drunk, upset and he was there ) although we didnt have full sex. My ex was saying that he wanted me back, that he couldnt live without me, got me some roses sent to where I work, etc. Then when he asked his mate about what happened with me and him and his friend denied it, my ex thought I had lied about it to hurt him, and split up with me again. Now I see him out and he is getting off with loads of girls, kissing and trying it on with other people, and I dont think its coz he knows that I am there either. I just cant get over him. I am constantly thinking about him, talking about him, analizing everything that has happened. I just cant seem to move on, and surely if he cared as much as he said he did he would be the same? I mean, I know I'm not angel but I dont think I deseved to be treated how he has done me. What do you think? I am 20. I just think that I will never find anyone as good as him, he is a successful builder with his own house and a lot of money, and I have a crappy part time job and live with my parents. Everyone has took his side too. What do you think, help me please?
20090202084205AANMGi9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I stand out from the rest, PLEASE HELP?	I worked hard to be on top. Ivy league school. Top 5% of my class, first string on the team, and president of a club I formed. All my life I struggled to be different and to be a good person.      I am trying to find a steady boyfriend before my junior year starts. I'll be 21 and looking forward to better things, who knows, maybe he can be the ONE!      Problem... the boys I am interested in avoid me. I am trying to get a asian boy that is my equal or better in intelligence and athletics. About a dozen on campus. They tend to politely avoid anything more then casual friendliness with me.       White guys, especially old ones, hover over me like vultures. Both students and professors. I cannot lose them. They even call endlessly on my cell. But the guys I like avoid me like I am a cheap whore at a military base.      I've been sucked into the terrible reputation of asian girls on campus. I cannot say I blame them. Its generally true. Shameless sluts and gold diggers. I expected a better reputation from ivy league girls, but its about the same as a party state school. If I was a intelligent guy I would also avoid me. Statistically its a failure.      How can I show without making it obvious that I am different, that I am very special. I don't want to say "I am different", I want it to show that I am different.       Help, I'll even sign up for the same class he is taking. Sorry dad, that will show up on the bill. Of course I'll sit a row in front of him as not to look obvious and so he can have a good look at me =) .

But things are warming up again - he made the effort to open the door for me on friday, and that night i went to his place and played on his xbox with him (and got a hug - woo!). And then today he came up behind me and hugged me, asking if i was ok and chatting with me...And apparently he was talking with all the guys about how "awesome" i am lol      we used to best friends until the "incident", and he liked me that whole time - a year.      mmm do you think i have a chance???

20090202091724AAXcOG1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I want to be a housewife, anybody else feels the same?	I dont have a real profession and the only thing I am passionate about (profession wise) is writting. I am getting married in March of 2010. I am currently working. I hate my job and the people I work for but I am thankful that I get paid well and that I HAVE a job when so many people are getting laid off.      I never thought I would want to be a housewife. When I was little housewives was to me a pathetic thing to want to be. But now, when I really find no enjoyment in 9-5 positions (or 9 to 8 in reality at this position I am at right now)  and it leaves me with no time whatsoever to clean my house and eat a homecooked meal.      Is it possible to be middle class and have only one working partner? Or in today's economy is vital for both parties to work?   I want to wake up early knowing I have no one to answer to. Have breakfast with my future husband, do the laundry, clean the house, watch golden girls and write.      I feel so selfish by wanting to stay home and not making any money though! I feel that I should contribute more.      What do you guys think?

Today I went into school, just a normal day, until the girl who I'd gotten into a fight last week with due to the fact She my boyfriend, and I are all friends, I told him something I wasn't supposed to and he told her. So today I go in and try to resolve the fight, well we ended up yelling at one another and i dissed her about how she will cheat on her boyfriend and she doesn't care how it makes him feel, and she said 'well at least my boyfriend isn't trying to sleep with my best friend" Well as you can guess that threw me and i stalked off, texted my boyfriend and wrote her a letter to get her to talk to me since she won't talk to my face. He says he dosn't know what she's talking about while she says he texted her and imed her about how he wants to have sex, and has had dreams about it, and how it would be for them. I've been with him for a year and four months, we've fought but i don't think he'd cheat. He got cheated on in his last relationship and it hurt him alot. When i asked him he told me people had his im account and password and said a little while later he found out who did it, his friend Alyssa. So he got her to text me from her phone and tell me she did it. But it still doesn't make up for the supposed text messages. He said his friend Mike had used his phone which could have happened, but I dono. I mean I never trusted this girl, and I don't want to trust him just because I'm blinded by love. Mike is a total perv and I could see him texting someone and saying he wants to do 'things' but i'm confused. I need Help

20081016150233AAtnV9a	Family & Relationships;Friends	This has been hurting me for a while now..?	I just need to do a little venting, but there is a question in this as well..where do I start...      About 2 months ago, I got contacted by this musician named Andrew James. He told me that he was looking for a guitarist and wanted me to be the guitarist. We talked back and forth through some emails, because I was still a little suspicious (how often is it that a successful band contacts YOU for a spot in the band..its usually the other way around) so I told most of my friends about it, they all thought it was a little wierd too, but I kept in contact with Andrew. So I tell my one friend Louie, and I send him the guy's website and tell him how excited I am and how it could be my big break! You know, stuff like that. He was happy for me, and he was in another band at the time, we live in different parts of the province. I was so happy now that we could both be in a band. Anyways, I find out about 2 weeks later after I told Louie about the band, that he contacted them and got in! Now they are preparing to go on tour in Europe and stuff, I am so upset, my good friend who I trusted to tell just about anything, stole my spot, he even acted like he was happy for me, and then backstabbed me, stole the band I was going for, and quit his other band near him for the one closer to me, and now, there is literally not much hope at all left in becoming successful. What should I do? I haven't talked to him since I found out through his ex girlfriend, but the band keeps posting pictures up on Facebook, giving me painful reminders of what I could have had.. I see him in the background and it gets me so down :( Why would a friend do this?? I would NEVER do that to somebody. I am now afraid for my future to tell him anything related to music, because now he gets to be rich and travel the world, while I suffer in a small town with no musically inclined people anywhere! What do you think I should do, and what do you think about what happened? Have you had something this brutal happen to you before? I've been so sad and hurting ever since I found out. I keep having recurring dreams about what would have happened if he didn't take my spot and stuff related to that band.. thats how much it's effecting me every single day.. Thanks for reading that..

20090202200534AA2we12	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Has anyone dated a recovered drug addict? Feeling left out... please help!!?	My BF and father of my baby due in June is a good person. He is a recovered drug addict & has done a lot to turn his life around. We have a relationship with very deep feelings & a lot of passion.     However, he goes through these periods where he will completely shut me out (mostly when he is struggling with "inner demons" & issues that are hard for him to process). He will also make comments that hurt my feelings like "why do you have to invade on my time?" when we're apart & I text him.  He usually realizes how he has come off & apologizes...    but I'm wondering, what can I do to avoid feeling so hurt & left out when he withdraws inward, or turns toward his NA or AA friends?  I know about AlAnon, but any other suggestions?
20090202091524AAVRi6E	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I deal with this situation ruining my relationship?	How do I deal with this situation ruining my relationship. My boyfriend has an old friend whom he had sex with a month or so before we started dating. I don't mind them being casual friends but the thought of them hanging out together bothers me. Sure, he makes sure he's never 'alone' with her but he never invites me, often times doesn't even tell me he's going to see her, and then expects me to be fine with the situation. He says because they're just friends so it shouldn't matter.      We've been together five months and this issue is ruining our relationship. I don't think it's right that he goes and spends time with her without me. When we started dating seriously I transitioned my old boyfriend's and hook ups into casual friends (ie phone and internet friends only). He refuses to acknowledge that this situation hurts me and has the attitude that I can just get over.      What can I do about this? I truly love him and I don't want to break up with him. Am I wrong for being uncomfortable about this?

20090202200621AA2tMjF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help with a boy problem?	I know this is long....but please read it? :)  so there is this guy who i have had a thing for for about the last 2 years. it all started back in the happy days of 9th grade. so here i am, this girl who has been reallly depressed for the last couple of months. its a new semester and this guy in one of my classes starts noticing me. hes 'popular' atheletic, outgoing-the whole shabang. he always tells me i'm way hot and he kisses me on the cheek, flirts out the freaking wazoo with me... i was basically the happiest girl ever. but he was so intimidating to me i never could get the words formed in my brain because i was so smitten by his beauty:). so anyway he goes to a different high school after that year. he lives about two minutes away from me. i never see him anymore and i still want him. i still haven't gotten past thinking he is the most perfect guy ever. no other guy like him has ever gone for me. they will all tell me they think i'm hot but they never try to make a move like he did. i'm scared i'll never get over him. how do i get in contact with him again?

20090202085436AAsZzRs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help! Realllly confused with how I feel about him!?	Rightt...   I know this guy.   He is a wonderful person, great personality etc   But I don't think he is particularly attractive.      We aren't going out but I know that he likes me and we have had a sort of fling type thing. (No sex...just lots of kisses lol)   I think I like him but I'm not sure.      I have really bad self-confidence issues and personally I don't think I'm ugly but I constantly think that everyone else does. So I keep on meeting guys that I think are really nice AND gorgeous but convincing myself that I'm not pretty enough for them so I end up going out with somebody that I don't think is good looking because I think thats the best I'll ever do.      This is what I think I'm doing now. And every time this happens I go out with them, then regret it and realize I don't actually like them as much as I thought and finish them, leaving them pissed at me and upset. =/   I don't want to hurt this guy but I'm really not sure whether I really like him or not.   I know the whole 'love is blind' thing and I definitley place personality wayyyyyy before looks.   But I want to have a bf I can love inside and out... not just inside if you know what I mean. =/   Wow, I must sound so shallow.      What to you think?
20090202090753AAM1hg4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Someone please help me my heart is broken and I don't know what to do about my ex (baby's dad)?	So if you read my other questions we, me and my baby's dad,  have been arguing ever since we found out that we were pregnant... I will sum them up for ya to give you back ground. We were in a two year relationship... and we are both adults.  When I first told him we were pregnant... he said abortion was my only option, so we stopped communicating basically because it was not an option for me. He would send me texts saying how if I came after him for child support he would make our daughter's life hell. I told him I did not know what was going to happen that I had enough to deal with being pregnant. I continued to get hate texts.   When I was 20 weeks... so two weeks ago I get a call asking if he could come visit. I said sure but why all of a sudden... he said that he would come visit me if while he was down here I would have an abortion. I hung up on him. He said that he hated that thought of having a child out there while he was not ready... Ever since the beginning I have told him that I wanted nothing from him but if I ended up needing any help at all that I would keep us out of court because he did not want that.   He refused to tell his dad about the baby, so I called and talked to him and he was happy I called... this is his first grandbaby.  I did give my ex the choice but he refused so I told him.   Well now last night I left my phone at home and went out for a while and when I came back I had two texts from my ex. They literally said that if I did not have an abortion and took him to court that he would kill himself because he refused to pay child support. I text him as soon as I read it.! My heart is breaking. If I need financial help I don't know what to do... I do not want him to kill himself... and if he is just threatening that is not funny and really horrible. I am so confused... I will not have an abortion... that is not an option, so if I am leaving him alone why is he doing this. I have told him over and over... that I would not discuss this until the baby was here because I did not want the stress and did not know what I wanted now and would have a better idea after our daughter was here.   I have tried to accommodate him in every way possible... and he won't budge. It's his way or no way... and the only thing I won't budge on is the abortion and he is threatening to kill himself. How and what do I need to do to deal with this? What should I do? He says he wants to terminate his rights and then he wants to keep them. I have kept all the texts and emails. I don't want him to hurt her and he is so mad I would be afraid that if he got any rights to her he would because he knows how much she means to me... help!! I don't know what to do!?!!?! I am confused.

20090202082920AANVcpV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What the heck is up with mixed signals (Males, especially - Is there a code I don't know about?)?	In a nutshell:      A guy came in the office for a meeting, we flirted a little, he called work the next day to ask if I'd go to dinner with him "sometime".  A couple months of texting ensued before we met for dinner (Are phone calls illegal now?) - everyone at his company was overworked then.  Dinner was awkward, but not bad as first dates go.  More texting for a few weeks before *poof* it stopped, as if there was a mutual, silent agreement.  (OK, shrug and move on.)  ~~  That was roughly a year ago.      He still comes in the office for meetings, calls my boss, and sends me work-related e-mails.  We're always polite and friendly - there's no reason not to be.  Quite randomly, I've seen him and this-one-woman at my church 3 or 4 times in the last few months - noteworthy in passing, but not remotely earth-shattering.      BUT:      What confuses me is that the e-mails always include a lot of exclamation points and even SMILEY faces, for God's sake.  And, like an e-mail I just received, there are phrases like "I hope all is well with you...".  (What's the "..." supposed to mean?)      Anyone have any idea what's going on here?  ...Dating is overrated, by the way.  : )

20090202193939AAxaGm7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I always re-play memories of my ex and me?	Sorry for asking in this section, I just want more experienced answers.      Well, to put it short, my ex boyfriend pursued me again after breaking up with me.  We basically were on and off from June-December. We were "on" during winter break but without the label. He even said that he wanted to work things out but we both agreed to hold off on the label. Then another girl comes along; and he totally forgets about me. No contact. No calls, texts, NOTHING. We have not talked for a month now. I don't want him back because he's such a jerk.. and I know that now. I am actually relieved to be rid of him. I have a class with him everyday. Even though I know he is a jerk now, I always think back on when he wasn't a jerk: during the summer. When I hear songs that make me think of the summer and "us", I still get sentimental. I know it's not that long but it was my first relationship and I feel like I should be over it by now, but it is constantly on my mind. I know I should keep busy, and I have been, but I'm always constantly re-playing great memories between us in my head and it's getting old. Any idea on how to cope with this? (BTW-I'm 17).

20090202195708AA9HkVb	Family & Relationships;Family	Can someone please edit my essay?	As a thirty- four year old woman who once endured an unstable home life, teen pregnancy, and a period of homelessness, I realize the necessity and value of an education. My life experiences have impelled me to further my education and pursue a Master’s degree in Social Work. I have prevailed through numerous tribulations and my goal is to become a social worker so I can, in return, ensure that others will overcome life’s hardships.   During my childhood, I lived in a single parent family household with my mother. Our relationship suffered due to numerous arguments and a lack of understanding one another. Needless to say, when I confided in my mother that I was pregnant, our relationship completely dissipated. There was too much family conflict and the environment became increasingly unhealthy. Eventually, I became homeless. Everyday became a constant struggle. Not only was I homeless, but I was about to have a baby, had no money and no support. I felt alone as though nobody cared about my situation. However, I eventually found a shelter on Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. Thankfully, at the shelter, I met a social worker who helped ease my concerns. She provided constant support and gave me a sense of hope. She encouraged me to resolve my conflict with my mother and return home. When I moved back home, I made a sincere effort to heal my relationship with my mother.   Six months later, I found a job as a counselor, working with adolescents who had experienced similar situations to mine. I began my preparation to achieve my personal goal while I worked at Harbor View Adolescent Center, a level-14 group home facility, as a youth counselor. My primary work responsibility was serving as a positive role model for adolescents from twelve to eighteen years of age. The adolescents had backgrounds of being homeless and victims of physical and sexual abuse. Others had problems with drug and alcohol abuse, depression, and the criminal justice system. At times, the position was extremely stressful but I discovered that I had the ability to connect with the children and develop strong emotional ties with them. I focused upon several areas of treatment, including their social skills, coping skills, and independent living skills. My main ambition was to help them build their self-esteem and improve their sense of security.  As a youth counselor, I gained valuable experience in listening to adolescents and helping them make positive decisions to improve the quality of their lives.    From my personal experiences, I learned that I had the ability to persevere through my most challenging times. I developed empathy for people struggling with everyday problems and, most importantly, I learned the importance of having support from my family. I am committed to helping others achieve personal growth and take an interest in their own well- being. As a result of my homelessness, I understand the constant despair and frustration experienced by those who find it challenging to cope with life’s everyday problems. I am also convinced that increasing one’s own sense of empowerment can make the difference between a future of despondency or one filled with hope.   I am applying to the Master’s in Social Work program because it is my goal to help others embrace their inner potential and make a positive life transition. Most importantly, I want to become a professional social worker because I want to do everything that is within my power to enhance the quality of a person’s life. I want to address the needs of all people in my community; especially it’s most vulnerable or “at-risk” members.  I am deeply committed to the service of others, and most specifically to the service of troubled and neglected youth. I am confident that I will succeed as a social worker and transform the lives of many.   I have always been deeply concerned about the welfare of the most vulnerable members of our society, particularly troubled and neglected youth. I believe that each of us has a duty to help and serve others, to seek out marginalized and less fortunate members of our communities and offer any aid we are able. I have always lived by the motto “do unto others as you would have done to you,” and feel that the best way to express this belief is to devote my life to social justice. I feel that respect and dignity are the foundations upon which social justice is built. It recognizes that every human being is worthy of respect and possesses dignity, prevents injustice, affords basic human rights, and fosters self-confidence. When we as a society try to see the world through the eyes of the less fortunate, we can empathize with and understand one another instead of focusing on our differences. Only when each and every member of a community is able to earn the same level of dignity and respect can a society truly be called civilized. Those who cannot demand social justice for themselves must have a voice to demand it for them. It is my hope that I can be that voice,

20090202202400AAMHfQY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you keep dating someone who did this?	After a bunch of good dates she started ignoring attempts to talk to her (not even frequent trials, once a day at best).  After a week of getting 1 text message from her (I used to average around 125 from her) I stopped trying.  2 weeks after that now she IM'd me and tried to start up a conversation... however I kept it brief since I had to go to class.  Later today though her facebook status changed to 'is worried about a certain friendship.  I don't know what to do'      I'm not sure either.  She flat out ignored me for 3 weeks and just now started talking to me... do I just forgive/forget?  I honestly don't know what's going on...
20090202201146AAsWyzb	Family & Relationships;Family	How Can I Show My Mom She Is Ruining My Life?	She's always yelling or complaining. About the stupidest things! If a pot isn't in the right spot, get out of the house and town, or you'll get yelled at for the rest of the day. If somebody isn't 100% perfect, or messes up 1 little thing, she goes off. She walks away, like they did something wrong, and complains/yells to me about it. Like, she's a *****!, or I don't know, I can't think right now. My life when I'm at school, not with my mom, I'm smiling, I'm happy, I'm who I want to be. At home, I'm held back, I'm yelled at, and all this. She said right now "Maybe you should go to a residental school" or w/e like living away from home. She has also told me I should live in a mental hospital. I've heard it more than once. She calls me fat to my face. She says I have issues, to my face. My mom doesn't know how my life is.      How Can I Show Her, that She's Ruining My Life?      At school, I forget about home, I forget about her, and I act like my life is perfect, because there are people there that actually want me.

20090202202123AA20i56	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do i like him? or am i just confused about a good friend?	A guy. He's been of my closest friends for the past three years. We talk almost everyday, get along really well, hang out at least a few times a week.. I don't feel self conscious around him or get butterflies and I don't think he's hot.. I'm just very comfortable around him and it's easy to be myself, but lately I've been sort of confused... do I like him? Do I have to be attracted to him to like him? The idea of making out seems gross but just cuddling seems fine (perhaps nice??).. HELP

20090202202006AAJf7YV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I mis-reading her?	Perhaps i am clueless on how to read women so lets see.  I have been going to this Sonic for a few weeks now and this one carhop in particular seems to always bring out my food whenever she is working, now maybe it is because I always tip her but here lately she has been taking a bit more time to talk with me about her personal life, just little things mostly and then one day after she had dropped off my food she I asked how her day was going and she told me it was okay and then she proceeded to tell me that she was working this same shift the next day.  I didn't ask her, she just told me.  now i figure I am most likely reading it wrong and she just wants my money...lol...but is there any chance that she might possibly be interested in me and that is why she told me that?  I want to ask her out sometime but I don't want to look like a fool if I am wrong...hehe.... so what do you think
20090202200442AA8rFgh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Be Honest, Girls...What turns you on in a guy (as far as looks go)?	For me, it's dark features (like dark eyes and hair), smooth tan skin stretched over a fit body, an easygoing smile, and very expressive facial movements (like raising his eyebrows or flashing me a sideways glance) when he talks.  I like a little bit of facial hair, if it's kept neat and defines the person.  Not everyone can pull off the thin black hair along the jawline, but if he can...damn!  And if there's a somewhat sly smile, I only fall that much faster.  So all of this...Something that says he's an overall rogue.  What does it for you?  And guys...what's your secret to make the ladies fall?  I'm just trying to figure out what it is that sweeps me off my feet faster than cars and snow sports of pretty much any kind!  Just curious.
20090202201036AArLGU7	Family & Relationships;Family	My dad...?                      ?	My mom divorced my dad seven years ago. he was very abusive to both myself and my mother and two brothers.

20081025133656AAih9Hy	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I help my misguided friend fight temptations.?	So, there are many levels to this story. My friend pierced her va-jay-jay on a dare. I thought that was as bad as it was going to get. But recently she was at work and had a little breakdown. That same day a friend of hers asked if she would like a smoke of weed. So she took some, and then when driving another friend asked her if she would like some and they had some. So from what I heard basically she got hi. She said after she had a class and couldn't speak and the class after that she couldn't stop messing with her hair and fidgeting with her face.      I told her she shouldn't do it again, but she is really gullible and can't say no. She has this serious issue of not saying no and I worry about her. I've known her for only a couple of years and I see her swaying off course because of lack of enthusiasm or stress. So what can I do to help her beyond telling her it's wrong.

20081014012003AAqMkPQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it okay to date shortly after breaking up, before getting divorced?	My wife and I are a young couple in our mid-20s.  We have been together 4 years, and after a year and a half of marriage, it fell apart.  Our relationship suffered from a lot of major problems to the point where I told her I wanted to separate, but it dragged on for a few more months.  It's finally over and we've broken up, but now I have a dilemma.  We only separated a week ago, but I have a friend that I want to start dating already.  That friend feels the same way, but I'm concerned that it might be wrong to start dating someone new this quickly.      I was ready to leave my marriage a long time ago, but I kept giving us more chances to fix the problems, which never happened.  As a result, even though we only broke up a week ago, I already feel like I'm ready to move on.  In fact, once we split up, I felt like a weight had been lifted from my shoulders.  So I don't think it's an issue of whether or not I'm ready to start dating again, because I feel that I am.  I'm just not sure if it's... well, "right" for me to start dating again so soon.  Also, does the fact that we're not "officially" divorced yet matter at all?

20081023211945AAKQNVA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is a good way to become more closer to him?	I really want to become more closer to my bf. We kiss, its just not often. He doesn't read my hints well like today he gave me a ride to school and I said "I don't want to go." and put my head on his shoulder and stuck my lips out. He didn't get the message, so no kiss. We hold hands all the time and are next to each other every second we can be. I want to make him something, like a key chain. I am good at those. Do u think this is a good idea? I just i don't know, want him to stay with me and know he is mine. But I don't want to be the gf that drives him crazy. We have been going out 5 weeks now. He spoils me to death. He is so nice and has good manners and defends me. How do I keep a guy like this?

20081102192104AAA4XQ9	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	A question about the matters of the heart...            ?	I don't feel loved.Well, sometimes I feel loved. Like when I do something right or if I get a good grade or if I make 1st chair in region band, or if my solo went well or something. But it's like I'm only known, I'm only loved for my accomplishments. I want to be able to just show my true self and not be judged, and just be accepted for who I am.  I'm very lonely, and my parents aren't exactly always there for me. Basically... they are alcoholics... It's not like the story's, I don't hate my parents. But they don't love me. I know they don't. I've never heard them say it; I've never said it. I don't love them, and as far as I'm concerned they are just people I live with until I go to college.  At school I'm kind of an outsider... I'm not like everybody else... All the girls have boyfriends or getting over a break-up before they get back into the dating scene. (I'm in middle school by the way.) Getting a boyfriend isn't really an option right now. I'm always so busy since I'm taking all Pre-AP classes, 1st chair in band, not to mention keeping the house clean, cooking dinner, and stuff... Sometimes I want to just get out of my life forever but I know suicide is not really an option. It's stupid, and I've been down that road before, and it lead me nowhere. I just want to be loved for who I am...

20081102194624AAQ5oXS	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do i make this stop? I need ADVICE PLEASE?	Im 29 weeks pregnant the father has been in and out of my life during this time. at 3 months pregnant i caught him in bed with another women it hurt me really bad then she ended up living with him he was still talking to me but not as much. I would see them everyday together because i had to move in with my grandmother which just happend to be across the street. He was going to move to west virgina with her but something happend and he had to come back my concern is he just comes to me when he needs something like Money,Ciggarettes, or a place to stay when him and her are fighting i still love him he tells me everytime hes done with her and he just goes right back to her. There is violence in their relationship he comes to my house with bloody noses and black eyes i dont want my baby in that type of lifestyle when hes born. Is there a way for me to tell him no without making him mad? I just cant stand the mind games anymore and the stress is overwhelming. 
20081102195401AAFzhiM	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I know she will never love me?	I have been given the opportunity to of been loved by two mothers. My biological mother left me and my sister when I was 5 (my sister 3) and I didn't meet her again untill I was 14, since then I've seen her maybe once every 2-3 years.    My father remarried when I was 7ish to my stepmother, they now have two children together. He had full custody of us and my biological mother paid no child support and does not help us financially while we are both in college now.    My stepmother emotionally abused us since the birth of their first child together and my biological mother has since remarried and is trying to concieve with her new husband, who I have yet to meet because he does not know her real age and if he met me and my sister (we're much older now, 22 and 20) he would know that she's a lot older than she has told him.    Back to my point, Sometimes I feel like I am missing something...but how can you miss something if you've never had it? I've never had a mother figure love me or look at me as their own. Since as long as I can remember, I've always longed for my stepmother to love me or my biological mother to help me in times of need and never recieved either.    I fear that one day I will be a terrible mother and the children I have yet to have will suffer. I am no where near having children but I still am very scared. I feel so sad when I hear my stepmother telling her family how she thinks of me and my sister, and I feel sad when I hear how my biological mother wants to have new babies now when she couldn't even help take care of the two she's had over 20 years ago!    I know that neither will ever love me, but where do I go from here? I feel that its my fault that I was given two chances and somehow failed at both. Please give me your advice and thank you in advance.

20081104110453AAR6707	Family & Relationships;Family	How does a teenage girl deal with her mom's boyfriend's ANNOYING CHILDREN?	My mom is serious and is talking about marriage with a man with two boys- a 5 year old and an eleven year old.  They are both such annoying brats!!  They get into my stuff and spit.  They kick and the 5 year old even curses- words even I wouldn't imagine saying- on a daily basis.  The eleven year old is a compulsive liar, and has even keyed his father's car.  Whenever I tell my mom that this horrible family WILL ruin our family life (my mom, little sister, and older brother are so close), she always says the same thing- "I love him and I'm willing to risk anything to make this work."  So obviously there is no convincing her that this family from hell will take us down with them.  How do I deal with this??  Please help!

Also he's told me before a bunch of times about how beautiful one of my friends is although that has stopped recently and also this one time a month ago (a little before winter break) someone said to us that it's like we're dating and then after that he became really distant for a while and i didnt talk to him until school started up again. We had even had plans to do something that day the person said that but he had cancelled.... and i dont know. i just i dont want to make the first move...and it's scary. because i really like him so much and I'm afraid if he doesnt like me that 1) i'll be so embarrassed, but also 2) that our friendship would be over and he really is so important to me so AHHHH i dont know if he actually likes me!!      what do you think?

20090126093505AABvOWE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Crying as I typed this out - I really need some serious answers, PLEASE PLEASE help me out?	I don't want to sound over dramatic or emotional, but here goes - My ex and I had been together for 15 months. I feel so blessed that I got to know him. I thank God everyday for that, because when I lost my mother at the age of 10 I lost a part of me with her death, when my ex came to me, and the two of us grew in love I felt that part of me getting complete once again. He was my first love, and I was his first love. He was the one who ended it though, but there was a very valid reason behind it so I'm not angry with him. However, when he ended it I told him that he shouldn't regret his decision later on. We broke up in Aug of last year. He got with someone in Oct of last year, and I got with someone in Nov of last year. I'll be honest, my current guy is the re-bound guy. I thought I had to move on so I got with him HOPING to forget my ex, and my ex had done the same thing (he even told me so). One night we were talking and he told me that in Semptember when I mentioned to him about this guy liking me (my current boyfriend) he was shattered but didn't make it obvious over the phone, and that same night he was planning to ask me back but since I told him what I did, he decided to move on, and so Oct he asked out his current girlfriend, and since I thought he moved on I said yes to my current guy in November. He told me all this lately, and I was so shocked. He also mentioned that what I told him when we broke up about never regreting the decision he made, he said that he now values that statement of mine. I'm in a mess.. the thing is, I do like my current boyfriend and even my ex likes his current girlfriend, but I know what love is and I am def. not in love. I don't know what to do, because my ex and I talk almost everyday, sometimes for hours. Nothing has changed actually, our conversations are the same, he makes me laugh, and I do too. His girl and my guy don't know we talk though. I feel bad about one thing - When things were good with my guy, I wasn't thinking much about my ex. I really feel bad about that. I don't know if my current guy is serious about me. We've fought a lot. And he and his girl don't really get to communicate. My friends told me that someday we'll get back because they believe that guys are the type who will not wait around for something if they don't think they had a chance, where as my ex calls me late at night, messages me frequently, confides in me, send me a message saying he's hearing a song that reminds him of me? for what? This is their estimation. Guys, I really don't know what to do? Should I end it with my current guy? It's all killing me, i DO like my current guy, but I know for sure, that I will never ever be able to get over my ex, I've tried it and failed. And I know he's not able to get over me too. If I end it with my current guy I have no guarantee that he'll end it with his ex though. What do I do? End it and just hope? I'm so confused, I need some serious answers please. :'(

I was married 5 years and have son.My husband has been abusive the past few years and he always hints me that we might get divorce.Ths story is very long but my main question is.      Yesterday i went out with my husband and girlfriend,we all came from work and we work in different places.My husband sat next to my friend in the restaurant and im sitting the otherside of the table.I acted cool about it and let it pass.We were discuss issues and i saw my girlfriend put her hand on my husband's shoulder as in joke manner and we all laughed but im still surprise what im seeing and my husband started to make jokes with her.When we left the restaurant i was trying to pull my hair back so i asked my husband if he can hold the some papers and files i was carrying and he said no i wont so we just walked and she told me give it to me,so i gave her to hold for me and i did pull my hair back quickly.So im busy with my hair and they are walking infront of me so my husband told her give me the files and books i will carry and she is like no its ok and he told her no give it to me i will carry u dont have to carry anything u r a lady. I didnt believe what im seeing. I told later when we went home that his behaviour was very weird and he was like i dont think so because if i want to be with ur friend i can. He always hints for me that he is no more interested in the relationship. Do you think there is anything left in this marriage and what do u think i should do? Im 27

We are really compatible. I dont want more than just a friendship here right now because obviously    I dont really know him. We exchanged picutures (he isnt one of the OMG UR HOT kinda guys. He just seems real and is really cute. Ive seen his myspace, youtube and kind of checked him out. He seems real. I read his comments. Not to be a stalker but just to see what this guys all about) We have alot in common and our conversations through IM last for hours. And he is really sweet. He doesnt call me hot or sexy, he calls me beautiful and gorgeous. He seems really genuine. I NEVER in a million years would have EVER thought that I would talk to someone online and send them pictures. But it a sense its no different then walking into a mall and having abunch of strangers no you, right? Well i just dont want this to go the wrong way especially since he lives 2 1/2 hours away from me in the same state. I guess what Im asking is for a little input from people. Is all of this harmless or should I really be careful and put up my gaurd? thankyou :)

It was for about three years. Anyway I moved on to regular high school and he now goes to another high school. But the students of that school have to wait in my high school's lobby for their buses. Over the summer I had tried my best to move on, and I did. Until just recently when ever I come in the lobby his friends are standing, almost blocking the door way and he's with them. And today he was staring at me while I was talking to my friend Shay. Does this mean something? Or are they just being assholes? If they keep doing this, it's going to drive me crazy...plus it's embarassing.

At one point, my guy said that if someone were to really pursue me, I would lose interest. Yet, HE doesn't want to be exclusive. I know he has insecurities and so do I. I just know that what we have is rare - I can't even describe it. He's not a young guy, he's 29. I just wonder, what would hold him back from being with me? If he's just not into me, why does he treat my like his girlfriend in front of everyone and tell me that no one looks at me the way he does and much more. He is confused so he is obviously confusing me. I told him we couldn't talk anymore and he has called for random, illegitimate reasons, just to have a reason to talk to me. But he won't say anything important, like how he feels! What should I do and what might he be doing??? Im' not trying to play games, I just want to be with him ultimately!!

20090202082928AAmhf5X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will you help me out please?	There's a girl that works at the Sonic drive in here in town that I'd like to ask out. The problem is, I'm not sure how to do it without seeming desperate, or even worse, creepy ha ha.      Shes started going to the same gym that I do, and I was thinking about asking her there, but she's not been coming as often.      So basically, the only time I get to see her is when I pull up to the window to get my order. We usually have a little conversation, she'll say something like "so did you go to the gym yesterday?" Then we'll talk about that for a little while before she thanks me for coming and tells me to be careful on my way home,or if she's delivering the food to the cars, and sees she she'll smile & wave.      So, my question for you is, how could I ask her out without scaring her off? I'm not sure if she's even single or not, but there's a good chance she is. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

He agreed, but then we got delayed for some reason. He said we'll go tomorrow. And I walked off.After sometime he came to me and was trying to convince me. I kept some money at the place where we sat thinking that he took it. And we both left. But later we realized that none of us took it and we lost. He yelled at me for my negligence and my crooked behavior.Later We spent sometime together talking and then returned home.       I forgot about it now, but he's still feeling bad for it. He's going on telling me sorry and I can't see that artificial smile on his face.How can I make him happy now?
20090202082937AA1O45B	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to deal with trust issues.....?	I have been in a relationship for over a year now with a man that I love.  We had a rocky time back in spring of 08 due to some of his past issues.  Needless to say, at that point we had some trust issues that were broken.  We are back together after a two month "need for space"  and have been back together for seven months now.  The problem is now mine... even though he had part in causing it.  I am having a difficult time with trust issues and he has been working on showing me proof that I can trust him.  That is why I say the problem is mine, my own fears and insecurities have manifested into potential problems with us.  He is still by my side with it but my mind races at times and it seems as if I try to find things to be suspicious about and one thing leads to another in my head until I confuse myself and have trust issues again.  It seems to be a vicious cycle.  I work in the medical field and have talked to professionals that state some of what I am dealing with is normal for the situation.  My question is... does anyone know the best way to cope or can share experiences with me to cope?  I know hypnosis, EFT, and about cognative behavior thearpy.... Please share.... Thanks in advance
20090202082939AABPrzQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's a girl to do when she's torn between two guys?	The first guy is my best friend, he and I share a lot of things in common & we talk almost everyday but the problem with him is that he likes some other chick but doesn't want to make her his gf yet. He shows signs of liking me (tickles me, teases me and calls me pet names like baby, boo and whatnot) and others have noticed it as well but he's just flat out confusing. Others have told me that he's playing both of us so therefore Im confused. The second guy, I met just recently at a meeting. We just started talking via phone. He's very nice, sweet and funny and during our phone conversation he told me that he likes me very much & wants to get to know me. The second guy likes me but my feelings for him haven't reached that level yet, he's sweet and all but I don't like him in that way yet because I still like my best friend very much (even though he's so confusing and could be playing me and that chick) Should I wait for my best friend and possibly get hurt or should I give the second guy who already told me he likes me a chance? I don't want to hurt the second guy but I really like my best friend more.

20090202085553AAeIDzZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I blew it...is there anything I can do to make things up to her?	Earlier there was a very promising possibility of a potential relationship with a girl I'd been talking to online for the past 2 weeks.  In the beginning she expressed a lot of interest but now I think I've completely blown things though (by IM'ing and e-mailing too frequently -- she currently seems to be completely ignoring me).  The only thing is, when she was interested, she was e-mailing and IM'ing me very frequently too, so I had thought she really wouldn't mind if I did the same?    I tried apologizing to her for moving too fast but it seems to not be doing any good.  Should I just give up at this point, or is there anything else I could try?  She was so nice and we had seemed to be been coming along so well until I messed up :(

20090202084223AAGvgsK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does my boyfriend not want to spend time with me?	My boyfriend and I have been together for two years now, he is currently trying to get into a college program which requires him to practice or dedicate a lot of time to his guitar. He comes to visit me every other week usually from sunday night to wednesday morning. He told me today that he won't be coming on sunday because he is watching the Grammys. I think that he is taking me for granted, like he knows he can have me whenever he wants, or is in the mood. It bothers me that he would put a T.V. show before us. I didn't ask him to give up watching the Grammys, I simply asked him to watch it here so we could at least spend the night together. He thinks I'm being immature. I don't think it's about him coming here anymore, I just want him to want to see me. I want him to say look this is happening, but I miss you and I want to see you, and we'll arrange something. Why is he acting this way? How can I fix it? What do I need to do for him to want to be with me? Am I crazy for wanting him to make some sacrifices for me? Is it too much to ask for him to watch the show here on sunday so we can be together afterwards at least?

20090202084258AAdVGh7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP! What's he thinking?	(Guy's and girls opinion please!)   I've known him for a few years, and he's always trying to make me laugh.   I was sitting on a couch, and he seemingly tripped and fell next to me, but kind of on me.   He didn't get up until I told him to.   Not only that but he's always trying to convince that he's "All muscle".   He tells me about how much he's been working out, etc. etc.   Some friends, and my mom (so embarrassing!) have said he likes me, but I don't know.   A friend of his told me he liked me, but I don't know if I should trust him.   Not only that, but one time this girl ran up to him and asked if he liked me,when I was right in front of him.   He said no, without any hesitation.   The guy is prone to be mean to me, but sometimes he's nice.   I'm wondering if he's just a jerk.   He can be nice sometimes, and he's great with kids (Except when a baby drooled on him. Then he pretended to wipe it off on me... :( )   And once during a Mystery Murder dinner, we were coupled and he kept putting his arm around me all night, and calling me "Baby".   He doesn't even seem to talk to other girls, though his friends once told me about this girl he would run up to and dance with.   It seemed weird that they would just tell me this.

20090202085435AAZ3Wr7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can you be indifferent to a sexual type kiss?	My married friend has a male best friend. He was recently bedridden for a couple of days (nothing serious) and I visited him with her. Before leaving she leant over him for a hug; I was more than a little surprised to see him repeatedly kiss & nuzzle her neck, upper chest and cheek for several minutes while they chatted and joked - not just pecks, but lingering sucking of flesh between lips. She said afterwards that the attraction is all one way, she's completely indifferent, wouldn't kiss him on the lips and only allows it because she likes him so much as a friend.    Personally I couldn't find feel 'indifferent', I'd either enjoy it, or be pretty repelled, depending on whether I was attracted to the guy or not.   Just wondering what anyone else thinks?

20090202090251AAX2wvI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I sound 'submissive' saying this?	I've known a guy for 3 years.  We use to be friends and over xmas I told him that I was interested in dating him.  He said that he didnt feel the same way about me.      He gave me a lot of mixed signals (being nervous, fidgity, looking at me, teasing), so I thought I should ask.      Since then (about a month ago) I havent seen him or even emailed him.  I miss our emails and friendship.  But, it's for the best that I dont contact him....to get over my feelings and move-on.      However, we may run into each other 2-3x/week.  Right now, I am avoiding that.        I want to tell him, that I'm NOT mad at him.  Would this look like I am being submissive to him...      Cause before I asked him out....I chased him (I thought that was the way to get closer)(apparently not!)      I want to look like I have confidence and dont need him.....

20090202090323AAOsZGs	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this normal or does this mean i dont love my husband?	Lately I find myself thinking a lot about my ex-fiance. My new job is near where he use to live when I was with him. I have to drive by there 4 days a week. My thoughts are about missing him and some of the things we use to do I've even thought about contacting him or looking him up just to see how he's doing. ( Its also important to know he was my first 4 everything kissing etc. And I was the won who broke things off because mentally at the time he was unstable in a way that it would have been impossible to start the family I've always wanted because he was suicidal ) The only thing that stops me from trying to look him up is knowing that if my husband found out it would not sit right with him. I've been married for nearly 4 years have two beautifull children and we have a pretty normal happy marrage. Is thinking about my ex this often normal considering the cercomstances or am I not as in love with my husband as I thought I was.

Also, I had moved in 6-7 months after we have been together plus that happened when we were both very stressed in both our lives. So of course, after a couple months after I moved in with him, it was down hill from stress we believe. So now we both believe it is best to move out and start over. Nothing we fought about were ever about us, I was just very negative but when I am not stressed things are so perfect. So starting over seems to be the best thing. We will see each other every week, and still be together just spending some time alone. We both believe this is not going to hurt anything, it is the best solution. Does anyone have any stories in common they can share, if not. Can you please discuss with me what your opinion is. Our relationship has nothing wrong with it. We are so happy just both of us are stressed from separate lives like work and kids. Thank you for reading. Anything else you would like me to add. Just say so.

20090202092023AA7Heub	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think that I should do about me and my boyfriend?	Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 3 months it is almost 4 now here is the thing I love him to death and everyone thinks that he is bad for me. Sometimes I kinda think that by the things that he does to me like for example I thought my friend turned against me and tried to take him away from me just because he told me that she was trying to do that. Then one night I ask him about it and he tells me the truth then tells me that he doesn't want me to have any friends and that he hates them all even my own mother! Now after he told me the truth about all that I just hung up the phone on him because I thought that it was just crazy! He already doesn't let me talk to guys now he is trying to get rid of everyone that I say anything to. What do I do? Do I tell him to stop or what? He is also BI-Polar so that might be a problem to.

20090202202224AAeLXCt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get him to listen and forgive me?	I started dating a new guy recently (nothing serious), when me and my ex started to hang out again.  My ex knew about the new guy I was dating, and he obviously wasn't necessarily happy about it, but he never asked me to stop seeing the other guy.  I Love my ex, and want to be with him, but so many times we've started dating again just to have it fall apart, so I didn't want to rush into ending it with the new guy, just to be let down by my ex again.     The other night my ex asked me when the last time I had seen this new guy was, and if I had slept with him.  I told him it had been 4 days earlier and that it wasn't his business if I had slept with him. (he took this as a yes, which is the truth) He got mad, then calmed down and said it was fine, then got mad again, and now he wont return my phone calls or even talk about it! What do I do?  I feel awful, I'm more than willing to stop seeing the new guy, I just want my ex to stop treating this like I cheated on him, and to let it go.

And then she got mad and was like 'Oh so it's not because you want to?'      And I said, 'No, I want to, because if I don't you'll get mad.'      She's all mad now. Did I say something wrong?
20090202212107AADKHG6	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend is dating this ridiculously stupid girl and I am getting really annoyed!?	Alright, she is hot, but not hot enough for me to tolerate that level of stupidity. Example: we go to an Indian restaurant and she isn't sure about going in because, "don't they eat cow stomachs or something". No joke, that one is real. I laugh at her all the time, and she just gets mad. The other day I got really pissed because she started throwing a fit because he and I were having a political discussion and she was mad because she felt stupid because she couldn't contribute. That one I got really annoyed and told her to be quiet and listen and maybe she would learn something. Me and a few other friends feel we need to have a talk with him. How do we approach it?
20090202211108AAObUVs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Holy cow I just found out my 30 year old friend is a virgin! What the heck?	I wonder how this happens? Its like that movie. I asked him about it and he was embarrassed but he said he got close a few times but decided he wanted to wait. I told him he was missing out on a lot. I guess he used to be pretty religious, but I wonder if he is just digging himself into a deeper and deeper hole. Women probably won't think he's normal and now that he's 30, they probably won't even bother with him. He's a normal guy so maybe I can help him out before its gets too weird. What do you think?
20090203011347AAC5JvO	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I Need Some Opinions/Advice...Can you help me?	Well,I've been with my boyfriend on and off for about two years,i truly love him,hes my other half.Since day one there's been another girl in his life that he claims to be only his "friend".In the beginning of our relationship i didn't mind her too much [she was his ride half the time because his license was suspended]...but i fell in love with him [which i obviously wasn't trying to do...but **** happens] and now things that didn't affect me before do now,but not because im plain paranoid but because now i realize I've been in denial and "living a lie' so to speak.My boyfriend went to jail for a few months and during that time we wrote to each other [i couldn't go visit him due to my age] and he told me that she was visiting him and putting money on his books etc. and that bothered me a little,but what could i do? There has always been rumors of them being in a relationship together [but the people that told me were all known liars so that didn't help anything,but i still confronted him on the subject] but now...the same people that told me that now tell me that their engaged,which again makes things sketchy but one of my very close friends that knows her told me its true.But the thing that erks me the most is no matter how much i want it to be a lie my gut feeling is telling me somethings up.Your probably wondering "if you've been with him for so long how could you not know?!" well here's the thing we practically lived together before and we'd both come and go at the same time,but now hes staying with his cousin and we rarely get to see each other.Yes I've always disliked the girl [she HATES me with a burning passion -my friends quote from her-] she would always get my man in trouble they both did dumb things together and point blank they are both bad influences on one another.I've asked him a million times for the truth...and he swears its a bullshit lie,and its not like i can go speak to her about the situation.And to add on to everything else the friends we had together he no longer talks to so i cant go ask them,plus the only person im close to in his family moved.If i leave him without knowing the facts im wrong and if i don't and he actually is with her im still in the wrong,its a double edged sword. What can i do? Im literally at my breaking point,please help.

20090202211655AAjh9I3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is "too perfect" a nice way of saying boring or not enough of a challenge?	I have been told by a number of women who I am friends with and that I have dated that I am too perfect for them.  I go back and forth on what that means.  Sometimes I suspect that means I am not enough of a challenge.      I admit I am a very organized person, who got good grades in college and now in law school, I am very considerate of my female friends and I care about my appearance.  Maybe this coupled with my lack of vices like drinking and smoking do make me boring.        Basically do women not like men who have it together as one of my friends describe my situation?

20090203000713AAjABs0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies::How to ward of strange men and stalkers?	Strange men seem to always find me wherever I go. I had an incident last week where I was walking in the bike lane to get to a friend's house, and this man yells "Hey" out of the window then proceeds to speed up and block my walking direction. I was so annoyed, because I had to walk passed his car to get to the sidewalk. I snap at him "Dude, you are blocking my way!" He goes "Well I thought you were going to Ypsilanti", (a near by city). Why the hell would you or could you think I was going to a particular city when you don't know anything about me. I'm like, "No, I'm not and where I am going is none of your business!". He proceeds to tell me how he can give me a ride, for like 5-7 minutes then finally gives up and leaves.      This happens to me all the time. Men are always trying to pick me up if I am walking. Or always approaching me where ever I go. It's so annoying. My mom says I am too friendly and I need to look meaner LOL. Any tips?
20090202224709AA0UveV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What can I do to get my ex-boyfriend back when he won't even talk to me?	My boyfriend broke up with me a week and a half ago. And I am so upset because things were going so well between us. We've broken up before but we got back together agreeing that we still loved each other too much to be apart. Then when he broke up with me just recently he said he was confused. He said we could still hook up but that's it. So I called him a couple days ago because we were supposed to see each other over the weekend. And I asked him if he still wanted to hook up, his reply seemed like a "wow ur a joke" kind of no. So now I'm suspecting he might have another girl. But if he does, I know for a fact that it's another girl that lives in another state. So I don't understand how that would work. And I just don't get it, he's acting like he's moving on, but at the same time, when he saw me with another guy, he came up to me and was like who's that? and I was like just a friend, and he was like "you sure know how to pick them". I know that was sarcasm, but I don't get why he would even do that. Other than that conversation, he won't give me the time of day, won't talk to me at all and is dead silent to me. But I just really want to know how to get him to talk to me, at least be friends, and if possible how to get him back.
20090203002952AA34zRZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I think about cheating on my husband?	We've been married 20+ years. I love him but he is very, very hard to love. He is critical, judgmental, negative. He doesn't make me happy but when I find ways to make myself happy, he takes them away. No matter how much I give him, inspire him, teach him he still wants to be a jerk who always sees the downside and he has to rub my face in it.      If I have a really good friend, he points out all her faults and how she f***ed up her life. If I have something I love doing, he tells me how pointless it is (eg gardening, painting, writing). If it doesn't make money, why do it? He is basically a greedy pessimist!      I've posted here about my situation and other places as well. People always say to leave him. I know they are right. I've known it for a long, long time. He is not the "right one". I made a big mistake. He will never change.      I have gotten depressed and self-destructive. I don't sleep well, eat well and sometimes I drink to cope. More and more, actually. I have been to counselling alone and with him. He changes a little bit for a little while but just when things get bearable, he slips back to his old ways - little by little and we are back into old patterns. I start to get strong but he wears me down - little by little he chips away at everything that matters to me, everything I need to be happy, everything I enjoy is "silly" and so I come down deeper and deeper.      I know he's not going to change. Now I am finding that the only hopeful, positive thought for my future is to wonder what it might be like to be with a man who I could share feeling good about something and have him just share my joy instead of wiping the smile off my face.      Is this really such a bad thought? Maybe believing that such a man exists is a step towards getting the strength and hope I need to leave my husband?

20060625073952AALGNkR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ladies, would you befriend a woman who's more attractive than you?	How come it's hard for ladies to befriend other women who's more attractive than them? I am female and average looking and I have trouble befriending women who are more attractive than me. And most of us have this paranoia that they're going to steal our husbands/boyfriends (if you've seen the movie "Malena" you'll know what I'm talking about).       And if you are an attractive woman, do you or don't you have a lot of female friends?

20090203013511AAYhbXS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for the ladies?	I know most girls like tall dudes but I was just wondering if there are girls who are actually attracted to a guy that's short, like myself. I'm 5'6" on a good day, lol. All my friends are tall and find dates easily. I'm not taller than my friend's but I'm way more muscular and athletic looking I'm a amature boxer and played point guard for basketball (made the team even though I'm short, yay!) It's like if my friend or I went for the same girl, he would always win, he's 6'2". Or if we're with a group all chilling, the girls always paid more attention to him. I'm not going to lie, I'm somewhat jealous, is this bad? He's been with way more girls than I have, he's white and I'm asian, I don't know if that has do do with anything. Thanx in advance!

20090202213008AANLGiB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do women always date jerks?	Why do most women like jackasses?  Seriously, they always go for the guys who mistreat them, whether it be physically, emotionally, or otherwise.  She will start to date a guy, even when he disrespects her from the start.  Then, during the relationship, she puts up with it all, he can call her horrible things, ignore her, scream at her, lie to her, hide things, and even cheat on her.  And what does she do?  NOTHING.  She whines to her friends and family about how he's "such a jerk", when she's the idiot who keeps taking him back and putting up with all his bull crap.  When her friends tell her that she deserves so much better, she says "I know." but doesn't do anything about it.  When they try to tell her that she should just LEAVE him, she says "Oh you don't understand, I can't, I love him too much, he's just such an amazing person!" and stays with him despite the fact that she's being mistreated.  Sorry but if a guy treats you like that, he is just that... a guy, not a man.  And sorry but that's not love.  He does not love you if he does those things to you, if he treats you with such disrespect, he's not a "great guy", he's an ***.  Why are women like this?  It's stupid.  I wonder if it's because ever since we are little kids, that's the mentality that we are given.  "When boys are mean to you, it means they like you".  If you're a little girl and you're playing in the sandbox and a boy comes up and pushes you down, you go crying to your mom, sister, or whoever, and what do they tell you?  "Oh that just means he likes you!"   It's really not a smart idea to teach your kid that if a boy hits her and calls her names, that it means he likes her.  Ever since we are little girls we are told that if a boy is mean to you, if he calls you names, or pinches you, or hits you, that it meas that he likes you.  Why would we think any different when we're older, if that's what we're taught as children?  We need to stop telling our kids that and just tell them the truth, "that kid's a jerk so don't play with him".  Quit trying to sugar-coat the truth.           What are your theories/ideas on this?

20090203005932AA2DBK1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Rage or what gives with him?	I have been with my fiancee for 2 years now and though I love him I have a strange vibe about him. So he is very sensitive about everything and he does communicate well about how he feels and believe me that is great BUT....he very often asks me whats wrong and what the matter is with me, no matter what I say he keeps pushing and pushing and no matter how many times I say nothing its never good enough. That gets old after a while, also he gets angry very fast and raises his voice just as quick. He gets VERY angry very fast. We spend Christmas with his parents and while there we had 2 huge fights because I asked him to spend some time with me as well (he was in the garage with his dad building a race car about 20 hours a day) I mean he was YELLING at the top of his lungs and when I told he I was upset at how he acted it was even worse. Now mind you I am away from him right now because I am training for a job and we will be apart for 3 months. He seems to get angry more and more frequent now that we are engaged. He shakes and his face just looks so angry. Now he will say he is sorry when he is wrong. Mind you he is 31 and I 37 what is his deal. Then he turns around and tells me nothing will ever come between us what gives

20090202202859AASOI4T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm not sure whether to believe in my boyfriend?	We were best friends before we started going out 4 months ago. The transition took place around my birthday. My friends planned a surprise birthday party, & one of my friends, A was in charge of inviting him as a surprise guest coz they knew i really like him & we've been meeting up every week. After the birthday weekend, other friend told me that the guy (my boyfriend now) & A were txting each other. I assumed it was just to settle my birthday dinner plan. Well, last week, the topic came up while i was chatting with my boyfriend (we're in a LDR right now, i'll get back soon). And he admitted that they did txt each other. What hurts me is that he txted her to ask what she was up to. He said that he txted her to get to know me better, but when i asked for him to tell me what was it that he asked her to get to know me, he couldnt think of anything specific-just said that it was generic. We didnt talk for a week, then yesterday I found out another thing...I found out he txted her after my birthday dinner & that was when we started going out. He said he txted her to keep in touch & to ask if there were any more fancy celebration for my birthday. And now im confused coz firstly, he told me before he txted her to get to know me better but now he said to keep in touch? & then, at first he said he only txted her before my birthday dinner when we werent going out, but now he said that they txted after my birthday dinner as well? And the cheek of him, getting mad at me coz i got mad!    The thing is, this 'friend' of mine, found him cute, thinks i'm lucky to have him, CHEATED on her boyfriend! And the girl had the nerve to take pictures of back/side of his head & posted on a social networking site. I can get if she's being a hoe & txt him first, but he txted her first as well..    Theres more to the story, but that's the gist, i guess.     I am so confused, i don't know what to do. I really love my boyfriend, & i've always been afraid of feeling betrayed by him but now i feel like i'm betrayed. What do you think?

He keeps telling me to come up and move there, but when I seriously start talking money he tells me to stay and keep working because I'll need twice as much as I've saved up to drive down there.       So now it seems like a more distant dream and I don't know if I want to move a million miles away to rehash what was at most a bad relationship.      He was on MSN tonight, and so was I -- He didn't say anything to me all night.  I usually have to start the conversations, I wondered if he would do it on his own.       There is a girl named Mijana there and she has been slutting around with him... When I bring her up and try to say something bad, he defends her... thats telling me that he cares... Is that correct?         Should I go? and risk it? or stay and be lonely and pseudo sucidal.  (joke.)
20090202215129AA9Xz8p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I tell if a girl's giving me her number because she's interested (please answer)?	Recently I've been having a lot of success getting numbers from girls. But I don't know if they're giving me their number because they want to be just friends or more than friends. Most of the girls I get numbers from are either friends of friends or old co-workers (and a few random approaches thrown in). And I think a few of them may even have boyfriends (though I'm not sure). Thanks for any insight.

20090202214748AAftmUB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My fork in the road. Can you help me decide? sorry kinda long?	Ok I don't know why I am doing this on yahoo. But maybe just for reassurance. Well here's the deal. I am a junior in high school and my girlfriend is a senior. She is planning to go to a jc that's like 2 hours away from me. And for the last 4 years I have been planning to go to a different state and life with my dad and go to a jc up there. My parents got divorced a while ago. But the thing is that I really love this girl. Idon't know how into she is to me exactly. But if what she says is true it might happen. I am thinking about this now because I want to let my dad know ahead of time. And I don't know what to do. This is my first girlfriend. She was the first girl not to turn me down and ironically she is the hottest. And I don't know if I can find another girl like her. I know she truly loves me because I am not exactly the prettiest guy out there. I have really bad back acne lol and shes not even phased by it. And lets just say so far in our relationship I happily made it home several times. I honeslty wouldnt mind staying with this girl for the remainder of my life.       option 1    Go to the other state like planed and go to the JC up there and leave my girl behind. Up there my step mom can hook me a intern job at a school and I can live cheaply with my family. I been wanting to do that for a long time but now I am questioning myself if thats what I really want anymore.      option 2 I can stay here and go to my girlfriends JC when I graduate. The problem would be funds. I dont know if I will be able pay my college off with the appartments and whatnot. I know I can get through the work fine and stuff. I just dont know if I should do it. We have only been going out for 4 months but it feels a lot longer than that.      I guess its like should I do what would be good for school as in easliy be able to pay it off. And life with my dad.      Or should I stay here and be with my love. I dont know. I want to ask her how far she will go with me but its too soon. The worst thing to happen is if she broke up with me and I end up waisting apart of my life.      please help. Sorry for the story but I wanted to add a backstory.

20090202234810AAc4xyL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this just jealousy....?	I went to see one of my friends up North a few miles away to celebrate New Years and got to know this guy that lived up there. We got on great all night and by the time I had to leave he blurted out how he felt about me and asked me to come and see him again soon.   I agreed and since then we've been texting and phoning eachother back and fourth.   About a week ago though a friend rang up and told me that he has a daughter! He's only 19 and the fact he kept it so quiet bugged me...I asked him about it and he said he was worried about scaring me off and losing me. Well since then our texts have got less and less, the distance and the fact that he has a daughter has pushed me away quite a bit, I'm only 17 after all and I doubt I'm old enough to help bring up someone else's child.   I looked on his facebook though and saw hes been chatting up some other girl :( For some reason now I can't stop thinking about him and I really don't know how I feel, could this be something serious or am I just jealous?   He sent me a text at one in the morning last night saying:   "I know we've stopped talking but I just want you to know that I still miss you! You're the most amazing and beautiful girl I know :) Sleep well hun, ly xxx"   Why chat up some other girl and then say "ly" to me?! I'm so confused :(      If you have any insights on this then please let me know   Sorry about how long this is      Thanks x

20090202205454AAzAMYZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does my girlfriend lie to me about smoking?	My girlfriend use to smoke. She quit almost two years ago because I came into her life and was a better influence then what she had before. She realized it was for her own good and was really glad about doing it. Now she is at a job where there are many more negative influences and now she is back to smoking and partying on weekends. She tried to hide it from me but I found out and I wouldn't care that she wanted to, but the fact that I asked her about ten times and she said no each time pissed me off a little. I didn't yell and scream though, I'm a passive person and I just went for a walk and cooled down myself. Once again she said she would quit but I caught her smoking again tonight. Why is she doing this, and doesn't she know she's losing my trust? Please help if you've had a similar situation.

20090202213028AAUiLoK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you do about someone you can't say 'no' to?	There's a guy I'm friends with who I have a bit of a crush on. He's a really funny guy, but he can also be a bit of a jerk. Everyone is used to him being a bit arogant and mean, so we all laugh it off.    The problem is I have trouble saying no when he asks me to do things for him. I know he's just being lazy when he asks me to walk to the coke machine 3 meters away and get him a drink, but I can't help doing it. It's a little humiliating because I would usually just laugh if someone asked me something that stupid, but with him I can't.   Why am I acting this way and how can I stop acting like his slave?      P.S. this is not about questioning our friendhip, appart from being lazy he's a very nice guy.

20090202204017AA82TRX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need anyones advice, best guy friend. . .?	My best guy friend loves me (like more than a friend).  We've been together for 6 years but not dating, just friends.  I have been liking him more than a friend for about 6 months.     He got a girlfriend.     My best girl friend told me that he said everytime I'm with her, all he will think about is me.  He didn't want to ruin our relationship because he didn't know how I felt.     I hang out with him more than he does with his gf.  She is a 9th grader and we are both juniors.   It breaks my heart when I hear people ask if the girl is his gf.  One night I bawled because we are so ment to be.  What should I tell him?  His relationship with her is nothing because he can only see her at school.  I want to say something, but I don't know what.   Please give me your advise.   I appreciate it very much.

20090202220725AA6bxic	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I do anything wrong here?	I just transferred to a 4 year college and live on campus. I met a girl that I vaguely knew from my hometown and I think she's gorgeous. She's single. One day she came over our dormitory and was just hanging outside and people got me to come out and chat with her. I stupidly brought up her high school days where she had this goth phase and she got very upset and stupid me I kept laughing about it. So I asked for an apology via facebook since she wasn't around for me to say sorry. She accepted the apology and a couple days later at a party we were talking to each other and joking around. The chemistry seemed like... on/off, but on her part and everyone tells me she's a bit shy. The whole party as I danced with other girls and played pong her and her friend would be talking and glancing over at me.      So I asked her out via facebook since I didn't see her again, to a night of bowling at the local alley and it's been two days she hasn't gotten back to me with a response. And everyone keeps pressuring me to talk to her and ask her out, etc... one of my buddies said we have similar personalities and we would make a good couple... and they know her better than I do... I don't know what's going on, did she blow me off? Is she super-shy? Even if she was dreadful of society, she wouldn't likely ignore a facebook message. What did I do wrong here?

20090202231354AAsqSve	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Virgin guy needs help...serious responses only please! ?	No matter how I present this question it paints me in a poor light, so I'm just going to do my best. I'm not some kind of perv, I'm just an average Joe 26 yeard old guy. Previously for religious reasons, I've never had sex or been sexually active. But as I've become more detached from organized religion, I feel comfortable with moving to a new stage in my life. Needless to say, I know that moment will be coming soon, and I want to be prepared for it. Please give me any tips, ideas, or things no one told you that you wish you would have known before your first time. I'm mostly worried about the etiquette involved that I may be ignorant to, rather then the mechanics of it all (all though I definetely wont turn away suggestion that way either). This is obviously foreign territory for me. A little perspective from both sexes would be appreciated! Thanks to those with honest responses seeking to help!

20090202231232AAmmbcz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why won't he talk to me?	I'm 14 years-old, and I have a friend named... Jim. Yeah, let's call him Jim. Anyway, Jim and I are flirty, we talk a lot, we sit by each other at lunch, etc.  I found out that he had a monster crush on me, so I obviously was really stoked (since I liked him too). But I don't date. My philosophy is that dating is for when you're past middle school and on your way to being an adult, I want to like my life as a kid while I still am one. You know?  I said that in an email survey that I forwarded to Jim and many others. (In the survey, you release everything you've been dying to say about your friends, but you don't say their names.) I also said in the survey that i liked him too.  Jim replied to the email, and said that he respected me, and wanted to stay friends.  Now he won't talk to me, but he talks a LOT about me to his friends. Good things! He makes up stories about us hanging out and being all "buddy buddy". Why is he doing this? Why won't he just talk to me and have some REAL stories to share?  GAH.
20090203002108AAnVxM2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls how would you like to be comforted...?	I just saw a question whether a girl likes a strong sensitive guy who will comfort her when she's upset...   My question is that if you get upset, how would you like a guy to treat you. Should he try to coax you to talk, or should he just hold you in his arms and silently comfort you. I'd like to know in case I am ever in this position...   Thanks...

We went to the same school. The thing is we never went on a date in High School. But then we ended up at the same University and had 2 classes together. So we got to see each other every single day of the week and walked to class together every day or after class we walked to the library together. We got to know each other a lot more than we used too. But when the Semester ended I moved to a different collage that was closer to home so I don't get to see her anymore. We talk to each other at least twice a week or more. Every time we talk se says that she misses me and and that collage is not the same since i've been gone.

20090203024643AAwwsWk	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why am I so obsessed with sex with my wife?	We have been married for 12 years and have 2 kids 8 & 10.  I am 40 and she is 47.  Our sex life was never very exciting and she always seemed to avoid it.  There were excuses and rules and headaches forever.  I used to believe the excuses but now the kids are older and I see that all the excuses were... who knows?        We are finally going to counseling but I don't see where it's headed.  It feels like my wife just wants to keep delaying until one day i wake up and i don't care anymore.  That might happen, but when my libido goes down, does she really want me to have so many bad memories of rejection?      Does anyone else feel like this?  Some of my friends say I am over-reacting.  Why am I so obsessed with having sex with my wife?

20090202220530AAGEucJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So there's this guy i like...?	ok, well he's been in my class for 2 years but we didn't really talk much until about halfway through the second year, and even then we were never really close or anything.    so a while ago i started liking him but at just then one of my friends also liked him. and he liked her too. they went out for a while but nothing ever came from it, her parents said she couldn't have a boyfriend, and they were pretty good friends beforehand and didn't want to break the friendship.       that was a fair while ago and i was in and out of liking him but when we came back for the beginning of this term every time we looked at each other he smiled and today when i was walking to the bus stop he come up behind me and pulled me back by my bag (like in a joking way) and we started talking. one of my other friends has known i liked him for a week or so and keeps trying to get me to ask him out.      what i want to know is do you think he likes me or is he friendly?   what should i do?
20090203015456AAwhN5T	Family & Relationships;Family	Why is he so annoyed? Is it pride?	I work with this man, we used to be good friends but feelings developed and our friendship got awkward. Basically, I thought he was more into another woman and he did seem caught between us, so I wouldn't entertain him, despite the fact he claimed they were just friends. However, he was uncomfortable if the three of us were at a social do together, so.....Anyway, it seemed to me that when I tried to be friends with him again, he was cold. He came around then and we were getting on great, but just then, he turned cold again. So I have kept my distance, I have been polite etc, but don't go out of my way to engage him in chat etc. Thing is, THIS is pissing him off. The fact that I don't make an effort to be friends seems to be making things worse, in the sense that he now barely says hello back to me even on the odd occasions that we bump into each other during the day. I dunno, is he trying to make us more distant by doing this, or is he annoyed that I won't make an effort so is paying me back? Also, if I look well, he avoids me like the plague, makes a point of looking away or pretending that he can't see me (so I'll see him doing it, even other people have noticed this and this is a guy whose entire interaction with women is based on flirtation and compliments) BUT if I look casual, he will bouyantly say hello and it is like old times. What gives?

20090202203116AANrVhl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really need advice, should I let it go now before I get hurt or give him the benefit of the doubt?	Okay, so here it goes. Relationships are complicated right? How do you know if it's worh the effort? I'll just give you a little synopsis of the **** I've had to deal with SO FAR. Okay so we both got out of year long relationships 3-4 months ago and we're both afraid to get hurt and everything but we liked eachother a lot and everything goes smooth and steady we are in the pre-dating stage and I wouldn't have sex with him then la la la 2 weeks later- he asks me to be his girlfriend and I have sex with him...then he goes out to dinner with his ex the next day (whom he said he has known for forever and is just friends with and wouldn't date again). Then the very next day he has "second thoughts" on dating me. I asked him point blank if it was about her- he said it wasn't. Then he tells me he's going to date her when she moves back into the state (which is why they broke up in the first place-long distance) 5 months from now and would I just let things go back to the way they were and be okay with that? So, I get pissed say we can't have anything. Then I decided I'm moving in 5 months anyways so it's a good thing. So I decide to tell him I changed my mind and he says he and his ex had a fight he told her about me and she got back with her bf and it's going fine until he says he wants to date me...I get upset and just ignore it. Then later I bring it up and he says he was kidding. Now, is it just me or WTF?! Now what I want to know is: Is he using me or is this guy just incredibly confused?

20090202205229AAYUzNa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm 18 and in college...the girl I like is 16. Any help would be so much appreciated?	I don't really know her that well since I don't see her very often at all, but we recently became facebook friends and have sent each other a total of two private messages back and forth.      However, she is 16 and a Christian, which on the surface doesn't seem like it would be appropriate for me to really turn up the flirting meter. I mean, I'm not normally nervous with girls, but I don't want to seem like a creep or anything. That's why I am somewhat reluctant to keep exchanging messages, and to really switch to flirt mode.      Please, any help would be much appreciated. This girl is so wonderful and carefree and I love her smile. This is driving me absolutely crazy night and day.

I've been going out with a girl for a very long time but I don't like her I went out with her as a favor for a friend. the valentine's day banquet is coming the 12 and another girl asked me to go with her and I said yes. Later on I told my girlfriend and she is really sad and said I can go with the girl as long as I tell her that I have a girlfriend and who my girlfriend is. Due to the fact that I don't like her I told her and all her friends to keep it a secret from my school. My school only has 82 students so anything anyone does spreads like wildfire but lucky our relationship hasn't because everyone that knows I have to to keep quiet about it and miraclously they have. The girl I'm going with is really cool and fun and I don't want to ruin any feelings we have by telling her I have a girl and there is no possible way we can go out now...I need to find a way to break neither of the girls hearts. I can't break up with my gf and I can't call of the banquet because the girl would feel bad and my girl would suspect something......help.

I pick fights, etc with him because of this. Im thinking about breaking up with him because im not sure if i can deal with his large amount of female friends for the rest of our relationship? he thinks its cool if he and just a girl hang out too.

Ive tried to accept this for a while, but im having a lot of trouble. besides this girl thing, i would not change a single thing about him. he's devoted and sweet!

We've talked for hours on end at school (6 was the longest talk-a-thon), he's blown off studying and assignments to hang out with me, he's invited me to half-a-dozen things, and at a party at his house, he convinced me I had still had too much to drink to drive home and sat with me for a few hours while I worked it out of my system.      Yet now I'm feeling as though he's backing off, because I haven't kissed him or really made a "final" move. Is it slutty to just kiss a guy, or after all he's done, is it logical for me to make the first really definite move?

I want to  know her better, but I have some problems.  First I have some kind of an accent, since I came from Mexico to the U.S. when I was eleven years old and my teacher didn't do a great good teaching me English.  I'm also kind of shy, which means I spent most of my time alone.  I don't have any friends on my myspace page, although I do have friend but they go to another school.   Anyhow I want to know if inviting her to be in my myspace page would be the solution to my problem.  Please answer my question carefully and if you can give me some advice.

20090202222242AALaLhN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	To any women... please explain what I did wrong. I know it's long but I REALLY need some help here.?	Please explain what I've done wrong in this situation. My girlfriend of 1 and a half years just left me. I know it was soon, but I loved her, and I could tell she was the one I wanted to spend forever with. I was always there for her, I gave her everything she wanted, and I tried harder with her than I've ever tried with anyone. We've had our ups and downs, but we here happy... well, at least I was. While we were dating, she cheated on me, but I loved her so much I let it go and gave her another chance. She cheated on me AGAIN but swore to me that she'd never do it again. I was very reluctant to believe her but I loved her so much, I decided to give her one more chance. About 4 months after that (about a month and a half ago), I asked for her hand in marriage, and she said yes.      Now's the part where I did something wrong, but cannot seem to figure out what. She told me that while she was with me she was beginning to have interest in other guys. I told her it was natural to have interest in other guys and as long as she doesn't act on her interest then everything would be ok. She told me thank you and the conversation ended. Over the next few weeks, she thought about it more and more, until the point where last night, after promising me her hand in marriage, she breaks up with me, and tells me that she hasn't been with a lot of guys and wants to know what that experience is like, to say that she's been with a good number of people before she settles down. I begged her to stay, and told her that I could do things differently, but she kept saying it was her doing, nothing I did, and that there was nothing I could do because she was doing what she felt was right. She also told me, after discovering that I was heartbroken that it's important to give up your wants to make the other person happy, yet I did something so wrong that she disregarded everything I needed for her "fun time" with other guys.      I doubt her and I will ever be together again, but I know I did something wrong, and I'd like to know what it was... I really don't want to make the same mistake or mistakes again.      And, to those of you who read all this and bothered to answer, thank you so very much, it is highly appreciated, more than you know. God bless you.
20090202222620AA0lR9a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I being too harsh with him?	I've been really annoyed with my boyfriend because he tells me to come over all the time, yet he'll hang out with his friends and say "I'll be there in 1hr" and he'll arrive in two. Or he'll say "I'm leaving now" and arrive in an hour (he and I both know that wherever he is, it doesn't take an hour to get back). I hate when people are late and when they don't call while running late and especially when they say they're coming, when they know they're not. My boyfriend has apologized constantly and asked me what it is I want him to do or what he's doing wrong to change it. The thing is, I'm upset that it's a mistake he keeps making, and to me, that means he's not making a conscious effort to change it, which means that he's not respecting my time. Sometimes, I just get the idea that he doesn't care. Sometimes though, even though I get angry with him, in retrospect, I feel as though he just doesn't understand what he's doing wrong. But even though I get the feeling that he really is oblivious and isn't trying to keep me waiting, it still makes me angry because I would assume he'd get it by now (this has happened about three or four times).       I've discussed this with him and told him exactly what I think - that it shows he doesn't care about my time, or getting there in time to see me (because there could be times where it gets too late and I won't be able to come over). He apologizes repeatedly and gets upset and sometimes mad that I think that, and when I leave I consider that might be being too harsh, but what do you think?

20090202234630AA9oSeL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend is having a baby with his ex girlfriend. How do I deal, should I stay or let him go?	First and foremost, my boyfriend and his girlfriend were completely broken up when she dropped the news. I met my boyfriend in June of 2008, she told him in late August.       Im home, while he's at the hospital awaiting the birth of his little girl. I love my boyfriend with everything I have. We were dating about one month and he found out his ex gf of only 4 months was pregnant. She went pretty crazy on him a few months into it (after she finally grew enough courage to tell him). She waited until after 3 months to tell him she was preg. I decided I would take the risk. He's sworn up and down he'll NEVER be with her. He's spent a lot of time with her lately, but if he wasn't concerned it would say a lot of his character in a negative way. He wants to wait a couple months, and we'll be fine - get engaged.   The past month has had it's emotional ups and downs, the mother of the child was diagnosed with precampsia with only a few weeks to go, which was very stressful on my boyfriend and her as well. We've spent a lot of time together, we've always been so connected and inseperable... I want to marry him, and he's promised a beautiful life together. I know his daughter will be number one, i want to be in her life as well... but I feel that he doesn't have enough room in his heart for our relationship, he loves me there is no doubt. However, his mother doesn't approve of our relationship, and the ex has accepted it and boldly stated "As long as OUR daughter always comes first"... The only obstacle is his mother now ( my boyfriend is 33), which family is important, i want her acceptance but she will not give us a chance. He says everything will be better than it ever was a few months after the baby is born... I understand the tremendous amount of stress he's under, the last month he seems like another person. I'm only human and deep down I am scared he'll see that baby in the mothers arms and fall for her... He knows my worries, I do not voice them that often, that is too much for him at this point. I'm very honest, and always have been. I've been as supportive as I can... Will I be on the back- burner indefinitely? Should i stick it out and be patient like i have been the last 7 months.... or am I simply wasting my time on a lost cause?
20090202234939AANIGg8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I read lots of books & articles on dating tips.  what would my GF think if she knew?	You know the "self help" section in the book store? the section that sells Dr. Phil type books?  i read those books.      i noticed that nobody looks in this section at the book store, because ppl are scared to admit that they have mental issues.   (kind of like buying condoms in public.)   i find these books very fascinating and they helped me a lot in making connections with people.      but what if my girlfriend knew that i read these things? Would she hate me for depending on outsiders' directions to keep my relationships alive? or would she be impressed at how much i'm trying to keep a relationship with her?

20090203012429AAB8pDh	Family & Relationships;Family	Would this annoy you too if a kid did this?	My b/f and I went over to his brothers house to watch the superbowl this year. I had a stressful day at work in the first place, and I just wanted to relax. Well my b/f's brother has only one daughter, and she doesn't have anyone to play with. She wanted me to play with her, which I did for a bit, but I then went back to watch the game. After that, she wasn't the center of attention, and started bugging both me and my b/f. She continued to bother me by pulling my hair and hitting my head while sitting on the couch. All while this is happening, her stupid parents did nothing to get her to stop, and I was getting incredibly pissed, but didn't say anything since she obviously is not my kid ( I really couldn't do anything). Since I got annoyed with what she was doing, my b/f's brother said to my b/f later that i'm not good with kids, and that I wouldn't make a good mother.       I would like to know if you would get pissed if a kid was continuously poking and hitting you, and their parents did nothing about it also. In my own personal opinion, my b/f's brother and his wife spoil their daughter rotten, and let her get away with just about anything.

20090203010543AANXURt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is our friendship worth the risk?	I have been close friends with this girl since I was a junior in high school. Even when I moved away for college, we remained close. I remember it was about the middle of my junior year when I started having very strong feelings for her. I tried ask her out, but failed. We agreed at the time our friendship wasn't worth risking with a relationship and I swallowed my feelings and tried to move on. nearly 5 years have passed now and the feelings have yet to subside. I have dated someone since then, but that relationship fell apart, yet the feelings I had for her remained. I am at the point in my life right now where I am ready to start taking major risks in my life. Normally I would just live with what I am comfortable with, but I am slowly starting to do things Im not used to. I am really starting to believe that I need to tell her that, essentially, "no is not enough" and that I want to give us a shot. However, I am not sure how to approach her about it in the best way. She just recently broke up with a guy she really liked, but he really mistreated her, much as her previous ex did, so I know I need to give her time, but I don't want to wait so long that she finds someone new and I, again, am left to these feelings that remain unresolved.      I guess this really comes down to a few things: 1) How do I approach her about it to present the way I feel in the best possible way so that she understands where I am coming from? 2) If she says no, should I just accept it and leave it or should I keep pushing it? I've had these feelings long enough to know that they are more than just a crush, otherwise I wouldnt be in this position. 3) If I really do feel as strongly about her as I like to think I do, is pursuing her to give me a chance worth potentially tarnishing our close friendship? I know us both well enough to know that even if it weren't to work out, there's no way we couldn't be friends, but I, nor anyone, could say 100% for sure. Even so, is she worth it?      I know this kind of question is subjective and you all don't know me, the girl or the situation in depth, but I come seeking some answers to help me make an educated decision, one that I can feel strongly about.      thanks

20090203013149AAcokC6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My best friend started ignoring me after she got a boy friend. What should I do? ?	We promised each other that we would never let any guy mess up our friendship but that's what is kind of happening right now. She's spending a lot of time with him and it seems like she really doesn't want to spend time with me. I don't know how to talk to her about this.
20090203013245AARcNTE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does this girl want me to do?	So there is this girl in my life that seems to be always out of my reach. don't take me the wrong way but she seems to always seek me out when she finds herself in trouble. example; both times she has become pregnant she tells me and asks me for help after kidnapping me for a couple of days. I've only asked her out once almost a year ago. she also is going out with a good friend of mine who is notorious for making his girlfriend's believe he is the ONE. he is the one who got her pregnant the second time, and i don't think he really is into her.         But this last time was different. She called me and told me she was being followed and that she wanted to sleep at my house. then changing her mind I ended up going over to her house for the next four nights. over this time period she starts(night I came over) by flirting with me and then we go to bed shortly after I come over.  I had a strong feeling that she really wanted to have sex with me. Note this is the first time in the last year I've been hanging out with her she has let me sleep in the same bed. next morning she wakes me up flirtatiously by jumping on the bed. later we pick up a friend to chill for a wile. this is when it starts getting weird. she completely ignores me and flirts madly with this dude. over the next three days she continues to ignore me with everybody we hang out with. On the second day however we ended up getting into a six hour conversation talking about her current relationship and our past relationships. you know really opening up with each other.      well finally i left and i feel as though I'm the one who ****** up and that i missed my chance just one more time.      one note: on the last day today, i was really into my thoughts (from this roller coaster of confusion) when she asks me if i was feeling alright, and if i wanted a hug.      thanks for what ever help comes this way, i really appreciate it.
20090203013707AATjOP5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If she's been sleeping in my bed...?	does that mean she likes me? Its an odd situation.

What is she thinking, does she want to be with me?

He has all the qualities I want for honesty, loyalty, dependable, loving, kind, good to my kids etc. However, I am not the head over heels attracted in love with him like I was when I met my ex husband.

Does that stuff (wild attraction/in love) only happen when you are young and carefree? Somedays, I am attracted to him more than others, and somedays there is just nothing going on..... We are both getting older, aging, do not have the youthful look as much and I work full time, single mom with two kids & very tired Should I give him up to look for this feeling I had in my 20's?

20060710010447AAkNXP6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do guys come in here and try to spit game?	They come in here asking if women will have sex with them or anything dumb of that nature. What's the matter, can't get laid anywhere in your hemisphere so you ask thousands of miles away if you're hot? Ugly is universal. If your ugly in California, you're ugly in Uttica, New York. You know there's no one on here within an hour away from your house, so why do you do it? If you're that pathetic, I live next to an adult toystore, send me $39.95 plus $4.95 s&h and I'll be glad to send you a bow up doll.

And from 6th to 8th grade he would talk to me alot. He would always say that he hates me. And i would always tell him that i hated him too. But in 8th grade i asked him why he hated me and he asked me the same question, I would tell him that i didn't hate him. But he would insist that i hated him. Well he was a really annoying person. Lets just say we flirted alot. I would always tell him to stop talking to me, Because we would always get in trouble for talking to much. Even the teacher was suprised that we were the only ones talking all the time during class.I would tell him to stop talking to me, but he wouldn't listen to me, he would still talk to me, and we would always get in trouble. and i was the only girl he would do this to. Anyways since 9th grade up to now which were both going to 11th grade we haven't spoken at all. Even when we pass each other in the hallways. He wouldn't even say hi or anything. What should i do to get him to ta       Additional Details      7 minutes ago   What should i do to get him to talk to him again. Last year i asked one of my friends to give me his msn address and he was on. and she told him that i wanted his address and he said that he didn't want me to have anything of his. What should i do i really want to flirt with him again because i miss talking to him. He is the only guy in my class that i don't get along with and don't talk to.

20060730131413AAJF8eV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you believe that divorce rates are increasing because of imagrants trying to become citizens by marriage?

So if they did so after the alotted time, then they can get divorced.  So do you believe that is why the divorce rate has increased?

20061129181228AAYnAEo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So I like this one guy but he's in an unhappy relationship...?	So I like this guy, but he's dating this girl who's been asking him out on and off for the past year. I'm pretty sure he's only dating her to get rid of her because he hardly ever talks to her or anything and she doesn't really talk to him. One of their friends told me that they want to break up, but neither will do it.   Everyone keeps telling me to forget about him, but lately I just can't seem to get him out of my head. I had a crush on him about six months ago and he turned me down, but now we can actually carry on conversations and the like, but I'm afraid that if I tell him how I feel he'll tell my ex who's one of his friends and he'll discourage this guy from dating me.   Should I talk to him, or forget about it? I think I can get rid of the gf, but I don't know what to do!!!   Help!! Please!!

It's like...when a guy hits 18 they're usually over the whole "omg she like him and he likes her!!!!!!!!" and crap like that.  My friend's not....I kind of am (i act beyond my age adults say...) So this guy wasn't worrying about her thinking she likes him or thinks he likes her cause like i said he's beyond that.  so he was grabbing her hand and squeezing it and then they were having an interesting conversation...laughing blah blah. no big deal i've had tons.  she thinks they had a moment...o and i almost forgot---we've been a bit icolated in a private school untill this school yr that hasn't started yet and we never really has a guy friend so u eaither love them or u hate them is they way we went in the school.

Pessoal, na verdade, tenho uma certeza.Só gostaria de confirmá-la, pois de repente posso estar sendo mto radical.Terminei com meu ex, e depois de um tempo ele arrumou outra.Me procurou mto mas eu n?o cedia, ent?o ele ficou com ela.Depois de 1 semana, nos encontramos e ficamos juntos.Foi aí q ele me contou q tava c ela, mas disse que me ama e quer ficar comigo, disse q terminaria c ela.No outro dia, sumiu, fiquei sabendo q bebeu demais, e tal, sem ela, nem eu.Depois de 2 dias, arrumei as malas, vim embora e, qdo chego aqui, um email dele, dizendo q me ama, q é pra eu voltar, q a outra foi um erro. Eu respondi q estava machucada e precisava de 1 tempo,assim como ele. Ok... Ontem, nos encontramos no MSN, e nos falamos por tel. Ele disse q me ama, mas q ainda está com ela, pois ? quer sofrer se ficar sozinho.Bom, eu acho estranho demais. Acho que, se ele tá ficando ainda é pq ele quer a outra, mesmo me dizendo q n?o. Ou será que estou errada?Ele afirma q me ama e pra eu voltar. E aí???

20060902041822AAupmZ5	Family & Relationships;Family	Why is my mother so controlling of me and and has feelings of jealousy?	My whole life my mother has been a mild mental case ( seriously) she is fully functioning and non medicated but definitely has some emotional issues in my opinion. For example she is extremely jealous if anyone comes before her ( other than my husband) i think. MY grandmother, a cool aunt with whom she is very competitive with I have great relationships with and she is SOOO envious its ridiculous. Most recently I asked her for photos and a death certificate of my biological father who's grave I would like to visit. I am 42 years old and she has never given these or discussed them with me. NOW she wants to have this emotional dramatic meeting to present these items to me as opposed to just putting them in the mail. She is always trying to keep control of me in this way by keeping the DRAMA alive and well. she is even jealous of the fact my college age daughter was homesick and missing me. I was never that way in fact could not WAIT to get out of the house and away from her! Why ? Help!

20060906193938AA77UXL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dating advice.?	I had a friend who just got married 4 weeks ago. I met this girl who turned out to be my friends cousin who just graduated high school and was leaving for college in a week. We danced and talked for a while and she gave me her #. We hung out together for a little bit that night, went to see a movie a few days before she left, and I just took her to a concert when she came home a few weeks ago. We talk pretty much everyday either by text message and on the phone and we really seem to have a lot in common.  There is only one thing....I am 24 years old and she is 18 about to turn 19.  She has said she likes me and I have told her I like her as well but she is young and only a Freshman in college. I think there may be a chance in the future to have a realtionship with this girl.  Right now though I really don't think she is looking to get involved while she is away at school. Am I reading this girl all wrong or is there something there where this girl could be more than just a friend?

Both of us are completely confused by the situation because we feel like there is a thin line between what's the right thing to do and what isn't.

Estuve dos a?os y medio de novia con el padre de mi hija, pero eso terminó. A los cuatro meses de empezar nuestro noviazgo, quedé embarazada. Yo segui trabajando, pero él nunca hacía nada. No me animaba a terminarlo antes porque pensaba que la nena iba a sentirse mal. El tema es que yo siempre trabajé, y estudié, lo sigo haciendo, y él nunca tuvo un trabajo en el cual durara mas de un mes. El único que tuvo fue uno, y lo echaron. Cuando pude finalmente terminar esa relación, al tiempo volví a tener una pareja: mi hija lo adora, y él a ella, sin dejar de tener muy en claro quien es el padre, y yo jamas le hablare mal de el ni querre suplantarlo, sea como fuere: ?debo sentirme mal por seguir con mi vida?

20061009085345AAtGbex	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What shud i do? Let her be, or confront her?	I went with a girl to homecoming last weekend and everything seemed to go very well. Yeserday, while talking to her friends, who by the waqy are really cool and i highly doubt they would lie to me about it, found out that she has been saying **** behind my back and that she dislikes me. Before i blow up, let me say this: I am and honor student and captain of the school swim team. She is not very athletically, socially, and aceademically inclined (to put into nicer words). So basically, I went out with a loser. Before askeing her to homecoming, i went in wiht an open mind thinking that she could be a really cool person if i got to know her. During the time before, during, and sfter the dance, I was reall, really nice to her. I gave her my jacket when she was cold, i was really sweet, and i helped her with things. I also defended her when my friends made fun of her. Her friends think that she is very stupid for doing this, cuz they think im the best she ever gonna get. What shud i do?

20061030014920AARS8xl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	O.K. so here is what happened?	I met the most beautiful girl of my dreams, I took her out on three or four dates, wined and dined this goddess from Thailand. Six foot with legs from heaven and a chest so large she should not be physically able to stand up. She finally invited me back to her place for "coffee". After a while she asks me to kneel down infront of her and close my eyes as she gets undressed as she is a little shy. I figured what the heck why not? I kneel down eyeing her legs up and down feeling myself getting hard, painfully so. I close my eyes hear her panting. After about 5 minutes I feel this warm fluid sqirt on my face and her laughter, I was so shocked I opened my eyes and looked right at her hard "ding dong" pointing right in my face. OMG she is a he!!! I opened my mouth to yell and accidently tasted it as s/he *** on me.  I was too shocked to even move. I can still taste it and hear his/her laughter. Anybody else been with a ladyboy before by mistake? AHHHH I need a shower!!!

20061101132712AAooqah	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Two problems with friends and guys?	Okay first, my friend is going out with this guy a grade ahead of us and he really likes her. She likes him she's just not "obsessed." Today, she told us (her friends) that she was going to break up with him. But then, someone told her what he'd previously said, which was "I hope she never breaks up with me, I really love her." Now she always has this confused look on her face like she doesn't know what to do. Any advice?      And secondly, I just started going out with this guy today, he's a grade below us, and I sort of like him. It all kind of started when he sat with us girls at lunch. My friends were trying to get him to say something that I had no clue about. He finally told them that he wanted to ask me out. They came and told me and I didn't know what to do. So I told my friends to tell him yes for now, so I had time to think about it. I do like him. It's just weird. I don't know what to do now, whether I should stay with him or not. I like him a lot but it's embarrassing. HELP!!

I said ok. On friday i saw him 5 times that day and he didnt come up to me once. I was in my freinds car with her and her mom she was driving her to the doctor. My friend told me that he was staring at me. He sped up in his car so that he was at the same stop sihn that we were at he kept on staring at me.

20061115213011AAlJ1m8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Unrequited love, what do i do?	ive been in love with my closest girl friend since i met her 3 yrs ago.  At first, i didnt know her too well but for some reason i was attracted to her a lot.  She's not a typical girl that cares so much about her looks, its the emotional connection that i fell in love with.   The thing is that, last year i told her that i loved her with all my heart.  She said she had to think about it and after a week or so, she rejected me (kindly) but it was the single worst feeling i have ever felt in my life.   We grew so close as we opened up to each other and we talk about everything and anything.  I have never felt so close to someone as i do to her.  Ive had crushes and i know that this is NOT at all a crush.  I would have been over her in a week or at the most a month but for some reason i cant get over her.     I, being my dumb self couldnt take the pain and asked her not once but two times after the 1st time she said no(same answer).  We are still really close friends but everyday it hurts
20061117093907AAA5W7f	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relacion con 2 chicas...?	Tengo novia desde hace 5 a?os y nunca hemos tenido ninguna ri?a grabe, nos llevamos muy bien y se nota el amor.      Hace cosa de 2 semanas conoci (por internet) a otra chica, tambien guapa, parecida a mi novia en cuanto a cari?osa y divertida. Solo que esta tiene unos gustos sexuales mas parecidos a los mios que a los de mi novia.      El problema que tengo es que con mi novia llevo muchos a?os y tenemos planes de futuro hechos. Esta otra chica me gusta un poco mas que mi novia, pero no me da nada, es mas si me liara con ella lo mas probable seria que incluso mis amigos me dejaran de lado (somos un grupo peque?o), se me desestabilizaria la vida laboral (es un poco largo de contar) y no se si llegaria a olvidar a mi novia.      Con esta chica nueva no e tenido ningun tipo de relacion sexual, ni nos hemos llegado a ver en la realidad (si que nos hemos intercambiado fotos, se que es ella porque la fui a ver donde trabaja).      Hemos kedado en seguir conociendonos.      Que creis que debo hacer?

Si hace cosas que él no acostumbra hacer con nadie más y es diferente conmigo pero no avanza en ningún sentido y algunas veces llega a ser grosero o cortante, pero otras es muy amable y educado(sobre todo en privado), que creen que signifique? Cuando le dije que me gustaba (a 1/2 pasillo algo lleno, pero nadie se entero) el 1° se sacó de onda y luego como si nada hubiera pasado y seguimos igual que antes, pero yo quiero avanzar y no seguir igual. Que creen que debo hacer? A veces parece que hay posibilidades y otras se comporta como si no quisiera nada conmigo. Ayuda pl

20090202095037AA6WCi2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship help? Am I dumb or what?	I just got out of a pretty long relationship.  So did a good friend of mine.  We started to hang out all the time, but I kept telling myself that we were just friends and that nothing more would ever be there.  The only problem is, each day more and more i find myself wanting to be his girlfriend.  I know in my heart that I am completely over my ex boyfriend, i broke up with him and i have absolutly no feelings for him.  The guy i'm interested in tells me the same things.  However, I have seen all the mush emails he used to write to his girlfriend about how they were going to get married and how he would always love her.  I know things change, because that changed in my old relationship.  But, do you think he could have really moved on?  It's just so hard when those emails are so deep.  I don't know if i should just give up trying or believe that he really is over her.  Am I crazy to think that he could be over a 3 year relationship in a month?
20090202094211AA84Sf6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When do you think he will call?	My BF and I have been split up for a week.  God I miss him!!

In the 1.5 years that we were together, we never went a day without talking. I'm sure he misses me too???      I won't call him again. I just wanted to call him to get that off my chest, just in case he thought otherwise.  Now I feel better. And if he doesn't call me back, it just wasn't meant to be.  But how long do you thknk it will take?  A couple days? A week?

20070302201940AA43zTB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	?Porqué a veces nos es díficil aceptar lo que somos?	Bueno, hombres y mujeres tenemos defectos y virtudes. Sin embargo, la mayoría de veces vivimos de las apariencias ya que nos importa mucho de que diran las demás personas de ti. Por lo cual, personas que son muy lindas o/y bellas sacan provecho para captar la atención de los demás y ser mas popular. Por otro lado, hay personas que no soy muy lindas o feas que no son muy agraciadas con sus apariencia y a veces les cuesta aceptar lo que es en realidad. A veces uno tiene que aceptar lo que es ya que no lo puede cambiar su apariencia o lo que uno es en realidad. A veces pensamos porque no nacimos perfectos, pero en realidad nadie puede llegar a la perfeccion. Hay que luchar por lo que uno es y seguir adelante.

No lo creo tan descarado, o sea creo que tiene cabeza!   Fue muy insistente en salir, pero no entendo si como cita o que!

Si la pareja no tiene nada comprado en común, ni hijos, ni absolutamente nada que se puedan reclamar, on line está muy bien y económico.   Si existen bienes en común o hijos, lo mejor es visitar un abogado especializado, de modo que solo a traves del propio convenio se solucionen las posibles divergencias que pueden existir.   Muchas veces un convenio muy general o poco específico puede dar lugar a posteriores y costosas acciones para solucionar el problema de ahí que las entrevistas con su abogado sabien qué se hará le dará esa tranquilidad y seguridad que merece.    http://www.bufeteblazquezros.com

Now he has to call me and badmouth a girl who's name he does not even know!?!?!?! I told him I haven't spent ANY money on her because SHE is not like that. She is really sweet and kind, LTR material and he has no right to call and bad mouth my girlfriend whom he doesn't even know under the guise of caring for me and my well being. He says that he wasn't elluding to anything and is just a concerned father. BS!!! a father would think "hmmm I don't even know this girl, I have no reason to be concerned and in fact if I knew her I would see that she is different than other girls".      WTF is wrong with him? Did I do the right thing?

Y la verdad es que yo pensaba que todo estaba bien con el a pesar de todo esto. Pero entre a un empleo nuevo y conoci a un chavo que cuando lo veo siento algo en el estomago, igual cuando me ve, me toca o escucho su nombre, me pongo muy nerviosa, me ha invitado a salir y la paso super genial con el, tenemos mucho en comun y eso me gusta mucho, me encanta estar con el y cada vez pienso mas y mas en el.

20070615204112AAwg9Zs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I cut my loses or just wait?	I meant a guy on a personals site.  We finally got an opportunity to IM Wednesday night  and actually ended up on the phone where we talked for hours.  He seemed to like me and I think he is nice. Well the next morning I texted him and told him how I had a great time talking to him and he texted me back the same.. also saying that he couldn't wait to call that night.  Well I waited and ended up texting him a couple of hours before he had to go to work (He works overnights as a nurse).  He said he was going to call right before leaving, but the call never came.  I happened to be online twice earlier today and said hello and both times he waited and then signed off.  I decided not to text, IM or even call him again because I am getting the feeling that he is not interested or is playing games.  When we spoke, he said he was interested and didn't want to play games.  I am the type of person who cuts people out of my life if I feel that I am being lied to.What should I do wait or move on?
