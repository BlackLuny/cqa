gBKcBKuaaa	I dont know where you live, but in United States Maryland they only have one year of warranty. But otherwise if you warraty is still intact then yeah you can get it fixed for free. the thing is you have to either call xbox (1800-4my-xbox) or go to xbox.com and get a box shipped to your house to get it fixed. the thing that sucks is that it takes about 3 months or so to get another xbox back. Yeah thats right they dont give you your exact xbox back, they'll give you the same model, but it was one that was broken a while ago that they just fixed, they do this to ensure the fastest returnal of your xbox which so far is failing in timed response, but if you decide to get another xbox in a replacement under warranty, take off you face-plate to you xbox and any other things that you have on it, make it look like as it came out of the xbox box but without a faceplate. Also dont send in your cables, games, controllers or anything they will not send it back, just send the gaming system (xbox 360). The E74 error when you start up your xbox is basically the ring of death(when your 360 is completely destroyed in some way. If you cant send it in or get it to a shop where you have to pay for the fix, the take the initiative, and take it apart and find the graphics card and have heatsink on it (you can buy at radioshack). Heatsink makes it where the heat can escape more easily and is very cheap and easy to do) look up a tutorial for it if you gunna do that. Microsoft didnt put good heatsink in teir xbox they make you do it yourself(WARNING TAKING APART YOUR XBOX WILL VOID YOU WARANTY)|`|4EN1srnVaa	Usually the warrantys are only a year. but idk. i had the same problem and had mine for a year in a half and its warranty was gone. and it cost me 99 dollars. but you should try unpluging your harddrive laying the xbox on a wood surface and leave it for a day and then try it without the harddrive. thats what my friend did and it worked

Hk8iSHLEaa	bearshare,the  pirate bay|`|Q0dzzgomaa	I would suggest that instead of downloading from Rhapsody, Napster or Limewire, you use the Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter from www.dvdvideosoft.com for the following reasons:    1) Sharing  - With limewire, they want you to share the songs you download and the songs you have. Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours siftingthrough thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)    2) Preview before you play  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well.     3) Virus Risks  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for.     4) Settings  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:  - Install  - Select the folder  - Select the quality  - Download your songs    5) Wider Variety of Music  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can.       Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:    Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:    Pros:  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.    2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading    3) No viruses.    4) Preview before you play    Cons:  n/a      Limewire:  Pros:  - You can download free music    Cons:  - Everything else    Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com|`|3iE6dHjDaa	Frostwire, BearShare, imesh, Spiral Frog,

DOG9Vfjmaa	bring it to the store and see what they say
UOz1LPIHaa	I doubt it.  The thing's still selling quite nicely, so there's no reason to mess with the formula yet.    Besides, that would almost certainly increase the cost due to higher processing requirements for all those extra pixels.  Nintendo's plan has always been to keep costs down so it's affordable and reasonable for the non-hardcore audience. . . and going HD just doesn't fit that model.  If you want HD, you're probably liking the game selection on other consoles better anyhow.|`|HmAYw6W5aa	no it's just a rumor.|`|ca1o8Ylsaa	No it was just a rumor and it still needs time before the wii can be replace from another Nintendo console.And it won't be call wii.|`|2fbde007751b53153f91de150f61ac5caa	No, because it isn't real.    There's usually around 5 years between Nintendo consoles.    Since the Wii came out in 2006, don't expect a new console before 2011.  And don't expect it to be called Wii either.

BMSlTn51aa	Well $250 may not be a bad place to start.  Nextel only lets people upgrade at the cheap prices once every two years, regardless of where they are at in their contract.  So, if someone just signed up for nextel a few months ago and went with the free phone then, and now wants that fancier phone, they are looking at retail price for a new phone (which is $449.99 for the i870, though it's recently been discontinued, around the 9th of Jan.)

I think you could probably get more.|`|AA11288552	I just got a i870 in Nov last yr of eBay and i got it for around $200 and it was in perfect condition except a couple minor scratches and a 256MB SD card so i guess the same $$ around the $225 and have a reserve of at least $200(unless you plan on selling it with a better SD card or none at all, the phone usually comes with a 32mb card at least all the new ones i have seen) i assure you it will sell probably in that range.|`|47d244d62e953f06f3f23fd44440a3bcaa	have an auction but put a reserve for $250

4bca983bb61ba43835565073f00542e2aa	Just keep playing dude.  I was like you a few months ago, now I an beat the game on expert.  You might try putting it on hyper mode and try the faster speed before you move up to a higher difficulty.  At the main menu put in orange, blue, orange, yellow, orange, blue, orange, yellow.    That will activate it and deactivate it.  Try that out to get a feel for the fast speeds, About the Oranges in the harder difficulty levels, try and get them and soon enough it won't be so awkward moving your  hand.  Just keep playing and it will become familiar.|`|aeb191e55af6a15a39067a4bc8fe50d6aa	try doing it really fast what you have learned so far but first do it slow and get to going faster and faster without making mistakes until you master that part then after you have practiced enough to be a great medium player move on to the next step and do the same thing with the difficult part.then you will be a guitar hero

AA11471050	i just bought mine saturday & i love it! it's very cool and modern looking, has cool ringtones, and i love the blue-ish color and that it's curvy. <br>  it is kinda girly, so if you're a girl, you'd probably like it.<br>  the only thing i wish it had was a camera. and i wish i could download ringtones onto it. <br>  but overall, it's a good investment. i'd recomment it to anybody. :]

AA11705521	Ebay and Craigslist are two great places to get Sprint Phones without a contract, also you can go to an indirect or dealer store and they will most likely have phones for sale that are inexpensive.  Lastly you can always go to www.sellyoularphoneco.com and get a refurbished phone with little out of pocket expense and again no contract.  The one thing you should add to your account once you get your phone is the handset insurance, although the $5.00 and $50.00 deductible are a pain you can get a replacement phone in 2 - 3 business days.  <br>  Good luck|`|06841afc5ad8a6e96fc2b3f451974494aa	You can try ebay.  Also, I have changed companies and had sprint.  I have an almost new red LG flip phone that I just use now for my alarm clock.  I love it and wish I could use it with Cricket (my new company - you might want to see if they are in your area yet.  $45 a month for unlimited calls, texts, pics, etc.  ($55/month includes tax and everything) No contracts.  Prepaid but they bill monthly and you can pay the bill on the web just like other companies. Check them out at www.mycricket.com and check coverage)  If you are interested in my phone, you can email me.  Maybe we can work out a fair deal.|`|e8b71105ce0186681d858502eb746fb2aa	You can't buy the phone without a contract.

AbRfd29Haa	No, SACD is SACD... there's no other name for it. I found your player here:   http://www2.panasonic.com/consumer-elect...    And no, no SACD or DVD-Audio playback mentioned. Unfortunately, those formats set off a format war for high definiton audio that pretty much ensured neither format caught on.     You're more like to find SACD support in Sony or Philips players, as they were the major proponents of SACD. I do believe the Sony PS3 handles SACD discs (and I may have to verify this by tracking down "Dark Side of Moon"... that was the very first CD I bought, after replacing the LP, twice).     I had originally considered the DMP-BD50 when I went Blu-Ray shopping, but at the time (last June) they were still delayed in getting it out, and the PS3 just seemed like a better deal (at around $100, at least back then, with support for more formats, as well as games, though that wasn't my primary concern).

qWicVoU9aa	The repeaters may be a little pricey at first but they are worth it.  The call center I work in did not have any service in the building for the first 2 years I worked there and then they put a repeater on the roof and now we have full signal and phones work great anywhere in the building, which is pretty good considering it is a metal building.  And by the way, AT&T does not guarantee in building coverage and it is in their contract so that is not grounds to cancel the contract as someone else suggested.|`|fOd8Rzqfaa	DUDE JUST GO OUTSIDE|`|JzYlcuXzaa	I would suggest calling your wireless provider and telling them you would like to cancel your contract.  You won't be charged the cancellation fee due to the fact that you're area is not receiving good signal (juice it up a bit) and it will give you the opportunity to check the other major carriers in your area who can provide better service.

XL76XolNaa	I got the Ipod touch the Christmas it came out and I love it. I can't go anywhere with out it.   To answer question  1: I would get a minimum of a 16gig memory or bigger depending on how many movies and videos you want to put on it in addition to music and apps (note: One standard movie takes about 1 gig of memory, a longer one like Harry Potter or a movie around 3 hours will take about a gig and 1/2.)      2 I haven't heard anything about a 3rd gen with a camera and I'm generally pretty up on that stuff. You can never be up on technology and there will always be new stuff so if you want one buy it. Besides I'm sure you have a camera on your cell phone so It's not really that big of a deal.      3 The iPod touch is defiantly worth the money. I'm always on mine and are constantly downloading apps and music. It's great especially if you travel a lot since you'd be able to download music on the go (just tap into WiFi.) I would be very hesitant about buying of ebay because you don't necessarily know where it has been and even though the seller may say it's never been open, they might have resealed it themselves. I would buy it from BestBuy (which is now an authorized seller of all Mac products instead of somewhere like Walmart and Target who sell almost all MP3 players.) Not to mention if you do by from ebay and the seller Jailbroke it (removing locked applications and modifying the device) and if something goes wrong Apple WILL NOT fix it. It's safest just to buy directly from apple or best buy.     Hope This Helps|`|djBMmP3Taa	omg! yes you should! i have one its A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! and its worth the price, you should get the 32gb,if the 3rd gen ipod touch might going to have a camera hmm maybe...,|`|ueAq1Bmsaa	Well ask yourself if you really need it.  If you already have an Ipod stay with that. :]  You should save your money for something else.  If the ipod with the camera is coming out soon maybe save the money  to get that one.
SQyVBEIwaa	No, you cannot get backgrounds for 2nd generation iPod Nanos.    I have one and their aren't many features you can put onto these iPods.  You cannot download iPod games for it either.    The only things you can put on the nanos are music/audio and photos, which you store in a photo album.

The pac is only if you like to watch music videos and video clips, but with the pac you pay to have it and you have to pay and download the videos, well not all of them but most of the videos cost, there are some free ones tho.

0AqkCOWIaa	I have the D40, and i love it. I do not have the D50, that is a pretty old camera. The d40 produces really sharp images. I do not see the D40 being a whole lot better than the D50 in image quality. I do not think ( i may be wrong ) that Nikon is still producing the D50, so you can probably get it for a Great price, if you can find a really good lens on the side to go with it, i don't see a problem in getting the D50. Both would be good cameras. Like the person above me said, you do get a few more quirky features on the D50. Hunt for a used body in good condition, and a good lens.|`|tWoN22rRaa	The guts of these two cameras are very similar. What it comes down to basically is features. The D50, despite being the predecessor to the D40, is a more equipped camera. Most importantly it possesses a built in motor, which allows it to autofocus with all Nikon AF lenses (not just AF-I and AF-S like the D40).

Ur6H8gwkaa	Your camera doesn't have a RAW mode.    Even if you can hack it somehow, there is a possibilty that photo software won't even recognize it as a standard RAW file that matches a particular camera.    The advantages of RAW are huge although it isn't always needed.  That's why some photographers shoot in RAW+jpeg. You can use the good jpegs, and only get into the RAW files when you need to.    RAW files are huge, and they take a long time to open, edit and save compared to jpegs. However, they are the closest thing to the RAW image right off the image sensor as you can get. The dynamic range is greater, gradients are finer, color gamut is wider etc.     You have a lot more leeway with white balance, no compression artifacts like jpegs and so much more. RAW files can save you when shooting tough high dynamic range pics or with white balance problems, things tha can't always be fixed with a jpeg.      All dSLRs can shoot RAW, and some top of the line (expensive) point and shoots support RAW.|`|k7MINvaIaa	You can download this set of hack tools for your camera. One of the *many* functions thus unleashed is the ability to save in RAW format. Very much worth playing with.    http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/SX100IS|`|pZGLhV2Waa	RAW format is all the information gathered by the sensor. It is not processes in anyway. Where as Jpeg files have sharpening, contrast, saturation, white balance and color correction applied to them in the camera. Jpeg files are also compressed. The advantage of RAW files is that it gives you much more latitude in editing the photos. If you are serious about the quality of your photos you would shoot in RAW. The disadvantages of shooting in RAW is that every photograph needs to processed and then saved as either a Tiff file or Jpeg. Also the file sizes are much larger than Jpegs.    RAW is not available with your camera. The only Canon point and shoots which you can shoot in RAW format are the G9 and G10

If you have phone insurance, I think the phone will cost you $50, that's what it costs me.  If anything, the Go phones in the electronic section of Walmart are pretty nice, too.  You don't have to use them as go phones, u just put your chip in from your other phone and it works like a normal phone.  Verizon makes some go phones and Cingular does too.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Did you take out insurance on the phone?    If you didn't then you'll have to pay for a new phone, I dropped mine a few years ago, and had to buy a new one, now I have insurance, its only $5.00/mo.

If it is then you're fine. If it isn't then when you synch your iPod you might lose all your music.

Also sometimes you music is saved as individual files on you hard drive and you can just transfer them into your new iTunes.|`|VHxgY45jaa	No...that happened to me before, there deleted from the computer, but not from your ipod.|`|0Jkp4qitaa	No... that would be unfair of Apple!  And the songs on your iPod-it's not always connected to your computer, so even if your computer did/does delete them, having them on the iPod will let you get them back.|`|7vF1fIsRaa	Well it will most likely be gone from itunes when u reinstall it, but all of your music, videos, etc., will still be saved on your computer.  just go to file and add file to library.  Choose all u r songs and what not, and they will be added to your library.  they wont be deleted off of ur ipod.  Just dont sync ur ipod with ur library until all of the songs are back in it.  Then you can sync ur ipod again.  but no matter what, ur songs will still be on your ipod unless u sync ur ipod without putting the files back in itunes.  hope i helped

Once you've recorded and edited the tracks in Audacity, you should Export them as an uncompressed audio file - usually a WAV file - don't use the "Save" option. Then use a program like Windows Media Player or iTunes to burn the songs to the CD.

sXgRJ0PKaa	Cellphones connects to a cellular network of base stations (small boxes with a lot of wires that you see around your neighbourhood) which interconnected to the public switched telephone network. Technically cellphone and mobile phones are different to each other as mobile phones can be either salelite and pre-cellular phones.|`|748e52896f7538a3cba8d811c3112b59aa	Radio waves|`|e2620355e6dfa30ad06594c0cbfd3648aa	satellites|`|3c6837390f3fc66ff4f839269ffcfb95aa	nice question|`|bxIT7SLRaa	Here is how it works.  You dial the phone number and hit send on your phone.  your phone accesses the tower serving the greatest signal for your carrier.  That tower runs authentication on the information sent from your device  to determine whether the device is actually who it says it is. Once the information passes authentication at the tower, the tower passes the information to a Mobile Switching Center. The MSC will process the information and it's destination before sending the information to the Local Telephone Company.  From there the Local Telephone Company will pass the information along to the correct area, before the it gets passed back to the wireless side, through another Mobile Switching Center.  From the Receiving MSC, the information once again will be passed out to the cell tower that is giving the best service to the receiving phone and then it gets passed to the phone, along with the sender information.|`|f69d6224f6f34d309d7fb2da81ad7f6aaa	The cell phone sends a signal the nearest cell phone tower, that usually goes through land telephone wires to the tower nearest the other cell phone tower.

yDJiiqcsaa	I have "rescued" several from a "watery death" (but recognize that you shouldn't do this if still under warranty because disassembling it will void the warranty).  Take off the back cover and use jeweler's screwdrivers to remove the "guts" from the case.  If you have access to compressed air - gently blow out the moisture.  Reassemble and get battery back in there soon.|`|JgTNtT9Uaa	Switch it off immediately.  Take out sim and battery and remove any changeable covers it may have. Stand it upright on a piece of kitchen roll, or tissue. Blow with a hair dryer on medium heat then place over a radiator (medium heat) over night. Have saved many like this,   Vik|`|o2xP8s1caa	i heard if you put it in rice it will absorb all the water but idk|`|AangDWFdaa	my phone was "swimming" once in the sink for couple second - well i used the hair dryer , o dryed for about 5 minut and later again .|`|VhjmWAEDaa	take out the battery, wrap the cell phone in a thick rag and out it in the dryer for two 5 minute intervals, wait like 5 minutes in between|`|3bcbc8b9c682810a2f5f771d643ffef8aa	The only thing that might save it would to completely dissasemble the phone screw by screw and blow dry it to evaporate all the moisture. Even this may not work if it's already affected the circuits. Sometimes water damaged phones will work for months before crashing since any left over moisture will start to corrode the circuits - it looks like a chalky blue/green substance. But really, if you're screen is already out it's probably too late for you phone. Hope you have insurance.

S7L1o8HIaa	If you buy it new, it would have the latest version before it was made. There is a mobile WiFi app store on your iPod, you just need billing info and then you buy it and it is put directly on it. If you are buying apps on your PC or Mac, then you click "Buy App" and then it is directly sent to your library. Then you connect the iPod to iTunes and choose which bought apps you want to sync (or put onto.) It is okay, It took me a while to get this figured out when I got mine.

0AqkCOWIaa	I would personally recommend The Canon. It features live view ( which is great for learning how to use Manual exposure ), and it has more AF points, which you may/may not find needed. Both have self-cleaning sensors, and ten megapixels ( or there about ). I think you should get the Canon, you get a few more features as a bonus. Both cameras would produce identical images.|`|3mAgM405aa	Neither of these DSLRs have built-into-the-body image stabilization and the auxiliary image stabilized lenses are not cheap.  And should you want to take videos with sound, there is no such capability.    Here's a better alternative which will provide you with a full range of photographic options.    If you are really on a budget and want the best quality for the money, check out the P&S Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 [with a Leica lense] which has more features than most pro DSLRs that require auxiliary lenses not even equal to the single initial full-range lense that comes with the FZ28. It is reviewed at:    http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...    It just came out on November 4, 2008.    It's an all-in-one 10.1 megapixel digital camera which includes (i) built-in image stabilization; (ii) HD720 quality video [Quicktime] which permits zooming while videoing; (iii) a 18x zoom [27 - 486 mm (35mm equiv.)] "Leica" lense for nature photography; (iv) up to 0.39 inch macro option; (v) up to 6400 ASA; (vi) takes up to 380 pictures per 120 min. battery charge; (vii) has a "burst speed" of 13 fps; and sells new for $315 at amazon.com.    Here's an actual handheld picture of the moon:    http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/...    If you can take a handheld picture of the moon with an 18X zoom, concert coverage should be a breeze.    Good luck!

Soo.....u should be able to...but u will need to make sure that it has pretty full signal if u are gunna use your neighbor's wireless..|`|BMConIedaa	So you want to know if you can use just a Wifi card for your PC as a wireless access point?    No, the Wii does not support "Ad-hoc" wireless networks.  You must be using either a Router (an "infrastructure" wireless network), or you can get the official Nintendo USB Wifi adapter for your computer (which as been discontinued by Nintendo, but you can still find one if you look hard enough).    The router you mentioned has 4 ethernet ports for wired network connections.  If your PC has an ethernet adapter, then you can use both your PC and your Wii with it, and both can be online at the same time.  If you decide to get the USB Wifi adapter, then your PC must be on for your Wii to go online.    A Router is not "basically a wifi adapter."  It is a stand-alone device that allows several computers to network with each other.  A broadband router adds the feature of sharing your internet connection with all connected devices.  The router you listed is not just for Laptops.  It is for all devices with an ethernet plug or a Wifi adapter.|`|oWwPSBV4aa	This same thing hap pend to my friend and then me and my dad gave her a Router....Okay like what hap pend with heir's was that she was using her neighbor's wireless without them knowing because they didn't have a password on it, but then when she went to the wii she clicked the right one and everything...it was just because that i only have 1 bar and it wasn't a strong enough signal.

j5Apt8hWaa	I bought a P&S camera that had been refurbished and I have had it for over three years and it is still working just fine.   The camera cost just under $50 and listed for over $200.    You may or may not know this .. if the camera was refurbished by the camera manufacturer, it is as good as new, but with only a 90 factory warranty, yet most sellers will give you a "free" one year warranty issued by them.|`|NZxvybYUaa	I was told by a Canon insider (reliable 100%) that most of the "refurbs" sold by canon are cameras that were taken off the assembly line at random, batteries and memory card installed, and tested for 50-100 shots, for quality control. If they pass, they can't be sold as "new", because they've been used. So they go to the "refurb" shop to be used as replacements for warranty units. After they accumulate a stock of refurbs, they sell them in lots to distributors at discounted prices, with reduced warranty terms. I'd guess that most manufacturers have a similar program.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Refurbished means it was returned to the factory for one reason or another. Sometimes no reason at all. People often return something just because they changed their mind. Sometimes the item was defective and then sent back for repair. That camera place has been in business a long time. It may or may not be good.

Q9saUFYqaa	I have a PS3 and it's great. I also like 360, but would choose PS3 because of the better graphics, free online, and blu-ray capabilities. Xbox obviously has a wider assortment of games and the online probably works better, but PS3 still tops it.|`|vNY3uN1Zaa	I would have to go with a PS3 if i was you=)|`|Ps3kMSFyaa	I seriously think both systems are pretty cool. both are around the same price when you add everything you would need since you have to pay for live but the ps3 is higher. ive played an xbox ALOT and i seriously love it. but im getting a ps3 instead because i like the games on it better. its up to you. if you like gears and halo, etc, get a 360, and make sure you get what your friends have so you can play with them. or get a ps3 if you want more memory and games like resistance and killzone 2. just take a little time out and think of what best suits you. :)|`|mmnK4mGmaa	Both are very similar, most popular games are on both consoles, also the graphics are also nearly identical, but the ps3 may be slightly and i mean slightly better, but sometimes it depends on the game.  In terms of size, i feel that the ps3 looks quite abit chunkier than the xbox, however the ps3 has the feature to play blu ray movies, whereas the xbox cant, so this may sway ur decision, but depends if u will be using this feature or not.|`|SRK9y7V2aa	The person that says the loading is slow is an idiot, it depends on what game you're playing. Some of the games install a lot on the hard drive which means it loads a lot faster than the 360. The Ps3 has better graphics due to the blue ray feature but what're graphics compared to gameplay. 360 has a wider variety of games to choose from which may impact on your decision. Also the ability to expand your hard drive on your ps3 is a fantastic feature i have all my music and videos on there and i'm eagerly awaiting play tv so i can record onto my hard drive. My opinion would have to be the ps3 due to the ability to customise without voiding warranty and the quick loading times.|`|n0dbwJnmaa	That is an opinion based question, neither is better than the other, both have different games, I personally have an Xbox360 and love it, but I haven't played on a PS3, but have heard they load pretty slow with all the HD and blu-ray. Pretty much up to you to decide, have a look on www.gameplay.co.uk and see which games you like most out of Xbox360 and PS3, and go for whichever you like, thats what I'd do.|`|pOi0wewIaa	PS3|`|zLIusnTKaa	PS3.    better graphics, no glitches, FREE online play.

Xxviy63Paa	Redesign the whole thing completely. Unfortunately, since it took so long to develop into the lame form it's in now, Sony would never gamble on an overhaul that would likely take another year or two, they would just pull the plug. They should kill it now, but they have to save face so they'll keep it.    The basic problem with Home is that it's all set up to be like a social scene, like a copy of Second Life. The problem is that people who play Second Life are mostly not the kind of people who use ps3's. They're people who mostly like to just hang out and chat with each other. The percentage of girls on Second Life is relatively high, just like it is for games like the Sims.    Playstation Home is almost entirely dudes, and the vast majority of people there aren't interested in hanging out and chatting with each other. Nobody really cares about the repertoire of emoti-gestures you can make your avatar do. There are some pervs who will try to block you into a corner and make their emoti-gestures look obscene, that's about it.     What ps3 users want to do mostly, is go online and FIGHT. Not talk. Or at least be involved in some kind of role-playing story. What's the fun in going into the theater, sitting down, and then watching the movie when it looks just the same as it would if you just download it to the XMB? It only takes longer to do, that's all.     Most ps3 users don't get a kick out of having an avatar that can go do things in a 3-d environment, because we've already been doing that for years. And we're used to having more things to do than talk to a bunch of strangers, or pretend to play pool or bowl. We can jump, make elaborate combo attacks, aim and shoot 3 different targets in the head within seconds. We can jump into vehicles and planes and drive and fly them expertly. We have already used headsets for years, and in situations where there was something to talk about. Besides "hey the weather is great in the plaza today" or "what new stuff can you go waste your money on in the Mall."    So basically to improve Home they need to make it into a big gameworld. Big, like miles on a side. And make different areas where you can go and fight. Let clans build castles where they can hang out. Right now Home is just the Sims with real people, marketed mostly to guys but designed for girls. It sucks and deserves the scorn it has been getting.    I still use ps3 exclusively among consoles, but I can't abide Home. It is a complete waste.|`|3AChQgbZaa	i like the way its headed now.  the only thiing i can think of is more activities but those are steadily coming so...

If the lenses are roughly the same price no one would be able to tell the difference in the photographs. Not even a lab.     Now if you bring into the mix third party lenses like Sigma or Tamron. Canon and Nikon would beat them almost every time.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	They are close to being equal. But I'm a Nikon man..

Go to the system section of My Xbox to enable this.|`|vp1JASiTaa	It will pause, however you can enable background downloading in settings. Go to system settings, click shut down, and within that menu there will be something that says background downloading disabled. Simply enable it and it will continue downloading when the system is turned off. It is shocking how many people have no idea this feature exists.|`|3Zeg6dcQaa	in setting it says when you download something and turn off your xbox your ganna see your downlaod in the demo or arcade|`|UlxEqoi5aa	It Will Pause It.

Daern917aa	Well if you have an HDTV, you should get an HDMI cable and get the best graphics. I have Call of Duty 4 and World at War, I personally prefer W@W because I am into WWII and history. They are first person shooters, and the controls are pretty easy to get used to, I would recommend playing through campaign so you know how to play and don't get owned online :P.    If you're looking for an RPG game, I would recommend GTA IV, the gameplay is different than the previous series, but it is amazing, the sounds, graphics and the engine it's running on. The first part is boring, but aren't most games like that? Once you go further into the story, it's amazing!|`|d381leKpaa	If you can, wait. The PS3 is having a $100 price drop, in April, 2 months away! I'm waiting till then to get mine, but anyways, here are some games that i've heard about and looked up...  Killzone 2, amazing graffics, and supposedly good online play.  Resistance 2, looks amazing aswell.  Little Big Planet seems like a good game for everyone, other pple have recomended it to me to buy once i get mine.  NHL 09, i've played that one, it's the best game EVER!  Uncharted Drakes Fortune, a bit short but should have good replay value (from what i've heard)    All these games can be looked up on www.gametrailers.com or www.ign.com|`|VcNHahtgaa	Shooters:  Resistance: Fall of Man  Resistance 2  Call of Duty 4  Call of Duty: World at War [I recommend 4 though]    Adventure:  Uncharted [Best graphic game out there, 10x better than Tomb Raider]  Tomb Raider      Also for Shooter, Killzone 2 will be coming up next month and it looks amazing. So far rated an average of  95 from 13 reviewers which is really good. You should get it, lots of PS3 owners will.    Also, Uncharted 2 is coming out this fall, watch out for that game, it will be better than the first.|`|c790c5c635b1c7325a0a335574c230eaaa	I normally don't like adventure games but I enjoyed  -Metal Gear Solid 4    Killzone 2 will be coming out soon about a month and is looking good.    Resistance 1,2 are fun. I've only played 2 as a beta so i really can talk about it. The first one is really hard so you need your skillz on that one.    Mirrors Edge is an excellent game but really isn't a shooter.    Should also look into games like The Orange box for Half-Life 2 and one of my favorite games Portal.    F.E.A.R. has a good story but i liked it better on PC. And the Second F.E.A.R. should be coming out soon.|`|L3aCgcbxaa	Check out COD 4&5, also GTA 4, and Overlord    Assassins Creed is OK, but gets boring, maybe rent that one

raFYuWouaa	it sounds to me like it's your digital connection and not the amp you may want to replace the coaxial or optical cables. try your fm stereo to see if it plays the radio in all speakers if not it is your final output capacitors in your amp this is a serviceable problem and all is not lost.   Good luck|`|ORgTnV82aa	Amplifiers won't "short out" instantly. If you have screw-tightened terminals and you put metal from "+" to "-" terminals for awhile, with the volume turned UP, you might. Some frayed wire across terminals shouldn't do it. More likely your wiring or connections are poor. Get a quality set of speaker wire and make sure the connectors at both ends are solid, not loose, and switch that good set of wiring from channel to channel. If the problem goes away with new wiring, that's it. If the problem stays on the same channel regardless of good wire and connections, you may have a bad component.  Always keep the power off when changing connections, and keep the volume all the way down on channels you aren't testing. This means moving the balance to one side and the fade to front or rear, and any center channel and subwoofer turned all the way down unless you're testing them. Wiring and connectors are less reliable than the guts of components, and cheaper besides. Rule them out first.

AJjMEk4caa	Bluetooth is a method of sending files (Photos, music, etc.) between bluetooth enabled devices (Phones, some Computers). Most cellphones these days have the ability to send files via blutetooth. To do so, make sure that bluetooth is turned on and then go options on the file you want to send. You will then have to select the other cellphone in the list (Making sure the other person has the cellphone bluetooth on). Once the person you are sending to accepts the files, it will send.     Your cellphone will be able to play music, just make sure it is in the MP3 format. It will be able to download ringtones of the internet, just from the phone only, not off the computer.     If you want to send a file from your computer to a cellphone, buy a bluetooth dongle like this: http://cgi.ebay.com.au/100M-2-4G-USB-2-0...    and then do the same steps as above.    Good Luck!

VMVW3E7Aaa	About the color accent option: it seems to be a current fad that people are getting excited about.  The camera keeps one color and turns everything else black and white.    I would never use such a feature for the following reasons:    ? You are very limited in what you can do.  ? The function isn't always reliable or accurate. The camera's idea of "red" might be different to yours. It will often include/exclude areas that don't want to be included/excluded.  ? Imagine  if you just happened to take your best photo ever, but instead of having a real color photo, you only have some partial b&w thing that might look totally awful. You'd kick yourself.  ? If you do the "Selective or Partial Desaturation" (as it is called correctly) in post processing, you have much more control over it, and will get a way better result. Plus you can keep your original color version, too.    This also applies to any color effects done in camera like b&w or sepia - you're better off NOT to.    If you don't have your own image editor, you can go to www.picnik.com and use their effects menu which makes it very easy.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	you can remove colors in photoshop|`|NZxvybYUaa	Here's a link to a FREE program that will do what you're wanting:  http://www.gimp.org/  And here's a link to a tutorial that shows you how to do it:  http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Selective_...

oUW90Oy6aa	The comment about Oblivion is actually very untrue.    For example, on the PS3 version of Oblivion the game came with "Knights of the Nine" which was an expnasion version that the PC/360 users had to pay 10 dollars for seperately.    There is also the Shivering Isles expansion pack that PS3 users can buy seperately, or on the PS Store.    The thing with Fallout is Microsoft paid Bethesda off for DLC Exclusivity. So, the PS3 can never have it.|`|AA12146249	Bethesda did the same thing with Oblivian they did not have DLC the only way ps3 got the expantion was with the GOTY edition. suck but true.

ANYTHING is available for a price. People fail to realize that if Sony sold Microsoft the rights that they would make a small amount of EVERY add-on blu-ray player sold by Microsoft (if the deal was structured that way, which it most likely would be.)    The REAL reason that the blu-ray add-on won't be coming to the 360 is simple: Microsoft feels it is unnecessary since you can currently stream 1080p movies via Netflix and they feel that streaming movies is the future instead of a dvd/BD-dvd format.|`|hnXS1Nttaa	Microsoft will never release a Blu-Ray Disc add-on for the Xbox 360.     1. BluRay has not still not taken off to a mainstream audience. DVD's make up more than 90% of the market, the remaining 10% of the market is BluRay. Many analysts and companies believe that it won't ever take off,  saying that DVD will continue to be the format of choice, until digital distribution (movies and games bought through online marketplaces) -  is brought about.  2. BluRay is a Sony technology. Microsoft will have to pay licensing fees, etc. to incorporate Blu-Ray into the Xbox Catalogue.|`|8oDGnVhcaa	If Sony Co. if they decide to give Blu-ray technology & permition, then yes Micro will make a (Blu-ray add-on player).Plus, not only that, Sony Co. they could use $ since there labor cut.|`|raEUval8aa	HOW ABOUT NEVER!|`|DkImvrpgaa	doubt it because its owned by sony....

Try Cucusoft DVD to iPod + iPod Video Converter Suite,it support convert video to iPod directly. Some other software need two steps: 1. convert video to avi; 2. convert output avi to iPod.

Svgru3Tnaa	Ahhh, Im sorry that your not feeling well. But, I do not believe you need to go to the ER. (although I am NOT a doctor)  Its sounds to me like maybe your stomach might be a little upset from your activities that could have given you stomach cramps. Or maybe its just that you need to "use the restroom" or have some gas. Try and eat something light and not heavy on your stomach like soup and crackers and sip on some ginger ale while watching some t.v for a bit. A 24 hr. bug might be flying around and I would take it easy for the night. I doubt Tylenol will help a stomach problem. Either way get some rest and I hope you feel better soon!!|`|AA12142423	hypochondriac|`|s815uPJVaa	have you tried eating something high in calories and going to sleep|`|1VGx2BLvaa	NAW yOU iiS JUS TRiPPiN|`|IMpnREJqaa	when i dont eat much and i get really hungry i feel like im going to throw up and sometimes my stomache hurts. you probably feel like your going to faint because you need to eat.|`|9XJLlPaEaa	Maybe that new cell phone plan from Verizon will work.

You have to buy it,  If you're thinking of getting it, don't hesitate. Get it. One of the best phones I've ever had. If you're concerned about the ringtones, just use mytinyphone.com. You can send yourself ringtones from that site or you can download the mp3 version of the ringtone and send it to yourself through email. yournumberhere@tmomail.net

BMConIedaa	You can't, and Nintendo did that on purpose.  Nintendo does not put cheats in their games at all anymore, and that rule goes double for online games.  If someone told you that there was a cheat for any Nintendo game for the Wii, they're either lying, or really misinformed.    What, did you expect everything in the game to be served on a silver plate?    You can increase the odds of Redd carrying authentic paintings by decorating your room according to the rules of the game's Feng Shui system - Red items against the east wall, Yellow items against the left, and Green items on the south wall.  My girlfriend and I have bought 3 authentic paintings in a row, after finding 2 fakes.  Its just plain random, just like 80% of the game itself.|`|M1OKvcqYaa	Theres no way to tell, some people say if you feng shui  your house of have "Lucky items" (like the cats) then this will increase your chances of the paintings being real.   Another rumour is if the people in the city are commenting that Redd sells fake paintings then that week the painting is fake, tho again its not proven.      There may be a cheat - but for wii's its not a simple code - you have to install files on a SD card then transfer them to your wii via a platform like Gecko - which i personally think is too risky.

If you want something really high tech, then get the ipod touch. There are tons of awesome games you can play on there. And if you have wireless internet you can go on the internet at your house.

It's the "funnest ipod ever"|`|FTCeDLJraa	Wow, seriously??    The ipod touch is soo much better than any of the nanos.

Great for when jogging excersing , the screen is a decent size, it holds lots of music ......cons: not as good when it comes down to games and watching movies......it all depends on what u want in it! So hopefully this helps choosing! Good luck!

Here are the minimum specs for the PC version:  * CPU: AMD 64 3200+ / Intel Pentium 4 3.0GHz +  * Memory: 512MB (XP) or 1GB (Vista)  * HD Space: 8GB   * Graphics Card: Nvidia 6600GT/ATI Radeon 1600XT or higher (Shader 3.0 or better) with 256MB memory     To play online, you'll need your connected to a broadband line, which usually requires some sort of network card, depending on your broadband modem or home network setup.    Basically, if your computer was put together within the last couple years, and you put high-end parts into it, it should work.    Otherwise, you'll probably need an entirely new PC.

AA12343006	The data plan should be $35!!! That's with unlimited internet usage and unlimited text messaging.     The $25 data plan is unlimited web usage as well but it comes with only 400 text messages. Why are you paying more than $50 for the data plan?    And would you really use 600 minutes? Just asking because there are cheaper talk plans than that. You can get the myfaves 300 minutes for $30 or $40 I believe and then make any people your 5 faves and get free minutes with them.     Woah woah, look into everything again! that's too much for a min wage job|`|34cg4wyJaa	Definetly.|`|fIAdnGDeaa	UHM YEAH THAT IS!  can u say which one youre getting?  but anyway I have one and all and in school i almost NEVER have internet service. I mean i love the lx and all and idk what i would do with out it  but theres alot of other phones out there that are even cheaper and theyre actually worth it.   i pay 30 a month (well my parents do) cause i have the plan and all  youre gonna pay almost 100 bucks...dats way tooo much for your age unless you're parents are gona pay for the whole thing like mine are doing.  im saying its not worth 100 bucks a month. like at allll
AbRfd29Haa	There are two possibilities.     First is that the disc itself is defective. Try it in a different Blu-Ray player (different model) to see if it'll play there or not, and if it fails in the same place, blame the disc. Take it back to where you bought it and get a replacement.     The other possibility is that your Blu-Ray player is at fault. Blu-Ray is a fairly complex specification, and most players were initially released with bugs. As those bugs are discovered, reputable manufacturers release firmware updates to fix those issues (one reason I bought the PS3 -- Sony uses the PS3 to work out all their Blu-Ray issues, so it not only gets updates, but it gets them first, and they can fix virtually any problem in software).     If your Blu-Ray player has an internet connection, it's likely it can check on-line for updates. If not, you may be able to download a patch from the manufacturer's web site and load it onto the player with a CD-R or flash memory device.|`|e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	It could be defective.  Find another player to try it on or simply take it back to the store you bought it from.  If you tell them it doesn't work on your player and you just want another copy of the same movie, there should be no problem with them replacing it.  I've had to do this on occasion and there was no issue.

PjhrL6PMaa	It's only sold in Japan. It was announced in 2005, I believe, then the world was told it was only going to Japan. I am ordering mine from play-asia.com  I recently looked into this myself. In USD, it costs $49.90 and about $6 shipping, so probably a little about $110 total for Canada.  Also, the camera is not region specific. You know how some products are compatible with only products from that country..? Not the case with chorro shoot.    Chotto Shoot is a 1.3 megapixel camera than takes pictures and stores them directly to your pictures folder. It also records digital videa, I assume it's unlimited recording time, until your card is filled up, but I know it can record video... 100% sure. Most of this info is on the play asia site... leme find a direct link to the page... (3 minutes pass)... here it is!  http://www.play-asia.com/paOS-13-71-bh-7...    Hope this helped!!! I'm excited about it and can't wait til it's back in stock.
0xz8mR2xaa	Duplicator? Technicolor was a maker of vibrant color stocks that trounced Kodak, leading people to use the company's name as an adjective for anything that was really dynamic or hyperreal. If they make DVDs and are going bust, oh well. Plenty of other companies, especially Sony, stamp DVD media. In 2009, one can still get audio casettes, 5 1/4" floppies and VHS tapes commercially duplicated, so fear not for the spring-chicken DVD.    @Lassie. Nothing will be left but still-overpriced HDMI cables and obsolete knick-knacks. By the times prices are seriously slashed, there'll be nothing left. In fact, most of the TVs and computers went in the first few days, and I bet Blu-ray players are sold out by now, too.|`|BX02pF4Maa	Wait until the very end. Liquidation sales are all about making as much money as they can before going belly up.|`|l7Pi8MVgaa	Well I believe that the best time to go would be like feburary 17th because right now the prices are all extra high.  I Believe that if you go on feb. 17 then you'll make it just in time when prices hit really low and right before everything is gone because there like closing up on like march 9th|`|UAYzLyN4aa	I really don't understand what most of this question has to do with Circuit City liquidations.. except that, I guess, the OP is looking to buy a Blue Ray player cheap.     Other posters are correct: It's true that the best markdowns won't happen until the very end. It's also true that if you wait until the very end the "good stuff" you're interested in will likely have been sold already and the store will look like a disaster area. Any high ticket items that remain will likely be open box units with missing remotes, demo units abused by every kid who's gone through the store, etc.     What you find will be highly dependent on the individual stores and what has sold there.     And keep in mind that if anything goes wrong with your BRP that you bought at the Circuit City liquidation, you won't be able to take it back to the store. You'll be dealing strictly with the manufacturer's warranty.     If you want a bargain on a BRP I would:    - think about getting a Sony Playstation 3 with the BRP. It's apparently a really good BRP and it plays some pretty cool games, too.     - check out overstock.com .     - check on craigslist for local deals. Someone might have lost their job and selling off recent purchases to make ends meet. This stuff gets snapped up pretty quickly, though.    - check out hotdealsclub.com (not really a club, just a "news of great deals" blog).    re. Technicolor, I don't think this means "DVD is dying" so much as it means "everyone is having trouble." In fact in today's economy when the choice is between a $20 BR disc and a $10 DVD, I'd bet on the DVD selling a lot more.

j5Apt8hWaa	You will have to actually test them.  It really has to do more with your skills using a camera.   If you are a sports photographer and you are following focus during plays, you will notice that there are really no difference ... I shoot both brands and have not noticed any differences in the real world when it comes to auto-focus.  One thing that has changed is not the speed at which they focus, but the way the camera follows focus.  Some have 51 focus points and others can actually follow focus using a specific colour, which is great for shooting field sports since the jerseys are most always different colours.     If you depend upon lab measurements to decide which cameras you want and need you may be disappointed.    You need to take a lot of time researching before you choose a camera system.  How fast an entry level camera and lens focuses is not one of the criteria that should lead the top of you list.      Look at the number of lenses available in each system and what professional features are on the top of the line cameras.  Then when you start building your camera system, you will have the one that you will use for your whole career.   This means you will want really take your time and make absolutely sure you are buying is the right one for you.    If you are not going to shoot professionally, you will not be effected by a few milliseconds difference in the lenses auto-focus and actually we aren't either.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Canon 40d is faster.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	canon 40 D. check the reviews online|`|pZGLhV2Waa	Canon may be potentially faster but a lot of this will depend on the lens you are using. For instance Canon's L series lenses focus extremely fast while some of the cheaper lenses or after market lenses are very slow. Of the Canon lenses the L series will be the quickest followed by the USM lenses. They use the same motors but the L series are better.  The fastest lenses to focus will have a specialized focus motor. Canon calls these lenses USM for ultrasonic motor. Nikon also has lenses like this and they are called SWM or silent wave motor. Sigma calls their version HSM or Hyper Sonic Motor.
Dso7k3sjaa	Some people say that if you hold ctrl/shift/windows down and press the c key that this will open the cheat box.  I actually don't know if this is true or not as the people who say it are in Vista and on a different type of PC than I have.  So, you can try that.    Otherwise, some people find that this works:    Make sure the game is closed.  Now, pretend you are in the game and try to open the "cheat" box by holding down ctrl/shift and hitting the c key.    Does some other program open up?  If so, it means those three keys have been assigned as "hot keys" to open that program and this is interfering with the ability to open the cheat bar while in the game.    To fix this problem, make sure you remember the name of the program.  Now close it and then find that program in your Start/Program menu.  Do not open it though.  Instead, just right-click on the name of the program, scroll down and click on Properties.  Now look for a spot that talks about "hot keys" or any spot where you see those three keys written.  Either simply delete the keys so the program won't open using hot keys, or change them to different keys.    Now, if there is a spot to click on that says Apply, do that. If not, simply exit out of it.  Restart your computer so the change takes effect.  Now open your game and try to open the cheat bar.    Hopefully one of those two things will work for you.  If  not, I don't know anything else to try, sorry.  :-(

The wii is lacking on that and I do not feel that it is worth it to play a game on the wii that would be better on a different system. The wii is made for mario kart, wii play, wii sports, zelda, and possibly resident evil 5(we will find out shortly).|`|YYSq5PGyaa	Well I've played Batallion Wars, it's an awesome game, and the online is fun, though I doubt anyone is still playing it online.. As for world at war, i've never played it, but Ninendo Power magazine gave it an 8.0. I've refrenced the magazine site down below. Hope this helps!
3K1QW7Oeaa	I heard that those headphones are great. I would test them out if they sell them in stores.
3K1QW7Oeaa	I would HIGHLY recommend SONY headphones instead of Bose!    You can buy BETTER headphones! [You can basically get whatever, but there are two sides of the story]    Bose has an awful quality and disappoints me EVERY TIME.    Trust me, I've tried it all!    I tried their $99 desktop speakers! They sounded like my brothers laptop speakers! Replaced them with $60 Altec Lansing spakers! BEST PURCHASE!    I tried the $149 Bose Tri-Port headphones. My $20 Sony headphones almost matched the same quality! The only difference is that the Bose headphones added WAY TOO MUCH bass, it got annoying (and I LOVE bass.)    To the $600 5.1 speakers (disappointment!) You got an annoying hiss from the small speakers and they were noticeable as you turned the volume. There was also too much bass in the subwoofer and there seemed to be no way to fix that, regardless of how much you turned the back knobs.    Decided to try the $1000 system which was the BIGGEST disappointment of them all! They sounded awesome. They sounded awesome, until I heard my grandmother's Infinity system! That $1000 system was gone!    In the end, got an Infinity system and love it! They sounded BETTER than the $1000 system and more for half the price!!    Bottom line: Bose is crap! Why else do you think they NEVER got THX certified (THX is the BEST recognition for speakers?) All they are obsessed about is features that nobody seems to give a crap about. So for $100 In-Ear headphones, all you're buying is the name, NOT the quality. Go for Sony or Senheiser (oh, yea. Senheiser is GREAT)!!|`|9e11a8bfdb68534bad7a82a7d59ef55aaa	Bose is best!|`|p0D4dxEqaa	Apple|`|OFPaqKDvaa	SkullCandy. Or Bose.    SkullCandy - It`s a `brainscratcher` which means goes right in the ear canal. They have great bass and different sizes of earbuds from small to large and even memory foam.    Bose - You asked between Bose and Apple... I chose Bose.|`|9WxIYtEfaa	Definitely Bose!! They are really great quality and last a really long time!|`|Jk6IDgWRaa	Bose, though apple may have better quality, the comfort level is below par. They never seem to fit your ear and they get really aggravating to deal with. Bose are form fitting and they are comfortable.|`|sqtpMjkVaa	both good|`|25fYPqhGaa	Bose, BY FAR    Bose has been around for a long time and specialize in music related items. Bose is more expensive but you get what you pay for for sure    i own both brands personally and find that the bose ones are more comfortable, especially during the cold when the plastic in the apple ones go very hard    Good luck,  austin|`|g1ncRtG1aa	BOSEEEE. one there hella lot better then ipod for sure. more expensive means more better. apple make alright ones but bose is better. i had ur same situation. frind had i ipod so i boaght bose. then l8ter he went to go get some|`|qJjhs6jYaa	bose|`|0eu3BqhJaa	Bose definitely|`|dh7wqLlhaa	Between Apple & Bose - Go for Bose.     But since you even mentioned Bose - it means either you are a Girl or you are new into Quality earphones.     For the same money as the Bose tri-port you can get a Sennheiser CX500, which is miles ahead of the Bose in Sound quality, Passive noise isolation, comfort & warranty (CX 500 has 2 yr warranty) - I know cos I got the CX 500 first, gave it for a CX 95 & today am getting a Sennehiser CX 6.    Anyone with little knowledge about Quality sound should not & would not touch a Bose with a long stick.     All the best (^_^)
sPQBluKEaa	the internet might not work, so you might not be able to send or receive picture messages, but that's about it.
CbqY3PYyaa	The Blackberry is better, yes it does not have the touch screen but it has amazing capabilities that the iPhone doesn't, the problem with the iPhone is that the screen scratches WAY to easily and it freezes ALOT! i had the iPhone and so did my dad so im speaking through personal experience, my dad has a blackberry for work and its really durable, he has dropped it in puddles, dropped it from a roller coaster >.|`|9WxIYtEfaa	iPhone. I have had both. I like the interface of the iPhone a lot better. It is so much easier to navigate. There are SO many handy applications that you can download with an iPhone as well that are easy to use and that you don't have to pay for. Blackberry apps can be confusing and well as costly. You also can download from iTunes on the iPhone. I used to love Blackberry. The new Blackberry with the touch screen might be okay. Maybe you could go look at both in the store and that would help you decide better. Play with it for awhile and look at the texting to see how you like the different interfaces. In my opinion though, the iPhone is way better.     The iPhone screen does not scratch. My Blackberry was WAY more scratched than my iPhone ever got. I have put the iPhone in my pocket with my keys and dropped it a million times and it is fine! :)  A Blackberry is good but an iPhone is a lot better.|`|VPqpmRiOaa	I have the Blackberry Pearl, and I wouldn't recomend you get one.  I have had nothing but problems with it.  Everyonce in a while it decides to erase all my messages and missed calls.  so then i have to remove the battery and reset the phone so i can use it again.  it is very annoying so if you dont want to lose messages or calls then dont get the blackberry pearl.  It has the internet but I never get much use out of it because the screen is so small you dont get to see much, and it is very slow.  I never figured out how to work the navigator.  my brother in law has the iphone and he loves it.
6wIfS0b9aa	it means u may have dropped it too many times causing the ink inside the screen to smeer.    this is what happened to my phone.    and because the ink smeered, it is loosing its color and turning white.    ...time for a new phone...|`|yC7hgBfGaa	the apocalypse|`|ZIUDcqfmaa	happened to my sister in middle school, she sat on it on a really hard wood and the screen just went black unless the screen has like real black ink inside the cover then i can help you then.|`|Gkf0dWYdaa	WHAT YOU SAID IN YOUR TITLE!|`|NBf5q2f5aa	get a free phone|`|At7WLduQaa	you might of left it out in the sun, or dropped it in water, find out of you still have warranty|`|aBWT7SbMaa	means u need a new one. phones are like what only 300$ max? for a nice 1|`|U3A3m6elaa	It means get a new phone.|`|uwCcIY8Aaa	busted.  buy a new phone  sorry ):  or take it back to where you got it. and consult them about it.|`|0zpWVq0Iaa	Yes,  it might mean it got wet somehow,  or maybe its just damaged.

If u don't like it, why not buy a new 1?
Ur6H8gwkaa	You don't fix it. There is nothing to fix.    In the end, it's meaningless.    Your camera has a 10 megapixel resolution, period.    The 72 dpi only refers to a print size. Meaning, on the long side of a full size pic, about 3,888 pixels, at 72dpi which really means ppi (pixels per inch) of 54 inches.    Some software programs will handle this differently. For example my Sony software (for Sony A700) shows my jpegs at 350dpi, and other software shows it as 72dpi, either way, the pixel count remains the same. You won't gain or lose resolution either way.

Bye !|`|gBKcBKuaaa	Yeah its worth it if it drops it justs get scraped, yet is superior to the other MP3 players. My brother has one, he has had it for about 5 months now and it hasnt done much besides the stuff all ipods do, freezes frequently, hold button sometimes gets jammed(but rarely) and it can get you frustrated, my brother gets so pissed at its freezings, and the fact that the middle button got out of wack and rarely works, you have to hit it hard in a corner for it to click. But some positive sides are that it has coverflow, most of the ipod generation have had errors and they worked most out, and it has a nice diplay, its light weight, looks great, and has a reasonable compacity with a great price. its worth it but you might be upset b/c they have many technical errors still.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	It should be fine. Don't worry about it. Just purchase it and have fun with it!|`|WV12FdQ9aa	mine was study....i dropped it out of my car window by accedent while pulling into my driveway it survived with minor scratches so i think you will be just fine....its fun to flip around too|`|4RLjQ4M4aa	all the nanos are sturdy. if you drop it, it'll be fine. they are designed with the intentions of being sturdy.|`|2M4vSXkqaa	Yes! I love my ipod nano 4th gen. It's amazing. Sturdy? yes I bought an iSee or iClear case, to protect it. it's clear and hard, and keeps it from getting scratched or damaged|`|klkt4VAqaa	yeah its sturdy.    i have that ipod and i keep dropping it and its now got all these scratch mark on it...........but it still works properly
eYlCBHPHaa	First check if it can hold a charge, because that model is known for having charger problems. Sim Cards are available at T-Mobile stores.|`|YtT2RMxIaa	I'm guessing its a t mobile so I would try the t mobile store but you gotta open an account|`|AA11757270	At your local Tmobile store or on Ebay.|`|AA11458683	ITS BATTERY IS PROLLY DEAD U CAN GO TO WALMART OR RADIO SHACK TO GET A CHARGER FOR IT AS FAR AS THE SIM CARD  YOU CAN GO TO EITHER AN ATT STORE OR TMOBILE STORE TO GET A SIM CARD IDK WHO HAS A SIDEKICK 3 BUT ATT AND TMOBILE ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT USE SIM CARDS
1CGuppFKaa	I have the Samsung Propel and I love it. It is durable and really easy to text on even though the keys look small. I had the phone figured out the first day I had it, but if you check out the user's manual you find out even more stuff that you can do on it; the camera is decent for a phone-camera (no flash); the web browser is pretty fast; good sound quality on voice calls; the fact that it's a slider phone is convenient. Unfortunately I haven't gotten around to buying a USB cable for it yet so I haven't put any of my music on it (it would have been nice if it came with one). The only annoying thing I've found is that the keypad automatically locks after just a few seconds. I can't figure out how to fix this for the life of me, but you get used to it after awhile. It's a great phone overall and I highly recommend it. Good Luck!|`|AA11458683	THE QUICKFIRE IS A GOOD ONE TOO.. JUST LOOK AT ATT.COM/WIRELESS AND LOOK AT THE QWERTY KEYBOARD PHONES..
HdTU4UO0aa	yea, it is.   this is the link:    http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...    under specifications, towards the bottom of the page, it says: "Storage Media   SD Memory Card, SDHC Memory Card, MultiMediaCard " are all compatible with your camera.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	DO'NT WORRY, IT IS. I DONT KNOW WHAT PETRAS PROBLEM IS, :) i don't know what year your camera is. but it'll say in the manual. let me check online. PETRA IS WRONG...CHECKOUT THE LINK BELOW, AND, OR CALL CUTOMER SUPPORT|`|6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	Well, at first I thought it didn't, because the Advanced User Guide didn't mention it in the Specifications...but if you look in the Basic User Guide, it actually says it IS compatible with SDHC cards (page 8). So, your card will be fine.  Be sure to format it (in the camera) before you use it).    p.s. grow up "you know who"

Xxviy63Paa	You have to switch back to the XMB operating system, which requires a reboot and then changing the boot flag by typing "boot-game-os" at kboot.    PS3 games will only run on the XMB, not on any other platform. Although the XMB is technically still in control when you run linux, the linux OS takes up so many resources that most games wouldn't work. Also, the RSX graphics chip and its memory, fully half the ps3's RAM, is blocked from access from anything but XMB. So no hardware-accelerated game would work in OtherOS at all, actually.    There are some games you can play in OtherOS. Quake 2 works because you can play it with software rendering. There are a number of other games, most of them small. I recommend Liquid War which runs fast as blazes on ps3, because it doesn't need 3d rendering and the linux OS uses at least 2 of the Cell's mighty processors.    Any game you play under OtherOS must be either precompiled for PC architecture, or you will have to build it from source. If you're not experienced at such things, well, you may as well learn, it will increase your computer literacy as well as make you less prone to buying useless, overpriced software.    What you will use the OtherOS for mostly isn't games, it's things the ps3 XMB can't do. Like download video from youtube instead of just watching it. Like transcoding video into Div-X to work on your ps3. Like ripping internet radio. Like posting on YA which the XMB web browser can't do, because its Java plugins can't tell the difference between the "submit" and "edit" buttons and recognizes them both as "edit." And any other thing that pc's can do that ps3's can't.    YDL is a decent linux but it is not the best, Ubuntu is better by far and there is way more user support. It's at psubuntu.com
GUYVtwCcaa	i personally think i shouldnt have bought it.      main reasons: (btw im really critical about games, especially since a lot of ppl say this game was the best)    1. repetitive gameplay, all you do is the exact same thing over and over, interogate people by beating them up to get answers, pick pocket the same stuff for information.    2.one of those games, where you have to build up your health, and as you go on you get more weapons, etc.  but worst, say u get a new weapon such as the last sword (which u get near the end of the game) when u play the game again after beating it, u only get the sword when u first get it.  so...starting over again makes u--well start over again.    i thought couldve had some more rpg elements to it as well|`|UGKYyykVaa	It's amazing.

If you like lame, repetitive game play, terrible voice acting, go for it!  The game is not as open ended as some would lead you to believe.  It is pretty as hell though...|`|VcNHahtgaa	The game is more of a "Rent"    It doesn't really have any replay value and all you do is kill people in different cities, that's it.

iv8Saahtaa	Zune, Ipod sucks, plus the Zune has a HDD with way more space.|`|Gy5OV6CZaa	Zune is better than the Nano but the Ipod touch is better than anything out, except the iphone.|`|0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	People always wonder this question, and I always reply with the same answer. It depends on what you really want, both are great devices and can work easily and at ease they both will be advantages in the long run.    Pros of Zunes:  Easy to use, and get used to.  Small, stylish, and very flashy.  Cheap music and very nice.  Affordable and cheap.  More features then an Ipod.  Great quality.    Cons of Zunes:  People asking why you got a Zune instead of Ipod.  Takes a while to download from computer to device easily.    Pros of Ipods:  High tech.  Stylish, and nice.  Feels nice and comfortable with a hold.  Good features.    Cons of Ipods:  Expensive for what your getting.  Service is bad.  Quality is horrible.  Bad battery life.  Apple tries to hard.    What I really recommend anyone to get, is the Zune because it's cheaper and does a lot more then the Ipod can do. The Ipod may have some cool features but Apple is actaully a big screw up. These have very bad battery life, and they die easily. Any sight of water near the Ipod will ruin the device. I'm sure that the Zune is a lot better. Now you tell me what one is better, this will be very helpful when trying to choose, I really really recommend the Zune over the Chromatic any day, unless you want to regret it. Get the Zune.|`|25fYPqhGaa	You can get more storage for your money if you go with zune but apple has better customer care if something was to happen to your ipod within the warranty.    if you aren't all into the "being in the crowd thing" i would recommend getting a zune    best of luck,  austin|`|dh7wqLlhaa	Almost everything sounds better than an ipod.
