XLHrIFA4aa	Not really, to fight it you're going to get charged all sorts of fees and stuff. It's best just to pay it unless you can't afford to lose 3 points. There's not much you can do, they trust cops more than the rest of us.|`|0efdb09e1638363fed9f8404e8a84c77aa	I've worked traffic off and on for nearly 30 years and I'm not familiar with a "careless driving" violation.<br>  <br>  Do you want to fight the ticket so your insurance doesn't go up? Or to prove a point?<br>  <br>  If it's because of the insurance the easiest thing to do is plead guilty and ask for traffic school. You still have to pay the fine, and go to traffic school, which you have to pay for also, but at the end the ticket doesn't go on  your driving record. In California you can only go to traffic school every 18 or 20 months, I forget, so if you've gone recently that option is out.<br>  <br>  If you want to fight it to prove a point then you need to go back to the area, make an accurate sketch of the street and intersection and show that the officers version of the events couldn't have happened the way she said they did. You have to keep in mind that, while the judge is supposed to be impartial, the court believes that the officer doesn't have an axe to grind and issues citations because they see the violation occur, whereas the citizen is trying to keep from being found guilty of the ticket because of the fine, the points and the increase in insurance so they may embellish the facts, or leave information out.<br>  <br>  Before you decide to go to court is there any possibility that the officers version could have happened? If there is, you lose.<br>  <br>  The court isn;t overly concerned if one of the streets is inaccurate, or the name is spelled incorrectly, or even if they got the make and model of your car wrong. They are interested in whether or not you made the traffic violation.<br>  <br>  If you go the court doesn't like long, verbose rants, accusations about the officers demeanor, excuses about why you did or didn't do something. Jot down notes, the officer did, keep your statements and answers short and simple and don't be a whiner or complainer.<br>  <br>  I was taking my friend home. As we approached the left turn on Merry Drive I signaled my lane change, checked my mirrors, the lane was clear, changed lanes. I then signaled my left turn from Christmas Lane, to Merry Drive, slowed, and when there was a break in the oncoming traffic I turned left.<br>  <br>  Short and simple.<br>  <br>  If the officer testifies you cut her off ask the judge if the officer can draw her recollection of the violation on the chalk board. Ask her questions like, what was your speed? (was this at night?) were your headlights on? How much faster were you going than I was? Simple straightforward questions that will discredit her account of the incident. If your recollection was different than ask the judge if you can draw the intersection the way you remember. Keep in mind that if you lose, you can't go to traffic school.<br>  <br>  The last possibility is, she won't show up in which case..... you win.|`|7L0zp7O6aa	So you are saying the officer just made the whole thing up to give you a bogus ticket and you did nothing wrong?  I highly doubt it and if you do believe this, you probably should go back to driving school.|`|pZvJpuJTaa	Tell it to the judge!!|`|QzAdWvW0aa	Sorry but I seriously doubt it. The only possible way would be with an attorney and that is going to cost you. You may want to challenge it if your licenses are full of points though so as not to loose your licenses. Some times an attorney can get a ticket changed to a no moving violation and prevent points, but they will still want the fines. Some smaller county's that do not have the funds to fight these tickets with some one that receives one will back off on their own if they think you are going to fight it. They don`t have the money to deal with these nuisance tickets and will offer you a deal on their own especially if you mention attorney. Something to think about. <br>  <br>  My son got a reckless driving ticked in my T Bucket. He told them he was going to go to jury trial and they dropped it to a muffler violation. No points but he still had to pay a fine

DuA8rmyNaa	NO! It has to be 300watts RMS x1 at 4 ohms<br>  <br>  this amps will be exactly perfect for your two subs!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductID=20962" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/...</a><br>  <br>  hope i helped! =]|`|8AQw9xqBaa	Just Googgled kicker c10 and this is what I came up with:<br>  *10" Single voice coil<br>  *8 ohm independence<br>  *150 Watts RMS<br>  *300 Watts max<br>  *Sensitivity 87.3 db<br>  *Sealed enclosure volume min.- 1.0- cubic foot Max volume 2.4 cubic foot<br>  *Vented enclosure vol. 1.25 - 1.75 cubic feet<br>  <br>  If your box is within those specs that speaker should be able to get to 112 db at its max limit of 300 watts. At 150 its 109db which would be just noticeably quieter.  For most people that would be loud.  Around 85db is normal conversation.   I made some assumptions about the specs given in the speaker info, as most of them do the left out some critical info which could make a lot of difference but if you assume 1 watt / 1 meter for sensitivity my numbers should be good.  That is also only going to work if your box is within the specs they list for that driver.<br>  <br>  Here is OSHA's chart for what they consider safe:<br>         TABLE G-16 - PERMISSIBLE NOISE EXPOSURES (1)<br>  ______________________________________...<br>                              |<br>    Duration per day, hours   | Sound level dBA slow response<br>  ____________________________|_________...<br>                              |<br>  8...........................|                    90<br>  6...........................|                    92<br>  4...........................|                    95<br>  3...........................|                    97<br>  2...........................|                   100<br>  1 1/2 ......................|                 102<br>  1...........................|                   105<br>  1/2 ........................|                   110<br>  1/4  or less................|                115 <br>  <br>  So by that chart you should be able to do damage to your hearing fairly easily by listening for more than 1/2 hour per day.  If you want to do that damage in 15 minutes you would need do hit that speaker with almost 600 watts which would likely burn it out.

xGJAXM5vaa	I really think that your main concern should be other then whether it is a carb bike or an FI bike. I dont think that a carb bike is any more difficult to own or maintain. Basically you need to purchase the bike you want in the best condition for the least amount of money. Sounds basic? Easy? I know, easier said then done. Right? Actually it is easy especially since you are somewhat mechanically inclined. For less then $5k you can get a damn good motorcycle. For a thousand less you can get a great 600cc sportbike or Standard. You decide what style you want. Let me tell you what to look for. You do not need to buy a crashed or dropped bike. Look at the bar ends, footpegs, turn signals mirrors for road rash. Look for safety wiring on brakes and drainplugs to weed out old racebikes. sometimes bodywork can be perfect but underneath it will prove it to be an ex-racer. Also high mileage and perfect bodywork dont always "jive". Btw... dont be afraid of bikes with higher mileage. 25k, 30k isnt a bad thing. I would rather a 5 year old bike with 10k then one with 500 miles. Especially if undocumented. It is pretty hard to buy a bad bike. They are all pretty good. Just get the style you want first and enjoy shopping. As for when FI became available. It has been around for over 20 years. But carbs for a lot longer. For my sportbike I like FI. My dirt and enduros I like Carbs.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	I ride a 1968 BSA 441 Shooting Star. This Summer it will be stripped down for the second rebuild of it's life.

You would need to purchase the state required liability insurance in order to get the bond advising that you are carrying these limits. There are only a couple of reasons to need an sr22 bond and they are most commonly a DUI, too many tickets, or an uninsured accident. an sr22 filings rates depend on your age zip code driving record type of vehicle and coverages desired.

I have never heard that when a check engine light is on that it's the c.c. Now I have heard it's the O2 sensor. Usually when a check engine light comes on it means you need routine maintenance.

You can buy parts from Auto Zone or any other part store, but unless you know how to put it on then what's the point?  Now what they probably mean to be saying is that if your car is still under warranty then you can't just go and buy the part yourself and they cover it.  It would have to be an authorized dealer repair shop.  But if you have someone who could put the part on for you, then go for it at a part store.  But if your car is running ok, then I wouldn't worry about the light.  My check engine light stays on.  Nothing is wrong with my car.  Good luck.|`|bvCkplELaa	Lol at some of these answers. A check engine light can come on by having a cat thats bad, its usually code po420 or po421. Some cats are bolted to the engine and are actually the exhaust manifold. These cats can be a bit expensive. Some vehicles have cats in the exhaust system under the vehicle to where one can get a universal one welded into the system. I love all the people that just assume it's a sensor LOL. Obviously, you know Nothing about diagnostics.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Maybe it's not even the cat converter. it could be one of the sensors to the cat converter and the outtake of the converter. but go to Autozone. If the light still does not go off, you can tell them about the sensors. I know about diagnostics. And a code reading does not tell you the exact component thats bad. it tells you where the problem may be. In this case in the emissions.|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	Typical main dealer BS talk. If your car needs a Catalytic Converter then a decent one would be about €150-€350.<br>  <br>  Dealers try to fool people and don't fall for it, your local auto-parts shop will be able to order you in one but get it checked by your local Garage Man 1st.

Don't feel so bad since the labor cost is pretty high. Still I'm am so glad I took autoshop in highschool. That one course was comprehensive enough that I was able to completely rebuild a worn-out 4 cylinder  engine at home on my own, and put it in the car and drive for years.<br>  <br>  Lots of things can cause the check engine light to come on. They could narrow it down by reading the trouble codes with an OBD II code reader. It is possible that your car is OK now. The check engine light has to be turned off by clearing the trouble codes and they can do that with the same OBD II code reader. That's something you could do if you bought one of those readers and followed the instructions that come with it. That set of new spark plugs could have done the trick, but you don't kow it yet.  Simple OBD II code readers cost about $100, but fancier ones are more pricey.<br>  <br>  The convertor for $89 is good enough, if that's what you need.  The genuine part will be more expensive AND price jacked way up by Toyota, just because they can. But before spending money replacing parts until the problem goes away, narrow down which part needs replacing. They might change the convertor for whatever price you pay, and turn off the malfunction light and everything looks fine, unless the problem originated with a different faulty part and then the light comes back on  later and the new convertor might also get damaged in addition to there still being a need for the right part to be replaced.<br>  <br>  My friend bought gas at costco for his Honda and his Toyota and soon afterwards the check engine lights came on in both cars. The OBD II tester indicated a malfuntioning fuel temperature sensor. After running out the costco gas and using another brand we turned off the check engine lights in both cars and the Toyota's stayed off. The Honda's came on again. We were about to change the oxygen sensors in the Honda because their fault code came up too, but the car isn't up for smog yet, the change is a bit of work and may be one sensor or the one before the catalytic convertor  and the other one behind the convertor. You can pay your money and take your chances<br>  <br>  What I've seen at the GMC shop our work trucks were serviced by, was that they replaced any suspect part when you have a problem, starting with the most expensive, then working down until the problem ceased and you pay for all the parts. It's very wasteful, but end the end it works. I have trouble coming up with sympathy for GM crying for bailout money. I do feel compassion for the workers on the assembly line, but not so much for the cheats you meet after you buy the product.<br>  <br>  I would call the Pep Boys guys a bunch of lying crooks.|`|u3HrKSGqaa	Is your car running really poorly? If so, then you MAY have a clogged catalytic converter, but even then $1200 is a lot -- RockAuto.com is showing $200 + Shipping for the entire assembly (from exhaust manifold to muffler, includes the Resonator which is like a pre-muffler).   Just the converter which would have to be welded-fit is closer to $90.  Sounds like G&S is honest.  $289 is the price I would expect for a replacement catalytic converter, labor included. HOWEVER, you probably don't need one.<br>  <br>  The odds of the catalytic converter tripping the CEL (Check Engine Light) is low, and the most likely cause would be the Oxygen Sensors by the cat.<br>  <br>  $90 for a tune depends on what they did. If it's just the spark plugs, that's a waste of money, but more likely they also did the spark wires and distributor cap.<br>  <br>  Pep Boys is only right about "no aftermarket parts" in one case: Places with emissions regulations (smog check).  California and New York especially.  You may come across the term "49-state legal" converters -- the one state those converters aren't legal is California.  If a licensed shop such as G&S puts it in, it's fine.<br>  <br>  Head to an Advance Auto Parts and ask them to check the codes and give you a printoff.  There will be some codes, usually a Pxxxx (P, then four numbers).  <a href="http://www.obd-codes.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.obd-codes.com/</a> is a great resource to find out what causes the different problems.|`|26PzDKXsaa	If the code is P0420, you probably need a catalyst converter. O2 sensors have different codes when they are defective.<br>  <br>  Why the OEM cat is so expensive? Because it is a rather long exhaust pipe combined cat in.<br>  <br>  The cat has EIGHT year / 80, 000 mile warranty by Federal law. If your car has less the 80,000 miles on it, any Toyota dealer should replace the catalyst converter for you FREE.<br>  <br>  If  your car has more than 80, 000 miles on it, first let the Autozone people clear the code for you, and do some maintenance service, and continue to drive it as usual. Sometimes the code would not come back.<br>  <br>  After market cats do not always work well. Some last short time, and some last rather long time. If you really need a cat, I do not think PeP Boys is your first choice. To save money, go to a muffler/exhaust shop where they can cut the old cat off and weld the new one in. But long the new cat will last depend on your luck.<br>  Good luck.|`|5lMLywKFaa	GO WITH THE AFTER MARKET BUT TRY SHOPPING AROUND FOR PRICES NAPA,CHECKER'S SEE IF YOU COULD GET A BETTER PRICE,ALSO SHOP AROUND AND GET DIFFERENT PRICES FOR THE ACTUAL LABOR AND MAKE SURE TO GET A WARRANTY FOR THE ACTUAL PART,SOME MECHANICS MAY NOT GIVE YOU A WARRANTY FOR THERE WORK BEING THEY DID BUY PURCHASE THE PART,BUT MAYBE ..GOOD LUCK|`|8ip40Susaa	first off, 90$ to change spark plugs is redonkulus considering there arund 4 bucks, nd if u do buy a converter most shops will install it,..for a price of course|`|JbZJo4Wmaa	a catalytic converter CAN cause an engine light. The scanner gives a code, and the person using the scanner has to diagnose from there. It is likely that you need to replace the O2 sensors only, but it could be the cat.Ask for the code they got when they scanned it. A p0420 is probably what it is, that means that the catalyst system is below threshold.Basically, the reading from the pre-cat sensor is too close to the reading of the post-cat sensor. This could be caused by many things, including need of a tune up (a real tune up, not just plugs), it could need the cat, could need new O2 sensors<br>  Aftermarket parts dont always work well, but you will be able to use an aftermarket cat with no problems. I would recommend taking the car to a muffler shop or independent mechanic to get the catalytic converter put on, as it will be much cheaper.|`|c6e3db7b50bb0d7503383716294ba2e9aa	Yes it could be the Cat, test it w/ a scan tool at advance and see if it has the codes for it. Never go to pep boys, firestone, and etc for that kind of work or you will piss your money away. At 90 they should have done more then just the spark plugs. You can use aftermarket or else why would they sell it? Never buy from dealer unless there is no aftermarket part. If you don't have emissions in your state you don't need to even replace it but you will get piss poor gas mileage.<br>  As for you retards who answer with dumb ****: the check engine light is for EMISSIONS. I will say it again for the "special" people. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS CREATED FOR EMISSIONS.|`|l23ttRePaa	Sounds like you're being taken to the cleaners by the shops you're dealing with. They will tell you anything to be able to charge you especially if they know you don't know what they're talking about. A woman in most cases get taken more often. <br>  <br>  It could be as simple as a burned out sensor. You can have it checked with the knowlege of what you suspect it might be at a mechanic shop but preferrably not one you've already been to ... or you can purchase the auto manual yourself and test it. Our check engine comes on in about every car we've owned the past 25 years and it is still on .. on one of them A 1996 Ford Windstar Mini Van.<br>  <br>  It does not necessarily mean there's anything at all wrong with your car and in most cases probably not. My middle son is a mechanic and has all the proper tools to check these things out plus he has the proper auto manuals as well But you don't have to be a mechanic to do it. If you have the book for your particular vehicle you could figure it out fairly simple. There's some type of mode you use and it's all explained in the auto manual.<br>  <br>  I would discuss this with my son but he's working at the garage. Good luck with it.<br>  <br>  Have a great evening.

379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	It has no book value. Vehicles with salvage titles are for the most part un-insurable because they were written off as a total loss. The car you describe sounds like one suitable for parts only. I would not suggest buying it with the intention of rebuilding it. It would not be cost effective.|`|ufcjpU5baa	If the car was in perfect condition it would be 5,250 according to NADA,  With a salvage title you will not be able to trade this vehicle in and it is honestly worth nothing. This car is expensive to repair but when anyone sees that the car is salvaged it ruins the vehicle as a whole. It would cost more to fix the car then to buy the similar model now. A bent frame is the worst thing that can happen to a vehicle, when this happens it has permanent damage, even if you repair all parts of the car, the car will always have frame damage. So I would not associate with this car. I know a lot about cars don't get started into a problem!!!!

RWjvcCYoaa	No. Auto sales is a full time job with a 110% commitment. That means coming in on your day off to sell a car because its the only day your customer can make it in. That happens a lot. And you'll usually stay for about 3 to 4 hours. Sometimes, after all that time you spent there, you won't even make the sale.<br>  <br>  It means working a minimum of 50 hours a week. At most dealers, it's closer to 60 hours. It means coming in a few hours early or staying a few hours more to deliver a car. It can also mean working bell to bell on certain days every week (from open til close), depending on the size of the sales force. <br>  <br>  Being in sales sucks! You work every weekend. You have no social life. Customers treat you like s***. And so does the dealer. So why even get into it?<br>  <br>  Because if you are a real people person, you're honest, and you are lucky enough to find one of the few honest dealers to work for, this career can be very rewarding.|`|8fN13NQJaa	You got some good answers here. The other salespeople will sell people you have been working if your not there and guess what....most places your out $. As someone else stated this can be great job but for you to get most out of it you need to be there in most cases at least 50 hrs. Sucks but true. Good luck.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Very unlikely.  Car sales is typically a 40+ hr (closer to 60) position.  How would you learn the product?  How will you keep up with inventory?  How are you going to stay current with incentives, bonuses, etc?  Are you willing to forgo your commission when the customer comes back to buy & you're not there?<br>  I knew of one example where a college student worked PT (still 30+ hrs, 6 days a week).  He worked his way up in the dealership, starting as a Porter.  When school wasn't in session, he put in 40+ hrs. <br>  <br>  P.S.

ooTfG1e9aa	The monitors are not ready due to the computer either being reset or a dead battery. Whenever power is lost to the computer, all readiness monitors are reset to not ready. Driving the vehicle will normally reset these monitors (as the self tests are run by the computer). <br>  <br>  The catalytic converter test is usually run in city traffic driving conditions - 25 tp 45 mph with several stops and starts. The evap monitor will only run if particular conditions are right (i.e. intake air temp is between 38-100 degrees F and within 10 degrees of engine temp, fuel level in tank is between 15-85%), This test usually will try to run after the engine has been sitting off for 8 hours (cold soak overnight). Do not warm the engine up when trying to run this test. Cold start and drive the vehicle, avoiding sloshing the fuel in the tank, smooth acceleration, etc.<br>  <br>  Search Google for "ford obdii drive cycle" to find the specifics on the drive cycle required for each monitor.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|7NLGPESiaa	Run the car a for a half hour or so then try the test again.

AA11032586	There are several things to check. First is vehicle running hot? If so, make sure you have enough coolant/water mixture in vehicle. Have thermostat checked. You can check hoses for collapsing. If they are real soft, have them replaced. Do you have a coolant leak where the water pump is? Sometimes if the bearings begin to fail, there is a weep hole on the bottom, right at the pulley shaft, that will allow coolant to come out there. That is an indication that the bearings are going out. GM was real smart to have done that, so you won't blow your engine. I hope this gives you some things  to check out. They are listed as easiest, cheapest and most problematic. Good luck to you.|`|5xxuKzXPaa	there is just too much to a cooing system to just look at the water pump. a failing water pump will typically have a leak to it through a weep hole. in odd situations i have heard of the rotor for this pump braking off. then you just run really hot (overheat)

You should go to  AutoZone!|`|EMC7JwVBaa	I wonder if you ever had a new cambelt in the engine. That's the symptom when a worn belt jumps timing a few teeth. The next few teeth it jumps will damage the engine seriously. Have it checked soon. A timing light will show the ignition timing quite a bit off, but do not try to adjust that- it just shows that you needs to have work done. You might spend $200 for a new belt being installed. If there are other parts behind the cam belt, like some cars have their water pumps back there, don't miss the opportunity to have those things replaced now rather than pay later to go in the same place for additional repair- and additional cost.|`|AdmtsmUUaa	might be catalytic converter|`|434ae21c53144cc6040a9999bb94dfc6aa	vacum leak
z7KhGeT7aa	that's actually normal. That's what the positive crankcase ventilation PCV system is for. some gases from combustion get past the pistons into the crankcase, the PCV valve usually on the valve cover(has a hose going back to the intake) takes care of this by sending these gasses back into the air intake to be burnt again(for emissions purpose) now if you are seeing excess you could have worn rings which would cause too much blowby. usually this would be accompanied by oil building up in your air filter and air intake system
AA10357803	you'll have to figure out where under the hood your ignition coil is at ... haynes manual comes in handy then you'll simply crimp the green to the negative wire i had a newer yota and my ignition coil was on the drivers side almost under the fender ...

Or you can take it down to say maaco and get it out for really cheap.
z7KhGeT7aa	you basically answered you own question. that's why there's a thing called preventative maintenance PM. if you do not have any maintenance records then you should go ahead and replace the plugs and wires, fuel filter, air filter and oil and oil filter if you haven't done so, check the brakes, like i said you basically answered yourself it's better to spend a few bucks checking things before they go wrong than spending hundreds or thousands when they go wrong half way to work once you throw in towing and all that other good stuff|`|GGj0Mam1aa	I love you.|`|Jm0KGlIsaa	replace the coolant and transmission fluid if they haven't been replaced in a long time.  same with the spark plugs (use NGK).  also, replace the differential gear fluid (front and rear).  All these fluids and spark plugs should be replaced every 30,000 to 50,000 miles.  i wouldn't worry about the brakes until they start making the warning noise or until something goes wrong.  but the brakes can prematurely mess up if the tire technician didn't evenly apply torque to the lugnuts (i.e. overtightened them with an impact wrench) when the wheel was last taken off and put back on.  the pads can also wear prematurely if the rotors are messed up.  <br>  <br>  most important: if the timing belt has not been replaced, do so now.  this will set you back hundreds of dollars.  they'll recommend replacing the water pump at the same time...this is advisable also.  the timing belt should be replaced every 90,000 to 110,000 miles.  good luck.|`|AA10353490	If you have the owners manual, then look at it and see if they posted the maintenance schedule.<br>  <br>  I would think that after 100K miles, you are due to have the spark plugs replaced.<br>  <br>  I am sure there are also a bunch of work that it needs.  Have a mechanic look at it and give you an estimate on what needs to be done.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|ND1nFEWSaa	go to parts store and ask for;<br>  <br>  4 spark plugs<br>  distributor cap<br>  distributor rotor<br>  air filter<br>  fuel filter<br>  one set of ignition wires<br>  <br>  all should cost $ 60-70 dollars<br>  find a friend to replace or shop for $ 75.00 labor

Meaning you can do as you please and NEVER report to your parents. You can get a credit card, a bank or car loan, sign for an apartment, etc. The only thing you can't do is buy liquor by law. But it was once 18 for that too.    But realize, once 18, there is no mommy or daddy to help you. Meaning if arrested for something, its all you. So great freedom comes at 18, but also much responsibility as well.|`|bW931jBaaa	Nope, not at all  18 = adult|`|d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	Once you turn 18 you are a full adult.  You have all the same powers and responsibilities as your parents do.  You can sign contracts, get credit, buy a house, file your 1040, and vote the bastards out. You also face the full consequences of any decisions you make.  You can get swindled, make stupid decisions, get foreclosed, ruin your credit rating, dragged into court in a lawsuit, and in criminal matters you will be treated like a full adult, no more clemency for being a kid.     Welcome to the PvP server, lol!     With great responsibility comes great power, including the power to ride Amtrak.

AA10331789	The shop will tell you whether the engine and transmission are good. If so, and you can finish the repairs for another $750, that's a lot cheaper than buying a used $8000 car that might also need repairs. However, that particular car has not had a good repair history.

You can also check for SUZUKI GS 150 which is recently launched and is the only bike with 6 gears.
ZasNwdXaaa	Honda Accord 4 door. The Scion will probably beat you silly. My dad rode in one and at first he liked it. But after 300 miles he said he couldn't wait to get out. The HHR I would rate like a PT Cruiser. I think you will feel tight around the arms and doors. And if another person gets in, you will feel your space is being invaded.    An Accord has a pretty wide center console area, so it separates the people well. You also sit low enough and can sit back far enough that height shouldn't matter. And being that Accord has wider back seats than say the Civic. You should be ok there too.    Accords get anything from 26-32 from city and highway. Depending on if you get the 4 cylinder or the V6. I have looked at these myself and the 4 cylinder is the better deal. As the less mpg with the V6, never off sets the few HP you get extra. The 0-60 times are less than 1 second of each other. So the wasted gas makes no sense to me with the V6.    You could also look at the Camry, but they are much more narrow in width than the Accords are for interior. The Accord also has one of the largest trunk spaces in the sedan class. I would recommend the Chevy Impala as well. As I did drive with dad in his to Florida from Ohio straight through. And to be honest, that was the best ride I've ever had for such a long trip. Wasn't sore nor had any back aches. But the Impala isn't the best in not breaking down, etc. But its ride, space and truck are that of the Accords. If you can handle seeing the mechanic a bit more often.    Anything in the Civic, Corolla, Altima lines will be too small. Even the new Nissan Maxima is to similar to the Altima to be pleasing for what you are seeking. I can't say anything about the Ford Fusion or such as I haven't read nor driven one. But its a Ford so I will leave it at that lol.    18, looking for style, big guy. I'd find an Accord, drop some rims on it, black the windows, put on a wing. Get the thump of the subs and be done with it. Have a good car, fits you for size, economical, good on durability, most kids punk out Honda's anyways.

Examin the boat's gel coat daily and stop if you see signs of stress cracking.|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	If you've ever taken your boat in for service, you would know that the mechanic(s) need to access the controls, wiring and whatnot. This can only be done from the inside. The only problems you may run into are from the trailer. If it isn't designed for much extra weight, you will have some problems. One or two people will be fine but check the capacity of your trailer and subtract the weight of your boat for a total weight you can safely put in the boatwhle trailered.|`|6HMTlQMaaa	Yeah, that works for me as long as you don't exceed the capacity of the trailer.    You are gonna get some strange looks, however.    How about dropping it in the water and camping there?    Have fun|`|nAzbLdBCaa	Back in the mid 1970's till the early 1980's there was a boat called a Yukon Delta that was designed and marketed just for such use.  By using a wishbone trailer they avoided problems that roller style trailers might cause.  Also the stability of the boat and trailer would need to be addressed, but the concept is sound and problems can be addressed.  Mechanics move around boats all the time, with no damage. I have done this a few times, but more often I've launched the boat in the nearest water.So, it's OK.|`|I7NkFJo2aa	I know many people who use this method while taking their trailerable yacht to and from the annual cruising holidays.  In Australia driving a boat to another part of the country for a summer, or winter cruising holiday is not unusual.  Good friends of ours take their Austral 20 up to Lake Argyle and cruise for a week or three, then head back down to Sth Oz.  A round trip of 7000 - 8000 km.  They camp just fine in the boat, and meet others doing just that too.    If the trailer can't cope with a couple of people on board it won't cope with a rough road either.|`|G8IRX295aa	I do believe it is possible, and yes it is like a second RV. I wish we could bring ours with us.|`|YvaEK06Naa	My craft is an 18 foot trailer sailor and easily accommodates my wife and I.  Mind you it sits on a large keel beam while on the trailer. If the trailer is the original and not been modified it should be designed to support the boat at strongest points or traveling over a pot hole would result in a hole in the hull.  Headroom can be an issue but it beats taking another form of accommodation.  A small ladder is a must.  Cheers
KbjhAgDoaa	i would recommend setting it right in the middle, if not maybe a LITTLE on the higher side.     Otherwise, the mid knob would be for adjusting your sound for the middle range frequencies.

Otherwise, it's the relay that controls your tranny.|`|7L0zp7O6aa	I can't help with which fuse it is but you have a blown fuse.  I had the same problem in my Subaru and had to leave the car there over night.  One thing you could try is, look around the shifter for what looks like a little cap to a hole.  Remove it and stick something like a small screw driver or another key and push down while you take the lever out of park.  Most Automatics have this.  And the fuse is a 15 cent fix.  It's just going to take a little research to find the fuses and find the right one.|`|uFQFRdczaa	There's a transmission lock, it's designed to keep your car from shifting out of park unless the key is turned on and the brake is depressed.  Sometimes the lock fails to disengage.  The same mechanism can make your key stick in the ignition.  Most likely the lock/sensor in the shift lever needs some oil (or replaced), you'll need to remove some trim panels to be able to even see it.  The problem could also be in the ignition switch.  You'll probably be able to get it to unstick by jiggling the gearshift lever, but sometimes it takes a minute.|`|fDDgFrtNaa	it could potentially be many causes to the problem. the button on the side of the shifter may be sticking internally while it looks the same from the outside. but, really, im assuming that the problem is within the shifter linkage. have somebody who is knowledgeable of cars try to get the thing to move. thats all i can really tell you. good luck.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	if you do not hear a  clicking activity or noise when you put the brake on.......the shift lock mechanism is bad, or the brake switch is bad,<br>  <br>  try the lock out overide switch located on or near the shifter or called th manual release button|`|CIR768SAaa	i have no experiences w/ automatic transmissions, but give ita good jerk. or check the spring in the push button gear shift. its just like the ebrake. a spring in it controls the release. if the spring is not loaded, consequences can happen

ivH8tRtsaa	Your alternator has to have a constant positive wire from your battery to your alternator in order to produce a charge. This is called exciting the alternator.(No Joke) If the alternator is good, this is the only thing I know of that would cause the battery to go dead only when running. With the ignition on, but engine not running, Check the small single wires going to your alternator. The wire you are looking for is usually red and smaller in diameter than the other wires. The wire should be connected to its own insulated terminal on the alternator. If you don't have a volt-meter, Find a piece of wire long enough to reach straight from the positive post on your battery to the exciter wire terminal on the alternator. Connect the wire. If your problem goes away, there's your diagnosis. Even though a car can be run unharmed in this manner, it would be advisable to try and figure out why the original exciter wire is not delivering 12 volts to your alternator. Hope this helps. I'm not sure of the age of the vehicle in question, but if its older, you may want to see if it has an external voltage regulator. If it does, replace it.|`|k55p1pKraa	Make sure you have the belt on the alternator good & tight, also check the wire's that's running to your alternator& that the battery cables are tight, Make sure theres no lights lift on when the doors are shut.The alterntor should keep the car running even if the battery is bad,|`|0b17535ea0a24e5ccc0511e0b29b8602aa	Blown fuse? (ALT)|`|QzAdWvW0aa	Sounds like you still have a charging problem. I would first check and clean every battery cable connection on the car. I would also check all the ground straps leading from the engine to the fire wall and frame. Once all that is taken care of I would then drive my car over to a parts store and have them put their voltage tester on my system and check its performance. they will generally do this for free especially if you have bought parts from them. Before driving a long ways call a couple parts stores and ask if they offer this free service. We have three stores in our area and all of them do this free for us. Any how they will tell you what component isn`t doing its job. But first clean all those connections.|`|z7KhGeT7aa	you have a loose connection somewhere. follow the cables from your battery to starter and ground and see if they are loose. same with any other grounds you can easily get to on the block or frame|`|WhBc23VBaa	fuse or a bad wire <br>  the wires are easy to replace most of the time
E7RhMRKhaa	Spray paint them with good quality paint.  Krylon or something good. For best results spray a little at a time.  Don't spray too much as you will get runs in the paint.  Wheels are easy to do.  p.s.  Make sure you clean and dry them well before painting.
9GATB8Neaa	I'm presuming you are charged with VC22349, which is the statute for maximum speed of 65.<br>  <br>  The first thing to do is to go to court and request a trial by declaration from the traffic clerk. The clerk will give you the paperwork along with instructions. Fill in your current mailing address in the appropriate field. In the Statement of Facts, all you write is "I am not guilty." It should take no more than 5 minutes. Note that you will have to pay the ticket amount at this point. It should be around $150-200 for yours. Alternatively, feel free to download the form off the web (it's called TR-205), fill it out, and send it in by mail along with the bail check. Normally, it'll take around two or three months until you get the decision in the mail. Check with the clerk for dates once your paperwork is submitted.<br>  <br>  If the officer doesn't send in his response, you win (two of my tickets were dismissed that way). If he does and you're found guilty, you can always request a new trial with the officer present (trial de novo), and you will have a significant advantage in planning your defense if you get a copy of the officer's declaration from the court.<br>  <br>  Sadly, Maximum Speed charge is nearly impossible to beat in court if the officer shows up, provided it's not his first time in court. It's possible to beat a case like this on procedural technicalities, but I won't get into gory details. If you are eligible for traffic school, the judge will almost certainly offer you one as long as you dress properly and don't tick off the judge.|`|XFZmAMOAaa	$100-150|`|31Ttgqlbaa	A ticket for 10 over can easily be tossed if this is your first ticket. If the road was dry (not raining) and traffic was light, bring that up if you choose to fight it. Also, question the device the cop used to clock your speed and if it was back up by tests that it was functioning properly. <br>  <br>  And also if the cop doesn't show up on your court date to fight it, the ticket will be dismissed.|`|84150d8c6cd9fc2e974272b0e0ddc3c3aa	You don't say anything about being innocent, you actually admit you were speeding.  There is no reason for it to be tossed.  The court doesn't accept "I don't want the ticket" as a good reason to toss any ticket.<br>  If there is no amount on the ticket, then the fine will be whatever the judge feels is appropriate.|`|tnVrODt3aa	Your best bet is to contact the courts and ask them these questions. They are the ones who will process your ticket and will know all the laws and regulation. You should also ask the courts if you are allowed to take a driving school class. This will prevent your insurance from going up and points put on your license. Just make sure you get the courts permission before doing so. If you don’t the courts will reject your driving school certificate. Good luck!|`|7L0zp7O6aa	Why would they toss it if you were going 70 to 75?  He must have clocked you so he has proof.|`|dz084ZoNaa	70-75 means you were going 75.

AA10246871	First things first: money talks, and bulls*** walks. If you have the money for a down payment, and you can arrange financing, then they have no good reason for telling you you cannot test drive the vehicle. A person who walks off a lot with the keys to a vehicle they've never driven is a fool.<br>  <br>  My husband and I were in a very serious car accident (the first responders were absolutely positive I was dead because of how we were hit) in my first car, a Nissan Sentra Wagon. I ended up with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from the accident, and I really cannot be in a small car for very long--I get anxiety attacks which force me to pull off into a parking lot until I calm down. The first vehicle we bought for me after that was a Jeep Cherokee Laredo. It was a lot bigger and heavier than my Nissan was, but I had absolutely no problem driving it. When it started to wear out, I bought a Ford F-150, complete with shell (which means you can't see out the back--you have to drive with your side mirrors only), and I had no problem stepping into the larger vehicle. <br>  <br>  I do think you need to ask yourself if a F-250 Super Duty is what you really need. That's a truck which is designed for heavy haulin, and it may be more truck than you need. You may find that an F-150 will be fine. They cost less, too.<br>  <br>  The best way to learn to drive something that size is simply to drive it. You can take an intermediate step and drive an SUV, but I have driven SUVs, and they are designed to handle like a car, not like a truck. Driving them is nothing like being in my truck--they aren't as heavy, and they aren't as hard to control. Driving one is the best way to learn.<br>  <br>  If the truck is what you have your heart set on, and you know what you want, then go to another dealer who will do business with you. I don't know how old you are, but I suspect that you are either a younger man, or a woman, because those two groups get discriminated against a lot at car lots. They figure women are stupid and cannot handle a big vehicle, and they figure younger men are reckless and will kill themselves and total the truck the minute they pull off the lot. So, as I said, if that's what you want, and you can afford it, go to another dealer who is willing to do business with you.<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider right now is that a lot of newer trucks (as in 2007 and 2008 model years) are coming up for sale by private owners who simply cannot make the payments. I have even seen 2009 trucks which were probably bought last year when the new trucks came out which are for sale, and they are usually a lot cheaper than one which came direct from the factory. People bought them and then lost their jobs, or got in trouble with their mortgages, and the new truck has to go. You may be able to pick up a truck in excellent condition, with low miles, for a lot under book, just because someone desperately needs to get rid of it. Just be sure that if you buy a used truck you take it to your mechanic first and have him give it a check up to make sure everything is in order and the odometer hasn't been messed with. It's also a good idea to order a Carfax report if you buy something used.<br>  <br>  You asked how I learned to drive my truck. Well, I just kept in mind until I got used to driving it that it's heavier than most of the other vehicles on the road, and that it is larger in size. That means no squeezing into small parking spaces (I always consider how I am going to get out of a parking space before I pull into it). That also means braking earlier when you need to stop, because it takes longer for that mass to slow down. I am always mindful of the fact that if I am not careful, I can easily kill someone in a Civic, even if they make the fatal mistake. It only took me a few weeks to get used to how my truck brakes, handles, slows, and how much pick up it has when I am accelerating. I know now without having to think if I can make it when I pull out into traffic or if I need to wait. I automatically (my foot just does it, I don't think about it) start to slow down at the right time so I don't rear end someone or end up stopped in the middle of an intersection. In fact, I know my vehicle so well that I can tell how fast I am going without looking at the speedometer--I can just tell by how it feels. <br>  <br>  You can start with an SUV, but that seems a shame if you really want a truck. Just find someone honest who is willing to work with you and not feed you a lot of bull about you not having experience. If you pay attention, and you learn quickly, you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|gkrNPM5Daa	The problem isn't the size of the truck, it's what your mind has made it out to be.
