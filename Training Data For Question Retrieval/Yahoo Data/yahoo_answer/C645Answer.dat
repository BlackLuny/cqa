ze4Gt1araa	Well hopefully you broke up with him since you caught him cheating on you! And reguarding to your party I'll say don't invite him and if he shows up kick him out because it's YOUR party NOT his party. And make sure when you kick him out your grabbing hands with a guy so he can get jealous and get mad.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|iGxEExUhaa	Girl if the relationship was young just let him go. If he as the audacity to show up with the girl at the party ask him to kindly leave. Don't blame yourself that your the problem. If he shows up at the party without the girl and is asking for another chance depending on how you feel you could give him a chance.<br>  Email me back|`|pxS4pY2paa	GET BACK @ HIM.<br>  Make him jealous and start kissing sum1 else @ ur party.<br>  See us puerto ricans we might just cut da grl dat our bf is cheatin on us wit.

Break up with him!|`|5wxHdj1Naa	tell him to get lost.|`|DabYmHt7aa	hit him im being serious that guy is a gerk|`|Pxh93GHcaa	The best way of checking the strength of any relationship is in bad times. Any one can do mistakes after all we all are human but never forget one thing that when ever some goes away from you then you should not stop. If the relation is pure and he/she really loves other one then he will come back and in case they never come back that means they were never yours. So keep life simple and happy and follow this rule.|`|7dObTDdjaa	well did you break up with him? if you didnt you could try giving him a second chance if you love him. if you dont break up with him.....<br>  <br>  well if you did break up with him most likley he will not come.. but if yiu are dating hopefully he woult be a jerk and bring her. if he does then break up with him you deserve better|`|oPEmoYtsaa	Wat?????!!! He can't bring her, idk y he even thinks of going  to the party, especially wit another gurl. That would be very stupid. I think u shouldn't let him go at all. Then he'll think every thing is ok when ur feelings got hurt and if he were to go with another girl that also shows he doesn't care about ur feelings. Don't bring him to the party cuz it might be uncomfortable for while he's there.|`|WpkppV5Maa	Tell him you changed your mind and invited another young man that would love to be with you. then politely say good riddance hope all works out with the new girl and you find what your looking for.|`|dEb85e07aa	just forget about him and call him to tell him that he is not invited to your party anymore.|`|v8ImtsaJaa	are you sure that he cheated on you if so then talk to him first and then if things go down hill then let him know..... it just doesn't seem right to me on cheating on some one.|`|buAj586Zaa	well i hope you broke up with him for cheating on you , and further more you need to tell him he's not invited nor is she .. its your party !|`|xsk9JWqpaa	SLAP HIM!!! haha jk but make him jealous at your party by dancing with a guy. either that or uninvite him|`|iDScOWBIaa	be careful who you let close to you.|`|NJrkgBaWaa	Brake up with him..|`|9YOW497Jaa	I wouldn't.|`|mJo35PwXaa	text him 2 say hes not invited kick him in the nuts if he does turn up|`|Yh0oQEPHaa	dump him and move on you idiot. anybody who's stays with a cheater is an absolute moron.

Well, idk what to tell u and im sorry for your pain!|`|BO28Mn8haa	uninvite him. and don't talk to the loser. don't be sad, be happy you found out now before things got any more serious with such a worthless piece of crap like him|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	You dump him and don't let him go to your party!|`|KFUsmwItaa	Uninvited him first off then act like he doesn't exist that's my advice.
pGv1NKCTaa	heyy, if i were you i'd let things cool down which it seems like theres been enough time to have happened, so tonight when he's just sitting and he looks relaxed and in a good mood i'd go and ask him for a word but before you ask him why he reacted the way he did, just say to him that you don't want an argument, that you just want to talk. Approach him like an adult and tell him that you would like to sort things out, but be sure to sound sincere and put in such a way that he can't think your being cocky and if possible have your mum in the room just incase things get tense. If he doesn't respond well don't let things boil into an argument but just tell him that you miss talking to him and your sorry if you upset him and then leave the room. after that its up to your dad to make an effort. don't worry, he will come around...over something this small, especially if you and your dad are close he surely wont hold a grudge. :)
CLFwZ3MBaa	what you can do is play her game back at her. tel her who she likes, and pick the uglist guys in the school....and if she tell you who you like say  " You can do better then that ". i expected something better from u . is this all you can come up with ? and then tell her you can go on and on but face the truth you are not in teretsed in your frinds taste for guy. as thats her taste not yours.|`|YfqG0gvSaa	Get serious, tell her to shut the **** up or you'll slap her<br>  <br>  nah kidding, just tell her that she is beggining to get on your nerves<br>  just be frank with her and tell her she is being childish|`|X9NZSBjqaa	You name the ugliest boy at your school and say loudly that she likes him. That should teach her a lesson|`|ILTKY48gaa	A really hot actor?<br>  No one can be hotter than that|`|QE2GKQWkaa	Start telling her who she likes, because I'm sure she likes someone and shes just teasing you to make herself not known to like someone.<br>  I used to tease people on who they liked but now I've changed and I look at that method "teasing who someone likes" as judging someone else.|`|f8fs6kycaa	Make her understand what u feel and if she's ur good fren and if she understand ur feelings then surely she will be with u...she will stop teasing...talk 2 her...dnt get angry wid her...
udPtqagzaa	He's probably either a) unsure about you and how he feels, or b) a very untrustworthy guy who probably messes people around.|`|zLGOQQs5aa	hes bipolar.|`|KFUsmwItaa	He may have been overwhelmed with stuff when he said that. Or maybe he text-ed to you by mistake. I have sent the wrong IM and e-mails before if you like him i wouldn't push it but if your bugged about be all means ask him but you could be bringing up trouble.|`|qlh1lz4Qaa	He probably just got mad and needed some time for himself. He got over it by himself so I would just leave it alone. My advice would be to join him and pretend it didnt happen. If you bring it up it will probably just cause more problems.|`|6CPFRnGraa	He was mad at the time he said he didn't want to talk to you (obviously, lol). But he's sorry that he said it and wants to keep contact with you.
8FbOtXAXaa	Weird! Maybe just slowly try to creep out the door and don't come back!|`|qoq9WlPxaa	lol just tell him he looks gay and it should deflate his ego a bit ;)|`|udPtqagzaa	Hah, whaaat? Tell him what you think of him- it'll soon reduce his ego a little.
0jUGSaZPaa	I think it's great!!<br>  You should either give them things in your wedding colors (the towels, flip flops, sun glasses) OR do their FAVORITE color..<br>  <br>  Some other suggestions to add:<br>  Why not a book?  For some of those who read, and would read on the beach...<br>  Or, some snacks...<br>  <br>  Have fun with it!!<br>  <br>  Give them 2 pairs of flip flops... One of your wedding colors (so they can wear them to the reception) and another pair that's their favorite color.|`|5DJcir9saa	I love that idea...mainly because I did pretty much the same thing!  I got married out of town at the beach so everyone who was there was going to be there for a long weekend.  So I got beach totes and filled it with beach towels, flip flops, magazines, pedicure set, and a couple little bottles of booze (we're drinkers..lol).  That way they had everything they needed for their weekend at the beach.<br>  <br>  BTW, they all loved it!|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	I am in agreement with others. I don't need another tote bag. I have flip flops, sunscreen, and beach towels already.<br>  <br>   Bridesmaid gifts don't all have to be the same. Why not get them something that fits their interests or different personalities?|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	It's perfect.  That's exactly what I did for my bridesmaids.|`|3e657243a606e14632ec806cc8f3adf1aa	I think it is a cute idea.|`|ACecbVghaa	A beach towel, flip flops, sun glasses and sun screen sound like things they probably already have or could get at a drug store. And personally, who really wants a personalized tote?! Perhaps you need to think along the lines of getting your friend something they would actually love and would not buy themselves. Why not upgrade your choices to things that are truly gifts and not drug-store fare: a pair of Stuart Weitzman or L.A.M.B sandals, nice Guess or D&G sunnies, some Keihl's summer skincare, a nice gold or silver anklet, and take them shopping for a new bikini each and put everything in a nice Kate Spade tote? That's something they won't tend to splurge on themselves and they will have the goods forever.|`|zsgHqrtEaa	I think that's perfect.  It is both personalized to your wedding theme, and is something they will be able to use again.|`|K542Db29aa	i think its great! very nice good luck to you and have fun :)|`|AA11143998	I think that is a great idea as long as all your bridesmaids like the beach.|`|BnJRwJiEaa	That's a good idea|`|9YWmMyT7aa	I really like it. I think you should do it|`|h3NJO9dWaa	that's a really cute idea, I like it.|`|03n14OLLaa	It sounds great to me|`|NH3LxNgNaa	I'm doing something similar for my bridesmaids.  I was able to get canvas totes from a seller on ebay (12 bags for $39.99 free shipping).  I was worried about the quality but when they arrived I was very surprised.  I couldn't afford to embroider 12 bags so I ordered iron-on transfers from a company in Canada.<br>  <br>  Their bags will include a embroidered fleece throw and goodies from Bath and Body Works (courtesy of their semi-annual sale and coupons)!!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|7u42U7raaa	That's a great idea. My wedding is in my home town (Las Vegas) and my MOH's have to travel to get here. We are getting a suite on the strip and I'm giving them a tote with pajama's and some fun vegas things.<br>  <br>  I always think, If its personal and true to you then it's perfect.|`|b2d2c070a260e4000775a62362f7a785aa	i think that would be great!! i would love it if i was one of them|`|ifgzHzA3aa	I know some people are not going to like my answer, but can we all please stop the embroidered tote bags?  Seriously, it may seem like the cutest, best idea, but more than not, people are not going to use them again.  Beach items on a budget are just not something that I would use.  Just my opinion.
ENkFZhlraa	She tells him that she can't go out with him because of her religion and not because of him, they can still be friends like. ;)|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Marry him.|`|DHFohlaeaa	Well, it depends on what religion she is. If she knows that she's doing the wrong thing, all that guilt on her shoulders should be enough and give her the strength to break up with him and move on. (but first she explains why she's breaking up with him) But, she could also tell her parents if she doesn't want to break up with him. Then she could get help from them, and tell them why she doesn't want to break up with him, but their probably going to tell her that she has to, since she was doing the wrong thing. <br>  <br>  **If she knew it was wrong, why did she say "Yes" to going out, anyways?!|`|ILTKY48gaa	If shes more scared than happy then I think the right thing to do is break up with the guy.<br>  She should tell him that its the religion and say she still wants to stay friends.<br>  Its not worth feeling scared over I guess because they can still stay close friends right?|`|8MGNpc5maa	I think if it makes her happy she should stick with the guy.<br>  I personally think she should stick with it. Maybe she'll get over the guilty feeling and be happy someone cares about her so much.|`|4iaswP8Kaa	Sorry to say, but when it comes to this kind of stuff put your religion aside.
AA10958272	Dating means -- him going OUT OF HIS WAY to entertain you.<br>  <br>  "I became concerned when we were sleeping in the same bed together almost every night and nothing physical was happening and I never felt like he wanted to be affectionate"<br>  <br>  ALL you were doing, was being around -- for whatever needs he had and listening to his dopey excuses. And pretending that you had a boyfriend, etc. etc. and ANY new guy would do the same thing to you -- because you're waaay too easy. Meaning you're just there. You HAVE to learn, to make them pursue you -- and show you some sacrifice without SAYING A THING or complaining. Otherwise, you end up wondering what "went wrong" when in fact -- nothing went anywhere.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	Too Long.<br>  <br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I dont think you are going to miss to much. you were never intamate and he IS going through a divorce and this is a time where he must be alone and figure out what it is he is looking for in life. you have already hurt him and he really has no feelings for you as of yet so I would say to let it go and find you someone with a more stable life who can keep a commitment.|`|1HTRWrawaa	Like you said he is going through a divorce and trying to keep his business going. This is the wrong time in his life to get involved with "anyone." He needs a lot of time to get over his wife and the failure of his marriage before he is emotionally ready to get on with his life and start a new relationship. As you said, he doesn't touch you when you sleep in his bed. <br>  <br>  The timing is all wrong for this relationship to ever have a chance. It's bound to fail. Like he told you, he's not ready to be emotionally involved with you (anyone). So I don't think your reason for going out with this other guy was really wrong. It's too bad you slipped and told him, but what is done, is done and you can't take it back. Being on the rebound when someone is getting a divorce is a bad place for you to be. Most people need at least a year or two to get through the divorce and get over what happened in the marriage, before they are emotionally ready to put all that a side and get on with their life. For some people it takes a lot more time then that.<br>  <br>  You need to let this relationship go, you are only setting your self up for a lot of stress and pain. Send him one last e-mail. Tell him you really care for him, but as he told you, he's going through a divorce, a lot of stress, and he's not emotionally ready to get involved with someone else at this time in his life. He needs time to get through this divorce and to heal from his failed marriage before he's ready to start a new life. The timing is wrong for the two of you and maybe some day in the future you will meet again and this relationship might have a chance. <br>  <br>  Now walk away. Don't e-mail, text, or call him again. Date other men and tell your self, from now on I won't get involved with someone who is going through a divorce or carrying around a lot of old baggage. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I wish the best for you.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	you didn't have an affair you only went out for dinner!!!<br>  your guy is already having trouble with women - he's divorcing one and now he feels he can't trust you.<br>  stress also is added to the mix with upholding his business.<br>  stress reduces anyone's desire in the bedroom.<br>  <br>  If you want this to work, then you have to communicate and really apologize, show him he's worth everything to you.<br>  But... as you said in the opening paragraph, you've only been going out with him for  just over 2 months and he said he was going through a divorce. His emotions are all over the place at this sensitive time.<br>  <br>  I can't blame him for ignoring you|`|LVlS4y7Caa	In order to move on, you have to be an adult and let go of something that wasn't yours to begin with...You screwed up and apologized profusely...let it go.  He's going through a lot and doesn't need a needy woman hanging on who wasn't up front to begin with.<br>  <br>  IF it's meant to be in time, there may be another chance - but he would have to contact you.  Don't throw yourself at a guy whose going through what he is, just let it be known you care for him, you're sorry and tell him you hope he will forgive you at some point - THEN LET IT GO...<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|iFAlZfVMaa	Ummmm... you just presented yourself with the solution.... "forget this and move on."  <br>  <br>  I hate to say but if you're THIS involved and invested after 2.5 months, you DO need to spend some quality time alone, investing in YOURSELF.  Do you realize that you've been away from this guy for a quarter of the time you were seeing him and you're this consumed by it?? <br>  <br>  YOU'RE GIVING IT MORE DRAMA TIME THAN IT'S WORTH.<br>  <br>  Walk away and call these few months a "lesson learned".|`|3M3htWrBaa	if he's fogiven you than forget about it|`|oIZnPGYnaa	HERE I AM ////HOLLAA BACK//// IM JUST A CLICK AWAY BOO!!!!|`|040115101fd4e24b2fd4488f18b7a9c9aa	you just have to realize that if you simply had dinner with this other guy and the guy you were dating could not accept that, he is too controlling, and he is controlling you even now to some extent or you wouldn't be wondering these things.  Try doing things to build up your own self esteem and don't worry about moving on until you are a stronger person and then you will make better choices perhaps and a better chance of finding someone who doesn't need your patience.|`|7SwfRs4Uaa	In the midst of this, it looks like when you "messed up" by going on this date (because at that point you decided that maybe this one wasn't for you due to reasons and wanting to see what is out there), but once you seen him get mad, you completely forgot about the fact that you weren't too sure if you wanted to be with him.<br>  <br>  I think that is what you need to figure out first.<br>  <br>  If you decide he is somebody you'd like to see what could happen with then, give him some time WITHOUT mentioning it. I know you two maybe haven't talked-talked about things even through your e-mails and texts. After some time, have a serious sit down with him and break it ALL down. He may be shaky on the fact you hid something from him and he isn't sure if he would want to continue a relationship with somebody he isn't positive he could trust. <br>  <br>  Now if you just want to move on, I would think that would be easy. When you were with him, you dated somebody. Now you two I guess aren't together. In reality there is no "easy" way to forget about somebody. Keep active. You have to let it fade on it's own.|`|AA11480266	OK look, you told him you apologized. Don't say it again, you have made yourself clear. Now truth be told, you like the guy more than you thought, maybe really like him. But the way to patch this up if it can be is to be strong, stronger than you thought you could ever be, meaning all or nothing, weekness on your part will kill the relationship. He's under stress because of his divorce and business, so the last thing he needs is more drama in his life. Stop calling him and emailing him for now, give it some time, send him a card (not a email) in a few weeks saying you’re still interested in seeing him and you understand what he must be going through. Leave it at that (the end). Than see if he responds, if he does start over from there. Good luck.|`|YXjuF6ppaa	Oh Honey, he's manipulating, using, and making you miserable after just 2 months? This guy is BAD NEWS.<br>  <br>  1) He had no right to assume you were exclusive, and you have nothing to apologize for, but since you already have, you're giving him the upper hand.<br>  <br>  2) If you're dating 2 months with almost no physical affection, run. It's not like it'll ever get better. <br>  <br>  3) The guy sounds like such a baby - a real man won't need to manipulate you and throw fits over what you do with your life. And he'll also tell you when he wants to commit, not expect you be psychic as well as celibate.<br>  <br>  I cannot even figure out why you're stessing over this guy. What a jerk.<br>  <br>  Good Luck though!|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	You were selfish to go out with the guy AND THEN say keep things open. <br>  Most marriages end because someone is being self because of sex or money, so you actions just reminds him of his soon to be ex-wife.<br>  <br>  Stop saying your sorry and try and have some fun.|`|YRRXtVXeaa	OH PLEASE!!! GO ASK JERRY SPRINGER OR DR PHIL|`|DRKzzw0Haa	You have a lot of things against you in your statement. One you wanted to see what else is out there. He isn't good enough so accept that. you went out with another guy. If he was the right guy you wouldn't have done it.  He is going on the rebound now and anything big or small will upset him. Stop apologizing. It's useless. How to forget him? Go out shopping with friends, read a good book, watch a funny movie, go out to a bar all dressed to the nines and go home alone. Leave your phone off the hook for three days. Think of yourself as his temporary replacement wife and know that it's a waste of time to try and pursue him now.|`|tZGc8JRuaa	Sounds like you have become very attached to this guy. If you weren't it would be much easier to move on and enjoy life. Understand I don't tell people what they should do because I don't know what is right for someone else. However, it seems to me you are someone who just wants to be happy. I would recommend moving on and enjoy life. people get to hung up on what they have been told how relationships are suppose to be. Life isn't perfect and neither are people. People make mistakes. If he can't see that move on. Learn from your past mistake and get on with living.

If he really cares and wants to be with you, then he will clean up his act and try to win you over.  If you go chasing after him, you are giving him exactly what he wants - easy sex without any comittment.|`|0LwNYEUdaa	If everyone says he's a player then he is.

DHFohlaeaa	Well, I agree with all of the other people that answered your question. You should so tell! If she's bullying other people, then she wouldn't know which one of the by-standers told. You could go to the Principal of your school and tell him/her all of the mean things she's done to you. And if you have the time/money, you could get a video camera, post it up somewhere in your school where Jessa goes a lot, and then you would have physical proof that she's being mean to you and other kids. <br>  <br>  And in my school/state, if you are physically/verbally bullying people, and it hurts them deeply, then off you go to Juvie, or you get In School Suspension, or Out Of School Suspension. So, Jessa would be out of your life for forever! (or at least the bullying part! =]) <br>  <br>  So I really suggest that you tell someone. Maybe one of/both of your parents, a teacher that is close to you, or the Principal of your school. And what about Jessa's parents? I wonder how they will react when they find out what Jessa's been doing to you/other kids. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope that my answers will help you! =]|`|QE2GKQWkaa	You need to be firm with her, and give her "the look"(you know, the mean one). If that doesn't work try to answer her with questions and if she touches you, you have to tell the dean of your school. You don't want to hit her because she will be able to tell on you so you have to tell.<br>  That's how I had gotten rid of my bully.|`|Efonm1znaa	I thought school was about learning. My sister does this constantly. It drives my parents insane. You have you're whole life ahead of you to do this stuff with boys.

Good Luck!|`|DtUy1IFmaa	Is she the type that would hit you?  If she's not then I would tell her off.  In fact, I'd let her know just how many people don't like her and how everyone is fake with her.  Let her know that she can say or do all the pathetic little sh*t she does already all she wants because in the end she's the one that nobody likes and she's the one that looks like an immature loser.  Honestly, she sounds like a loser who's probably socially awkward.  I mean.. putting a bag on your foot?  Who does that?  Tell her to grow the F**k up and get a life that doesn't involve you.  Otherwise just ignore her.  She's so desperate for attention its sad.

And then that's it. But you have to say it playfully. It was probably just a joke or you're really at the bottom. It also means that she starts at the bottom and works her way up. As in....you're first!!|`|xsk9JWqpaa	im sure she was just trying to get a reaction out of u. dont sweat it but keep a close eye on how she acts around u. if shes really shy and doesnt want to b touched then just ask if she wants to break up but if she is the same like i said dont sweat it|`|FF5AeHvqaa	Yeah thats HARSH!<br>  Maybe she was joking???<br>  Think you should find out, Else jog on and find yourself a nice girlfriend who has some respect for you!<br>  =^..^=|`|oRUG4VbJaa	maybe she'd put them before you?.. or maybe she meant it sexually?.. who knows you just got to ask her only she knows what she meant exactly.. but that dont sound like it meant something good.. i'd put my man first before sweets,....|`|71c9254c6a01fc64077ec03916ee1ba5aa	i think that was her way to put you down, if she starts acting weird maybe you should ask her if she is wanting to stay in the relationship... sorry that girls can be soo mean|`|udPtqagzaa	If she wasn't joking, that's a bit harsh.

fox5a3ePaa	Maybe you should try hypnotherapy|`|884f83163d9d5ff77266c433b41779baaa	you sound depressed which is why you obviously don't want to talk to any visitors.The longer this illness goes on the harder it is to combat. If you can't get the help you crave you will have to have great determination and courage to help yourself. You have to set very small goals for yourself.e.g. tomorrow i will open the front door and look out.The next day i will put one foot outside the front door, the day after both feet outside the front door.Keep a positive mantra in your head. e.g. I will do this for my children.or one step to a new life, or i can do this. Have you ever considered hypnotherapy? Don't think of suicide an agoraphobic mum is better than no mum at all.Call the samaritans if things are really that bad.You need to work on your self esteem and keep positive thoughts in your head. I'm know that is easier said than done but i wish you luck.|`|fce67c6faf9b1d4b041b262e35a15d36aa	Ohhh you should go back and see the doctor .. maybe this time get some anti depresents or something ..Good luck Xxx
dPk7dr7laa	Ok, if you knew he was married when you were with him then you didn't care about her feelings then. <br>  <br>  But... No do not ignore her call. She needs this for closure. Just take the call and don't go into detail unless she asks specific questions like "did he kiss you?" or "did he talk about me or were you guys just talking about everyday things while together?" You don't have to give details about what he said to you that was nasty about her. Just tell her "yes, he said some mean things about you" and leave it at that. She needs this to move on. She needs the whole truth. Give her that. If you care about her feelins now then allow her this opportunity to get the closuer she needs. I am sure once the phone call is over she will never call you again and you will prolly have 2nd thoughts about doing this ever again (being with a married man) Think about if it were you this happneed to and you needed the closure. Just be gracious to her and don't skip blame. Say you are sorry and you have learned a lesson from this.|`|10227ea57ca1a432558caaf5ed576d9caa	These things always end in a mess.  You don't sound the least bit sorry for getting involved with a married man.  I suppose you fell for all teh my wife doesn't understand me or she has gone off sex or she nags me balony.  Maybe just maybe he should ahve sat down and listened to her speak, think of ways he might renew the relationship with her instead of trawling around with you.  You don't want to hurt her......maybe you should of thought of that before you indulged his fantasy.  I hope she screws for as much money as she can  big time.<br>  <br>  I cannot imagine what you might say to her.  Pathetic.|`|3bf6bf2fa95deff37a266b5813651ca7aa	You chose to be a home wrecking wh*re so I suggest you be an adult and own up to what you did. Not only do you deserve to have your a** chewed out, you deserve to get your a** beat. If i were his wife I would have found you and beat the living sh*t out of you, until the point of hospitalization. How the hell can you do that to someone? How would you feel if your husband was cheating on you? KARMAS a B*tch and what goes around comes around. Sooner or later it will catch up to you and I hope you feel the exact same way your "lovers" wife feels, only 10 times worse.  Also, what makes you think that if he cheated on his WIFE, he won't cheat on you too? What makes you think he won't get sick of you? You should use your head!!!!!|`|Py3kFnDyaa	you should have thought about how she feels when you were with her man!! thats just wrong number one and you were cheating on him the past 2 months anyways?? well just be a woman and answer the call. admitt to your mistakes! it may hurt you or her but its for the better! both of you were in the wrong place and didnt realize how many people can get hurt!|`|0LvWiESWaa	I would talk to her only if she's being civil. She probably needs to know the truth and by rights, you need to answer for your actions. <br>  <br>  Do the right thing.|`|uI4Dspi4aa	You don't want to hurt her feelings? I think you already did that by sleeping with her husband.|`|czghHtzXaa	TELL THE ***** HOW TO TAKE CARE OF A MAN|`|f9crUDTwaa	Don't answer ... leave the woman alone ... you interfered in her marriage .. she didn't do anything to you .|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I think you owe her the right to let her speak her mind, you can simple listen and then hang up when it is over.  This will make her feel better and you will have done your service, part of the treatment that most mistresses get on occasions.  I think you would benefit now that you have an additional boyfriend, to keep the old one on the side, he will now hopefully have additional money until the divorce is finalized.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	If you want to do something really nice for the guy, tell her that he never would have strayed if she had been a better wife.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	Personally I wouldn't believe the stuff he said about you but if you do answer you will get to hear the lies he has told her about you. lol or truths.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	You should read the book "He's Just Not That Into You".

q8eue7CRaa	They should give you the dresses back, and you return then and keep the money.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	Well, ethically they should return the dresses to you, since they are no longer participating in the wedding.  But, to play Devil's Advocate, it was a gift from you to them.  After the wedding, are you making the other girls give their dresses back?|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Oh no...  <br>  <br>  I would definitely tell them to either a.) return the dress and give you the money or b.) give you the dress.<br>  <br>  That was sweet of you to pay, but now you may be screwed...  Depending on how your friends are....<br>  <br>  I would hope they would be mature enough and do the right thing...<br>  <br>  Just simply call them and ask them politely.  Don't get into a scream fest, because then you'll never see the the money!!<br>  <br>  Good luck, sweetie... Hope you get the $$ back....|`|u4910BFfaa	If they are not going to be in the wedding they should return the dresses to you period.  You paid for them and if you need to add another person you could have them possibly use them.  The idea of them thinking they could take them to a store and get a refund when they never paid is nuts.  Tell them they need to bring the dresses back or hey, just show up at their house if it might be a problem.  Just show up and say, hey can I get that dress?|`|bf6K6uubaa	i can't imagine friends being like that so i wonder their age...anyway its your money but i'd just let it go if you don't need the money super badly...also if they see it as you giving them the dresses they might not want to give them back...just think about it this way..they lost your friendship for 60 bucks....|`|gPlUDaRoaa	The right thing for them to do is give them back to you.Call them & tell them you want the dress back,Don't worry about what they may think or feel,hey,they were the one's to bail on you.|`|VMY7No0eaa	THEY SHOULD GIVE THE DRESSES TO YOU.<br>  You are the one who bought them!<br>  If you made them buy the dresses they might not have bailed on you because they put some money into it!|`|xuiSfzgraa	The right thing to do would be for them to return them to you as you paid for them.  If they are truly your friends that is what they will do as I am sure they understand that your wedding is costing you money and you can use all that you can get.  If they return them on their own to get YOUR money, that just shows you what kind of people they are, and you should be greatful that they are not standing up for you on your special day.|`|BnJRwJiEaa	It doesn't matter how much you paid for the dresses they are your dresses you brought them.  They weren't your friends in the beginning if they were they wouldn't  do something so stupid.  I would ask for all the dresses back and take the refund and use it for the new ones.  Please try to chose your friends wisely.  If the 2 girls don't give you the dresses back then go press charges on them and I guarantee they will give them back.|`|5DJcir9saa	They need to return the dress to you.  Those gifts were given to them and in return they were supposed to participate in your wedding.  Because they are no longer in the wedding, they need to return the dresses.  <br>  <br>  It sucks when things like this happen.  My MOH ditched out on me the night before my wedding...Luckily she had paid for her own dress.|`|I7QcHkLFaa	They should return the dress to you so you can get your money back<br>  If there is something that they did to the dress that you can not return it they should reimburse you.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	they should give them back to you! thats ridiculous not only are they inconveniencing you but theyre being ridiculous it wasnt a gift it was a dress to wear in your wedding, and a favor so they wouldnt have to buy them themselves.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	yes if they are not going to be on the wedding partythen they should give them back to you asap...i cant believe they didnt even ask you abut that..<br>  <br>  you should give them a call and ask for the dresses...|`|9YWmMyT7aa	they should return it to you, so you get YOUR money.|`|Ce3glk6Faa	You paid for them so they should return them to you as they are no longer in the wedding as your brides maids.|`|b2d2c070a260e4000775a62362f7a785aa	since you bought them, you should have them returned to you!
Hh4BORyzaa	Yeah definitely.  I have a church already in line for my wedding and we are not having a religious wedding.  We are doing just maybe a 15 minute wedding, with the vows, I dos, and kiss the bride.  Call around to different churches to ask them if they do let you rent out their church.  In my town, there is only one church that you can rent out without having to be a member of that church. <br>  <br>  I've noticed a lot of people asking why you want to have a wedding in a church if you don't want it to be religious.  I'm a Christian and am a religious person, but don't attend church and would just like a wedding to be short and sweet without a sermon during the wedding.  I have been to several weddings where the preacher not only did the traditional things, but also performed a sermon which made the wedding long and pretty much took away from the celebration of the two joining their lives together.|`|7HVsVspOaa	Try historic churches owned by the county or historical society.<br>  <br>  Try Unitarian Universalist Fellowships.<br>  <br>  Try "congregational" churches. Churches that are not supported by a large parent church and are member supported are often more likely to rent space. They may request to see the ceremony content, but should have no problems with a civil ceremony. I have had difficulties in the past with couples who wanted Pagan elements.<br>  <br>  Universities sometimes have Interfaith Chapels for rent. <br>  <br>  With that said may I suggest that since you really have no connection to the idea of a church other than it being "traditional", you consider mansions, museums and other formal settings. I think they may offer the feel you are looking for but fit your beliefs a little better. Plus it will broaden your base of things to look at as far as your options go.|`|Gem96NQyaa	I've never seen "preaching" at a wedding, beyond the mention of god during traditional vows.<br>  <br>  But as far as churches go, it will depend a lot on which religion.  Catholic churches will almost never allow a church wedding for someone who isn't Catholic or converting Catholicism.  Other denominations are less strict.<br>  <br>  You're probably just going to have to go to your local churches and ask.  It's entirely at their discretion.  A non-denominational church would be your best bet.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	Hahaha, I don't even know how to answer this question without being rude...<br>  <br>  I can't even explain how disrespectful you question is.  A church just isn't a pretty building.  And the priest/reverend doesn't just marry people in their church for fun.<br>  <br>  Either welcome God into your life or consider getting married somewhere secular.|`|884v4VhGaa	Getting married in a church is only traditional because having a church wedding is traditional. There's lots of pretty buildings that aren't churches, and as was mentioned, there's a lot of former churches which can be rented out. <br>  <br>  Some churches might rent the building out, but you're not going to have a lot of luck trying to have a church ceremony that isn't a proper church wedding, including references to God and the pastor doing interviews with you beforehand. It's possible, but seeing how as you don't attend a church, you aren't going to know which ones don't care about marriages.|`|tGEHK7TTaa	I don't fully understand why you want to get married in a church without wanting there to be any religion associated with it, however, there are wedding chapels that can be rented out, and usually can be provided with non religious officiant.  I don't know where you are located, but there are few in Southern California I can think of off the top of my head.  <br>  <br>  Most churches require you to either be a member of the church or at least have some sort of premarital counseling before the officiant will marry you.  If you find a church that you like the style of you can always ask what their policy is and if you can bring your own officiant and just hire someone who is not religious.|`|8QoNSvp6aa	i would say your best bet is to scour the yellow pages for non denominational churches  they just see god as god no specific belief system  however the only snag i see you running into with a church ceremony is most churches request the participants of the marriage be <br>  members of the church at least a year prior to meeting with the priest<br>  your other choices are a justice of the piece from a courthouse or a self ordained minister  hope that helps|`|b1xQKDEraa	why would you want to marry in a church if you dont like what a church represents? I think you dont understand what a church ceremony is all about and it is a little hypocritical to say you dont want a religious ceremony i a church!<br>  <br>  anyway you can have lovely civil ceremonies in beautiful locations, not just in a registry office. search google for wedding venues i your area.|`|662f484d424f72f2a33ec7fc2ec39c16aa	What about a historical church that is not used at a place of worship, such as at a historical village? I think it is kinda rude to go to someones place of worship, and ask to use their Church your way. Google historical villages in your area. Example Old Sturbridge Village, Mass. or Allaire Village, NJ|`|ACecbVghaa	So you want to use God's house but you don't want him involved? That's very sad. Instead of using the church under false pretenses perhaps you should have a civil ceremony.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	If you aren't religious, don't waste the Church's time. It is a house of worship, not a pretty backdrop. Do you have any clue how disrespectful that is?|`|dPULl5hjaa	Try these churches:  Methodist, Presbyterian, Lutheran - call the preacher's and ask if he/she would perform the ceremony and tell them want type you want.   It's worth a try.

I'm paying 3,000 k for my wedding but that includes the honeymoon, the reception for 30/40 ppl, and ceremony for about 10 ppl. Usually, your budget will dictate how many people to invite. Or in my case it did. For 200 people in a small-medium metro city a budget from 5,000-12,00 is deemed "normal." If you wanted all of the bells and whistles at top of the line it can be 20,000.|`|ACecbVghaa	You budget what you can afford.

We are spending more than the "average" $25k because we a) can afford it and b) know what we want. People do amazing things on large and small budgets so your best bet is to figure out what works for YOU.|`|03n14OLLaa	You can spend anywhere from 2,000 to 100,000 dollars on a wedding.

With that my cost of my hall and catering was about $12,000 but for somebody with a budget of $50,000 their catering price could be my whole wedding budget.

LVlS4y7Caa	I believe it is reasonable in these troubled times, to sit back and evaluate uprooting one's family for a job, rather, he should commute for at least 6 months to a year before the two of you hastily move...It is, only an hour away, yeah, gasoline is expensive, but what about stability?  Living in a good community with friends and family and a life?  Are they to be ignored for a job?  I do not think so.<br>  <br>  We went through the same thing early on, thank God my Mr. Wonderful commuted a year and one half before we moved, made all the difference in the world as to how we both viewed it and how we uprooted ourselves and adjusted.  We needed time to think,both of us, and that year and one half allowed that, for the both of us.  I can't imagine a loving man doing less than that...I'd ALSO let him know, this is the last time if you do move what with the surges in the the economy and COST of housing and moving around, it ISN'T as easy as it use to be...Would this new company move you two?  Probably not...THAT MATTERS.  Is housing more or less?  THAT MATTERS.

He is .|`|pOTigVYPaa	Tell your husband you and your child are staying put right where you are.  At first he might think a bachelor pad is great, but missing you and his child will really suck.  He'll come around to your way of seeing it.  If being a gypsy is really in his blood, may I suggest he get a career as a long haul trucker?|`|fDOSnGpwaa	An hour away you say? It's not that far, just tell him to drive. If the jobs that good and he really cares about you he'll do it. I'm only 17 myself and my dad drives an hour to get to work, so I know it works.<br>  <br>  That extra money will cover the gas also.|`|tG1vTi0Daa	The woman is spose to go where the man goes. Pack your bags and go with him. You dont have a choice, hes the head.|`|7SwfRs4Uaa	3 times in 9 years... not bad. My boyfriend and I have lived together for 2 years and have moved 4 times. Could be worse is all I am saying!<br>  <br>  BUT I completely understand what you're saying and why you would feel that way. Already twice you gave it to moving more because he wanted to, but partially because you didn't completely mind. Now, enough is enough. Given your reasons (besides you "just not wanting to") you have very solid reasons. <br>  <br>  Bringing this up may cause a fight even if you try your hardest for it not to. But it's always hard for two people, who want the other one to feel or at least agree to what they want, won't ever go too well. One person USUALLY looses. Unless, you find a compromise.<br>  <br>  I can see he may this this pad of his would be a compromise, but that in itself would bring other problems - not spending enough time with you and his son (which is a REALLY BIG THIS... 8 days a month he would spend with his father), jealousy, possible trust issues, etc.<br>  <br>  His career is obviously very important to him, but he needs to think where his priorities stand... family ... career.|`|hSY0LuCOaa	He obviously doesn't care what's best for you and your son. tell him you're not moving and he's not getting a bachelor pad in town (it's called a bachelor pad for a reason). Maybe he just needs another outlet for his adventurism? It might help him to travel some, or do some sort of slightly dangerous sport (like surfing or rockclimbing or something) Either way, uprooting you constantly and your son to feed his wanderlust is not ok, it's just selfish of him.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Hmm, if he is the way you describe him, then this isn't the last time when the question of moving will arise. When someone wants to move just to move, rational arguments won't help. Of course he can commute for an hour; most people in big cities probably spend 30 min -1 hr one way commuting to work each day. The problem is not that he has a bad job or that the commute is too long - the problem is that he just wants to pick up on a moment's notice and go live someplace else, whether it makes practical sense or not. All this talk about a "bachelor pad" is probably a manipulative move designed to get you to cave in. I don't know what the solution is here. You married a guy who can't stay in the same place for any length of time; it's understandable that you thought he might "grow roots" once you settle down and start a family, but it often doesn't go down this way - people don't change easily, and they don't change in ways we want them to. He remains the same guy that you married - restless and in need of a change of scenery every few years; there's no escape from this conclusion. You can fight and you can argue, but if he's adamant about this lifestyle, eventually you will need to choose between him and your preferred lifestyle. You'll either have to accept that you'll be moving several more times throughout the years, or stand firm on your decision to stay where you are, and see what gives. Moving is not necessarily bad for the child - military families move all the time, and it doesn't automatically result in dysfunctional kids. My husband grew up in a Navy family who moved around every 2-3 years, and he is a very well adjusted individual; if anything, he credits his resourcefulness, resilience to stress, and adaptability to the constantly changing environment of his childhood (among other things). Sure, marriage takes compromises, but sometimes the person who needs to compromise may be you.<br>  <br>  P.S. Just for the record, I agree with you completely that it makes logical sense to stay where you are now. All I'm saying is that for your husband it seems to be an emotional thing that has nothing to do with logic - and so it will be hard to reason with him.|`|f9crUDTwaa	Your husband doesn't get it . Many people need stability . Children need stability . For his families sake , he needs to rethink this way of life and learn to stay in one place . You two can move around again when your children are grown . If your husband won't see this , you'll need counseling . <br>          Hopefully he'll realize , he's not single anymore. It's not just about him . It's about him ,a wife and a child ,who also have lives and need roots .
ifIW4vuqaa	It's probably nothing you've done. In fact, you're probably just a scapegoat right now. I'm in a situation similar to this. My mother thinks I'm the greatest disappointment in the world...but I don't know why. To be honest, I don't think she has a reason not to be proud of me. I'm in college, and I'm a strong young woman. Eventually you just have to realize that despite the fact that they are your parents, the only person who has a say in WHO you ARE is yourself, and if you don't mind yourself, then they shouldn't either, and it's pathetic that they don't see that. I hope it gets better. It's hell to deal with.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	You aren't doing anything wrong, your parents are.Tell your parents that verbal abuse is not going to help the situation and maybe, just maybe because school is so hard for you (at 13, this should not be the case) you might have a learning disorder, and you want to be tested immediately.|`|9w2VFZZFaa	bless u try ignring and try to take them down and sit and tell them u feel  upset|`|pGv1NKCTaa	this sounds really similar to my parents, iam 17 and i dont get on with my dad in the slightest, but he still loves me, both my parents do. dont look at the way that they are talking to you as their hatred because deep down they only want your best interests. when you get homework, sometimes do it infront of them so they can see that you are trying...the most you can do in life is try your best, no one can ask more of you? maybe if your struggling at school you could ask them for a tutor, or for them to help you with your work? that way they definately can see that you do want to do well in school. talk to your parents about the problems and together try and find a resolution. and about your dad saying that your going to end up a druggie on the streets, well show him your not by working your socks off. My dad and myself have a rocky relationshipp and have done since i was 7 and he has always tried to put me down but ive used those criticisms to further motivate me in doing well...dont let anyone put you down in life, just try your best :)|`|NAyIbRb0aa	my son had the same problem with his dad always calling him a loser and he would not amount to nothing. It is not you your dad has a problem. You have to remember you are a bright and intellent young man and no one can change that. Sit down with your mom and tell her how you are feeling that might help <br>  If not go to your counselor at school and talk to that person they might be able to give you some information and maybe help you out<br>  don't fight with them it only makes it worse<br>  Bless you and remember you are a great person

xMH8ka45aa	i went through close to the same thing, just flipped. I was in love with this girl who i was living with in college (i lived in a house with 5 girls) she got raped, hurt by countless guys, parents disowned her, lost her job, kicked out of school, everything. well by the second week we lived together we were best friends and she told me everything, and i was there for her through everything. i never told her i loved her until one drunken night during a heart to heart. we hooked up for the first time but she didnt even remember it. then she told me that nothing could ever happen it would be to weird we were to good of friends she didnt want to ruin anything, all of that. and i told her i would not give up but will settle for being her friend for now, sure enough a few weeks later we hooked up again and we started dating. at first it was weird, especially sexual things, sex was alright but foreplay was so hard to get used to seeing eachother like that. Now weve been dating for 10 months and life has been great. sure we have our ups and downs, but we love eachother, we know EVERYTHING about eachother so theres no past secrets, and that makes it easier not to keep secrets from each other.

Why on earth would you invite yourself?  This is his deal, not yours and if he wants you to go, he'll let you know.  You sound like someone that guys like to break up with because you try to micromanage their lives.  Don't do that. Trust him until you find out otherwise.  Tell him to have a good time, and mean it.  If he chose not to take someone, he obviously doesn't want someone else along.  Not a problem.  Leave it alone.  He has his reasons and I doubt it is because he invited someone else along.  He wants to relax and not be micromanaged on this cruise.  I don't blame him--it's a chance to bond with work people, maybe network and move up the administrative ladder.  I can totally understand him wanting to be on his own for this.  He sure will be in meetings all day and the group will be setting goals and objectives that will steer the company into a very tough economic year.  He wants to focus.  I say back off and he will be more drawn to you....<br>  Hope this helps, even if it isn't what you want to hear....
meOA1nEUaa	Damn that is sexy. I love my cousin's feet and wish i could do that to her! I have to settle for her shoes. maybe next time she sleeps over i'll try worshipping her feet while asleep. so you find stains in your heels? maybe he leaves it in there so you could see it or feel it i do it sometimes its such a turn on. Just let him have his fun believe me he is very lucky, not many of us foot fetish guys have that opportunity! and hes not hurting anyone and you did mention it felt good so let him enjoy your sexy feet while hes there. maybe even let him know you like it and it can be your special little thing between you two! Love your name by the way, girls named Ivonne are always sexy.|`|b5ee8c09e3810b58aedf226def571615aa	i would have kicked his face if i were you<br>  <br>  btw you should tell him because thats not going to help him in anyway if he continues that s.hit. seriously thats freaking creepy.<br>  <br>  and he needs to get out and make friends. sure people can be shy with girls and whatnot but he should at least have friends|`|UsJDUm1Haa	ok thats kinda creepy lol. but if i were you then i would put a stop to it because you dont want him to take it farther. buy him a fake foot lol :]|`|kkVHXm1Kaa	talk to him and be like were family just tell me whats going on and tell him not to touch you at the end of that because your family and that is creepy|`|S7UWlOz7aa	You know the answer to that.|`|WfxpiomNaa	dude thats effin gross!|`|qoq9WlPxaa	lol your cousin? for real? O.o Im pretty sure that is incest.|`|tkPBNBhiaa	I don't think you should tell him, and if you do he'll be extremely embarrassed and won't know what to say, don't believe what other people say, it isn't incest if he isn't having sex with you, believe me, I have a foot fetish and I used to give my aunts foot massages all the time, and sometimes do other foot fetish things that I won't explain in detail since some people think it's eww. But anyway let him have his fun, what more do you have to lose? You're enjoying it, and he sure is enjoying it. So go ahead and let him do his thing.|`|6lmFyr2maa	just confront him next time you catch him doing weird stuff with your feet again.<br>  <br>  if you bring it up know he'll only wonder why you didnt stop him at the time (he may become under the impression you like it because you let him carry on).<br>  <br>  so yeah in the meantime just pretend to be oblivious to it.<br>  <br>  xxx|`|zLGOQQs5aa	next time he does it be like "wtf?!?!?!?" and thats disgusting! HES YOUR ******* COUSIN!!!!!|`|aIp8kKo5aa	Honestly its up to you if you wanna put up with it lol. Kinda gross really, I mean he is your cousin after all. If it really bothers you bring it up to him or wear socks lol. If you keep just letting him do it, hes gonna think its okay to take it even further one day. So be smart about it.|`|JCdBSULraa	Lol, buy him a pair of heels and/or find him a girl who's into that stuff.   Then tell him to stay away from you in the future.  Then make sure you both understand to never speak of it again and pretend it never happened.|`|KFUsmwItaa	Lock your door that is really really creepy.|`|f1Unp3fBaa	It's all up to you.
HIMwyeZqaa	The bank will sell it super cheep and then you will still owe the remainder of your mortgage.  Only then you will not have your house.  Perhaps you-all can divide up the week on who is restricted to one room.  Many ways to do it.  One way is to let one person choose 3 days to have all the house except one room with the other person getting 4 days with the house less one room.  If your parents are close by, you-all could take turns living with your mommies and daddies.<br>  If you all could turn it into 2 apartments, then you would each have their own place but that would cost thousands of dollars.|`|f9crUDTwaa	Don't do it yourself ... get an attorney . He can counsel you and you husband about the financial necessities that you need to look at . If you and your husband agree about everything the divorce will be cheap even with a lawyer . An attorney only needs an hour or two to set up your paperwork for a divorce .|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	You can do a deed in lieu of foreclosure.  It would hurt your credit just like if you let a car go back...sell the house and split the proceeds.<br>  As far as the DIY divorce websites, I wouldn't trust them at all.  They are not state-specific, and with you having real estate issues, there is a high likelihood of you screwing it up.  Spend the money and get an attorney.|`|SHARt1k3aa	You can give the house back.  It's called deed in lieu of trust.  They'll simply take the house back.  Will it ding your credit?  Most likely.  But, what's more important, your sanity, or a ding to the credit.  Get out and chalk it up as a loss.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Talk to the bank about giving it back. A mutually agreeable divorce can be done without lawyers. You just go to the courthouse and file the necessary papers. The clerk can tell you which forms are required.|`|lFR1YxzSaa	You can't just give it back to the bank. You can sell it for what you owe or "short sale".|`|UAE8ca5laa	There is something called "deed in lieu of foreclosure" where you essentialy give the bank the keys and walk away.  But with banks drowning in bad loans right now they may not want to do this and it is way bad on your credit,  I would urge 1 of you to consider contacting your lender about loan modification where 1 of you could keep the house and buy the other out,  Then get a roomate to help out with the payments..|`|7yW3UUN4aa	I am not aware how much you have spent [not wasted] for going through a lawyer but you will appreciate that a person seeking medical treatment wont go to a lawyer and similarly, a person seeking legal help wont go to a doctor. The money spent [not wasted] in seeking help of experts of a particular field will always help finding proper and best solution.|`|ma36UfpBaa	lol, I don't think any bank are accepting houses back right now!|`|dPk7dr7laa	My answer is don't get a divroce. Watch the movie FireProof. Seriously. You loved him at one time. There were things that made you fall in love and think he was the best thing since sliced bread. What were those things. DOn't think about all the fights you have had or all the names you have clled each other. Take an hour and write down all the things you thought were wonderful at one time about him. Watch the movie (with him or alone at first) and make it work. Don't do a drastic thing like divorse. unless he is physically hurting you everyday and will not entertain the thought of stopping then you need to go back to the place where you were when you decided to marry him. Look at old photos of you guys together and your wedding album. Talk to him about what made him fall in love with you back then. Go on a date tonight. Go to the Olive Garden for dinner or ask him to a later lunch this afternoon and talk about all this and tell him what you wrote or just give him the thinsg you wrote and let him read it. Allow yourself to cry and be vulnerable. You did love him at one time. Find that love again. Afterall "Love is an action" not a feeling. We need to constantly Do to love and that is how you keep your marriage alive and loving.|`|f36bb855b6fe4f58fc6b6148329e13a6aa	Well you can both move out and rent the house out but if the house isn't rented you are both responsible for the mortgage. Yes you can let it go back, and yes for a minimum of 7 years there will be a mark on your credit. You can get the paperwork online and file ProSe, but it is best to get an attorney. <br>  <br>  Sounds to me like you just need to file a start the battle. The courts can force the sale of the home, and although you may not sell for full market value, you might at least get enough to pay off the mortgage. You are in a serious pickle, and there are no easy answers. <br>  <br>  What you have to truly ask yourself is how badly do I want out? What am I willing to sacrifice and do in order to achieve that goal? You may not like your answers, but sometimes the short term sacrifice is a much easier pill to swallow than the long term insanity.|`|sgkvXvNTaa	You can give it back, but it will be considered a foreclosure and it will greatly impact your credit score. However, credit hardly seems worthy of your happiness. Perhaps you could call the mortgage company and tell them that you are on the verge of divorce and that you need to renegotiate your payment for one that you two could afford until you are able to sell the house. This is a tough spot, but credit or not you will get through it and happiness is key in my opinion! <br>  <br>  In most states an uncontested divorce is very inexpensive so that part should be easy. Look in your local newspaper in the classifieds for a local divorce attorney; it should not be that expensive at all.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!

nCWjdyddaa	The brother's part of the estate would not pass to his family if:<br>  The estate had not yet been probated; and<br>  The bequest does not specifically say to the brother or his heirs.<br>  <br>  However, it would be up to the Executor to decide how this should be handled. Frankly, it would be very nice if the heirs could agree to allow the brother's part of the estate to pass to his family. But, unfortunately, families aren't often this reasonable when it comes to money. I hope yours is.

Just because the new one seems somewhat interested, doesn't mean he's any better than your bf. Always consider when making a decision in life , how would you feel if it happened to you If you break up with bf on your own, then ok, but don't do it for what you think is greener pastures. Most times that greener pasture isn't what it appears and you could be losing something that's very important to you. Good luck with your decision, but be careful!|`|ActoZyHraa	Ask yourself who the better option is, if you really like your boyfriend stay true to him && continue dating but if you have stronger feelings for the other one then break it off with your bf ^_^|`|8P6MmLv0aa	If you are happy with your boy friend then tell the others to but out.|`|zZrKhn9eaa	Your friends aren't the ones dating your boyfriend. You are. You shouldn't be second guessing your boyfriend simply because other people are forcing their opinion on you. Tell them to get a life.<br>  Now, if you really aren't interested in your guy anymore then maybe you should dump him. But this is where you have to dig deep and forget what everyone else says. Do YOU still have eyes for just your boy. And don't let people on Y!A tell you exactly what to do. Sure, it may be okay to take someone's advice, but don't just think "Okay, they said dump him so that's what I'm going to do." And were you thinking about breaking up with him before your friends said anything? Were things perfectly fine before people started messing with your head, or were you guys already having some serious problems? Those are some questions you might want to ask yourself.<br>  Another thing to consider, which I have also already seen in some answers, is the other boy very well may be screwing with you. Boys do that, they even admit it (no offense guys).<br>  <br>  My little sister was constantly talking about her boyfriend. "He wrote me a song... We hold hands... He gave me a gold bracelet with my name inscribed on it.." I was SO happy for her. And then one of her  'close' friends got the idea in her head that he simply wasn't an adequate boyfriend. So she dumped him. Just like that.. didn't even talk to him. I didn't talk to him myself, but I heard that he was completely crushed. I was pretty pissed.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	Well make a checklist of both of the two guys, see who has more points.Also, why are you considering the other guy, is it because of his looks. Looks can only get a peron so far in life. If your boyfriend is treating you good and takes care of you emotionally, physically and so forth, then stay with him.|`|EP2TZWYEaa	any body that says that you should dump your bf or gf isnt worth it because all they about is them selves and they dont care how they make other people feel. wat you should do is stay with the person that you are with (if he cares about you) and if anything ever happends between you and your bf then at least you know that there is someone waiting for you??|`|uP0ydiO1aa	umm you can do one of two things, dump him go out with the other guy but maybe hes just joking around and if you dump ur bf now then he wont want to go out later. and two, keep seeing your bf and just ignore the other guy.|`|SR1FN2nqaa	do what makes you happy without hurting anyone in the process. if i listened to everyone that had a thought of what i should do id be soooo confused. follow your own heart.|`|Sm2MzPDuaa	dump him, you obviously don't like him or respect him.|`|R4wEzQZ2aa	Do what you want to do because it is yur life and other people should not be making desisons for you !|`|6h30kGjDaa	go with your heart|`|7ZMilKYoaa	First of all that will break your boyfriend's heart and second of all this guy might not even like you for you, or he could be a creepy guy who does drugs!

Do whatever you feel is right :)|`|mI4RaMyraa	Dont listen to what your friends say, as terrible as that may sound, its up to you what you want to do.

33d7210d104ceb5ac8526a1cc2d5871baa	Your not gonna like this, but lots of men like looking at young girls in school uniforms.  Don't know why, but they think that its sexy as hell.   It doesn't mean that your dad is perverse, or demented, he's just normal.  Everyone has a fantasy and they are generally harmless.  <br>  Oh, and no, he does not see you the same way.  Thats kinda freaky.  <br>  So, if the computer is your dad's and for his use, I would suggest you stay off of it.  If its for family use, you could delete the history of web sites before you start surging.|`|qSSiV0mmaa	Why are you snooping on your dad.

CegTlp4Caa	First of all, why are his parents calling off the wedding? Surely that is a decision between you and your fiance. Is it because they are financially tied to it? Secondly, the whole "you slapped me first" scenario probably would never have happened if he hadn't grabbed you and threw you on the bed. He needs to realise that. It sounds like you need to give him some time to cool off, then you need to talk about this. It seems to me that he has changed after his parents have called the wedding off? Do you think he asked them to so he wouldn't have to? I think the most important thing is just to let him cool off though, there's no point in trying to talk to him about it if he's still angry/annoyed, it will just aggravate him even more.|`|Swy5L6Mgaa	If an argument between the two of you can turn physical, this is a huge red flag. In my experience, when a guy is a little aggressive before you even got married, once you put the ring on the finger, things will get much much worse. Your feelings for him may be true, but it sounds like this relationship is toxic. Don't rush into marriage (the paper doesn't solve problems) and don't fight to keep this relationship if you feel like he doesn't want it and doesn't appreciate it just as much as you do. <br>  If he could bring himself to tell you he wants you out of there(regardless of how angry he was at that point), that's exactly what you should do. Although it's painful, walk out - it will spare you bigger pains in the future and you'll make room for something better. <br>  Wish you all the best.<br>  Anna P.|`|y4w6ybr3aa	Sounds like he is trying to get you to break up with him. If he acts like this your fault, he thinks you will take him back if he regrets the break up. Some thing's not right, try and talk to him when everything is more calm. He does owe you some kind of explanation.|`|2V3JZ3Wbaa	Sounds like common sense get in and the parents are smart. Lose him for what, you want get the crap knocked out of you all the time.

If he doesn't come out there on his own, stick your head in the door and ask him stupid questions about what you should or shouldn't do. If he doesn't even respond to that...you need to re-think spending the rest of your life with him; which, you might want to anyway, but who knows? My ex wouldn't get his a** off of the couch to build a privacy fence in the yard, so I did just what I told you to do and started digging post holes and all of that, and he was out there telling me how I didn't know what I was doing.

It works and when she's had enough time to calm down I talk to her again.|`|9w2VFZZFaa	no thats gna make her hate u and be mean to u more|`|2vOxsVGQaa	i'm 15 and my sis is 8...and she does it all the time!!<br>  i can't remember the last time she talked to me in a NORMAL voice!!<br>  but i still love her..i mean...she's my sister<br>  so what i do is...just be cool and keep smiling (even if you just wanna KILL her)...she'll get so pissed off and walk away<br>  also try not answering her at all !! that would work :)
AA12325261	Absolutely not.<br>  Everyone has their own unique personality, especially when it comes to what provides pleasure.<br>  <br>  As long as you are careful and upfront about it, you'll enjoy interactions more and be more satisfied.|`|FuY6LrvBaa	F&^% NO.! there is nothing wrong with that at all, i am like that and so isn't my boyfriend, we have alot of fun ... it's not like THAT between us, but there is nothing wrong with that, it's just you, and how you like things.|`|srAP6Vzvaa	no. i like girls that enjoy pain. infact the best sex i've had been with girls that are masochist. out of this world sex.|`|gGs1QrDhaa	idk....|`|PLXc64xjaa	iT jUst DePeNdS On yOu AnD uR pArTNeR|`|Zc0sJbJTaa	there is nothing wrong with that<br>  <br>  i am the same way too!!!!!|`|QrjjiOgTaa	no. i think most people are to some point. i like being punched, choked, hit, and tied up. hmmmmmmmmm...maybe we're both weird. but i say as long as it is legal do what ever gets you off!
10227ea57ca1a432558caaf5ed576d9caa	Even if he sees this girl for what she is he is hooked into her big time.  This would probably cause problems in any future relationship he has for a time.......it is why you did not last first time round.   Just watch and wait and be a friend to him and be patient if he comes to you all good and well but he is a long way away at the moment.  And if he does he will be damaged goods with baggage .|`|5hxWSezPaa	Get away from the guy.  If he is banging his ex and she is banging 19 other guys, then she and he and you are gonna get STD's.|`|AA11706291	He needs to realise that on his own.<br>  <br>  If you try to prove that to him he'll probably just think you are a crazy stalker type.|`|RncUc0traa	mayb he likes da type of girl|`|hsp7f9Epaa	I have been in the same situation before I got married and had kids<br>  well I say yes if you love him that  much it's never to early to be in love <br>  keep in contact with me|`|S4w5IEHVaa	Don't get involved in her business.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Let him find out on his own.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	recess time?   lol.

"I wish I could just put my hands down his boxers and touch his ars3 all lesson." That sounds pretty damn gay. As, far as being bi? I wish I could compare the level of interests, just to determine who's more attractive.|`|AA11227500	both of you are gay for the sound of things, and I think you possible already know that and you just want confirmation.|`|yFKQFeeJaa	i don't think you're gay i think the kid trying to molest you is.your body was just reacting to touch. your 13 and going through puberty and got confused. just stick with girls and stay away from this kid he sounds like trouble|`|W0ZsuxRTaa	you're straight. it's not bad to be gay or anything, but you're definitely straight. find a girl girl with some nice "ars3" and tap that so you can stop getting boners with this guy.|`|oHN6jwjoaa	you seem to maybe be bi.<br>  <br>  or maybe you are just curious.<br>  some people hit a stage in their life <br>  where they want to experiment with <br>  the same sex.|`|onnK9EACaa	well sorry to say it but i think that it does make you gay or pretty bi|`|LDvgIjP7aa	i think you are probrably bisexual.

Perfectly natural.  Most young boys our age find something attractive about other boys their age.  They just don't admit it because they think it will make them sound gay.  But, everyone does this.  Girls experiment with other girls, and boys will experiment with other boys.  Its just a natural thing to do.  You may very well like girls, but there is something about your friend that you find very exciting.  If he touches you and it excites you, then you touch him and it excites you, then you may feel a need to explore this.  <br>  So you have a couple options.  You can get together with him and talk to him.  Tell him what you are feeling and see if he feels the same way.  I know that if I suggest touching him, I will get a ton of hate mail, but you could touch him and see how he reacts.<br>  Or, you can ignore it and keep thinking about the girls.<br>  Good luck.|`|mbHMdzbyaa	you're probably bi sexual. not a big deal.|`|cYpBnU83aa	Sounds like you're bi, dude.
qNdsNhgOaa	Guys who enjoy porn usually don't "grow out of it", but there are guys that just aren't that interested in it in the first place.  If your boyfriend told you he doesn't watch it, and he told you so without you even asking, odds are he's telling the truth.  It's completely normal for a guy not to feel the need to masturbate.  You should be happy about it.  All this means is that you two have a healthy sex life and an honest relationship!  Best wishes
c3b0303b45fbe6430dc388e695c7e5eaaa	Get away NOW this will only get worse, been there done that had an **** of a life for  years, She was worse, made my life hell, never good enough, but I did stand up to her, but hubby found it difficult.When she upset my kids that`s when I lost it and really told her what I thought, things improved but there`s always been that tension.<br>  Now I`m a Mother-in-law and my kids partners know that I`m there for them all if needed but they ask me when they need help, ask advice,and I stay out of their business, they trust me and respect me and I love them for that, I know what it`s like so I`m very aware of what my place is. <br>  Good luck.|`|lgXSmCQRaa	It sounds like you're complaining and you do this because you are for some reason a bit stressed. This could be because of the new baby or something else. A lot of people don't get support with their baby or family life, just be grateful. Keep chat to a minimum and if you can make sure you are busy when the phone rings. Tell them not to ring at night because you do have a little baby. They are concerned only about how you are conducting yourselfs at the particular time. Just take things easy. Talk with bf.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Take your baby and go back to your own family, and tell your partner that you as a couple either move out of the house and away from their sphere of influence, or you will refuse to let him have any contact with the child because you think his father is abusive and dangerous, and you don't want them having any contact with your or your child. Make it clear that you will not be coming back to such a controlling environment - get a solicitor to write the letter for you, it will be worth the money for the point it gets across. <br>  <br>  I think you'll find that your boyfriend has no legal rights, because you and he are not married. He'll find this out in good time.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	calm down and think rationally about what would happen if you left.  What is the honestly realistically worst thing that his family could do to you if you moved?<br>  <br>  if it is something violent and your BF isn't willing to move then you have to choose your own and your child's safety over the security of your boyfriend's presence and leave ASAP.  You can't worry about what his mother is and isn't doing.  You have to protect yourself and your child.<br>  <br>  If he wouldn't be violent but would just be angry with you, then you live with that.  Not everyone has to like you or like the choices you make in life.  It's your life, you get to say how you live it.  If someone doesn't agree with you then they can just be unhappy or they can remove themselves from your life.
YpDvYy5qaa	Maybe ease him in gently, e.g go some where seculded in public where you wont be watched constantly, where he might not feel watched, maybe a park or the woods or something, and then when he gets more confident in these places try holding his hand in a town when shopping etc! <br>  <br>  Reassure him that noone will be watching him, or thinking anything bad about him for being affectionate with his girlfriend, in fact they probably wont even notice you two as you will be acting normal! <br>  Just make sure you dont push him too far because then it will revert back to nothing at all! <br>  <br>  Hope this helps xxx|`|djUMvICoaa	This will probably go back to his childhood and how his parents did things and how they showed affection and what messages they sent him about what's good and what's bad.  It is a sad thing when we are missing those simple things because they lead to a much better and satisfying life.  You can try but take it in baby steps, trying it where he might be comfortable.  Walking down a darkened street etc.  The other thing that you have to do is try to impress on him how important it is to you, that without it you feel like you're missing how safe you feel in his arms etc.  good luck|`|EyKmEptVaa	My advice is to accept him for who and how he is, or move on,The only person you can truly change is yourself and that's a hard enough job without trying to change someone else.To try and force him to  act in a manner that causes him to feel uncomfortable will only make him resent you in the end.|`|PSGK1zXLaa	Respect his wishes, remove the idea of a couple in your head. Don't expect rather be suprise. He cares about you, he doesn't need to exercise PDA to show how much he does.. As long you feel love. That's all that matters..|`|gDGzbufuaa	Maybe he is embarrassed to show you off in public? Try some new makeup or new wardrobe to be the arm candy he really desires.<br>  <br>  p.s. maybe try losing some weight.|`|n6IBfiDPaa	Deal with it. He doesnt like it, you should love him and respect his wishes.|`|TXY6EAYqaa	Some men are like that hes not unique don't worry about it.|`|YYcR6lESaa	The best advise is to tell you not to worry the fear of PDA will pass|`|eIWPl5yVaa	A leopard does not change its skin. NO|`|OR8hrr0aaa	No advice, seriously don't push it, if someone doesn't like it then end of they will not change, i am one of those people lol and i have been with my bf for 2 and a half years.|`|4EWCegiRaa	Public Display of Affection (PDA) is a difficult subject with many people as it's not really an action, it's a like or dislike.  If you hate vegetables, nobody can change that and this is similar.<br>  <br>  My only suggestion is to ease him into it.  Hold his hand sometimes.  Eventually, hold his hand all the time.  Give him a hug once in a blue moon.  Eventually, hug him more often.  Do it over and over until you get where you want to be with PDA.<br>  <br>  It's something you have to consciously work on a little each day and don't push too hard.  If that doesn't work, then I think you just have to deal with the fact that he doesn't like PDA and it's not going to happen.|`|qSSiV0mmaa	Just accept him the way he is.  Don't try to change him.  If it is that important to you, then you should not be in a relationship with him.  Otherwise just leave him alone about it.|`|xeW6Mvbdaa	You have to go with what he wants...take it or leave it...this is how/who he is! End of! Keep your hands to yourself in public... :-)|`|yPncyjK1aa	I don't see your problem here, if he's not comfortable with it, don't try to force him.

I don't trust online people...|`|AA11603468	So, you don't like people's replies and you insult them by name calling--even though you ASKED for them? <br>  <br>  To answer your question, no I would not swap emails/pix/etc with anyone because I am married, I put my marriage first, and I know that doing that is not a way to put my family/spouse/marriage first. I don't care if you think it's just for fun--your wife would probably not see the fun in it, and how could you look at her knowing what you call fun is something that would hurt her so much? I don't find that to be something I'd want to do, no. You think that's uptight? ok. I think my husband would appreciate it.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	You asked "would you ever do this?" AND told people not be be judgemental?  Answering a question involves judgement.|`|I814g6ZBaa	Only FAKE pics: do you like light or dark hair?  <br>  And are really huge bewbies okay; just askin -- <br>  <br>  Seriously...  this isn't how this site works, Guy.  lol|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	No I am married would not be right. I know a lot of people that do it so go for it!
BSg9J96Oaa	Sweet heart, you don't need that stuff.  You're beautiful just the way you are.  Sit her down and be forward with her and tell her that you can't stand when she nitpicks about your body.  Tell her you are happy with the way you look (even if it's not true, she will back off a little).  She probably says this stuff because she is jealous she's not young anymore, and jealous of you and your accomplishments.  Keep on the bright-side love!|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You're absolutely right. I would say that your mother has the food issues, not you. Skinny is not necessarily beautiful, and there is nothing wrong with enjoying your food. I have found that men enjoy it very much when women enjoy their food and are not always picking at things.|`|I54KyS8Laa	you have a lot of supportive posts and it sounds like your mother sees you as an extension of herself. She also sees in you what she dislikes in herself and that's her problem not yours. <br>  Yet, you need to ground yourself as it doesn't seem you really have anyone to talk this over with who is not going to be judgmental about your mother. <br>  I'd recommend you begin reading books about self image and self consciousness. Books like Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz and Your Erroneous Zones by Wayne Dwyer. Both should be in the library or you can get them on Amazon for fifty cents. <br>  Read, read, and read so you don't end up putting on weight to spite your mother. Get to a  point where you can respond to your mother's criticism with Bill Crosby's answer, "SO!"  <br>  "So you have different ideas about food than I have, so let's agree to disagree" but only after you're read those books.|`|9w2VFZZFaa	try bo talk to her|`|5DJcir9saa	You need to talk with a supportive adult family member about the way your mom is treating you.  Maybe they can make her realize how hurtful her words are.  She probably does not realize that she is hurting you by saying these things.  Unfortunately some people equate beauty with weight, but that is so not true.  The fashion industry is creating self image disorders in girls as young as 8 or 9 years old and its absurd.  Please talk with someone so she doesn't do any more unnecessary damage to your self image.  And remember...Marilyn Monroe was gorgeous and she would be considered "big" by today's standards.  That just shows how ridiculous the fashion industry is.|`|NAyIbRb0aa	remember beauty comes from within not by being skinny If you are a good person and be yourself people will like you for that <br>  Not everyone looks like a  model and most models are snotty people <br>  you have to learn to love yourself when you do this other will love you back <br>  I had the same problem (being over weight) when I was a teen and I looked into the mirror and told myself that I was pretty and I loved myself and it does work <br>  bless you and keep your chin up :)|`|0a0d9e39f830aa50f51dc7fbaf228a71aa	Tell her how you feel.<br>  I mean, like don't tell her all nice.<br>  Be a ***** right back!<br>  Say something like "You act like I'm supposed to be perfect and you do you how imperfect you are?! I'm sure mothers are supposed to be nourishing, but you're just the devil reincarnated"
9x4fssPuaa	You have the ability to look young, happy and fresh. This is a good thing. If you wanted to look older or more glamorous you certainly have the features to do that, by waxing the eye brows smaller or plucking, wearing dramatic make up, curling your hair. But I wouldn't unless you had to dress up. I wouldn't say you are average looking at all. In fact I used to work at a modeling firm and we chose a lot of girls who look like you, in addition to the exotic ones. You have a beautiful look, don't let others make you feel unattractive!|`|8j7FCEOraa	Your skin is very blemished. The blonde only makes your uneven skin tone stick out more. I think a brown hair colour would even it out quite a bit.<br>  Plus try Aveeno illuminating lotion. The green bottle, like $12 at wal-mart. It's amazing, it will help even out your skin tone and even help get rid of under-eye darkness. It even got rid of my dry skin + eczema.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	your pretty|`|gPlUDaRoaa	Um,i am pleading the 5th here.But thanks for the points!!|`|gCiJpRfwaa	I would say you're definitely better than average. Not bad at all.|`|nMzzwrtUaa	you look like the girl next door, your kinda cute but to very young for my taste.|`|H2v03ZGPaa	I don't want to be mean but, my honest opinion is that you're not amazingly gorgeous. No offence of course. I think you're quite pretty though =)<br>  Then again, I can't say whether you're attractive or not cause I'm not a guy!|`|AA11489369	Your good looking. Def. not average. But it's not always looks. I've met plenty of hot and beautiful girls and they are a bi***. Just a horrible personality. But so do some ugly girls. So if you have a sweet personality. Your on a very rare boat.|`|d6ZJj4hVaa	Yeah sorry you're just average looking. You have a heavy face, you'd probably be pretty if you had more delicate features.|`|8QoNSvp6aa	i think your pretty your eyes are very sparkly<br>  id take you on a date easily|`|ZqDvQprCaa	i think you are very pretty!<br>  and your eyes are gorgeous!<br>  im not to crazy about the blue eyeliner though.|`|BO28Mn8haa	average. try growing your hair out. also, i'd like to see you in a brown. your eyes will POP|`|OdFIQYyhaa	your hot ya know.|`|gGs1QrDhaa	yeah sorry but i dont really think you are pretty

I do not think it would be a good play.|`|Urv6eDB5aa	uhh no|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	It sounds more like a play about a moral dilemma, than it is a play about sex.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	don't do it|`|EyaqiWPwaa	to sandwich or not to sandwich....thats the real question....|`|AA12325261	Like those above, I had to guess as to what your bloody point was.

JtEBaOdjaa	Why not have it in the winter? I'm sure your South American family would LOVE to see snow.

So it's not so scorching hot.|`|AA10104020	i think that June would be a perfect time. June or May. That is definitely cooler than July, but I've been to Montreal in July and it's really not that hot. Especially after 3. Good luck and happy wedding!
1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	I think she's just eight.<br>  <br>  At eight, your daughter may be beginning to move out of the cute phase and into the pre-teen independent phase.  While eight is a little young for this, having an older brother might be helping her along the trail a little faster than most kids.<br>  <br>  If she isn't consistently having trouble with her school work, it's probably not that she doesn't understand it.  She probably just doesn't want to do it, which is normal actually.<br>  <br>  She's experimenting with being naughty.  What happens if she's generally a pain in the rear end?  What happens if she doesn't do her school work?  What happens if she shouts back at mom and dad?<br>  <br>  The solution is to be firm and consistent.  Hitting is not necessary.  Yelling is ineffective, as you mentioned, and can also be damaging.  Your best bet is to begin instituting groundings.<br>  <br>  Sit down with her and explain your expectations.  Explain what the consequences will be if she does not meet these expectations.  Then, be firm and carry through with the consequences.  When she's satisfied with what happens, she'll stop those behaviors.<br>  <br>  She's a kid, so she'll start other behaviors up after that, but you'll deal with those when they come.<br>  <br>  She doesn't sound like a troubled child.  Just sort of willful and maybe more of a handful than your older son.  Don't fret, willful children can be great blessings.  Their determination and curiosity are the driving force behind most of the world's progress, I think, so the goal should never be to crush her spirit.  Just set firm boundaries and stick to them and you'll be all right.|`|mrysAOpGaa	she's 8 years old, you cant expect her to be an A+ student that young, thats being a little hard on her, and you might be putting stess on her and she's going to feel that shes not pleasing you enough or that youre proud of her.  B grades are good for her age.  Let her be a kid, i could understand if she was saying screw it all and getting all F's as grades, lighten up on her.  and as for the fights with her sibilings, thats going to be ongoing, im 24 and me and my sisters to this day still have fights.  Let her be a kid and let her know youre proud of her for the grades she is recieving|`|ifIW4vuqaa	To be honest, I think it's partially that she's just eight years old. She's not going to be focused on school, and she is most certainly going to fight with her siblings. Perhaps though, you might seek counseling or a tutor's help with the school problem. Perhaps be a bit more firm. Not hitting, but perhaps a punishment system in place of the reward one. Like she doesn't get to have soda unless she fulfills 'x' requirements.

You need to be very careful with people you meet like this.|`|w9rd1biRaa	my suggestion is plz don't trust guys like that coz smtimes guys do this kinda things only for time-pass nd due to se*ual orientations.<br>  <br>  being a boy i suggest u|`|QE2GKQWkaa	Um........dont talk to him. Also, tell the nearest police station.|`|kvcIdORcaa	some people have deep voices... i had a friend who was 15 but he sounded older. anyways, you're obsessing too much over guys on the internet. if you don't want to talk to them anymore, simply block and delete them. if you're so scared stop exchanging all kinds of personal information and stop calling them or talking about meeting up with them.
eIWPl5yVaa	I don't know|`|xuiSfzgraa	I agree!  As much as I like Carly and Jax together, Sonny and Carly have so much more interesting storylines!
eIWPl5yVaa	Then leave him. A broken engagement (Short term) is better than a broken marriage (Long term)|`|4EWCegiRaa	You love him, right?  You want it to work out, right?  Then stop having bitter immature arguments!  <br>  <br>  --->  YOU take the first step.  Say "I'm going to do this as a good faith effort" and then he'll do something nice back.  Then you do something nice back and then he'll do something nice back.  It'll kind of turn into a fun game whereby you each try to do something the other one wants BECAUSE YOU WANT EACH OTHER TO BE HAPPY.  Not out of spite or to win an argument but because you want to make each other happy.|`|B1jZars7aa	dump him then, your not his wife, so go for it,dont waste your precious time if you two dont get along.
KVFYJrDJaa	If you're ok with him doing it, tell him he has to buy replacements because bras aren't cheap, even if you can get away with wearing the cheapeys from Target or wherever, especially if you're buying new ones several times a month. <br>  <br>  It's his deal so you should make him buy you replacements, or leave your bras alone and he can buy you ones you don't mind being destroyed. It's one thing to rip a pair of hose or the occasional panties to get at you, but 3 bras a month is a bit of an expensive habit for you to pay for.<br>  <br>  He'll either learn a little restraint or buy stock in Victoria's Secret!|`|axxQzOCHaa	Tell him << You ripped it, You gotta pay for the next one. >><br>  Are you sure you are wearing the right size though?|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	Ask him to buy you sexy underwear.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	i had a bf who used to like to pull on my necklaces. i would yell "no" and "stop", one day he broke one that i really liked, i was pissed and stopped talking to him until he had it fixed and he never did it again. im getting kinda angry just thinking about this lol. good bras are expenisve, make him pay you 40 bucks (standard price) for every bra he rips or tell him to take sewing classes until then no love. when you are "alone" and he starts pulling yell at him that you dont like it. if he still does it, get rid of him. thats a big red flag!!|`|mTwn8p79aa	I think you should take him bra shopping too.  He might be a little more careful if he understands he's going through a few hundred bucks of clothes a month.  Even more careful if it's his money.<br>  <br>  I'm also going to agree with the person that thinks this is a red flag.  This could be a good indicator of someone who's violent with women.  Fun and games now but it could be bad later.|`|SNC58uQvaa	No way would I let him tear up my cloths.<br>  <br>  If he is going to destroy your clothing then he should have to pay.<br>  <br>  Be very careful with this person, he is pretending that he is raping you, and that is dangerous.<br>  <br>  If he is allowed to tear your cloths off then you should be able to cut his cloths up afterwords with the scissors.<br>  <br>  I would not wear any undies around him and I would consider purchasing cloths from a resale shop. S and A Boutique. (Salvation Army)<br>  <br>  The guy is sick, get him help quick.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I think he needs to buying you the bras he ruins. Then he might curb his animal instincts a bit, lol. Or maybe take them off before the fun begins, hehe.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	..have him go with you to the mall and purchase some new cute undies and bra's for you I suppose.<br>  If he's gonna animalistically rip them off of you and destroy them consequentially...he should at least be willing to assist you in repurchasing replacement undies for you reasonably....wouldn't you agree?<br>  Certainly he should still get his naked rewards from you hun...but alert him to the fact that panties and bra's aren't cheap here either.<br>  "if ya wanna play sweetie?...ya gotta pay darlin"...especially for the garments he shreds from your purely intoxicating naked body...agreed?<br>  Have fun babe..be safe...and get him to buy your undies from here on out.......cool?<br>  Enjoy!!!|`|JCdBSULraa	As a Star Trek fan, I have to endorse the Ferangi philosophy.  They believed it was unethical to clothe their females, as it only invites others to undress them, the very height of perversion.  <br>  <br>  So as a simple solution, just do not wear clothing when you are around him.|`|wJIm06qHaa	In all honesty it's pretty disrespectful of him to damage your property regardless of whether he likes to or not.  Stand up for yourself!  Tell him to knock it off!|`|QAGaQUDRaa	Make him take you lingerie shopping and pay for those bras. I bet he'll stop ripping them off when he sees how much they cost.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Take him bra shopping and ask him to buy them since he is the one that rips them off.|`|65B842gaaa	make him buy you new ones. in short make him pay.|`|9BCysAZDaa	Don't wear them anymore?|`|J8YeCh9waa	Duh.  Take them off first.|`|ZzPD423paa	Jenny,<br>  <br>  Either go braless on your dates or take him shopping with you to Victoria's Secret.  Make sure he sees the price tags on those bras and undies my dear!   Make sure he knows your size and then tell him to either stop it or bring a bra with him next time....You need to set this guy straight with his expensive habit!  That's like smashing three bottles of wine on your floor every time he comes over....I simply wouldn't allow it!  Time to lay down the law with this monster.|`|hCC5GKgJaa	Maybe let him know that you like it, but it is costly, and he should try not to destroy them or maybe treat him to a "vicious clothes ripping session" once in a while. If he really enjoys it, taking it away could crush him, so just talk to him, and come up with something|`|SR1FN2nqaa	interesting to say the least . but if i were you id tell him he needs to start buying you new ones to replace the ones he has destroyed. he is quite aggessive but then again just about everyone has a fetish of some sort. but on the other hand id be a little weary of what he would want to do when he got bored of that..food for thought.|`|krIKhZzcaa	Tell him to just tone it down just alittle bit. Because bras and underwear cost $$$, so if he does it again, just ask him to help you buy it next time.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps :)|`|8khqSyxnaa	Rip up his clothes and see how he likes it. Sounds like he needs to calm down a bit and save the big aggresive sex for special occasions.|`|SPh4ctPCaa	Make him pay for it. Then he'll stop. Or you can just wear no bras.|`|nFOllgtDaa	Either make him pay for your ripped bras or rip his clothes off too just to get even lol|`|T3crw25kaa	Ask him to buy you some lingerie that you can use for this purpose.<br>  <br>  <br>  Answered with doggy-style|`|IkAtIQumaa	Tell him to buy you new ones.|`|x7uYAPaSaa	Say you like to have wild sex every so often, not all the time. Maybe you could say could we be a little more romantic|`|2DRWQxP3aa	go Commando when you know you're going to spend some alone time.|`|UsJDUm1Haa	ask him to please be a little more careful.|`|Qe95LNxYaa	you do the same thing rip his clothes fair and square|`|M7aZKOl3aa	wow that's hot, ask him to replace them|`|7zIAKszxaa	im with the person that says make him pay for it thats hott though lol you should do it to him|`|jhPqgYtCaa	You say you don't want to ask him to stop, so you're going to have to deal with it. As long as he keeps ripping them, you're going to have to keep buying new clothes. Simple logic. If you want to put an end to it, explain to him how impractical this is for you. If you can't tell him this (for whatever reason) try and  cut him off before he does it and strip for him instead.<br>  <br>  That, or rip his clothes and give him a taste of his own medicine.<br>  <br>  lol ;D|`|AA11489369	Tell him that you would like for him to be gentle.<br>  Or just tell him that if he wants to keep doing that **** he needs to buy you new bras.|`|5ZDzIWwOaa	Well when you know your going to be spending the night with him then put on a cheap pair that you wouldn't mind been ripped|`|LZ8cMFzmaa	maybe buy a bunch of SUPER CHEAP bras and stuff and let him destroy those ones but tell him he needs to be careful with the good ones?|`|YXTMk7H5aa	Whoa tht is hott..... wish i had a boyfriend   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ): KaItLyN ):|`|dEb85e07aa	LoL just let him keep doing it but next time you go buy bottoms and bras take him with you so he can pay|`|GnkoLPImaa	wear an un-rippable bra!|`|UzPGSAQCaa	if you know your going to be alone, don't wear a bra !<br>  if that doesn't work, just simply tell him..|`|HtAXbr2Taa	Wear a different bra?|`|zxk9CMACaa	make him pay
xkVeB14naa	Ugh, people are going to say leave him cause he put his hands on you. But I know its much harder said than done. My boyfriend gets physical with me as well, but I would not want to be with anyone else. It is really up to you. If he no longer hurts you physically then you should stay with him because it sounds like you really do care about him. Sometimes it takes a lot for someone to change, my boyfriend used to hit me all the time, and with time it lessened, and he said he realized how wrong he was, and even though his temper gets the best of him sometimes, and people think Im an idiot for staying around cause he still hits me, I just love him too much to walk away, and I have faith that one day he will be able to control himself and we can work through this.|`|euSMSQl9aa	WELL YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS LEADING TO AN CHRIS AND RIHANNA RELATIONSHIP. BUT IT'S UP TO  YOU TO FINISH THE RELATIONSHIP, IT'S NOT WORTH ALL THE TROUBLE ONCE YOU LET HIM GO IT YOUR LIFE WILL FEEL SO MUCH BETTER. TRUST ME. LET HIM GO|`|0LwNYEUdaa	He loves you but he has a bit of insecurity issues he has to deal with or is dealing with mentally. The way he acts is a result of his troubled past mainly some act of childhood abuse or he may be traumatized by the effects of  growing up in an environment where all he knew about or saw was violent acts. You have to make a decision as to whether or not you are willing to deal with this. So far it sames as though you can. Ironically women seem more attracted to aggressive more violent men but sometimes you have to draw the line. When your outer beauty is gone so will he. Never let a man hit you or you'll always be a boxing bag|`|6jtioTxfaa	I was  in this kind of situation a few months ago, the best thing to do is just leave, he's not worth it. He's always going to treat you badly and you don't deserve that. <br>  <br>  It was hard for me to leave my boyfriend, we were together a very long time, but now im with someone else who makes me completely happy and its wierd being with someone who is so sweet to me but its actually very very nice, I hope you make the right choice and leave him for good.|`|Ce3glk6Faa	If you really don't love him then maybe its time to end it, maybe he did have a terrible childhood and that's the reasoning for why he is the way he is but he is not a child anymore and has to take responsibility for his own life and his actions can no longer be justified because of how he was brought up. This guy has already physically and emotionally hurt you more than once, and i'm sorry but no one can change their entire personality over night. He may say he has changed for good, but there is no telling how long that will last and if he is thousands of miles away how can you really tell how much he has changed? If I was you I would get out of this relationship, and leave it behind you. Sounds like this guy has serious issues he needs to work through before he can be in a serious relationship with anyone. <br>  Good Luck :)|`|DRKzzw0Haa	Run like Hell is after you. This guy is a dominant overbearing troubled man. A man who tells you he doesn't love you and is physically abusive is the beginning of what the future holds. He will not change!<br>  Get a restraining order now. Move and change your numbers if it's possible. Tell yourself 24,000 times per day that this is not going to work because it isn't.|`|NJrkgBaWaa	If he had a bad child hood and I don't know the story you should give him a bit of a brake, and if called you back "sobbing" and I hope he apologized for hurting you then he actually cares.  If you two actually care about eachother you should talk about how you feel with him while your alone.|`|ZtHMfNSUaa	Ok heres what I think, (Guys point of veiw) I had a bad childhood too ok... But that is NEVER an excuse to hit or bruise a lady (unless its really kinky sex) He is a violent man, and ok maybe he will change, BUT if he hits you or bruises you again. I would seriously end it, I am a frim believer in second chances. But honestly you deserve better, and if he cant give you that then leave him.|`|cfJywdN2aa	GET OUT OF THE RELATIONSHIP NOW!!!!!<br>  DO YOU HEAR ME, THERE IS NO REASONS FOR A GUY TO HIT A GIRL NO REASON. IF HE DOES THAT AGAIN REPORT HIM YOU GOT IT. Sorry If i sounded like I was shouting but thats because this is a terrible situation and i dont want any girl in that.|`|krIKhZzcaa	I know everyone is telling you this, but you REALLY do need to leave him. Bad love is not is not worth it at all. Find someone who doesn't hurt you, or get over protective of you. Most guys do not change even though they say they do. So just break it off right away.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps :)|`|oOILfiPvaa	ok look honey you need to get out of that relationship because they are not good my mom was in one and i was to and its not fun at all. look all he wants is to have you all to his-self and he cant handle not having you. break up with him and find someone new you say your not ugly so go for someone who is going to treat you like a person not a dog|`|tgxDZ7Bjaa	You need to be careful. Try to go to treatments for anger management and to help him cope with his past. Believe me, it'll help him change even more. But you have to know when to scram if things get too dangerous. If he tries something stupid again just call the cops and scream like a crazy person. It'll freak him out but more people will know about what's going on and try to help you. Also, try to always be where there's people. You have more of a chance to receive help. But don't wait too long or it may as well be too late and to a fellow sister, I wouldn't want that to happen.|`|zoiiNcX5aa	i do not know you or your boyfriend but all i can say is get out of that relationship! i know you love him but the beating will get worse, its like throwing your life away, good luck|`|42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	I can agree with another poster's assessment that you *both* need Anger Management.<br>  <br>  That being said...drop him, and run. Personally, after he dragged you (a pedestrian) by the arm while driving a car, I would have pressed Criminal Charges and requested an Order of Protection.<br>  <br>  As for your boyfriend's childhood...my mother was abused by a family friend as a child, and as such she still can not fully trust any male. That being said, I never felt less loved.<br>  <br>  Move on with your life, and grow. Tell him that you can't trust him, and ask that he not try to communicate with you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|c5UAa65qaa	Honestly, paranoia that you're going to leave him if you can't jump to respond to him right away isn't a sign that his issues are getting better at all.  What happens when he gets back and is capable of trying to track you down the way he did before?<br>  <br>  If you want to continue giving him a chance, make sure he takes advantage of whatever help is available to him wherever he's stationed; the trauma in his past needs to be worked through so that it doesn't affect his present.  Personally, though, I think I'd end it and get help for yourself to figure out what would make you want to stay in a relationship that makes you frightened for your safety.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	You both need anger management classes. The way you both behave is inappropriate and abusive.  Learn to communicate and to treat others with respect.|`|2V3JZ3Wbaa	If you say your bf is a a$$hole , that answers your question. Too much drama and no man abuses me in any form or fashion.|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	You've had your problems. He's had a rough childhood and is taking it out on you and you feel like if you can't take it and abandon the relationship then that makes you a bad person. What happened to him sucks, but it's still his problem to deal w/ it. If he's too volatile to lean on family and friends exclusively, then he needs professional help. The military will likely help him a lot, and realize that he may change as a person to the extent that you're no longer right for him by the time you see him next anyway.<br>  <br>  Neither me or anyone else on here is in a position to take your six paragraphs and you give better more appropriate advice than that of your friends. Your friends know you better, they know him better, and they know what's better for you. Listen to your friends. They're trying to look out for you, and if they say it's time to leave this guy, the I trust that advice and will urge you to do the same.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	I think that if he wants to prove that he is going to change - just words are not enough.<br>  <br>  He should put his action where his words are - and find help.<br>  The outburst you describe makes me worried - if he uses violence that easy, and with intention to hurt you - or drives in such a way to almost intentionally hurt other traffic participants - he is a dangerous person, for you and for his environment.<br>  <br>  The paranoia bit is also worrying. Bad childhood is never an excuse, as we CHOOSE to do what we do - and we cannot ever blame someone else for (in this case) hurting a woman.<br>  <br>  Has he, in the past 2 months, sought help? As in go to a therapist for anger management therapy?<br>  Has he talked to a counselor? Or a doctor?<br>  If you are honest, and have to answer no here - then I would recommend you leave him until that time at least where he has actually completed a therapy.<br>  Why?<br>  <br>  Because if you do nothing, you are in fact sending the message that what he did was not so bad. It means you are okay with the way he is now, which is for all intents and purposes abuse waiting to happen.<br>  <br>  Love is a wonderful thing, but it does tend to blind us to some nastier sides our partners may have. <br>  <br>  Consider this:<br>  What if you marry, and have a child (or children) and he again loses control and does to a child the same he did to you?<br>  Children cannot handle that much power, and he might very well crack a bone or a jaw.  Can you live with that on your consciousness?  <br>  <br>  So, to make a long story short - Demand he get therapy - or leave him. That is my advice.<br>  <br>  If you want to ask more - you can contact me through my Y!A profile.|`|BO28Mn8haa	kind of seems like me and my boyfriend. except my boyfriend has never once laid a hand on me. we used to argue a lot and now he is a lot better and even a little paranoid that i will leave him. if he ever laid a hand on me, i would have never looked back. i suggest you do the same. everyone deserves better. leave him, and pray he doesn't stalk you|`|Ch39oU58aa	Yeah it was a dumb move to take him back. Sorry to say but that kind of dangerous behavior will most likely continue when he gets back.  He seems really unstable and could cause you serious harm one day.  I understand he has been through a lot, but it isn't your responsibility to stay with him because you want to help him/ not upset him.  Find someone that treats you right and be happy.<br>  <br>  Take care|`|Di6FAQxRaa	Okay can you see yourself with this guy in the future? I Think you should stay with him if you care about him, because you hit him in the face. He only held your wrists down, so you have abused him also. You guys can both work it out; if you both work on your abusive hitting ways together.If you CARE for HIM and he cares for you then you guys should both talk it over and agree that shouting and yelling and hitting is not going to keep your relationship happy.What will make you guys both happy is talking it over in a respectful manner. And he is deployed now, so can you deal with a long distance relationship. You have to make a list for yourself and have good/ bad on it. If the good outweighs the bad about him, then stay with him. But if the bad outweighs the good, then leave him. If that is the case then tell him about the checklist and that there is too much bad things that's happened in the relationship and that it is not something you can move on with. Also, remember that you hit him also so he's not the only to blame alone.|`|fLU63N4kaa	Get out of there. If he has problems, they're his problems and he should deal with them. <br>  <br>  But any man who lays a finger on a woman, no matter what the situation, is trash.|`|iGxEExUhaa	Since your boyfriend had a bad childhood why not try to get counselling or try seeing a psychologist to relieve himself of the trauma he still feels and is experiencing. If he wishes not to and you encourage on more than on occasion then you'll have to make up your mind on what you want to do because if you both have an argument he just cant think the solution is to hit you. Try to talk to him let him openly release is anger and both of you should work out a method when he gets angry what he should do. Example try walking around the house, take a ride, whatever works for him try to be cooperative. If he doesn't want to listen you'll have to consider what you want to do because this relationship could be to the detriment of your body.(physically abuse) EMAIL ME BACK|`|kSWV0tlxaa	I fell well worried for you :|<br>  be carefull seriously.<br>  if he touches you again.<br>  tell me, ill sort him out ;)<br>  haha x<br>  but maybe you should just say, listen im a girl. im not one of your mates who you go to football with or who you have burping contests with im your girlfriend, respect me!<br>  but if he says BLAH BLAH BLAH say, thats it. were over.<br>  you treat me like sh!t and i cant take it anymore.<br>  now go for a boy whos closer to you and who you think will be more caring.<br>  <br>  goodluck babycakes<br>  <br>  .xo|`|kkVHXm1Kaa	leave him alone break it off with him i think that you need to be with someone who will treat you right. not only that but the military controls your mind and makes you think you need to be # 1 and you have to be number one so that didnt help soo leave him alone|`|rG6CkvmHaa	well i understand where hes comming from to driver all crazy and grab u and everything ive done that to my current gf and we have broken up because of it but like always she has taken me back!! u just need to sit him down and let him know how you feel tell him if he doesnt treat u right then ull find someone who will treat u right people do change i promise it just takes time!! ive done the same things my gf asked me not to multipile times and everytime i convince her im ready to change and get her back u just need to convince him ull be getting pounded by someone else if he doesnt treat u right!! lol im serious tho...i dunno hope i made sense
eIWPl5yVaa	He might be frustrated with something other than you. But is letting out his frustrations on you. Crying would not help. I suggest you talk it out with him , and pray for God's intervention.|`|qSSiV0mmaa	Are the children you mentioned, yours only?  If so I would just leave him if he really treats you that bad.  Also, I believe there are 2 sides to every story.  Is there something you are doing too that makes him feel unappreciated & hurt like the way you feel.  You really need to sit down with him & find out what is going on.  Without knowing what his feelings & thoughts its hard to give you much advice. Good luck.|`|LpvXjoVbaa	maybe you should try talking to him about it.... you should also do stuff to get your mind off of it maybe you can enroll your kid in karate or martial arts while you do something like that too like kickboxing|`|4EWCegiRaa	Why don't you do something EXTRA great for him and then say "You you seem so stressed out lately and I just want you to be happy so I did this for you".  <br>  <br>  This way he knows he's been being mean and he knows you want to be there for him without him feeling defensive.  Maybe it'll make him step back and realize that he's been wrong lately when your kindness and love shines through.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	I don't know what to tell you other that I am in the same boat but on the man side of the equation.  My wife is a non-emotional controller and over the 12 years of marriage she has slowly pulled away from me.  She won't smile or laugh, she doesn't share her thoughts, and she avoids talking to me or touching.  <br>  <br>  I have tried talking to her and it only gets worse.  She won't respond or change in any way.  We have been going to counseling and it's a little better but not really.  I feel lonely and scared that I invested so much and now she has emotionally left our relationship.  <br>  <br>  We have two daughters and everything in our family life is in good shape.  I'm a nice person and I help around the house and do the best I can.  But starting several years ago my wife started acting like I was the devil and a total annoyance, and when I would ask why she would either leave the room or give a brief answer that made no sense and also changed daily (ie, "the excuse of the day")<br>  <br>  I feel for you.  At this point I guess we just go each day and see what happens.  Maybe when we die and go to heaven then it will finally be explained.
SR1FN2nqaa	REAL EASY.....stop chasing him and give him plenty of space. let him start to wonder why your not calling him all the time, asking him out all the time....<br>  <br>  stop acting like you cant live without him.|`|QZvfVOOzaa	get laid|`|iYoDBjnhaa	Stop doing all that your doing an see what happens, if you stop being the man in the relationship and just let things be then at some point in time he will start to wonder why you haven't called or why you two haven't been anywhere lately. Try it an see, you can never tell.|`|cfJywdN2aa	Okay, So  u call ask him out bla bla bla, stop being the chaser, let him chase you. That is how i scared all my old bfs off from being the chaser
VZVGXRyraa	Honestly, religion or not...you two need to talk about it and sort it out and if he won't talk about it, then just call it quits.<br>  <br>  I'm very religious, but i would never leave my fiancee (who's hardly religious at all) just hanging like that. That's very rude and disrespectful. He needs to explain in depth where he's coming from and why he's making these decisions. If he cares about the relationship at all, he should be explaining and reassuring you.<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend is religious and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. It's a part of him and it should be respected. I do feel i can communicate with God through my prayers and i do feel that he has a plan for me, but i let my girlfriend in on all of these things and she respects where i'm coming from and understands that God is a very big part of my life. But like i said above, i take the time to explain everything to her. Your boyfriend is just going about things in the wrong way a little bit. Sit him down and ask him to explain.|`|2V3JZ3Wbaa	If he is Christian, he is considering that he should marry someone that is one too. It is not that your are a bad person or anything like that. But if he is really serious about his relationship with God, he will date or marry someone who is a Christian. Dont be surprised if he breaks up with you. I am not being mean, this happens alot with young people, who are trying to think their life though. Dont mean to be offensive with the answer.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	he seems unstable. get rid of him. anyone who says "god told me to" is just not right in the head. and it seems like he doesn't want to be with you but is a coward so he is blameing god for it. nice huh? you don't want this kind of life. just imagine it...... "o god told me we shouldnt get married in june even though you want to" "o god told me we shouldnt have chicken for dinner even though you already cooked it." leave now.|`|bH1OnSoNaa	Relations are successful if both are satisfied emotionally and physically....i think he is too religious, which is not a good thing...u no to much god in everything doesn't sounds good. <br>  <br>  Your relationship can survive i am sure if you both talk to each other and figure out the loop holes and fix them permanently.|`|3BfmNEdPaa	I doubt that it's that cause a friend of mine is Christian and she went out with and atheist and that didn't come between them. Maybe he's one of those very christian people like my father. Just relax and see what happens, don't start freaking out or anything. just try to cope and you'll get through.|`|KVFYJrDJaa	His problem is that his religious influencers, be they familiar or strictly papal, are telling him that sex before marriage is a sin and that living with you out of wedlock is a sin. WRONG!! The "God" that "told him" in this situation is his pastor or preacher or his parents. <br>  <br>  I am an agnostic - I believe in a higher power but I do not subscribe to any religion - so any other people who answer and say I'm godless or whatever can stick it. This is not the Dark Ages, this is the 21st century. Why wouldn't it be ok to live with the person you plan to marry? Wouldn't you want to know that you can live with the person compatibly for 6 or 12 months, or a couple of years before deciding that you're going to try to commit to spend the rest of your life with them? Wouldn't you want to know that they please you and you please them sexually and emotionally before you marry them? You'd be an idiot not to find these things out. <br>  <br>  And something that ticks me off about "religious" people is that they can get away with saying "god talks to me" and "god told me this or that" and it's a-ok. But if a homeless person or a manic street preacher is out telling everyone about what god told them, they're crazy and should be locked up! I gotta call BS on that one, sister. <br>  <br>  Sorry to pontificate on your question. At any rate, I have to call BS on your bf, amiga. If he is treating you like that now, how long before he's telling you that you have to be saved if you want to be with him? <br>  Relationships between the very religious and the non-religious rarely work because the agendas have a tendency to be completely divergent. <br>  <br>  You have to ask yourself if these pseudo-evangelical shenanigans, which are very likely to get worse before they get better (if they ever get better) are worth it. If you think it is worth it to be with this person, be prepared to convert and love it, because if you try to fake it, he'll know (or pretend not to notice) and you'll be miserable with a husband you don't love, a religion you don't believe in, and a horde of children that are being biased by his psycho-dogma. <br>  <br>  After all that, you probably think I'm a Christian basher, but that's not the case. I have nothing against anyone or their religion. But I do have rather a lot against anyone who will tell you that what you're doing is wrong because it doesn't fit into their narrow view of the world. <br>  <br>  Now, I'm ready for the right wing Christian fundamentalist nutjobs lambaste me. <br>  <br>  Whatever you choose to do in this situation, I hope you find the happiness, and the man, you so richly deserve.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	I don' t think God told him, I think his chruch community advised him against it.  Living with someone where sex isn't being had is not the ideal situation when it's a relationship.  The people in his church recognized that he may "give in" and have sex before marriage with you, and that he would be "living in sin".  <br>  <br>  Personally, I think you and him are probably not going to work out, unless he leaves the church, or you join it.  He's far too involved for a relationship with a non christian to truly work.  <br>  <br>  It's my opinion that you seriously considering ending this before the fight to "save your soul" begins.  Being religious isn't bad, so if you're okay with that for yourself, then go for it.  But if you aren't okay with that, then brace yourself for some heartache.|`|Urv6eDB5aa	Actually i  don't think its religious reasons that he's doing this because God doesn't tell us break up with this girl and kiss that one ! and if he doesn't see that what he's doing is a sin with you than what does religion have to do <br>  he maybe going through things , ask him and talk more to him about it <br>  but religion isn't the deal here in my opinion
EDXh0tk9aa	Leave him be. He's Just Not that into You - read the book or see the movie.|`|QPTlQCiSaa	I think that you need to let it go....I would look for someone else|`|ff1c2e48172050aa84a84803cabb7a5faa	He's just not that into you- just like the book, just like the movie.  First of all, if he really liked you he would have got your number and would have called you- you wouldn't have had to get his.  Guys like a chase.  You just handed it all to him by making out with him and calling him right away.  Read the book :)  Sorry honey- move on.|`|UP33GlBwaa	Well, you could do one of two things.....you could call him to see what's up and ask him if he wants to meet up again, or you could just let him call you.  I would most likely do the latter, because I dont like to chase guys.  I think that once anyone tells you that they are going to contact you, then they should follow through on their word.  If the guy likes you enough, I really think he will make the effort to contact you and ask you out.  If not, there's alot of fish in the sea and one that will definitely give you his word and keep it.
2qqQFgLDaa	Look at the big picture, could you go without having your GF in your life any more? It's a big risk. I know it's hard to follow but, follow your heart. How well do you know this girl? What if she is a wolf in sheep's clothing? What are you missing in your 5 yr relationship to make you consider another person....Be careful and THINK hard about it! Good luck.|`|WRcayKnPaa	Well, it's a question of whether or not you love the "girl of your dreams". In these situations it's vital not to act on impulse. Make sure you know what kind of person the second girl is before you make your move. If you really love the girl of your dreams then let your girlfriend down lightly, making sure you let her know that it has NOTHING to do with her, that you are in love with the other girl. Hope that helped ^_^|`|Tuv79aXWaa	If you've been in a relationship with your girlfriend for 5 years and she's not all you want, then maybe it's not meant to be. Don't hang on because it's been 5 years or you dont' want to hurt her, do what you think is best for yourself and to make you happy. You don't want to live the rest of your life like that.|`|bE0KxI9Xaa	dump your gf...she will get over it!!|`|FmhUZLgoaa	Well if you decide to call her then you should end it with your girlfriend. If you are not honest with your girlfriend you will hurt her more. Follow your heart but make sure you don't hurt your girlfriend by cheating.|`|AA11085356	Well, if you want to be with your girlfriend, I wouldn't call the other girl. But if you are willing to lose your girlfriend to try and start something with the other girl, you need to break up with her first. Don't fool around on her, that's not right. You need to decide what girl you really want to be with and stick with it.|`|unVj43Xxaa	Maybe your at a point where you need to learn what is important to you right now. If being in a serious relationship is then don't let this other girl cloud what is important and stop giving out your number to other girls that may or may not be what you want. If you are tired of the serious relationship thing then break up with the gf and be single for awhile. Your question can only be answered by you. You know the difference between right and wrong and you have morals, I'm sure so you decide what needs to happen that will make you happy and is honest and fair to your gf.|`|YEgu0ULvaa	well thats everyones problemsbro u can simply use the step by step break up and this depends on ur gf u should break up with her sooo slowly so that she doesn;t even feel it and i did it b4 u just needto think how and this all depeneds on ur gf mood and way of life so u figure it ou bro and allof wat i said is based on the fact that this gurl is u \r dream gurl if not then cancel all ma words and get back to ur gf ... :( wish i helped but i think i didn't|`|YCDS4Am8aa	well do what you feel will make you happy but i hope you dont make a mistake and loose something good|`|155bc8c47b6ea8173ed60e21cb549f5eaa	If you like this girl then you are better off hurting your girlfriend now because it will only get worse if you go behind her back to talk to someone else... I know because I just went through this my ex was talking to some other girl, he didn't have any feelings towards her except for a friend but then we had a really bad night and didn't Talk to each other about it, he went home and she came over just to watch a movie and ended up kissing him... when he told me it tore me up we ended up breaking up the day after he told me and now he has more feelings towards her and it hurts me more because I am still in love with him... Him and I are still friends but if you actually like this girl then I guarantee that you and your girl won't be friends if you talk to the other girl behind her back because you want more than a friendship with the other girl... spare your girlfriend the heart ache and tell her "I know we have been through a lot but I'm not sure if this relationship is the best thing for us..." or something like that, be nice about it and PLEASE to spare her more pain than necessary don't date the other girl right away, you can talk to her but nothing more until about a month or two after the break up... it will still hurt your girlfriend but it's better than cheating... TRUST ME... 5 years is a long time but a lifetime with someone when you have feelings for someone else is longer...  your girlfriend will find someone else that makes her happy and you have to let her even if it hurts you. but you have to understand that it is going to be hard for her no matter what you do just harder if you sneak around... especially if she finds out from someone else.
BSg9J96Oaa	I've felt like that for seven years.  I've attempted suicide 15 times, cut my wrists, and tried drugs to keep my mind off of stuff.  None of that stuff ever helps.  I had a boyfriend that was jealous of my accomplishments too.  He was mentally abusive, and brought me down with him.<br>  <br>  Try talking to a school counselor or the school psychiatrist.  Even if you go in there and don't talk for the first few times it's alright, at least you're making an effort.  Just talking to someone who is outside your small network of people will greatly help. They can provide an incite no one else can.  There's also anti-depressants that can help, but it takes awhile to find the right one.  There will always be those days.  Keep your chin up sweety!|`|Aivd8EAMaa	i feel the SAME exact way you do, but my situation is much worse.<br>  <br>  i wish i could just runaway to somewhere nice and be happy<br>  <br>  :(|`|PkZ1Lrpnaa	Sounds like things are tough for you right now.. but I promise you, this too shall pass.  We all have our moments where we think nothing is going right, nothing is good in our lives.. and what we have to do in those moments is recognize that there are some good people, and some good things in this life that we need to stick around for.  You mentioned you have 2 or 3 real friends.  Can you go talk to one of them about what you are feeling? Or even just go out with one of them for a day out, for a walk or something to get your mind off of your troubles.|`|lgXSmCQRaa	Wow you sound completely overburdened. It is said that us youths can be so burdened and yet so young. The adults are accountable dear!<br>  <br>  I don't know what to say to you because I answered yes to the majority of those questions. Try not to care about what others think I know its hard but its too much and you can not change what they think. Focus on getting to college or something so you can move away from you parents and just be free, I am at Uni now and to some degree free of the crap my parents bring.

f36bb855b6fe4f58fc6b6148329e13a6aa	Well being divorced from a preachers son. His family made it a HUGE deal. However to me, the issue was mine and my childrens happiness. Divorce is a big deal because of the business of it all. Assets, children, and the emotions involved only make things worse. It is easy to sell a car to someone when you are done with it, you may have loved the car, but you have a new one that replaces it. However when you try to sell back a husband, you can't have a replacement yet (technically) and people have emotions, and say things and sometimes those things are pretty ugly. <br>  <br>  Yeah it would be a big deal even without religion. But only a person that has never been through a long relationship and divorce would have asked that question. I hope you never feel that pain.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Divorce is difficult regardless of whether or not religion is involved.

The values and belief of a person in religion, marriage and divorce will defer from time to time and from place to place.

Prior to the concept of divorce the only other option for getting out of a marriage was for a spouse to die. whether death occurred by natural causes or by less than conventional means such as murder. I believe religion sets people up for failure. It is a big commitment to say you are only going to be with one person the rest of your life and being with that one person is going to make you happy the rest of your life. Come on lets be real. Their are just to many people in the world to say that only one will make you complete.

Of course through the years people have changed this a bit but in my opinion it should stay just the way it was meant to be. in anycase... You take a vow... if you divorce, you are breaking the vow. WHy make it if it did not really mean that much to you to begin with? If you can not say those words honestly to your bride or groom the day you get married and mean them with all your heart then don't marry the person to begin with. It's that simple. If you do mean them then take them seriously when you are poor and wnat out all of a sudden or one of you gets sick or the better or worse part has come up. Think about that vow you made and don't break it.|`|5hxWSezPaa	It is a big deal - religion or no religion.  Getting married is a pledge to each other to stay together through thick and thin.

You said he was promiscuous before you and that you "had to endure 8 years of listening to who,where,when and how often with everyone else".  To me, that sounds like a pretty adventurous sex life.  Maybe a new technique or a new place (like in a car after dinner) might get him going.<br>  <br>  Also, he's getting older.  Men hit their sexual peak ALOT younger than women do... maybe his post-peak sex drive is really low while your peak is just beginning.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  The answerer after me makes a good point too.  Maybe those were "h*es" so to speak and you're the real deal.

545aba4f8c590e7cd6dc679814dca118aa	Hello!  You just answered my question and asked me to answer yours so here I am!  First of all thank you for reading my long question and responding.  I liked your answer. It was honest and true.  I can relate to your situation because like my question, the guy at my work is average and I kinda had my eye on him for a year.  It wasn't like I really had the hots for him, it was just something about him.  I think your problem is that like you said this girl is "average" and probally not your typical girl that you like, but there is just something about her.  I think that is why you hesitateing to make a move.  You are afraid that if you do, it just may lead to something, and since this girl is "average" and may be different than the girls you usually go after, you may be making a mistake.  So I say take it from me, try it...dont jump in with both feet like I did...take your time. That is what I tried to do and I got pulled in...now I am in the process of breaking the guys heart.  You already broke the ice and talked to her and that is good...maybe take it a step further and give her your number and just say hey give me a call sometime...it is so common now days to exchange cell phone numbers that she may not read to much into it and give you a call.  Thats what happened to me.  But to answer your questions "Yes" I think she knows that you have a interest in her, and she DEFINATLEY has a interest in you just by her actions...the car...standing in line...etc...just take it slow...and I say this because you say this girl is "average" you don't want to hurt her.  Make sure you get to know her and grow into a friendship first...you don't want to get bored and run after the "hot" girls...what you are used to.  You sound very mature and also sound like you are ready for something a little more meaningful and this girl just may be what you are looking for.  Just make sure you are emotionally and physically ready to handle it...take it from me.  I hope I helped...|`|l4AW9OK4aa	tl;dr sorry|`|zx0IQ1Fsaa	ur mid likes her and u r trying to prevent it <br>  let your mind do what it desires, dnt always follow the outer world by dating the hot ones because the average ones are the good ones believe me on that <br>  <br>  <br>  its clear that she likes you and very obvious that u like her on the inside<br>  just talk to her, find her chat id(its not hard on facebook) and just talk your mind <br>  <br>  <br>  also, yes she didn't know that was ur cousin that day in the car so she probably taught u were dating someone else|`|2BBZu2vcaa	she likes you <br>  but it seems like she is waiting for you to make the move <br>  it seems like you like her<br>  ask her to hang out sometime and see how it goes|`|BQ7P9QvBaa	if you dont have much time to spend with her.... go after one of the hotter girls. If you can spend time with her... you like her, no doubt about it. Ask her out. Im guessing that relationship is gonna work :)
NSKimt1Qaa	I, for one, would assume it's just a platonic relationship at this point - hence, the term "emotional friend".  Of course, emotional friend can quickly proceed to emotional and sexual friend if you're in a very unhappy marriage.  You're an open kind of guy so you'll probably spill the beans to us when/if that happens.  I'm pretty sure you can take being roasted by the M&D group.  Some people are always going to assume there's more going on than an emotional friendship with the opposite sex, because that is all they'd be interested in.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I assume that you would not call her your EF, for one thing.  I have a very good friend who is a married man and he would not refer to me in this way.  He would not refer to special cards and lunches (dinners always include his wife, btw) in the context of competition with the wife's...<br>  <br>  You are very well aware that you are sharing something with another woman which is your wife's alone.  You are so completely aware of this that you rub it in the noses of everyone here many times a day.<br>  <br>  Yes, my friend is an EF--for 5 years.  He has saved my practice.  He has brought gifts and things for every occasion--it stopped recently when I got a boyfriend.  I know why--it's because he knew he didn't need to be trying to meet those needs anymore (at least for awhile).  But the whole thing has always included his wife (gifts were from both).  Thank you cards were to both and mailed to their home.|`|WlywfjG1aa	Rather than they assuming what you think it should be ?|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	some people think the worse,, they don;t think men and woman can be just friends,,|`|RcCJSSMPaa	I don't know why they would assume that, but I don't, I know better.

NQFV2AdZaa	He's just stringing you along to be honest. He split with you and slept with two women. Then, knowing that you care for him far more than he does for you, he comes crawling back to you, certain that you'll take him back. I know it's very hard, but you must cut all ties with this user and get out there and make new friends. If you keep letting him walk all over you, you'll be hurting yourself more in the long run. Find new interests to take your mind off him, good luck!|`|zOZ3qeowaa	Ok.. babe... number one hes a loser.. someone like that you dont need.. when me and my ex broke up after a year an a half i found out he was meeting with this other chick... and i asked him about it and he said ''yeah were just friends'' BOLLOX! when a guy says ''friends'' about a girl u never heard of always remember that! <br>  Anyways secondly why you stressing out about him i used to keep thinking of mine too! but uno what one day i sat down and thought ''oh my god? i can so do better i wanna find someone thats gonna love and cherish me! and im gonna cut these guy out my life like a bad habbit!'' and uno what i got everything out of my faced that reminded me of him!

The person that they spent a lifetime loving is now leaving and taking the kids with the possibility of another person parenting them and such.   It is awful.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	Anyone who coould kill there own children is palin and simple nuts!|`|mTl9l3aMaa	They just go nuts.

FmhUZLgoaa	Well you should be honest if the principal asks you and tell him that you were in there going to the bathroom and washing your hand and she did it.|`|5NWgqdmNaa	Just say it wasn't you. If the school persists that it was you just keep denying it. They'll turn to you Friend and mightgetsomething out of her.<br>  They won't know what time you locked the restroom doors so even if they see you walking in the restrooms at a certain time on cameras they won't know its you as loads of people would of walked in since you locked them restrooms.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I once denied sumthing when it was actually me and the school eventually forgot about it.|`|81MgVTicaa	Go see the principal as soon as you can. Like dont be like it was all lacole man. just say i was in there around that time. but i just wanted to clear the air that it wasnt me. idk who it was but i went in there went to the bathroom, everything was peachy. that way you confronted him before he announced anything so he knows its not a cover up.|`|d7bJIgqlaa	As an adult, I have to tell you it is a little funny what she did.  Maybe you and lacole should go to the principal and tell him that she locked them and that you stood there with her (which you did).  You didn't try to talk her out of it.  Apologize and tell him that you all thought it was a funny joke, but are realizing that it wasn't.  <br>  <br>  It's really not that big of a deal.  You didn't hurt anyone, damage anything, or lie (yet).  I think he/she will just give you a warning.
52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	No, If it were a lot, you would seem to be boasting. If it were very little, you would seem like a whiner.<br>  NO...|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	My kids are on a need to know basis with our finances.<br>  <br>  My 13 year old is the family materialist.  If he hears that he can't have something he wants, he'll pitch a fit about how we're hoarding money.  My husband sat him down once and gave him a long lecture on the budget.  My son didn't like the talk much and tried to whine that he should still get what he wants.  So my husband gave him the lecture again :P<br>  <br>  By the end of the night, my son was running around the house telling his siblings to turn off lights when they were done and suggesting that we could get by without home phone service.<br>  <br>  Now, whenever he gets in a whiny mood, my husband asks him if he wants to go over the budget to see if there's room and he shuts up pretty quick.  It's sort of a family joke now.<br>  <br>  Other than that though, my kids usually don't know about the budget.  They don't get things that we can afford pretty often just because they don't need it and we're not in the business of spoiling them.  I also don't like them to be stressed when we're having a hard time making ends meet, which has happened here and there.<br>  <br>  As for teaching them about budgeting, we do that with their money rather than ours.  All of them do odd jobs for spending money.  We occasionally "hire" them for extra chores around the house if we know they're itching for something special.  Both of our parents did the same thing for us and we believe that it taught us how to be driven toward a goal and also how to make sacrifices to get something that you really want.|`|ITJtxINpaa	I don't know how much my dad makes, but I am happy with what I am now, normal and satisfied.|`|xF6aTbDVaa	I know & I'm 16... I don't think it would ever hurt to tell your kids about that kind of stuff, they have to learn some day, right?|`|AA10039322	I think it's very important for kids to know the value of a dollar....I personally let my 3 kids in on all the financial situations here at home! The house payment, electric bill, phone bill, etc. etc..........Getting them involved with how the world really is and how responsibilities are important to survive is great parenting skills!|`|Y9nJxRlpaa	no i did not and they are just kids and therefore it is none of their business whatsoever. because they cant conrtribute to the morgage being paid!!!|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	I never knew what my mother made but it wouldn't have made a difference to me if I had known because I honestly had no idea of what the value of what she was making had.<br>  <br>  I knew enough to know that she didn't make enough for us to own our own place and she was just barely making enough for us to live in a decent place just short of being a slum.  I knew we went hungry sometimes because there wasn't enough money and she made too much to get public assistance.  And when she remarried, hers and my stepfather's combined incomes (mostly his) were enough to greatly change out standard of living.<br>  <br>  I actually don't think knowing what your parents do or don't make is a burden that children need to be aware of.  I think that they only need to know that their needs are being taken care of and that they should have to contribute to their wants, so that they have a better understanding of the value of things.  Depending on the age of the child, things like rent or mortgage, utility bills, and grocery bills may be too abstract a thing for them to understand but I do see the benefit of an older child, say a teenager knowing about these kinds of things.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	Yes when my oldest was 10, I showed them my check and then sat down to the kitchen table and wrote a list of the bills and all out going money so they would know how much we had left ( I was kinda broke ) for other emergency's and also so they would learn to budget money.
iPNOVR6Gaa	Here in Marriage & Divorce, we have to put up with a lot of single people "asking questions" with the attitude that marriage is "just a piece of paper".  But if you have children, and if you want to have legal access to your children, that piece of paper suddenly becomes critically important, as your question so powerfully points out.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	All I know is that when a school has this kind of issue brought to them - a parent is required to present court documentation showing that they have custody.  If the parent can't produce documentation showing legal custody - the school assumes that both parents retain rights to the children.  This is in CT.  I would think that the only way to do that is to go to court and get some order of custody - in whatever form that may be (temporary, emergency or final declaration).  <br>  <br>  If the parents weren't married and the child has a different last name than the father, I would assume that most people would give the father a hard(er) time when it comes to the custody issues...may not be legally correct, but I'm going on what most people would assume.|`|0LvWiESWaa	It may not be about rights as much as it is about a formality. Children are part of the paper process like the property is when a marriage is dissolved. <br>  <br>  How many mothers and children are removed from a house that is owned by the father because the parents are not married? Had they married, she would have rights to the home. However, unlike fathers and children in that situation, she has no legal standing except maybe in a state where common law marriage is factored in.|`|Q5tq5WOKaa	Sorry but I don't have knowledge about the law in America.But in my country Philippines,usually,when parents got separated (no legal divorce) parents-in-law has the big role in taking care of the children.|`|2fc070d6eb43cae314c87ae191954e20aa	all of them
OeRzlZPnaa	You two can always try to play some kinky games to get him to try different things, or just to get him more comfortable with sex. I'm not talking about kinky sex positions or anything I'm talking about games like strip poker, dice, or whatever else you can find out there. That way it's not just you acting like you have more expierence but kind of a joint sex adventure. Another thing you can do is read sex tips together kind of as a how can we make our bedroom expierence better or just sit together and decide to try a new position. The main key is to have it be a joint venture so when you do it make it like it's for both of you. And about the teeth, that'll probably take some time and I wouldn't worry about it as long as he keeps making progress about being more comfortable around you about it, even if it is baby steps.|`|bELskj1Gaa	Are you fat?

udPtqagzaa	Honestly? Don't flaunt off your fancy stuff - make a joke, hold her smile and keep the eye-contact.

Then walk away, but look back to see if she's noticing you. Whenever you bump into eachother again, say something, or smile.

This might be correct, so examine that possibility, and when you talk with her, be sure she knows that the attention she is getting comes not from her fascination with Nazis but from your heart and your love for her.  <br>  <br>            May the best possible results come of this event in your lives.|`|v4ocLWpKaa	its typical teenage stuff im 20 so im a recent teenager lol and it soudns liek she just wants to fit in...as for the nazi situation i love learning about that kind of stuff it is part of her heritage so she is probly just interested in learning more about it i wouldnt worry about it at all|`|NqMmvvgVaa	I think she is just trying to rebel, prove to you that she can go against you in be different.

You like her sense of security. She found this guy that sounds great but then again he might just not be so great sooner or later and I think she knows that. I just say she's wanting you around because she does care about you. But she also wants to be with other people.. I don't know if that helps any.. Good luck. :)

He'd call when he has time, though and that would be some time when he wasn't backed up or busy during the day and if you're trying to put someone on a time schedule to call you, I see big time problems in this relationship.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	My boy friend is out of town every weekend for 3-4 days and rarely called me and I never called him (my rule) and I had told him it was nice to hear his voice at least once a day, but I didn't make a big issue about it, I just noticed when he didn't...<br>  <br>  He brought a big problem (not cheating) into the thing and I told him I was done and this past weekend he called me:<br>  on the way to the airport<br>  from Chicago<br>  at bedtime<br>  woke me up at 7 am on Saturday (oh I was thrilled)<br>  at his next layover<br>  at his next layover<br>  at his next layover<br>  bedtime<br>  repeat Sunday<br>  this morning from Chicago heading to Providence<br>  <br>  I guess my answer (although not a man) is that it isn't worth it to let the one you love think you don't love her... But if you're the wife, don't make this too big, either.  He's working.|`|OG4410bdaa	my husband used to work a 5am to 5pm job<br>  he called me usually around 7or8 when I woke up to say "good morning" then he'd call me again around noon to see how my day was going<br>  <br>  now he works 8am to 5pm<br>  so he only calls me once around 11:30 when he goes on lunch...sometimes he even comes home to eat lunch with me, about once a week|`|IvMPh09baa	9AM to 11PM??? <br>  <br>  How is someone possibly married with that type of work schedule?<br>  <br>  sorry... but if you are working that much, that means you are not at home... thus... you are married to your job, not your wife.|`|mFYBg5BKaa	I'd text her almost all day.. but call her only on the way to meet my girlfriend for lunch sex...|`|6b0361fd65c600b0617b3884ebc87b1eaa	9 to 11 that's a sweat shop, right?|`|5hxWSezPaa	1152AM on the dot|`|AA10774661	Noon or lunch break|`|f36bb855b6fe4f58fc6b6148329e13a6aa	Well depends on the job. I have days like that and I never get a reasonable chance to cal my boyfriend, which makes him angry. I work in a man's field and he gets jealous of all the guys that see me all day long. However I have some days that are so slow I can talk for hours at anytime in the day. Like today I could talk to him, but he is actually at work and can't talk to me. <br>  <br>  You just do the best you can, and don't get upset with your partner over it. That only tears apart your relationship. However if that is his schedule everyday, than maybe you need to find a way to help him get a different job or maybe you need to find a way to supplement his income so he doesn't have to work like that. <br>  <br>  I don't know your situation, and maybe neither option is available, but if you are so concerned with his hours and not calling then I suggest trying to find  way to reduce the hours, the need for the hours, or the job that prevents him from calling, rather than get angry that he works so hard to make the money for you to have internet and write perfect strangers about his schedule.|`|2ftssJmGaa	I would call before noon . maybe before she is out of bed and tell her how much you would like to be in bed with her..|`|PS9JIKR7aa	maybe lunch time?<br>  thats a ridiculous shift.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	That's a long day.<br>  <br>  If my husband had time, he'd probably call me around lunch time.  Otherwise he'd just call me on his way home.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	IS there a reason he would have to call her?  <br>  <br>  I'm quite capable of making it through the work day without "having" to call or be called by my spouse.
60Zcdr2uaa	I would say it could be a mixture of things. <br>  1. Yes they actually do find you attractive<br>  2. They glanced over saw you looking and the one thing that would make it obvious that they were looking in the first place would be to look away, so they dont<br>  3 They are being slightly flirty with you.<br>  4 They wonder why YOU are looking at them<br>  <br>  <br>  At the end of the day eye contact is a great thing. though sometimes it can be misread  so be careful :)|`|m4PeQtVLaa	they're just strange..|`|NxZl1Qccaa	you had something on your face maybe.....

nDSLNnguaa	The only thing you can do is cry for a really long time until it makes you sick.  Listen to some sad music and then cry some more. THEN pick yourself up and get into something that interests you, call your friends and tell them you want to do something and move on.  Cry when you think of him and get lonely but don't think of him constantly and know that there really are more fish in the sea.  Some are better catches than other but they are out there just the same.<br>  <br>  So sorry for you sweetie! :((((
941e5f6681cc5afaaf6fe7770eccb4acaa	Remember just because a guy doesn't like you back doesn't mean your not worth his time it just means that he's not the one for you and sooner or later you will find somebody who truly deserves you.|`|jN1gsgRAaa	I've def been in dis situation before...avoid being places that he mite be at. Focus you attention on other things or guys besides him. Stay busy. Get rid of anything that may remind you of him. Just do anything besides think about him. It's just best to go out, hang with friends and find someone new who actually likes you back. It also helps to treat yourself and focus on yourself more. <br>  <br>  And remember just because a guy doesn't like you back doesn't mean your not worth his time it just means that he's not the one for you and sooner or later you will find somebody who truly deserves you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! =)|`|AeLT0lLFaa	I would personally start looking at some other guys, and think there are so many nice, cute/hot guys out there for me!

155bc8c47b6ea8173ed60e21cb549f5eaa	He is most likely worried about you because you have to eat... he might have some feelings towards you as well... I know that "the belly" is always a problem with girls but not eating something will do damage to yourself, just get a salad or something small and healthy. as much as you like chocolate milk though, try not to drink as much (if you drink a lot) chocolate doesn't help lose weight (as good as it is)<br>  <br>  hope I helped and good luck with the friend!!|`|CRozjN6vaa	He feels deserted. You were his lunch buddy and cutting foods is one thing but your cutting him out to. If you want harmony to be restored go through the line with him, and don't tell him what not to eat. Each to their own, together. If you think he's not worth it, then you've learned that.|`|M7H6QMJQaa	He likes you, he's interested in you. He likes you just the way that you are and he doesn't want you to worry about your "belly" because he wants you to feel about your body the way he feels. He doesn't like to see you unhappy or deprived. Give up on the diet and kiss him instead.

I think you have more reason to be upset than him, because he backed out of plans to meet them.  And I agree, discussing things by text is immature, so tell him to come see you tonight so you can talk in person about what he did.|`|V6CFNRRvaa	hes pissed off that you were all like ill tell you later instead of just telling him there and then.|`|OAYaeW22aa	ya hes really pissed|`|kXPmr9oDaa	i think he is mad. sorry :(|`|l50LNHYKaa	when guys do something wrong and u aknowledge them for that, they feel emberassed that they try to make it like ur making it a big deal. what he did was wrong and u have every right to be mad about it. when u are starting something with a new person, meeting the family is the most important thing. the fact that he backed out last min i know ur mom and sis in theyr back of their heads well for them it was a bad first impression. if he backed out now he might back out in many other situations and then the whole relationship will go to waste. if he texts u back and he thinks u are taking this way to seriously calmly tell him ur not and that what he did was wrong, if u can depend on him now why should u still b with him if u dontk now u can depend on him later on right??

The age gap will have it's challenges, but if you share common interests he might appreciate a young persons view on things he has not looked at in that way in a long time, or wasn't something he had to deal with when he was your age.|`|a6kZ2q8Kaa	There is a possible problem when he is 19 years older than you in old age - but maybe not. Otherwise it might be great.

He has to be into you just as much as you are into him. My ex-husband is 15 years older then me and we hooked up when I was just 18. So yes it can happen that you can get an older man but he has to meet what you like in older men just like you have to meet what he likes in younger women. Just be patient and wait.|`|27ylepZLaa	You will have no problem getting older men. But be sure they are not married.<br>  <br>  Younger women always seem to connect with married men and leave the single guys alone.|`|g3pGZEw9aa	Yep!

vyNlyfczaa	sorry to say it but I agree with the parent! You are too young to get married! Like you wrote you broke up recently.... first of all - work your relationship, built a strong relationship and then think about getting married! If you really want to get marry - get engaged for couple years first! Good luck|`|aXYiOskmaa	what's the hurry? you're both so young. experience life first.do it  together if you like but at least do some living. at 20, even though you think of yourselves as "adults", you really need to do some more growing up.
dsalP9hiaa	Listen to your alarm bells. I had exactly the same situation and my exploding resentment at his tight fisted ways finally erupted! Give him a test. See how far you have to push him until he puts his hand in his pocket. To me, as with you and your family, a relationship includes caring and sharing. This is so fundamental that without it I could see no real future for us. Think about how he makes you feel. Does his mean streak make you feel under valued and unloved? Talk by all means but a word of warning...when my money 'dried up' I was called a leech! My resentment and anger was only compounded by the debt I found myself in after almost two years of putting up with the tight wad. Do you find that his mean ways are not restricted to money? My experience led me to acknowledge that his lack of generousity stretched to other areas, for example, his lack of empathy and inability to think of others at all. Is he selfish in other ways? Talk...if he'll listen. Good luck. Just don't expect that this situation will rectify itself. I thought that but it just got worse. This is my first time on here, I just had to msg you having been there. Who knows maybe you can be a positive influence and teach this man the joy of giving and sharing.|`|yiUNN8ADaa	Sweetie, if it bothers you THIS much, you know he's not right for you. It's hard when you've been with someone for so long, but if he were the one, you two wouldn't clash so much on money issues. No relationship is perfect, but you have to find someone who agrees with you on important issues like this. Good luck!|`|rZ9Oa5wfaa	Maybe he doesn't know that he is doing this. I would talk to him and try to work things out, but if things don't change I would get the hell out of there before you waste anymore time with him.|`|89d3bf3b50a93d03e19347179f7c0974aa	it's called control over the relationship. Nothing more. Most relationship when someone controls the money....they are usually in control of the relationship.|`|NxZl1Qccaa	i think you should talk to him,he needs to know how you feel and maybe if you make him understand he might change.|`|ea7e0e269d284b25319c50afbd1598f2aa	i think if u r a christian u  should pray God for him maybe some devil spirits make him do that.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Money is one of the BIG THREE things that most often cause serious problems in a relationship.  <br>  <br>  I suggest couples/marriage counseling.   Without resolution, the problem will get worse and eventually destroy the relationship.<br>  <br>  You know and I know that there is a big difference between being frugal and being stingey (tight).  He can learn with professional help.|`|hHndD5SEaa	oh girl I feel your pain!! I dated a guy like this before, and it drove me mad! Im a very generous person - probably too generous for my own good, but he really really got to me! I started to dread going out with him as I knew it would be me that would end up footing the bill! Ill never forget one night - we went to the cinema - he actually bought the tickets - but made me pay for a bottle of water that Id picked up - it was the ephiny of meanness!!!!<br>  I hate to asy it but I dont think that this guy is capable of change - mean people rarely are. Its an embarassing topic to address, but I think youll have to - just tell him that you cant continue paying the bulk of things in the relationship and that he needs to start dipping into his communion money!! lol!!!<br>  xx|`|c8MYNPdBaa	There's not a lot you can really do to change this in my experience, some people are just mean with their money! All you can do is explain to him that there's more to life than money and giving money brings more happiness than hoarding it. This is hard to bring up but if it is getting in the way of your relationship than its important you do.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|AA11356977	Your use to being spoiled , doesnt mean your guy has to do the same. Do you work? If not get a job to b uy what you want. Others dont have to always give to your.  Some guys are just tight with cash. My friends husband has beent hat way for their whole marriage.|`|3821763c4b7e0b53c9e3c5fcbac4f9b1aa	Can you change yourself? The answer will be a big  NO. Then how can you expect him to change? Accept him for what he is. He is not your twin to think and behave the same way as you do. Since most part of your relationship other than this particular aspect (concerning money) is okay for you, you should not have any regrets; rather you should be happy. Do meditation. You will be very peaceful with you as well as with others around you. Wish you all the best!|`|u1Oi6tGHaa	I don't know how serious you want to become with this relationship, but if you're thinking about marriage, then this is a huge problem.  Financial stress is one of the biggest relationship killers.  If you both don't have the same views, goals and discipline about finances, you could be in for a bumpy ride.  Talk to him seriously about it and decide if you two are a good match in this area.
1c25f0773926f8cde3f71d5867bbbc1eaa	In theory, boys and girls shouldn't be calling each other names, but they do anyway.  However, I do think there is a subtle difference in the way the boys and girls see dating.  Girls are supposed to be the gate-keepers, it is the boy that proposes and it is the girls that disposes.  So, it's like American Idol, the boy sing and dances, and the girl renders a judgement.  Hence, the girl feel it's perfectly fine to explain why she is turning down the boy.  The boy, being up on the stage, isn't supposed to be judging the judges.|`|MV88rqDPaa	because calling a gurl fat is like your judging by how big or small she is and your like saying how come your that big and stuff like dat n plus girlz are more sensitve then boyz|`|A94u2In8aa	I agree with you...if a girl is fat then there should'nt be a problem in calling her fat.But women are generally sensitive creatures and some tend to ignore their flaws.So dont call a girl fat unless you wanna hurt her feelings.If you dont wanna date someone whos fat then dont date her..its your choice but dont go around publicising it.And i would'nt tell a guy hes short to his face.Id probably just make up another reason that isnt related to his physical appearance..id probably say something like im not ready to commit yet or something...are you getting what im saying?|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Sometimes weight issues really make a girl feel unattractive. Maybe she is one of those girls. I don't feel anyone should judge a person on appearance because they could be missing out on meating a great person. It's what is inside that truly matters.|`|K8JGxwGXaa	Because, poeple are so "sensitive" and everyones feelings matter.. if shes fat, then shes fat!  thats her own damn problem, not yours.  Just tell people to eff off.|`|89d3bf3b50a93d03e19347179f7c0974aa	Because women are snesitive and your not suppose to call them fat
hrU14wMDaa	There's reason why you broke up. Just remember that. It's good though that you still feel love for them as it is easier on our body than holding onto a lot of hate. Obviously the relationship wasn't the right one to be in. Get yourself out there and meet new people. Have fun dating and learning about new people and learning about what you like in a relationship.  Things do get easier and you will grow as person as a result of it.|`|bvgCKjnsaa	There is really no gauge on telling when it is over... But I think there is mutual understanding that it is over. It is also dependent upon the person. Men generally can move0on faster than women.

If the other person had wanted it to work they would have been there for you and you wouldn't even have to wonder if "It's over."  If one person does not try, then they do not really love you-so I would say it is over.  People just have to keep in the back of their mind when someone wasn't there, or didn't try.  I'm not saying carry around anger-but it is important and you hurt a lot less in life if you just do not forget if someone is not a real friend or does not love you.

Marriage to them now is just a tax thing. <br>  <br>  Marriages were never "sweeter", and they lasted longer because many women were expected to accept being physically and mentally abused, and were to accept their husband's indiscretions. Many women also feared the "wrath of God" to request a divorce, and were afraid to because they would have no money to raise their children. Up until the very late 1800's, in some states, men were allowed to kill their wives if they found them cheating.<br>  <br>   I live with my fiance. They only reason why we are in such a rush to get married now is because of health insurance. His is much better then mine. We have no house, and certainly no children, but that is due to where we live, not being able to afford a house, and we don't want children. We fell in love very quickly, very, very quickly. We started a business together within five months of our relationship, his disabled ( not  that disabled, too tired to clean up after herself, but no to shop from 9-6)selfish, lazy mother lives with us, so we went through, and are still going through the challenges that break many a marriage.<br>  <br>  Thumbs down because you don't agree with what I am doing or thumbs down because you don't believe in the truth of how women were expected to grin and bear it?|`|asxqampCaa	All of the goofy selfish immature greedy idiots of this generation have turned it around. <br>  <br>  Correct order: <br>  <br>  Get to know someone - date for an extended period of  time exclusively - get married - build career - buy home - have kids <br>  <br>  Current order: met some person - know them 3 hours before sex and 6 weeks total - get knocked up - get married - cheat - get divorced - repeat until uterus falls out<br>  <br>  <br>  Has nothing to do with being "christian" - has everything to do with being mature, intelligent, and in control of your clit/pecker.<br>  <br>  <br>  Quick note: Anyone who uses "Future (insert dream job)" - it never happens.

We are happier than my 4 sisters! And btw. I was 17 my husband was 20.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	*shrugs* If you are single and can afford a house why wait until you are married. I would never co-own a house with someone I wasn't married to.  The non-owner should simply be a "renter" who does not pay for maintenance.<br>  <br>  Be that as it may, I do feel people need to NOT have kids until they are married.|`|jBigEy0Caa	My husband already had a child before we met, but we got married, bought a house, then had more kids.  I do know others who have done it differently and they seem to be just fine.|`|CQsD09D6aa	You say that marriages used to be 'sweeter'. Not necessarily. Nowadays people are getting married older and have more options such as careers etc. This means they spend more time being single which is not necessarily a bad thing.|`|dprURFLxaa	If I would've planned it maybe, but I was pregnant first and that's just the way it happened.  Who knows...maybe I wouldn't have married him if we didn't have kids...I think the devil made me do it.  ★|`|0UUDFxR0aa	Yes
d1TTwwUUaa	Your just feeling overwhelmed. You don't know how to accept all this. He loves you tremendously. Enjoy it. Seel couple counseling if need be. Don't push him away. Sit him down and explain how much you love him and you know how he loves you. Your just like I said overwhelmed and having a hard time with this because of your past. Let him know you'll never leave him also, but you need time to absorb all of this or seek sometype of counseling to adjust to it. Don't ever let him think you don't want this. You have no idea what a catch you have.  Good luck and be happy|`|bf6K6uubaa	i suggest counseling for you to get over your guardedness and allow yourself to be treated like a queen...the otehr thing you can do is tell  your man that u need some space..that you love that he loves you but you don't want to be overwhelmed with love...and if you explain it gently and honestly he wont get offended.|`|eSkNDqLKaa	Your problem is that you don't feel worthy of receiving the love, clearly because your background didn't show it.  You may want to talk to someone that can help you learn to love yourself and to learn to accept love!  Best of Luck!|`|AkUhaMm9aa	I think you understand whats happening here..at least you are not in denial and you realized you might be pushing him away...that's a good start..<br>  what you need to understand is that you are very special...sometimes we dont see each ourselves like that..but you have to learn to love and appreciate yourself a little more..or maybe you have had previous bfs that didn't demonstrate their love like that..and you are not used to it now..you just have to be happy because you are obviously lucky, if you feel like you need your space then talk to him not everyone likes to express their love the same way it doesn't mean you love him less..you probably show you affection in a different ways...what ever is bothering you, you need to talk to him and tell him that you dont want to push him away, tell him that you love him but be honest about what is bothering you..|`|TiOsIfi7aa	well, just try to forget about the past. Just think your past is not important. whats important is Right now and future. it is all in your hands you can make a great future for yourself and this man . try to appreciate him, love him as much as he loves you. forget about the little things that bother you. think about the Big picture " happiness of you both" thats all that matter <br>  <br>  <br>  Enjoy :)|`|mkrKHQvFaa	Ok this sounds like a wierd question but do you love yourself?  Alot of people can not handle the love others give them because they are not happy with themselves.  It is a hard one to answer but until you figure out how to accept his love it might be a strain in your relationship.  If you want to keep your relationship and make it healthy you may even need to seek counseling.  Good luck!|`|cLrY0O4Uaa	Oh hunny, you are so lucky! Try treating him too, take him out to dinner, or make him dinner! Make little gifts for him, do things to show him how much YOU care!|`|HrttKKySaa	Honey I felt the same way. I did grow up with a loving family, however I was in a very bad abusive relationship for a while and was literally ripped apart. As a result I has issues with my my now husband thinking he would leave, or that one day it would all just happen again that he would start being abusive in every way possible as I had before. <br>  You're not a ***** I'm pretty sure I really understand where you are. I was very scared even though it has been many man years latter and I had had previous relationships. I didn't think that someone would truly love me enough to STAY, and be a GOOD man. I hope that makes since. I loved my bf/fiance/husband so very much, and kept putting off the possibility of getting married because of my unresolved things, althogh I didn't see that was the reason at the time. I hate getting help, but sometimes you need to. I think the breaking point was going to one amazing counselor for premarital couseling stuff before we got married. That was a huge help. We didn't talk about my past really just acknowledge it and worked through the problems that it caused in our relationship.<br>  Even if they time he tells you that he isn't leaving and your head screams yes, tell yourself it has to be true. And think about doing some premarital counseling, you don't have to go into you're past, but you have to acknowledge the problems, and potential problems that it may create in the future.<br>  There is a lot to life, a relationship, and a marriage...do everything you can.<br>  <br>  I hope that is helpful, you can e-mail me if that doesn't make since or want to talk more. <br>  <br>  ~Hannah <br>  Bananaslugg@gmail.com|`|fPLv0QrSaa	Imagine if you grew up without playing golf and then later in life you start dating someone who likes golf. You try to play golf but you suck. The way to fix this would be to take golf lessons from a golf pro.<br>  <br>  Since you didn't experience much love growing up you are likely to have trouble with it now. I would talk to your doctor about seeing a therapist. A therapist can help you understand love. They can help you sort through your feelings and instruct you on how to love better.|`|vO4uvoYBaa	wow, you need help, in a good way you have a man that gives you everything and worship the ground you walk on you said you luv em, whats the problem, you said it yaself im madly in luv with him, you just tripping, you neva had someone show you luv and affection before and you dont know how to handle it, after 4 years you would think everything would be ok, snap outta it and live ya live he aint going nowhere.|`|AA11380378	He sounds emotionally co-dependant and also very insecure. He shoudl have a life outside his relationship and it seems suffocating and exhausting to have someone 24/7 on your case.<br>  <br>  I don't know about you, but I need my space. It seems creepy to me that some one is unable to live without the constant reassurance of a relationship. <br>  <br>  This obsession is quite unhealtly, your senses are right!<br>  <br>  Good luck

vn2Lq7hIaa	Sounds like the two of you have made a sub-conscious bond together. <br>  I've heard of that before but I believe it involved identical twins.<br>  <br>  It seem like an ideal relationship enhancer; both tired - both go to sleep both hungry - both eat, both horny - have great sex unless you both have a headache at the same time.

Why didn't u take the initiative?|`|Di6FAQxRaa	I think because your conversation wasnt boring, and maybe he didnt want to sleep yet, you was keeping him company. Ask him, its not a complicated question. Say "hey i thought you were tired last night, but you stayed on the phone with me, i appreciated that, how come u stayed up? " Thats simple enough for him to answer and you gave him a compliment also, so u should get a good answer, instead of having us guess,lol.|`|uFmrZbCbaa	Maybe you should have just respected the fact that he was tired and let him go, or are you one of the controlling types and just had to keep talking.

And a world famous city.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	The same reason why you get a larger student loan if you're studying in London v the rest of the UK - it's more expensive to be there and has a higher cost of living.  Businesses charge whatever the going rate is in any specific place, and with wages being higher, housing prices being higher, tourism being an important factor etc in London, it makes everything go up in price across the board.|`|79wOWoM0aa	I'm sure it has more to do with the venues and services, not London itself.<br>  <br>  Unless London has a ￡7000 marriage tax.

RtkB46peaa	The key here is, was it "against your will", you said "no" in your sleep, and then admit that you then started moaning like you liked it.  It sounds to me that this was not sexual abuse in the context you're insinuating, but merely a situation that happened because you and your husband don't communicate very well.  Believe it or not, some women like it rough.|`|u1uECuFNaa	I consider it to be.<br>  You say no, it means no. <br>  Always. <br>  Next time, you should make yourself heard...and perhaps pull his hands away....use one of his fingers...or reach out and grab him....<br>  No..nevermind...bad idea. Just say no and move.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Any "touching" that is unwanted is abuse and or assualt, no means no, even in a marriage.|`|msNXomjTaa	I'm not convinced that the situation you describe is actual abuse (although it does come close).  However, you can absolutely be abused in marriage.  There once were laws stating that you could not deny a spouse sex, but this has changed, and sex when one says no (and means it) is sexual assault (or rape).<br>  <br>  However, sex can be rough and tumble, and the line between the norms for a couple and abuse can be a bit blurry, like in your case.  If you moan, he would take that as an indication of your pleasure, despite any pain.  Proving this was abuse would be pretty tricky.  However, you have an absolute right to say no, and if he ignores this, he can be charged.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	If ANY person hurts you or touches you sexually against your will, it is abuse.|`|PHYj1UPwaa	Relax..he's your husband..he pro thought you were responding to him...It was not abuse...|`|AA11205208	No means no.<br>  <br>  Touching someone who is asleep and cannot consent is wrong.<br>  <br>  Yes, he molested you. No, it is not okay because he is your husband.<br>  <br>  your husband probably doesn't think it is a big deal but you obviously do. Particularly since it hurt and has caused you pain. You need to sit down with him and explain that this is NOT OKAY. that you do not want to be touched in your sleep. <br>  <br>  If he still doesn't get it you may want to try counseling.|`|5mTKspfYaa	you admited that you were giving him mixed messages...  so it's your fault it didn't stop.<br>  <br>  no means no, no matter what your relationship to the other person is...<br>  <br>  if you feel uncomfortable then say no and stick to it.  if someone continues after that point it is abuse.  don't be a victim, you deserve better|`|mTl9l3aMaa	It's abuse, he hurt you, you didn't like it, it's abuse!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I thought your bipolar boyfriend was beating you up this morning?

45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	I think she does not like you. I am sorry but I think she does not want to hurt your feelings! I think that she is lying to you about everything. I think she feels bad and sees you like her and would treat her right and she wants you as a back up. She cheated on her bf by kissing you she is no good. I mean she keeps going back to a man who beats her and treats her like crap. She needs a friend to talk to and I think if she does like you she will not pick you over her bf. Tell her you can not stand by and let her be with someone else while you have the feelings that you have for her so she is going to have to choose.

wpi36XBAaa	It could be one of four things:-<br>  1. He doesn't see himself as part of the problem so he doesn't have to fix it. He sees it as up to you to "work" on the marriage.<br>  2. He doesn't see the problem at all, so to him there's nothing that needs fixing..<br>  3. He doesn't believe in counseling, or doesn't believe that it can/will change anything. He could be scared of what it may involve. May think it will be too touchy/feely for him to handle.<br>  4. He doesn't care enough to fix this. He wants it done with.<br>  As to what it could be, it may be best to ask him straight out "Do you see us staying together into the future?". "Do you see a problem with our relationship?", and "Do you think its worth fixing/improving?"|`|WLLvMY3iaa	Not really enough info or even a real question but marriage counseling doesn't work with only one person going.Either he doesn't feel comfortable going or he doesn't want to improve the relationship.

Do not take it personally that he will not go with you to counseling.  It is just a man's nature.  Besides, if he admits there is a problem, than he will have to deal with it and he may not be ready, emotionally, to do that yet.  Give him time and continue to go by yourself.  Find yourself, again, and he will follow suit.  Smile, obtain a great attitude, and love him regardless and he will see the difference in you and want that for himself.  Become the self confident woman you should be and he will notice that too.  Believe in yourself, and your husband and your marriage.  I know how hard it is to feel that you are alone in your quest for mending your marital problems, but he will come around if you maintain a positive attitude and smile in the face of adversity.  It may seem impossible, but it can be done.  I will be praying for you and good luck|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	Going yourself  will help you to understand your feelings and motivations. If he is not prepared to go it maybe that he is afraid of what he'll find out about himself and your relationship. You can not force him to go, but if he is unwilling it would suggest that he is not prepared to work on your problems. He probably believes (rightly or wrongly) that there are none that he is prepared to face..|`|0d0W0nbVaa	most men would rather divorce their wives than go through marriage counseling.   next question?|`|dPk7dr7laa	Ok, I know that I have answered with this a couple times to other questions but watch the movie Fire Proof. Do the Love dare challenge. You can buy it at any book store or online. Your husband will notn have to do anythong at first. It is all you. Watch the movie to see how it works. It is an awesome movie about this guy whose marriage is falling apart. he and his wife fight all the time. He talked to his dad about it and his dad sent him this handwritten journal with a "Love Dare" and the husband has to read it each day (30 or 40 days I can't remember) and do what ever the challenge for the day was no matter how silly or embarrassing it would be for him. The father told him not to worry and keep doing this consistantly and don't give up no matter what his wife says or does. The husband did everythign  and seriously watch the movie now, today. You can buy it at Wallymart or rent it at the movie store. Do it now. I reccomend it and I just know it will work for you.|`|UINoUgbWaa	You are doing what you need to do for your marriage.<br>  Why not have the counselor come by the house?

sbeoF50gaa	Give her a journal book, and in the first page YOU write a good memory of the two of you. Tell her it's her turn, and you two can share a journal. Eventually she will write the truth because writing is always easier than talking.|`|6Ss31wyBaa	she needs therapy|`|vRqrImroaa	Honestly you just have to let her come to you. Pressuring her into saying what is wrong (which i don't believe you are doing) will just make less likely to tell you her feelings. Just let her know you are always there for her and that you would do anything for her and just be a good friend. That's about all you can really be|`|Lv9rLFgwaa	come on lightly whilst suggesting her to tell you, if you truley want to help, which im sure you do, then just keep reassuring her that you'll be there for her, and help her out.<br>  hope this helps x|`|vLQ5sPJ9aa	Carefully...|`|oQkwZhXpaa	I do it..I do exactly that and it upsets the guy I like because he thinks its because I don't trust him that I can't tell him..<br>  <br>  Relax because its not that..she probably worships the ground you walk on because you are there for her. And that is very important. You need to hold her and let her know you'll be there for her if theres anything she wants to talk about, and eventually, she will start to open up, but once she has started to tell you, you need to to be patient and understanding because its been in there for a long long time, and its ot all just going to go away overnight.You'll need to be there for her as much as you can.<br>  <br>  Another reason she might be doing this is because she wants to be in control and she doesnt want people to know how she is feeling. She may have suffered in the past with bullying or something, and wants to keep her emotions and thoughts to herself so that she doesnt end up getting hurt.<br>  <br>  She may also have suffered something serious like abuse, which she ay not want to tell anyone about through fear of repercussions, but i'm more inclined to go with the above reasons. All I ever wanted was someone who cared and someone who listened. Therapy doesnt always have to happen. Talking and being held when you cry are mostly enough. <br>  <br>  Just be a nice guy. You sound like you care a lot and I'm sure your friend can see this, and will tell you in time. Just reassure her that its OK to get upset, and that you wont be angry with her, your there for her no matter what and you just want to help, and that talking will help her. <br>  <br>  Good luck :) You'll be fine :)|`|JtaWDdWyaa	I know this might be obvious but she might be scared to get hurt again and maybe she shuts close because she doesn't want to be hurt by you.

Sometimes that is enough.|`|SqPp6MD3aa	this is most likely because she likes the attention you're giving her. this isn't a bad thing. what i'm trying to say is that maybe she's been ignored by loved ones and now that you're asking her what's wrong, she doesn't know how to respond.<br>  <br>  just BE THERE AND HOLD HER IN YOUR ARMS SOME MORE. she may not react outwardly, but inside of her, she appreciates what you're doing for her. even just asking her how her day was and listening to the answer speaks tremendous volume in her eyes that you're wiliing to be audience. <br>  <br>  also, maybe plan a picnic or somehting outdoors. she seems like she needs UV rays. JK|`|bEWyl3Jiaa	im like that sometimes.. not as bad. but i understand it is fustrating for other people. <br>  pnce someone has a wall built up its hard to 'knock it down', and it just seems easier/ natural sometimes for people to just shove it off and pretent everything is alright. <br>  your friend knows or should know that she can talk to you when she feels like it, so she should in her own time. so you just gotta give it time i guess, if there is something really bothering her she will just come out with it. maybe if you open up to her a bit more it will be easier for her to open up to you, like knowing you can trust her she'll find trust in you. :)

It will probably disappoint him a little.<br>  <br>  So show your excitement for it and just tell him you found it on accident (and couldn't wait for him to get home to thank him...or whatever else you want to add). Thats what he was going for in the first place.|`|pRF5LLloaa	Don't destroy his joy in giving it to you!  If you are  truly in love you would NEVER do anything to cause distress to the one you love.

I think sleeping with a different person you don't know every night of the week is a bit much but apart from that as long as you're careful and protect yourself then I say go for it. After all how are you supposed to find the perfect person if you don't have a little fun? <br>  I just reckon that you should make sure you're comfortable with things/situations before you do anything, if you aren't than don't. There is no point of putting yourself in the position to feel bad about yourself. Sex is about discovery and you shouldn't feel uncomfortable about it if it's what you want to do. <br>  I'm 19 now, I've only slept with 2 people, and only recently lost my virginity. I look back and I don't regret it as I know it's what I wanted at the time. <br>  Sex with someone without there being a relationship isn't a bad thing.

29hcn9JRaa	Most marriages are typically as good as the spouses make em, when two people join together with the desire to place value on the marriage & work together as a team usually the marriage is strong, this is why so many marriages fail, when their is no team work and respect for the marriage it is more likely to never succeed. For some reason or  you have a husband who is not united with you,  he simply doesn't appear to be connected to the marriage and appears to have little or no concern with keeping you happy, however this does not mean that he doesn't love you, but it sure looks as though he has taken advantage of the marriage to the point where he feels as if he needs to not participate in making things work and keeping you his wife a happy woman, and keeping a spouse happy is so critical to keeping a marriage strong and successful, after all not many happy couples cheat, so maybe you should speak to your husband about the importance of keeping each other happy, as happiness is the key to longevity in a marriage. Good Luck Penelope|`|goY0JHzlaa	You are letting him. You may not realize it. But, put your foot down and tell him this crap has to stop and you are not putting up with it anymore. Try talking it out with him. Be the ice breaker. If that doesn't work, then suggest counseling for the both of your. If that doesn't work, then, you need to consider where you are going to be 5 years from now. Miserable and Married?|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I'm thinking that God would not be advising you to yell and scream at each other.  You are going to need to do more than pray...praying isn't an action that will bring results.  You and your husband need therapy.  Get it.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	Just stop yelling & screaming.  Don't answer him.  Go about your life and see what happens.|`|ejHQstBeaa	Try counseling, before it gets to be too late.|`|RtkB46peaa	Are you joking?  If you're wondering why your marriage is failing, allow me to suggest a few things for you to think about:<br>  <br>  1.  If you're tired of yelling and screaming, try this:  don't yell and scream.  You're a mature woman, and can control your emotions better than this.  If you stop yelling, maybe your husband (aka, the jerk) will stop, too.<br>  <br>  2.  If you use prayer as a way to fix your marriage, you have a LOT of waiting to do.  You see, prayer may make you feel better about your situation (it's calming, it's a good outlet, etc), but it isn't going to do anything to CHANGE the situation.  See you have to actually change your OWN behavior, and he has to do the same.  Using prayer to fix things like this just sets you up for disappointment and gives you further justification for your siutation.  "I did everything I could do.  I prayed, and God didn't fix it, so maybe it isn't meant to be"  BULL.  Take responsibility for the situation yourself, and act.  Do you honestly think that God is going to step in and intervene by changing your or your husband's attitudes or personalities?  That's silly.  We would have absolutely no free will if God stepped in to intervene everytime we prayed to Him.<br>  <br>  3.  Today is your anniversary.  Did you get him a nice gift to remind him how much he means to you?  This is a two way street, and if he's not going to budge, it sounds like you are going to have to be the inititator.  Who else is going to fix this but you?  Oh, and if you do get him a nice gift, a sure fire way of having it blow up in your face is to get upset when you don't get one in return.  Give him a gift because you want to, not because you expect on in return. This will motivate him to do something on his own, next time, instead of putting him on the defense when you call him a "jerk" for being inconsiderate.<br>  <br>  4.  We men don't think we can treat women as foot stools.  A select few jerks may have such attitudes, but most men are not this way.  Most men yearn for acceptance and respect from their wives.  We live to make our wives happy.  Nothing cuts me worse than seeing my wife in pain, whether it be physical or emotional pain.  Your husband would likely feel and show similar attitudes if he felt repected and appreciated, first.  It's total bunk that women most often have to take the first step in fixing these issues, but let's face it, women have the real power in most every relationship.  Sadly, that's just the way it is.

AA11572031	First off, you have tell him that he needs to quit for the sake of you and<br>  and your children. If he knows but he has not quit then you really do need to get out of there. You said he is a jerk and has put the children in bad situations. So, you know he is not going to stop any time soon.<br>  <br>  For your sake and especially for the children you do need to get on with it and soon. You need to make things right for all of you. He is supposed to be a man and take care of you all. He isn't, you have to before the children think that it is normal to be drunk and uncaring.|`|EGU2MHSPaa	I am divorced with a 6 year old daughter.  I have been divorced for 2 years but my reason was different.  My husband hit on other women a lot while he was working.  He could be a jerk sometimes but I just didn't want that around my child so I moved on.  He also swore at me a lot and got real defensive on certain things so I knew what was going on.  <br>  <br>  I knew it was the right thing because I wanted to make sure I did my best to bring up my daughter properly and in the best possible way.  So since your situation is worse than what mine was, I think you should use your best judgment.  Do you want to be in a world of trouble with money after the divorce or do you think the divorce is the best solution possible?|`|GegQJNzSaa	lol,I stayed with a drug addicted alcoholic for 20 years.

He worked in the day and I worked in the night. When all the kids were in school,I slept. When they got older I slept after they came home from school.

XEJD4mLWaa	Yeah he might have said that but lads tend not to speak their mind. Like if a girl i liked asked me if I was ok when I was upset with her I would still tell her I was fine. (I do that just to see if they did care about me, like to get her attention)<br>  <br>  Perhaps he likes you but doesn't want to admit it yet because if it all goes wrong, he may deeply regret it. Like if he really did have to move away it would be worse if you were in a relationship with him than if you were just friends.<br>  <br>  What he's doing sounds to me like he does like you but just doesn't want to get hurt.<br>  <br>  Well that's what I think...|`|HH7mqS4Qaa	hmmmmm!<br>  i know what you're going through..<br>  i know it really sucks; tell him how you feel.<br>  && be like i need to know how you feel  because i dont want to think you like  me when you dont.<br>  it works!<br>  trust me.|`|AbQCkNHuaa	He might of changed his mind about only liking you as a friend. Or maybe he just doesn't want to lose you as a friend. Or he is just messing with your mind. Or he just started liking those things.<br>  <br>  Quite frankly you can't be too sure about this question from people on here. We do not know this boy personally, and all those answers depend on the guy. So use those answers above that I gave you, and choose by how you know him.<br>  <br>  I really hope this helped.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	4 months is a long enough period of time for his feelings for you to have changed.  I say either he does like you now, or he is using the fact that you like him to try and get some action from you.|`|EXK0kU7Paa	I think he may like you but he doesn't want a full commitment relationship. He is going pretty far from what it sounds like to make you like him.<br>  He surely has to like you if he has gone through that much trouble.<br>  He might not want to admit it but deep down I think he does.<br>  <br>  Sounds like a nice fellow, hold on to him :)

aIqGk60Faa	I say good on you for at least talking to them in the first place especially considering the age gap. But i don't think they were that interested. But if they were i bet they would try to contact you or talk to you if they saw you again. So go back there and maybe they'll see you again. It can't hurt i guess.|`|Ew6kXVWFaa	I read somewhere that men often confuse a woman being friendly and when they fancy them.<br>  I reckon it's pretty hard to talk to a girl in that environment and you did well.<br>  I 'd say they are interested,they know your friend and that gives them confidence in who his friends are.<br>  Age is not an issue, if you think is is, just lie,women do it all the time, it's tradition!|`|bchYTDqjaa	Naw not interseted. They just wanted to have fun.|`|onrcmQf8aa	They wanted you to chase them, and flirt with them alnight.

mqV9TOv0aa	The heart wants what the heart wants... you have a stalker, and you must decide how far you are willing to let the relationship go... From the experience I have shared with listening to many battered Women, A stalker is what you make of it!<br>  <br>  ME!<br>  <br>  .|`|jpTl3o5naa	This is a very sick and desperate man. I am sorry that you slept with him, as he will use this as an excuse. Having sex with him only made matters worse. You will most likely have trouble getting rid of him. His strange behavior is very strange and a means to gain your trust. This man may be dangerous. I would get a restraining order out on him. I hope you know his name and where or approximately where he lives. Watch your back and don't go to the bars for him to find you. He is a needy man and doing things that seem strange only shows that he is "in love" with you but he isn't. I wouldn't want to cross this man, as he may  be capable of anything. He seems to be the type that can't take "no" for an answer and I'd be afraid of that. Don't trust him near you, please.|`|VXiMtwIsaa	He's a stlaker! lol But 4 real he sounds like a stalker!|`|Ih5sGcb4aa	He's a stalker. make it clear to him that you want nothing to do with him. I think the having sex with him idea was definitely a bad one...but whats done cannot be undone.<br>  <br>  Make it clear to him you don't want him...and if he doesn't leave you alone warn him then inform the police...no one should make you feel uncomfortable!
RkimYgEtaa	Yes, give him space but make sure he knows you still have feelings for him. If you both had feelings for eachother then you should have at least attempted to make that into something, if you could count on eachother and trust eachother as friends before then why couldn't you make a relationship stronger? Oh well. Anyway, since he has a girlfriend just let him know what you feel about him but under any circumstances, do not tell him to dump his girlfriend. If he knows how much you like him already and still won't dump his girl, then he doesn't really care that much. Just have a talk with him.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions about this or anything else, contact me at;<br>  curleynicole@ymail.com<br>  <br>  Much love.|`|8i7mg2VQaa	read my question and see if it helps                                                   Im love struck, a romantic love problem?|`|E6bB1bJMaa	yes...SPACE! trust your gut, listen to you, not other people....good luck   ;)<br>  <br>  -Katerbug!-
AI2VoFP4aa	ppl say that because men that are deployed have more opportunity and probably better circumstances to cheat and not get caught. that doesn't mean they all do or all will. ive been in both circumstances ive been cheated on by a guy in the marines years ago and ive been with my husband, a coast guard for two years and hes completely faithful, although if he were over seas i would wonder it doesn't mean he would cheat. it always depends on the guy but any man can and will cheat if he wants to.|`|d8yrvK4waa	Not all are<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|TAyRhPwSaa	I completely disagree...<br>  My fiance is in the military and he is in no way a cheater.  Everyone person is different and everyone is capable of making there own choices.  Whether someone is in the military or works at mc donalds-they make the decision to cheat...Military has nothing to do with it.<br>  xoxo|`|6a264538576a4c21cd1d23b20ef80f14aa	All men are separate.  Their profession has nothing to do with it.  At some bases there are a lot of girls that hang around looking for a one-night stand or something.  The girls who don't make it on base, usually stay at a gas station or something near the front gates.  I've witnessed this.  You just need to trust your man and let him trust you. Everything will work out as long as you trust.  Men in the military just need support and love, and they'll be faithful|`|XEcoJnt4aa	All men are individuals and make their own choices. Some are, some aren't.Have a nice day!|`|kgIccwR0aa	not all men are the same
vwZvxNevaa	Just go up to him. Say hey me and a few friends are going to the movies this weekend so you wanna come were going to see...whatever movie it is you're seeing. If you have his number then text and ask. If he says nah then just say ok well it's cool I just wanted to give you the invite. I can't really tell u what he will say cause I don't know him but just don't be so nervous. Be zen...another word for cool and relaxed and uncaring. introduce him to your other friends and tell them about like he works at the fire station and doesn't really have a lot of time to hang so you invited him out with ya'll. Any random conversation starter after that will work to break the ice. Considering it is the movies bring him up to the snack stand. He is a guy and will want to eat. Good luck.|`|qO5woDAgaa	first fo all you take him with you theres a chance he'll spend the times with your mates rather then you, you gotta learn when i make a move one a girl single rider she gives her number if im loaded with 4 boys in the car she goes of so you lot need to go alone man common sence gues u neva had a bf|`|nXZUOJ20aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Phone him up and ask him to go to the cinema's, things are allot easier to say over the phone, also when you are at the cinemas with him introduce him to all your mates and then he'll feel more comfortable, also include him in light conversation.<br>  <br>  Thanks x|`|lywRBk4Kaa	Tell your friends you'd rather just go with him by yourself.  Walk up to him and say, "I'm going to the movies this weekend, I'd hate to go by myself and have no one to keep me company...why don't you come with me?"|`|80V7RxwQaa	get one of your friends that know him better to ask him and he will probably say yes.
oHN6jwjoaa	our emotions are wild. you have to understand that.<br>  but at the same time, its kinda dumb. i hate when people do this.<br>  <br>  there could be a possibility that she is playing hard to get or that she doesnt think you are interested in her.<br>  <br>  i've been down this road a few times and this stuff never really gets explained. guys do this too though. remember that.|`|EdidZdtlaa	it could be alot of  things. maybe its something you said but try and find out from that girl what happened. maybe its that time of the month. you never know but find out whats wrong with her|`|JAKKanVUaa	if a girl tells a guy something like that she would be expecting a response from the guy that would be the same in feelings. so if the guy didn't responded with the same type of feelings then the guy probably made the girl feel like the guy didn't feel the same way, so then the girl would become distant because she would be thinking that the feelings weren't the same.|`|zr5WwMwVaa	ok it depends on the girl like for example <br>  <br>  if a girl meets a dude that she REALLY likes then she is bound to say all those things<br>  <br>  and if a girl meets a guy tha gives her attention on the day that they meet then she will say those things untill the guy is rude<br>  <br>  but sometimes a girl just wants a romantic relationship so she might say to a lot of guys and the one that says stuff back then thats the one that she will be interested in|`|Q9sjbSkqaa	its seems she never really liked u girls get bored easily and move on so fast wen they dont really care if she were a a true woman she would admitt her faults and appologize for they was she treated u|`|mK0cakU9aa	Yea it happened to me too man, I dont get it either.|`|uLHtXibRaa	I dont know but ive never done this..so i dont know...you would have to ask the girl in question..|`|LcOPL8gCaa	Either its something you said or she is pmsing.

Are you seeing someone else? or is she?<br>  <br>  I'll pray for you. Good luck & best wishes|`|TiOsIfi7aa	hahah becuse we are mysterious. well, it all depends on how we feel.  sometimes we do really think about our guys at random times, but when they try to piss us off thats when we randomly decide to distant or leave them quickly :)|`|sXU3RrfWaa	Because we're waiting for the guy to turn into a typical, flaky, indecisive male.<br>  <br>  We're allowed to change our minds JUST like ya'll are.|`|VXiMtwIsaa	i never really thought about it.|`|ANpzT9HJaa	it could be that something has come up , but in most cases i've seen , the girl is tryin to play you so just look out|`|UIhbJjQFaa	because we don't know what we want and we are prats sometimes|`|gMYoi210aa	some chicks DONT know what they want, they dont appreciate a good guy|`|yBTTPsbNaa	A lot could be going on in her head. She could be stressed with her responsibilities or maybe she felt that you didn't the same or she didn't want to look too clingy. There are a numerous reasons why this happens. I would just be patient and if she is still despondent then i would mention something.|`|aLajoXnRaa	there most be a problem..<br>  either fading love or likeness..<br>  something happened...<br>  any promblems lately..??<br>  someone else maybe..<br>  really hope there isnt...but yeah u never know..<br>  mood swings..<br>  They may still like you an all, but need time..either cz something happened or jst cz they simply need time.|`|z85bqbY4aa	well.. some girls get really excited.. den find out da guys boring :p lol nah its because the guys dont exactly respond in the same way..<br>   but guys do it to...you meet some one really happy,excited and then they fade out|`|lVIdENvqaa	That's how a woman's mind works.

ruS47Twmaa	don't say anything. He obviously cared about you enough that he didn't want you to think he was a weirdo from the get-go.<br>  <br>  Forgive him and forget about it.|`|AA10928214	Wow, yeah that is really weird that someone would lie about having other relationships when they didn't... maybe he is just embarassed and feels comfortable enough with you, and really likes you, so he needs to tell you the truth before it is "too late" and it has gone too far. How long have you been with him? I guess it's up to you, if you really care for him, then stay with him, but make sure he knows that he needs to start with a clean slate and get all the lies out on the table.|`|4nWv0NRuaa	would u rather he had slept with 200 women and be a carrier of 1001 STDs?<br>  listen, maybe he's just really shy.<br>  there are different lies. lies to be malicious and lies to protect oneself. i think he was just embarrassed. which i think should not be an embarassment to be a virgin. i think id be more embarassed if i slept around and had herpes and other disease.|`|2LTumLwNaa	How old did he say he was before he told you he was 24? If the lies were detailed, then I would leave him. How can you trust him? Something like that happened to me except much more severe, and after 9 months, I was rushed to a hospital. And not to be mean, but there must be something wrong or something with him if he's never had anyone...|`|edCUawppaa	I would tell him to kick rocks. If he has lied to you about something as important as that he will like to you many more times.|`|3LlW0uf5aa	I think he knew that you would react weird to this. So he told you pretty much what you wanted  to hear. no one at 24 years of age would like to tell anyone that they are a virgin. Just tell him that its okay, and you forgive him. and get on in the relationship. If hes willing to give up his virginity to you, you must mean quite a lot to him. Best of luck to you|`|aQNtoCYsaa	How lucky are you? <br>  If I was 24 and met someone like this I'd stick with him. In the 70's a virgin of 15 was hard to find let alone one of 24. Men always lie about the women they have been with. It's the ego thing and their egos are...well, big and vulnerable.<br>  Good luck with the relationship.|`|Px990WYDaa	holy crap..<br>  <br>  thats crazy, he probably said all that stuff to get with you , then realized he had real feelings for you and is now coming out... uhhh.. im not sure how you felt about him or if he really is creepy... hmmmm.. wierd. maybe you should ask him why he lied- if you cared or leave the loser if you dont have any feelings for him. its up to you if you want to be with this guy or not..|`|6AzWUY8Gaa	I'd rather have a guy lie to me about being a virgin than him being a player. Atleast he had the guts to tell the truth, give him a chance. <br>  <br>  You should be happy that you are the first one...........<br>  lol|`|AN3aE1Scaa	This is a hard question. He obviously didn't want to lie to you, but he was embarrassed about being a virgin. Least now he has come out and told you the truth. <br>  <br>  Just think, it could have been something worse...|`|l7tijAohaa	Give him some credit for being honest, It must have been difficult to come to you and tell you. He obviously wants a future with you and wants to make things right. Good Luck.|`|KFgrvcSYaa	He prolly was trying to sound experienced, when in fact<br>  he was embarrassed of his "pinky" di ck!|`|EteRTWkfaa	Tell him exactly how you feel about all this!! GOOD LUCK!|`|jN1gsgRAaa	Well judging by your reaction i can see why he probably lied. He probably was embarassed about being a virgin and never being in a relationship especially when your 24 yrs old. So i say that you should ask him why he lied to find out the true answer. But overall I def think you should forgive and forget...obviously he felt bad about lying and wanted to tell you the truth. Besides wouldn't you rather to have a guy whose a virgin than a player whose been with tons of girls...idk...but if you can't forgive him then move on...|`|eTOY5My6aa	its his past. get over it. forgive him but dont forget because now how do you know he wont lie again.|`|AA10378030	Maybe he was afraid to tell you and get the reaction you have now. He was probably embarassed to tell you...poor guy....|`|d6959f140445530c8d381f41dd69fcecaa	What do you say????  Ho about, "bye"
AA10757358	Your son is a grown man but he is living in your house.  You have every right to confront him and if you don't want marijuana in your home, tell him that and let him know that you are disappointed in him.<br>  Tell him that you are so afraid of it and what it can led to that either the marijuana has to go or he does.  Let him know you love him to much to see him get involved in marijuana and the people that use if and sell it. I hope he makes the right decision.|`|JOuomnisaa	Your son is an adult and has made the adult decision to break the law and bring an illegal substance into your home.  You could go to him and say "It's great that you have decided to make adult decisions.  Congratulations on taking charge or your life!  Now that you have decided that you will live life on your terms, I am eager to help you get started.  Here's the newspaper; I'm sure you can find an apartment.  I have plans for your room, so please be moved within the next two weeks.  I'd be happy to go shopping with you to help you with some of the staples like paper towels and toilet paper.  And if you need decorating advice, I'm available!"<br>  <br>  And then you can either stick to it, or, after he gets good and scared, give him a second--but LAST--chance to live by your rules until he moves out.|`|AA11313793	Your son in a grown man who can do what he wants.  However, he is living in your home.  That being said, you be honest and tell him that you found it and that you disapprove.  Be an adult about it and talk to him on his level and not like he is a young child.|`|yCUOXInFaa	Tell him in no uncertain terms will you allow him to bring drugs into the house....period!<br>  Tell him your dissappointed that he is using the stuff and you wish he didn't. He is 22 years old and there is not alot you can do to stop him, unfortunately!|`|MPfj42xDaa	If you do decide to speak with him about it, do it in a comely matter. He is a grown man.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Firstly, what are you doing in his room at all?<br>  He is 22, an adult, shouldn't be living at home in the first place. But he does live at home, you still need to treat him like an adult, and that includes letting him live his own life, not going in his room and giving him privacy. There is no reason to get all judgy on this, it's only weed, it's hardly going to 'ruin his life' which is what you are probably freaking out about.
ephBKMthaa	I feel badly for you, it's hard to begin to see someone for who they really are, even when you care for them.  You said he was cute, sweet, a good kisser and could read you like a book and that he was perfect.  I don't see where you say you loved him or that he loved you.  Interesting omission it seems, especially after 5 years.  <br>  <br>  If you hadn't seen his indiscretion with your own eyes, would you have believed that he was a cheater?  Does it make you wonder how many other times he may have not told you the truth and cheated?  He's only asking you to marry him, so he can keep you to himself, but the question to me is - would you have him to yourself.  I don't think so, once a cheater . . . always a cheater.  You deserve someone who is honest and loves you enough to be faithful, regardless of the situation.<br>  <br>  Short Answer - NO don't marry him, unless of course you want to spend your life being lied to and manipulated (since he can ready you like a book).<br>  <br>  If he was truly perfect for you, he would not have cheated.  Good Luck on your choice, whatever it may be.|`|AA11958911	ya trust him|`|AA11143998	I think it's time to take a step back and think, do I really trust him now? He may be asking you this because he feels guilty. I always said once a cheat always a cheat. But one thing is for sure, you should not marry him until you have trust. If you don't have trust you are going to be very miserable in the relationship, you will always be wondering if he is doing what he says he is doing or going where he says he is going. I think you are in for a lot of heartache if you marry him now.|`|UOIcXs7Haa	Do you honestly think if he cheated on you he wont do it again if you marry him?|`|FLPRFTccaa	yes. hope this helped.|`|NrY7zZlnaa	ok i think you should trust him even though i am 15 and dont understand i do understand what guys are like we need open space but i really think u should trust|`|BfmV2KpUaa	Run, run, very far away. <br>  He may be cute, but he also lies and cheats behind your back. He only pulled out a ring and proposed to you because he knew he'd been caught, which immediately diverted attention away from the fact that he's treated you like crap. Do not fall for it ! It's guys like him that give other guys a bad name. <br>  You'll be making the biggest mistake of your life, that's if he goes through with it, which I actually highly doubt, owing to what prompted his proposal in the first place. <br>  You say he can read you like a book. That to me indicates that he thinks he knows how to manipulate you as well, which is exactly what he is trying to do. I am sorry for you, but you can do a lot better than him.|`|LALfPKmSaa	No. What's to stop him from cheating on you again?? Any woman with any self respect would have dumped him right away.<br>  Besides you're not old enough to get married from the sound of your question. Dump him and concentrate on school, and becoming independent and not needing to lean on a guy.|`|6kbgcOYAaa	Don't marry someone who feels like they have to ask you to marry them to make up for doing something horrible. He needs to prove to you that he won't do it again before you even think about marrying him.<br>  You have no reason to trust him right now.|`|Ih5sGcb4aa	No! At least not now....he has to earn back your trust before he can even dream of you marrying him...Girl you deserve respect! How could he???|`|6e6635b3b350de6d62bf6e8a614cf3c2aa	NO. U will regret!  Why i say so, he cheat on u once there will be the 2nd times. trust me.

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	if it were me i would end it, because for one he is married, he doesn't belong to u, and its something that could harm u emotionally. it will harm his family, maybe cause a divorce. and if they will cheat on their wife, they will cheat on u too. your buying yourself pain that u don't have to have. and do u really think that god would allow u to be happy if u hurt someone else. when my ex left me for the other woman, i was devastated, and it didn't''t turn out for them either. they did not find happiness. found out they had some severe problems. if it were me i would end it, and find someone who was free to give me what i needed and wanted. why take the risk that it could be your heart that gets broken? sometimes its the wife who wins out, and sometimes its the mistress, but it doesn't guarantee happiness even if he does leave her. eventually u are going to want more from him, u are not going to want to share him,and this is when all of the problems come. eventually u are going to expect him to choose between u and his wife. and u have no idea what this does to someones life.|`|PRjvY6Vgaa	If it were me, I would do nothing, because considering the fact that he is married, how can you really be truly in love with him? Ponder on that as hard as you can, ok?|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	well that is not going to happen for me .. but if i was in your shoes forget it . You would be labeled a home wrecker. Some people get really violent against people who mess with there spouse.  Also  most of the time if you cheat with some one who is married. They will in turn cheat on you if you two get serious . cheating around with a married person is never the answer.  When there so many sexy singles out there to pick from why not just get with one of them.  messing with married people can  cause big problems.. besides if you were married would you want some one sleeping with your spouse your in love with?   It just point out a person's low morals when they mess around with a married person.|`|EJWphb88aa	Stop myself... coz married people only seek for comfort outside not love and i am not a **** to be used for a convenience of the man who cheats on his wife|`|ND1nFEWSaa	pleas do not do anything, any action will definitely lead to trouble|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	ask God to free me from this feeling
DZCFD0p2aa	use them as cleaning cloths.|`|zBwyfE92aa	Hmm, try a Vintage store.. or a Thrift Store. I am sure they would take them. Get online and call places in big cities like Los Angeles. The thrift stores out there definitely takes them.  Of course, try your local Thrift Shops first.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://Whitepages.com" rel="nofollow">http://Whitepages.com</a><br>  and type in Thrift Stores in Los Angeles.<br>  Good Luck.|`|NARQ5owBaa	e-bay, freecycle, craigslist... there are lots of ways you could get rid of them.|`|5vgnrvcmaa	RECYCLE  -  do not throw them away<br>  <br>  especially if people without bathing suits could use one.<br>  <br>  Drop them off at one of those drop boxes for clothes donations or a church.
rXBhCKkeaa	first of all the text that was really sweet!!! She sounds like she wants to put herself out there more, and she has chosen to do that with you. She does seem to like you, just don't be to pushy she is nervous and she doesn't seem like the type of girl to come out and say she likes you first. Just try and take small steps. Start with the hugs and work your way up. Once you feel brave enough when you are saying goodbye for the night hug her and kiss her forehead. Its a sweet and subtle way to show her your willing to take things further. ;)|`|2vgbJhlRaa	sounds like shes interested! Ask her out man, but keep in mind that first dates are usually very casual like coffee or something, keep the movie dates and dinner dates till later! but it sounds like your on to something there. i really do hope the best for you! :D oh and dont text her asking her out, call her or do it in person! it shows you have confidence in yourself and arent afraid to go after what you want!
dGM6JGqdaa	I think you should go find you a man so he can show you what a man is all about so you can get rid of those lesbian feelings, and enjoy life for a change !<br>  <br>  Doesn't sound like your happy being a lesbian !|`|d9tCS7BPaa	Try flirting with her on MSN to spark things up a bit. The goal is to rekindle her interest in you....but don't come off as too eager. After talking to her a few more times and flirting.... THEN casually try to make plans again to meet up if she hasn't already. See how that goes. Good luck.|`|q8lGCozzaa	hi you can try this one:<br>  dating-tips4you.blogspot.com<br>  it really worked for me|`|lP04jzv6aa	I think you two are okay. Time will heal the hurt feelings. just be you and see where it goes. It sounds like you both had valid reasons to cancel on one another.|`|15it6Zyqaa	go get a guy and get some life|`|hx7NWXq2aa	I would think that she does like you going on what you said. I wouldn't think she's still pissed at you for cancelling that time coz she's back talking in full swing. I'd say you're running out of things to say coz you're thinking about things to say and you're not feeling fully comfortable coz you feel bad for cancelling. So what I would do is make a joke about you both having to cancel and invite her out again. And I know credit for phones is hard sometimes to get but maybe chatting on the phone will help coz sometimes MSN isn't a great way to go for a conversation. Don't forget to be confident you have nothing to lose (i.e. if you wanted to ask her out). I don't think it's you at all. Oh and don't forget you never know what's going on in her life so maybe she's distracted coz she's stressing about someting else entirely.|`|Bm3jwCjMaa	Best thing you can do, is just give it one more shot, timing is not always right!... It is tough to get the timing right, but once you do its worth it... So just give her another shot, if she bails on you again.. maybe its just not meant to be, and you could just move on.|`|xF88Jm3waa	I suggest you a train a dog to walk on two legs and then teach it to wield a Sledgehammer. <br>  <br>  Teach it basic concepts of morality and set it loose on the city to trump evildoers.

And im getting to the point where i'm actually having to tell myself no! becuz it's getting to be all the relationship is about. We have a powerful emotional connection but both of us are very physical and it sounds like you guys are too. He probably really appreciates everything, your both young and this is a fun way of experimenting. I mean I know there are so many ideas and stuff you could come up with and it's all very exciting and the attraction you have for him will obviously put these ideas in your head as their so powerful. My advice is that while these thoughts are in your head - why don't you arrange a day out somewhere with your boyfriend instead. Avoid at all costs the whole staying over, gettin a hotel room scenario - you could have a nice dinner or something, go to the cinema - go out in public generally more often. You will probably appreciate your time in the bedroom more once you've had a few general dates as you would have missed it so much. Good luck!|`|i4bjQbPcaa	It's the honeymoon period and it wears off eventually.  At the moment you are both young and fit and fancy each other rotten.  You don't have worries like kids etc so you have time to actually enjoy some alone time together.  <br>  <br>  Cherish it, plus it keeps you very fit|`|6o6Ao1Paaa	Sex is a good thing if you are in a right way and you are but you must control yourself and concentrate on your work and family too|`|wKCgaoZVaa	Your in that "honeymoon period" where its all about lust.

sEryEzoyaa	it is perfectly normal i think! this is exactly wat happened to me last summer! on my summer vacation i met these two great guys and they were like amazing and i thought about him like all the time and when it was time to eat i just wasn't hungry at all and i barely ate anything that week! i just plain didn't feel hungry! my friends ate a lot and i just sat there and daydreamed lol so yup that is normal and good luck with him!|`|ZZbbFCIFaa	Yes i was really into this  girl and i didn't feel hungry. I really hated that feeling and obviously it was really strong because 8 months later i still think about her all the time.|`|t4bCkAekaa	Could be you're falling in love.... but, believe me if you force yourself to slow it down, enjoy the feelings and take things at a reasonable pace... it will last longer and in the end be a stronger bond.  This feels really amazing and can be a little scary, but just enjoy it while you're in it.

I would have a long discussion with him, and if it doesn't stop, you might want to move on and stop wasting your time.|`|zx0IQ1Fsaa	its just a natural reaction<br>  dnt worry too much <br>  tell him how u feel about it
jVUEohsNaa	Only if you get caught...|`|VZVGXRyraa	I think it's pretty wrong...even if you 2 aren't having sex. Why would he want a 14 year old when he's 22? That seems a little off to me.

What do they have to say about your relationship?|`|NXJDsVfNaa	Normally, I say age is just a number...<br>  but a 22 year old has NO BUSINESS dating a 14 year old. <br>  Its EXTREMELY illegal and frankly, stupid on your part. <br>  Guys that old generally have experience ((you know)) and is probably just after that one thing. Do yourself a favor and DON'T give it to him. <br>  If you are smart, then you should break up with him.

He is much too old for you and he knows it. He knows it's illegal, too, and he knows WHY it's illegal. He's older and way more experienced than you are. Older guys can talk younger girls into doing things that they aren't ready to do; they are really good at convincing girls that they have feelings they don't, and you can and most likely will end up getting really hurt. I know you want to believe that he's great, but please think about what I'm saying. No grown man should want to date a 14 year old girl! <br>  <br>  If he really had any love or respect for you, he would wait until you turn eighteen. What he's doing is illegal for a very good reason!|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	It's not only wrong but it is illegal and it won't last.  There is something wrong with this guy that he can't find a woman is own age and he is only with you for one thing. You should end it with him now and find a boy your own age.|`|8QEtcKhnaa	Terrible, it is not a great relationship you are way too young to understand the meaning of a great relationship.

AA10952386	I don't think you have to get him anything. If he's giving it to you after V-Day, he might have just realized he should have bought you something and felt it was a nice thing to do. <br>  If you are going to get him something, just get him a card. You say you're NOT boyfriend and girlfriend, so to go all out and spend money on him is not neccessary and V-Day is way past. <br>  Find out what this "gift" means - if he's initiating something with you because he wants to go out with you again or if he's just being nice. If you two are friends, try to find out if he got any stuffed animals for his other female friends. make sure you know you are the only one he is being nice to before you have faith in his actions.|`|o0fjzrDhaa	give him a big longgggggggg kiss.and tell him that you like him! that will be the best gift for him!!

NO, she doesn't. Not at all.<br>  <br>  Every girl is different. Some MAY only care about looks. Some don't care if you look deformed - they'll say it's all about the personality. As for this rif-raf of colored hair... this is ridiculous. It is called PERSONAL preference. She obviously doesn't seem to care about much important and I guess her baby daddy may be hot, but wasn't A game in the personality department.

Sounds like you need more mature friends if the ones you have are telling you that making him jealous is a good way to get him back. This is not 7th grade. It's life as an adult with a real, adult problem. If you want him back you need to do it the way an adult would. Go and talk to him.

Missing him is not necessarily a good reason to get back together and trying to make him jealous may actually backfire and make him feel more inclined not to get back together.|`|YdjX5fOWaa	It's a bad idea.  You should want your husband to be with you because he misses you and loves you, not because he's jealous.  That's not going to bring him home for the right reasons and it's juvenile.|`|EZ5mwUF3aa	You're right it is very juvenile and can backfire in a bad way.

Don't count on tapping a guy's ego by making him jealous, this is not a proof of love, its an ego issue.   I learned that with my ex who never loved me and was being unfaithful to me.   We were separated, like you, and I went to the club I knew he was at and started to dance with this guy and my ex came up to him and the bouncers had to remove him from the club.   Result, he was still the same jerk who did not love me, what made him jump was his ego, not his love.   Be smart and move on.|`|dPk7dr7laa	Don't try to make him jealous. Watch the movie Fire Proof. Seriously do it. It has some super great ways to tell him how much he means ot you and making him jealous is not one of them. i have to say that is the best movie i have ever seen. My husband feels the same way. A tad cheesey at the five minutes but watch it to the end. Making him jealous will only feul the fire that you are trying to put out.

mpGjPV6Xaa	First, you 2 would start off with foreplay, which is kissing, touching, caressing eachothers bodies,etc... then you or him would begin undressing while still kissing or touching. After you 2 are both naked, you would then start to have sex, it can be however you 2 decide to do it. He can be on top of you or you can be on top of him. However you guys choose to do it, it's still sex. If you're on top, you will begin to ride as if you were on a horse ( lol ) just bounce up and down and if you get tired just switch positions. Let him get on top of you known as the " missionary position ", from this point you don't really have to do anything but just lay there and enjoy. You can kiss him or touch him though, that makes it more enjoyable. If you want you 2 can also try " doggy style", which so many girls love. He'll begin to perform from behind you, while you just stay how you are. I mean there's so many ways to have sex, you can also try " 69 " guy on girl or girl on guy in a laying position performing oral sex. It's over when you orgasm or your boyfriend ejaculates. Even though, if you 2 are wanting to have a long day of sex, you can always go again , but  it really ends when one of you cums.<br>  <br>  Hope I help and good luck with your first sexual experience !!<br>  <br>  Joseph D : )|`|YIbELNRBaa	What do you mean?

If he gets turned on without you touching him, he sounds pretty excitable.  So, you might try touching his crotch... just rubbing him lightly.  Touching him anywhere will excite him.<br>  You can also try anything oral.  He will love it.  You are both young and inexperenced, so you can try anything you want and see what you both like and see what works.  <br>  Experiment a little... let him know what you like or what you want him to do.

Most people are not skanks. <br>  <br>  Anyways dear:<br>  Well try just kissing on a couch or something soft and nice. But sit on him. wrap your legs around him (yes you will feel a little odd) and make out. Get kinda touchy, and flirt with him, then pull him to a room and take off his shirt. Then run your hands down his tummy and his muscles, he'll get your clue, and he'll prob take off your shirt, and then you'll be kissing and then you both get undressed, have him lay on top of you, its called missionary. Spred your legs wide, your gonna have to because your a virgin. (its not bad its good) It will hurt a little bit, help guide him in to you (use a condom has lub so it will help it go in better) and tell him to be easy, don't push to hard, and just experiment.

9x4fssPuaa	Well you have a very real and valid concern. When we think of starting relationships we have to ask these questions and you are on the right track. Love isn't easy, especially when we want to do the right thing as per our spiritual beliefs. I am Catholic as well I used to have the same thoughts as you did at your age, currently I have been married for 2 yrs and I married a Protestant who's parents are elders in a church. Believe it or not.This was something that was answered to me in prayer & given my years and experience, it was right for me. <br>  <br>  My point is, being "equally yoked" means alot of different things when the time is right and people are always changing even in the smallest ways - don't ever forget that. You may not have these views when it is time for you to marry, what worked for me doesn't mean it will work for all, however be open minded but not so open that your brains fall out.<br>  <br>  You're on the right track, be yourself and don't forget that within the realm of our personal moral rules we never know how things will turn out unless we try, because who you are now will part of the type of woman you will become when you are ready for marriage.  If hanging you're around him long enough for a relationship...it's okay and it will work itself out, your learning process will add up and shape the type of adult you will be, just keep praying about it.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	At 14 and 16 I don't think you have to worry about this yet.  In fact, come time for marriage, I don't think it will be to each other.  <br>  <br>  <br>  As a "big Catholic", you should know that Catholicism is a branch of christianity, and that you and him worship the same principals (Jesus, God and the Holy Spirit).  All Catholics are basically Christians, but we have more detailed rituals and guidelines.  Next time someone tells you that you aren't a "true christian" remember that we too read the bible, and that your form of Christianity is the oldest organized form.|`|AA12325261	No need to worry about it until you actually get to the point of where you're discussing marriage seriously, say in about 5-6 years.<br>  <br>  <br>  Statistics say you'll never need to worry about it.|`|mK0cakU9aa	There isnt that much of a difference.<br>  <br>  My friends Parents one is Jew and the other is Muslim and they got married and had my friend.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	It's not that complicated, those are both Christian religions. It's not like he's a hardline Muslim and you're a zionist Jew!|`|HP0WqWXYaa	Your age is not good enough for this type of judgment. Include your parents to your thoughts.|`|yBTTPsbNaa	Christians and Catholics can be very similar in their beliefs. I understand where you are coming from. I am a Catholic i would not want to marry anywhere else, but in my church. I am sure that if you explain how you feel (when you get more serious) that he will be understanding. <br>  Having a different religion than your partner can be very difficult when finding a happy medium. If he truly loves you he will understand your need to marry in your church. <br>  But as for now i would relax. Marriage shouldn't come for awhile, but just know that you should be able to talk with him about anything including your thoughts, feelings, and where to have the ceremony!<br>  <br>  God Bless and Good Luck!|`|cydakP87aa	its difficult.<br>  sometimes its better just not get started in relationships like this because if neither is willing to convert then it will only end in tears<br>  certainly dont do anything too physical because that really only complicates things<br>  maybe just try it out for a little while and see how things go<br>  but dont let it go too far before you really think about it and what you are willing to do with your religion<br>  religion is a big deal and not something to be taken lightly<br>  so if it is important to you dont let someone pursuade you to give it up<br>  also, talk to the guy about it and see what he thinks and what ideas you guys come up with together|`|AA11227500	Well I wouldn't read to much into at the moment seeing as you are both so young still. Now say you were 26 and he was 24 and you did want to get married then it would be in both of your best interests to speak with a priest or Father about your situation. Marriages happen like this all the time. Christianity and Catholisism are both linked in many ways, I don't see why you wouldn't be able to have both priest marry you and then you take turns attending mass and services.|`|udPtqagzaa	Marriage is about sacrifices; putting the other person before you no matter what. I don't mean to offend your religions- I understand that it means a lot to both of you, but love conquers all. Would either of you consider getting married outside a church? I doubt that's a possibility if you are both serious about your religions, but maybe a compromise could help? Marry abroad, or in the country, or on the beach, and then each visit your churches to declare your love for eachother to your Gods separately.

BSg9J96Oaa	1. Daughter will get the property because it is named in the will.<br>  2. If he has a will, it will go to her, if not, it will still go through probate even though her name is on it too.<br>  3. Daughter, because it's already in her name<br>  4. If the house isn't mentioned in the will, it will go though probate.  If mentioned in the will that all property be signed over to the significant other, then that will happen.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	Most states will not allow you to disinherit your spouse without the spouse signing off on the will.  So if he's left everything to his daughter in the will then the still married wife, now widow can contest the will and get half of everything regardless of what the will says.<br>  <br>  But in general, jointly owned property cannot be given to someone else without consent of both parties so the man can only leave his share of the property to his daughter, not the part that belongs to the wife.<br>  <br>  The business checking is in man's and wife's names.  half of the money after the debts has been paid is hers automatically because her name is on the account.  But as his wife it all becomes hers unless there is a will that says otherwise.  So chances are half is still hers and the other half is the daughter's unless the wife contests the will then 3/4 of the account could be the wife's and 1/4 is the daughter's.  <br>  <br>  As to the vehicles, if they were in the name of the man then he signed them to the daughter before he died then they are hers.  If the wife's name was on the title and she did not give her release then the wife has a claim on the vehicles as well.<br>  <br>  The home:  if it was the marital home then in most states regardless of whose name is on the deed then the home belonged to both of them and it now becomes the wife's.  If the will says the daughter gets it then she and the wife are now co-owners of the house.<br>  <br>  Basically, if you're the wife.  You need a lawyer to contest the will.  And if you're the daughter and his wife is contesting the will, then it's going to be a while before the will is settled one way or the other.  The judge will take into consideration how long they were married and maybe how long they were separated.  <br>  <br>  Also let this be your example of why you need to finish a divorce and not drag your feet.  Because now his wife is a widow with a widow's rights.  If  they had been divorced then she would have no claims.|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	If a duly signed and witnessed Will was in place that should make all your questions clear.|`|ruczpWrGaa	1.  Daughter gets business, wife gets everything already in the checking account.  She is entitled to it first, legally it was her money as well as the fathers.<br>  <br>  2. Vehicles go to daughter unless otherwise noted in the Will<br>  <br>  3.  Find out whose name is on the home and what the will says.  If the mothers name is on the home then its hers.   If the mothers name is not on the house, what does the will say?  If it does not, depending on the state it is the mothers.  Because they were only separated, not divorced.  Generally speaking wife trumps daughter.|`|AA10152451	You really shouldn't argue about this, if you are going to with the daughter. I've seen that tear families apart. Now, I'm not saying you will but just giving a forewarning. Technically since the daughter was left with the property in the Will, and the daughter has the Power of Attorney then she has the property and the ability to disperse the items to whomever, including herself, at her disposal. Hopefully she will have a good heart and do what her Dad would have wanted.|`|SjEH1Lx6aa	Daughter gets vehicles. Daughter gets half of business checking, wife gets other half. Daughter gets property and home, unless the wife's name is on it. If not, it belongs to daughter.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but if he signed the property over to the daughter AND gave her power of attorney, then the wife is pretty much screwed.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	I would say daughter but I'd have a lawyer look over the paper work|`|3ff7fbbf6ec3ee979b59d7290a91816daa	1.

6FYNAfKlaa	9th grade is a rough year. <br>  <br>  The first thing I think you need to do is be more positive. I don't mean that in a rude way and I don't wanna sound corny but a positive attitude helps so much more than you think. <br>  <br>  Anyways, maybe you just need to get out there. Be friendly. Seem confident and positive and other people will notice the change and pay more attention to you. For school, learn to motivate yourself. I'm sure you're a smart kid but you need to tell yourself that and whenever you're feeling lazy, remind yourself why you need good grades (to get into college, make your parents happy etc.)<br>  <br>  If things get really bad though, you should talk to your parents. If you don't wanna talk to them, go see a school counselor to get some help in making your life a little happier :-)<br>  <br>  I really do hope that helped. I can relate to this a lot. My freshman year was awful but I got myself together by 10th grade and am now a straight A student!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Try joining a school club based on your common interests.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	All though highschool I had what I though was a couple of friends (but as I soon found out, I really had no friends, just people I hung out with). My grades weren't the greatest. It be a blue moon if I got a B. <br>  <br>  I never knew what I wanted to do after I graduated highschool. It never dawned on it. I knew I never planned to go to college. Then when I was 16, summer before my junior year. I met a guy from an AOL chatroom. He just came back from the Army, had joined the National Guard and started college. So yea, dating him while I was in highschool was awesome. 11yrs later, I am married to that guy. <br>  <br>  However, even when I met my husband, my junior and senior year I still didn't know what I wanted out of life. It wasn't until 5yrs ago I fell in love with nature photography. Now I can't put my camera down. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about having friends. Just concentrate on your education. Do the best that you can. Alot of people have no idea what they are doing when they graduate highschool. So many people change their majors in college. <br>  <br>  You will find your interest in life, it may happen tomorrow or it may take time. Just live day by day. Open your eyes, as you may miss something.|`|c7c9hK15aa	hey budddy will u b my " FRIEND "|`|81MgVTicaa	I am kinda in the same boat.

Gk00iL6waa	Tell her to grow up and get off your back. If she can't, then she seriously needs to get a therapist to spew her negativity out to, and a man to handle her emotional needs.

Good luck :)|`|kl1wImM1aa	It seems that your mother need more friends. she need someone to listen to her.

I think you should compromise with your mom. Tell her that you find it very annoying that she is only able to point out the negative things and that she should find things that make her happy and positive. I think you should agree to talk to your mom a little more if she would stop flooding you with all the negative things in life. tell her you don't have time to dwell on the bad things and neither does she. now you don't have to tell her everything that's going on in your life but tell her something. she just wants to know the type of person her little girl is growing up to be.  maybe one of the reasons she is negative is because she doesn't have the type of relationship with you that she wanted to have.  you need to calmly talk to your mom about what bothers you in a non confrontational way. just try to let your mom in a little. I would be absolutely heartbroken if my 3 yr old grew up and shut me out of his life. i would be very sad because he is my everything and he's what i live for. remember, your mom is a person just like you, she's just in a different stage in her life, one that you will soon be in, so be nice to her.

YbwDFvEaaa	You could potentially be asexual. It's not that common, but it does happen. What that means is, you're not sexually attracted to members of either sex, but that certainly doesn't mean you can't feel affection towards people as close friends. The fact that there isn't a particular sex that you feel attracted to can also impede your desire for self-gratification, as well.<br>  <br>  It could also be that for some reason you have a revulsion to sex itself, which would be the product of some repressed memory or experience that would turn you off to what most view as an enjoyable activity. This is a much deeper reasoning than I dare dive into, but if you have access to a therapist or psychologist it may be worth asking about.<br>  <br>  In any case, if not having sex isn't some that bothers you, then why worry so much about it? So long as you're happy and healthy, then there's no reason you should "force" yourself into a physical relationship that you're just not comfortable with.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4HoVVCenaa	It is not abnormally.

Even in the bible, if you read and believe it, marriage is presented as a way for those who cannot control their sexual desires to express those desires in the least damaging way.  The best and most honorable people did not have to have sex or relationships other than pleutonic.   I might worry about myself if i were to start feeling this way so maybe it would be a good idea to speak to a marriage or sex counselor or any psychologist.  Good luck and be happy with yourself.

Attraction is human nature, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself and that's why you feel the way you feel after sex.<br>  It also sounds like a hormone problem as well. It might be a good idea to talk it over with a doctor or psychologist. I think age has something to do with this as well...|`|4Q4dZJHpaa	Theres a word for that I think its called asexual or sumtin.dont worry,every1 of us is made different so theres no"normal"way to be.If it doesnt bother you then its fine.could be that you may feel like having sex with sum1when you feel close to them.I feel much more attracted to sum1when im in love|`|72UNDrwkaa	there is no problem with the way you are if your happy, but maybe you should try talking to a counselor because they may be able to help you find out why you feel the way you do xx|`|iwIrQ4ncaa	whoa. this is something that you need to be talking to a professional counselor about. i honestly don't think that you're gonna find the answer you seek on here.|`|8dREUd2xaa	You're so lucky!

If you relax and just be yourself than maybe you could enjoy people without assuming they want to bed you. another point is that you could be suffering from a form of OCD, <br>  <br>  does it matter to you if you are gay, straight or bi-sexual, the answer should be no. <br>  <br>  don't worry be yourself and enjoy life and all it has.|`|OeRzlZPnaa	It's possible that you just haven't met the right person yet. Another possibility is that you might happen to be asexual. Theres a whole group of the human population that just isn't interested in sex and theres nothing wrong with that. If you want to look into it <a href="http://www.asexuality.org/en/" rel="nofollow">http://www.asexuality.org/en/</a> is a forum for the asexual community.

b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	Acceptance is the only thing you can ever do in situations like this or no relationship will ever work out for you. Accept that he will always find other women attractive, just the same way as there will always be other men that you find attractive. It doesn't mean that either of ye will ever do anything about it. i.e. cheat. You need to relax more. He's your boyfriend, you already have him, what more do you want? Unless you learn to relax, this relationship or any other relationship is doomed. Some men may put up with this behaviour for a while, but not forever. You'll drive him away if you keep doing this, not bring him closer to you which is what you want more than anything.|`|4EWCegiRaa	This is what worked for me because I used to get jealous.<br>  <br>  Whenever you feel yourself getting that way (which you obviously know what it feels like), just tell yourself "I'm just being jealous, don't be ridiculous.  Stop it!".  And keep doing it over and over and over again and then eventually, you'll just stop.  It's like training yourself.|`|dBAuX8hwaa	ok its natural for you for you to be jealous and with the whole long distant relationship thing then of course your going to be worrying about what hes doing and who he is with. You cant help the way you feel. You need to have a proper heart to heart talk with him and tell him how you feel about the whole situation. He wont mind. Yes it will be hard opening up to him like but it is something that you have to do. Relationships are built on love and trust. You cant have a relationship without trust. You must trust him right? Otherwise you wouldnt be together as such. Just talk to him and let him know how your feeling. He will understand and most likely has the same feelings as you.|`|ce9d90af4bd252d25ce81377df2eecc6aa	Perhaps what the issue here is, is that you have insecurity problems. Has anything happened to you in your past that made you feel unwanted or rejected. If you don't deal with inner emotional issues then they tend to stem and manifest into certain times of your life..<br>  I think that you need to express your emotions unambiguously to your partner, otherwise the problem will only increase. A good and strong relationship is about honesty and integrity.. which will strengthen your bond with one another.<br>  I hope everything works out between the both of you xx|`|hHndD5SEaa	i suffer from the green eyed monster too and it very nearly cost me my new relationship this friday night!!!! I saw my boyfriend facing in the general direction of two blondes that Id overheard talking about him on my way back from the loo.... of course instead of doing what I should have done - going up and taking him by the hand or something, I got a cob on- made out like it was HIS fault they were admiring him and starting texting a guy friend of mine to annoy my bf!!!!Its crazy! he got pretty annoyed over it though and we had a huge fall out, but thankfully, we had a chat and made up on Saturday.<br>  ive now realised that its human nature for human beings to admire other people - we all do it - but I have to seperate fact from fiction. The fact is that hes with me - because he wants to be and he chooses me over these other females - and that my behaving like a prat will be a surefire way to ensure he does ditch me in favour of a slightly more normal girl that wont be throwing a hissy fit every time he makes eye contact with someone!!!<br>  xx
mefxIQP9aa	This made me el oh el.<br>  <br>  Either he's really lazy, he's older than he admits, or he has some physical problems that he doesn't want you to know about.|`|MDtBuOaMaa	BS  he is just trying to subtly tell you that he doesn't like you...srry|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Dump him and find a more horney dude.|`|9YQVIolwaa	it takes 2 to tango... if anything u can call me anytime ill come over...
2FNfyxVqaa	Honestly, to tell you the truth, YOU ARE NOT THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE BUT ARE JUST HIS SIDE KICK. He obviously is running major game on you and you need to wake up. Guys will tell you anything they think sounds good or what they think you want to hear. So of course he's telling you that he doesn't love her and that the marriage is over and that you are his soulmate...but then ask yourself, why is she still living with him? That BS excuse about he doesn't want to hurt her is such crap. If they were over, he wouldn't be living with her. and the fact that she doesnt' even know about you is a clear sign that he is playing games. <br>  You NEED to wake up and realize that he is a no good dog playing the both of you. As much as you want to believe that he is really in love with you, don't believe it. If he loved you he wouldn't be with her still. He obviously thinks you're gullible which is why he is doing this to you. You're wanting to be with him will leave you to believe that he really loves you and that he is honest with you and that he's not lying. But believe me, you'll see how this situation will never change. And at the end of the day you'll realize and wake up what was clear to see all this time.<br>  PLEASE LEAVE HIM AND FIND SOMEONE SINGLE.
2FNfyxVqaa	As the first answerer said, honesty is key. You should always be honest with yourself. Obviously the circumstances have changed since the first time so I think it's ok to give it another chance. If the relationship didn't work because of personalities or you guys fought a lot or just didnt' click then that would be different. In that case I would have said just leave it along...but under different circumstances such as distance or whatever the case may be then I would say give it a try. <br>  <br>  Why wouldn't you try it? Then you would live with the "What ifs" and sometimes we do get a second chance at things so I say take it and run with the wind (as corny as that sounds lol)|`|EjyD1sXeaa	honesty is mainly the best policy. stringing someone along and wasting their lives is immature and shows insecurity
XfNA9by9aa	I think you should break up with him because if he didn't have plans with that girl... he wouldn't tell you that he likes another girl...<br>  <br>  You deffinitly deserve better.. If he is your boyfriend he should be all yours.. and not to flirt with other girls...<br>  <br>  And.. there are other guys in the world.. You'll sure find someone that will aperecate you :)|`|AA11755944	tell him to choose.|`|FzFSzilmaa	have a 3way relationship then... :D
jrWpHYAPaa	Question: are you really really madly in love with him? and does he feel the same way? if yes, then maybe you can compromise.  Try to understand why he feels like he needs his space. He works all night and then comes home at around 5 or 6 am? and feels dead tired and wants to sleep eh? Perhaps, his works keeps him so busy and exhausted that it be frustrating when he gets 5 textmsgs asking him to do more stuff?<br>  <br>  And maybe you could keep yourself busy so you don't think about him.<br>  <br>  Your bf should also be trying to take you out or do something special with you at least 2 times a month. If not then maybe you should talk to him to work out a compromise.<br>  <br>  Also, does your bf's personality fit his actions? like he says he can't handle doing more stuff because... he doesn't like to promise things when he doesn't know if he can guarantee it? Is he a straight arrow or more impulsive?<br>  <br>  If you are not desperately head over heels in love with him then follow what everbody else said. Dump him. He's not worth the effort or the time.|`|089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa	He's just not that into you.|`|H0vicK8Kaa	You should be worried! when they start with the 'i need space' line - you are one step away from being DUMPED!!.<br>  Not your fault!! You have a right to ask for more time with him BUT if he doesnt wanna put the effort to spend it with you THEN he really doesnt care for you that much... It's the weekend HE can ask you to join him at the club IF he wanted you there - the posting DJ message is NOT for you to show up there -  I think you should move on!!|`|PSGK1zXLaa	What man doesn't want space. It's essential in every relationship. You need time to miss each other. If you remove expectations, then you are preparing yourself everyday to be suprised. Stop expecting him to text you back after you text him, just let it be. Stop waiting for someone to fullfill your day when your completely capable of having a great day on your own. Most guy wants to keep the chase going, keep the excitement of the hunt. Just go about your own business...|`|NXJDsVfNaa	Um.. no<br>  He does not need space. He has enough space. In fact, he has too much. He is a full time cop and a DJ on weekends...hmm<br>  Yea, you need to give him less space or break it off. Obviously you are not a priority if you never see him.
6fa2568b75c06da2670c61858c9441ceaa	Sometimes it slips and you can't help it, get off his back.<br>  <br>  Just because he curses in front of you doesn't mean he lacks respect or likes you any less, so let it go.<br>  <br>  <br>  As far as the God stuff- I'm not even gonna go there.<br>  <br>  Relax.|`|XgkJF43taa	i understand both ways<br>  <br>  Was he directing the cussing towards you?<br>  If not then its not disrespectful towards you, but it is a little rude.<br>  He was frustrated and upset that he lost, but i agree it isn't right to cuss.<br>  <br>  So he is upset at you because he believes it is just a word not like anything big. <br>  <br>  Ask him to tone it down a little, to take his anger out another way <br>   :)
2l7lbcJWaa	I think that's very insensitive and rude of him! I can't believe all the people who answered "its normal". My boyfriend has never done that in front of me, he said he's never done it in front of anyone EVER. Sometimes he can't fall asleep and wants to have sex because he crashes right after we're done, but if I say no then it means no and he might be pissed but he doesn't resort to jackin it right there in front of me! And the fact that you've talked to him about it and he still does it is a pretty bad sign. He will probably do that in other aspects of your relationship too. I don't know if that's what you wanted to hear, but my opinion is yes, you definitely have a right to be upset about this!|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	Tell him to take a sleep aid tablet. If he can't sleep without getting off, he's got a real problem. Yeah, all guys will do it every now and then, but not as a sleep inducing exercise. <br>  <br>  Go buy him some Simply Sleep or some other sleep aid. He sounds a bit obsessive/compulsive.|`|w8QkrUhBaa	his testorerone levels are too low and due you guys always having sex the times that you guys dont his body isnt use to it so his body is going to be looking for some kind of escape. Just think of smoking cigarettes...|`|edpKlRnhaa	ok so yea i'm kinda in the same situation as you i'm 17 and i moved out and live with my bf. he does the same thing..And i got peeved off one night and it just makes them mad..they want what they want..And yea its geets a little sore down there but they think that pain is just a good way to show that you like it.|`|fBXwWUL4aa	I think that he is probably 'jerking off' because you are next to him in bed and that he would prefer that the two of you were sharing the moment but either you weren't into it or he didn't know how to approach you so he took matters into his own hands (so to speak).  Next time it happens why don't you go ahead and jerk him off, it will probably end sooner that way and I'm sure that it will be more satisfying for him and it could hopefully be some fun for you also.|`|pZxeStPpaa	honestly i don't think u shud be upset. Guys tend to a higher sex drive then us women. I got sore down there too. My bf jerks off at night as well, and the reason being is so that i don't get more sore. It use to hurt me before, but now i do not even think of it. Plus sometimes it makes a go to sleep if they can't go to bed. lol i know its a bad habit of them doing it next to us, but at the same time they are lazy! thats y they don't get up and go somewhere else. Whenever my bf is next to me doing that..i kiss him on the cheeks and see him. It makes him feel good. Hope this helped.|`|1xNMtpkxaa	Tell him stop jerking off in my bed you insensitive prick or get the Frick out
60f46466d2dd728810388e09955b9b12aa	you can take inititive and ask the question.he may bit shy or waiting for the right moment.be clear in what you do in your life.all the best.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	If you are having fun why spoil thing by labeling it ? You could end up ruining a good relationship that has the potential to be something more but if you ask about exclusiveness it may be the end.<br>  Think about it.|`|n7BuH75gaa	Just bring it up. Not that you're wasting time or anything.|`|pSKN4Dmvaa	Bring it up!  You have equal shares in this relationship and you have a right to know what is going through his mind on the subject since it involves your life.  Just remember not to seem pushy or accusatory.  Just ask him if he's okay with seeing other people or if he'd rather it were exclusive and maybe tell him how you feel about it after he puts in his part.  Good luck! : )|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	well if you really like this guy, you should bring it up<br>  just say something like we need to talk about our relationship and let him know how to feel and ask if he feels the same or not. if he feels the same then let's get serious!
AA10034000	Why didn't you find out if he liked you or not before he moved away? I would have. Now, he calls you right? Hmmmmm.. Well maybe he is having some kind of seperating anxiety because he was used to having you around everyday while living together and he treasures the friendship you two share (still). I think it is awesome though. He seems like a guy that I want in my life......good luck!|`|2YbOjWwCaa	you know him best, is he shy, is he gay, is he just a great guy that the world needs lots of.<br>  Maybe he loves you as friend, maybe your the big sister he never had, maybe you should ask him ahhhh its 2009 go for it.|`|fmATfubnaa	he must like u if he keeps in contact<br>  <br>  o.O
OFJFLs2Paa	Well she is not playing hard to get and well she is interested she is just confused. I think that she really wants to be with you, but the thing is she is scared that you might hurt her. Now the thing that you need to do is show her that you aren't a player. That is the only way that she will want to be with you. Text her and try and talk to her like a girlfriend would talk to her. Ask about her life and all that become like a friend to her. After you to become kinda friends then talk to her about that one night that you got a little tipsy and say how you don't know what you was thinking and you feel bad. Kinda ask her for advice about that one time to show that you never really meant it. Good Luck and I really hope that you win her heart over! =D

( I am cool with it )<br>  <br>  Be prepared for a break up.<br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Wow...well first, understand that this is something that you should have told him from the very beginning, and whenever you do decide to tell him, you need to begin with an apology for not telling him sooner. It's understandable that you wanted a guy to take you seriously and get to know YOU before he found out that you're a dancer, and you could tell him so. I imagine that, in your line of work, it's hard to find a guy that will look past the fact that you do what you do. <br>  <br>  Just break it to him gently, and be prepared, because I'm pretty sure he's going to be upset. You might want to break it to him at your place...that way if he gets upset and storms off, there won't be an awkward drive home. You'll be in your own surroundings. And tell him that you're really, really sorry you lied to him, maybe throw in that it gets tiresome always being judged for a s!ut or a wh0re, and guys thinking you're easy just because of what you do for a living. <br>  <br>  No one has the right to judge you, but just keep in mind that he's going to probably be more upset that you weren't honest with him at first...and if he thinks he's too good to date a stipper then eff him.|`|NXJDsVfNaa	I am kind of surprised that you haven't already told him. <br>  He definetely needs to know and you might just have to come right out and say it. I mean, is there ever a "right time" for a girl to tell her boyfriend, "I'm a stripper."<br>  Probably not. >.<<br>  Just do it. If he really likes you or loved you, he will understand, although he probably will not support it. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|UoNe20J6aa	he should but expect him to look at you differently.<br>  <br>  confess at www.blabbitall.com<br>  gossip, secrets and confessions revealed|`|dIMa7LdWaa	If hes into you he wont mind.  He might even be proud of it. I would be, long as you dont do anything else on the side.  Youll be fine, but you should probably tell him sooner rather than later.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Sorry but if I were him I would dump you when I found out. The idea of dating someone who takes off their clothes for money - and does God knows what else - is just repelling to me.|`|X5nCVl1vaa	Four months is a while, and he should like you for who you are. That is a part of you. He he can't take it he's a bum. Throw him out and find a decent guy that you deserve.<br>  <br>  Me, the stripper thing wouldn't matter. But if you came out after 4 months and said something like that which I didn't expect I'd wonder what else you were hiding - drugs or something. It's not that stippers do drugs, but if you can hide your entire career from me for four months I'd definately wonder what else you were hiding from me.<br>  <br>  The right moment - thre really isn't a right moment, but the best moment will be when you are sad and he is feeling all protective of you. After you have a particularly hard day at work, complain about it and then mention why it is so difficult to be a stripper.|`|yNxSas2Taa	give him a dance or invite him to it
1PXkhhzQaa	Marriage is so many different things to different people. If you want to be married, you'll have to bring it up and discuss it. You should tell him that you have taken his statements to mean that at some point you would be getting married. There must be more to his reasoning than "women leave and divorce is expensive".<br>  <br>  He may not see the sacrifice in you giving up the possibility of having more children. You do seem to have made some big changes for the relationship. Perhaps he does not see these things as any sort of "sacrifice."<br>  <br>  You can say that you don't believe in staying with someone and not moving toward marriage and that you are ready to make that step.<br>  <br>  People look at marriage completely differently. I'm married and have been for over 15 years. We have four children. If we divorced or my wife passed away, I would never remarry and would tell any partner this up front. Why? To me, marriage is for raising children. To me it has no other purpose. I don't need a sociologically sanctioned ritual and a piece of paper to make me feel committed to someone. You have to find out what marriage is for as far as he is concerned. <br>  <br>  Most of the time, if men talk of marriage and then don't move in that direction over time its because:<br>  1) they don't see themselves with that person long term<br>  2) they don't really want to marry <br>  <br>  You better find out what the real issue is...|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	In this case, I wouldn't hold my breath.  He has even told you that the idea scares him.

62TvIinPaa	Oh dear.. U r in a pretty fix.<br>  <br>  I feel... Its better to tell your father to talk to your mom and ask her mental disturbances. She too might be very fixed. Telling your dad to hang around is also not a bad idea. Try to light the situation... Because happy minds take better decisions.<br>  <br>  Regards,|`|pYomxgYfaa	Your mother may be confused, but tell her she is being selfish. Tell her she had a child with your father, she had you, and if she decides to leave for her ex-husband, than you will no long consider her your mother.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds harsh, but a parent should always put their children first. Tell her she might be confused, but right now, she is in a position where everyone loves her and wants things to work out. Tell her that her ex-husband is her EX for a REASON, and if she decides to go back to him, you guys won't be there for her when she changes her mind.<br>  <br>  You have to be strong and straightforward with her. I'm not saying be mean, but be straight with her and tell her how things are. Tell her that she chose to have children with your father, and she chose to make a family, and she can't just bail on you guys, because when the time comes, you guys will bail on her.<br>  <br>  I really hope things work out for you, I really do. I understand what you are going through, being in the middle is the worst feeling in the world, especially when it comes to parents. You can't choose a side.<br>  <br>  I know you need adivce for your dad, but it's not your dad you should be worried about. Your mother is confused about your father, but not about you. She will be more open to listen to you than she will to your father. I'm not saying its up to you, i'm just saying that your input will mean alot more to her than you think.<br>  <br>  Be nice to your mum, but be straight forward, and tell her that you need her, and if she goes, she will be the biggest disappointment in your life. Tell her both you and your dad love her, but if she chooses to leave, she will lose alot more than she can ever gain back. Good luck, I hope things turn out for the better.

AA11380378	For a free checklist, budgeter and ideas go to:<br>  <br>  www.theknot.com<br>  <br>  It's free. <br>  <br>  Now, if you want a wedding on a budget, the best way of doing this is to:<br>  <br>  - keep it small. Having a small guest list it's the only proved way of cutting costs. Invite immediate family members and very close friends only. Keep it under 40 guests, less if you can. No co-workers, neighbors, HS friends that you haven't talked to in years, no cousins etc. you get the idea<br>  <br>  -Do without: No, you don't need 5 BM, and flowers girls, unity candles, wedding bells, guests books, feather pen, escort cards, programs, garter, limo etc. You won't need all that<br>  <br>  -Borrow. Everyone has an used veil and a cake server set.<br>  <br>  -DYI: Buy invite kits at walmart and Target and print at home in your computer. If you are crafty, do your own bouquet.<br>  <br>  -Have a cake and toast reception, bbq reception, hors d'ouvres or potluck reception. Those are the most affordable choices.<br>  <br>  -Skip the alcohol. Have a sparkling cider toast, soda, tea and lemonade and avoid the high cost (and mess) of alcohol. If you must, offer just a sparkling wine toast and sodas, coffee, tea only.<br>  <br>  -Venue. Someone's backyard, residence, public park, church's fellowship hall or local community center are the most affordable options. YMCA, VFW, Elk's lodge and Moose Lodge are also affordable choices.<br>  <br>  -Cake. Super walmart and most supermarkets offer a catalogue with a wide variety of wedding cake designs, Save!<br>  <br>  -Craigslist.Ebay. You won't believe how many brides are trying to get rid of their wedding leftovers for very little money. From wedding dresses, to left over blank invites, ribbons, decor etc. you can really get a good deal. I've even seem free stuff too.<br>  <br>  -Enroll the help of Uncle Tom to take the pictures and cousin Larry to help with the music.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats|`|9YWmMyT7aa	Where are you getting married? <br>  <br>  You will need:<br>  Ceremony site<br>  Reception site<br>  center pieces for your reception <br>  invitations <br>  stamps <br>  music for the ceremony and reception <br>  dress for you and your bridesmaids <br>  gifts for your wedding party<br>  shoes <br>  favors to give your guests <br>  dance lessons for your first dance <br>  cake <br>  alcohol<br>  wedding rings <br>  veil<br>  photographer <br>  hair and makeup person <br>  accommodations for your wedding night <br>  transportation from the ceremony to your reception site  <br>  a wedding website <br>  Marriage License - check the requirements in the state where you are getting married <br>  Just to name a few things...<br>  <br>  To save money....<br>  You can print your own invitations, you can go to Walton.com or go to hobby lobby, Michale, or any craft store and get the print your own invitations. I would wait until the summer when they are on sale. I just got married on 1/31/09 and I was able to get all of my invitations 50% off.<br>  <br>  I made our favors.

We were also able to get our dj and photographer a little bit cheaper for that reason too.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to haggle the cost of everything. Most people are willing to work with you.<br>  <br>  Go to theknot.com, simple weddings, wedding channel, Martha Stewart and they have lot's of check lists. <br>  <br>  Don't stress!! this is a fun time for you and your groom.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	1. get your invites from Michael's or Walmart or something (they have GREAT kits that you can just print at home.<br>  2. Make your own centrepieces (non floral).  Use vases or floating candles or..i don't now, look around and get creative<br>  3. Make your own favours. Candy never fails. lol<br>  4. Decorate the hall yourself (don't hire people to do it)<br>  5. Look for pre-worn dresses (avoid anything being sent from china though) They are just as beautiful as new ones, but 1/2 the price. Also check out www.bridalonlinestore.com  That's where I got mine. $1200 dress for $400 and it is PERFECT!<br>  6. Have a buffet. EXACT same food as a sit down dinner but 1/2 the price.<br>  <br>  <br>  start planning now. Head to <a href="http://www.theknot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.theknot.com</a> (it's free) and you'll get a to do list (based on your wedding date).  If you start now you can stay on top of things and not get stressed at the last minute.  The site also gives you a budgeting tool (so you know approx how much to spend on each item based on your budget).  A guest list organizer, and a payment tracker.<br>  <br>  Also, head to Chapters or any book store and pick up a wedding planner/organizer.  It'll keep all your info organized and in one place.

It would be nice and intimate<br>  since it would be some one close to you and your<br>  future hubby, right? And you might get them to do it<br>  for free too ;)<br>  <br>  I would say send out invites a few months ahead - maybe<br>  two or three so you have time to get their responses,<br>  find out who's coming and where to seat every one.<br>  You should also see if you can get hotel discounts if<br>  any of your guests are flying from a far place.<br>  <br>  Hope all goes well!<br>  Congrats!<br>  <br>  ~
f2YVJu6haa	i think that you need to back off a bit because she obviously doesnt know what she wants right now but always stay by her side as a friend because her boyfriend doesnt sound very nice, one day im sure it will work out between you 2 and remember he took her virginity so he will still always be important to her <br>  good luck!|`|IdtzdpqGaa	your story is inconsistent, how could you not say anything to her for two years but some how still manage to kiss and stuff without talking.|`|AA10500537	let her break up with the bf before you move in on her
AA11380378	Go early. <br>  <br>  Reason being: May happens to be PROM season and the tux places will be crowded with teenagers and eager parents. Trust me on this one, the store will not be able to provide you with the time and service that a wedding deserves because they are too busy helping little Johny and the entire town's HS. April and May are the bussiest months due to prom season.<br>  <br>  I would say, right after the holidays would be a great time, with no crowds and ample time to decide. You can pick up a catalogue in advance to check for styles at home and have narrowed your search.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA11082914	If you haven't registered the guys yet, I'd do it now. May 9th is right in the middle of prom season and if you wait too late you won't be given the personal attention you deserve.|`|BnJRwJiEaa	No I think it will be ok because it will give the groomsmen plenty of time to save the money to pay for the tuxes.|`|03n14OLLaa	After the dresses so that you can be sure to match. It's easier to match tux to dress than dress to tux. Good Luck!|`|AA11143998	A month would probably be good|`|K542Db29aa	a month in a half at least not now. you can go and pick out the style and colors you want but don't have them come down to try them on just yet, some may loose weight some may gain then you have to refit all over again :) take the soon to be hubby with you and have him put some input on what he likes to, gets some time together the 2 of you:)|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	Accordingly to some bridal websites/magazines, 6-8 weeks before the ceremony is the proper deadline. This should give you time to find something, get it shipped (if needed), and fitted and tailored. It allows you to breathe and have some wiggle room if something goes wrong with the fitting and tailoring to make corrections.|`|xuiSfzgraa	You can go pick them out anytime within a month before your wedding.  The guys can get fitted after you have them picked out. If you do pick them out now, they may want to go back 2-3 weeks before the wedding to make sure they don't need to alter anything.|`|b1xQKDEraa	ive got mine sorted with 15 months to go! we had the date so thought why wait. our shop had bookings for 2012 so we werent even the earliest!|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Actually, I heard from Modern Tux that groomsmen should go 8 months before the wedding!!<br>  <br>  I don't think that's necessarily true... BUT, again, men are easy.  They go in for their measurements, and that's pretty much it.  They are done.  So, I would go whenever they want to.<br>  <br>  If they are ready, go for it.  :)  Better safe than sorry.
H3WHxCgaaa	LMAO - not right - but funny as hell!|`|AA12275780	Good idea.  I like underground and I like sex.   :-)<br>  <br>  But to be more serious.   Eventually we will not reproduce normally.   We will grow fresh parts within us, Our babies will be us.   Our minds will stay entact even as our bodies go through shifts of body tissue replacment from within.  This would be an amazing future for us.   I think we will still want to reproduce the other way though and we will need to as we may expand into space, and people still die from accidents and murders and other natrual events.   But we would need to slow donw.  Each couple would have to wait hunderds of years to have children.  But they have longer lifespans so they have children always in the fittest shape.   This would be an amazing future because people would be able to retain their greatest minds; and for the not so greatest minds, they will have time to learn to be great!    A bonus would be that we would be capable of having foresight to look into the deep future instead of saying, well Ill be dead by then anyways so who cares.   (my children's children's children's don't matter to me)|`|CF1R0TPvaa	My wife might agree with one caveat, you need to let them go to work to keep the money coming in, and you also might call them upstairs occasionally to dislodge a crap in a plugged toilet.<br>  <br>  Reminds me of a year ago when an Austrian man was charged with keeping some kids in the basement for their whole lives.

This is made that much worse if she likes you. But I would talk to her and see what happens between you two. Worse case scenario she doesn't like you and she keeps ignoring you.|`|UIhbJjQFaa	i get so embarrassed when a guy i like glances at me usually because i think he's seen my glancing at him|`|zFhQJtt9aa	go up to her and to talk to her|`|lBkLzGodaa	oh yeah <br>  its a habit really lol <br>  she likes you <br>  fer sure|`|eqqpIbTsaa	Totally she likes you. Im kinda a shy girl and I do that when ever I see the boy that I really really like!

Get on that topic with her and then be like well do you have texting or something and be like well here is my number call or txt me any time! something like that or try to sit next to her in class!|`|hXFndli2aa	Yep i am a shy girl, and we do that because we are afraid to make eye contact with a guy we like or find attractive.|`|tmr7xQXlaa	you sound like the shy one..... just go up and talk to her!|`|SqDXxAeGaa	def being shy does that at one point i was and still kinda am when i really like a guy so yah we catch each other's stare's all the time and there's never a word between us so yah it's a thing but total guess says she likes you|`|HykE5X0Laa	Yea, she's shy to some extent but she does notices you. Maybe you should make the first move. <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|Y5aN1Xvmaa	Yes, if she is shy she would be embarrassed that you caught her looking at you|`|aez7WCqQaa	Well, she could be purposefully looking the other way because she finds eye contact awkward. I'm like that.<br>  <br>  But also, just because she looks away doesn't mean she's interested or embarrassed, it could mean that she doesn't want you to think she was staring at you out of recognition. I see the same people around campus and majority of the time, I will look down or away because it's kinda offbeat to look directly at someone while passing. They will probably seem shocked someone actually stared, you know?<br>  <br>  But, I'm not eliminating a possibility that she couldn't be digging you. Smile next time, and maybe just go up and say "Hey, I see you around all the time. I figure we should at least introduce ourselves" as an icebreaker.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!
uzIiaT4oaa	Its up to you. I hjave legal custody of my daughter but she has both our names hyphenated.|`|6W7nJYskaa	Depends. Are they together? <br>  <br>  If the mother is no longer with the father she could list the child's last name as her own. If they are together though and in love then I presume the natural thing would be for her to give the child it's fathers last name.<br>  <br>  Some people go double barreled that's an option.<br>  <br>  :-)|`|4EWCegiRaa	The parents decide.  Typically (and by typically I mean not everyone), the baby takes the father's last name just because that what society feels is right (even though I don't know why society feels that way but they do)|`|RmDFsL04aa	Whichever you choose to be on the birth certificate i think.<br>  My parents were not married and i took my dads last name but changed it by deed poll anyway :)|`|sU3y1CrIaa	its up to you.  My son has mine.|`|60c8rJxZaa	That is all up to you (and him if still together). When the baby is born you fill out the birth certificate and you can put down either or.

Good luck.|`|eybHcHz9aa	In my case, I'd say the father's because I love him very much, and not only is it traditional, but it also helps when people trace the family history.

I myself would put her last name dash his.|`|slZwNrCoaa	normally the fathers, especially if marriage is a possibility in the future (thats if you're still together i suppose)|`|KgKAFvEBaa	Technically you can name your child anything you want to.  They don't necessarily have to take on either surname.  However, it is your decision.  While it is customary to use the father's name, this is not always the case; I have two boys with the same father, and we were never married.  I gave them both my last name.  I am glad I did that, too, because now their father and I are no longer together!|`|pNTPiTWmaa	you can actually give your baby a name that has nothing to do with either of u...you can give them your great great great grandmas last name if u wanted...its totally up 2 u|`|c3b0303b45fbe6430dc388e695c7e5eaaa	You can give your baby any name you want.the mums or dads surname

unVj43Xxaa	No don't text him. Let him come after you. Since you both just got out of relationships it's possible this is a, "forget the ex, rebound fling". Let him come to you.|`|AMTYPir7aa	well i suppose just one more couldn't hurt but make sure if he does not respond to that one let it go. if he replies then he does but be prepared just in case he does not.|`|IkAtIQumaa	No wait for him to txt you [=|`|kKbega8yaa	text him he could feel like txting you would make him annoying and clingy so go for it|`|52aab5cb1f0ddf6af7d42b5a3ae2096baa	you should totally txt him and just say hey and go frm there
tGEHK7TTaa	I love Mystery Dinner Parties! Basically, it's a Murder Mystery and the people eating (you guys!) are the suspects!  Most of the time there is a theme, like one I did was in France in the 40's on a train.  So you dress in costume, and you take a role.  They are usually funny and you get a script.  There are clues and sound clips, everyone reads the parts they get.  You have to try to figure out who the murderer is.  It's super fun if everyone is into it.  Just try to not be embarrassed and have a great time!! The first time I played I ended up being the murderer and I didn't know til the end.  I loved it!!|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Interactive dinner experience where some people in the audience play apart in the mystery. You get parts of drama, a play and interaction, they are really fun if done correctly!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3M3htWrBaa	it is a horror dinner party with the guests as the suspects and the guests get to interact together and solve the mystery|`|pjYn6PbCaa	I always thought it was oral sex with a blindfold on.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	It's almost like live Clue...<br>  I haven't experienced one, but always wanted to!!  Sound so much fun!! :)<br>  <a href="http://www.entourage-entertainment.com/murder_mystery.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.entourage-entertainment.com/m...</a>|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	No idea. I would imagine it is most likely a dinner where there is a mystery-themed play going on at the same time that guests are eating.|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	It's a Clue-style dinner. Like the game clue there will be a mystery to solve. This is done in several different ways. Either everyone will have an assigned part, even the killer, and people must dress up accordingly, or it's just a regular mystery that the guests have to investigate with clues. There are a couple of party board games that specialize in these events/parties. The party kit, will have the mystery that everyone will know, and each person at the party will either have to work/find clues, or have clues given to them and everyone has to figure out the mystery. Generally, the mystery is a murder, i.e. Who murder Professor Green? something to that effect. They can be a lot of fun. Next time you are in the game isle at Walmart/Target/Game store stop in the board game/party game aisle. There should be several versions of Clue and a mystery kit available.|`|BnJRwJiEaa	I never heard of it but I will love to know what it is.  I think it maybe something like a solving a mystery the plot maybe centered around the bride and groom and you then learn more about your wedding party.  This is just a guess.|`|03n14OLLaa	It's like a murder mystery to solve while you eat. My aunt went to one one time.|`|T2QieSzPaa	All those people who described it as a Clue-type "play" where everyone dresses in costume, has a script etc. are totally correct. I did one that was a murder mystery set in China (I was assigned the part of a retired Chinese detective). We ate Chinese food, dressed up, etc. It was LOTS of fun...<br>  <br>  Except...<br>  <br>  This was for my friend's 11th birthday party. Very Important Question: this is just for an "extra" dinner, not related to the wedding reception, right? If so, it's an awesome idea and will be a great memory for all of you in the wedding party. But if this is the idea for the reception dinner (which I'm not sure it is), then I would say NO--it's NOT for a wedding. I know a wedding should be fun, but shouldn't the focus be on the new couple, NOT on figuring out who killed whom in 19th-century France? I reiterate, it's fun, but not appropriate (and I think lots of nontraditional things are wedding-appropriate, just not this idea).
Bf8PVFSSaa	Eat Funyuns.|`|eeGjzAAcaa	Yea i think it means a lot since she has a fear of wrists. Seems pretty monumental.

Nd83V8iuaa	It is single for me. I am free to do whatever I want with no responsibility whatever. What can be better than that?|`|AA11585161	When I was a much younger man I was a strong supporter of the single lifestyle.  However as I have aged and matured a bit I now have to vote for the married life.  Being single in old age must be a very lonely and at times lonesome existence.  But if you are married and have family to share life with it makes things so much easier and more rewarding.  Regardless of the fights and arguments that accompany family life I still would select this over being single any day.|`|9dqG2ZSRaa	married|`|4HoVVCenaa	single, unless you have kids.

4EWCegiRaa	Here's the deal: <br>  <br>  ALOT (and I mean alot) of women will say "I won't sleep with you" but secretly do. They just want you to try harder.  So if you try a couple more times, they'll usually sleep with you (because they want to).<br>  <br>  Personally, I won't beg for sex so I won't do that but you would be amazed how often that happens.  And the only way to find out if she means no when she says it is to try a couple more times.<br>  <br>  --->Obviously no means no and I'm not encouraging any sort of force on any level at all<--- but I've stop pursuing women who said no and they later tell me they wanted to and just wanted me to keep trying.  How is a guy supposed to know?<br>  <br>  You should just be very clear with him.  Sit him him down and explain it makes you uncomfortable and he MUST stop.|`|U4AwP0p8aa	Maybe it's a nice one.  Guys like him are persistent.  If you truly don't want to have sex with him you better watch yourself, because it sounds like he will be ready to pounce once your smashed.|`|QMRq8Cneaa	Hes a perverted creep. Stay as far away from him as you can. He just wants to have sex with you, and hes desperate. Hes also not respecting your body at all. Try to go to less parties that include him in them, and like i said, STAY AWAY FROM HIM. The next step, he could slip a pill in your drink, and rape you. No joke, this guy is going to far. Hes scary.
AXbdNdPzaa	He has a lot of excuses.  He needs to cut his hair.  He obviously doesn't want to work.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	"won't" hire him, then he must have something wrong with his work history.  All I know is that if my husband is ever out of work he FINDS a place to work.  It may be a crappy job, but a job is a job!  He could always try day labor.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	He's just going to have to suck up his pride, and work where there's jobs. Even fast-food jobs are better than NO job. You can't be picky in this terrible economy.<br>  <br>  Either that, or go to school to train for the jobs that ARE out there, like nurses.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	I can't understand this...I see help wanted sign all ove coming into work every day, how can you not find a job, even if it is Not in your field of expertise...they are everywhere!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	he needs to find a job fast. try looking on craigslist.com the local papers and of course he could go to the workforce commision and they can help him find something|`|pRF5LLloaa	Times are tough all over.  it IS a sh--ty world out there -- especially now!<br>  <br>  Your marriage vows probably said something to the effect of "for better or for worse".  This is the "worse" part.  As his wife, it is your moral duty to be supportive in any way necessary -- physically, emotionally, and financially -- in these tough times.<br>  <br>  But understand that HE need to find at least part time work -- shoveling hamburgers at Jack in the Box if he has too.  Demeaning, I know, but it IS a job, and it DOES bring income into the household.  And as a part time job it leaves him free to continue to look for employment.<br>  <br>  You married him -- this is for the long haul.  Have patience, he is not the only one with this problem.  His unemployment is not entirely his fault, so cut him some slack, tell him you love him, and give him the emotional support that he needs.|`|0W4S6J5maa	he needs to rework his resume. You don't have to lie, but you can embellish some.<br>  <br>  Even in this economy there are jobs. Fast food, walmart, etc....it might not be the most glamorous jobs but they pay and that's what counts. He can always look for something better while he is working and when the economy picks up.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Can't or Won't?  Fast food is always hiring...it may not be the dream job, but it's a job and it will get you through.  People can be way too picky - work is work and in a pinch you've got to do what you've got to do.|`|X5aMV1Pmaa	He's going to have to take a job anywhere, even if it's McDonalds.  He's got to do something to bring home money - and you might want to consider switching to full time.|`|tCI8ksvdaa	What you are saying is he will not do what is necessary to get a job.  Sorry to tell you lady but you married a bum!  Maybe you should consider divorce!|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	In this economy, I would think part time is better than nothing.  At least it will help a little until something full time comes available.  Some tips, though, make sure his resume is up to date, and there are plenty of online sites to help spruce up the wording, etc so it looks better.  Also, don't be shy about calling up possible employers that you have already submitted applications to, and ask them if they have had a chance to look over it, and when you can expect to have an interview.  Showing that you are proactive and excited about going to work there can really help them see that you could be a valuable asset.
sreMwgOgaa	explain to your mum that you really think the man has changed, he seems so different and respectable and your sure that hes not going to be doing anything while you at there house, your friend and there siblings will be there and so will his wife. Hes a grown man and he understands he shouldn't be doing that anyway, your friend wouldn't invite you if she thought her dad would lash out or do anything because that would mean something embarrasing. Just tell your mum you will give her a call if anything gets out of hand and that your pretty sure it wont.<br>  hope that helps!|`|3RBRrM30aa	Just tell your friend the truth "Mom doesn't want me to stay the night".<br>  She should understand that you obviously can't go against what your Mom tells you to do. <br>  <br>  As for your Mom, she probably just doesn't want to you be exposed to an alcoholic, that cheated on his wife. Or just doesn't trust him with you. which is really smart, I was raped by a guy like that. That doesn't mean its 100% that he'll do that to you, but be safe use your head.<br>  <br>  Get he to stay at your house.|`|TOe9RPbeaa	ok, that's hard.<br>  what ever you do DONT HURT HER FEELINGS.<br>  just say something like..

Please" or if you feel comfortable lying to your mom, tell her that her father works at night.|`|at3hb7Vraa	You should ask your mom if you can have her sleep over at your house.  Then ask your friend if she want to sleep over.|`|jBxW6ee9aa	Try asking you mom WHY she won't let you. If she keeps saying no, don't have a cow about it just acknowledge her answer and then ask if it is alright to set another time to sleep over at your friends house. Your mom will let you do more things if you show you respect her answers and don't push her. I know it sucks, but If you react calmly to her you will have a better chance. Hope this helps, and I get more of what I want when I do this, so I hope this works for you, and it may take time for her to come around. Just remember to stay calm. =3|`|AE9aauACaa	When you leave just go by mum love you see you tommorow and just leave, or say that whats going on between her parents has nothin to do with you sleeping over.

That is the best thing to do and your not lying to her so she should understand. Or you can ask your mom to trust you that if anything goes wrong that you would call her. Hope this helps. And have fun at your sleep over.|`|AA10874773	i'd tell mom what my situation is & see what she suggests.  she'll be pleased you came to her with a problem, but she'll be even more pleased that you choose to talk it out with her rather than lying to someone.  trust me - talk to mom & see what she says.|`|YkJeYixnaa	aww c'mon youre mom broke up with youre dad so c'mon she'll feel lonely!|`|VtJ5kRgIaa	she doesnt want you guys to have sex!

oHN6jwjoaa	a lot of girls are looking for a long relationship.<br>  then when a girl doesnt have that she <br>  goes out and has sex with whoever she wants.<br>  its not the best decision. but thats what happens.<br>  especially when a girl doesnt want to be lonely<br>  almost to the point of desperation.|`|LcOPL8gCaa	Yes avoiding physical itimacy is most of it, we want to make sure your real. Like i just told some one else. Its not fun to trust someone with your everything and have that trust broken. Yes we are looking for a solid person with a secure relationship and if its not proven to us, we back off and shut down then completely ignore you. =] its our safety. Guys just go hang out with mates and make fun of the girl, for not wanting to have sex or what ever. When the girl is prob in tears talking with her best friend thinking of ways to cut your dic* off when your asleep.<br>  <br>  Cheers =]|`|cydakP87aa	not all girls want commitment.<br>  but if you are smart you will want a girl who is willing to commit.<br>  you dont want one who is going to commit to fast and be psycho<br>  but you do want one who at least can<br>  especially if you are having sex you should want at least some level of commitment, i mean you dont want a girl who is sleeping with a lot of guys cuz that is how stds are spread.<br>  i guess it depends on what you want in a girl<br>  you can pretty much find a girl for whatever level of commitment you are interested in|`|xzKwyQEqaa	I'm a guy and I often wonder this too. Why do some women go for the absolute worse guys? It's strange. But I think that you can tell when you get to know a girl if she is a good girl and would want a stable relationship or if she is lowly and shallow and would settle for a bad guy.|`|AA11506593	Women, like men, are all different. There are times when we want a no strings attached fling. There are other times in our lives when we want a committed relationship.|`|BhyvJciTaa	not all women are the same, though the majority are emotional because thats the way we are, so get used to it|`|HP0WqWXYaa	Yes you are right, ladies prefer serious relationship.|`|V6CFNRRvaa	yea you are right|`|DNwHGeEtaa	I can't talk for other women/girls. But for myself, I don't need physical relationship. So if I don't like the guy and don't want to be with him, I won't have any physical relationship with him. I only do it with someone I like and care about. Physical intimacy doesn't please me if it is not with the man I like (while most guys don't care who they have sex with as long as they get sex they're happy). Physical intimacy is something I do to honor my relationship with a man and in return I expect him to honor me with a commitment.|`|XnfkwUtdaa	I personally want a relationship and not a fling. I'm like that because I don't want to waste my time with a guy that will eventually leave me. We are naturally attracted to guys who can protect us for a long time because then we feel secure with them and now that they will be there for the long run. Us girls want to build more of an emotional connection rather than a physical one.|`|nFOllgtDaa	Yup all women are different some rather have a fling and not get their feelings invovled just so they won't get hurt or their heart broken|`|tcWHF9AEaa	Honestly.... Si (yes)<br>  If he is looking to be intimate and no relationship... even if it's short term I would <br>  hold off. However, If attracted to him--- we <br>  could get the job done w/o actually doing the deed.|`|R1gqthbmaa	Your questions has a lot of possible answers. A woman/girl most of the times is serious about a relationship, but only if she likes a guy. Because she is with him because she likes him, and maybe something more, and she will hurt a lot if they break up. If they just want to have fun as you said they will say nothing about serious relationships and stuff. I'll bring you for example myself.<br>  If my 6-months-crush finally get to know me and starts talking to me and that leads to a relationship, I'll be very happy but also protective and I'll want a serious relationship, because I love that guy and from the time I find him I wouldn't wanna lose him, because I'd be desperate.<br>  If someone else, who I just find appealing had a relationship with me, of course and I would never hurt  him, but I wouldn't want a serious relationship. Just a simple one, neither serious nor to pass my time. (no that it would ever happen, neither with my crush neither with the other boy I find appealing... :(...)<br>  Everything depends on the person!<br>  Hope it helped!|`|zr5WwMwVaa	well it really matters to me cuz then i know that if i decide to be intamit with the guy that he wont think im a hoe and he will just see it as us making love<br>  <br>  i think a few women will agree <br>  <br>  cause a lot of women care about ehat other ppl think about them so if they just have little flings they will be considred easy and guys that hear about them will only want sex from them<br>  <br>  and all women want to get married a one point so the want to have a good rep.<br>  <br>  and for the girls that dont want a commitment then they are more likely to get divorces <br>  <br>  hopefully you understand what im trying to say cuz part of my answer sounds like im ranting on lol<br>  <br>  <br>  :^)|`|QPTlQCiSaa	I am 23 and I want a solid, safe, and secure relationship.  I am in a relationship just like that.  But at first I wanted a one night stand, so did he... I was on a site called www.plentyoffish.com its a free dating site.  So I started talking to this guy, seemed nice, and you could really tell he wanted JUST SEX.  So after talking a few times over the phone, I found out he worked about 4 miles from where I worked. So we met at his work and went to his house at like 5 am, had amazing sex and I took a shower and left.  A few weeks later we kept this up, to the point I was pretty much living there.  One night after we were together I said I gotta get going and he said, "Please don't I need you here, I love you."   Changed my life forever.   Now I am preggo with his baby... everyone is different!!!!!|`|XbZIicftaa	You should not assume anything.  Women don't always want a commitment, I "dated" men when I was younger without commitment and without an actual relationship.<br>  <br>  I chose my husband because I loved him like no other and we decided to commit ourselves to each other.  I definitely didnt feel that way about all the men i dated ;)|`|Q9sjbSkqaa	im only 16 but i say that if my boyfriend whishes to hav fun then he can go hav fun with whoever so it maybe im not all about commitment because i dont believe in tieing a guy down to me i usally get told wat to do in a relationship and i dont like it so much so i dont do it to the guys...... but yes they usally do they just want a friend but some may end up serious|`|agLImxKTaa	The younger the girl, the more likely she still believes the fairy tale, live happily ever after ideal.  Sure we all want to be in a serious relationship men and women both...  but the older a woman is the more likely she is to know the difference between mr right and mr right now.   Always err on the side of caution by assuming she wants an exclusive relationship and go from there.  You'll get a bad rep otherwise and all it takes is one girl calling you a s c u m b a g and before you know it, all girls think badly of you...  If a girl is avoiding intimacy then she isn't into you.  Most girls assume if you sleep with them you love them.  So the sooner you sleep with them, the sooner they think they're in love with you.|`|ixvzhoGUaa	Girls/woman do usually want the best of both worlds in a relationship: physical intimacy, and an emotional/mental connection. that is what a great relationship is ! it depends on the girl. some girls just want to have flings, but the thing is, most of the time these girls will hurt you in the end or maybe even be unfaithful. It's good to be with someone who cares about you and wants a long term relationship that really has meaning and intimacy, not just holding hands & kissing. of course this all depends on the maturity level of both people, not age. If you want to be with someone that doesn't really care too much about You as much as they do physical contact, that's fine, you can go ahead. but if you actually want a meaningful connection with someone, that's usually more fulfilling & beautiful =) I hope i helped !
hVKYVJ89aa	she either just wanted your opinion, <br>  <br>  or she likes you and wants to see if you like her, judging by what you say back.|`|vh9i9IsIaa	May be she just wanted your idea.<br>  I'm like that, I ask even strangers' view about my <br>  new look, haircut, hair color...|`|KIzrFkYAaa	Well,if you are a boy then she probably likes you and wanted to know what you thought. If not, sounds to me like she was fishing for compliments,and was so desperate she decided to ask random people LOL.

1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	I don't necessarily have a problem with a 16 year old drinking with their parents.  My kids have always had wine with us at dinner.  It's a cultural thing practiced most places in the world.<br>  <br>  However, drinking a glass of wine with dinner and encouraging a minor to get drunk are very different things.  We figure that, with our boys, alcohol is not a mystery to them.  They're used to drinking it and they understand that the purpose is not to lose control.<br>  <br>  What your sister taught herr son is a totally different lesson.  Drinking is for "having fun" and getting drunk.  Of course, this isn't a problem for her because, in her 40s, she's still living that life.  Kind of sad.<br>  <br>  This is very damaging.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	I am with you. She just gave him her seal of approval. Some parents think if they permit the behavior, the child will get it out of their system or be able to control it since they do it at home. Actually, children will interpret it as permission and increase the behavior in many cases. We need to remember that we are the adults and they are the children. They do not have the ability to reason fully until their twenties. Forget the people saying 'when I was his age I did this...". They do not have the ability to reason, that is physiological. So what happens when he thinks he can control his liquor due to his vast experience and someone needs a ride? Your sister is playing with fire.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	Your whole answer is in your last sentence.  Is "party hard" a euphemism for alcoholism or drug addiction?  Because in my experience once people get out of college and they continue to "party hard"  they usually have some kind of problem with substance abuse.  She doesn't see the problem, she's not going to change because you tell her it's wrong.  This a point the two of you are going to have to agree to disagree on.  Just make sure you don't leave her in charge of your kids because she's going to let them drink.<br>  <br>  But yes, IMO:  Parents who allow their kids to get smashed "because everyone else does"  haven't grown up themselves and are negligent and irresponsible.  A glass of wine at dinner for a mature 15 or 16 year old is vastly different from allowing your underage child to "party".|`|5DJcir9saa	There are some parents who believe, its better that their child is with them drinking then off god knows where doing it.  I definitely don't agree.  However, it is their child and they can choose to do what they want.  All you can do is teach your daughter that although its ok for him its not okay for her.|`|egN478Bbaa	To each his own!  If they feel that if they let their son drink when they are around, and it is helping him and he isnt hiding it, then let them do it.  No parent is a perfect parent.  Who is to say ur daughter isnt drinking behind ur back. And please dont think "bc she said so".  I pulled that one over on my parents.   I would rather be w/ my child if they are drinking and knw that I have their back but talk to them and let them know the issues rather than them hiding it from me.
OIJ3JBkSaa	yep but keep this in mind - when you are standing at the top of the aisle and you see him at the alter waiting for you everything else will be wiped right out of your mind - all you will see is him and when you see the love in his eyes you'll be fine!  no worries sweetie - you'll float down the aisle - happy wedding!|`|JtEBaOdjaa	The nerves are more about the people staring at you than getting married.  It's normal.  Even I'm nervous and I've been on National TV at least once a week for the past year.  I have no problem talking in front of the whole country but walking down the aisle and saying vows in front of 50 family members and friends terrifies me!|`|4459a617a0f5dd8c54421a39f39f8ed4aa	Have you thought maybe it's nerves and not really nausea? It's your big day and you're marrying the man you love.<br>  <br>  All eyes will be on you. It's like getting up in speech class, everyone is staring at you, but remember it'll be friends and family in the audience. People who love you.<br>  <br>  I admit I got butterflies when I did a church walk-thru with our wedding coordinator. Especially when she said, "this is the door you'll be walking thru!"<br>  <br>  Calm down, take a deep breath. It'll be ok.|`|bf6K6uubaa	it might be your perfectionism kicking in...are you getting nauseous cause you want everything to be perfect and because you know there are no do overs...if so thats normal...if you're nervous cause you don't want to spend the rest of your life with this person remember that if you don't want to do this you don't have to...|`|QmvYGkNJaa	VERY normal! You're just nervous; it doesn't mean you love your fiance any less. Just take some deep breaths and remember why you're marrying him, how much you love him, how this wedding will be the best day of your life so far.<br>  <br>  I couldn't sleep at all last week because I kept having dreams about our wedding day. And if it wasn't our wedding day; I would be dreaming about the week leading up to it. I was waking myself up all the time. <br>  <br>  And my wedding's still 4 months away. I dread to think what I'll be like nearer the time!<br>  <br>  I think my worries come when I think about how big a step marriage is, and also that people might criticise our wedding, because we're on a tight budget. It's hard, but you have to let it all go and think of you and your fiance.|`|e50edc701ca7a4e8c4b48c44b142d895aa	of course its normal, its a big thing your on show to so many people, stage fright is a very common feeling. breath deeply and dont forget everyone around is your friends and family they are there for you and they love you, they will just be oooohin and ahhhin at how beautiful you are.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	I had that feeling after i left the bridal store after trying on wedding dresses for the first time...i think it was sooo overwhelming...i felt sick for the rest of the day and my fiance was worried..Im ok now...<br>  <br>  you should just relax.. we all get nervous for different reasons...you'll be ok, just look at him when you are walking...or look for familiar faces so you wont get so nervous...<br>  <br>  good luck|`|eSkNDqLKaa	As I was told back in Drama Class...imagine all the people sitting in the aisles naked and keep your eye on the target...the groom!  It is totally natural to be nervous, you're the center of attention, but know that it's only a flash of a moment in your life!  You'll get through it!|`|5DJcir9saa	Most likely its because you're nervous about everyone focusing on you.  It has nothing to do with the fact that you're getting married...just that you'll be the center of attention.  I felt the same way =)|`|q8eue7CRaa	It's nerves! Try to relax. Make sure you eat something light that day so your blood sugar is in check. If it's a nervous butterflies in stomach, you're fine!|`|FzFSzilmaa	nerves, pure and simple...all those eye watching you... catching everything you MIGHT do wrong... the embarrassment...|`|BnJRwJiEaa	Yes but try to stay calm|`|R07ach0Waa	omg even though its been over forty years i can remember that feeling!  lol  i thought i was going to throw up all the way down the aisle but you know once i got there and focused on my man i was fine -to this day if i'm in a situation or place that i feel scared or nervous all i have to do is focus on him - he tips me that little wink of his and i'm calm again!  god love him - he still has it!  lol<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  edit:  i have a question - everyone here has given nice answers so why are we all getting thumbs down for them?  that isn't very nice at all|`|b1xQKDEraa	its normal, i got nervous trying on my dress. its the realisation that 1. the day has finally come and 2. its actually happening and 3. everyone is watching! just enjoy it and relax... oh and congrats!|`|XNQG7dHQaa	You're just nervous, hun. <br>  But the moment will be gone in a flash, so savor the wedding day. I don't even remember walking down the aisle because I was SO nervous!|`|ACecbVghaa	Nerves are normal, don't worry! Just take a deep breathe before you go and keep your eyes on your future!|`|CkN4pgpCaa	I sure hope so.  I am terrified.  It's going to be so weird having 200 people staring at me!|`|mvKDbb2uaa	Fo some it is.  For many, it's really a form of stage fright.  The thought of walking down the aisle and having all eyes on you CAN be daunting, but it'll be okay.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Sounds like you have stage fright and don't like being the center of attention. I think it's pretty common. An anti-anxiety medication can help.
8P6MmLv0aa	Well that's his problem then.|`|hEAuWYYjaa	what you should do if you really want to stay with him is compromise, that is what relationships are about.you have two choices, either stop the noises or find a guy that likes you for you and your funny voices|`|pCEAIihqaa	Doesn't sound like you are meant for each other, hold out for a guy who appreciates everything about you..|`|4wnPK7Uaaa	Omg please don't tell me your like one of those girls who do like those stupid cartoon voices....|`|YVNBwkCxaa	Listen its ur life u tell him u can live and say wuteva u want and no one will change that... u are who u are... dont let nobody tell u to change the way u act... u have a freedom for that and no one even ur boyfriend should tell u to stop makin funny voices... be strong and tell that n i g g a off|`|SR1FN2nqaa	stop doing it if he doesnt like it. that is if you want to maintain your relationship im guessing. generally if you are with someone and do something they dont like you stop doing it.|`|Tul6FvDXaa	If you really like this guy, cut it out.

My boyfriend tells me I'm a freak, but I'm his freak and he loves me. I usually take it as a compliment, because I think he's partly joking, and he's okay with it. Hahha, you should have the same.|`|60c8rJxZaa	He may not mind them but maybe you do them at inappropriate times.

pDrkcc6taa	You are sort of answering your own question.  I think your resentment of his not having a job is what's making you think of greener pastures.  You should get some neutral counseling.  I think your husband might need to get some help in finding a job and you need to be honest with him about your feelings.  Why would you want to throw away so many years without giving it the best try you can.  TALK TO HIM...but you h ave to talk to him and YOURSELF HONESTLY.  Good Luck!|`|tsBL19qzaa	Just keep jacking around, and you will have wasted another 7 years trying to end the relationship.<br>  <br>  You want to be mature about it, you just tell him. And that doesn't mean screaming, yelling, or any other childish antics.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	well it isnt his fauly if he got laid off, that is happening everywhere. he can go out and find something else or at least attempt to.talk to him about it and see what he suggest you can do to get out of the so called void.|`|SovaFpN8aa	Just say:<br>  "You are boring, and now you don't spend any money on me, so I'm gonna bail now! If you get a good paying job, just call me and maybe we can hook up again - gotta go - bye!"|`|NnN4drsbaa	just do it. It dont matter how "civil" you are, to him you're going to be a  "B" and more until he gets on with life. Thats just the fact of it. If you are going to leave it best to do it sooner so as to get it over and done with, as opposed to dragging it out and and end end hating each other for life|`|srAP6Vzvaa	he is a big boy. he can take a girl leaving him. just tell him straight up and then leave. if he is a REAL MAN he will be civil about it. but if he is selfish, greedy, and possessive he is going to be a jerk about it and say mean things.|`|sgkvXvNTaa	Is there really ever a good time for this? NO! However, it has to be done it sounds like and really I feel it's better for the both of you not to invest anymore time. I'm sure you two have learned a lot from each other and that all in all the time spent together was not "wasted" as we all grow through different circumstances. Perhaps he is feeling the same way and doesn't know how to bring it up either? Whatever the case, you just need to be honest with yourself and him and move forward!|`|rlUUaSgqaa	As somebody who got laid off myself last year, I have to be honest and admit that you seem pretty selfish.  Getting laid off from a job is one of the toughest things a person can ever have to go through in their lives.  Not only is there the loss of income, but there is a lot of shame as well.  I was really lucky that my husband (fiance at the time) was extremely supportive and made the transition much easier for me.  Even though we weren't married yet, we'd gotten engaged because we already knew we would be there for each other through better or worse, richer or poorer.  It's clear you only want to be with him while things are better and not while they are worse.  After seven years, he deserves a lot more than that.|`|77NzfiVkaa	Just encourage him to get a new job. If he gets one and you still feel this way then you should try to break up with him or take a break. You might just have these feelings because of his unemployment.
HnEcgVGiaa	No, Jesus won't do that to you. Sometimes, it's very difficult to control what you are thinking! I know! I have weird thoughts too! I hate having them and wish I can somehow control what I think, but it's pretty difficult. I know those things are wrong, and I am against what's going on in my head - it's like there's someone else in me, haha.<br>  <br>  Occupying yourself with various tasks will help minimize those kinds of thoughts. Be positive and see the good in things. Trust in God, knowing that He knows how you truly feel and understand that He loves you no matter what. To make you feel better, just ask for forgiveness each time that happens. A simple 'I'm sorry' will do. He will forgive you. <br>  <br>  I'm sure your actions don't reflect these thoughts. So you must be a good person. Be strong in Him and let Him guide you each and every day. Remind yourself that there is a God who is infinitely understanding, compassionate, and loving. He will not punish you just because of the thoughts that you couldn't control. It's sometimes like your dreams. Sometimes, we behave in dreams that we would never think of.<br>  <br>  You know your true self - as someone who is good. Be strong and don't let these thoughts control who you are and how you live your daily life.<br>  <br>  Best,<br>  <br>  Brian|`|odBWpML6aa	Wow, that's head-spinning stuff, what a drag it must be for you!<br>  <br>  The more honest answer to you question is not "No", it is ... stick with me, I am going to help you ... "So what?"<br>  <br>  It may be you are "cursed", but G-d grants what appear to be curses which are always blessings in disguise.  Life is not meant to be simple, rather life is meant to be a challenge -- a every continuing series of challenges specially tailored to YOU, to each of us, as beloved individuals granted this gift of life.<br>  <br>  The real question is "So what" -- not the scoffing, mocking, goth "So what?, it is instead the engaged, curious, seeking "So what now?" -- What are YOU supposed to do?<br>  <br>  If you are only occasionally distracted by such thoughts you will find relief in any activity that takes concentration -- learning to knit, working with toddlers and primary schoolers, working as an aide or nurse at the Hospital.  You probably know best yourself what draws your full attention for extended periods of time.  <br>  <br>  Alternatively the constant positive and social distractions of friends engaged in some active activity -- a sports game, an involved board game, school work, a project also helps cleanse the troubled  mind and retrain it away from run-away run-around negative chains of thought.<br>  <br>  However, it might be that your thoughts of this type are very bothersome and getting worse.  In that case you should, please, see a professional therapist or doctor.  There are specific therapies and drugs that do help people with problems exactly  like you describe, and treating such things early before they become established habits is very helpful.<br>  <br>  * * *<br>  Another answerer mentioned this, and it could be important for you.  Yes, doctors can put you on the wrong drug or the wrong dosage.  If it is that you are already being treated with some drug or drugs for OCD, it might very well be that those drugs are causing these troubled chains-of-thoughts.  I've seen that happen to people.  So talk to your doctor, see a second specialist for a alternative option -- and good doctor will welcome that second opinion.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	This group can help: www.teloscenter.com|`|9x4fssPuaa	First of all we all get all kinds of different thoughts in our heads all the time, yes from the silly G rated ones to the scary or risque R rated ones. This could be a self esteem issue or self confidence issue as well, which is something that is very common.<br>  <br>  Identify what you're good at, tell yourself (on purpose and in your head) over and over how good you are at it and think of all things that brought you there or what else you have that is positive in your life. Take time to do that at least once a day or as many times you want to argue with your "bad thoughts".<br>  <br>  This could also just be anxiety that you  are feeling and perpetuating by talking to yourself negatively. Nothing wrong with replacing negative thoughts with positive ones, in fact that is one way to fix issues like OCD. <br>  <br>  Find things you are good at or love to do and find the time to do them. I knew someone who would journal and when she did think negative thoughts she would argue with herself in some journal entries. Is it crazy? No and I'm sure you're a normal person trying to live in a crazy world.|`|fF9uTSmpaa	jesus. he will not do that... pray and tell him its not yu saying that stuff. cus yu know there could b a demon in yur soul.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	No because Jesus is dead.|`|WDJH7KBEaa	of course not because jesus wouldn't do that|`|ZzPD423paa	Weezy,<br>  <br>  You might need to check your medicines.  Some medicines do this to people, so please consult with your doctor.  Try a new mantra like "Lord help me to be the best person I know how to be every day!"  and "I am beautiful and I know I must be patient."    You can put your own words into your mind and repeat them over and over.  Make them positive though!!  You really are beautiful because all of God's children are precious in his sight according to the Bible.  No one curses you or has power over you but YOU.  Your god wants all good things for you and all you have to do is be yourself.  Relax and be yourself....See what beautiful things happen.|`|Yi5Rgauoaa	No, Jesus is not going to do anything. If he answered every time someone asked him to no one would lose a loved one and everyone would win the lottery.|`|HP0WqWXYaa	If you say you have ocd, isn't it your psychiatrist is the most suitable person to answer your questions?|`|AA11227500	I don't think he would curse you or anything, but next time you notice you've done it ask for his forgiveness. He knows what you are going through. Don't worry!|`|cydakP87aa	no. thats natural i think. <br>  jesus wont do any of that either<br>  its just your brain messing with you a little<br>  probably not a big deal at all|`|oHN6jwjoaa	no.<br>  jesus will never do that.<br>  he is on your side.<br>  so maybe you should try to believe that.|`|7zIAKszxaa	no|`|AFXoB8txaa	NOT AT ALL.... well it just depend on ur religion.. if you know him and the word in the bible u will know that god is not like that remember he made us in his own image and he wouldn't put more on u than u can u handle if u believe that u will know about how to pray for guidance and protection and what ever u need him to help u with. just trust and believe that he will work everything out in time negative thinking is not godly.... anything this is negative is not god ways of life so wut u practice and believe can just be a image of ur life i will definitely keep u in my prayer i belive prayer is a very powerful thing and it has got me a long way just the way i was brought just trust god and he wont fail u there a scripture thats say may not come when u want him but he be there right on time,,,,, take care and GOD BLESS|`|lVIdENvqaa	No, He is not that kind to curse you for every thought you have.<br>  Find something to preoccupy yourself and don't dwell on obsessive thinking. Exercise your mind with a book or a good movie.|`|hsp7f9Epaa	no he is not I have probs to so jesus is on your side I promise|`|JtaWDdWyaa	No, he won't do that. He wants the best for you.

hBWMtBuMaa	what i would do is go up to your mom and ask her "mom. When is dad going to stop smoking?" and if she reacts badly, tell her that you are just concerned for his life. make sure she knows that you are just concerned and that even though you want him to stop, he might now. if your mom understands, ask her if you guys can sit down and talk to him about it. Smoking his one of the hardest addictions to get over...if he decides to stop...make sure he knows that you are supportive..|`|Y9nJxRlpaa	sorry i dont know what to say but to praY AND ASK GOD THE HEAVENLY CREATATOR YOUR PARENTSCREATED YOU, AND EVERYTHING ELSE.|`|AA10464614	look up for somone who like him to gives him the advice<br>  and tell your father we love you , we do not need to loose you . please stopped smoking dad|`|9vccbqrVaa	You should start smoking and see how he likes it.|`|To6cfSwFaa	can't make someone do something they dont want to do sorry|`|2675a5e081f27a4fd16640e07722bd38aa	come on girl let him enjoy his life no one lives forever all of us we died so let him how he likes in his life|`|3ff7fbbf6ec3ee979b59d7290a91816daa	What you shared with us, as far as your feelings and concerns about your father's well being and health, should be discussed with him and the rest of your family.  Try to get everyone involved by having some kind of intervention with your father, showing him how much everyone cares, not just you, about his state of mind, and health!  An addict of whatever sort, cannot continue listening to his own reasoning, so it takes others to intervene and make known the emotional and physical stresses being brought about by the person who is abusing the substance.  Good luck to you and your family.|`|90useHoZaa	Don't do what the others told you to do "to start smoking and see how your dad likes it" don't do that. be honest and say what you feel i know its gonna be hard.

My dad smoked everyday since I was born and about 1 year ago he had  2 heart attacks. That was a huge eye opener for him, me and my family. Luckily he lived and had decided that he needs to stop. However my family and I have always wanted him to stop smoking and he never did. He has to have the mind set to stop or he never will. Just be honest with him that's all you can do. Good Luck|`|11a867519828ee7f2df6eda7cb34fb8faa	You can't force people to do your will in life.  Just live and let live.  And remember, we all deserve our little vices.  It helps us get thru life.  He knows smoking causes cancer, and he doesn't care so why should you get all worked up about it.|`|D6qa0yC3aa	Smoking is his choice.<br>  You have to realize this.<br>  If he wants to smoke you can't stop him.<br>  Its also good too realize it is very very hard to quit, and that when people are told to not smoke when they are addicted it is very easy for them to get  mad.<br>  The best thing for you do is probably not worry about it, and if  you decide  to say  something, which its  usually best you don't, be very kind and polite.|`|jwftwLBTaa	Thats a hard situation and I feel for you. I think you need to wait till he is in a good mood and quietly sit down with him and tell him how you feel, without being accusatory, or demanding. Enlist your Moms help. Your Dad knows that it is bad for him, not only because he is a nurse, but he is an adult and he knows. I felt the same way as you once. It will take a lot of courage, but you can be saving his life!|`|Wo4Gxtduaa	well....this may be hard but see if you can have the tie to speak to him. then tell him how you feel. hes your father he should listen to what you have to say. ask him nicely "dad why do you smoke". questions like that. make him know  that it concerns you when he smokes.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck ^_^|`|d1TTwwUUaa	I'm 53 and believe me smoking addiction IS the hardest thing to quit. Someone can't just tell you to stop. Really the more you tell stop the more they are going to smoke. Dads probably been smoking for such a long time. Just tell him again calmly how you feel about him smoking and your concerns. Sit on his lap and give him some big hugs. Remind him how much you love him and care. But honestly he's going to quit when he himself wants to if ever. Sorry but that is how it is. I've been trying to quit forever it seems and have tried everything to do it. And when it comes down to it I quess I really don't want to.
MWjNp6y3aa	Definitely the most funny question ever. Especially the body of the question. Wonderful stuff  dude.

Try not to worry about finding a man right now. It will come. It's better if you find someone while you're doing your own thing. You'll have more in common and have a higher success rate. You're not old. I hate to break it to you. Go out and have fun. Learn how to do something new. Enjoy your own company. Boost that confidence of yours. It's ok if you're not married, have kids, and have your own home. There's more to life than that. The one thing everyone wants is happiness. Many people have all that but are still miserable. Find peace and happiness with yourself first. I promise, after you do that, you will get exactly what you need. It sounds like you have a pattern of bad relationships. The reason I'm pressuring you to find your own happiness is because it will break that pattern. I was the same way. I gained self-worth and independence, and met my husband not long after. He is so different from anyone I've ever known. He has a positive influence on me. I feel like I can accomplish anything. He is nothing short of perfect for me. I discovered who I was first. Once I knew myself, I knew exactly what I wanted and needed, and he came. Best of luck to you!|`|PHYj1UPwaa	I think at this point in your life..you really need a break from men and relationships..You need to do something positive..just for you...Take a class and better your education..find a field that interests you..how about Nursing...you can always find a job..a good job and you will be helping people and you can work just about anywhere in the world..Take up an ART class..Learn a new Dance....Read a book..Just do something that will enrich your life and make you feel better about yourself...Stop focusing your life and grading your life by th men in your life..There is a great big world out there just waiting for you to bring your talents and gifts to so many people that really need you...Good Luck...(I love sewing....Me and my sewing machine just hum right along)  Good Luck..SMILE|`|eoQoCcz5aa	Try a different approach maybe your local church ?  , there you will find a better class of chap unlike the cretins you have been involved with so far , how about a singles club  ? , or reading a lonely hearts ad in your local paper but do be careful when trying this way .

Most girls usually wait till your age to decide that being with jerks isn't the way to go. I honestly feel bad for you, and feel as though you shouldn't be focused on finding love.

But before you do anything, I suggest reading the book, "He's Just Not That Into You" by Greg Behrendt.  This book is very smart, and helped me.  I used to have the SAME exact problem.  The bad controlling relationships, boys that hit me, did drugs and I oh-so-loved-them.  But after i read that book, things changed for me and I haven't been with a REAL d-head since.  Now, that's not to say that they all aren't d-heads from time to time, but let's just say that things have defitinely changed in the aspect that the men I have met since the book respect and cater to me like it should be.
jPJ9MTCwaa	I think it is somewhat the same for all the diocess.  First off, the priests are people and often very approachable people at that.  Of course you will be nervous but just remember they want to help you through this process and want the best for you and your relationship.  <br>  <br>  For us, we had to do a number of things.  First we had to do the marriage classes.  We had to go to 6 concerning things like finances, family development, the sacrament of marriage, sexuality, conversational skills, and something else I can't remember!  :-)  it is somewhat daunting because there are other people there but you are not forced to share if you don't want to.  A lot of the class is talking with your FH about issues such as what you will be doing for holidays, how will you handle and share responsibilities around the house and concerning money matters, good ways to communicate, etc.  The sexuality one, fyi, was all between couples for us and addressed current and future sexual issues.  At no time did the preist ever ask about or bring up our sex life or lack thereof one way or another.   <br>  <br>   Next, we needed to go to an engagement encounter.  These are all over the country.  <a href="http://www.engagedencounter.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.engagedencounter.org/</a>  We are actually going on ours in three weeks.  From what I have heard, it is a weekend of reflection on your relationship with your FH and issues that may come up in marriage.  A lot of writing and discussion but important things to think about before getting married.  <br>  <br>  As for meeting with the priest, there are a couple of those.  There are a number of things the priest needs from you.  You will need to get a noted baptism certificate from the church in which you were baptized.  He'll ask you questions for a form (very easy questions like what your name is, how long you two have known eachother, if you are a practicing Catholic, your birthday, wedding date, if you've ever been married before or have children, nothing horrible, I promise!).  At some point you will have to get a parent or close family member/friend to vouche for you that you haven't been married before, you don't have children from a prior relationship, and if you do that you are taking care of your obligations to them.  At some point they made us fill out a questionare that we need to go over with the priest just to talk about areas we may disagree on and should take note of for the future.  Eventually, you'll talk about the ceremony in general.  There are criteria that must be met concerning times and readings that will need to be addressed.  <br>  <br>  It's kind of awkward at first and scary but they are just trying to ensure that the relationship has a great foundation from the get go and help in your special day!!  you'll do amazingly.|`|hkwBR1moaa	When we met with the priest he asked us questions about ourselves to make sure our answers were compatible.  If there was an issue that we didn't agree on, he basically couseled us on how to handle the disagreements.  In no way was he judging us, he was just making sure we were prepared for married life.  Then he makes you take a  questionaire seperatly and privatly and see how our answers match up.  It's not as bad as some would make you think.  They just take marriage seriously and want to make sure you are too.  They don't want someone to make a huge commitment and then 2 years down the line have them say, "well I didn't know you wanted to spank our kids, I firmly believe in not spanking" or something like that and then get divorced.  So don't be nervous, but be honest.  I believe we met with the priest twice and went to one day for the engaged class.  That was it!|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	You're in for instruction. You probably won't have to talk to anybody -- just sit and listen, take notes. The classes are run according to the talent/ability of the instructor, so really, no two are exactly alike.|`|884v4VhGaa	Pre-Cana is nothing that you wouldn't get in any normal premarital counselling, except for some extra religious and doctrinal bits. They tend to push NFP, obviously, but everyone there understand that most people use other methods of birth control. <br>  <br>  It's mostly about communication skills, family systems, etc (I'm not repeating all of it when it's all been listed so well already). The reason for this is to save you money so that you can get your premarital counselling for $150 instead of paying that per hour with a private counsellor.
lgxE5nUoaa	It doesn't matter because it's already said and done - you were trying to be the better person and that has merit.  <br>  <br>  Just move on now and don't contact him again.

He can't help it but he is being a jerk so move on.  <br>  <br>  Casual relationships should NEVER involve sex because sex is not casual.  Allowing another person to be inside of you is never casual no matter what other people on this site might claim!<br>  <br>  This guy is confused and without trying to he is using you to get over his ex.  You are rebound girl.<br>  <br>  Unless someone loves you they are not willing to committ and sex without commitment is empty.<br>  <br>  You are a scary person because you want more than he can give right now.<br>  <br>  If you want more stop having casual sex.|`|rTF9Wjp9aa	well ... am I missing something... you said you were dating him casually... as far as I am concered you didnt have a commited relationship, and therefore it shouldnt matter ... any of it..<br>  <br>  I mean i think you handle the name calling in bed nicely...and responding to his text was the best way to go .. you are just being your laid back self(as it seems to me) which is good..... <br>  <br>  <br>  but I have friends that  are aquaintances that will not answer texts until the following week...or not at all....<br>  <br>  if you think he isnt worth it another date, why does it all matter?... and why is he a jerk, he sounds like he is going through his own **** right now, just let him be .. and do as you have respond when he does come around, if you like him enough to be his friend.. then be his friend...|`|jdRKZe18aa	I think if you think the term "JERK" applies to him in ANY WAY shape or form - then you should opt out of this relationship before you get INTO it with him further.  Don't settle for jerk when there ARE good guys out there if you LOOK hard enough.
FXCoGD44aa	Oh my gosh! I am in the EXACT same situation as you - I can't believe it. It's my brother-in-law's wife that is completely rude, dramatic and obnoxious, and everyone has a serious problem with her... but BIL is just oblivious. She says absolutely anything she wants without any regards to people's feelings or common decency. I TOTALLY understand your frustration... especially with the kid situation, and the close-knit family!!!<br>  <br>  Everyone in my husband's family has been telling me to just "keep the peace" and not rock the boat for the sake of harmony. They have the same attitude that you mentioned - just let it go. But it is SO hard. I have been looking for ways to deal with her forever... I still haven't found one that really truly works. It sucks because it kind of ruins some family get-togethers when she is there that I would otherwise really enjoy.<br>  <br>  One time, right in the middle of a pretty large family function, I blew up at her cuz I just couldn't keep my lid on any longer... I stood up and actually said, "WTF is your problem b*tch!" and layed into her hard. As good as it felt right then to actually say it, it didn't make a difference in the world. It just started a big fuss with everyone and her behavior thereafter still remained the same. I felt so bad because my mother-in-law actually started crying because she got so upset. So it really wasn't the best idea.<br>  <br>  I've actually confronted her several times, on several different occasions and tried all sorts of "techniques." She just plain doesn't get it. She's one of those people that thinks a quick "sorry" fixes everything, then continues to do it over and over again. What I've been doing is just tolerating her the best I can. I am civil to her when she is around, and nothing more. I have accepted that she is the way she is, she's always going to be rude and inconsiderate, and there is absolutely nothing I can do to change that. I'm okay with her making a total *** out of herself around the family while I sit in the background, chuckling to myself knowing that everyone else is thinking the same thing I am. I generally just ignore her as much as I can... I only talk to her only when absolutely necessary. I try my hardest not to let her see me angry anymore... because she is a button-pusher.<br>  <br>  I hope that my experience with that helps you!<br>  <br>  If you wanna be pen pals about this issue, I'd be more than happy to! I never thought I'd find someone in literally the SAME situation! Maybe together, since it sounds like we are dealing with the same person, we can come up with a solution that actually works.|`|AA11415946	This is what I would do....First, you must control your temper and not let this person have that much control over your emotions.  Remember to ACT not REACT, to her.  Second, you can be in control of the situation by planning a dinner WITH your husband's input that way he is aware (hence the need for his input) when she/they doesn't bring what you asked her/them to bring.  I would just ask the other couples what you would like them to bring there is nothing wrong with asking.  Like, we are supplying the meat, you guys bring the sides and any drinks you would like to drink.  Third, if you don't feel comfortable asking them what to bring you could do this instead: make them accountable by saying this,'so you guys don't duplicate stuff I will call you on such and such day and tell me what you plan to bring'.  And don't you go making anything to make up for it or order anything.  You will have to eat and drink just what is there.  Fourth, if everyone else just brushes off wat she does they prize peace above all else.  However, if you want to make someone accountable it takes planning.  And if you leave the list out like on a fridge or something everyone else will see who didn't bring what.   This will all have to be done very non-chalantly, with no malace.  Just for organizational purposes you see. <br>  ;-)<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are really stressed over this.  I don't want to sound trite but you know that old saying, about the forest and the trees?  Well, I heard a little twist to it.  It's this: When you can't see the forest for the trees, it's time to chop some m...f... trees down!  So...that's why I suggested instead of calling it a dinner party, maybe in order to save your sanity from this person that has no clue, change it in your own head from a "dinner party" to calling it a family pot luck.   There is nothing wrong with asking family members to bring stuff, that's the norm out here in the west.  All the people I know have way too much large families to overburden the hostess.  So people are used to doing things that way. By the way, I'm one of those who is an "asker" not only about food but I jump in the kitchen for cleanup.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't say anything to her....I feel for yah.  Keep biting your tongue.  I applaud you for that.  You don't want to give her the satisfaction of making it easy for her to turn you into the 'bad guy.'<br>  I hear yah on the temper thing, I'm living with a Sicilian/Scottish temper.  People would be laid out on the ground if I let them piss me off. lol.|`|CXOAWDxHaa	I say lay into her next time. She deserves it.|`|0a0d9e39f830aa50f51dc7fbaf228a71aa	The best way is to just tell them straight up.<br>  If they're doing it, it must be on purpose.|`|RQpasDZaaa	It seems that you may actually have to use a little strategy when dealing with her.  It seems she's what we call a pot stirrer.  Which is someone who enjoys stirring the pot, only to see what may come to the surface.  This is why laying into her, will not achieve your desired result.  She will enjoy what's been brought to the surface, and watch it sink, only to stir the pot again.  Get what I'm saying?  What's good is that you're not alone in your feelings for her.  So take the upper hand and set an example for everyone else who's brushing off this rude behavior.  <br>  <br>  The first thing you should do is.., Do Not let her see you angry anymore!  Especially about something she did.  Try not to get angry (at all) around her, since she'd have a better Idea of what pushes your buttons. <br>  <br>  The second is call her out on her behavior.  This must be done in a civil way.  This isn't to show your hostility towards her, just that she and anyone around pays attention to what they can expect from her.  If done right, you'll always walk away with a inner smile, and she'll feel like the azz she's being. Example...  don't hesitate to bring up the nude picture sending, at an opportune time(like in a group).  <br>  <br>  I sense your frustration, and wish you the best of luck.  Remember to strategize and don't get angry.

Maybe take her w/ u if she doesnt mind ur stupidity! If my husband were to tell me that, I would take my daughter and walk out of the house.  Marriages arent based on looks.

Think about that?|`|vBcZZRx5aa	As a woman, if you were my husband I would be so upset.  You need to love her for who she is and not her weight.  You have the same syndrome that a lot of men have with taking your work home.  Your wife is your wife she is not a client of yours.  Its like psychiatrists trying to diagnose their spouses etc.  And I think it is really mean that you say she only works 30 hours a week. She had kids to take care of and if you think she is unworthy of being with you then you need to go date a supermodel.  If you tell her she needs to hit the gym you deserve all the yelling and repercussions you get after that.

If you lost it, tell him that it was his fault for not paying you enough attention. There. That's it! Good Luck!|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Not good. No real easy way but the longer you wait the harder its going to be so you can always send him a postcard from the land down under or the moon, and then pray for the best.

It is just our nature to do that! When you get a hair cut of say something it makes you have a much different perspective of that person|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Well, it seems that you are very shallow and judgemental.  If you like the person for who he is, then that's all it matters.|`|AA10986891	Yes you are, it is because you are really immature I can tell by the way you posted the details.|`|6PhSENcXaa	Yes you are. Turn the table around how would you like if people did that to you?  think about it!|`|4KU3dU5iaa	ur just picky...|`|MYO2k9EUaa	I think you are being really judgmental, but that's just what personality you were born with, I'm sure. <br>  <br>  That sometimes happens to me, however, I don't notice if its something the person did or said, but I automatically don't like them anymore.|`|om4uztzxaa	NO one is like u. personally i think that is very bad. But then again it depends on what they say. u should have told us what he said and that wold help us know if you were being wrong. but it sounds okay i guess. I think u r just confussed on what u r truely interseted in right now.|`|kOoCya9Oaa	I think " judgmental " is butting it lightly.|`|D9AUzmZRaa	Yes, it sounds like you are very shallow.<br>  <br>  Is the guy NICE?

If you really like that guy, you shouldn't be turned off only because of a haircut.|`|vQ54vYFTaa	i have a tendency to be the same way.  i can be very in to someone and want nothing more to be with them, then they do or say something that causes me to turn on them instantly.<br>  over the years, i've come to realize that i do this because i'm concerned about how these seemingly unimportant things are going to be seen as a reflection of ME to others.  <br>  i think its difficult at times to admit we care what people think of us, so we try to repackage our insecurities in other ways.<br>  now, as for how to stop doing this, i have no idea!  :)|`|W0ZsuxRTaa	maybe you've got the judgey pants, but who cares? i mean if it bugs you, then it bugs you, and you can't help it. you don't want to go for a guy that irritates you, even if it's in small ways.|`|9llyTp1zaa	You may just be picky, little perfectionist or something? <br>  <br>  Similar?  The first time I meet a person, I know whether or not if I will like them later.  It's odd, but I've made a ton of great friends.|`|HtAXbr2Taa	Maybe just alittle judgmental. Sorry I dont mean to be rude just saying.|`|s53dSt7Kaa	it mite be that you didn't really like him that much deep down and you're looking for an excuse to stop altogether<br>  <br>  then again, you mite just b unbelievably shallow
yN8vmGSnaa	I'm usually the first one to say don't put yourself up for a second disappointment and I don't condone cheating but their are occasionally circumstances etc. First I think you need to talk to your bf. Larry sounds reliable but just in case he's lying or making a bad joke take to your bf before anything else. If you bf denies and think Larry is telling the truth lose the boy and move forward. If your bf admits it and isn't regretful lose him and move forward. If your bf admits it and is regretful and you believe he is sincere talk about maybe giving him a second chance. Only when the man is regretful and honestly wants to move forward past his mistake and truly change can you think about giving him a second chance. Otherwise, no he doesn't deserve it.|`|MtsfAnXVaa	my experience, once a cheater always a cheater.|`|MuVKeK8faa	Move.On.|`|7NtMbVCJaa	e-ne meenie miney mo......<br>  <br>  outcome says no!|`|whYPpRXRaa	Chop off his pingas and call it even|`|p7l8aKQ7aa	No No No NEVER!!!!!!!!  never ever ever give a boy a second chance if hes a cheat. hes a scumbagggggggggggg!!!!!!!!!!!!!! kick him in the balls smash his face in and get rid!|`|kE3XWYpxaa	The real question is how much do you love the person he is.<br>  And also could you see yourself being with him for the rest of your life. <br>  You're hitting that stage now where you must be thinking about kids, marriage, etc. Is he really 100% the one you want to do it with? And if he has cheated on you before, he could do it again...once a cheater, always a cheater. So do you really want to be with him? If so give him another chance at your own risk of him potentially breaking your heart. And also all the accusations you will probably make which will ultimately throw you off track anyway...And if you dont love him and cant see yourself with him for the rest of your life then break up with him.|`|yoS4cAszaa	People don't normally change. Especially if he was bragging about the girls he cheated on you with. Do you really want to look like a fool by getting back with him after all he has done? Most likely he would do it again.|`|z4iETkpsaa	Did you ask him why he cheated in the first place? I would get all the info I could. Communicate till there is nothing left to talk about..  get it all out in the open. <br>  <br>  Once there is nothing left in the dark and the vulnerability and honesty is there, it's up to you to make the decision of whether or not the good "out weighs" the bad. <br>  <br>  If during this time you two are communicating, he gets defensive and puts the blame on you for not being there for him,  or spending too much time at work, blah blah blah..  forget him/ move on, he will never change.<br>  <br>  But if, and this is a big if, mind you..  if he is willing to focus 100% on you and be loyal and honest, compassionate, understanding, and not give in to temptations, and you can put this behind you and move forward, then it ( relationship) may be capable of being saved. It all depends on whether or not you're willing to do the hard work. You CAN NOT bring it up and use it against him in future arguments, that's a big " no no" and therapists will tell you the same ( saving you 70 bucks here a session, lol)  If you don't think you are  strong enough to move on 100 % and never bring up the past, then it will not work. For how can two people have a future together when the present is being destroyed with bringing up a negative past? <br>  <br>  Personally, I'm with one of the other answerers..  and would leave his *** and find someone else who respects you more and would never think to cheat on you, why go through all that hard work with no guarantee that he wont do it again?|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Nope - once a person has cheated, they tend to do it again.  I would end the relationship immediately and never look back.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	This is "marriage and divorce"..........no one here gives a rats azz about your nine month shack up situation........|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Forgiving a cheater just reinforces the belief that you'll forgive NEXT time.<br>  Absolutely no second chances. Cheaters don't love or respect you. Dump them.|`|b26NgqOFaa	you are young and unattached. move on and find someone else. this is crap.|`|AueAwhQeaa	You were correct, that was a long one.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	You moved in together last week so presumably you have not unpacked completely, thats a good thing.<br>  Move out and go back where you were before, this guy is a cheater and you wont ever trust him again, you cant even trust him now and you have only lived together a week !!!<br>  What does that tell you ? Be strong, be smart and be independent.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	sorry but Cheaters DOESN'T deserve a second chance.|`|0UUDFxR0aa	Give him enough rope and he will hang himself|`|sCCjAKllaa	It depends on the circumstances of it. But for the most part, no.|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	Wow that is quite the situation and if I were in the situation since you are not living together as of yet I would just leave the relationship and move on. I mean he has cheated once and yes he has changed but he was saying 2 months ago he was sleeping with so and so. I do not think your friend is lying to you. I think that he has cheated more then the one time. I think he does not deserve you and you should just end things before they get worse and you are living together and makes things more difficult!|`|9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	The fact that you are running this question through your mind tells me that YOU think that your boyfriend has the ability to cheat on you. <br>  <br>  If you feel like he has the ability (reputation or not) to cheat on you I would not make any permenant commitment.  It's not fair to you and him. <br>  <br>  I say him because I don't believe , once a cheater is always a cheater. I believe it's circumstantial. People grow and change over time and if was a cheater a few years back it could easily be because he was immature back then. <br>  <br>  HOWEVER<br>  <br>  It all depends on you.  I believe any relationship deserves to be a clean slate and past mistakes made with other people should not haunt the person in another relationship as long as it's not a habitual problem with that person. <br>  <br>  If you want this relationship to work you will need to be open and honest. Talk to him about what your friend told you and ask about it.  I know this will cause problems between him and his friend but you owe it to your boyfriend to give him the chance to defend himself otherwise you are going to be wondering about it.|`|Bf8PVFSSaa	The "need" one. But shouldnt get one.<br>  <br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|fQYU96euaa	No, cheaters dont deserve a second chance...ever, male or female if you cheat, you're a loser period, there is no excuse for cheating other then they are too big of cowards to do the right thing.|`|vXFpzKRaaa	Everyone can change but they have to show that they've changed before I can slowly trust them again.  That being said, I rarely ever give cheaters a second chance.  I've always believed that if you let them hurt you a second time, then it's your own fault so I don't put myself in that position.    If I were you, I wouldn't go anywhere near him.  He seems like he's not mature enough to handle a real relationship just yet.  Let him have his fun and you shouldn't wait for him.  Go out and find yourself a good man that'll treat you right.

Or maybe they're trying to plan some more romantic encounters at home on the weekends.<br>  <br>  When you've been married a long time, it's hard to make time or to have the energy to be romantic with one another.  You sort of have to "make" the magic happen when it used to come naturally.  Good for your parents for trying to make it work.<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much.  If they were splitting up, they would come to you about it.  It's more likely that they're just wanting to try something new in their marriage.|`|3ff7fbbf6ec3ee979b59d7290a91816daa	Perhaps what you over heard was them talking about getting away for a weekend to renew their love life.  Sometimes couples need to get away for a period of time from everyone and everything.  Changing up the scene may be the best thing to help them get a fresh start, or some privacy for their intimate affair.  Talk and suggest to them something on this line and perhaps they will consider this as part of their recovery for their marriage.  Good luck to you all.|`|fNgv2FeRaa	Well dear you prove yourself to be a mature young adult by just asking them..they are treating you like a child by not including you.|`|5dRvtaGgaa	Maybe they wanted to get away for a romantic weekend?  Don't get upset before you know what's going on.|`|r2f9N1BLaa	If i were you, I'd ask them - not in a nosey kind of way, but politely|`|dgCWS01baa	The best thing is to ask them. If they were spliting up im sure they would have told you by now. My parents split up when i was four and i know it can be tough. The only way i delt with my parents divorce is prayer. I believe God has a reason for everything and the tough things he puts us through prepares us for greater things in the future.  I have been through ALOT even though im only 15 and i know that its all going to be worth it because one day ill be able to help people who are going through the same things i went through. I hope that your parents are staying together cause divorce is a terrible thing. <br>  But if it does happen and you need someone to talk to my email is bigeyedtreefrog@yahoo.com|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Don't be afraid, it sounds like they are making arrangements in an amicable manner, which means you won't be used as a pawn. You'll still be a family of sorts, but in different houses. They will both still love you, their relationship is entered into a friendship phase, and I think that this is great, they are both very lucky, in that they can both be very mature about it, and considerate of your feelings. It sounds like they are both level-headed people who will sort things out to everyone's satisfaction. So even if they do split up, it will be fine.|`|FmhUZLgoaa	My parent's split up when I was about 17 or 18 and to honest they weren't happy and that made me unhappy. It was a relief that they were finally split and happy. It was hard at first to deal with everything but in the end it was the best thing that could have happened to all of us because we are all happier now. It will be hard at first but you will learn to deal with everything. Just make sure that when they finally talk to you about it you tell them you want to stay out of the divorce part and you don't want to hear the bad stuff. Good Luck I know it's hard at first but it will get better.|`|qjDxKXENaa	maybe they meant weekend away to sort their relationship!!! you can ask either of them what is happening and it is upsetting you. they wouldnt want you to be sad or upset... they are there for your happiness.|`|f4krIbjeaa	My parents split up when i was 1, so i really didn't have to deal with it.|`|zLKsBm1Uaa	Just keep in mind that it was no fault of yours if they should decide to split up.|`|sKmpVHZZaa	sound like they are going away together for the weekend...dont worry..be open with them and ask them..if they are they will both still love you..im fostered an i just got over it..dnt worry =]
3FRy850uaa	yeah, like you said fighting with your parents is kind of normal, just do what you're doing and stay in your room for as long as you can and try to pay no mind to your step dad or mother if she keeps yelling. Just stay there and try to focus on some other thoughts. And the fact that you broke down today when u usually dont is kind of normal, sometimes subconciously you're so tired of the same crap that you end up breaking down at the most random moments. But as long as you're not being abused and nothing major happened, try to relax or being get out for a little if you can. HOPE I HELPED! :)|`|lN9jcKYhaa	scissors|`|KDst9z5Naa	I am sorry to hear that . It is important to try to learn to cope with stress and difficult people. You might want to write out what bothers you and what you would like to do to fix it and give it to your parents when everyone is calm.You can also try to talk to them on wanting the house to be calmer and what steps the parents need to do to make it a reality.I hope things work out for you !|`|VkzmH1GKaa	You need to talk to some one, maybe a school counselor, person from church, parent of a friend or a counsling helpline in your area, check the web.

Don't interact with your parents for a while, and if you need any help with anything else just email me.|`|SO4xR0rxaa	if you get desperate you might think this is a load of rubbish but call childline
iPNOVR6Gaa	I'm 46, married for 22 years, am able to have sex with my wife almost as often as I want to, and I still masturbate and watch porn.  There's nothing wrong with it.|`|POHWTDPRaa	It's not likely that he doesn't still have his quality alone time. He has no reason to lie about it. It's something that 'everyone' does whether they are in a relationship or not. He's probably watching porn too. Again, most people do at least every once in a while. So you need to talk to him about it. Because he is lying and that's a problem. If he won't be truthful about something so insignificant, what other kind of stories is he feeding you?|`|aDIPIu7xaa	You know, I never spelled this $hitty at 20 years old.....I just turned 34, so my age isn't THAT much off here....why can't you younger people spell?  I mean, seriously!|`|77NzfiVkaa	Why do you care if he masturbates to porn? Or if he masturbates at all? As long as he is faithful to you it doesn't really matter. And if he is telling you he doesn't then just believe him because it's really not a big deal.|`|8SKpsVG7aa	yes we all do and theres nothing you can do about it|`|FXCoGD44aa	It's completely believable that a guy his age doesn't watch porn anymore. My boyfriend is 25 and I know for a FACT that he doesn't [[I live with him and we share a computer!]]. If a guy is generally satisfied, then he doesn't usually go for porn.<br>  <br>  The pops-up could legitimately be a virus. That happened to my computer once when I went on a website that was completely unrelated. <br>  <br>  I'd say chill out and just believe him. It's not like it's a big deal anyway.|`|ygimTNzoaa	It's very possible he doesn't masturbate to porn, but less likely if you don't live with him. If you don't live with him there's those random times he may want to "get off" I believe he'd be looking at porn for it, unless you both took your own sex porn pictures, then he has the ones of you! And a guy who is in love with you, I've heard that's enough. I've been in 2 serious relationships though, my first I was 18 he was 19 it lasted 5 years and the day we'd met he moved in with me. The second I'm in now we met September 16th 2008 and I moved in with him 2 weeks later. So, I don't know so much about non live-in relationships. But if I wasn't living with my man, I wouldn't hold it against him so much, I would if I live with him, and I have confronted both men in the relationships, and they both agreed to stop and had/have. Since I'm living with him, I initiate it because I LOVE sex, and they're just depriving me, it's understandable yes?|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Guys watch porn - guys get themselves off - get used to it - it isn't going to change...they more you witch about it - the more secretive they'll be about it...<br>  <br>  It has nothing to do with you - they are visual creatures and that's how they get the job done.  It's not about love or lust - it's just about releasing the morning pressure...|`|gjaPNWbTaa	If he is a straight male with testicles and is between the age of 18 and 100 and has internet access, he watches porn.|`|sU3y1CrIaa	i think he is lying.  I dont know any men who dont masturbate.  trust me they dont grow out of it|`|rjsB4oDkaa	i dont thinks so, he sound sweet and innocent i would believe him.|`|akHYRh5Raa	GET OVER IT<br>  EVERY BOY DOES NO MATTER WHAT AGE!!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	my man does and i dont care.|`|dprURFLxaa	No matter how old they get, they all masturbate and they all watch porn.  Who cares?  Not me. ★|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	Its hard to say whether he does or doesn't just truthfully explain to him your concern and tell him that what you want is honesty. It is very believable that he doesn't watch porn or masturbate. My husband and I are both the same way anything we do is mutual its just no fun to go off and do those things alone when you have the person you love to do them with you.|`|7SwfRs4Uaa	It is believable My boyfriend was never into it, and still isn't. I understand that it is because he used to be into it, that NOW you're finding it hard to believe that he is completely not into it anymore. He did mention this to you on his own accord, which I think is a sign he isn't lying. Why mention it just to mention it if you never had an issue with it?|`|f4RnGIeSaa	It actually is possible for him to have grown out of masturbation and porn if he is getting enough stimulation from you.  Many men continue until the day they die, but not all.<br>  <br>  Regardless, I think you shouldn't be concerned one way or the other about his practices.  It doesn't hurt your relationship and it doesn't truly matter.<br>  <br>  Have fun and stop trying to create a problem where there isn't one.|`|L2lRZMbOaa	He must watch porn because you seem like a prudish ugly chick. Perhaps if you did some exercises or got a gym membership, get rid of some of your excess weight and then got some medicine for your acne. You disgust me you ugly troll.|`|SToOdHj1aa	He's lying, me, you, him, we all do it.  He probably watches porn, too.  But he wants to keep this part of his life private, which is understandable (who wants their girl to think they are spanking it?).  I say just leave it be.|`|B1MnNcI8aa	If I were you, I'd write in shorter paragraphs.  <br>  He's a male, is alive, has a working penis.  You do the math.|`|rTN6JpZtaa	if you really are 20 then you should be ashamed of the way you spell.|`|H0vicK8Kaa	yes! it's possisble.. Now you're there to fulfill his needs why would he go solo!!.<br>  ARE You still masturbating?..|`|3wjHz0Bmaa	my god learn how to spell|`|6ApIp7Ryaa	So you think that all guys masturbate and watch porn, so if he tells you he doesn't then he must be lying?<br>  <br>  You have been going out with him for six years, you should be able to know if you trust him enough to believe him when he tells you something, no matter what it is.<br>  <br>  Some guys have a lower drive. You may have a higher sex drive than him.<br>  Don't make an issue where there isn't one.|`|B7kPUmUWaa	I'm not a guy, but I don't think they grow out of it! I know my husband didn't! Neither did I! It's a natural part of life. Why would you want to grow out of it? And as for the porn, unless it bothers you, why not watch it together? Then you have solved your problem! If you don't want to watch it, just have a conversation with him about it and make it clear to him what's ok and what's not.
17d0eca96aa4c9dc2a5df4922583bc31aa	I wish I knew!!! I mean even if you come out and ask them half the time they dont know what to say. If you ever figure this one out let me know!!

You are a girl, so you should know.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	Most of the time they aren't sending mixed signals we're just misreading them.  Best to take a man at face value and believe that what he says or does is what he means.  Don't read into it or try to analyze it and look for a hidden meaning.|`|FxpE8ivMaa	You have it backwards for the most part, girls can never make up their minds. but maybe he doesn't like you as much as you think? or maybe he's just nervous.|`|fC8OPOTkaa	us girls do it too.|`|OoNeyVAoaa	guys are shy..thats what makes them cute..remember the A TRUE MAN DOESNT SHOW EMOTIONS rule they been raised with..they will not show their feelings..they send mixed signals because they want to tell you how they feel but at the same time they dont want you to know how they feel for example if one day hes all nice and cute and the best guy ever the  next day hes acting like ur just a friend the next day hes jealous because he seen you talking to a guy and so on..if he doesnt make up his mind and and keeps sending all these mixed signals talk to him about it and lay your cards on the table.. good luck hun!|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Mixed signals can mean mixed feelings. He's either not sure about his feelings for you or he's sending mixed signals because you're sending mixed signals. You confuse him and he doesn't know what's going on, so he sends mixed signals. Try to be clear and maybe tell him how you feel about him.|`|iqh2iDknaa	Errr...usually its the woman who does this kind of thing. I think guys do it because they are unsure of whether the person they like likes them and they are afraid to push it.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	maybe he has given you a steady signal and you are over thinking the situation<br>  <br>  ask him straight up<br>  and stop acting like a drama queen!|`|KHhqmo4Oaa	Nope, guys are empty headed.

6BSHkiugaa	Watch out!!  this sitution sounds like my 17 yr marriage that I am still unhappily in.  My mother in law put me down because I worked in a club and had a son to a previous marriage.  She even went as far as to remove my son from an Easter picture because she stated she only wanted the Grand kids. She too is obsessed with people with money as though values and feeling dont count.  If your spouse is not putting you first you will end up unhappy too.  The Bible states the spouse is too leave and cleave to his spouse.  Do not tolerate this or it will get worse.  Demnd respect!!!!!|`|ENSGrZAqaa	If you like being treated like ****, then sure, things are looking up.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Do you live with your in-laws?  If not, why do you care what they think?

This is an objective comment.  Notice every aspect of "Love" is relative to how it makes "Me" feel.  The greater self appreciation exist the more "Love" there is to share.

oHYOli4Gaa	As a Chinese, 2 children are always consider  "NOT ENOUGH". Chinese always want a big family. In Singapore, Government is encourage people to give more birth, incentives are given to 2nd, 3rd and 4th. children.<br>  <br>  Frankly speaking, in my family, "one is too little, 2 is just okay." A lot of Chinese here love to give 2 children, one BOY one GIRL. The boy helps the mum and the girl helps the dad when growing  up in the future.<br>  <br>  I think it is alright that you should give birth to another child, hopefully is a girl, so that a Chinese Character "hao" is form in the family which means a "good" is in the family. You should think about it. You are short a lovely girl in the family. Children are our love.<br>  <br>  The age gap of the children is not a problem. I have a lot for friends that their brothers and sisters age are far apart. Even 10 years different.<br>  <br>  Career and slim down are much easier to catch up. Once a woman above 35, it is hard to give birth. <br>  <br>  Your husband of course loves the 2 children that you give to him. Frankly speaking, as a father, mostly love girl children more which I experienced it around my friends and family, of course he will take care of the younger sibling. <br>  <br>  Once more thing here, please let your husband know it is not good to compare you with his nephew wife. It is not fair to you. Comparison of people are not very good, it can spoilt the relationship amongst you all.

You want what you want, and you guys agreed on the number of children up front. Yes, it's great for kids to have siblings, but it's not some mandatory thing. A lot of factors contribute to the child's happiness, it's not only about having a sibling.

With that attitude, you probably shouldn't even have had the first one.|`|qsLhVZd8aa	The reasons you don't want another child are definitely selfish, but that's not the issue here.  The issue is you do not want another child.  When it comes to decisions like this, the NO always wins.|`|OBCvewW2aa	The fact that you don't want to have another child isn't selfish.  Your reasoning, however, is.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	I'm sorry to say but you do sound selfish. .Just because she doesn't care about how she looks after two kids doesn't mean you wouldn't either.<br>  <br>  Stop comparing your lives to theirs.. you guys are not them!|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Lol there is 17 years between my son and daughter, new husband new sperm.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	No, you are not wrong. Your husband has no business calling you selfish, having a baby is huge. You finally got your life back on track and just because he wants another one that makes you the selfish one? No, I don't think so. You two already agreed on one child and your son will never know the difference between having a sibling or not so why is he using your child as collateral damage? Don't have another child if you don't want one, that's probably the worst thing that two people could do. You just remind your husband that it has taken years to get back on track and not wanting your first child to be lonely is not a good reason to get pregnant again. Stay strong!|`|SHARt1k3aa	You are selfish.  I mean, all I heard was "I care about the way I look" "It took me 2 years to lose the weight" "I finally got my career" Yes, all I heard was me me me.  But, that doesn't mean it's wrong.  I mean, if you don't want another child, you don't want another child.  You will resent the child if you have one.  But, why can't you get any of the things you mention back.  You can always look good, don't blame having a baby on that.  There is maternity leave, so you have that as well.  You just don't want another child and if you don't, just say that, don't come up with all these lame excuses.  Just tell him you don't want another child because you only wanted one and always wanted one.  done deal.|`|qG2SQAPuaa	5 years is not a huge age difference.  Think of it this way.  You will have one leaving high school and one entering.  One leaving college and one entering.  Give him what he wants.  You are just worried about your figure and working.  You never know what your son will do, especially when he becomes a big brother to a "little sister."|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	I think you are being a little selfish. Most only children are spoiled brats. I think that if you do not want kids just state that to your husband. I mean I think that kids are blessings but with you it seems having a child was a chore and having another one would be an even bigger one. Anyways talk to him and tell him where u stand|`|VxC09hX5aa	It's your choice to not give your husband another child with you, but it won't stop him from sowing his seed else where.|`|KAoNgzcFaa	I think he should divorce you|`|79wOWoM0aa	The consequences to your figure should be dead last on the list of priorities. <br>  <br>  If you are so vain (or your husband is so shallow) that you are mostly apprehensive due to that reason, then I don't think you should have anymore kids at all.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think that's a crap reason not to have another kid.  Picking up your career again is a better one, but the real reason should be: what is best for your family?  <br>  <br>  Your family = your husband, you, your existing children, and future children.<br>  <br>  The way you describe it, your family is YOU.<br>  <br>  EDIT what?  You think boys don't care for their younger siblings?  I had two younger brothers and trust me, I was there for them.<br>  <br>  EDIT again: I'm not saying you should have another kid.  If you don't want one, then don't.  I don't fault you for that.  I fault you only for your big reason not to being that you are concerned about your tight butt or whatever.|`|ElyP5kLMaa	I am in a family of 2 kids... Me and my older brother...he is 8 years older that me...<br>  By what u say...Additional Details<br>  That's a big age difference for the children if we do have another one, plus my first one is a son, he will never take care of the younger sibling. I think u can't just looking at 1 way...because my brother did take care of me when i was kid!<br>  I am not taking sides.....<br>  For Her<br>  1.  I can understand u don't want to lost ur job by having another 1. Spec's right now the markets so bad. even u 2 adults don't eat..the kid still have! (I am from a very poor family)<br>  2.  Because you!  Take Mommy almost 2 years the slim down!! If u can say this line to ur kid..I have to say u got the Right to say it to ur Husband for excuse.

Me and my husband have been together for almost 9yrs but I wasn't ready until last year to really start trying. You both have to be on the same page when it comes to a child but you also have to take into consideration what he wants.|`|ShLfWHfgaa	he will be the first man to have one
0fVtHNtmaa	All your questions are the same. I think you're obsessed at this point.|`|kJ0tNA4Vaa	people dont forget people|`|NUS7MIVRaa	I think you are overreacting and just being paranoid about it.  She has told you that she's been busy...if ya'll have been dating for this long and ya'll are making plans for next week, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  Good luck to ya'll!!|`|Gzjx99hBaa	the problem with this is that it could really be two things and you just need to ask her. <br>  she could just be busy like you said. <br>  or she might just not be that into you... and if she isnt then move on man.. trust there are so many more peole out there even though it may not feel like that right now.|`|YkLAFRAxaa	she wont forget about you if she really likes you:)<br>  but if she does leave she wasnt the one for you;)|`|WDJH7KBEaa	sounds like your doing the right thing...dont worry about her forgetting you just dont worry.|`|QCa4Pffqaa	don't worry about it too much. if she didnt wanna be with you, she would've broke up.  not to scare you or anything, you dont think shes been hanging out with some other guy, right? but besides that maybe just text her everyday, and ask her if shes busy or not. shes your girlfriend she should have time for you.|`|VtJ5kRgIaa	just text her something cute, i get mad when my bf doesnt text me at least once throughout the day.|`|3b439d9a67a6c2ad214cd95b7a1343b5aa	Hmmm...this one's tricky. It's only been a couple of months, so you guys don't know each other THAT well. Right now, you'll have to take her at her word and assume she's being straight up with you. It's only been a few days since you guys had contact...so try to relax and focus on something else.<br>  <br>  As a woman, I enjoy it when a man knows when to back off and give me space and let me come to him. When someone means something to me, I never forget them and if she's telling you that she really likes you, that means she won't forget you. <br>  <br>  I think her being busy could be legit. I know it is for me when I say it. If she wants to be with you and is genuinely enjoying you, you've got nothing to worry about when giving her time and space. You'd do more damage to the budding relationship by jocking her and being insecure than by relaxing and going with the flow.<br>  <br>  Push come to shove, give her a call and talk to her. Find out if there's anything going on that she needs help with or wants to talk about. Just be there for her in general. If she says that she's just busy with things, let her know that you're going to give her the space she needs to handle business and that it's up to her to reach out to you when she's ready. Then wait her out.<br>  <br>  Just my thoughts...|`|Tj2jMlTvaa	It sounds like she's just busy like she said. You said you guys were just coming off a romantic weekend and that things were good between you to......so just let it be. If when you texted her and she responded back, then that's a good thing because she could have just let it go, but she didnt. Now if you keep pushing and acting like a nutso! on the low by constantly calling..then she may back off. Do just relax and enjoy what you do have now|`|grTFRJVjaa	sounds like she has just been busy like she said. and she says she likes you too. you have to ask your self do you think that she is into you like you are her? keep giving her space but i dont think that it would hurt to check up on her every now and then, just asking her how shes doing not much more than that. but i know its hard to do but stay calm. im in a similar position at the moment.
euSMSQl9aa	I SAY THAT SHE IS A LITTLE CRAZY FOR BITING YOU BUT IF YOU LIKE HER AND HER BITING YOU IS A SYMBOL OF HER ADMIRATION THEN GO FOR IT!|`|HI9glTofaa	I would call that flirting lol same thing happen to me.|`|mU47USSZaa	when i bite a boy that means im sexually attracted to them ;)|`|MQe0lDAMaa	omg like that is so flirting! how old r u? im 13.|`|8rt7OR35aa	maybe she's freaky.<br>  lol.|`|zLGOQQs5aa	That could mean a many number of things. she could have bit you bacause she didnt like you or because shy wanted sex. or she was just horny|`|UP33GlBwaa	She bit you on the arm?  WOW!  That's kinda funny.  If you like it, go get more, my friend.  Are you sure she just didnt nibble?  Do you have marks on your arm?

gK0vcdnDaa	I think that is an amazingly cute idea!<br>  <br>  I think the bags that you are looking at are cute as well.  I love Oriental Trading Co., in fact I am ordering my “take-out” boxed from them, we are doing fortune cookies and s’mores, what a combination, lol!  Both items are important to us and our family and friends know why – inside jokes – but shared with the whole party.<br>  <br>  I also think that shot glasses is a very unique favor.  I’m not on the bandwagon of “favors must be food” I believe that a favor should reflect the couple.  I’m sure there is a good reason you chose a shot glass as your favor (I can only imagine that you are a fun couple) and you should stick with it!  People will toss it in with the rest of their shot-glasses and it will be a memento of a great union, and possibly a great story depending on the reception.  A nice addition to the glasses may be a few kisses in each glass, or jelly beans, or something else small and reminiscent of the two of you.  There again – it totally depends on you. <br>  <br>  Its your wedding do what makes you happy!  I think that the bags you’ve chosen will be nicer than a box.<br>  <br>  Congrats & Good Luck!<br>  -Elle|`|ECe1rgsdaa	I'm not sure the older guests will like this as a favor. But then again, I don't know your guests... So maybe they will! :)|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I like the idea!!<br>  <br>  I know you said not to do food... But, why not use the shot glasses and fill them with some m&m's?  And then put the bag over it with ribbon?  How cute!! :)|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I think that's fine.<br>  A recent wedding we attended had shot glasses with a frosted glassine front with their names and date and some pic (flowers? I forget) - and inside each was a little organza bag in their colour (burgundy) with mini tootsie rolls in it.<br>  The problem -- we didn't know the part with their names was a 'sticker', so when the glasses were washed, it came off!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Not everyone collects shot glasses. Not everyone drinks either that they would use them. Be prepared to have a ton of leftovers. Favors are never required and most people don't miss them if they are not there. If you are on a budget, they are the first things that can be cut.|`|AA11380378	I'm sorry, but the idea is a bit tastless (to put it mildly).<br>  <br>  Maybe in your social circle or your region would be an acceptable favor, but be aware that some people may find it offensive and/or tacky.<br>  <br>  To each it's own, but I wouldn't recommend it<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|JbRTKDFmaa	I like that idea, I think it would be good.|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	Personally, I think you should be careful with shot glasses only because older people, especially religious older people, would feel like it's not an appropriate gift. <br>  <br>  Also, a wedding favor, is just a nice thank you gift to your guests. It doesn't have to be a hard item, a thank you can include edible items. <br>  <br>  However, you should know your family and friend's taste so I do not see anything wrong with the shot glasses. If you really don't want to try pastry box  to put the glasses in you should try Hubert.com or M&N International. Those companies make lots of do dades and do dades containers. I make gift baskets and use Hubert.com for decorative bags and materials. Also, you can buy in bulk from those companies, which would help lower the cost if you have a big wedding party/guest list. I'm guesses that you will have them scripted/engraved for the personal touch. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you don't need a box/bag. You can place items inside of the shot glasses, like a mini dessert-cake/ice cream, candy, etc, or colored pebbles, this way the shot glass can become the container.|`|DutTBV3caa	i think its a really cute idea! <br>  i did the little candy bags but i also forgot about favors til last minute lol. <br>  i think you should do it. like i said, very cute.|`|BnJRwJiEaa	I love the idea but I think I will add a label on the ribbons to say something like we give you a shot of our love. Love you guys names.|`|Y7koJRd5aa	Shot glasses are not tacky and the bag sounds great! Much better than a box. A classic and great favor!!|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Those baggies are cute.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10423186	great  idea|`|q8eue7CRaa	I think it's a really cool idea! I'd like it.|`|ACecbVghaa	"THE POINT OF HAVING FAVORS IS TO HAVE SOMETHING TO REMEMBER THE WEDDING, NOT TO GIVE FOOD AS FAVORS WHICH WOULD BE EATEN IN LESS THEN 2 MINUTES"<br>  <br>  So you'd rather have them remember your wedding as a drunk-fest made possible by the supplying of shot glasses to all in attendance? I would re-think the message you're trying to send... Yes, something that is lasting is good, but a shot of liquor to "dull the pain" or cause intoxication is no way to remember a joyous occasion.|`|zsgHqrtEaa	We did champagne glasses as favors just put them at each place setting.  So if you want, you don't even need the bags - you could just tie a red and white ribbon around them and they would help decorate the tables.|`|bCgW89MLaa	I have to agree with others that say that shot glasses are a bit tasteless.  Is this a formal wedding?  Would your grandma really want a shot glass to remember your day with?|`|X5aMV1Pmaa	Shot glasses are tacky as a wedding favor - sorry, but that's how I feel.  You're better off using those nice sashey baggies and putting food in there.|`|xuiSfzgraa	I like that!  Or you could always wrap them in tule to match your colors and tie with a ribon...But I def. like the shot glass idea!|`|P0OV39nuaa	I think it might look tacky, I would go with a clear bag or a solid color not the printed.|`|c4135808b48d589a16889fe0f1cecf39aa	Very cute idea!
sXnoIFRsaa	So your Dad is sick in the hospital and she dumps you.  This says so much about her.  What would happen if someone died or was sick again, where would she be?  When times are tough those that stick by you and remain at your side are those that truly care about you.  Those that are aloof and "fair weather" friends are just that and not to be trusted.  Dude you ain't in love you are merely smitten and you need to get over this chick and move on and stop with this charade.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	She might be playing you. Love has to be a two-way street or it doesn't flow well. If your feelings for her are so much stronger than hers for you, U need to rethink this whole adventure. <br>  Most guys would not pine away like that for a whole year. They would go after another girl. The emotions we feel inside are very different from what others may feel for us. Do not let this girl get U all tangled up inside. <br>  If she does not treat U right please find someone else who will.|`|jlUczlQZaa	So, you went out for 2 weeks and were friends beforehand.....and this is how she treats you?

The pain just won't go away and it feels like you will hurt forever.  I know how you feel because the same thing happened to me.  My father in the hospital...and I was thinking that my g/f would be really supportive.   That just didn't happn.  We broke up and then I was getting lots of signals and just got really confused about what she wanted.<br>  A good friend of mine said just to walk away and make a clean break because otherwise, she would just continue to break my heart.  So, thats what I did.  I mean it hurt for a long time, but I got over her.  So, walk away Tom.  try to forget her and let yourself heal.  Give yourself time to get over her and move on.  Don't let her make you crazy.|`|pUUyYz4gaa	People have their reasons for what they do, and one year ago things might have been different. Think more about where you stand right now, and maybe talk to her about how you feel about what happened.  You deserve an answer. <br>  <br>  I suggest you don't rule her out as a companion, but take some time.  Maybe start over with her until you get some answers and/or you begin to feel comfortable about this relationship.|`|bGjQNtd8aa	She is feeling something different than you are, something not as commited and deep, best move on and understand that you will feel this way for a long long time.|`|whYPpRXRaa	Bros B4 Hoes Man, lol screw the ******
54042690d0ee8dda741121976af71b28aa	Having friends of the opposite sex is one thing but there's no way that would be okay. I think it's disrespectful to still be in touch with an ex. Also, despite the fact that they've known each other for years, it doesn't change the issue of this guy being an ex. <br>  <br>  If he were just a friend that never had romantic feelings for your wife, it would be different. I don't think your wife can see your side of things at all. You should talk really talk to her about it. How would she feel if you decided to be friends with an ex-girlfriend?<br>  <br>  It's your marriage and ultimately your decision but there's no way in hell that would fly in my marriage.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	If he was her friend before you came along, he will continue to be her friend after you are gone.<br>  <br>  She's with you.  Accept it.  Get over the fact that she gets along with her ex.  Mature people can do that, you know.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I don't like it and I'm kind of facing the same thing currently with my boyfriend, who says he "loves his ex wife."  They've been divorced for 6 years and it's never been anything but friendship, plus they have a child together and are both great parents.<br>  <br>  I've spoken with my friends and family that I trust and they feel this means he has that to give me, so until I have a reason to NOT trust him, I have chosen to trust him (we're also not married and aren't going to be until I'm really good with this).<br>  <br>  If a person is going to cheat, they can do it with an ex, they can do it with a stranger and either way, there's nothing you can do about it.

He say no. I say no and my husabnd says no. Now, I know you have no idea who I am, who my husband is or our teacher :) but I suggest doing some research on it if you feel your gut feeling isn't enough for you. If my husband had a close female friend who he had previously dated....I'd go crazy and I am not the overreacting type. Your concern is justified. Most marriage counselors would say it is not appropriate because it's a distraction from your relationship with your spouse. It's also a temptation. What may initially be an innocent rekindling of a relationship could end up a mistake later on. <br>  What I suggest? Talk to your wife. COMMUNICATE with her how it makes you feel. Make her aware that it is not a jealousy that is brought on because she is talking to another guy...it's that she's talking to another guy and having a friendship with a guy she used to date romantically. It jeopardizes your marriage. Talk to her lovingly and calmly....be supportive of her friendships but tell her why this particular friendship is not helathy. You trust her, sure, but help her to see that she would have doubts as well if the situation was reversed...if it was you who was talking to an ex-girlfriend. <br>  One other thing I suggest is getting into a marriage class - not therapy - just a marriage building class....lots of churches offer them...they help deepen your relationship with each other. My husband and I went to a six week one (one class each Wed night) and it worked wonders with us! Best of luck and talk to her :)|`|frN73zikaa	The kind of friendship ex can keep is loving affair because both of their memories are related to loving affair and keep thinking of their past probably they may come to realize that their previous affair with each other is better then their present lover, and if both of them cannot control them self it can happen in the wrong way, so I will advise you don’t accept that at all.  For real I can’t accept such a thing. Trust me.<br>  <br>  If an ex will have a relationship it must not be on text or phone.it has to be in an open way.not thinking of ex... not going to visit ex... not calling or texting ex <br>  <br>  and probably if they meet on the road that all, We all know relationship must do with phone calls and testing as that are love symbols not any things eals.<br>  <br>  I don’t even like seen my gf alone with any guy or talking with another guy on phone, it bothering me because I love her very much an I kind of jealous… that just me. ?

I think you may have done her a favor.  If he was rude enough to say bad things about her because he was angry at you, then he must not have cared about her as much as she thought.  Besides, its better that she know now how he "really" feels about her, rather than after the wedding happened.  I'm sure your bf's mom isn't too happy now, but in the long run I think she will realize the favor you actually did for her daughter.  As a mother, she actually should have told him that herself.

At this point, it's up to them to decide if they will take what you said seriously or not.|`|IvMPh09baa	so her fiancee got mad at her for something you said?<br>  <br>  no. you spoke up to him, and if he is directing his anger at her then she needs to see that for herself. sorry hon, but hate to burst your bubble here... you didn't do anything to cause this.  you simply said what you thought.... now instead of going off on you if he is that angry about your opinion, he decided to go off on her.  thats abuse.  you didn't cause it, she didn't cause it, this guy is a total douche and until she leaves him nothings going to change.<br>  <br>  i think you should try talking to her, ask her why she is with a man that puts her down so much.|`|SsfnitjXaa	You go girl!  You did nothing wrong.  It is about time that girls start standing up for our sister's.  Now that the problem has been brought out in the open she can decide what she wants to do. (I bet she goes back to being a doormat, because she wants a man and thinks there are no other man in the world that would want her).  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't bring it up again unless she brings up the problem one on one with you.<br>  <br>  Be prepared to have to listen to his shhhh in the future and if I were you I would walk out of the room (calmly) every time he does.<br>  <br>  There is something seriously wrong with this gal and guy.|`|u1uECuFNaa	What was wrong about that?<br>  You spoke your mind, nothing wrong with that...<br>  Although you could have waited until you had her alone to bring it up...<br>  I would have yelled at you...says a lot he yelled at her after YOUR outburst.|`|sCCjAKllaa	There ain't nothin you can do right now, except mind your business in the future.

What's done is done and if you telling him your opinion of his treatment of her is enough to break them up, they didn't have much to break up...<br>  <br>  I personally think that your bf's mother is a big girl and can deal with this as an adult.  If she cannot, then you do not need to be involved with this family.  jmo<br>  <br>  FURTHER, you did nothing wrong socially.  It was a group dinner, the subject was women's rights.  If you chose the subject, don't do that again, because it makes for strained conversation no matter what people personally believe about it.|`|9ebf7fd4431967c61856700a5363bf7faa	This exact thinh has happened to me before but to a dating soon 2 be engaged couple... he would always to tell her to shhh and not in front of his friends and when she did say sumthin then we would tell her to leave asap... i didn't really no wat was happening till i started to hang out with them and then one day i was in a very pissy mood and told him that u shhh and let her tak 4 once... we don't always have to hear wat you have to say... and they had a huge fight butthen their relationship had changed in a gud way he would respect her and let her tak and not be so male power hungry... so you did the right thing by apolozing and if he doesn't accept it then its his prob not yours you had the right intention when you said wat you did and you felt bad at the end and said sry idk if he said anything back but don't worry it just went wrong and that happens alot i mean did ur bf say anythin... and his mom will yes think of an opnion of you but it will be a gud one saying that you are watching out for ur bf sis and you do have self respect in you... don't worry everything happens for a reason... gud luck|`|PeMpDAbraa	Whats done is done.

As a women, you were offended by his behavior and you had ever right to say something.  If your bf brother wouldn't defend her, then kudos to you for saying something to this jerk!  You did her a favor and things she's probably been wanting to say to him herself were probably said.  Look, I wouldn't worry about it.  If they have issues with the truth, then they should face them before getting married.|`|6dhEB2nBaa	You just did her a huge favor! By you standing up for her maybe she will learn to stand up for herself!|`|tCI8ksvdaa	It sounds like all of these relationships are dysfunctional.  I suggest you all break up and find new partners.|`|0LvWiESWaa	So, you are going to take responsibility for her boyfriend being disrespectful to her? <br>  <br>  You called him out. He couldn't handle it. He completely took the focus off of him and put on her and you. <br>  <br>  Let me tell you this...if someone said to me that I was doing something that was wrong or disrespectful to my husband, I wouldn't throw a tantrum right there. I might tell that person to mind their own business or something...but, more importantly, I would talk to him about it and ask if he felt that way.<br>  <br>  I think it's great you said something. Someone needed to have the balls to.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	In the future - MYOB.  You had the right intentions but they went way wrong...If she didn't like being treated that way - she'd put an end to it...sadly, it doesn't sound like that's how it's going to go down.|`|Vbdfphhbaa	well,it was'nt you...I would love to say MYOB but well,whats done is done. you spoke your mind and that was it. it seems tho there was a problem and now its in the open. let them sort it out. sending a card is not needed. really since when saying something like what you said wrong? if he cant handle hearing someone's opinion,well thats not your fault. whats sad is that he took his anger off on her,now thats wrong. talk to your boyfriend and ask him what he thinks. honestly,you may be surprised as to what he may say. he may have noticed this too and may have told his sister,but she may have not listened.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Not really. All you did was add sme fuel to an already explosive situation. It had to blow sooner or later and it just so happened with you around. What you said was the truth but she needed to get some courage up ad tell him herself or be the little scared kitten she spoke of. It sounds like she was just waiting for the right moment do it and you only provided that outlet and it happened. Sometimes in relationships, some people put up with a little too much in order to preserve the relationship and/or are just afraid of conflict. A little conflict in a relationship is good so what happened last night was bound to happen anyway so now they can clear the field and start anew. I seriously doubt you caused any real damage, but in fact actually did them some good so neither has to walk around on eggs. Dont worry about them too much, theyll recover i their love is true and be alright.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	You didn't do anything wrong. He is insecure and a control freak. If it wasn't you, it would have been someone else. You cannot blame yourself for their problems. He is out of line and needs to hear it. It's unrealistic to think that a guy can treat his woman this way in front of others without seeing consequences for his actions. If he blames her or the person who told him, it just shows his lack of ability to recognize his own faults and to take ownership of his actions. I hope he either grows up or leaves her to find someone who treats her right.|`|buAj586Zaa	don't be sorry for anything you said , you were just speaking the truth and its true .. no one should get treated like that .. and maybe deep down inside she wanted that help and it felt good for a change for someone else to pick up for her b/c she's been hiding her feelings and not say anything .. sometimes people need that little boost . as for you , you were right , it was your place .. i understand you may feel bad b/c their relationship but it was the right thing its better they work things out now then going on to a next step in life !<br>  <br>  just don't live in regret .. what is said is done with !|`|y4w6ybr3aa	I think you did the right thing.<br>  I would be surprised if your bf's mother will have a problem with it, after all you did stick up for her daughter.<br>  I would talk to the sister privately next time you see her and let her know that your sorry, but you cant stand to see him treat her like that.

IDK, moms usually know what's good and not for you, although it is your life, and ultimately, no one can make decisions for you except you, but in my opinion, I would give ya'll friendship a while first in order for you to determine who he really is.  You don't need a troubled boy in your life....he will only complicate yours.  Best wishes.|`|BnJRwJiEaa	I think you should be his friend not girlfriend, try to change the guy so he won't be such a troublemaker any more.  I don't want you to get into trouble and disappoint your mother, sister, and friend.  Maybe set your feelings aside and try to steer him in the right direction improving his grades, behavior and maybe later y'all can be a couple, but for now please don't get yourself into any trouble with this guy.|`|zC2900V8aa	I am probably going to tell you exactly what you don't want to hear.  I am twenty one and have been dating for quite awhile.  I remember all of my crushes and "relationshipd" and I know sometimes experience is the best teacher sometimes.  I know right now it seems like he is the guy on top of the world but let me tell you, he isn't.  Your personalities will change soooo much from now until your out of school and so on and so fourth!  If I could go back in time I would have never had a boyfriend through middle school and highschool because to be honest now it seems like such a big waste of time and emothions!  Then again I did learn from each experience with each guy and it has lead me to my fiance today!  I have dated the guys that my parents couldn't stand and I think those were the ones I wish I didn't get into.  It causes a lot of stress and lots of arguments between you and your family.  While he may not be the one you waltz down the isle with your family will always be there for you and guys will come and go.  Your mom will always be there to wipe those tears away in between each breakup.  If I could go back and be in your shoes I wouldn't waste time with him.  I know it seems right now that your mom just doesn't understand and that she is holding you back from something great but she really just wants the best for you.  Someone who is constantly in trouble and jepordizing their education is someone you really need to think about getting into a relationship with in any way.  In these times not having a good education can equal a very difficult life.  If Michael really did love or like you he would also love and respect your parents decisions!  You have a long road ahead of you and he will not be the last guy that steels your heart away.  I know I probably sound like an old fart to you but trust me...Been there and done that and I'm just letting you know what I would do if I could go back and do it over again.  I suggest not worrying about boyfriends right now and just have boy "friends" at the most.  Again I wasted so much time not doing things or going places or talking to certain other guys all because I had a "boyfriend" that was oh so special at the time lol.  Unfortunatly those feelings just come with being girls and we are so quick to give our hearts and time away!  I'm sorry if its not what you want to hear but please just trust me on this one...you will find a crush you parents actually like that will make this guy seem like ole news...plus your lucky...my parents didn't even let me have boy phone calls at 8 yrs old!!! lol!  Wish you luck babes!|`|00f9b13066000aa39eb7b7036e571513aa	it is not a good idea to get involved with someone ur mom doesnt like, ur family, and friends, should approve of who ur with. if things were to get serious would u want to fall into trouble with the guy, i doubt it since he's a trouble maker. i think u should just stick to being friends, i wouldnt get involved with a bad boy because you will then be bad by association|`|7VyHmYogaa	well you should just listen to your mom and sister because they know what s good for you... and probably if you go out with that guy your going to suffer more than your doing right now for not going out with him... so just try to move on and don't go out with the trouble maker...|`|X4VrAdyYaa	It doesn't matter what your mom thinks, it only matters when he asks your dad for your hand in marriage.

etV271ARaa	Is he feeling like he wants to be single again? It feels like that. Texting and keeping in touch with women means he's still open for business. Is he? Ask him and if you dont get a straight answer, walk. I'll tell you this, if he's been with you for so long, its just the proverbial "7 year itch" stress test your relationship and he'll come back. He's too secure and comfortable and bored. Work on that too.......|`|hSY0LuCOaa	You know how they say a thief always thinks someones stealing from him? well a cheater always thinks someones cheating him. Maybe he freaks out about men texting you bc he knows he doesn't want you talking to them (or doing things with them) like he does with his chickies. You can lay down the law on this, but odds are if you already talked to him about it and he's still doing it, he's not going to stop. If anything he'll just get sneakier about it. Personally, I'd drop this one, he seems to be missing the "committed" part of your "committed relatioship"|`|xvxtQwV5aa	this sounds all too familiar. play his game. he doesn't give you an explanation so why should you give him one? He's basically telling you that it's okay to text guys. Also, beware. a common sign of cheaters is that they try to make you look like the bad guy so it gets the attention off them. it's called deflection, i think. don't fall for that crap. I'm so fed up dealing with this kind of behavior in my own life. Beat him at his own game. If you can't text, neither can he, bottom line. If he wants to try and accuse you of anything, you tell him what ever dumb*** excuse he tells you to try and justify what he's doing. The truth is, he's not going to stop, so just get used to it. Learn to play the game, or drop him if you just can't hang.
wkMncMobaa	Rach,<br>  <br>  I have been there, done that.  I was you in the situation, and my EX-wife would be him.  So you can already see where this is going.  Choice of venue is a HUGE decision.  I was forced (coerced) to move to a farm in the country and while I loved my wife (EX-wife now) I had feeling of resentment.  There is really no way not to feel that way.  So I had this great woman and a great life, then all of the sudden, I'm a horse farmer??  My advice to you would be to tell him how seriously this is concerning you.  Let him know that you love him so very much, but you are afraid you might end up resenting him for it.  Above all though, please please please, do not move to the country if you are a city girl.  If he loves you, then you can at the very least talk about a compromise.  Maybe the suburbs?  Good luck!|`|tCI8ksvdaa	More marriages and relationships are destroyed because of little disagreements which remained unresolved than are destroyed by the big issues such as adultery.

That's what being in a relationship is all about...compromise.  So perhaps you two could move somewhere in-between the rural area & the urban area.|`|fAiZdvWwaa	Try staying with him for a few days or maybe a few weeks, just to see if the countryside will work for you. If you are still uncomfortable with the idea, postpone the wedding. An issue as important as where your home will be is plenty of reason to postpone for a while. <br>  Also, try to get him to stay with you for a few weeks, so he can understand how it feels as well. <br>  Don't give in just because he's stubborn-- it's unfair for you to have to give up your city life so he doesn't have to give up his rural life. <br>  Also, try to come up with a compromise. Maybe move somewhere between your town and his village. <br>  And most importantly, never give in because you're afraid of losing him. As someone who loves you, your boyfriend has no right to toy with you like that, and it is childish of him to ignore an issue this important to you just because he thinks you'll get used to it. That's hardly a reason.|`|SsfnitjXaa	A 3 hour a day commute is ridiculous.  Married woman do not need arcades.

Find a place close to where your boyfriend lives and try living there, see if it works out for you.  If you move in together, well that will be a real test...lol  good luck.
gTfIQaHcaa	I actually quite agree with what Kirstie had to say: the most harmonious solution for both of you would be to move to an area which is situated between the urban and rural, so that you both have a little distance to travel but in the end the environment you both love is not very far away. <br>  I think if you do move in with him there is a fair chance that you would adapt rather easily anyway, but I don't think that it would be the best solution for both of you. I strongly support the 'in-between' idea, that way you both have to compromise a little and you both win a little!<br>  Plus, if you were in-between the urban and the rural, you would be much closer to all the things that you love and would miss (other than your boyfriend of course!) and he would still remain within reasonable travelling distance of the things he would love and miss (other than you!). <br>  The last thing I'd like to say (as my own fiance and I are getting married this year and I've had plenty of time to discuss this issue with him for our own circumstances) is this: love is not blind, but intelligent. That means that since you both love each other, you need to sit down and talk about the things that are troubling either of you, keeping in mind that the key word is compromise. If neither of you can learn to compromise, you may have a very difficult time of making a successful marriage! I would hate for that to happen to you!<br>  Bear in mind that when I say compromise, I don't mean sacrifice. Sacrifice is quite different, and involved giving up the entirety of a thing/things that you really want/love/need in order to help something/someone else. Too much of doing that can start to damage you after a while, so be careful!<br>  Compromise!<br>  <br>  I hope I was able to help you.<br>  Take care and good luck sorting it all out! :)|`|JtEBaOdjaa	He wants you to commute 1.5 hours EACH way every day?  That's unreasonable.  How about you guys move 1/2 way between city and where he is?  Both of you give things up and both of you keep things. Compromise!<br>  I think this is one of those things that's worth fighting over.  His request is unreasonable.|`|AA11603468	Maybe you should try it out for a while before marrying him. I know I could never stand to spend 3 hours every single day commuting to and from a job. Besides, the fact that he doesn't seem willing to make any concessions to you is troubling to me. Can't you move to a place somewhere closer to your job, and the life you know, but maybe just outside of town? That way, you won't be right in the city (which he doesn't like) but you won't be so far away that it would be difficult on you? If he doesn't want to move 45 minutes away from his family, you might need to ask whether he is independent enough to make a good husband.|`|gpL7W3jAaa	Is there a town in between the town you live in and the town he lives in? If so, why don't you both move out of where you are now and more somewhere in the  middle. That way you are both starting new together and it will lesson the commute for you|`|3M3htWrBaa	if you are willing to live with him where he lives than go and look for a job close to your new home. if you can't find one than try and see if he will consider moving half way between the city and his village. i think that you two will work it out both of you need to listen to the other and devise a plan|`|tGEHK7TTaa	Marriage is about sacrifice.  If your job and your comfort are more important that your fiance then you shouldn't get married.  You both are being stubborn and selfish.  Marriage only works when two people are committed to meeting the needs of the other ones.  He should be willing to give up his life for you, and vice versa.|`|DDuLoMWxaa	marriage is all about give and take. just make a compromise. and buy a place in between wer u both live. den ur both sacrificin and ur both not losing out.|`|nqINitkmaa	Maybe the two of you can compromise, move in between the rural area and the city area. That way no one has to move too far away from their job and you are both still close to the places you love! The rest of your life is going to be filled with situations like this, even harder ones, this is a good way for the two of you to start to overcome your first disagreement.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	ok for one thing your boyfriend obviously doesnt respect your feelings because he obvioulsy thinks he knows how you are feeling about the situation by saying "he is sure youll be ok with that with time" he doesnt know how you feel and so it was wrong of him to make such a huge assumption. you have the right to voice your opinion. maybe you two can meet in the middle. you not fully in the city and him not fully in the rural. being in a relationship is all about compromise. and it seems like he isnt willing to do anything but do it his way....you need to voice your concerns not just voice it but TELL him. so he gets the picture because to me hes being selfish
IUnC3dbraa	Stop thinking about it so much! Just do what feels right. If you like him and have fun flirting with him, just take things slowly and see where it goes! If "something feels wrong" then you obviously do not have feelings for him in that way and you could nicely let him know that you like him just as a friend.|`|N73orVHBaa	I was in the same position, kinda. My "brother" told me he might love me. What I did, was let him know that it didn't bother me, but a relationship would mess up what he already have. Now for you, if something feels wrong, then maybe being friends' is all you were meant to be. Flirting with him will only worsen the situation for the both of you. Keep it simple, be his best friend and if in the long run something happens then so be it|`|AA10350119	Yeah I would give him a chance, and since he is close to you it shouldn't be awkward to tell him what your thinking about. You never know even if he is just like a best friend brother to you he could always turn out to be the one! and teasing isn't always good unless you follow through.|`|xw6XRcN7aa	Just tell him how you really feel and hope that it gets through his thick skull, if he's like family and you've known eachother for a long time he'll know what you mean. Just tell him. good luck! :)|`|MLbUrrztaa	give him a chance you never know how perfect somthing might turn out to be =]|`|ZsKGRuZvaa	umm i think that you should ask him out since you both obviously like each other|`|uFWc1m3Raa	go out with him it never hurts to try and i would tell him you feelings have changed for him because you rejected him|`|mpGjPV6Xaa	The only way to find out, is by giving him a chance to see what type of guy he really is. If he turns out to be no good, then just break up with him. If he turns out to be an ok guy, then what you have to lose ?<br>  <br>  Hope I help !!<br>  <br>  Joseph D : )|`|XGo8O6bXaa	ugh, just do not break and say yes when he asks you out. that would hurt him more. just, talk about some other guy and he will get sad and stop.|`|FpwRrOwxaa	Give him a chance. Your relationship might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened.|`|Sm2MzPDuaa	Go out on a date with him, everyone deserves a chance right?<br>  being a tease is not nice.|`|TnjNnVNraa	well..the thing is you see him like a brother so that happen to me cuz my best friend he is so COOL & funny & we flirt also & i love him like a bro so i don't want to  be in a relationship with him cuz i don't want anything to change because i like the relationship we have and i want it to stay like that cuz if we go out or mess around things could change if we brake up and that will hurt both of us so explain ti him how you feel..|`|3eKLnP3Caa	Well obviously there's something there that you're afraid of, maybe you're afraid that if it doesnt work out, u'll be losing a good friend. all i can say is to just jump in and try the relationship, if you guys are as close as you say you are, he'll be okay if you still dont feel taht connection, but if you do well then, that makes both of you even happier than you were before  doesnt it?|`|PmJdmMduaa	i've been in the same situation before. mine was a bit more complicated than just being friends, but i learned from experience that friends are meant to be friends. i took the chance in making my being friends with him go further than what i was intentionally looking for in him. it really depends on the both of you and what you two want. if you don't want to be in a relationship with him, don't push yourself. you can't force yourself to like anyone or else it will end up dirtier than it started. i would say to stay friends with him. don't want to mess things up while in a relationship.<br>  <br>  on the other hand, if you really like him, go for it! it wouldn't hurt to get into a relationship with someone you like because it's just awesome how close you two are since you two are both good friends as it is.<br>  <br>  so there's two sides to it. good luck! :D|`|7zIAKszxaa	if he really likes you give it a chance you never know what could happen he could make it worth while to be in a relationship well i think you should go for it dont let fear hold you back its better to live life on the edge then never live at all<br>  <br>  good luck?<br>  email if needed|`|oHN6jwjoaa	tell him how you feel.<br>  either way you are going to break his heart.<br>  and you are wasting both of your time by holding on to him.<br>  you are leading him on and its hard to break that off after its been going on for a while.|`|8O9rm5deaa	Yeah, i'd give him a chance. If you like him, it might work out.<br>  Just make sure you don't think it will ruin your current relationship|`|RJGmNMn6aa	yeahh i would give him a chance.|`|RQ7utEMBaa	you never know if you could be turning down that one true love

lGBbWsuSaa	Yeah i think theyre 2 different things. Flirting can just be how sum1 acts normally and just messin around...while hitting on sum1 is like tryin to get with them ; ]|`|hXFndli2aa	IDK|`|tPRRUs4Jaa	yeah, i think they're different. i also think that sometimes you don't even know if you're really "flirting" with someone. to you, it may be just being friendly but to someone else, it could totally be flirting. <br>  but hitting on someone means that you're actually trying to make something happen. <br>  complete different things.|`|8OREBeRdaa	I think when you're flirting you're trying to be casual.  But that raises another question.  If a guy is paying a girl a compliment or two, is he flirting?  And he's not trying to pick her up, btw.<br>  <br>  I think "hitting on someone" is being pretty forward.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I think the lines on this are pretty blurred sometimes.|`|YBIiEF3Paa	i think they are noth different.|`|xgJbxZgfaa	same thing|`|9dvDlMdhaa	Flirting and hitting on some one is not the same thing. WHen you flirt your either touchy feel talking in a way to the person. WHen your hitting on a person your like can i get your number or something like that. They are 2 totally different things.|`|wCAuZBtZaa	flirting and hitting on someone is different.. when u flirt, u r trying to have fun while talking to someone and just having a good time ntohing personal but when u r hitting on someone, you r trying to get with her and even get laid..(SeX)|`|SRPwwLJ9aa	when you flirt your just messing around at times<br>  <br>  but when you flirt to get to know the person a bit better and actually want to go out with them then it turns into you hitting on that person|`|mJo35PwXaa	i think there totally different|`|HykE5X0Laa	Thats a no-brainer, doll. :)|`|oHN6jwjoaa	they are different.<br>  you said it yourself!|`|jBZJkSjWaa	..wrong..same thing|`|Lpc2aAzRaa	its the SAME thing|`|Pxh93GHcaa	They both are completely different thing. Flirting is more casual behavior and can persist with many people around. There is not much of a motto in flirting. You just do it and do not really expect form the other end. Now on the other side hitting on some one has some define motto and also has some level of expectations. People who generally trying to hit on some one mostly concentrate one person at a time but you will notice that people can flirt with multiple people at the same time|`|1BJKxu09aa	its totally different cuz it brings happiness and adds a little spice to life. Mind you, flirting does not by default end up in sex. The definition of flirting puts it in the parameters of the road to travel and not the destination. This is why most people find flirting extremely exciting – just like foreplay i guess.|`|vhEZJd2Oaa	Just who are you trying to kid with your “innocent flirtation”, miss temptress muffet.<br>  Flirting IS hitting on someone. Its just oh-so subtle.<br>  Or hitting on someone is just aggressive flirtation. Often with nauseating consequence.<br>  You’re just trying to rationalize your behavior.Have a clear look in the mirror, princess. Lets call a freckle a freckle. And a flirt a flirt.|`|bL9Cpsfyaa	Flirting is something you do for fun.  It can be used to establish a relationship, but there usually isn't much intention behind it.<br>  <br>  Hitting on someone is when you make a direct attempt to make a connection.<br>  <br>  They're similar, but different.|`|orabzb0Naa	I agree.  I think hitting on someone is more like asking for a date.  I think saying "hey baby, you look really fine today" is borderline, but I guess that would be hitting on someone.  I guess there can be a fine line and it depends on the person.|`|zpuIRCECaa	hitting on someone to me is of a more sexual nature, flirting can be more casual and show someone you are interested in them without telling them directly.|`|qroOTyrGaa	Flirting is being friendly, hitting on someone can be very blatant. If my friend told me my boyfriend was out and flirting with someone I wouldn't be quite as mad as if she said he was hitting on her.|`|QZvfVOOzaa	They're synonyms, they mean the exact same thing...|`|mnjHw9ARaa	completely diffffff|`|To6cfSwFaa	pretty much the same|`|q6ASL3Dmaa	it is the same thing.|`|KHhqmo4Oaa	I don't know, sounds the same to me
3x0yE0fPaa	dont stay with him. if he is even questioning it then he is not worth being with. you deserve better than someone like that. plus if you stay with him then he knows that he can talk to other girls and stuff but that you will still stay with him. you become like a backup when these other girls don't work out. he will just end up walking all over you. sorry :( you can do better!!|`|na8ObA5Haa	NO WAY girl. drop his a** before he drops yours. your not his little pet that just sits there and waits for him to decide who he wants to be with, he is a pig! you deserve so much better. get rid of him and find someone that is actually worth your time|`|lohDhzRzaa	if you really like him well then stay with him:)<br>  if you dont well then dont stay with him...|`|PDmWBDSbaa	You should find a boyfriend that really loves you and cares about you because if he's confused or has to think about it then he really doesn't have strong enough feelings if he really has to think about him but still i think about if he stays with you or not then dump him and find someone else way better! you should really think about it. don't let him have you just because or until he finds someone else he likes|`|KHhqmo4Oaa	That so call boyfriend of you is a cheap piece of jerk. Dump him and get your purse and a couple of friends. You should be celebrating for leaving him. Think of your dignity|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	find someone who will treat you with respect<br>  and you shold get some self esteem<br>  he is just a guy<br>  you dont NEED a guy to be a success|`|Tzhj39tmaa	why would you stay with this guy when he ask to ask himself whether he likes another girl more, even if he stays with yuo your not going to be happy. He's not good enough for you dump him|`|frBor6E3aa	Way to be gentleman<br>  find someone that will respect you <br>  He said he will tell you at the end of the week...honey dump him now don't let him walk all over you he is a player movee on!!!<br>  Be the dumper not the dumpee....<br>  its beneath his dignity to cheat              <br>  HOPE I HELPED :)
AA10039322	Be perfectly honest with both your parents...let them know how important it is to you that you get to attend your friends 16th party, let them know you will be on your best behavior and be home right after the party ends at 1am., however; if mom & dad is against you attending this party all together, you have to respect their decision! Best of luck!|`|Y9nJxRlpaa	well, for starters you might wanna say that how responsible you are. and how you can be trusted with even more greater responsibility. also you might wanna mention that you will at least call your parents to say where you are at least every 30min to 1hour. because that way your parents can be and feel more safe knowing that you are okay|`|Tx5T4Sq1aa	Sit them down and explain the situation. The more they know the better they feel. Give them your entire game plan for the whole evening and let them think about it.|`|a1PLvvdJaa	just leave|`|kVTbEb1Paa	Introduce them to your "trustworthy" friends, a "escort" and try to show them that you are going out for a FUN time, and you will all be responsible. Hell, if it worked for my parents, it should work for anyone's, provided to bring the right people :P
4SfjIuK1aa	i know exactly where u are hun hang in there <br>  3 years ago i went to a catholic school where everyone made fun of me and i hated more than you can even imagine everyone made fun of me just because they could and i retreated far into myself and i barely even talked at all because if i would say something id be made fun of and i endured this for 8 years and this was my final year also the worst year of them all and i was counting down the days for graduation and to go onto high school i couldn't wait and then when i got there i was soo overwhelmed with all the people i was so scared it took me a while to get the hang of things but people were nice and so i had some friends but i was still that really quiet girl, so i decided after a while that i was sick of it and i just wanted to be myself and so i was the hyper crazy girl i am <im adhd> and everyone wanted to be my friend it made me so happy and i was so amazed everyone was so nice <br>  if you want to make things the way they are meant to be you just have to release yourself let yourself loose and just act the way that comes naturally be who you are meant to be <br>  and everyone will love you for who you are <br>  hang in there hun|`|bx2saJjUaa	we need pain to get stronger life is not easy life. Sometimes life will be hard or easy.We all make mistakes but we learn from them.life is full of stuff.life is not ever when worst could have happen.life to short to be <br>  sad about stuff. talk to new people.Dont be scared to tell people how you feel. Look at the bright side of stuff.<br>  If there is not a bright side to it then hope for one.<br>  have hope that things will get better. But you gotta try to make them better.|`|0a0d9e39f830aa50f51dc7fbaf228a71aa	We've all felt like that once in a while, maybe more.<br>  Find one best, true friend that you can spill your guts out to and return the favor.|`|zvnNHvNwaa	be patient and pay to go it will help you|`|QlwEFErOaa	look,im being honest i felt like that and i still do,i always think about my appearance just incase people think im ugly,also ive got OCD (obsessive compulsion disorder) its were you feel trapped if like a place is really dirty or untidy and you feel you need to clean,also some times i think people think that im really ugly and that people are always looking at me,sometimes i get so depressed that i don't want to eat,i starve myself,but what you gotta do is think right youre no better than i am and walk out that front door and think to youre self that ur indestructible,im not saying it will work forever just saying think about the good things,it sure has helped me.(sorry for such a long description),<br>  <br>  love and light,<br>  earthchild.|`|nLtFLCMaaa	sure, everybody has this period of time.<br>  from what you say I can see that we're about the same age.<br>  <br>  I also hate my parents, they hate me too. (although i call my parents my mom and grandma, cuz my father was killed when i was 8)<br>  the only way i can cope with this whole hating thing is that i think how after i graduate im starting all clear- im going abroad and i won't communicate with any1 i knew before, possibly not even those 2-3 real friends i have (similar to your situation i also have few friends)<br>  i am also wondering what people think of me, this is completely normal. I'm always like in my mind " does he/she think i look fat in those jeans?" or "is it possible that they think i'm annoying?" <br>  people have always been jealous of my grades as well, since i do study a lot and have  good grades, but i don't care a lot about that. i can give you a very recent example: we had a history test and two boys sitting at the front desk were trying to cheat out of my test and i just didnt let them do it (cuz they have been doing this on EVERY single test we've had) and can you imagine what happened? after the test they came to me and were like "you f-ing b**** how could you do this?" and i was like "yeah right. you should be glad i gave you to cheat before"<br>  people are so disrespectful and are acting as if i owe them something, which i sincerely think i am not.<br>  <br>  but whatever, just don't pay any attention to those losers. <br>  and ignore your parents, you are eventually going to either put up with them or they with you.|`|hHSsMyNpaa	About 25 years ago I felt like I was finished here and I just wanted to meet God face to face.  But I knew that God would want me to stick it out, however bad it got, if I believed in him at all.  In time, circumstances changed and I found new challenges and reasons to live.  You can try to make a move yourself, make a change.  Is your appearance ok ?  Do you need braces ?  The point is do something that makes you look forward to the future and a better day.  Even something like having a makeover could do something to help your self esteem.  I know the answer is much more than this but get started, do something easy.  Don't be lazy about it.|`|YCDS4Am8aa	yes the same things happen to me but i think how its not worth killing myself for and i deal with it and just ignore them because they arent always going to understand me or what i'm going through.. i'm not trying to impose anything but your only true friend is God and people in school only use you when they need you eventually you'll find good friends<br>  <br>  do things like write, draw, listen to music or something soothing|`|DtBeONujaa	No, i havent felt like that.<br>  I hope your okay.<br>  Give me an email and we can talk about it.<br>  I think talking is the best way is to deal with it.<br>  i know what feeling depressed kinda feels like, all my friends were worried and they helped me out. So it feels like its my time to return the favour to others.<br>  So let me help you.<br>  Give me a yell anytime huh|`|lESLtDnmaa	yeah I felt like i wanted to die, that was yesterday after a fight with my mom.|`|9X5YK5Dqaa	I know the feeling..... <br>  You can seek advice from a family friend or their parents as they might do a lot of help. You are going into depression. it may just be because of hormones. Have a long think about what you are going to do. if you die it will be throwing away getting married, finishing education and getting a job. lay in bed and think about all the things wrong and attempt to put things right. you started a new school which should have made things a lot easier for your life so my advice is to find someone to tell these feelings you have. Don't live your life feeling desperately upset. Commiting suicide isn't going to help ethier. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|lJhl3wLAaa	No. I never felt like that. I loved life no matter what. I didn't give my power away to other people. You are in control of you. You can wake up every day and say "I love life, thank you for giving me another day." or you can say "Life sucks, want to die." I think the positive statement feels better. If you think life sucks it will. If you think life is great it is. All of this is temporary. We are always changing and moving foward in life. I'm sure in school you can't think beyond your own life. Picture yourself 5 years, 10 years, 20 years from now. Do you think you will feel better about yourself? Where do you see yourself. Picture the best and work toward it. <br>  <br>  Try reading "The Power of Now" by Eckart Tolle
iIU4u0AIaa	Let me tell you this 4 years different, AIN'T A BIG DEAL AT ALL. It is only but a number. You deff confused and don't you just simply hate that feeling, start making decision girl. You admit you like your man but still think of the other one. And whos ex is talking to which guy you like, if your man is talking to his ex and your not bothered by it then you must really like this September boy. The only person that can figure things out is you honey. You need to think things out. You talking to a guy that your new hubby knows nothing about and knows nothing about you liking him is bad and very disrespectful. So this is my advice and i am sorry to say there is nothing else i can do because the rest if up to u.
1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	Ask them if they're having some financial problems.  They may have been feeling pretty desperate and jumped on you getting a job so that they didn't have to tell you about their financial issues.<br>  <br>  Tell them that getting a job has been a pretty discouraging experience for you.  You got the job to have more independence and to be able to buy things that you want, like a car for instance.  While you understand that it's time to become more responsible for yourself, they've really tempted you to become less responsible because you had a lot less pressure when you were without a job.  Why work to maintain a lifestyle you lived when you weren't working?<br>  <br>  Suggest some things that you could pay for, like clothes and extras like meals out or trips with friends.  School lunches and regular sport fees should be their responsibility.  Obviously, a car should be your responsibility as well as insurance for that vehicle.|`|jwftwLBTaa	They may be having money problems themselves. They might be too embarrassed to tell you.

zdu3gh8jaa	Good on you for defending your wife, your father in law should not have treated her like he did. I think he should first apologise to your wife and he should be proud to have a son in law whom makes a supportive, protective and respectable husband. Well done to you and I hope all goes well with the pregnancy. Congratulations to you both. :-)|`|AA12398373	I want to support your decision to stand up for your wife, she obviously had little to do with the altercation that went on before. Your father in law (her father?) owes her an apology grin or not, and he doesn't seem to me to be the type worthy of respect.<br>  <br>  Respect is earned, it's not a birthright.
65ojSBXgaa	Hi Gail’s here to help you…!!<br>  Ok your friend’s mad at you and you are mad at him because of some chick. Well that’s perfectly normal and in most cases easy to solve. Now your friend’s hurt because:<br>  1: the girl he likes likes you and not him<br>  2: this chick humiliated him in front of you and other peeps (that’s bad)<br>  3: He felt like you chose a girl over him because if you were a true friend you would have checked that girl when she embarrass him stick up for your friend.<br>  4: You should have respected your friends feelings and thoughts (put yourself in his shoes. What would you have done?)<br>  5: now he feels a little betrayed<br>  Now so far you did good on apologizing but do you know why are you apologizing? Or you just did it because he’s mad? Remember your friend is hurt but give him some time he will come around. Let him take a chill pill and then talk to him. Friends since 4th grade, huh? Don’t be mad ok this is a dear friend and no one should take that away. This friend of yours is a big part of your life! Girls come and go and you will always find another but this dear friend of yours you will never find anyone like him..Remember that…    Good Luck   -Gail|`|PuQyYMM8aa	How would you feel if the rules were reversed? You hurt his feelings. And ask yourself if this girl is worth losing your friendship. Is this someone that you can see yourself falling in Love with? If not, then you should not bother with someone that you know your friend likes. It doesn't matter if she doesn't like him. You knew he liked her from the beginning. That means she is off limits.

Your mum is obviously stressed so try taking some of the load off her mind [washing, ironing, looking after your sister and allowing you parents to go out] Your mum probably feels left out because you get to go out and have fun and she is stuck inside or working and doing all the chores - she needs to get out and have a meal with her boyfriend or go to the cinema. Help her, show her that your boyfriend is a good guy, maybe invite him over for dinner [which you will cook]. Your mum is also very protective of you which might be because of all the bad things that happen on the internet. She just doesn't want you or your younger sister to get hurt! Also sit her down and have a good chat with her about what you can do for her to take the load of her mind and also what she can do for you to make you feel a little happier in the situation.<br>  Good Luck<br>  x|`|AA12398373	Rebelling won't work, it will just prove to your mom that she was right not to trust you.<br>  <br>  There is a strong possibility that your mom's lack of trust in you has more to do with her than they have to do with you. That means that you can't MAKE your mom trust you.<br>  <br>  Instead of fretting about her checking up on you, going through your bag, and internet activities, try being an open book to her. If you want her to trust you then hide nothing from her. If she tells you not to do something, don't argue with her about it, just ask her again the next time.<br>  <br>  Eventually she will see that you are not your sister, and that she can treat the two of you as individuals.|`|jlUczlQZaa	Rebeling against your mother as revenge (smoking, etc.) is immature and detrimental.  This may be the reason she is so strict with you, you are not equipped to make sound decisions and act mature enough to respect your parent's boundaries.  Do you actually think rebeling or hurting yourself (smoking, etc.) will get your mother back for her "strictness" -- do you not see how absolutely insane this line of thought is?     <br>  <br>  Teenagers always think their parent's are trying to ruin their life, when, in fact, they are setting guidelines and boundaries to ensure their children don't make serious mistakes that could affect their whole lives.  Trust needs to be earned and only when you have shown you can be trusted to ensure your well-being and ability to make good judgements will your parent's ever back off.<br>  <br>  Your mother has been there, she knows what it's like to be a teenager and only by showing her you are mature enough to make some decisions on your own with good outcomes will you ever earn her trust.<br>  She may be reacting negatively to some of your acts of kindness (cup of tea, etc.) because she sees it as an act of manipulation on your part.<br>  <br>  Talk to her about your feelings and try to see it from her perspective.
KFUsmwItaa	Congrats you asked a question there is no answer to. Love feels different to all 7 billion people in the world.|`|u7o75zipaa	I think it's indescribable.<br>  For me, it's just a feeling of complete contentness. Like everything is perfect in your own little bubble .. and nothing else really matters.<br>  It's caring so much for that other person, that you'd do anything just to be with them.

It's just amazing really.|`|DcbM4S4Uaa	You cant really describe it when you have it, it is more like...well you feel like you can care about someone else, that you trust someone else. That lying next to them is the only thing you want in life and when you see them you can feel your heart pumping and when you hold their hand you both grip it as you dont want to let go. Though these are only things that you can do, when you are in love....you know it, simply.<br>  When you feel comfortable with someone and can say "I love you" and mean it from the bottom of your heart. <br>  Hope this helps|`|FBmahP95aa	What is love?

mMBzpldbaa	if he's a sex offender then why the hell should he have help? he doesn't deserve a thing from good people who aren't rapists and child abusers. my thought? your nephew should have received the death penalty for what he did.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	He would be able to either rent a house or an apartment but all of that most likely would be discussed with his parole officer. Once he is released they will be keeping close tabs on him and they will give him the resources to find a place.|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	Oh sure...send the sex offender over to my house. I'm sure my kids would love to entertain him. Glad that I don't live in Perry County.|`|AA11311567	His options vary greatly with the type of sex offender he is, and what the  laws are in Indiana.<br>  <br>  Since it is nearly a year away, some research on the part of your nephew (or you, if you want to help him) is in order.<br>  <br>  If he will be coming out with job skills it is important that he lives near a place he can get a job, yet within the confines of his restrictions.<br>  <br>  What he has done, does play a huge factor in how much help he can get, as well as what you can give him.<br>  <br>  If his offense was violent/predatory in nature and he is not remorseful or changed you might wish to keep your distance.<br>  If his offense was non predatory and he is genuinely sorry and wants to change, your help might be what keeps him productive and out of prison.<br>  <br>  If his offense involved the assault of children, you are duty bound to ensure that he stays way from children. (people often assume that a person who is a registered sex offender sexually assaulted a child, but there are a million ways a person can get on the list,  i.e.flashing an old lady etc)<br>  <br>  I don't know of any specific resources, but look around, you have almost a year.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the resources for sex offenders are few and far between.  Because of people's anger/hatred for them they are reluctant to support anything that would help them, even if it would keep them from offending again.  But there are resources.  You just have to look hard.

X3QbcIUwaa	You can do lots of things.<br>  <br>  How about, creating a home spa, where you prepare a bath for her and you with candles, wine and music. Then wearing soft robes you can present her a lovely meal (you can cook it or buy it, just present it nicely), hide small surprises all over the house for her to find (create a treasure hunt, by hiding notes in ballons she will have to break) or even use rose petals to lead her to small pressies: like a box of chocolates, a notebook, a book, flowers...<br>  <br>  Or take her out to a salon, where she can pamper herself.<br>  <br>  How about planning a night of loved films with popcorn, hot dogs, a soft blanket and lots of cuddles><br>  <br>  Or arrange for the kiddies to clean all the house, write sweet notes for her and then cook you guys a meal and leave you alone to enjoy it.<br>  <br>  Just remember: Don't do anything that you are not comfortable with because it will show and ruin your night and just remember to make her feel loved and appreciated.<br>  <br>  My husband has done all of the above and the thing that moved me more was when he read me some cute poems he wrote for me and told me why he loves me.<br>  <br>  Enjoy yourselves and well done for keeping the romance!|`|d81628eda5423a5597ca946fc724b081aa	I grew up in MA so I know what you mean by cold weather. I think I will be very happy, if my husband took me to a ski trip, rent one of those wooden lodges, take a romantic hot bath together, have the fire place burning, plan some catering of the food, then present her with a diamond bracelet, it sounds kind of expensive, you can always plus or minus some of the items I just listed.|`|SHARt1k3aa	Making a woman feel special is key!  Especially, after 23 years of marriage.  I would plan for her to have a spa day, massage, pedicure, manicure, facial, etc.  Then go and pick out a nice dress and shoes for her (if she has a friend, or you have a daughter ask for their help with this).  When she comes home, have you outfit laid out, then make reservations at a romantic restaurant.  I think that would be great!  I would love it.  And at dinner, give her a little trinket, bracelet, pendent, anything.... of course you can modify this plan according to your budget.|`|N86vHKxtaa	After 23 years, I'd think you know what she likes and what you can do.  My only suggestion would be to go "retro"... do something you both really loved when you were first dating and get a bunch of laughs about it.<br>  <br>  There's also no harm in asking her!  Unless the point is to make it a total surprise, I always like it when my partner asks me about these kind of things so I can have some input.|`|AA10350513	you need to bring a younger, well hung man in to have a go at her while you watch and cheer her on.<br>  she would like that.|`|LJoURlNYaa	Go To A Really Romantic Getaway, (Look On Internet For Places) And... WOW! This Is Amazing, Its Dreamland For Couples. The Wifey Will Love It... Trust Me|`|5Rxt5r0Raa	I think dates at home can be just as fun as going out. Make her dinner something that you know she'll love. If you can't cook order take out from a place that she really likes and have it ready when she gets home. If you drink have a nice bottle of wine and of course candle lights and music for the ambiance. Get her flowers but not roses me personally I love sunflowers. proflowers.com always has really nice floral arrangements at affordable prices. Get a sitter for the kids, because no one wants a date with kids in the background. If they are older like in high school see if they will go spend the night over a friends house. Last but not least try to not talk about finances or kids during your date.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	If I was your wife, I'd want a home cooked meal, a bouquet of my favorite flowers, and a back massage for later.  That would be just perfect.|`|kbz5S3waaa	Take her out like it's your first date all over again. Go to a nice restaurant, order some wine. Maybe go to a dinner theatre? Do you like to ski? Ski lodges have a romancey feel to them! Or do the dinner theatre thing, and get a nice hotel room, one with a hot tub.... and let the night escalate (i love hotels with hot tubs...)|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I suggest trying to send the kids to there friends house for the night so you can have privacy, that will be treat in itself. then make her a elaborate dinenr or order food in. get her flowers and some nice candles that she can put to use immedietly.

JtYNXoRdaa	It sounds as though they're trying to SAVE the marriage.  And in this day and age, where people seem to treat marriage as a disposable thing, this is a good thing.  It means they care enough to try.  And sometimes, people need outside, unbiased help to work themselves out.<br>  <br>  Since you are clearly worried and clearly love your parents, I would ask if you can talk to them together.  Then really think about what you want to say and explain your concerns to them.  They'll be able to answer you FAR better than we can - after all, it's their marriage, not ours!  <br>  <br>  Good luck, sweetie.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Frankly - it's none of your business.  You know that they are going and that's all they need to say to you about it.  If they make a life changing decision I am sure they will let you know...<br>  <br>  Not all couples go into therapy and divorce.  Some of us need to go to get things worked out...no marriage is easy - it's work!  Sometimes you need to call in a professional when you find it hard to communicate with each other.<br>  <br>  Don't sweat it - don't ask about it - let it be for now.|`|0LvWiESWaa	If they are starting counseling, it means they are both trying to save the marriage. <br>  <br>  Just ask them if they are going to split up. Tell them your concerns.|`|LJoURlNYaa	They Wont Split If They Follow The Steps Of Counseling|`|buAj586Zaa	if their having counselling its obvious their doing it to make things work .. which means their trying to make things better and hopefully things can work out !<br>  <br>  but i think you should tell them i know your both trying and are going to couple counselling but do you think you guys will split i just want to honestly know !|`|7SwfRs4Uaa	If anything, I'd kind of think that is a good sign. After all, two people who don't care, care for each other... usually (unless forced) won't take that step to saving their relationship. So look on the bright side, at least for the moment or until you find otherwise, because right now they're trying to work things out.|`|EuSV9f6uaa	lol|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I think you should ask them if they feel YOU would benefit from counseling and avoid the whole issue of THEIR marriage.<br>  <br>  A child should feel secure with his or her parents regardless of the parents' relationship.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Stay out of it for now unless they bring you into it. Safer this way. Just because they started counseling doesnt mean the marriage will end in divorce. Actually by starting counseling it signals that they both really want to save their marriage and are willing to do whatever it takes to save it. So you should be proud of them as many coupleswont do it in todays society, they would just sooner end it then fight for their beliefs. Your parents are remarkable in that theyre at least trying. Just be there for them if and when they need you but its their problem for now, not yours so stay out and this in no way i your fault either. just love them and be there for them is the best thing you can do and prayers wont hurt either. Also they should be proud that they have such a concerned child in their field too. Awesome.

jBigEy0Caa	He probably isn't the same person you remember him being.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	I'm glad I didn't!|`|aEpPt9koaa	Its possible but its not likely.|`|AA11621340	Absolutely - but don't let him get too far away for too long. <br>  <br>  Let me give you an example. When I was 16, I fell in love with someone who was just 17 years old. After a short time, he left saying he wasn't ready to be in a serious relationship & he disappeared from my life - where he went I had no idea then. I just knew he was the love of my life & cried for months. A little more than a year later, I met someone else, we dated & eventually I felt maybe I could love someone else, though not as much & in a very different way. We dated all through college & became engaged. Months before the wedding my lost love returned - he'd been in the Army - in the Vietnam War, though I never knew. He was ready to be serious then & wanted a second chance - I panicked & didn't trust him to stay. Once again, after he left, I cried my heart out, but felt that love was not enough if Icouldn't count on him.  After sending him away, I married my fiance. <br>  <br>  Fast forward more than 30 years - my marriage has had its ups & downs. One evening I read my email to find a message from my long lost love. We wrote for weeks & realized that we really had loved each other, should have tried, but now it was too late. We were both married, with almost grown-up children. We couldn't break our vows no matter how much it hurt. So we stopped writing, but separated again knowing that we could always treasure the thought that our first love had been the best - & it still was there, after all these years. It was j ust too late for us now.<br>  <br>  If you still feel so strongly about your boyfriend, find him & tell him. What have you got to lose? THe worst that could happen is he may not feel the same any more - which is whatyou might think now. BUT the best is that he really loves you too & for some reason just didn't come back looking for you. Time passes swiftly & so many things & people can get in your way. Better to find out now than to spend a lifetime wondering & regretting what might have been. Good luck!|`|LS8LcuRaaa	It's possible. If you miss him, just send him a message and ask if he wants to have a coffee with you. Maybe the spark is still there...|`|JAKKanVUaa	Anything is possible|`|AA11143998	I guess anything is possible|`|29hcn9JRaa	Not only is it possible, it is something that happens quite frequently, their are even people who rekindle a relationship with their high school sweethearts after 30 plus years. Their is just something so powerful about a first love, especially if it is a first love for both, however many first love relationships that come back together after a long absence don't always end up happy or successful, as many people tend to want to reminisce and recapture what they once upon a time had and tend to be in love with the idea of their first love, versus the person who they are today, they also may be caught up in the excitement and fun that is associated with their first love that they tend to get lost in the shuffle. So if you do reconnect with your first love, make sure you keep your expectations low and just keep it simple.|`|79wOWoM0aa	My darling Allison was not my first love, truly.

You won't die from it and let's face it, that would be the worst of all possible consequences, right? If she doesn't reciprocate, you will live. <br>  <br>  If you truly care for a person, tell them.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Is it a bad idea to give love ever?  No.  If there is one thing none of us ever get enough of, it's love.<br>  <br>  If there's one thing every one gets too much of, it's game-playing.<br>  <br>  Love requires vulnerability and risk-taking.  The thing to avoid, however, is putting pressure on him to say it if he isn't ready.  If he responds awkwardly, don't say it again.  They are just words and we all like hearing them, even if we don't know what to do with them.|`|PHYj1UPwaa	I could always tell by the way he looked at me..His heart told me before he spoke the words...Just say it, if you feel it..You will know by the other person's reaction...Don't lose the opportunity to make someone happy...Good Luck...|`|LS8LcuRaaa	If you truly love a girl you should tell her that you love her. I think it's too soon to say the 3 words after just a couple of months dating but it's ok to say it after a year or so. It really depends how both feel. <br>  <br>  I tend to wait until a guy says I love you. Guys are scared of the L word, so if they say the word first I know they usually mean it. I've never said I love you first.|`|79wOWoM0aa	Someone has to go first.<br>  <br>  It's a risky thing to throw that out there.  You risk not hearing it back.  <br>  <br>  The person who feels they are in love should say it first.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Only when you text it as ILY.  That makes it so over the top romantic...I think you should do it now!|`|3M3htWrBaa	if you really love the other then i think that it is okay to be the first to say I love you it make take her by surprise but im sure shell say she loves you to but don't say it unless you truly mean it she can tell if you mean it or not|`|ngiTDGT2aa	i think if you feel that way for someone then you should tell them. it dont matter who says it first. you shouldn't hold in how you feel, cause you would want to know  if they feel some type of way. :)|`|vBcZZRx5aa	I have this theory that if you love someone, it is usually pretty obvious if they love you back.  As a woman, I have never said I love you first.  I am older and have had several serious relationships, but I have always felt as though just because I love the person, doesn't mean that I have to say it right away.  I like men to say it first, not because of control, but just as a safety net.   I think waiting for a little while to say it is a good idea.  Also when you do say it, don't say love YA or anything that says it is not clear what your intentions are.  I once had a boyfriend first tell me he loved me for the first time over the phone while I was at a gas station filling up my car with gas.  That's really romantic NOT!

It sounds like you two are very close and that sounds great.  If she wants more, she will let you know.  I say don't push it.  Let the friendship lie where it is and be happy for it.  She is moving in six months and if there is more to this relationship than you are suggesting, she will let you know wherever she goes.  In the meantime, stay focused on your own goals and life so that IF she comes into your life in a more serious way, you will have the means to have your own place and job.  <br>  I like this girl already because she isn't going to have sex with you just for fun like many girls will.  She is holding her own and I admire that.  Be patient.  Be a good friend.  See what comes of it.  Just keep being yourself..|`|AA11108542	your in the friend zone move on|`|aLajoXnRaa	well i think you should jst ask her to give you a straight up answer because that is what you deserve. go up, and be upright with her, and tell her that you really need an answer. and that should do it. now if you dont want to do that, then idk i think you should jst leave the situation alone dont try to rush or push things through. If its gonna take time, then be patient and wait...if you want.<br>  so if you really want then yeah do try...jst dont sound so eager...you know.

I be happy with the present arrangement.|`|0rAgtGNgaa	no and even though there is a court ordered visitation doesnt mean he has to get them everytime.  But I do think that once a week is irritating.

If you haven't signed anything saying he must have them overnight once a week then its yours and your sons choices. <br>  But if you go against him on this once a week thing then he may take you to court to have custody or more visitation. This all depends on your situation though. If he is a bad father and you have reason for your children not to see him you may want to take him to court and fight for them not to see their father. <br>  I am only fifteen but my parents are divorced and i have had to fight in court many times and have learned all about the rights of fathers to see their children. <br>  hope it all works out.:)|`|m4sLy7cWaa	there is no law saying that he can get them..unless you go to court and the judge says so.

udPtqagzaa	This is really sweet, and I'm glad you're getting more confident. I think that the Facebook commenting is a great way to start, and it'll give you something to talk about when you have the confidence to speak to her in real life.<br>  <br>  However, I will say that the comment should have more of a purpose than 'hi'. If you're in any of her lessons, ask if there's any homework that you've missed.. she'll know you want to talk but it'll be far more subtle and friendly. And far, far less awkward.

d7bJIgqlaa	Why do you have to have a BEST friend?  Why can you not just have a lot of good friends?  Or if you like to have a best friend, have two.  The more the merrier, right.  Before you tell her that you have a new best friend imagine how you would feel if two weeks down the road your new best friend told you that she has a new one and doesn't need you to be her bestest anymore.  That would really be a bummer, right?  So, be a good friend to all of your friends.  Sometimes boring isn't so bad.|`|GBSnBbWiaa	You might not want to do that! Because you will regret it!!

The old girl must see you in that way, so it will hurt her so much when you tell her you don't want to be best friends.<br>  <br>  You cant just ditch a person because you like someone better. Its not like having an affair, then breaking the news to your husband. Never tell her that you don't want to be best friends, because you are BORED with her. Its horrible. What kind of person does that make you? <br>  <br>  Go do something, like shopping or a sleepover with both the girls, i find things are much more livelier when your in a three. It'll be fun, and who knows what will happen in the future?|`|s53dSt7Kaa	thats not how best friends work, Its not like having a boyfriend. you don't split up and find a new, better one.<br>  just invite the new girl to hang out with you two, or say you've made a new friend.<br>  i have to say, if you can only handle having one friend at a time, thats a liiiiittle odd.|`|MYO2k9EUaa	That might hurt her feelings a bit, to say she is boring.

hGF6i3Eyaa	It's OK. He probably just needs someone to stand in for him while he is hunting and fishing. Pick me!|`|kbz5S3waaa	Don't you hate it? It's been like that for a while with my husband too, just talk with him and tell him you don't feel like you're "enjoyed" like you should be.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Put on a bear costume....that might rev his engine!|`|1HTRWrawaa	You need to answer a few questions. Has he always been like this sexually? Or did he go from wanting it all the time, to the way he is now? What is he like in bed? Does he take his time and make love to you? Or does he get down to business and just have sex? Do you always wait for him to come to you for sex? Or half of the time do you go to him. When you try to get something going with him, does he respond and have sex with you or does he act like he's not interested and just wants to watch his tv program?<br>  <br>  Men get tired of always having to be the one to start the romance and really like it when the woman takes charge some times. It's a real turn on for them. If sex is always the same and nothing ever changes, both men and women get bored and lose interest in sex. You have to spice it up and do the unexpected. Unfortunately it's usually the woman who has to do that. Men are lazy in that department and usually cheat if sex gets boring or just get depressed and do without.<br>  <br>  You also didn't mention how old your husband is. As men get older their sex drive goes down. A woman's goes up and are at their peak around 35. <br>  <br>  Talk to your husband and find out why your sex drives are so different. Maybe the two of you can work together to make it more enjoyable for the both of you.|`|RtkB46peaa	Ask him this as sincerely and calmly as you can:  "Do I nag you or complain too much?"<br>  <br>  Don't listen to his actual answer, because he's an idget if he just comes out and says it.  Read his face.  You'll see it in his eyes.<br>  <br>  Then ask him "Do you know how happy I am with you and that I appreciate you very much?"<br>  <br>  Men are more likely to want to be intimate with their wives when they feel close to them, and when they feel appreciated and respected.|`|8PDzaAJcaa	Have you two had any problems other than this? Has it always been this way? Are you having sex at all? If not, he may be depressed. My husband and I went through this after I had a hysterectomy, its like I was broken or something and it freaked him out a little, I have also heard of this type of thing happening after a couple has had a baby. I would talk to him about it, he may just have some mental things to work out or maybe he has a physical problem and he is afraid to share it with you.  Good Luck|`|xdOgQPEkaa	probably just bored. things can get a little routine after 3 years<br>  <br>  do something to spice things up and see what happens|`|qc1fasaeaa	Maybe he is in a slump. Some men have ups and downs in their sexual appetite. How old is he? Maybe you should just talk to him about it, or try and spice things up in the bedroom. Maybe he is getting bored with the same ol' same ol', and you should try new things. It is important to keep your sex life active, especially during your first years of marriage. That connection and that bond needs to be strong between you two.|`|H0vicK8Kaa	What is barely?..like once a month? then be concerned.. but if it's like once a week then it's not that bad...<br>  <br>  I've been married 5 yrs and we average 2-3 times a week.<br>  We just had a baby and still have the same routine..|`|tG1vTi0Daa	Fck him while hes sleeping.

People go through their own times, with themselves when they maybe aren't feeling good about themselves, or things in their life is so stressful, it's the last on their mind.<br>  <br>  Speak to him, see what's going on,<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|CF1R0TPvaa	One of the following:<br>  1.  You're more than 30% over your ideal weight<br>  2.  You're annoying and you bug him, you nag him and/or hang on him looking for attention.<br>  3.  He's gay<br>  4.

kfM7ppWpaa	Well, the only reason your parents are strict on you is because they don't want you to make bad decisions at this point in your life. Your very young and still have lots to learn about relationships and dating. I have noticed though over the years that girls that have strict parents, especially pretty girls like yourself, tend to be the most rebellious. I think you should break it off with this guy and date boys your own age. He doesn't have a job or a car anyways! Sounds like a bum to me....|`|ANpzT9HJaa	well if you have to stress your self out to be with him then you need to let go cause you are way too young and beautyful to have to go through some thing im goin though rite now in my life . i just left the guy cause this guy was like 25 and im just 18 . do whats right for you|`|gMYoi210aa	hes TOO what do u call it? ummm he thinks that you are his, BUT that wouldnt be a very good guy, i know i would respect my girl and understand the things she has to do, i her life|`|TnjNnVNraa	well first off all you should explain to him that you have a life and there can be a time for ya could talk doesn't have to be all day till you fall asleep and tell him you like him and you know he like you but  just tell him to back off a little and try to talk to him about getting a job...|`|UImdKfUSaa	i don't mean to judge but if  hes 20 and youre 15 it's illegal for him to date you not even kidding ask anyone it is truly illegal i think u should gete out of the relationship asap.SORRY!!!|`|DMIB1CU8aa	he is super clingy lol! you know who you should dATE?? ME! lol, on a serious note though there is a (sexual) consent law that allows anyone "16" or older to date someone and do it with them up to 5 years difference but, at the same time a sagitory rape charge can only be filed with "seduction of a minor" so if it was your choice and he didn't have to "seduce" you then its a slap on the wrist for him.. For you idiots out there though its called don't tell your office buddy your doing it with a 15 year old.. LOL how you supposed to get caught if you "actually" don't tell anyone.. And Bianca, every guy wants sex sooner or later.. if he wants sex why wouldn't he text you all the time that means your one his mind a lot and when they get controlling that means they "want" you for curtain things, I'm a guy I should know. Look he's 20 and has completely different views on relationships a 20 year old is looking to fool around why do you think that the average person to have a child is 19-25?? did you also know that 80% of cases of a 16 year old girl getting pregnant is from a guy 17-19 sometimes 20 a guy is at his sexual prime at around 20 so just be careful. Also, make sure your dad doesn't have a gun cause I'd be more afraid of them "killing" him. LOL  Bianca feel free to e-mail me at, keolamelhorn@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  All I can say is he is way to clingy controlling and old for you, but love is a strong compeling thing which will blindly lead people to what  they believe is resolve for them. If you think it will work out with you and him then keep dating him and, "YOU HAVE TO BREAK IT TO YOUR PARENTS!" though.<br>  <br>  Sincerely, (K)
wpi36XBAaa	He will cheat again. How do I know this? You, and his actions tell me so.<br>  Here, I will explain.<br>  1. He isn't being honest with you, even when asked directly. He was only honest when too drunk to lie?<br>  2. He doesn't accept the responsibility for his actions - "...Blamed me for our separation, stating that I was exaggerating..." nor does he understand that you have every right to feel hurt by his actions. He is not remorseful for what he has done.<br>  3. He doesn't respect you - "...Tried to manipulate his way back into the relationship with lies..." <br>  4. He's unwilling to remove the opportunity to cheat again - "...he is not willing to cut loose his relationship with the girl's mother who was the one who...invited him over... knowing i was not in town..."<br>  So he doesn't accept that he did the wrong thing, hasn't made any effort to change the situation and blames you? He will do it again, because to him, its just not his fault. <br>  If nothing has changed, nothing will. Is that good enough for you?|`|wXaGIPSPaa	The pain is overwhelming.  But no one can tell you what to do. You need to research this website:  www.truthaboutdeception.com<br>  and www.womansavers.com<br>  Tigress Luv said, "Love grows where trust is laid, <br>  love dies where trust is betrayed."|`|2aI0UmhWaa	forgive him not 7 but 77 times|`|dEFap0Zaaa	Once they cheat.......they will repeat.

He took it up cause she was easy to get.He may think you are good enough to not make an effort to go hunting,but obviously if it falls into his lap he will gladly take up with it. I wouldn't let him live with me. I'd probably make him work to get the easy stuff back. His ex isn't gonna want him back,she probably just wanted to see if she still had it or not.|`|E84iCYH2aa	Simply dump him. He is just trying to set his foot on both the boats. May be he misses some excitement in your relationship which he got in the past one and tries and catches up with it. Chances are that even if he severes ties with his ex hez gonna start a new one. Hes a sure cheat and so is his ex and family. Please do not even think twice before bidding him adieu. I know it hurts initially but thats much better than the pain that you would have to go through whole life adjusting with this cheater.|`|jUS9ATdMaa	Once a cheat always a cheat.You will never be able to leave for a few days again because this will always be in the back of your mine.Leave him go and go find a real man that will love you and only you.|`|sgkvXvNTaa	I know your heart is broken and rightfully so.

ALOT!<br>  <br>  Do you think that its really worth staying in a relationship with a man that doesn't have the decency to even tell you the truth on his own?  Come on... seriously... if he's not telling you the truth, he's lying and hiding.  <br>  <br>  he's only sorry he was caught... he lied to you about it over and over, never told you the truth.  trust me, he's no good....<br>  <br>  If I were you, I wouldn't give him the option to take time to tell me the truth.  If he's not giving you the truth now.... he's definitely not going to tell you the truth anytime soon.  Listen... he's not being honest, and thats all got to do with him and his own morals.  a person that doesn't believe other people are deserving of the truth is a person that feels they are somehow better than you, they think they can fool you. are you a fool? i hope not.|`|AA10197672	Leave the jerk - this man will never be the man you want. You were gone for 10 days and he went for dinners and cheated on you? How are you supposed to trust him in your life? Never leave him alone? Thats not a life you should be looking forward to. And pls remember, once a cheater always a cheater. If he was able to cross that line once, what makes you think he wont again?....
qSSiV0mmaa	Yes, it can hold you back.  I am single, almost 30 & I have dated a lot.  I think there is a difference between being picky & know what you will & will not accept in a person.  I use to only want to date tall white guys.  That was so unfair to other guys.  I will only date guys who are the same religion as me because my religion is very important to me.  Other then that, looks don't really matter to me anymore.  I completley understand what you say when you have to be attracted to someone.  I agree.  But different people are attracted to different things. My last boyfriend had a big beer belly & was really hairy.  But I was so attracted to him.  I am not attracted to guys that most people would say are good looking.  I just have different tatste.  I remeber when  a hispanic guys asked me out.  I said yes even though he wasn't a white guy & was not as tall as the guys I was use to dating.  When we were talking I found out that he was not even hispanic.  He went to the same church as me.  He was great.  But if I would have just judged him by his appearance, I probably would not have gone out with him & got to know such a great person. I guess it is also important not to judge a book by its cover.  Just take a chance & try dating someone different.  See how it works out.  You should stil not sacrifice important things like values, but looks are not everything.  Good luck.|`|4kfljeIGaa	Short answer: yes.  <br>  <br>  With more elaboration: being picky is NOT entirely bad if it prevents you from getting hooked up with an unemployed bum with no front teeth and the odor of rotting pork chops.  However, if you refuse to even consider dating anyone who does not look exactly like Alec Baldwin, then you really will be quite limited.  Or you could actually wind up with an Alec Baldwin look-alike who has no job and smells like month-old pork chops.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line: don't waste your time dating people you would never want to "be with" romantically, but also try to keep an open mind!|`|jJZz2U8Gaa	I just think that being too picky would help you overlook great things in a person. If you say that you hate dark hair on a guy, but there's the perfect guy for you with dark hair, you will never know he would be great for you because you've already ruled it out because of his hair color.|`|uLHtXibRaa	Picky dont help but then it narrows your field and lets you decide what you want..if thats how you want to date.. I find being picky means i get no dates..as if i dont ask i dont get asked..it depends if you really want to be single or not if you dont then you cant be to picky..every man you find if you are to picky will have a drawback..|`|PmaB839Naa	Being picky now that is a good question. What are you looking for? Your heart will tell you. Guys that look great are not always the way to go. It is what is in them and how they are when you are together that counts. You will know it.|`|ee4678869d4897b2132614f58b4c0ecfaa	Yes being picky can ruin your dating life AND social life.  I know first hand from experience.  If someone approaches you, at least give him a chance before you say no and take off running.|`|TQgdB1sCaa	I agree that you must be physically attracted to someone for sexuall thoughts to come into play right away. How ever getting to know someone even as innocently as a friend, can later show you that you are sexually attracted to their personalitly almost. It isn't a bad thing to know what you want though. Set standards, he's out there somewhere. <br>  Good luck!|`|hl0iK2nsaa	being picky can definitely hold you back.<br>  everyone has flaws and sometimes you just have to live with it.<br>  my advice is to lower your standards and start dating as just friends .<br>  then if you're comfortable with the person take it up a level.|`|PumDOQC9aa	being picky doesn't mean anything bad you just want the best for you  .im picky myself i like guys who have goals. when they are not the one for me i just move on, it never stop me from holding back

zNuZm4K6aa	There are only a few flowers nowadays that are available all year long that actually change price from season to season.  Roses are now available all year long b/c they are being grown in Ecuador & flown in; they are about the same price all year, so don't let them overcharge you for those or any of the following flowers, which should stay the same all year:<br>  Calla Lilies, Stargazer lilies, Casablanca lilies, asiatic lilies, carnations, daisies, Stephanotis, roses, spray roses<br>  <br>  Some that are seasonal to spring & summer that are available in other months, but for an increase in price might be:<br>  tulips, hydrangeas, ranunculus<br>  <br>  Some that are only available in spring summer months at all are:<br>  peonies, gardenias, magnolias<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|bf6K6uubaa	i suggest calling a different florist (one that you were not considering) and asking them...i know that flowers are flown in fromall over and in the winter they may be harder to get depending on the type of flower you are using...|`|884v4VhGaa	If the florist raises the price substantially. We told our florist not to select the type of flower before she bought them (i.e. week of) and we're still paying about as much as if we'd selected a specific kind of flower, which might or might not be in season. It is their job to be able to tell you what kind of flower to use for a given time of year. A professional response to your situation is to inform you of any price changes and to offer to make another appointment to discuss substitutions. You might end up having to pay to do the extra consultation though. (unlikely, but possible).<br>  <br>  On the other hand, most flowers are flown in from overseas (that's why local flowers cost so much more). The growing seasons are entirely different there, and while flowers still aren't all year-round, there's a lot of options, and there are a large number of flowers which are year round. When you went through the flower list did you pick seasonal flowers? If not, then you probably will pay about the same or less.

Whatever the issue is that she is bringing up, is probably something that concerns her and she wishes for you to correct.<br>  <br>  I know that it may not seem this way now, but she really does love you and wants the best for you. Once you are out of her house and she isn't breathing down your neck all the time, you will slowly start to realize that she just tried to do her best for you.|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	try not doing whatever you do that pisses her off. that way, she'll have nothing to complain about. ever thought of that? i didn't think so.......|`|GOSMZMpwaa	omg same with my mom <br>  its pretty stupid sometimes. <br>  some of the things your doing may be annoying her<br>  or maybe she is sad that your growing up so fast :P|`|reAtqf0Maa	because she is worried about you. at your age you can face peer pressure, drugs, alcohol, and sexual activity. she wants ti make sure that this doesn't happen. she is protecting you from all the bad things that could happen to you. you should actual thank her (i know you don't want to but if she didnit do this you could wind up smoking while having a baby and your future would go down the drain!) (god forbid that that would happen) because she is helping you.<br>  <br>  you hate it but when your a grown up you will do the same with your kids so they will be ok. and when you look back you will realize you had the guidance you need to belp you|`|bcf393e4db41afbc89350db8fced8a1aaa	Toya, parents don't like starting arGuments.  They're just looking after you (their little "baby," so to speak.  They want what's best for you.    You may not believe me, but when you look back you'll say to yourself, "Hey, they were looking out for me so that nothing happens to me---I love them for that."  You'll probably or should thank them for it.  Mark my words Toya.  You'll see where I'm coming from.  Just be patient!!!
pVnUhYLQaa	Why do you have to make her understand anything? it's your life. She'll just have to get over it (and she will). <br>  <br>  I wouldn't tell her about anything you do from here on out though.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	If you are free to make your own decisions and form your own opinions about sex, then you also have to accept the fact that your mom is free to make her own decisions and form her own opinions about sex.<br>  <br>  She knows you don't live in the 18th century. She just wanted better for you than you sleeping with a series of guys before you find the one to marry. It's heartbreaking business, and she doesn't want you to suffer.|`|qNdsNhgOaa	Your Mom is being unreasonable.  Religion set aside she should be happy that you are open and honest with her about your personal life.  Unfortunately, there probably isn't anything you can do to get her to agree with you or see things your way.  All you can do is respect her opinion and she should respect yours.  Best wishes ;)|`|hDrDr4tPaa	well its your life! she cant control it! <br>  just dont try to explain an ything to her!<br>  shes gonna have to get over it!|`|Yi5Rgauoaa	You can't make her understand. All you can do is reassure he that you have not slipped into the depths of hell...lol I know how hard it can be dealing with crazy catholic mothers. My sympathies :) She is never going to be ok with you following your own path. It seems like you want to be open with your mother but I don't think she is perfectly happy assuming you are a innocent catholic girl. Why spoil her dreams and your day. Just live your life the way you want to and try not to share the things you know she will disprove of.|`|iIU4u0AIaa	Well that is true it isn't the 18th century. She is going to have to understand. Everything doesn't go the way people thing is will go. It was bound to happen anyways, your getting older and you need to put your foot down. Parents now days don't understand that things are different and that the only way to make them understand is by putting your foot down and telling them that your getting big and your decision are your decisions, no disrespect to them. Once your an adult you make your own decisions, obviously respect your parents but let them understand. They will get over it. Talk to your mom and communicate with her and tell her that a mother shouldn't call her daughter a tramp, while supposedly she is trying to be a good mother, well lets just say she isn't by saying your a tramp. A good mother suppose to be supportive and understanding. GOOD LUCK.|`|okxuIuExaa	It's Your Life Not your Mother's You will Make Mistakes but they will be your doing... Don't let your mother Rule over you... Sex before Marriage is just normal Many people want to explore themselves... Just don't explore too much that will lead to diseases or worse... You have a right to your life every person I know has a thing called Free Agency... That mean no one can really control you... Because you are in charge of your own action's Religion has a point in this because your mother is just messing with your head you are not a big sinner but if you feel that you are then go ahead search through religion... Like i said Free Agency is also apart of religion and I am sure your mother would fine that to be true... Like i said no one person can control another life... You will make choices and you will regret them or learn to live with them... You life is your life it too the fullest...^_^ Be Proud to be you... Be Proud there is still another day... Glad i could help you with this

Like, let's say you both love running. It's easier to laugh and joke about something you already know lots about, so focus a lot on running.<br>  <br>  Don't try and be cute with your little pickup lines. It's demoralizing to men, and it only provokes a smart-alec remark from most women.<br>  <br>  Girls:<br>  <br>  Talk to them about anything, except how fat you are, or your ex-boyfriends, or the latest gossip. Most guys are more into talking to you if it's something they're comfortable with.<br>  <br>  If guys just plain out tell me I'm cute, or come onto me with some sort of witty joke, then it's great. However, I think pickup lines just show a man is desperate, and not interested in ME, but more in either my body, or the sex, or just plain out saying "I got a girl."|`|Uu1wTzXDaa	What do you like to talk to guys about?<br>  Anything that keeps them interested, but keeps you interested also.

Fsr2Rofzaa	seems to me you have a "kid" view on things.  The reason is say this is b/c an adult would not use the term "assclownery" Also my motto is Things aren't always as they appear.  If a business was doing well for 30 years why is it so wrong to try to run the business under "new managment"  So what if your uncle lent HIS money to a friend, myob!|`|gPlUDaRoaa	Yup,i would tell them.|`|VWZPAWUMaa	Yes, if you want to worry them about your uncle. No, if you think a little bit through; it's your uncle's money after the settlement, right? So, if your parents already gave your uncle his part, I think he can do whatever he wants with it. On the other hand, if he still owns your parents money, do tell them.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Tell tell tell.  Your duty of loyalty is to your parents, not this dropkick.<br>  <br>  He sounds like he's got some sort of gambling problem, together with all sorts of other issues.  Yr parents have to learn to leave him to sink or swim because propping him up is simply enabling him.  This might be part of that lesson.|`|sgx8c6Coaa	Yes, your parents should know. The business that your parents sold was mostly theirs, and since he's family, they should definitely know so maybe they can get him some help.|`|h7igZipgaa	Yes you have to tell your parents!|`|AA11041425	Yes, definitely.  Your parents seem to be bending over backwards for your Uncle, who keeps making mistakes.  They may need to put stipulations in writing about what he can and cannot do with the money they loan him if he continues to ask them for help.|`|PpakisLAaa	man ur rich dont worry about it i would love to have that kind of $ let ur unc live his life
PFwhxpZ4aa	No don't listen to the first person who called you a p@$$#. For most women it's hard to achieve an orgasm vaginally. It is easier thru oral sex bc there are a lot of nerves in that area that when done right can be a very pleasing experience. Make sure she is really turned on before you start bc that adds to the pleasure. Something that really helps is if you do a star figure with your tounge bc this technique pleasures most of the clitoris. Don't be boring about it either change it up a bit and make sure you read her bodily signs, for instance if she seems to be really liking something then keep at it, if she seems to be just laying there then change it up a bit. Once she achieves her orgasm(s) then you can have sex and she might be able to have an orgasm vaginally. It also helps for you to play with her clitoris while you thrust bc this is also very pleasurable to women. It just takes practice. How are you suppose to perfect your technique if you don't practice? So make sure you practice A LOT! Good luck :)|`|fc1n9vBjaa	If you're willing to learn and not let ego stand in the way then that's a good sign, ask your fiance exactly what she wants you to do, or if she wants to try something new, it's considerate of you to want to learn ways to please her, that's the key to a good sex life, there's no place for being selfish.|`|79wOWoM0aa	3 hours is not unheard of but is completely unrealistic for a regular go-around.  <br>  <br>  The best way to learn is to encourage her to coach you.  To be communicative about what's good and what's not.<br>  <br>  Other than doing her myself and reporting my findings, that's the best advice I have for you.|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	Midnight, in my experience giving good oral to a woman means to take your time slowly licking and sucking everything.  Every woman knows what sets her off, so ask her - if she is open, she will tell you.    Good Luck|`|UINoUgbWaa	Do you cook?<br>  What does she like to eat?<br>  Cook something light. A nice sweet dessert.<br>  Then a hot bubble bath and dry her with an Egyptian towel. Then give her a sexy massage with scented massage oil.

Concentrate on what she likes and do more of that...it takes time to learn your partner's body and this is something you both should participate in. She already took your ring...so you must be doing something right :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck.
W0633l18aa	I would say do it, i hardly ever see my godmother i dont think it is that much of a ocmmitment to be honest<br>  <br>  I mean you must care for the kid on some level so just get it over with and try and be more tolerant|`|09DE4NG3aa	What exactly is expected of a godmother in your culture?  If it is just a name, then maybe you could just accept it.  If it is raising the girl in the event her parents die, then say no.  You need to make a decision how to handle this yourself.  You already told your step sister no, now you could just say to this girl, don't call me nina, I'm not your godmother, I'm just your Aunty.
mNn7MyaPaa	so i actually read it and i think she thinks of you as her best friend. but if you want to try to go out with her, i would try. i kinda act the same with people who i like but idk, just go for it, i guess, and tell her that u like her when u ask her out. trust me, when some people ask the other people out they sometimes are just desperate to go out with anybody and saying that u like her says that ur not desperate.|`|YWxGVp8Baa	ya shes sounds like  she likes you man just tell her how you feel and if shes says i only like you as a friend then she is a ho or you are like a brother to her<br>  <br>  but ya just tell her ;]|`|EZHZW7QFaa	Are you blind??

16ffc7ceffd030636adf5aede378a4abaa	Talking dirty is actually really easy. One trick is don't think but just answer the question with exactly how you feel.<br>  <br>  The next time he asks you that question you can always say "I want it bad" "I want you inside me now"<br>  <br>  Next step would be to start talking dirty to him and ask him questions. Things like "oh i'm so wet" and other things along those lines work. One easy way to see other people doing the same thing is to just go online to a free porn site and listen in on what they are saying.|`|igztwLPBaa	(all the answers ive read to this question ...plain ol' stupidity)<br>  <br>  Ok don't panic..i will not call myself a Pro..but i def.. learned a few  things months ago because i realized my bf of 3 yrs was Really into it. to be honest if u catch a few porn vidz..u can mimic a few lines you'll catch the females saying..and sooner than you know..u will be talking dirty too...i do not see it as being a slut (dumbest thing I read below also) if that's your boyfriend...you are doing your job by trying to please him.._hope this helps|`|OepO491daa	haha that'd be reall funny if he said the wrong name.|`|8jBGhsWPaa	While your having sex wisper in hes ear all the things you want to do to him.

You may be the most serious relationship he has, or he could just be shy about it. i love my boyfriend with all my heart, and sometimes im a bit shy , but im not embarrassed at all by him. he doesnt know how to balance out being your boyfriend and being one of the guys.. but he'll learn. dont worry about it|`|MRUVo6tnaa	Guys are more cool and not so emotional in front of others, especially in front of buddies.<br>  <br>  As long as he doesn't act like you're not together I wouldn't bother. <br>  <br>  If he starts like acting like you are there with him by accident and keeps the gf secret, I would bother|`|51zQW8l2aa	well he do love u,but u must let time take its place..he is maybe not used to telling in front of his friends he loves u...he is a guy..u should be more understanding...some guys they are not shy but some of them are..just keep on telling him I LOVE YOU in public..maybe one day he will tell u back|`|SVPFyBNaaa	no i think he's just embarassed about being so emotional. don't worry about it. i probably wouldn't openly say "i love you too" either. unless you've been going out for a while.|`|GzDUVMYEaa	he is not embarrased of u its jus when he is with his mates he wont say he loves u bak because he friends would take the mick out of him for being femine....dont worry most boys are like this|`|K7vCWru6aa	No..guys are just embarassed of seeming whipped or feminine..|`|V12HSfNAaa	yes unfortunately he is. I know you like him but you should dump him. that's about the only advice I can give you, but still confront him about it. good luck|`|RXvBMuCVaa	start talking to one of his mates when your all out together you will  soon see if he likes you if he gets jelous or not,|`|u3LYyVOMaa	YES|`|XhWoAGYAaa	yes i do, sorry. you should dump him.|`|1613506c4d9c8e75054ffdcc3607c11daa	There are 2 different possibilites for your problem. Now im guesssing your under the age of 17 and your boyfriend is your age. The first possibility is that he is young and as a young guy you are not supposed to have a girlfriend and your supposed to be "free" and your not supposed to fall in love. And he just feels the presure and is scared to look like a *ussy in front of people. The second possibility is he may love you and the wy you look but doesnt thnk that other people think your as attractive as he thinks you are. I hope that helps.|`|1IABIB07aa	it really depends. i had the same problem with my boyfriend and was really hurt because i  jumped to conclusions. the first month or so he wouldn't talk to me at school much. and he wouldn't show any affection. of course when we were alone he was the opposite. i thought the same exact thing. i asked him about it in a casual way and he explained he was only shy. turns out that was true. after about a month it changed. he is completely comfortable now and kisses, hugs, and tells me he loves me at school, it only took time. so if you guys haven't been going out very long, then maybe that is his problem, if not then it could be something else. maybe ask him or wait it out.|`|VM4i78gTaa	Easy way to find out if he is just acting like a *** to be cool to his friends or not is to stop doing what your doing. <br>  <br>  treat him like he treats you but all the time, not mean just aloof and if he cares he will ask why and you make him wait till his friends are around then answer him. Ask if he enjoyed being treated like a second hand individual and he will probably get his *** in line. If does not then you don't need his BS and go find someone who is more interested then you then what his friends think. <br>  <br>  P.s If you all are active sexually then  cutting off the supply till he gets his act together is a good idea :) and if not just tell him if he can't treat you the same way all the time to go kiss the mirror or your *** whichever :)<br>  <br>  BTW the guy above me saying stop out of respect for him is a idiot. If he can't be a MAN and say how he feels then he aint worth a damn to you.|`|WQhV4Amgaa	NO OF COURSE HE'S NOT! he just doesn't feel comfortable saying "i love you" around his friends. it makes him feel im masculine. he's just not ready to do that in front of his friends yet. i personally think you should stop saying it for a month or so, out of respect for him. that's what love is all about. trust and respect. if either of those are lacking this is not a good relationship. feel free to e-mail me for more advice. i'm obitoman17@yahoo.com.|`|qZVlDHBTaa	If it bothers you that much you should talk to him about it and let him know how you feel. I really don't think he is embarassed of you, it's just a macho guy thing.|`|99f1a613b8626879545c17ad14f841a8aa	No not because of you but just embarrassed because he doesn't know how he's supposed to act around you when he thinks his mates might be able to see.|`|ulsIrphnaa	its not that hes embarrassed of you its just that hes not used to doing it and is shy about it|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	As a guy, I can tell you that we can be like this. It's not b/c we're embarrassed of you, though. I probably come off this way at times.<br>  <br>  I am uncomfortable witnesses public displays of affection. Therefore I don't like to be too lovey dovey or affectionate in public with a girlfriend either b/c while you probably shouldn't care, people notice. They judge you or are uncomfortable b/c of you or maybe just like ogle at you.<br>  <br>  You can try to test this by seeing how affectionate he's willing to be around a group of mutual friends. Like at a small house party/get together kind of thing. I know for me, I will not be as affectionate in that type of situation as I will be when we're behind closed doors, but if she comes up and puts her arm around me, then I'm not gonna freak out or think that's weird.|`|Ki90Irkcaa	I completely understand where you are coming from because I experience this with my partner. My partner does not show me affection in public. I mean the rated G kind, my partner doesn't even reach to hold my hand. The thing is you cant say that its not that big of a deal if it means a lot to you. Some people require good cooks, or someone handy, or they are really attracted to people that have dark features, and you and I happen to like people that are affectionate and that show it at all times, not just when you're at home alone. It will make you feel that he is ashamed of you a little bit. I would just talk to him about it, maybe saying I love you and being to lovey dovey can be too much for him. Try rubbing his back every nowandthen or a light kiss on the back of the neck or something like that. If you guys are under 25, good luck. Most people are still trying to figure out their dating style so I wouldn't take it personal. He could still be very much immature. But the best thing to do is communicate about it without getting emotional or whining. That way he will stay tuned into what you are saying, and if public displays of affection are important to you and his behavior doesn't change then you will have to adjust him out of your life so that you can find someone that is more compatible. Good luck!|`|AA12231679	I don't think he is embarrassed by you, but may still be quite unsure how to be with you in front of others, especially with friends who knew him before he was with you. Try and be a little less touchy feely in public and let him relax and learn how to respond.<br>  <br>  Enjoy the loveliness he shows you in private!|`|AA10874773	some people are not comfortable with public displays of affection, no matter how they feel, or their gender.  it just depends on the person.  he probably doesnt mean anything by it, he's just uncomfortable with it.|`|PumDOQC9aa	you tell him  that you love him and he doesn't say anything back? that's just wrong .maybe it seems like hes doesn't feel the same way as him what is his probem and how he feels about you|`|YXdKmEKjaa	Maybe he's embarresed to be 'emotional around his friends.<br>  <br>  Its a boy thing =D|`|sCCjAKllaa	He doesn't want to like that while his friends are there. You should just learn to keep that kind of talk between you two.|`|892YhtPCaa	boys are a bit weird, they think its unmacho to say 'i love you'|`|MvIEWl4paa	NO. def. do not dump him, and he is NOT embarrassed to be around you.  Guys can be like that just because they dont want people to think that they are being "controlled" guys think a lot differently than girls.  Guys dont like conflict, and they think that if your all lovey dovey in the hallway it will draw attention to yourself. ive been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years, and we are in high school too.  At first he seemed the same way, but they grow out of it.  DO NOT DUMP HIM GIRL!|`|Xj1l4vRJaa	Okay... Giving an age range with these sort of questions really does offer a lot more insight to the situation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Given your structure of question, I'm guessing you're in school, I can't tell if it's Junior High or High School; but I'm going to venture that it's Junior High -I'm making this estimation based on the fact that, yes, he's embarassed.<br>  <br>  Before going further, if you're graduating from high school, and you're dealing with this, he needs a major maturity adjustment.<br>  <br>  That said, if you're in junior high, yes, he's embarassed; but that's honestly normal. Guys aren't emotionally equipped to deal with that stuff in public yet, they don't know how to deal with it when their friends tease them about it later, and they will. Don't be getting too attached, because frankly if he's not ready for that sort of thing, then he's really just not ready to have a real relationship, and he won't be for a while.<br>  <br>  If you're in high school.... you need a new boyfriend.<br>  <br>  If you're graduated from HS, then you need to find an entirely new way of meeting men, lol.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.

DrzuDOD6aa	Put a date on the website, and then a couple weeks before, anyone who hasn't responded, have you maid of honor call them (it can be awkward and pressuring for guests if the bride calls).|`|JtEBaOdjaa	I was going to suggest everything you have written here. (Minus the email. I wouldn't bother with that.  That's putting a little too much effort into it.  And don't forget to call those who don't have internet.<br>  Sounds like you are on top of it.  Not a big deal, no stressing.<br>  You were going to have to call people anyways.  There's always a few people who lose their invites/forget to send it back<br>  Good luck!|`|bf6K6uubaa	i say put the date on the website which is something you could have done regardless of forgetting to add it to invites...also wait a while and people who do not rsvp in a timely fashion either are not going to attend or assume you know they are going...so casually ask them...or better yet have a bridesmaid call them to ask that way they dont feel obligated to say yes to you if they are really not showing|`|wU3mgjAKaa	IMO, I would add the note onto your website and call or email those who have not responded by April 1. This way you can do your best to make sure everyone is notified about the RSVP date.|`|JERUmEFzaa	I suggest you do everything. Because I bet that everyone would want to go to your wedding so there won`t be many to chase down :-) You have a lot of time on your hands before the wedding so maybe you can call the people sometime next week who don`t respond. Good luck :)<br>  <br>  Congrats on the wedding!|`|q8eue7CRaa	I would do a combo - put the RSVP on the website and call people a week or so before your cut-off date to get answers. Trust me, even with an RSVP, people will STILL not respond and you'll be chasing down people regardless!|`|b1xQKDEraa	either of the suggestions above are good, if the cut off date isnt too important, then just wait until nearer the cut off date and then start chasing up and explain why your chasing up.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	id double team it.  like, put something on the website, but then send out an email just in case no one goes to the website. (idk how much traffic you have on it)<br>  <br>    but your ALWAYS going to end up calling people.  there are always those stragglers  who dont send it in on time.  in fact, one wedding my family was invited to, our invite originally got lost in the mail and we didnt get it untill the cut off date.  **** happens.  so id say put it on your website, then email everyone you can, and word of mouth should take care of the rest.  then you still have the 2 or three months to play around with calling people
np5VgFelaa	The only thing that you can do right now is be there for her. Tell her how much you care about her and that you just want her to be able to live her life happily. Keep bringing up the idea of the therapist--it is essential that she talk to a professional during this hard time--and say that both you and her birth mother would want her to move on with her life and be happy and healthy.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
KgKAFvEBaa	If the lawyer feels it is in his best interest to go, then go, otherwise you might get subpoenaed.  Don't feel intimidated by his wife...if you end up marrying him, you'll have to deal with her anyway, since you will be her children's stepmother (and besides, you are going to be the mother of their new sibling anyway).  Don't give her the pride of knowing that she has that effect on you.|`|e93d483d323b7ea0e774d586db75f7d8aa	I personally always felt that one divorce should be completly over before the new relationship comes to public eye, but if his lawyer supports you going then go.  Its the kids that really matter here and you are pregnant with his children's new sibling.  Might as well get intergrated now.|`|4EWCegiRaa	He needs custody of those kids and in order to do so, he needs you to go.<br>  <br>  You have no choice but to go.  Besides, you can avoid her forever.|`|AA11097612	You are paying the lawyer good money for his advice. You should take it.  That's what you're paying him/her for.|`|oojO4WAraa	The lawyer told you it would be in his best interest if you did go - so go.|`|LPEWAoWCaa	Yes you should go, just for moral support if not anything else.
bf6K6uubaa	i don't think you should dye those shoes...they are too price to ruin and they don't look like the typical ones you can dye|`|884v4VhGaa	I'd recommend against it. Some fabrics with a sheen or a nap don't take dye well. If the shoes aren't labelled as such then don't just take them to a cobbler. I've had a problem where the cobbler insisted that he could dye the shoes, and then when he ruined the fabric said that we should have expected that.|`|seU9VwIJaa	It will say dyeable right on the page. I wouldn't recommend dying that fabric.

All cloth or fabric shoes are NOT necessarily dyeable.  <br>  <br>  So, if there is the word dyeable written on the box, they are.<br>  If there is a fabric swatch included in the box that is the same color and fabric as the shoes, they are.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you would have to get with the company that makes them & see if they are or not.<br>  <br>  If you tell me what brand they are, I might already know if they make dyeable shoes or not.|`|fe9b029bc54c4ac54b1bb8bd85f6786faa	I think fabric shoes can be dyd to match - need to take them to a good shoe repair shop along with sample of dress fabric.

iPNOVR6Gaa	I've been married for 22 years.<br>  <br>  While I do expect to fully trust my wife, I do not expect her to feel the same for me for our whole life.  I expected and expect her to grow and change, to always strive toward becoming the person she wants to be while I do the same.  There will be mistakes and downfalls.  She put us through something really rough just over a year ago.  But I forgave her like she forgave a giant past screw-up of mine.<br>  <br>  I think it is better to marry not being financially dependent on anyone.  My wife was able to support herself without me before I came along, and vice versa.  That's still the case.  We are not together because we need to be together, but because we want to be together.<br>  <br>  How could I stand NOT seeing my wife every day?  When she takes the kids to her home state to visit their grandma for a week, I miss her!  Before she left to take our older daughter to school today, she kissed my cheek before she left.  I am looking forward to seeing her and kissing her when I get home this evening.<br>  <br>  Attraction changes.  She now has little more fat, a few more wrinkles, and a tad more grey than ever, but so what?  I look upon her with eyes of love.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, you know, and I still see many traits she has that even men who don't know her would admire.<br>  <br>  She is a mother, but then she was already the mother of a baby when I met her.  Now that baby is a young woman living on her own and working full time, a good person who I raised her whole life.  And we have two kids together.  One of the things I love the most about her is that she is the mother of my children, and a very good one at that.  I love having a life with my wife.  If I ever lost her, heaven forbid, I would be devastated.|`|IvMPh09baa	you are asking the same questions people do when they enter into marriage... nothing different from the beginning to the end.  its still the same risk, the same amount of effort and work and the same amount of respect and priority.<br>  <br>  You could be married 1 day or 50 years... no matter what, its still a relatinoship both people have to work at for the rest of their lives.<br>  <br>  i think alot of people see marriage as a piece of paper they just sign and then move on. wrong. its alot of work to keep up a relationship, its alot of communication and trust that is required to make a marriage last.  people don't understand what marriage fully entails from day 1, and if they dont' know what it is going to take then i would suggest waiting until you can learn.|`|afca6b46fa7fbd426fb9030a59f285aeaa	Yes, all of those bad things can happen. I think the most important thing is that people continue to grow. Marry someone who has some interests in common with you and someone who allows you to pursue your own interests without feeling threatened or jealous. Marry someone who you consider your best friend. Remember that if you feel like you're hitting a dull spot in your marriage, maybe it's time to just get out and do something for yourself. Take a short trip. When you start missing your spouse you'll remember why you married them in the first place.|`|NnN4drsbaa	two words.....Unconditional Love<br>  BTW as people get older, their likes and dislikes change. What used to be important, is now trivial. What matters most is family, friends, health, finances. Whose the hottest chick, whoes got a six pack, tightest ride, dopest rims, that crap don't matter when you get older|`|H3WHxCgaaa	We've been married 13 years this summer solstice (6/21/09) and as of last week known/dated for 20 years!  <br>  <br>  I trust my husband and I don't compare my marriage to others - it is a complete waste of time and energy.  <br>  <br>  I am financially independent but that's just a bonus!  I don't just contribute - I can hold my own if needed.  Empowering!  <br>  <br>  I see my husband every day and I swear the saying is right - men are like fine wine - they just get better with age!  I still find my husband to be very attractive and sexy...<br>  <br>  I don't believe I'm like a mother to my husband - ewww...that's like saying he's become like a father to me over time - ewww...Not really.<br>  <br>  I feel like we've gotten to know each other on a different level past year 10...you know each other on a deeper level...it's all good in my book.|`|pDrkcc6taa	If you have to ask than you do not know the definition of Love or the definition of commitment, than don't get married, please!<br>  <br>  Darling, that is what is WRONG with this country.  We are a throw away society, instead of working out things, or fixing them.  If you marry someone you are friends with, committed too and RESPECT, that your initial question is irrelevant.  Parents don't get warranties with their children, they love them for all their lives.  Come on, use common sense, and like I said perhaps you should not consider getting married with such a poor attitude.....
egpVC6uMaa	Lol...just because you are on a "diet" does not mean you cannot look at the menu. It is human nature to be attracted to others even when married and I have found myself attracted to other men...as long as I don't do anything about it.|`|mAZi1eH7aa	You are married, not dead or blind. Nothing changes at all, except that you have made a commitment to yourself and your partner and you should try to honour it.<br>  You will still be attracted to others as they will be to you. That is where the real test of yourself comes in.<br>  You can look all you want and enjoy the attention, but be faithful to your partner.|`|AA10408380	No. U might not be attracted to anyone else initially, because ur sig other rocks ur world, but after a bit, u'll see other attractive ppl. and feel attracted. It's natural for all, but one must be careful not to act on it. When it's cause to wonder if ur sig other isn't attracted to anyone else and it's been a while. Of course, if they're smart, they wont tell u, to spare ur feelings.|`|8PDzaAJcaa	I have seen men that are attractive but I wouldn't say I was attracted to them. It sounds weird, (I know)  but I think there is a difference. You can see the most "attractive" guy in the world and he can be a complete ***, would you be attracted to him or want to get with him? I wouldn't.|`|IvMPh09baa	honestly, yes.  i am still attracted to people, physcially speaking.  but i am in love... i dont' think its possible for me to be attracted beyond physicality to anyone else.  i can't even look at anyone else and think anything beyond them being physically attractive.|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	the longer you're married, the more others become attractive......<br>  because you stop getting what you got before you were married, know what i mean.......|`|H3WHxCgaaa	No - because I'm not dead.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	umm...maybe if i were dead.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Of course you can tell if someone besides your spouse is attractive, that's human nature, acting on it is when it becomes harmful. I do find other women attractive but I'm a lot more attracted to my wife than those women, she's more desirable to me than any other woman I've ever met (& I don't just mean physically). But I'd never act on it, that's just wrong.|`|EJYu4J1Aaa	It is completely natural to feel attracted to other people.  If only life were so easy though and we just automatically weren't attracted to other people once married...  Some people will say its not right, natural, etc.  but its just the way that we human beings work.   In other words, yes a lot of people are still attracted to other people once they're married and its ok!|`|kyqhMuSiaa	You can look just don't touch.

Why would I need valadation from soneone else?|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	I'm not dead. I'm not attracted to anyone else but I find other people attractive.

I think he'd understand, and he'd probably feel special to be your 1st kiss.<br>  <br>  I'd say it's normal to be a little nervous, but when it actually happens you'll be fine. And there's no hurry, I hadn't had my first kiss at your age either.|`|2a0c9bf25ddda2f2854a893478ac1cf4aa	It's not weird for you to be scared at all..

If you can tell it was an awkward kiss, and he reacts like it was, then just explain it away by telling him that you are nervous b/c you really like him a lot.<br>  <br>  If you continue pushing him away, he might take that as a sign that you aren't attracted to him and then break up w/ you.<br>  <br>  The longer you go and the older you get before you have your first kiss, the more embarrassing it is going to be for you to admit that to both others and yourself. Relax, have fun, and give him a kiss!|`|ZYICyUAGaa	You'll be okay. I smiled when I saw this because just a few years ago I was in the same position. 16 and never kissed anyone and had my first boyfriend.  I was so nervous, I avoided as much as I could because I thought that I would do something wrong or dumb. Finally, I confessed to my boyfriend and he smiled and admitted that it would be his first one too. We both took it slow and one day he just did it and I was relieved to find out how easy and natural it was. <br>  If you want to tell him, go ahead. If he's a good bf he'll understand and take it slow or at your pace. Don't be scared or nervous, you'll be just fine. Go with the flow and you will know when the time is right.|`|ftmmWpqbaa	Ahhh finally someone in the same situation as me :)<br>  If that's you in the picture, then you're super pretty!!<br>  I get told I'm really pretty too, and I've done some modelling before.<br>  I'm 16, but I'm shy!

I was in a 5 year live in relationship before this so I have some relationship experience I believe. I see it to often couples fighting and arguing about stupid things I could never get this. You need someone who obviously has no kids, and is an introvert. A quieter guy who can be patient. It sounds like you're both extroverts and that's why you're arguing all the time. I'm an introvert, I don't like to argue, my mans an extrovert and I see EASILY he and his X wife getting in blazing arguments because she was a loud extrovert too. There is a reason why they say opposites attract, it's like magnets or fitting a puzzle together, someone needs to lack an attribute where the mate can provide it. Yes I think you should get a divorce, if he's even mentioning it he's trying to give you an "out". This is not healthy, do not settle for anything you will find someone who fits your personality right. I do hope the best for you, and find someone who's generaly quiet and not a loud person. Remember, this is only the rest of your life decision, don't make yourself regret it, and if you think if you devorce you might get the urge to get back with him, though it may be hard, you need to cut off all contact with him, untile you find someone else to keep your mind off him. I'd go on Craigslist personals just to see whats out there, the personalitys. You don't want your husband, let him know what you're doing, and you're ready to move on with your life you're just not happy, he may be anry, but it'll also help him get over you quick too. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Oh, if he threatens suiside, that's very immature on his half, you need to report him to child services that this father is wanting to kill himself, for the sake of his poor children, someone that unstable should not be raising 3 kids, if you care about them.

Just tell him look I love u and ur kids but they are YOUR kids not mine and say that u will help and be supportive and do what u can BUT in the end they are his responsiblity not yours. Good luck!|`|sgkvXvNTaa	It doesn't seem like you are ready to be in this situation. If the answer to that is No, you are not ready to be in this situation then don't.|`|JnSXMZ7Yaa	In all reality if you have any doubts whatsoever that the relationship is not gonna work than the relationship is not gonna work.....|`|tLBjsrEFaa	get a divorce its obvious you are not compatible|`|571QpSNhaa	JUST TELL HIM **** WHAT YOU SCARED??|`|2ftssJmGaa	I think if you are not sure then you should think about leaving.

The short of my advice is you need to seriously evaluate your relationship with this man.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you want to be the responsible one by watching his children and not making him upset by talking about what bothers you, but you are being responsible for him and his life, not yours. That's not right. It is not your duty or your responsibility to take care of this guy or his children. Unfortunately for the children, he was irresponsible and has children he doesn't want to take care of. It's not up to you to be the mother. It's not a healthy way to be a mother. <br>  <br>  I think you need to leave him and cut all ties with him. You have a full life ahead of you and there are tons of men I am sure who would love to go out with you...and eventually one will prove to be a great husband and father. Life is about choices and coming from a woman who dated a guy with a lot of baggage.....you must make the choice to use good judgment in relationships and take care of you....a lot of guys always want to take take take and you need to be breave enough to say NO. Watch out for yourself and guard your heart.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid of leaving but it is when you don't have a suppprt system. Make the choice to leave and surround yourself with people who value you...your family...your friends...and develop a support system to help you through this rough patch. You will be soooo glad you did it! Be strong! :)|`|AZosrzoPaa	Don't worry!!! Just look after the Kids! I am 14 and I think teenagers are quite easy 2 look after.

You are selfish and immature.  Just divorce the poor guy so he can move on with his life and find someone that is actually going to be his partner in life; someone who he can depend on.  You obviously are not there for him so just leave!<br>  <br>  Seriously...a letter!?!  Have a backbone and face up to your mistakes!  Sit him down and tell him face to face.|`|SVqjzEE3aa	sit him down with the tv off and no distractions...and tell him to give you time to think about what you have to say...and just tell him...thats what I do with my hubby...we've been married for 6 months on the 28 feb...and he is deploying to iraq may1st....so its hard for me to tell him my feelings because he wants me to be as strong as a soldier...but you hang in there...|`|UM9LlPWDaa	Truthfulness is the only thing I have found that works. Whether or not that means you stay together, start over or lose contact is a different story. <br>  <br>  Just sitting him down and saying it will start the process. It is never the truth people are afraid of but the outcome of that.|`|f4RnGIeSaa	I think it is best to just sit down and discuss it.  You are the one at fault for agreeing to marry him when you weren't ready.  You knew he had children when you said "I do" and so you put yourself in that position.<br>  <br>  I think from what you said you are too immature and selfish right now to be married to anyone.

So, when wives know hubby is in their back pocket its easy to follow through with temptation.|`|NE1cgh3Vaa	It's all the same to me.

I would be fine every other day but generally have it once a week, and that's way up from say 3 years ago.<br>  <br>  The truth is that some people know what they are doing, while others don't have the first clue.

lVIdENvqaa	Tell him if he doesn't leave you alone you will tell the family and your hubby.<br>  Sex happens sometimes between two young people without giving it much thought just because you two were together so much. It shouldn't have happened, but it did and I know you regret it now.<br>  so, set him straight and if he doesn't stop, then follow through with the information to the family.|`|T7fEjogWaa	Ummm, I think you should ignore him.  He will get the hint that you are no longer interested and are happily married.  Dont say anything to him or your husband, it will only cause unwanted drama.  If you truely dont want his attention or to hurt his and your own family, i would not acknowledge any flirtatious activity.|`|lxouDjtqaa	"Should i talk to him and risk total humiliation"<br>  <br>  You don't need to risk humiliation, you can ask him to stop a specific behavior that he is doing and he would have a hard time denying. Is he staring at you? Ask him to stop. Touching you? Tell him you don't want him to do that. Make it very clear that you are not interested. You have probably already done that, but make sure. Even if you were both single, you'd have every right to tell him stop these things. It does not matter that you have history, he is harassing you if you ask him to stop and he doesn't.<br>  <br>  It's up to you how many warnings you give him and what action you take if he doesn't stop. Options range from ignoring it, to avoiding him to involving the rest of the family, to getting a restraining order. If your sisters notice it, ask one of them to talk to him.<br>  <br>  If you "tell on him" to your husband, do you think that would end well, or just cause a fight, or worse? Can you speak to his parent, your stepfather or stepmother?|`|4EWCegiRaa	Go to the source of the issue and all the other potential issues will go away:  Tell your step-bother to stop and stop now!<br>  <br>  Ignoring the problem is probably the worst thing you can do because it's going to builld and build and build until it explodes and you lose everything.|`|HhCL30uUaa	First of all stop blaming his actions in the present for something that happened when you were teenagers (early twenties, whatever).  You have recognized as the reckless behavior of two young people.  Why can't he do the same and stop with the flirting?  He doesn't sound like a very good guy to me in the first place.  I think you should just talk to him, even if its over the phone so you don't have to face him, and tell him that happened a long time ago and you want nothing more to do with that kind behavior with him.  You might have to go to the place where you actually threaten to tell the family, but he will fall for that because guys are totally shallow and everything scares them away.  I wouldn't involve your husband just yet, but if it continues after the talk you may have to consider involving him, you might want to mention that to Mr. Wonderful as well.  Good luck!
3y0w1qIBaa	Sure, why not?  After all, best friends build up a great and strong bond with each other and the relationship could last out long.  If you like this guy, then go for it.  Be aware that if one of you break up, it takes time to go back to friends.|`|u4cWbuPvaa	You either have to be happy with the friendship unless you really like them! then you take a Risk and things could work out perfectly|`|ix5Wmhy0aa	I think it's really inportant to be friends with your BF first, but you sound so close now. If you two did go out and it ended badly, you may never be able to get back what you had before, which woud be such a shame. Even if you are still friends afterwards it will never be like what you have at the moment.<br>  <br>  On the other hand you two may be really happy and stay together for ages, but why take the risk?<br>  <br>  Unless you are really sure that you two can make it work, maybe it would be better to look for a boyfriend that you aren't so close to.<br>  <br>  I hope that whatever you chose works out for you.

iIU4u0AIaa	That is very messed up, but what could you do, things happen. My advice to you is to talk to your boss and be honest about the way you feel. Telling him how you feel shouldn't kill him. In fact if they have moved you to a lower position and you still get paid the same thing then why is it that your mad. If you still get the same amount of money then just try to think positive, less work more money, hopefully. Think positive to improve you spirit and watch how everything will come into place. If you have been put to a lower position then try to figure out why is it, yes we have concluded that one reason is because of his daughters close friend but ask yourself, Is there any other reason? Are you a good, hard-working person then talk to him. Tell him why did i have to get a lower pay (if you did) if i am very hard-working, loyal and blah blah blah...Try to find a solution. If he payed you less then tell him that you love working there and want to stay there but taking away someones money from there paycheck unless they have not done there job right its disagreeable. If a solution is not concluded then all i can say it to find something better because you deserve it. Have friends around you to bring positive things into your head and to motivate you to fight for whats right for you. Let them help you find you a job or family. Just keep positive because you will find another job only if that will end up to be your only solution. Maybe your next job will pay you more for your experience and will know how to care for there employees. GOODLUCK|`|4EWCegiRaa	Well.. there's a few ways to go about this.<br>  <br>  1.  Know you're overqualified and look for a job that suits you better.  There's nothing wrong with leaving for a better job and one that suits you better.<br>  2.  Look at it as helping a friend.  She's probably not as good as you are and you need to help her until she is.  You're helping the company<br>  3.  Lower job = lower expectations.  Sure it's nice to advance your career but that doesn't mean you can't have more fun given the situation since the job responsibility is less.  I'm not saying slack off but it's got to be less stress, right?<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd go with #1|`|HhCL30uUaa	Just remember...actions speak louder than words.  Show that you're overqualified for the job, outdo every task given to you.  It will help take up your time so you'll have less time being bitter and the end result will be in your favor.  When others start noticing that maybe you are in the wrong job and start talking then the bosses will get the hint that a mistake has been made, maybe even your bosses' boss, even better.  In the meantime, try to remember that being bitter only hurts you, it makes you ugly inside and that ultimately will reveal itself on the outside for everyone to see.  You seem like a really nice person for any worrying about this at all.  I would probably do something extremely vindictive like wait until a deadline or something is coming near and I would quit!  Which would only hurt me, right?  Good luck.

However, I do know people who brag about cheating so I know that some people can feel pride from something like that. <br>  <br>  I've answered questions about cheating and have given honest answers in response. Although I'm regretful of my actions, I don't present my answers in an apologetic way because for one thing, I didn't marry anyone here and the other thing, I owe no one an apology. So, I think the answers are more truthful than the question sometimes and the questions are coming from people who just want to be a dick.

All i can explain to you is how it feels so that you can understand, sometimes your brain just feels a little numb, out of it, i get tired and snappy easily, and all you want is to be comfortable really. So just take it into consideration when with her and try not to make it a big deal but at the same time, notice she's on and support her, at least until she gets into a routine. You say you are close, so let her know you can talk about it together if she ever needs to.<br>  <br>  Chocolate is always good for these times :) ha ha, no just suggest doing relaxing things when hanging out - like watching a movie or video games or just something where you wont have to move around much, as periods can be very painful - especially when just starting out. <br>  <br>  I know it can be embarrassing for guys but if you really care and don't want to be awkward around her then i hope this helps. Below is a website all about periods if you want to wise up on some of the aspects of them at all, don't be embarrassed in doing this, believe me girls will appreciate it! :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.likeitis.org/periods.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.likeitis.org/periods.html</a>|`|6sTsDvKmaa	Look, don't do anything except be her friend.  If she feels comfortable enough to talk to you about it, she will.  But definitely don't bring it up.  This is something new and strange for her, and she may want to go through it alone, or with a woman's support.  Eventually she will get used to it and things will return to normal between you two.|`|wlWCGGVIaa	i know how she feels and i really get moody with some of my friends when its that time of the month too but the best thing you can do is be there for her, give her space and when she seems to be getting annoyed just back off because sometimes it can be tiny things that you don't know you're doing. Aren't us girls fun lol <br>  Hope it all goes well x|`|T588vfJDaa	Aww you're sweet. It's not that big a deal, it's not like we're grieving or anything serious, just a few nutty hormones. My friends are all guys and I just tell them not to be repetitive around me and not to take offence at anything I say on those days|`|k2bNhHhsaa	awww thats so kind of you to think of her but its nothing really serious i mean its a bigg part in a girls life but if you dont want her to know then just act how you normally act around herr<br>  hope i helpedd<br>  ?xo?Jenna?xo?|`|mbHMdzbyaa	well mood swings are very common when girls get their period. if she's acting weird around you, then you know when she gets it. just try to be supportive of what she does and then she wont have any reason to lash back at you.|`|nFGgWOuZaa	well this is coming from a  girl , if you haven't said anything to upset her then just cary on as normal i hate it when people treat me differently because of it <br>  <br>                           hope  i  helped <br>                                 charley<br>                                      x|`|PpskoR9Yaa	I can tell by what you said that you really care about your friend. I am a girl and i know what she goes through. Wen its my timea the month i just need to be left alone for a little. Dont argue with her or piss her off just let her be; but dont ignore her. As long as you remain understanding and treat her extra nice wen you know its comming you;ll be fine. <br>  <br>  ohh and ps. if she is the extra bitchy type like if she starts yelling at you for no reason, ignore it becouse its just all hormones|`|bVQO0BsPaa	It can be tough for girls when they're initially getting used to having their periods. Mood wings are inevitable unfortunately, and the men get it the worst. I'm not afraid to admit it either.<br>  Try and let her know you're there for her. Don't probe her with questions about it, we don't want that at all. Just let her know that, and then give her some space. To be honest, it's the best you can do.<br>  Just be glad it's only one week a month huh?

wlGVy803aa	Boy, does your situation bring back many happy memories!  I only had one child because I'm just no good at multi-tasking!  <br>  <br>  For me, I loved to read so I read a lot to my son.  Today, he reads and loves anything having to do with history.  Also, bought some white, glossy paper and he and I would finger paint or color in a coloring book or cut and paste things that he drew.  He was about 20 months old at the time.<br>  <br>  I'd let him watch his cartoons and Sesame Street, too.  One last thing....buying educational toys can capture a child's imagination...even a 6 mo old's and keep them entertained for a while.  One last thing:  I would make up stories about "Johnny" that always had a moral to it and he loved it.<br>  <br>  I know that all the above is no entertainment for you per se but they grow so quickly and before you know it, they'll be gone.  Like you said, spring and summer are coming and you'll be able to get yourself and kiddos out of the cabin fever you're so strongly feeling right now.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|09DE4NG3aa	For the older one, playdough!  Make your own with 2 cups of flour, 1 cup salt, 1 cup water, 2 T oil and 1 tsp of food colouring.  Mix the wet ingredients together in one bowl, then add the dry ingredients.  If it is too wet to handle easily, then add more flour.  If you keep it in a covered container, it will last a couple of days.  He can poke his fingers into it, roll it into long snakes, you can cut around a plate to make a circle so he can make a face in it....<br>  <br>  Also, an oven tray full of rolled oats makes a great building site for him to run his toy cars through, and bury them if he wants.  <br>  <br>  He is probably old enough to want to do an obstacle course, e.g. crawl under a chair, step over the baby's toy, roll along a towel, then run back.  My daughters can do this for hours on end.  <br>  <br>  Take all the cushions off the couch and let him make a path of them along the floor, or stack them up to make a tower and jump on them.<br>  <br>  Put a little blue food colouring and a small squirt of dishwashing liquid in the bath for him to get into and pretend to be a shark or Nemo.  My daughters are mermaids, but I'm guessing he isn't into that.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Ha ha ha.  If you get through this, you can get through anything.  Stick it out, it's worth it.<br>  <br>  I read, I watched telly (but not really much.)  <br>  <br>  Mornings:  feed everyone, clean house.  Kids entertain themselves ( expect them to do this or they'll suck you dry for the rest of your life.)<br>  Lunch.<br>  After lunch: nap for EVERYONE mummy included.<br>  After that:  afternoon tea and playtime.  With or without the kids.  Don't play with teh kids too much:  it gives them ideas - but making a batch of playdough and playing with them is nice in the afternoons, or telling them a story when they're older.<br>  then the dinner grind, etc....<br>  <br>  Get them to bed by 7:30.  Baby keeping you up till 11:00 no good: feed a decent feed at night: you using farex and foods yet, or are you going with the (only 5-yr-old) utter belief in no solids till ... whenever they're doing it till now...?  Stoke that kid up at the 7:oo ish feed:  fill him to the gunwales.  Your evenings are yours:  grab them, demand them, do not permit anyone to fiddle with them.  They are the only time you see hubby.<br>  <br>  Right: now, what to do for Mum.  I wrote two mills & boones.  I painted.  I read books.  I learned everything I wanted to learn. This is what my mummy said to me:<br>  <br>  opportunities come at you in their own way, and the trick in life is to see what space you're in as having opportunities no other space could give.  One day you'll be working: and what will you wish you could do then?  You'll wish you had time to grow your garden, or whatever.  <br>  <br>  imagine you don't have what you have and you'll work out what you 'would have liked to have done when you had the chance'. Most humans work on an 'if only' mechanism: they fail to see the freedoms they have at the time, only see what they have lost.  So walk forward a few years in your head, look back, and wish you had....<br>  then walk back in time and go do it.<br>  <br>  There you go.  Clear as mud?|`|J5zj8dWRaa	Is there a nearby park you can walk to?  Or just take a walk around the neighborhood.

A lot of the choice is really about what you are comfortable with. Consider bringing some role play in, the "sheriff and the barmaid" or "harem girl and sheik" work well. Or get some dirty dice and play a game that way (available at spencer gifts or online for about $7). Or you could go with some nice lotions and a vibrator. Consider too, a little "slap and tickle" as it were. You can get cute little kits with faux handcuffs and blindfolds in them.<br>  <br>  Again, what do YOU find interesting? Build on it. What are YOU comfortable with? Stay in your comfort zone while experimenting, that way you will both have fun!|`|9hhxojfZaa	Well, if he is only your boyfriend and he already seems bored in the bedroom, than maybe it is time to find a new boyfriend!  Usually it takes years of marriage to maybe get a little monotonous, but if you are just dating, that is a sad state of affairs.  <br>  <br>  Is there something you think he might want to do, that you have never let him, or said you didn't want to?  If you let him do it, than maybe it would turn him on more, just the fact that you are doing it.  Watch some porn and try to emulate what the women do in the films, stuff you haven't done before.<br>  <br>  But remember, once you do those things he might expect them ever time, as part of your regular bedroom time.  You can't do them every time, you'll just have to switch it up constantly to keep it spicy.<br>  <br>  But in my opinion, if he's already bored, i would get rid of him.|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	Spice things up covers a lot of areas, some of which would get people kicked off Answers.|`|79wOWoM0aa	Invite me and my wife over.|`|faOBk7qtaa	im sorry
ml2FDYECaa	Considering that he is your brother, he will always be there. May as well be the best bigger brother you can be. I will assume you are older than him. He may be upset as he looks up to you, and you didn't come through for him. My suggestion to you is that you help him find a job, but he has to take you out for a beer on his first paycheck...make a deal kinda thing. By doing that he will not only get a job, he'll be rewarded by hanging out with you...can't beat that. Not selfish, but maybe a little immature, or insecure...be the hero, and guide him in the right direction. It might not be what you want to do, but it is a good thing...GL|`|WYaaPmd8aa	What does your parent's say?  Evidently nothing since they are letting him spunge off of them.  First, I would tell your parents (just in case they've missed it) what he's doing about you and the job and tv and you live in the house too and don't appreciate it, that you're trying to better yourself and need to study and need some consideration in the household and for once, they as parents, need to step up to the plate and kick him to the curb and do something about him.  That being said, you have let them know your feelings.  Then tell your brother to go screw himself and find his own job and be thankful he's not talking to you.  I am assuming, you're in college.  Can you  move out? Live in a dorm or with a friend and share expenses?  Do you work?  If not, you need to get a job and start saving for your own place, get out and get your own life and leave them behind. Good luck.|`|W0633l18aa	convince your parents that they need to kick him out to gain independance or make him start paying rent so he has to get a job and that if they let him live like this he is only going to ruin his life and it is what is best for him<br>  <br>  give him an ultimatum and tell him what a mess he is. <br>  <br>  Move or steal the tv <br>  <br>  Gode him into gettign a job, get a job yourself and constantly rub it in his face till the point he gets off his backside and starts looking for one<br>  <br>  gd luck|`|RDz4LmHDaa	hes pethetic and wont have nothing!<br>  <br>  look i understand thats your brother but he is 30!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  be serious!!D:<<br>  <br>  leave him so he can be nothing in his life|`|DIBzlY6Faa	stand up for yourself say (his name) please turn the tv down and if he says no say you never apreciate me or anything i do i have helped you find a job and alls your doing is treatin me  like dirt!|`|AA10738539	I think his not talking to you solves half of the problem.

What you gotta do is to find out what is really the matter with him. Since he cried when you wanted to break up with him maybe it means that he really loves you so give him a chance.

VZVGXRyraa	It seriously sounds like she thinks she's pregnant. She can take a test 2 weeks after the time you have sex but since you two seem to go at it non stop, wait to see if she gets her period, if she doesn't she can take a test then.<br>  <br>  If you don't want her to get an abortion, just refuse to take her to the clinic. You're right, you can't keep her from going but you certainly don't have to make it easy for her. I know if i got my fiancee pregnant and she wanted to get an abortion i wouldn't be the one taking her.|`|mJ8T1soxaa	She could be, or she could just be trying to get you to wear condoms because shes paranoid about it.

Seeing how you would respond if she was to get pregnant.  Just because she's on birth control, doesn't mean you shouldn't use condoms.  She can stop the pill without telling you.  She can miss ONE pill and get pregnant.  The pull out method doesn't prevent pregnancy.  You "leak" semen during intercourse.  All it takes is ONE sperm to get her pregnant.  You need to use condoms!  I'm not saying this girl would trap you, but there are some girls out there who would purposely get pregnant.  You have to protect yourself!  Until she misses a period, nothing to worry about.  Then if she does miss a period, make sure you are there when she takes the test, and make sure she goes to the doctor.  There is no way she would know she is pregnant without taking a test, especially this soon.|`|IUnC3dbraa	if she's on birth control and taking it correctly (taking them everyday at the same time) then there is a 99% chance that she is NOT pregnant. she also would not "feel like there is a baby inside her" because it would be microscopic right now...it sounds like maybe she is just paranoid. <br>  <br>  she COULD be lying about being on birth control...because if she was she would not be worried unless she didn't know the actual statistics. <br>  <br>  OR she could just be testing you to see what kind of man you are...if she was to ever get pregnant do you care enough to stick around or take care of her/take her to get an abortion. <br>  <br>  the only way to really fix this problem is to 1. tell her to take a pregnancy test if she misses her period, 2. have a talk with her about if she really is on birth control and if she is, why is she so paranoid. also ask her if she is taking it every day and not missing any pills. <br>  <br>  hope this helps! and good luck|`|SvMKiVMkaa	When she said if im pregnant will you go with me since you're over 18 she said it in a sarcastic way. i think its a sign for you to start using condoms and bein more careful. if she was pregnant she would feel nauseous you cant feel the baby in few days you have to way untill it develops|`|YkzPfyp2aa	Hopefully after all this paranoia, you'll start using condoms.<br>  The only way to tell if she is pregnant is if she gets a test and if she is she wouldn't feel the baby this soon unless she is months further along.<br>  Cramps in girls are normal.|`|dVfanJkcaa	the same thing happened to me and it very well could be that she is pregnant once again birth control does not protect 100% only 99.9% that 0.1% could make a difference, i say ask her to take a test after like a week or so and find out|`|hl0iK2nsaa	okay so first of all calm down. <br>  i know how this feels. <br>  me and  my guy have been together for a while now too.<br>  i know how judge - mental people can be just because they think you are to young.<br>  but the cramps are more than likely signs of her period if she is close.<br>  cramps aren't exactly a sign of pregnancy. <br>  throwing up and getting sick and not feeling well are.<br>  but really i think you guys are okay.<br>  just start cleaning up afterwards.|`|oVOaaEJnaa	If she took her pill properly then there is only a 3% chance she is pregnant but yes i spose she could be. Not a lot of people get any signs as early as she says she is unless she is late. She can't be that late though cos you haven't been with her long. Her mum being pregnant has probably just got the idea stuck in both your heads and now your freaking out.|`|w7g4eGqFaa	well, that is a hard position to be in.<br>  if shes pregnant, i would prefer to keep it and just set it up for adoption after. dont kill the baby. and if shes not then just use protection as much as possible.  being a lil too proctected wont hurt(:|`|KdvVvCmnaa	To answer the question; "are these signs? [of pregnancy]"<br>  <br>  Really, there are MANY symptoms a woman can experience while being pregnant. You're best bet is to not go off of "symptoms" cuz many of the signs your girlfriend has explained can be caused by other things. <br>  <br>  Since she's on birth control and assuming she's taking them correctly taking an at home pregnancy kit may show a false positive because of the hormones they contain. <br>  <br>  My advice is to go to a free clinic and have her tested there. Talk to a doctor about her symptoms and they will be able to explain everything in detail. <br>  <br>  ...I know you didn't ask but just for future reference, if she's not taking her birth control correctly and you're relying on the pull-out method, you can STILL get her pregnant. It's not a safe way to prevent pregnancy at all. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|cGuu5ESuaa	Maybe its just a really bad time of month, and girls just want to know this stuff for security. If their guy wouldn't take them to an abortionist if they got pregnant they would maybe feel less inclined to have sex. Just because they may feel the guy doesn't care, she wants to know you are there for her and make sure you are. If she is pregnant you need to be there for her. Ask her if she wants to take a pregnancy test and if she does then thats her decision, some take just 5 minutes so thats how long you may be panicking, talk to her, its the best way to figure this whole thing out.|`|lIpjuMTHaa	She needs to get a test but she wouldnt be able to feel the movement of a baby until about 16-18 weeks. So she wouldnt be pregnant from you if she was.|`|G4Y96LGqaa	first off, quit shooting off in her. Secondly, tell her that killing a baby is not in your immediate plans for solving a problem. I have a couple of friends who have had abortions, they now regret it. One buddy's wife who had the abortion can no longer get pregnant, they missed their opportunity to have a baby forever. The problem is half yours, you need to step up and voice your stance!|`|dQCZDAqgaa	just have her take the test and you can stop all this worrying.|`|2daebb3597a4356f1b883fea4d41414eaa	There is no possible way she could feel a baby if she were less than 6-7 months pregnant.  If she is on the pill, then chances are she is not pregnant, if she is and felt it, its not yours.|`|PLtU5AuYaa	WEAR A CONDOM FOR CHRIST SAKE!<br>  <br>  What do you think those where invented for? Water balloons???<br>  <br>  If she is knocked up you two only have yourselves to blame, birth control is NOT 100% protective. And to your last part, it is not just her decision, it is yours as well. After all half of that kid is you. Take a test and see, but if you two where to protect yourselves the right way the first time around you would not be here.<br>  <br>  PS- A baby does not develop in ones stomach.|`|ojiO3svoaa	YOUR STUPID DECISIONS PUT YOU IN THIS PREDICAMENT. WHERE A CONDOM AND TELL YOUR FAST *** GIRLFRIEND TO GET ON SOME BIRTH CONTROL! UH, YEAH SHE MIGHT BE PREGNANT BUT IT ALSO SOUNDS LIKE SHE IS LOOKING FOR ATTENTION. ONE DAY YOU WILL LOOK BACK ON THIS AND REALIZE HOW RETARDED YOU ARE BEING. OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE NOT MATURE ENOUGH TO BE HAVING SEX. AND YES ....THIS COULD RUIN YOUR LIVES.  GROW UP NOW AND DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN NEXT MONTH....IF YOU GET LUCKY AND SHE IS NOT PREGGERS NOW.|`|NAqfPvmHaa	she felt a baby kicking?not possible when if she was pregnant she would only be a few weeks gone!|`|80b2d9dd1b346a0b0eaa4df0197bee14aa	She could be just having sympathy symptoms. If she is caring for her mom, then she is listening to all the things that her mom is going through. She could also just be bloated. I am a mother of a 7 yr old and when I first got pregnant, I did not feel anything. You really cant feel anything until you are much further along. BELIEVE ME! The best thing that you could do is insist that she takes a test to ease everyone minds or just go to a Planned Parenthood. Go with her so that you can make sure what she is telling you is the truth. Havent you ever seen Boyz n the Hood. The dad said never trust a girl that says she is on the pill. Not only is this her life that is on the line, but yours as well. Pregnancy is not the only thing that you need to be concerned with.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and I hope everything works out for you!|`|Kvajun9yaa	well i really hope if she is pregnant that she does not get an abortion...um i can not really say if she is pregnant i am not sure at al!! bur maybe you should get her tested right away because if she is you two should figure out what you are going to do! good luck and i hope everything works out!|`|LcOPL8gCaa	Your girl friend is out to lunch. She is just around her mom and thinking about it alot i kinda think she wants to be pregnant.<br>  <br>  Take her to the doctors and If she was pregnant don't let her get an abortion. It doesn't matter what she wants, and some people are just dumb. Tell her you want the baby to live and if she doesn't wanna step up to the plate to care for it you will with or with out her.<br>  Your old enough to have sex, then your old enough to be a father.<br>  ITs the harsh truth, but don't make a mistake. Next time clean up.<br>  <br>  Anyways get a test.<br>  <br>  Good luck & best wishes|`|Q9sjbSkqaa	first of all an abortion is wrong in anyway no doubt she may or may not be pregnant and a baby will not mess up ur life.... but to tell u about the pulling out that never works because theres this thing call percum during intercourse u r cumming through out the whole time she can still get pregnant even if u pull out that the way it is...... if she is pregnant dont leave her be a man and stay no matter wat she chooses to do i wish u the best in ur guyses relationship and i hope she isnt pregnant.... but its sort of seems like she may be... idc if i get best answer but i thought i would inform u of the pulling out not working again i wsih u the best and the best sex is abstinence|`|RKC36n9Naa	i think she is paranoid about getting pregnant b/c it would mess things up...like you said, i'm sure she is worried about her mom finding out, losing her way of life right now, and maybe even messing up your relationship b/c you are so young. i don't think she is pregnant (you don't get pains during early pregnancy, that usually is a bad sign...like a miscarriage if anything) i think she is just getting her period...sometimes there is pain and sometimes there isn't, her body may be changing b/c she is still young. i can understand the sort of paranoia that she may be feeling. i use to be that way with my bf at her age, but then when we got older it didn't matter anymore if i did get pregnant, so i stopped worrying that it MIGHT happen. good luck!|`|ee4678869d4897b2132614f58b4c0ecfaa	For starters, just because she's on birth control, that doesn't mean you can have sex with no condoms.  You can still catch diseases.  Even if you were having sex for 3 weeks, there is no way on this green Earth that she could feel a baby kick.  Also, if you're 18 or older and she's only 16, her being pregnant might be the least of your worries once her parents find out.<br>  <br>  I think that she's just worried.  Tell her to go ahead and get a pregnancy test so that she and you both can stop worrying.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and I don't think that you can take her to get an abortion since she's only 16.  I'm pretty sure her parents would have to take her.  It does depend on what state you live in.|`|qVMg9YRsaa	She's just freaking out... cramps don't really mean you're pregnant... if she doesn't have a period, then you worry... until then she needs to just go to the doctor... it sounds like she could have a unrinary tract infection or something like that!!! Doesn't sound like a baby
SjEH1Lx6aa	You have the right to be angry because she promised you she would be there today and blew your little girl off like it was nothing. It's her birthday for crying out loud. Also, the other grandparents didn't even bother to remember.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would be a furious mama wolf and let them know.|`|RA8ZZP5Baa	Alright you have every right to be mad, I would be pretty pissed. It seems that they don't really care about your kids when they should!<br>  <br>  As for the Birthday party at Mcdonalds that's something I would never do. Not putting you down or anything its just,  who the hell wants to have there bday at a fast food place?<br>  <br>  Guess it's okay for toddlers, i would have gone to a park and invited his/her friends.|`|3ff7fbbf6ec3ee979b59d7290a91816daa	You are the better grandparent.  Your grandchildren will grow up and realize who actually is more deserving of their love, so they will chose to be with you more often than the other set of grandparents.  Just continue demonstrating to your grandchildren the love and respect they totally deserve but don't worry or stress about the others since it sounds like they are selfish and disrespectful to begin with.  Your grandchildren will see it for themselves.|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	I wouldn't stop your kids from seeing their grandparents, but I would stop playing damage control on their behalf.<br>  <br>  If you granddaughter asks you why none of her grandparents came to her party, tell her you don't know but that if she wants to ask, she can call them.  Let them deal with the disappointed babies.  Why should you have to do it?|`|ajOlzSJ1aa	I can't imagine that happening to my kids!<br>  Next time don't tell the child that her grandparents are invited, if they show up that is there decision, They are the ones to be missing out,if they don't,I mean 5 years old? little sweetie..!|`|n84CnN9eaa	sounds like its both, their grandparents are being a*s holes, and you are over reacting, but if it was up to me, if they asked me for something, id be like, i dont feel like it.|`|qEwOcoycaa	Yes this would make me so mad they are saying that they don't care. But they are the ones who always want you to remember there birthday and want gifts as well those things pisses me off.|`|ts0ovlOOaa	i only read half of it but thats real F*cked up and i would keep them away from my child if they are going to treat her like that. there plenty of good people out there.|`|BqaSKOtraa	I don't have children or even married yet...but if my grandparents ever did that to me (considering they don't have alsiehmers) I would totally get mad!!|`|IRbveMBaaa	yes it will make me mad and really piss off|`|FDgarm4Zaa	id be mad. its the grandparents, they have to be there!|`|2aI0UmhWaa	i be dissapointed too.    **** them hateerz...  i got family that be ****** up forget tose             yanks|`|NJ9qPuDqaa	Hell yeah id be pissed too|`|RRL138Tlaa	Hell yeah i be mad *** hell.<br>  The next time u r having something for ur kids don't tell the grandparents about it.Since they never show up what's the point inviting them.<br>  I bet if u don't tell them they will call and ask what u r doing for ur kids b-day.Then when u tell them they will say y u didn't call and let me know.That's when u explain to them that u and ur husband r tried of them disappointing ur kid and that u decided not to put ur kids through the pain and disappointments again.Tell them that if they wish to come they r welcome but don't be the one to inform them of any events.They know when ur kids b-day r. <br>  Don't keep the kids away from them. When the time is right they will start to ask there grandparents y.When it comes from ur kids then they will have to answer for them self. By u saying something to them isn't making a different but when ur kids ask then they will feel bad and start to change|`|krThCHxyaa	Well, I would be mad but I wouldn't say its bad grand parenting pursay.I think they are just lazy;but this dosen't mean you shouldn't allow your children not to see them, because this would hurt your children as well. They love their grandparents I'm sure. You know what you should do though? You should play the guilt trick on them. Just try and make the granparents feel guilty for breaking their promises ^^<br>  My mother does it all the time after my Grandparents do that to me.|`|u6Fhrs8naa	Uh, yeah. I would be mad out of my wits! I don't think you should keep going back and thinking about those times. Just forget about it and completely ignore it. My grandparents (from my father's side) have been doing that since I was a kid, and, now I've just turned into a teen and have learned to ignore it. Try not to take things too seriously. Just ignore it and take care of your kids, since they are the ones that come first.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.. :-) And, take care...|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	Perhaps you should just forget the Grands''. If your kids ask to see them call and see if they are willing. If not, just continue living your life. I can relate in that my kids were put in the same boat once. They were told to come visit a grandparent, around Christmas time, because she had a present for them. When we got there, they were told it was still in lay-away. My son (25 now) to this day does NOT visit them.|`|YSVSeRJUaa	Yes, that's a little crazy. I would be offended at first but you need to move on with it and realize that you are a great parent to your child. If every child on this earth had one great parent, we would all be just fine. I grew up without much attention from the grandparents and I don't resent them or anything. I'm just happy to have great parents!|`|Y9nJxRlpaa	FIRST OF ALL. TELL YOUR CHILD I SAID HAPPY B DAY.sECOND OF ALL, I actually think that what you arre going through is all that involves of being a good parent just watching over your child. your parents should be a shame d of the way they are treating their grand baby|`|r3PgrJhDaa	yes, I would be mad too!<br>  just focus on being a good mother (sounds like you are if you care this much and it bothers you)<br>  and forget about them.|`|9vccbqrVaa	Well, can you blame them?  Who would want to spend the day with a 5 year old?  I mean, how much fun would that really be?|`|yj7fKi2Kaa	i would be extremely upset if this situation occurred.<br>  it is immature and irresponsible.|`|GtNUIvQtaa	i feel you on this one. that would piss me off to no end. i'd definitely confront them on this one.|`|OdFIQYyhaa	that would make me vary pissed off yo!|`|To6cfSwFaa	Pisssssed I would be|`|sERi28Z1aa	Yes|`|AA10464614	yes|`|caTPi1e0aa	yea damn right id be mad but just remember don't get too frustrated and chill out. if you feel that its the right thing to stop your daughter from seeing the bad grandparents then i thinks it the best because as you said you have helped them whenever they needed it but they can't even show up for their grandchild's birthday and saying they forgot is just unacceptable|`|dcbf3f0dfa7ae0ae446bea315e760b58aa	You are training your children for their future----you are 90% of their role model, so remember that in all situations. The spotlight is on YOU , not any other relative. Relatives (and quality time spent with them) are a nice "extra", but you are your children's backbone.<br>  <br>  Your kids will do and feel what you have trained them to do and feel.<br>  They will handle crises (selfish relatives) as they see you handle them.<br>  Be so completely strong emotionally that nothing OTHER PEOPLE do can upset you---be a role model to "model" strength of character for your children.<br>  If you freak out when people "disrespect" you, it will make your children super-sensitive to any person they come across, and frightened of rejection---guess what, the real world is ALL rejection.<br>  <br>  Kids need to see and interact with their relatives----even if they are horrible---because they need to see the reality of WHO they are.<br>  They have inherited looks, health, talents, and character from all these people---the better they know them (not necessarily being cuddled and loved by them, but just to hang out with them) the better they will know themselves-----50 years from now, they will need this knowledge, and it has nothing to do with you.<br>  <br>  Kill your relatives with KINDNESS----they are a fact of life that everyone especially your children, will have to understand and live around like the weather.|`|igztwLPBaa	I do not believe that  you are over reacting..n fact i would be boiling mad if i were you. I think if u refuse, or make up reason for the grandparents no to see your kids for a while...that would teach them a lesson.. Just have to find a way to keep your kid's minds off their grandparents..(if u can)...Good Luck..n i believe that the only person that should matter to 5 yr old child is their parent's love..so as long as u giving them that aatention..then everything hould be A-Ok|`|vhOQ68M5aa	Definitely, do they really have anything better to do?|`|D4XWrwuaaa	They suck as grandparents.  Not sure I would not let the kids see them though because that might get turned on you and make you look like the "bad guy."<br>  <br>  I would just give the kids the option for visiting with grandparents. If the grandparents want to visit and the kids want them to then go with it. But if the kids don't want to see them, then honor the kids wishes and tell the grandparents to take a flying leap!|`|i7axq25Maa	You should just not tell your kids whats exactly going on, sionce theyre young, just tell them your parents are busy or something along the lines of that.<br>  Later, once they are older you can explain to them. My mom is like your mom. Theres really no changing that. Sorry.|`|FmhUZLgoaa	Yup I would be very mad. Next time they make a promise don't tell your kids about it just in case they back out your kids didn't even know that it was supposed to happen.|`|glynFK9haa	That's not nice.  Grandparents should always be happy to see their kids and grandkids.|`|GoWPQvgHaa	This would make me very mad.|`|YrDkC937aa	your kids will only be mad at you if you deny them seeing the grandparents. the only thing you can do is not tell the kids of plans made until the grandparents are at the door to spare their feelings. and also talk to the GPs and let them know how this hurts the kids feelings.|`|SToOdHj1aa	Yeah, that would make me mad too.  Thankfully my parents never did anything like that.  Don't take them out of the kids lives, though.  Just don't tell them in advance if the grandparents have plans for them.  Just let it be a surprise if they do happen to show up, that way they aren't let down if they don't.|`|l3L5eYj4aa	If they live within a short drive, yep, I'd be mad.  Even if they had 100 grandkids I'd be mad.  If they do it all them time, I'd just not invite any more.  If they care, they'll invite themselves or show up.  No sense in getting yourself mad or upsetting your daughter.  No expectations....|`|sr0vZPQqaa	No don't stop them seeing the grand kids but just stop telling the kids they are coming. That way if they don't turn up to things then no one is disappointed.|`|81Ru1OL6aa	yes|`|8dd6860c003f14d0b36d1ccb66ce5531aa	I know exactly how you feel. <br>  My mother in law used to behave in the same way. <br>  but I don't think stopping them from seeing your daughter would be a wise thing to do. <br>  <br>  I think you should sit down with both sets of parents (at separate times of course) and tell them how you feel. But don't be too defensive, because although you have the right to be upset, you don't want to build up any unnecessary tension.  <br>  <br>  I think you should let them know how important they are to your child, and to you, and that you don't want to loose them over something that can easily be sorted out. <br>  Sometimes parents do these things for attention, because like they to feel needed, but you must gently (if not will a little firmness) let them know that you and your partner have priorities to make, and cannot alter your daughter's life to fit their schedule. <br>  <br>  <br>  On second though, upon re-reading your question, I realize that your tether may well have been cut too short to deal with "reasoning". <br>  So you could always try the "silent treatment" for a short period of time, to let them know what it feels like for people they care about to neglect them. <br>  If they can understand the importance of being around family, they should be able to come around. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|LmxUrruZaa	That is ridiculous. Your poor kids are the real victims, especially if you told them that they will come. But it is not your fault at all, so try to control your anger, and don't beat yourself about it.<br>  <br>  I can't believe how irresponsible they are, if they broke a promise to a 5 year old, what lesson does that teach the kids.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you feel this way, and yes, I would be mad as well,|`|jwftwLBTaa	I would be more hurt and upset for my child- that her grandparents could not take the extra time out of their lives to spend a 5th birthday with their granddaughter. Life is too short to make one another angry and upset. TELL THEM how you feel. Let it out and demand an answer! My kids were always the third wheel out in the family, so I know exactly how you feel. But I always told them and not nicely either. They never had a good excuse- it always looked like I had a beef! So, I just never let them in my invites or let them know about milestones. It was much better without the stress! you should do the same!

And no matter if you are a man or a woman, if there is no emotional connection, there is no relationship.  And somebody in that kind of relationship will seek an emotional connection outside of the marriage.  Men need that connection to feel love and to give love.

(without blackmailing anyone)|`|vGCetYmAaa	talk to her about it duhh!|`|S9jyc95jaa	Hmm.  I would probably just go straight to your friend and tell her.  It would be nice to go to the boyfriend and confront him and give him a chance to come clean, but honestly, I know a ton of guys who would use the opportunity to beat you to the punch and tell the girlfriend that YOU'RE the liar.  I would just go straight to your friend; she's the one you owe your loyalty to anyway.|`|AA11510511	Go straight to your friend.

Tell him he needs to come clean to her in the next hour or you are going to do it for him.  Don't just be a rat.  Give him a chance.  Your friend may resent you for telling on him either way.|`|vfHZij52aa	Tell her! You don't want this to ruen your friendship, do you? If you keep it a secret I bet you wont be as close of friends after. Think of it this way...If your boyfriend was kissing/cheating on you, would you want your best friend to tell you?|`|30AVGUXraa	It depends, if he is a descent guy then go to him and give him a chance to tell her himself, but tell him you`ll come forward with it if he doesnt do it right away.<br>  <br>  but if he is a two timing jerk rat him out!|`|B1CH2L26aa	Tell you're friend, in a nice way though, just sit her down and tell her you saw him kiss another girl, and that she has to talk to her boyfriend about it|`|YgGi07Rpaa	Go straight to your friend and tell her.... that is what a true friend would do that is what i would want my friend to do...|`|02hspQaBaa	let it go<br>  its none of your business so leave it be<br>  let them work it out<br>  people hate nosy people and the sooner  a person can figure this out the better|`|2S2onP86aa	Tell you friend.

Those type of women are a dime a doz.If he ends up married to her he will have a long miserable life.
mMLZfxeCaa	Wow. That's harsh. I'm sorry you have to go through this, I've had to deal with friends that have done this to me as well.<br>  <br>  Well, I hate to say it but you can just 'change' her. She is who she is. <br>  The best you can honestly do is sit down and talk with her. Tell her everything you feel, how she treats you and so on. <br>  <br>  But, people change. Sometimes its bad, sometimes its good. This may just be a phase, but it might not be at the same time. Its a part of life. <br>  <br>  I hate to say it, but she doesn't sound like a TURE friend from the sound of it. I dont know, I dont know her side of the story so I'm not judging or anything, but true friends are there for one another through the good and the bad. <br>  <br>  If she decides to not listen to you, or continue treating you like crap, I'd drop her as a friend. <br>  All you can do from there is HOPE that'll pass. <br>  <br>  Good Luck. <br>  And again, I'm sorry that you have to go through it.|`|tnF0zxgqaa	You sound interesting! Do you want to talk to me about it, I normally give good advice! Email me! gindercharlie@ymail.com|`|KyGhcrzLaa	just leave her alone, eventually she will come crawling back to you, and will try to beg for forgiveness|`|nkpRxWLgaa	You can't.  She evidently wasn't happy with herself the way she was.  She's trying to change the person she was into someone she thinks is better.  All you can do is either accept her and love her for who she feels she is now, or choose not to remain her friend if you can't accept her for who she is, now.  She may eventually realize she's not happy with the "new" her and return to who she was before.  I'd say she's probably someone in between...I'd suggest you give her some time to work that out.
RvddYKqjaa	You fell in love because he was the only honest dude, is not love. That's a very little investment in a relationship. If you are happy and your family is happy and everyone is happy, you really don't have a problem. He has no experience at all since you are his first girlfriend, and you love him for his honesty. Sounds like you have everything you need. It's your call. So yeah?<br>  Meant to be? There's no such thing.<br>  An hour ago you were asking strangers if it's true love, and now you're getting married. You make decisions very quickly.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	All that crap about meant to be, true love and soul mates is a bit unrealistic. I had a 10 year marriage of all consuming love and passion and it busted it up. It might of been all that those things at that time, but love is hard and requires work. We didn't even fight that much, but we had different paths to take and love on it's own was not enough to keep us together.<br>  Remember love changes and grows and is hard. I'm sure the guy loves you. Make sure he has the right stuff to mature in a commitment. You sound a bit insecure. Don't rush into it.|`|4UhSXwwlaa	If it's true love, you wouldn't have to ask. If it was, you would know it! You would feel it in your bones. Not that you and your boyfriend don't have something good, it just may not be true love....yet.|`|cB9j7YAQaa	if you feel it is, then i guess so !<br>  <br>  in my eyes however, it just looks like a good-working relationship, i dont know what you're feeling.|`|g5ZkO2fKaa	if you feel it is, then i guess so !<br>  <br>  in my eyes however, it just looks like a good-working relationship, i dont know what you're feeling.|`|EwtCmQctaa	honey, don't say you fell in love with him because he was the only honest man. That just shows us your in love with that aspect of him. <br>  <br>  You fall in love with the person, not because of how honest they are.<br>  <br>  We don't know how you feel and only you can decide if its love or like or lust or friendship. When you are in love it is as if you have your best most trusted friend at your side AND you feel physically attracted to them.<br>  <br>  There is no easy way to find the truth behind your feelings or the feelings of another person but there are some tell-tale signs that love is blooming (or growing deeper). If you agree with 7 of the following 9 statements you are probably in love.<br>  <br>     1. You know, because you have been told by your significant other, that your deep feelings are returned in kind.<br>     2. The object of your affections makes you feel special and good about yourself.<br>     3. If/when you feel jealous it is always fleeting; you trust your partner not to betray you or hurt your relationship.<br>     4. Nothing makes you feel as serene as when you and your partner are together.<br>     5. When you fight with your partner you usually make up within a few hours and you always agree that nothing is more important than you both being able to express your true feelings (even if they sometimes cause conflict).<br>     6. Your partner never asks you to choose between him/her and your loyalties to your family and friends - if you do choose him/her over them you always have a good reason and it is always YOUR decision, and your decision alone.<br>     7. Neither you or your partner feel the need to test the other's loyalties or feelings.<br>     8. You are more yourself when with your partner than you are with anybody else.<br>     9. If sex is part of your relationship it is by mutual desire and agreement without the slightest hint of commitment testing or persuasion.|`|byDqgjaWaa	no i do not think that it is love it is lust that is the way you be when you just meet it might go on for two years who no but do not fall for that it is not true love|`|7C0GcCEVaa	IT IS TRUE LOVE IF U HAVE BEEN GOING OUT WITH JACOB FOR A YEAR....|`|tewptO3Caa	If

m4T0IT0yaa	Honey, it's YOUR life.  Live it the way YOU want to.  Sometimes you don't get the support you need...so give it to yourself.  Go with him.  It's an opportunity of  lifetime!  One you will both share with your children years down the road...GOOD LUCK to you both.|`|18ea4ff1fbd8faac2adc309bdd4c7b45aa	OK. Your pals are acting like creeps because change is hard to accept. It's selfish on their parts. Please don't be upset with them - because it's selfishness based on love for you. You're probably a great friend and terriffic stylist and, well, people love you and want you near.<br>  <br>  Also, there is the fear factor. They're afraid of the unknown - that you'll want to stay in Durbin forever or that Martians will descend and spirit you away to some far-off planet. Who knows? But fear of the unknown is an opportunity to gripe.<br>  <br>  What you might want to do is speak with your salon owner and ask for an extended leave of absence of two to three months. That way, if Durbin is not to your (both you and his) likeing, you can still return to your old chair.<br>  <br>  And make an arrangement with your landlord too - same thing - you'll be gone for 2 months. Yes, that means pay rent for 2 months etc. Be really up front - you'll be out of the country for 2 months (don't say possibly more - just yet) Again, that's so if Durbin doesn't work out - you'll have a place to return to. Same with your utilities, mail, credit card companies, etc. etc. make sure all the people/companies you do business with know you'll be out of the country for 2 months. <br>  <br>  Contact your banker too. Let him know about the 2 month trip. A lot of times banks go ape-dung over unexpected foreign charges to debit and credit cards - and freeze assets.<br>  <br>  Best of luck darling. Don't let the nay-sayers get you down - but please do make sure your employer and your landlord - and all your creditors and bank etc. know you'll be out of the country for 2 months. <br>  <br>  And if Durbin is the place (and the man) of  your dreams - well, then you can stay and make a life there. <br>  <br>  So don't worry about your friends - worry more about your financial life.|`|bf6K6uubaa	they are going to miss you and they don't want to lose you as their friend.  a true friend would be happy for you...but its hard to do that sometimes...especially if they think you are making a bad or rushed decision.  maybe you should talk to them one on one and tell them how you feel and that you want their support.|`|46uiaxPUaa	Maybe they see something that you don't, sit down and ask them to tell you what they are thinking, don't start getting upset at them for what they say!! They may just not want to be without you!|`|6UmRmaeWaa	Well that just stinks! Your friends will miss you and I would be so mad if my friend moved that far....strictly out of jealousy! You must be a wonderful friend to make them want you to stay so badly. Look at it as flattery but in the end it is your choice. It sounds wonderful and if you don't go you may always wonder....what could have happened!<br>  <br>  Have a party here to celebrate your union....then the same there Im sure his fam would love that.<br>  <br>  Here's wishing you all the luck in the world!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT~ An answer to that first person...A true friend would not be happy for you~ they would hate to see you go!
H3WHxCgaaa	I guess you could take a leave of absence but I have a feeling that getting back into that NY salon is going to be tricky...If you can do it, and it's for a short time - why not visit abroad?  Consider it an extended vacation...but only if you can take the time for it.  <br>  <br>  Your friends are probably worried for you - they care - so they don't want to see you go.  <br>  <br>  Have your wedding when and where you'd like it...being a U.S. citizen - I vote for getting married here...it makes the legalities much easier on you.  Good luck with your big decision!|`|wfMC742Naa	This is your life, and you are going to have to ask yourself, "What do I really want, and what is best for ME?"<br>  <br>  This is NOT your friends life, and while you care about their feelings, ultimately this decision affects you far more than it does them.<br>  <br>  You also need to consider your fiance.  How important is this to him?  We he be devastated if you say you won't go?  Will you be miserable if you do go?<br>  <br>  Best Wishes!|`|4kW9ub54aa	Be with him the love of your life.

The world has become much "smaller" through technology and you can communicate with your friends daily plus, they can come visit you in a new country.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and happiness to you.|`|2hLMsZueaa	they luv you and don't want to lose you<br>  i think that's pretty obvious <br>  and since you say your friends are like your family they are also worried about you like you parents would be maybe|`|RpuVwENEaa	If you were with your friends for a long time they might just think that your never going to see them.Tell them that you will Connect  them and that there with you no matter were you go!And believe me that will do it!<br>  P.S- tell them you'll both come and visit!|`|hngrkB2raa	Tell them you'll keep in touch with them as much as you can.Remember:True friends are never apart,maybe in distance but never in heart.|`|P0p2p4utaa	Because they will miss you. I just got married about a month ago and moved from one state to another. My younger sisters where so afraid that they would not see me again or hear from me. So my advice to you is to let them know that this is what you want to do and that you promise you will keep in touch with them. It will be hard for a few days/weeks but the more communication you have with them they will realize that you are happy and will come to terms.
16ffc7ceffd030636adf5aede378a4abaa	Go for it. <br>  <br>  Your other friend might be jealous for a bit but it is her loss. If he rejects you just make sure you keep communication open so he doesn't think you hate him.|`|2xhwKw4aaa	yea but dont do it in a corny way just go up to him and tell him how you feel and just get it over with and out of the way before its too late and your out of school and your never gonna see eachother again...|`|LOY18BKRaa	Whatever you chose to do, remember that there's always a danger that you might lose your best friend, or-as someone's said before- lose them both.|`|UbR9pYrxaa	Most definitely say something before it's too late.|`|Q7rUmJt7aa	Yes you should. you will never get anywhere with him if ya dont start now. So call him up. trust me|`|RlkYCu8taa	Tell him! why not? Maybe he likes you too! You never know, but why not find out? =]|`|QO5xD82xaa	you should talk to your best friend.|`|WvBgXv5daa	no dont break the girl code, dont date your best friends ex|`|QwiGDmqAaa	if you want someone, you dont sit around and pine for them secretly. you jump up and make your move. flirt. start slow, then bring it up a notch. i dunno i thought this was natural for everyone, i guess not. do wat feels right. make eye contact, etc. if its not there stop. you just gotta feel it out. see if theres chemistry, then continue to either persue the relationship or drop it. lifes to short to play games, SHOW him how you feel. and if hes not feelin it, he'll say somethin.|`|ugT8SMheaa	I don't think you should tell him just yet. First, ask your best friend if she has ANY feelings for him left. THIS IS IMPORTANT. If she says no, make your move and tell him you like him. People who have been friends for that long, usually experience feelings for each other eventually. If your friend still has feelings for him, tell your friend you like him too. Point out how they never talk and how maybe she's not to suitable for him. I hope things work out good, and if my advice sucked--follow your heart!! :)|`|BB2xfKwOaa	Yeah...and do it YoUrSeLf!<br>  <br>      ~*~ Good Luck~*~|`|nrZE85MJaa	if you don't how else he would know you have to tell him|`|WQhV4Amgaa	YES! ABSOLUTELY! WHY THE HE DOUBLE L NOT?!?!?!?!? love only happens once girl and if you let your love slip like mine, you'll never be able to love again. don't let your chance to find love slip. take every one you are given! WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU BOYS, GET YO'SELF OUT THERE AND MAKE THEM SOME LUNCH! please.|`|gqHy3821aa	Definately tell him, and ask him if he has feelings for you. Make sure everything is crystal clear no riddles lol.<br>  <br>  Just say 'have you ever thought of me as more than a friend?' and take it from there, the conversation will pretty much write itself after that.<br>  <br>  Be brave enough not to think of the consequences. If you don't ask him you'll just end up regretting it so good luck but remember, you won't be needing it.<br>  <br>  :)|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Dont do this, u sholdnt do that, and dont loose them both, u know it seems that he is not so into u as he is still into yr friend, so dont loose this friendship on something is not finished yet and yr not sure about him as well.<br>  <br>  _K_|`|sgRDJUXqaa	He's your best friend's ex.

naequcqlaa	There is NO need for all you've described that she does NOT do!  I admit I do NOT like housework, BUT I do keep the place clean & neat, & everyone who walks into my home always comments on how neat it looks.  I admit I DO HATE to dust, & yes, that's my ONE downfall.  Other than that, I take it as a personal thing in that it reflects back on me as to how bad the place looks.  If you both work, the one thing I would tell her would be that IF she is NOT going to keep things clean & in at least proper order, that SHE is going to have to pay out of her money to have someone come in & do it for her.  NO, you certainly are not asking too much, not at all.  She's nothing but a slob, & it all reverts back on her & the fact she takes NO pride whatsoever in her own home.  Just tell her you are NOT going to accept the unacceptable, which is totally what this all boils down to.  So if she won't do it, then she w/be the one who w/pay to have someone else come in & do it for her.  There is no reason to have to live in a pig pen just because someone is too plain lazy to pick things up.  You have a very valid reason not to be happy & satisfied w/her lack of just plain having consideration for cleanliness!  Good luck to you...:)|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	No, they never change.  I've been married for 22 years, and you still have to clean out my wife's vehicle with a scoop shovel.  But then, unlike you, I did not marry my wife to be my maid.

Some people are 7's (more aggressive), and others are 3's (less aggressive) and some are 5's (middle of the road).  Over time we all change little by little and get closer to the 5's.  That said - it takes years - and I mean years to get there...so if you lower your expectations now - you'll be better off.<br>  <br>  Oh - one thing you can do to push the point - and maybe she'll get it - take all that crap she leaves around and pile it up under the sheets on her side of the bed.  I'm all for the lived-in look but wrappers and food plates are a no-no even for me (and I am the sloppy one in our house...).  Tell her if she keeps it up - she'll be sleeping with the bugs and mice that are attracted to that stuff.  Ewww.|`|ZzjUHawhaa	if u have tried everything else - then try leaving her and see what she does then. u got to let her know ur serious. little stuff like that is unnecessary. or you can hire a sexy pretty young beautiful maid to clean ur house and i bet she wont like that either. she will open her eyes once she feels threaten by another woman or once u leave out the door. handle ur bizz.|`|wwB3csfYaa	Very fusterating for you.

All I can suggest is that you pick up after yourself and gently reminder her to do so also.  Other than that a good maid service.  I know what you mean though and I sympathies.  My son's girlfriend was the biggest slob I had ever seen in my life.  I mean dirty panties even on the floor.  You didn't know what was clean clothes and what was dirty because it was in a pile in a corner.  The stove and cabinets filthy, dirty dishes everywhere and dust you could write an essay in. My son started out cleaning the house and they he gave up.  They aren't together any more.  I think honestly, he got tired of the mess too.<br>  Red|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	that's disgusting.  You honestly didn't know this before you married her?  Did you never sleep over at her place?  did you never ride in her car?<br>  <br>  She's not going to change.  A slob is a slob. A slob is forever.  It would be different if she was neat and then this is a sudden change.  THEN I'd say she sounds depressed and needs to see someone.  IN THAT CASE, she can change.  But she's a slob.  Slobs never change.  If this is a real issue for you, you really shouldn't have married her.  If you can't ignore it or adapt then get out before you have a kid with her.
bQR2Ld7Eaa	I will tell you, my boyfriend ROCKS in bed and he is chubby. NO he doesn't get tired easily, he can usually perform for 45 minutes to an hour, that includes making out, 4 play, oral sex, and sex. He dominates at oral and it is NO easy feat making me climax, he is usually down there for 20 minutes, before I have one orgasm.<br>  <br>  SEX IS GREAT WITH CHUBBY GUYS!! But, they have to know what they are DOING, that is the key!|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Wow. What a stuck up, stereotypical woman you are. So skinny girls break more easily during sex? Do in shape people excel at thrusting? <br>  <br>  No, "fat" or "chubby" guys don't ged tired easily during sex. My boyfriend is average sized, maybe a little on the bigger side, and he can go for hours. I dated a guy who was as skinny as I am and he couldn't last at all, not to mention he was terrible in bed.<br>  <br>  If you love the person, it doesn't matter how they look or how they perform in bed. It's the sex that counts. If I were him I'm not sure I'd give you any at all, especially if you already had it in your head that I would be bad.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Generally speaking, obese people are less active and will tire out quicker than a person who is thin. However, some obese people have a different body shape and build, so they will always be big. Some of these people are high energy and can outlast even the thinnest people in cardio activities (such as sex). In your situation, you should be able to assess his energy levels by observation before hopping into the sack. If you are still clueless, ask him to jog in the park with you. His response will be a good indicator.|`|F8iYNurEaa	My boyfriend weighed 250lbs (18 stone) when I first met him and he was the best sex that I had ever had. One weekend, I stayed at his all weekend and we had sex 10 times in 36 hours! It was amazing. <br>  <br>  He has since put on another 100lbs (at least!) and he does get exhausted during sex. I think he struggles holding his own weight up! It is still good sex but not as good as when we first got together.|`|94gC814Eaa	Im with a large guy but i find hes great in bed and his performance is great, in fact hes the best ive had.

If he doesn't know what he's doing, his energy level won't matter much anyway.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	No, that's necessarily true. I had always thought so and used to avoid big guys but I fell in love with and married one and he's gives a good show. He does get tired sometimes but the same thing would and has happened to a skinny guy; and guys who have to do all the work all the time, both skinny and chubby, will get winded. I have no problem hoping on top if he gets tired and because his performance is fantastic, it's encouraging to work with him. <br>  <br>  I will say this and people can thumb me down all they want but depending on where the weight is distributed (in the stomach) and the length of his dick, the bigger he is the more trouble he's going to have going deep from any angle except from the back because his stomach will be hindrance. Like I said, my husband is a big guy and he has a little bit of gut, but he's cool. However, we (are/were) swingers and have included big (as in fat) dudes and not being able to go deep was ALWAYS the problem with whomever the guy was and getting winded was rare.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	That's totally not true.<br>  Someone has too much time on their hands making up stories.<br>  Skinny guys can be lousy lovers, it doesn't have to do with body weight.<br>  Maybe if he was super huge but that would apply to every thing I guess.|`|IQ50BJ0Waa	Uh. . .I have a chubby guy and I'm lucky if he's tuckered out after an hour!|`|VSVQHKwKaa	They get tired doing anything.<br>  <br>  The human body was not meant to have all that weight on it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I doubt it.

EdidZdtlaa	lolz wow cool gift but maybe try and get to class before him and put it on his desk. and make someone dosent steal it or anything or maybe if your outgoing sing happy bday to him and then present to to him.and you should get some of those bags from walmart or something and  put all the things in that. you should probably get a big one though. it sounds like you have alot of things. hope i helped!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Give him a hug when you see him and give him the gift.
5b5nQ2cPaa	You have to take a time a talk on how YOU feel. It looks like this relationship is basing more on HIM, him, him.<br>  <br>  In a relationship you gotta communicate, you can't continue it if it's made out of lies. He asks you to say certain things to make him feel better, but you see, he has no regards on how YOU are doing.<br>  <br>  Don't criticize him, as that will make him feel worse and it will sound accusatory. Just talk to him, saying on how you feel, being honest.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, it could be that the both of you need some time to clear your thoughts.|`|bjgs0szFaa	Your BF doesn't seem to have a lot of respect for you, not to mention for himself.  Ditch him.
eN5xA6RKaa	if you mean a night away like at a hotel: if its close to your house go there and make it nice in there, like put candles in there and make it romantic. (if its out of town sometimes you can ask the staff to do things like that, you might have to pay alittle extra but its worth it). buy lingere to wear. you can give him a full body massage while your wearing ur outfit..i did this for my finace on vday and he LOVED it. or just do things that you know he will like, or take him to his favorite resturant or something like that.<br>  <br>  have fun on your getaway!!! :)|`|79wOWoM0aa	Get a hotel room (warning - hot tubs are fun but have negative effects on erections) and put a shower curtain on the bed, and put your own sheet over top, so you can make whatever mess you like on it without ruining the bed.<br>  <br>  Tie him to the bed.  Get a big bottle of lube and goop you and him up real well.  Writh all over him and tease him until he's about ready to lose it.  Then... well... you know what to do.<br>  <br>  Have your way with him for a while... then take a nap when you've both recovered and cleaned up, let him have his fun with you.<br>  <br>  Trust me - most men just want their wives to totally bonk their brains out.  They don't care about candles and soft music.|`|FQxbwbtlaa	tell him your going to a work interview and he needs to be there then tak him for suprise|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Surprise him by using protection?
joGBEnjRaa	awwwww.....what a sad time! well sweetheart the best thing to do is listen! you dont really have to say anything to show your being a good frind,its all about listening? all you can do is be there for her,show her she's not alone etc.just understand that a loss is a horrible thing to deal with but we all get over it at some point,its just new news to your friend but in time it will blow over and she will be getting on with her life.you showing her your a good listener she wont ever forget that,you've proven to be a very good friend ;)|`|ZQzQ48CYaa	I understand the feeling. It can be quite awkward when you don't know what to say. Often body language can show you care and want to help. A hug or something similar. Try saying 'I'm so sorry for you' and being close. If need be, ask her questions about it, and try your best. But it takes a bit of skill dealing with these kinds of situations.|`|k2bNhHhsaa	?huggsss <br>  ?ofer your shoulder<br>  ?do something to get her mind off it<br>  ?get your nails done|`|dXynvbJbaa	hug her.. when im upset i really just want somebody to lean on=) tell her you'll always be there for her=)|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Give her a hug when you see her.

SxctrUuKaa	Arguments like this can be tough! First thing you gotta remember is to stay calm through it all and as much as you hate it at times you have to remain civil. I went through this with my parents for a long time. Most of the time it was because my mom was unhappy and my dad was unhappy and who better to gripe at then me. I was always in the path of destruction. As for getting blamed that comes from a person that cant aknowledge blame themselves, They can do something wrong and its easier to blame someone certain then find out what really happened. Especailly if your brother isnt around as much. If you havent done anything wrong then dont worry about it. That sounds hard because you want to defend yourself, but as you can tell the truth always comes out that you are the innocent one. Just keep reminding your parents that you are getting tired of being blamed. Maybe one day they will see exactly where you are coming from! Good luck! =)|`|YQhFTkdbaa	Sorry to say this but there is nothing you can do.<br>  Maybe act really upset by it one day, like majorly upset and then when asked what's wrong, burst into tears and tell them all of this?<br>  Parents are just like this im afraid. I have 4 older brothers and i get blamed ror everything. You just got to live with it untill you move out lol <br>  good luck xx|`|PpakisLAaa	i dealt with the same problem n whenever i proved them wrong we used to laugh "when in doubt blame steve" cuz of the old fresh prince joke "what is that like like the theme of this family .when in doubt blame will." 1 time they even woke me up to ask me if i stole my grandmothers remote trashin through my room it'll get better truust me|`|JKERXFuiaa	:| no dont run away.<br>  <br>  try talking to them again,  but make sure you let them know how serious you are about this and make sure you tell them how unhappy this situation is making you.<br>  <br>  if that doesnt work then you could always find outside help, i.e. go to a school counsellor or something to try and talk things through. <br>  <br>  but good luck. :)|`|mRGfLpwyaa	run away|`|SR1FN2nqaa	had a lil sister that used to try to get me in trouble with my parents like this...i beat her *** every freakin day ....yeah, it was wrong , but hey she got what she deserved.|`|VWZPAWUMaa	Be very patient. Ignore the fights. Eventually, your parents will find someone to throw their frustrations at. Don't worry. I know how it is to be in a similir situation; just remember that you'll grow out of the house in no time. Good luck!
QxA29Y2Naa	I am firm believer that people can work through anything...with a little bit of help.<br>  <br>  But if he is on medication and it affects him in this way, I don't think he can change. And I don't think he should go off of his meds.<br>  <br>  So the question is, Can you change and do you want to? You are right those behaviors are not healthy. I applaud you for realizing that. But you need counseling if this going to work. <br>  <br>  If you - or he - doesn't want to try counseling, I say to break it off. Emotionally unstable relationships don't make for good communication - and that is what is required for the relationship long haul.<br>  <br>  I see that  you both haven't known each other long. If you realize he is not the right fit for you emotionally, why do you want this to work so badly? This is not for you to answer to us, just think about it for yourself.|`|2PCksILraa	Why don't you talk to him about it?<br>  And don't expect your honey to change if he doesn't want to. If it's a meant to be relationship, you wouldn't find anything major about him that should change. A lot of divorces happen because one wanted to "fix" the other.|`|NBErRe8Saa	if hes around for you thats all you should be concerned about, because hes emotionally flat doesn't mean hes gunna beat you, and putting yourself in compromising situations just to prove a point is wrong and selfish.|`|XhWoAGYAaa	This relationship is doomed. Sorry
y4XOGjPPaa	Not only is it wrong, it is potentially illegal.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	If either of those two are your friend, you would not be wrong to state your opinion. That mean a loss of contact.  So be it.  At least it will be off your consciousious for having tried.|`|AA11185479	She's probably just bragging, flattering herself that an older guy likes her so she can seem more adult.<br>  If she really believes it, then she's being dangerously naive.  She might be misreading his actions, thinking his friendliness is really flirtation, or thinking his sexual predation is romance.<br>  <br>  Guys that age don't have much in common with girls her age, so he's really only interested in her sexually.  He's old enough to know that it is illegal for him and unhealthy for her, so he is putting his own lusts ahead of her best interests.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Yeah its wrong, because 90% of the time all the 21 yr old wants is sex and she ends up with a broken heart and maybe even pregnant. When I was 21 there was a 15 yr old who had a crush on me, but I knew better and didn't do anything. All you can do is tell your friend its wrong and let her make her own mistakes. Or better yet tell her parents.|`|KGRikkJeaa	i think its wrong. thats way too young to even consider anything...thats actually considered rape if they do anything whether its consentual or not, the mother of the 15 year old can take this to the police station IF anything happens like kissing or even dating. thats not right...If she was 21 and he 27 then yea but at 15 thats too young even for another 15 year old|`|4EWCegiRaa	I don't know if I would say it's "wrong" but I think it's stupid, ignorant, and potentially dangerous.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Why are you getting all bent out of shape over this? Whether it's true or not it really isn't going to affect you. Don't worry so much about it.|`|MYPMoVg4aa	Okay so that's 6 years difference and she's still a minor, underage teenage. in a lot of sense this is wrong but once she turns 16 it probably isn't as bad, so maybe she should wait. But for now being fifteen and all she should probably stay away from grown men.
IXskJPlVaa	Technology and advancement has no bearing on divorce rate - it is education and family which effect. The standard of education has deteriorated and now education is thought as a means of making money nothing beyond. The negative impact is more pronounced as we have more greed and want to own everything being offered on the market - pushing us further in the race for money and un never ending desire, we can blame this on advancement. A hefty price to pay. Best of luck.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	A sense of independence may be developing in the relationship as a result of one learning how to cope without the assistance of a significant other.  Rather than to make the positive results achieved by one available to the other  partner, the learned person would assume a superior attitude to the perceived to be inferior partner.  The friction begins when they both begin to recognize the inequality and neither is willing to rectify the situation.|`|cp30vrVoaa	Technology that's used for entertainment will do just that - entertain people.<br>  Technology that's used in the field of medicine will accelerate medical advancements.<br>  There is no technology that was designed for advancing family ties, at least I haven't heard of any yet.<br>  <br>  Just like with anything, it depends what the purpose of the design or technology is. If there's no technology to advance marriage ties then marriage ties won't be improved by any technology.<br>  <br>  Actually, correlating  the current divorce rate with the advancement of technology might be a bit of a stretch. One might argue that they are not connected in any way.|`|AA11707529	technology has nothing to do with human emotion, and that's what love is -- human emotion. people get divorced when that love fades.|`|4EWCegiRaa	Technology changed how we intereact with the world... it's the worst in people that made the interactions poor.|`|U5KIOutnaa	i dont fin d a realtopn b/w dem|`|lxouDjtqaa	"people become more and more advanced"<br>  Well, not really, they have more free time and/or are able to do more. Technology will not improve people unless they allow it to, and even then it has it's limitations.<br>  <br>  Technology has aided many marriages and even created some.|`|lVIdENvqaa	People jump into marriage too quick, either to get away from demanding  or abusive parents. or they marry thinking that life will be a bed of roses.<br>  They have an unreal mental picture of what marriage is. It's not marry, have kids, and live happily ever after. After marriage, and kids, there is no living happily unless you are with a mate who is caring, loving and helpful. I hear so many married couples argue nowadays over stupid matters. They just don't seem to care about each others feelings.<br>  After so many years of that, one will get tired of the abuse and leave.<br>  So, marriage is what you make it. You can make it a loving relationship for the rest of your life, or you can make it a living hell.|`|x7FjDcjzaa	WTF?

gtgQKDW3aa	Because most teenage relationships don't end well. After a while when an adult sees a teenage couple together they think more about WHEN it will end instead of IF it will end because they've seen so many teen couples split. It's also because most of them have been through a relationship, probably when they were a teen, that they thought was love and ended badly.<br>  Being in love has nothing to do with experience, it's knowing when you're in love that does.<br>  Also, adults, and people in general, have problems with being stubborn. Don't try to argue with them, you wont get anywhere. The only way you can shut them up is by physically proving them wrong (getting married). But don't do it just to prove people wrong, do it for love and make sure it's the right person. :)|`|4EWCegiRaa	No, they don't think you're an empty shell.  But things will change for you and you'll learn some things along the way and before know you it, you're on a whole new level of love that you never even knew existed.<br>  <br>  And often times, teens feel like they know more than they know.  I was the guy in high school that had his life together and was going places and if anyone knew something, everyone knew I would know it.  But looking back, I didn't know half as much as I thought.<br>  <br>  Also, it's that "i know what love is" stubbornish makes you sound ignornat.  As an adult, you learn that you don't know everything and you don't know everything.  What you're saying implies that you know everything about love.  Thinking you know is a very dangerous thought.<br>  <br>  --->  It's not that you don't know anything, it's that you don't know everything.  And it's the things you don't know that are the most dangerous of all.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  It's not so black-and-white.  Maybe they should be saying "you don't know enough about love to make as much of an informed decision as you would like to believe".  It's all about make smart decisions.|`|RqTC18NFaa	I think what most adults mean is that, until you've had the life experience and been in a few serious relationships, its difficult to really "know" what love is until you have experienced it for yourself.  Its not a put-down, its a fact, really.  It applies to other things, to-like being a good driver, things like that.  It just takes a little time to get some experience and more importantly, perspective.|`|zKrkLeIIaa	Maybe there are very few teenagers who do know what love is, (they must be quite mature) along with some adults who don't know what love is, but they mostly say that out of generalization. That's the point, we don't have as much experience and anyone can say they are in love when it's simply infatuation. Our tests for each other, and "commitment" isn't on a deep enough level. Now we CAN fall in love, but along with our General (not individual) naivity, that can be ruined instantly. Adults can make these same mistakes, but since they're at the peak to get married and are into more serious, long term relationships, they consider themselves to be in love while your relationships, which are seen as petty, are not. Of course they understand that we have emotions, they just don't realize that not all of us are the same.|`|KgKAFvEBaa	Just Me Being Me hit it right on the nail.<br>  <br>  Yes, you may know "what" love is, but unfortunately teens confuse the hormonal lust with love and this is where the adults get off saying that.

What he is doing is definitely inappropiate and wrong.<br>  <br>  The best hting to do right now is talk to oyur mother and tell her what is happening and she may be able to make him stop, talk to him and tell him enough is enough.<br>  <br>  Finally talk to your school counseler and they will be able to advise you on what he is doing and what you should do (i.e. contact socail services).<br>  <br>  Under no circumstances let him do any of this again, tell him to og away and this isnt for oyur safety, try and lock the door when you change and hit is hand away when he touches.<br>  <br>  This sounds like molestation and you should take immediate action.|`|SR1FN2nqaa	THIS HAS TO BE A JOKE. how can you even ask such a preverted question like this....totally , you know its wrong and if you let it to continue to happen without saying anything to anyone your just as sick as your dad. i mean really, did you tell your ma or someone you trust ?|`|aiNY0uVnaa	Why would you even ask something like that?!<br>  He says all those things to you because maybe he expects you to not be that smart to realize it's NOT RIGHT.<br>  <br>  So go! Do something about it, it might be hard because he's your dad and all, but DO SOMETHING BEFORE IT GETS TOO FAR.|`|ml2FDYECaa	Are you for real??? You need to talk to someone about this.

kfWi9ZkEaa	This child, aged 9, is sexualised.  This means his dad has probably molested him.  He's touching you up as a matter of habit, having seen/learned something he's too young to naturally have seen/learned.  Get help for him.  Tell social services, this is not funny.  Nine-year-old boys do NOT touch girls up, at all.  They'd rather have their hand cut off.  If he's doing it to you it's a REALLY, really bad sign.<br>  <br>  As to your problems;<br>  <br>  Thank GOD and all his angels that you get to leave one day;<br>  <br>  tell your mother that some chick reckons the kid is being molested because he's molesting you.  Tell her in private (stepdad sounds like a pedo anyway.  You're lucky he thinks you're unattractive.  Or perhaps he knows your real dad would kill him, so this is how he copes with not being able to do creepy things to you.  Remember, the world is a far more disgusting place than most kids realise);<br>  <br>  Talk to your dad anyway: even though he's in jail, he's taking responsibility for you and will find a way to help - even if it is only to listen.  Don't underestimate your dad just because he's in prison.  He's a big boy, he can handle bad news.|`|lc51V6EAaa	stick up for yourself!! make him mad!!! if he hits you? good then you can get him in trouble!!!|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	so, which is it , your dad molesting you or your step-brother? at least tell the same story or are you just making this all up? i think the latter.....<br>  i feel for your step dad and brother......|`|ZeYYHByTaa	well i think you need to sit down with your mother and explain how you feel about all of this. if she doesnt listen threaten to call the social services and go into a home.|`|AA11644770	go to a police station tell them , they will contact the social services , but id try telling your mum first , she might throw the moron out|`|ehvUYsgLaa	how old are you?<br>  <br>  because you sound old enough not to call you dad 'daddy'...sounds like your a brat!|`|zXJWV7eCaa	Sara<br>  <br>  First let me tell you that I am a survivor of sexual abuse by "my father".<br>  <br>  I strongly urge you to open up all to your mum.  The fact that you mention love for your mum, does suggest, she is a good mother, so tell her.<br>  <br>  YOU ARE NOT A BAD PERSON. THIS NEEDS TO STOP NOW!!!!<br>  <br>  If you find yourself panicking to explain things, write all that has happened down, ok?<br>  <br>  Please, please don't keep this to yourself.  <br>  <br>  I wander if your stepbrother has also experienced abuse from his father?  You say he is 9, well, he had to have learnt it from somewhere, would you not agree?  Then you say how your stepfather is doing things to your mum in front of you!  Sweetie, this is all abuse and you are not the one who is in the wrong!<br>  <br>  Just because they have been together for years, does not give him the right to abuse his authority.<br>  <br>  TELL YOUR MUM. SHE CANNOT HELP YOU IF SHE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. SHE IS NOT A MIND READER!<br>  <br>  I hope to hear from you again with positive news or you are most welcome to email me.<br>  <br>  A concerned survivor|`|UhY60Kcraa	i know how you feel. my dad has been dating this girl for years and shes such a *****, and if i am pissy to her my dad will take her side. I just sorta have to deal with it, and when im really mad i just stay a few extra days at my moms. im really sorry, maybe you can stay with another family member.|`|dpCsTIEIaa	Well hon, if all this is true, then you need to talk to your mom about it and how it is affecting you. If she doesn't listen then try talking to a relative about it. That is definitely not a good situation for you or your mother to be living in.|`|USpC9A1Xaa	I am sorry for your father|`|8lwGjvQpaa	that almost sounds like a lawsuit, at least not normal, tell grown ups|`|tgAGqwD6aa	i dont like your step dad... >:(<br>  lol|`|L2Oct8GBaa	Tell your mom in private and also let her know if she doesn't do something about it you plan on going to the children's aid or the school principal because you want something done about this and if she loves you she will do something. Also tell your grand parents. Your step father should not be touching your mother inappropriately in front of you either and your mother shouldn't allow it. When does your Dad get out of jail? You need to also tell him what is going on. Your parents have the responsibility to protect you. Shame on your mother for allowing this to go on. I am a mother too and re-married and there is no way i would allow my child to be mistreated, she comes first.|`|b146bf3f7e2e162a7266cd68a0222d22aa	Thats sounds messed up, whatever you do find someone to talk about it and never keep your anger bottled up (Childline can be helpful).  Your stepdad sounds like a bully, but remember while he may sound cocky and confident, really he has low self esteem, so to fill that empty space in his worthless soul he picks on you.  As for your step brother, his touching is inappropriate and he could progressively get worse if this behaviour is not tackled.  You've done nothing wrong so don't be scared to speak up.  Wish I could help more. Good luck and stay strong!|`|WXdMHMfwaa	have you told your mother any of this? <br>  <br>  You probably should, because it seems like youre in a bad situation. If you are uncomfortable you mother should know and she should respect your thoughts and feelings as well...|`|EunkYJ5Baa	hi hun didnt you ask the same ? if it was right that your dad touches you? you need to tell a adult an get help you r stuck in a hell hole an the only way to get out is to tell someone hun xxxx|`|fRufnTstaa	call the cops.|`|0bXFK3AEaa	didn't you just ask a question about your dad touching you about 5 min ago?|`|W8v86HYoaa	this is mental abuse<br>  tell him to f off, he's not your father and never will be. Tell him he can call you that all he wants, if he wants to drive a wedge between you and your mum then fine<br>  speak to your mum about it, make your opinions clear and say although you respect that she loves him you cannot take anymore of him. If the worst gets to the worst, say you don't wanna make her choose between you but if he continues to do this then you will force her too. That should make her take you more seriously<br>  I'm sure your not ugly hunny, this guy probably has issues himself. My father was like this, and you're lucky that yours isn't although obviously he cannot really help just now.<br>  I'm hoping you'll resolve this|`|YQhFTkdbaa	Okay, all the adults are saying to tell you Mum. But she won't listen.<br>  HIT UR STEP BROTHER.<br>  It will get the point across to him and threaten to tell them what he is doing, also if u can get some stuff on him to use as blackmail.<br>  As for ur step dad. Step dads are b**tards. Mine was anyway.<br>  I just stayed away from him as much as possible and argued with him quite a lot.<br>  <br>  He soon started to leave me alone, and u know what, he is probably jealous of u and ur Mothers relationship. Don't let ur step dad see it effects you. He will do it more if he can, do try hold it in and talk to ur friends about it<br>  Good luck XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

cifLm7Nraa	That's like the saddest thing i've ever heard. <br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure i've been in this situation before and it sucks. It's a sticky situation that's for sure. Ask your (girl)best friend if she likes him back, cause if she doesn't than you've got nothing to worry about. <br>  <br>  Maybe take a little break from them for awhile, see what develops. Talk to the guy and see what's really up|`|hUYaaXBvaa	hmm well i don't know (if you two decided to date) that you could trust him<br>  although you have a friendship bond, so he might have more cause to stay with you, this guy seems to be interested in alot of girls at once- his girlfriend, your friend, he  could act the same towards you<br>  i would be wary he seems to be flirty, and its not really great he dismissed his own girlfriend by feighning she didn't exist- ie isn't important to him<br>  but you know him better than me so its your call|`|3y0w1qIBaa	You may have to let go and find another guy who can make you happy.  If you cross the line, you could lose the friendship of your best friend and your best guy friend.
lGBbWsuSaa	Umm no. I dont care at all. Guys dont even look that closely at girls lol. Usually if a girl has a nice personality...a guy wouldnt even notice unless u told him. If a guy did care about it that much..then hes prolly shallow.

Nice guys do not need trophy girls.|`|faOBk7qtaa	I personally do not like cellulite. It is a big turn off for me. I like small firm petite bodies, that is my preference.

Thats good.|`|869006a5155635267f2ca324a4ad2a56aa	well no not particularly, that just leads me to think u probably got alright curves, and a lil bit of cellulite is completely overlookable, most guys will notice but pay no attention, so dont worry. Dont bother trying to hide it. Stretch maks u cant tell , some guys are more superficial so u never no.  But on the whole no, ur fine.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	..as long as everything is remotely well adjusted and in significant balance...including the womans security factor?....she'll do just fine really.<br>  We guys aren't so that superfiscial that we can object to a woman with a few imperfections...how callus of us if we do sweet sister..agreed?|`|87e42b12d9375f23a7f6007b19387ae4aa	no because generally that means they have a nice shapely @ss. as long as the rest of their body isnt fat im ok with a little extra in the butt area. if shes still hot, and not a fat, no problem with it in fact i encourage it.|`|vuDE5TPbaa	I don't care. It doesn't say ANYTHING about the person you are. They are the last thing I care about in a girl as far as physical attractiveness goes.<br>  <br>  If you have them, don't worry, I am sure you are still hot.|`|aAxIERtUaa	it's all economics|`|sCCjAKllaa	That sounds fine to me.|`|GFiKQIGpaa	stretch marks = NO|`|Qe95LNxYaa	i rather be drinking witch i am doing now|`|16ffc7ceffd030636adf5aede378a4abaa	You should not sleep with a guy who is going to judge you on something so small. If you were to get undressed and the guy stopped because of the cellulite then he was obviously a mistake. <br>  <br>  My personal choice would be that it wouldn't bother me. Probably means you have a big butt and that'ss always a good thing. <br>  <br>  If it really bothers you though you can use cocoa butter or some other lotions specifically meant for stretch marks and cellulite to make it go away.|`|2xhwKw4aaa	no and yes it kinda depends on who the guy is and what their type is, it also matters about how you feel about yourself... if you have stretchmarks just put a little cocoa butter on them after you take a shower and they'll go away after a while of using it... you can find cocoa butter at any general store really and there are small and large bottles... sorry if i didn't help any!?|`|DZpjqMNsaa	well if i see a girl in the street and i look at them im gona be looking at there face and body not there stretch marks on there thighs.<br>  if u see a girl would u walk up 2 dem and say do u have streatch marks? XD|`|FWUSLQN2aa	It hasn't bothered any guy that i have dated, or even my hubbie now, they've seen we in suits, and still wanted to date me. I think talking about it, and actually seeing the girl  your interrested in are two diffrent things.|`|tYnpVHpZaa	opposite actually. It don't matter if you are a bit over as long as you don't have that fluffy cellulite crap, that stuff is gross.|`|DakrypCvaa	i would like to know as well. i have cellulite and i always feel self-conscious about it. it always seems like no one else has it. i am quite skinny and i run a lot, but it does not go away.|`|SVPFyBNaaa	yeah the cellulite is definately a turn-off but i can't see how a skinny girl would have thigh fat and stretch marks. she'd still be hot though.|`|TCCgtrrJaa	Ive seen very pretty girls with cellulite and it doesnt mean there fat or ugly they just need to work out more the butts..|`|642d31f48073a651ec790aef08754fe9aa	when your pregnant u get strech marks just put some cocoa butter lotion on your hips every day after u take a shower and they will go away|`|NGeOkoNFaa	not only does thyr looks matter but also their personality for me....<br>  if ths girl has a good personality..i would say ya|`|V12HSfNAaa	No they don't mind, unless they are huge asshol** obviously.|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	it wouldn't bother me|`|sZ53glP4aa	i don't think it matters really|`|kfM7ppWpaa	I have noticed it on women before.

Stopped calling & texting as much as he used to<br>  2. accused me of cheating constantly (guilty conscious)<br>  3. didn't want to have sex as much<br>  4. he was working late! yeah right!<br>  5. hanging out w/ the "boys" more <br>  6. not answering his phone!<br>  7. excuses his phone was dead,No signal, i fell asleep<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?7-Signs-He-Is-Cheating&id=885222" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?7-Signs-He-Is-...</a>|`|CaRKCpMqaa	Not as easy as people are making out. My boyfriend cheated on me and I didn't find out till a week later. Id say suspicious behavour maybe just pick up his phone to play with it and see if he jumps for it back, that will show if he's hiding anything. Also being less effectionate or sometimes overly effectionate. Going out with 'friends' and not making contact with you while out.<br>  Good Luck|`|tA8T4QYFaa	He keeps peaking at the answers, ha ha ha ha.<br>  <br>  Actually, if you think he is, then he is, time for you to move on. Because if he isn't, you're paranoid and controlling, and he shouldn't be with you.|`|Yl0ehKj1aa	If you catch him<br>  if he dont touch u anymore(Like if u two have had sex but u two dont no more)<br>  If he seems distant from u fro some reason <br>  When u ask for his phone he act like he dont want u to see it <br>  If he tells u<br>  If he no longer has anytime for u|`|UP33GlBwaa	He becomes an a**hole and you just feel it.  He doesnt want to kiss you anymore or really want you.  He becomes a total jerk and starts flirting with every girl (in front of you).|`|qSSiV0mmaa	I think it is something like 90% of the time when you suspect someone is cheating, they are. But always get proof before you accuse him.|`|JQZzI49Paa	Better check his phone. I clean up after myself when I do it. So email me if you need the signs of it.|`|fmkwdNJyaa	when he is unavailable, putting you off and not showing much interest in you|`|V12HSfNAaa	First signal of cheating would be a... change in behavior... Imagine that your boyfriend saw you 6 times a week and was always eager to see you...then suddenly he just starts seeing you 3 days a week and isn't that eager to see you. That could mean that he's just not that into you right now and that he's thinking about someone else. When a man loses interest in you, it's never a good sign. The second signal of cheating would be him talking about too much of a certain girl for example. If he shows any type of fascination or if he's too quick to flatter this girl, it can't be good. Third signal of cheating could be for example, your boyfriend starting to cancel dates with you or standing you up at the last minute. and another signal of cheating could be him starting to frequent too many times the same bar or club without inviting you...perhaps there's a good reason to go there? So stay focused and if he's putting his hand on the candy jar, go there and slam that hand of his! Good luck to you sweetie :)|`|fb24jk9Caa	he usually has random anger outbursts towards you. or he's paranoid, doesn't want you going through his stuff. or he thinks YOUR cheating, he has this unnecessary jealousy towards the other guy friends in your life. you can just kinda tell, you guys arent spending the same amount of time you use to or talking as much as you use to.|`|t3ST550qaa	Listen to your gut and follow up when your head is telling you things. Don't just dismiss your thoughts and call yourself crazy. If you pay attention to your instincts they will lead you to the truth.|`|2qqQFgLDaa	He is distant, get's annoyed easily, doesn't want to touch you, always has plans that don't include you.|`|MxHRjPFHaa	he studders alot when you ask him ????  or he gets mad at you for asking them...he gets home late and always has a excuse for it...|`|AFXoB8txaa	well do you think he's cheating......???<br>  <br>  well he cheating ..........well it is wut it is.....|`|mywtmSROaa	See if he shows signs of disinterests in you.|`|SVqjzEE3aa	when he doesn't want you around his phone or myspace or any way he can get contact info....orr........if you get his phone and look at his messages and contacts..and if he acts differently towards you..|`|heMWDrLnaa	you just know. trust youre insticts.
srAP6Vzvaa	what you should do is go to him. eye to eye. not over the phone. tell him you made a huge mistake. that you regret it 120% and that you will never cheat on him again if he gave u a 2nd chance. AGAIN dont do this over the phone or on some email. Sincerity must be proven face to face. If he says No then you have to live with the bad decision you made. it's part of taking responsibility for being a s''lut.|`|xPZm0Mxlaa	I sorry to say cheating hurts if you are a guy or a girl. I am 80% sure my wife cheated on me but I have no Prof . We have 2 kids and that's why I my still with my wife.She distorted  our closeness  Forever I don't think I will ever be as close to her as I once was. It was over 6 years ago and I Still think about it a a lot. In fact as soon as our kids get old enough I tkink I am going to leave her and move on with my life|`|heMWDrLnaa	honestly, he's too good for you. you don't deserve him because cheating is absolutely by no means acceptable under any circumstances !|`|sXU3RrfWaa	You likely wont.  Trust is hard to earn and even harder to get back once it's lost. Mistakes happen, but if he isnt interested anymore, who can blame him?|`|C2awohDFaa	cheat on him more, then he will get jelouse and go back to you|`|3RlGLPVqaa	I don't mean to blame you, but you should have never cheated in the first place. It's really hurtful (I know that from experience...)<br>  <br>  You have 3 options:<br>  <br>  A) Move on<br>  <br>  B) Try to slowly get his trust back, and then tell him you still love him (this could take a lot of time though)<br>  <br>  C) Apologize in a way that he will TOTALLY have to believe you and take you back<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|2qqQFgLDaa	Tell him you are sorry. Give him space and do not keep on and on. DO NOT BEG! It makes them run further. What are you missing in your relationship that made you do this? Trust is the hardest thing to win back.|`|EiGc45Zwaa	Nothing...u lost his trust and cheated on him. your fault, deal with it. if he wants you back i think he is just a desperate guy. he deserves a person better than you <br>  and advice to your ex-bf  "dont get back together with her"|`|Sj43jo3vaa	APOLOGIZE..APOLOGIZE..APOLOGIZE..APOLOGI...<br>  <br>  <br>  AND REMEMBER WHY HE FELL FOR YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE|`|udPtqagzaa	You cheated on him. I'm sorry, but mistakes have consequences. At least you can walk away with the knowlegde never to hurt a guy like that again.|`|eqplcqJjaa	Well I wouldn't really trust you. I would be heartbroken if you did this to me if I were your boyfriend.|`|fq1NgFKXaa	hes tooo good for you move on to low life you deserve!|`|4kfljeIGaa	Try sending a note of sincere apology.  Doing it won't guarantee that he'll come back to you, but it will likely make you feel better.  Also, if he has been privately longing for you, he may be more likely to consider going back if you've made your amends.
UP33GlBwaa	If he doesnt want to get back together with you because all his past relationships were that sexual, then that is just lame.  You told him if you were together then you would want that and then he said, no not right now.  That is friggin crazy.  Get away from him.  He was using a line on you to get you to do sexual acts.  Guys are so easy to understand if you just read between the lines.  If he really cared about you he would never say something like that and he should respect the fact that you are a decent girl and love that about you.  Sounds like he's a little confused and I wouldnt give him anything at all.....not my time and definitely not sex.  You go girl!|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	If your life depending on your ability to write a grammatically correct paragaph, could you do it?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsP8bkWuOSvjMIm8sT_gmprsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223120539AAjc5Zk">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ojiO3svoaa	IS EVERYONE ON HERE LIKE 16 TODAY?

If it is meant to be he will come back.|`|mywtmSROaa	STAY AWAY! Your gonna end up hurt. Ex's ALWAYS come back and if your reason for breaking up was solid, then themes no need to reassess the damage. I know it hurts cause he's your first but its not worth it.|`|J86kG2GWaa	Stay away! He basically just told you that he wants to use you! If he really cared about you like that, then he would want to go out with you without strings attached, but he made his intentions known first hand.|`|5AZ9cSeTaa	I know first kisses are kind of a big deal but i really wouldn't go back out with him cause chances are that he will probally just dump you once he gets what he wants|`|sZ53glP4aa	sounds like he's just trying to get some sex, don't let him pressure you into anything go at your own pace. If he doesn't like that then tell him to get f****d. thats my advice|`|QtX2aB0daa	well. if he wants to do somehting sexual with you..he obv. is still attracted to you..so i say take im' back|`|Yl0ehKj1aa	i mean if u really like him and want to be with him take him back...But if you dont want to be with him then leave him alone. But i wouldnt wait for him forever because he did say he didnt want to get with u right now but i guess u two should tlk and just take it slow for a while.

If he says that he just wants to get sexual with you that is probably all he does want.  Even if than he denies it.  It really sounds like you guys have to work this out yourself though.  If you do get back with him though, be careful he may really only want to use you.|`|ITDYuHvPaa	It's pretty obvious that he only wants one thing from you.  He is trying to manipulate you into feeling bad for him and putting out.  Don't do that!  If you're not ready for all of that, then don't do it!  Don't let him pressure you.  Someone who truly likes you would not expect you to do all of that.  He's just looking for a booty call.  Stay away.  The heart is wrong sometimes.  Wanting sex from you is not the same thing as wanting to be with you.|`|j7o7RsZKaa	give him one chance NOW tell him to take it or leave it... if he says no tell him thts it and move on dont wait!|`|RvddYKqjaa	He said it all. He just wants to have sex with you. Is that OK by you? If so, go for it. Personally I would run the other way as fast as I could.
mPxYJ7a6aa	Don't wear anything|`|POHWTDPRaa	If you look like a slut you are going to attract boys who like sluts, which will make you an actual slut. It really warms to heart to see a little girl with such big dreams. I have a crystal ball for dumb teenagers, you know. I see you working as a stripper until you are 27 and too coked out to be a big draw anymore. After that, you'll spend the rest of your days asking people if they would like their meal Super Sized.|`|twVyisGnaa	You don't need to show off your stuff to get boys.  Try personality.

I want to be able to imagine whats there and not know without bohtering to imagine. tight pants are okay, but i dont really care for em.

kUE3Ddktaa	I love casual-but-nice clothes on men for outdoor weddings. My favorite look is a tan/khaki-colored suit in a light cotton or poplin with a crisp white or light blue shirt underneath. Add a great solid tie for a little more formality, or go with no tie for a little less. The jacket dresses it up.<br>  <br>  But if the goal is to let the guys wear something they already own, almost every man has a nice pair of khakis, a white oxford shirt, and a tie in his closet - an outfit like that will save them a lot of money and you a lot of headaches!|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	well, what are you colors? would khaki go with them or clash?  when in doubt, always go with black pants, they match anything<br>  <br>    my fiance and i are having an outdoor wedding and he is going to The Buckle and buying one of those sweet long sleeve button up shirts that have stuff embroidered on them.  our colors are black, red, and white so it will be easy for him to pick one that is his style and our colors.  then he is just wearing that over black pants|`|HJ0YTWjVaa	I think Khaki pants is a great idea for an outdoor wedding. I think that casual comfortable weddings are more fun and relaxed. Don't use a lot of decorations the trees, flowers, etc is enough. Buy off of ebay.

I would suggest a cruise since they have great deals and you can see alot of places.<br>  Staying in U.S. what about the Florida Keys? I grew up there and it's so beautiful. Like going to the carribean but cheaper and closer!<br>  Or Texas. San Antonio is great, and you can stay on the Riverwalk. It's very romantic with lots to do and nice hotels along the water. You could do that for a few days, then rent a car and go to Austin because there is great live music and tons of things to do outdoors. <br>  Or even Fredericksburg, and stay in a bed and breakfast.|`|7u42U7raaa	Laguna Beach California. <br>  <br>  I've never gone without seeing a dolphin, the shops and eateries are great.

Hawaii, Florida, California, for sunny places. New Jersey is the bomb but i think it will still be a bit cold in may|`|b1xQKDEraa	las vegas, miami or florida, california. They all have nice weather. what about atlanta or new york? There are so many places in the USA to visit.|`|PH1eFiqwaa	The Poconos are a beautiful place for a honeymoon.|`|cLrY0O4Uaa	New York, New York! There is so much to do there to suit all tastes!|`|HrttKKySaa	My husband and I went to Camano Island in Washington State. They have two great bed an breakfasts on this big island (you don't have to take a ferry or anything, you drive on) We went to the Camano Blossom Bed and Breakfast, the owner is really sweet. One of my best friends went to the Camano Bed and breakfast, they apparently have in room hot tubs and such. I didn't know they went there until after we chose our location! haha It's a really nice, quiet island, but not too terribly far to go place, and visit anacortis and such cute towns.|`|VP5bXfOLaa	St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands is pretty inexpensive. Since it's a part of the U.S. you won't need a passport. I looked up plane tickets for there a couple weeks ago for May and they are about $300 a piece.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  It totally depends on where you live....if you want to fly or drive.....and how much you want to spend.<br>  <br>  Really, any of the National Parks are nice Yellowstone, Mt. Rainier, the Grand Canyon.<br>  <br>  If you want to just chill, relax and "beach it"....then head to Florida or Hawaii.<br>  <br>  If you want to have the "city life" head to New York or San Francisco.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Myrtle Beach in South Carolina, just make sure it isn't spring break it should be over by May.  Suggest someplace warm so go south<br>  <br>  Hawaii, the virgin Islands and New York are super expensive.  To me if 1 dinner costs 40-50 dollars, thats expensive<br>  <br>  We went to Aruba where in the better restaurants fresh fish was 10 dollars a plate, that's more my style.  Myrtle Beach is more than Aruba but no where near those other places<br>  <br>  if you aren't really into the beach because in May it will be chilly, but Martha's Vineyard is fantastic.  It's in Massachusettes, you need a ferry to get there.  Its very small, easy to get around the towns and all the towns are very different.  Smoked Salmon (fresh) in Martha's Vineyard is under 10 dollars a plate.  See alpacas, gingerbread houses, walk the marina, go see the cliffs, tour the lighthouses, eat at the Black dog tavern, ride the oldest working carousel in the states.  Oak Bluffs is a lot of fun, but the other towns are easy to get too.  We went to the chillmark farmer's market, went to the fishing town of Edgartown, get scrimshaw, great artsy museums and stuff<br>  <br>  I would not be interested in the poconos in May, no snow.
cifLm7Nraa	Wait it out for a bit. <br>  <br>  Watch the two of them together, even if that may be a little painful. Do they fight a lot over stupid things or do they get along really well? <br>  <br>  If they seem pretty into each other then you may wanna just get over it but if they seem to be a little rocky, stick around to see what happens haha. <br>  <br>  But then again, no guy wants his best friend to go after his ex|`|Tf19RETiaa	ha bad situation, you should move on =/|`|G4Y96LGqaa	Let it go.

Don't let this girl come between you and your friend. You may think she's an amazing girl but you have to also tell yourself that she is taken.  Try and turn your interest somewhere else talk to other girls get out and meet other girls to get your mind off of her cuz you will definitely end up ruining a friendship.|`|FoJDCb49aa	This is a really bad situation. Hang out with her more, and definately get to know her a little better. You should also talk to your best friend about this because you never want this to go the wrong way.

After this you should be able to make your desicions.|`|EjSjwTfuaa	I think maybe this is a bad idea but tell your friend how you feel so that if they were to break up in the future your friend would know that it is nothing against them if you hook up with the person.|`|gMYoi210aa	wow man i know what it feels like to be thinkin of holdin her in your arms and imagining yourself being with her...its torchure sometimes, so what i do is say: "there are plenty more chicks out there"|`|vkPlX2Y4aa	Get to know her better.

Believe it or not we women care about how you treat your friends. If she thinks you are the kind of person that would totally screw over your best friend to get a girl it makes you look like an ***. If things don't work out with the two of them then maybe there is a chance. Unless you believe in the Bro Code. Then she is off limits no matter what. Maybe she seems so irresistible because she is forbidden fruit. You can look but you can't touch. Just cool down and look elsewhere. Nothing good could come from this.|`|MhHVRveaaa	well ur kinda stuck<br>  see, if your best friend will still b cool with you two dating(which most guys are) after they break up you should just date her but wait a little while(especially if they really loved each other) dont scare her away.<br>  if your best friend wont b cool with it, and you dont want to ruin your friendship, just move on.

dc4883361b4a9ea867331eed902ded8daa	Definitely look at golf clubs and what they have to offer. I hadn't thought about it until my fiancé made it an option, but we're getting married at Valle Vista in Greenwood (a little too far south for you, I think). There were no rental fees for a Sunday morning wedding aside from $400 for the ceremony veranda. The food is tasty and very well priced. They have white linens and napkins for free, no clean up charges, etc.<br>  <br>  Look for areas that want to make a day about you. Careful of hidden fees. Costs for chairs, tables, etc. I found one place that wanted to charge you $200 for cleanup if cake got on the floor if you cut your own cake. Otherwise it was $2 a piece if their caterer cut it for you.<br>  <br>  Try sites like those below to help you find places to research:<br>  (Indy Sites) <a href="http://www.eventective.com/USA/Indiana/Indianapolis/Wedding-Receptions.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eventective.com/USA/Indiana/I...</a><br>  (Noblesville Sites) <a href="http://www.gatheringguide.com/event_directory/rc/in_indiana/noblesville/evl_event_venues.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gatheringguide.com/event_dire...</a><br>  <br>  Also consider having your wedding on an off-time to save on your budget. I'm not talking just out of wedding season(summer - fall), I mean not on a Saturday night. Morning weddings cost less rental and food wise. Friday or Sunday nights also are less heavy on the rental side.|`|c7e6cfa10b802f940e88cd325eb7ce2faa	Try bed and breakfast inns.  There are a couple tea rooms in  Carmel that are nice. If it is summer don't forget about parks.  Think outside the box. There are some farms that have great barns in Noblesville that are very pretty in the summer.  Also you might try kingts of columbus or another veterens hall.  Some private schools rent out they're facilities<br>  and There are club houses that are expansive you may have to do some foot work and calling but it will be worth it.  Good Luck and Congrats!
qc1fasaeaa	It's up to you whether or not you want to plan it together or surprise him. I think you should discuss it with him because he might be planning a surprise for you, and you wouldn't want your plans to clash lol You two could plan a romantic get-away weekend, or you could plan a romantic night at home. You could re-create your first date, or do something that would be special to just the two of you. In my opinion the sweetest thing I think ya'll could do would be to just get away for a night or two. Check into a nice hotel, order in or go to a nice restaurant, see a romantic movie, and then come back to the hotel and let the magic happen! lol Good Luck!|`|w7g4eGqFaa	Well i surprised my x bf for our one year anniversary<br>  i visited him at schoool and i hadf a bigg asssss banner saying " HAPPY ANNIVERSARY BABY" and i had liek bunch of ballooooons and i took him to dinner. after that. thennnn when we were havin dinner he gave me necklace and a promise ring(:|`|MCiSrm2Vaa	congratulations.....if u think u really know his taste, what he might like...give him a surprise gift. plan a trip if possible.  but make sure he is free for it too.  most men like surprise gifts...trust me.  think what he said he wants and give him that, a camera maybe.  its ur first anniver. u will have fun anyway.|`|u0JCNh8zaa	If your husband is not the planning type, then surprise him.<br>  My husband is the planning type and I am the complete opposite.

mywtmSROaa	Due to the fact he was under the influence (though it doesn't excuse it) and he did end up telling you eventually, I wouldn't judge too harshly. Its hard to admit to things of that nature in general so him admitting to it must mean something. I would look at how your relationship is going and if you feel you two truly have a future, don't end it on something like this. But if the lying becomes a habit or if your relationships on the break of destruction then, you might wanna have a "sit me down."|`|3y0w1qIBaa	If he lies again, you should end the relationship.|`|G4Y96LGqaa	If he did it once, he'll do it again.|`|a45ffb40e1ff08eda37fb35f65c6eecaaa	to me kissing a girl is far worse than having sex with her. to rephrase so i make sense, if i had a girlfriend, id be more upset if she kissed a guy rather than if she had sex with him. more often than not you wont find people who are our age and still virgins so it doesnt mean much any more if they have sex. thats just me though|`|uLHtXibRaa	I know exactly how you feel and yes its scary...but..this is part of relationships..with b/f'd g/f's or family members etc..sometimes we have to keep gong until we find a really good sound reason to give up..until then we have to give them the benefit of the doubt...|`|4d52d758f45db34f29370d8ba6d5ec41aa	give him one more chance. if he does it again and move on Erin.|`|Q9sjbSkqaa	chica chill my guy cheated on me 3 times (on accident) lol yea right but u just gotta tell him your morales stright up if he breaks them the n u break u with if if he messes up|`|MxHRjPFHaa	by your responce of okay im glad you told me thats not the way you should have acted you should have been down right *** mad about it...And yes he will lie again just wait till he is drunk again a kiss well maybe but expect the whole k-bang..Get out of the relationship with him hes going to hurt you in the long run|`|YVNBwkCxaa	honestly i say give him anotha chance... and if he lies again break up wit him....  but u cant be lettin him go out to places were he just gonna get drunk and kiss otha gurls... crazy **** happens when u drunk... especially if u take zanex with alchol... so watch out for wut he does|`|Tb5OoHrQaa	forgiveness <br>  <br>  you might as well learn it now cuz your going to have to eventually, especially when it comes to guys<br>  <br>  give him one more chance and then cut the cord|`|ihe7xV6Raa	if he told u then he didn't lie to u but he was probably ashamed about it so he rathere u don't know then telling u and u getting mad at him|`|kmV5MnvPaa	Tell him strait up.

Just let him feel comfortable to talk to u about it.|`|gu5fBjrdaa	definitely forgive him but if he continues to do this sort of thing the lying and such, then i think it would be best to end it. trust me honesty is KEY in a relationship.|`|BIweLR4raa	if u truly love him and he to u then give him another chance (he is human after all) but if u doubt that he loves u then u should think serusly bout ending it|`|3nL4BgCjaa	He cheated on you.

Dump him. There are too many nice guys in the world to settle for the rotten few. I met a lovely guy and we arranged a date in advance the early afternoon; he then kept calling to delay, kept me waiting all day saying he was busy and then at 5pm said he couldnt make it and could we rearrange? I dumped him right there and then, no time for games. You should never ever put up with anything less. If you let his behaviour slide, it sends out the message that you will tolerate second class behaviour and are not worth better. Do yourself a favour, dump his sorry butt and put yourself on a pedestal - noone else will do it for you and once you are up there, the REAL men will realise your worth. There's nothing more attractive than a worthy lady! ;)|`|EJ6Ug6Etaa	A guy I was seeing also kissed a girl when he was drunk one night. We had been apart over the summer vacation and I jokingly asked him one day had he been good. I knew instantly by the look on his face that something wasnt quite right, and he told me that he had kissed someone when out one night. I quizzed him further, but I believed that he was telling me the truth so we left it at that. We dated for 2 more years after that! So my response would be, that if you love the guy and you are sure that he loves you, you will move on from it. You may not want to kiss, hug or even see him for a few days, but just allow yourself some space to clear your head. Once you have forgiven him, you will both be so much stronger for it. I'm not saying that you will "forget" but if you are strong enough, you can "forgive".|`|tG3iVkMeaa	This happened to me only I was the guy and my girlfriend did it. I wouldn't stick around, I know it's a hard thing to say and a hard thing to do but she broke up with me and blamed it on me then told me she cheated on me. And no matter if she wanted to tell me or not she did. I would have found out otherwise but don't waste your time. Yes you like him and he apologized but no he's not worth it. A true man would have asked you to go or if you cared if he went then had the thought of you in the front of his head and not done it. I know people make mistakes but this is not worth it.
z0ro3VkJaa	My mother is the exact same position as you are, and has been for about 20 years now. She has never liked her sister in law, and her sister in law has never liked her. But she loves my father, and keeps a civil tongue with his sister. And when my aunt says something disrespectful to or about my mother, you can better believe he tells her where she can stick those negative comments. <br>  <br>  My mother doesn't tell my father not to talk to his sister, that is a completely ridiculous request. All she asks is that he have enough respect for her to not let his sister carry on like a fool when it involves her.<br>  <br>  My mother told me a story once, of how after my father had proposed to her that his sister called him (while they were together) to tell him he was an idiot for wanting to marry her. I believe the exact quote my mother used was that he said to her "That's none of our ******* business" and hung up.<br>  <br>  But she is still his sister. And the woman you are talking about is still your husband's sister. She has always been a part of his family, and likely always will be. And I think you need to accept that. You don't have to like her, and you most certainly do not have to respect her, but you need to be civil towards her. It cannot feel good for your husband when you tear away at his sister.<br>  <br>  Do you have any siblings? How would it feel for you if he was asking you to tear them out of your life?|`|reAtqf0Maa	she's pro ably upset and lonely. remember bullies bully people because they have had a hard time or are lonely. now the bully thing is the same with your family. ok you may hate this but invite her in your house and make her feel welcome be kind no matter what and find out why her heart it like this. help her until she can find the good! then once you help her find the good things should look up!|`|d1TTwwUUaa	The same has happened in my family. It just takes a light bulb to go on in hubbies head before he actually realizes enough is enough. Just stay away from SIL and have NO conversations with him about her. It's hard I know but he needs to realize enough is enough all on his own, otherwise she's going to win if you let her come between hubby and yourself DON"T LET HER    good luck|`|TPhIWWniaa	I've been married to my husband for 6 years and his two sisters sound just like your SIL, but I must admit the more I got to know my SILs I realized they just LOVED drama.<br>  They treated my husband & I like great old buddies at the family gatherings but once we left they would say all sorts of nasty stuff about my husband & I; my husband & I discussed this a few times (when he brought up the subject) and came to the conclusion that they just loved drama & they were also jealous of our accomplishments.<br>  It wasn't until this past Thanksgiving that my husband had enough of them and has now cut all ties with them.<br>  <br>  All I can say is give it time and let your husband come to whatever decision on his own because you don't want him resenting you for taking him away from his "family" no matter how nuts they are.

Why don't you try one out and see how it goes?<br>  <br>  And by the way, it doesn't make a difference if you're straight, gay , or bi so don't stress it.<br>  <br>  PS- Many women find other women attractive because the female body is typically viewed as more beautiful.  It doesn't mean you have sexual desires.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	you have to experience it to know.  it might just be a curiosity that you're having.  you might not like it after all.|`|bjgs0szFaa	You'll have to try and see which one suits you better to know.|`|78VOJFB3aa	if you're young, say 10-12 or whatever, Ive heard it's normal for some girls to go through that stage. Its just a phase though, lol. I think what it is is that when girls reach pubirty, some tend to be jealous of other female's having bigger 'parts,' and fantisize about it. But, if you're NOT 10-12, or around that age grouping area, maybe you are gay. IDK, im no expert.|`|BYWDIhuLaa	I read in cosmo that it is normal for a girl to be attracted to another woman becasue you would like a little mix up in your relationship i would say that you should wait then see what ur body tells you or your heart!!!
GOSMZMpwaa	MENOPAUSE!!! lol <br>  <br>  Same with my mom. Try to avoid her. Not talk to her unless totally necessary until she stops PMSing. When she irritates you until you want to kill her, press your fingers together and count. <br>  <br>  Good Luck! :)|`|rRfUtK8Kaa	Write a really angry letter, just write down whatever u want to say, then throw it away? :L|`|reAtqf0Maa	you tell her about this! tell her you just need some space! ask what's happening so she can be kind again|`|PyRxe9B2aa	Does your mon have a health problem or maybe drugs or alcohol or even change of life? It sounds like one of these. Maybe when all is ok you could tell her that she has changed. Maybe she is unhappy in love. If you knew what was wrong maybe you could make her feel better. I really don't think you hate her I think you hate the way she is acting towards you.  Please show her your question and all the answers that you get. Maybe seeing these she will realize how her problem is affecting you. I am sure she loves you and I think you love her too. Best of luck|`|RDz4LmHDaa	lord...calm down.your mom is a human being just like you and she has those days too you know.<br>  <br>  have you atleese try and talk to her and asked how she felt.<br>  you sound a bit selfish :P<br>  <br>  now instead of calling your mom a b(tch go and ask her whats wrong!|`|YTasscmKaa	Shes not going through menopause is she, Jillibean?

When people are stressed, they tend to be on edge.  Be there for her, ask her if she needs to talk, i know she doesnt mean to take it out on you especially if she hasnt always been like this then something is DEFF. on her mind.  But dont be such a rude little brat, its your mother, she gave you life and everything else you have and need.  You dont hate her, remember you said that when she isnt around anymore.  Have some more respect little one|`|Ova4dilbaa	maybe shes PMSing... just guessing<br>  but y dont u try just behaving very very very very very well [just around her] and when u see that shes in a bad mood, steer clear.

kfWi9ZkEaa	I've got two theories:<br>  <br>  theory one:  he made her feel 'alive'.  She became addicted to the emotional ups and downs.  As such, someone should ask her if this is how she feels, because being alerted to it is half the cure for it, given that when you realise you're doing it you realise it's stupid.<br>  <br>  Theory 2:  she invested so much in him, made such a huge investment and so many compromises and sacrifices, that the idea that he wasn't worth it is too big to take in, so she's in denial a bit.   She's paid a HUGE price to be with him so she's having difficulty with the idea that he wasn't worth the money - do you see?  She is trying to believe he was worth the money because otherwise she's an incredible idiot.<br>  <br>  Final comment:  it's really hard to learn that you can love someone with all your heart, who is bad for you.  I imagine she loved him quite badly as well as the above:  which is to say she 'pair-bonded' and identifies with him.  What she actually needs is time.  They say it takes 1/2 the time you ahd the relationship, to get over the relationship.  I wouldn't expect it to take 7 years but you know, it could.  Give her time.  She's horribly wounded, still bleeding, still in terrible pain.  No wonder she can't look at this other guy and if she had a relationship with him now it would be all over in a fortnight: she's simply not ready.  Let her lick her wounds, give her a big hug and tell her she did the right thing.  poor dear.|`|PyRxe9B2aa	Your mom is addicted to him. He is like a drug.  She knows that  he is no good for her but she can't stop trying.  She is  a little ? on the mental side about this. You can do nothing only time will change things. Be your own healthy self and stop trying to change her. Only she can do that and if she is not good at it then time is the only cure.|`|GOSMZMpwaa	Tell her all the bad things about the old boyfriend. Tell her all the good things about the new boyfriend. Point out every bad thing about the old one. Point every GOOD thing out about the new one. Soon she will come to her senses. She is just heartbroken.|`|ml2FDYECaa	This characteristic that your mom has stems from her childhood. A role model that she looked up to. Could even remind herself of a family member...dad even. If she was a product of abuse as a child then most likely she will cling onto someone like that. Good men are better, but some people don't see that greatness from the inside. Love is strong...strange sometimes, but strong. I know of someone who is in the same situation, and it sucks to see the destruction right in front of you. Especially when it is happening to someone you love...GL|`|j7Oplmzqaa	maybe she had true feeling 4 him...but if he wuz that bad, i wld have kicked his a** 2 the curb a LONG  time ago.but every1s different and maybe she just needs help realizing that hes no good for her.|`|1yk7HEeWaa	because when people treat you like **** you become attatched. . <br>  its all psycological and cant be helped!<br>  she should see someone about it!<br>  <br>  xxsaraxx
VSVQHKwKaa	Yep.<br>  <br>  But I'd make sure not to get caught....even if that meant I had to wait and pick my moment.<br>  <br>  But yes, justice is not found in our courts today.

I needed support, not to worry about the result of my husband committing a crime. It's really a selfish act to indulge your rage.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	No I wouldn't kill the person that did this to my wife. That doesn't mean I would want to, but if you think about it...your spouse just went through the most traumatic experience I believe a person ever could, and you, instead of keeping a cool head to be there for your spouse during this time, succumb to your anger and now you and the rapist will be in prison.<br>  <br>  How are you going to help your spouse through this and protect them from behind bars? Where is the justice for the spouse in that?<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I love a lot of people enough to kill some one in their defense.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	I certainly would want to...totally...but that's why most countries have a justice system that is kept out of the hands of the victims.|`|SS1FFafRaa	yes.  dead.|`|2keIEMFUaa	WOW! I think any one who loves any one would feel that way, but I don't think I could kill someone, I look at this way if they don't get punish for it in our court system, then I sure hate to be in there shoes when they meet our Creator.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Damn right I would.

Of course I would gut him like a pig.
OCMSTxYfaa	Yes, just let it go.  It is obvious he is very self centered and critical, which of course you know, means, very unhappy with himself.  You have to ask yourself, are you better off with him in your life or without him?  Do you enjoy visits? (doesn't sound like it is too much fun) and do you really need his approval?  Trust me, you don't.  I know it is a parent's job to nurture and pat their children on the back, but not all parents have that ability.  You are obviously doing well on your own, and must learn to just accept the fact that he isn't in it for the love, but to do nothing other than analyze your life as being nothing more to him than that...a life. so if you can handle nothing more than criticism and a lifetime of disappointment, and able to accept that..fine. If not, let it go.  Too bad, he really doesn't know what he is missing.|`|hvwp2bcVaa	I am sorry your family is a screwed up as mine<br>  <br>  My advice..STOP<br>  <br>  I know he is your dad, but you are old enough to let him go. Some people thrive on the drama they cause people, don't let him do that to you.<br>  <br>  He also may seem to favor your sister because she is the only one who "needs" him...<br>  <br>  Really. you have to just go on. If he calls be the good person you are and talk with him but don't let him back in so tight...make it about you, not him<br>  <br>  If you don't , you'll be chasing his approval all your life and you will never be happy. Be happy for yourself|`|XkidpdPWaa	Your Dad is a knob. You've done all you can.

You are a very strong, independent woman. Sounds like they are jealous because of your success. I would not give them the time of day to bother me. They seem to be bringing you down.  Don't let them bring you down. You got where you are because of you not because someone else felt sorry for you or you had to go suck up to daddy. That is well worth being proud of yourself. Just know that there is a woman out there who admires your strength and success.|`|fHA6zk07aa	That is a tough one.Reach out and say your sorry if that is what you think is true,however if he can't forgive nothing you can do but move on is all and make life good for yourself.|`|CUq935Xgaa	You call him and say what the heck why do u do all this freakin things for my sister.

Ig9EXjhUaa	Here is the reality of the situation:  Men are usually guided by their libido, and women tend to be led by their emotions. That isn’t to say that he doesn’t like you as a friend, but a guy does NOT have to love, or even really like, a girl to have sex with her. Women, on the other hand, tend to bond with the people we are physically involved with. Our bodies actually release chemicals that make this happen. It can even make we think we care more about someone than we really do. Men don’t have that same strong response. <br>  <br>  My advice, if you value your heart and your friendship, is to end the physical aspect of your friendship before things go too far and you give into temptation or pressure. Are you prepared to have that kind of no commitment relationship? Have you considered how you might feel if he decides that he doesn’t ever call you again after you’ve done it? What if he finds a girl he really does want to date after you’ve given in? It sucks to even consider those kinds of things, but unfortunately they do happen.<br>  <br>  I know that it’s tempting to believe that if you just wait long enough that he’ll come around and feel the way about you that you do about him, but the reality is that it’s not very likely. In fact, many guys like that often lose interest after they’ve gotten what they want and the challenge is gone. If he really cared about you, even as a friend, he wouldn’t even be suggesting a “friends with benefits” type relationship in the first place.<br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor… Cut this guy loose; know that you are worth more than that, and there are many other guys out there that will be able to recognize a gem when they see one.|`|igI5yX0vaa	End it now.  There are others out there with whom you could have a real relationship.|`|Draugm5qaa	he's using you, find a guy who is committed to you.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|w8OOs3n9aa	end it.  as a girl, i don't like the whole friends with benefits concept.  if you really like him then there should be a more solid relationship between you two.  if he likes you then he would want you to be his girlfriend, not the whole friend with benefits thing.  he's probably just using you for you know what so it's better to end it now.|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Well that's something that you have to really think about...are you willing to just be basically his booty call? If you give a guy sex with no commitment that's just too easy for him.  If you want any kind of respect I wouldn't give into him cuz you're not going to get it that way.  If you don't care and just want the benefit of having sex then go ahead.|`|j7o7RsZKaa	become bf and gf and if he says no end it then he is using u<br>  <br>  mine plz: <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmBFC9EU3TjRGjcjLxKn8hfD7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090223124204AArXDf6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AA11006063	Don't make out!|`|7wA2zYHPaa	Look at my problem <><a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AusTCk4k.jvOxj8cjTRCbS7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223161022AAIzhO4>" rel="nofollow">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> and you will see that friends with benefits just leads to a messy situation.... and it sucks! Because, as the first response said, after you give in and the challenge is gone, they get bored and move on to another girl. <br>  <br>  I knew when I got into my current situation this guy was not a relationship kind of guy, so I figured friends with benefits was enough for me. It's not. Half the fun in the relationship is actually loving and caring for the person you're with, and vice versa! The other stuff is nice too, but [for me]  when it's all physical I feel empty afterward and I feel a drop in my self worth. If you like this guy, a friends with benefits relationship is only going to get you hurt. If you would like it to go past that, tell him! Say that you are not interested in "friends with benefits", but you like him and wouldn't mind being something more.|`|mywtmSROaa	Coming from someone who has been in that situation on a few different occasions, you either need to become more then friends or go back to being just friends. Staying in that middle place will eventually get tiresome and someone's gonna end up getting hurt.|`|sZ53glP4aa	you need to ask what you want from it, if you want a casual relationship then go for it as long as you think you can seperate yourself from sex and falling in love with someone. sounds like he could be just using you, make him wait.|`|cOBsDBgqaa	if you want to be FRIENDS then i would end it.<br>  if you want to be FRIENDS with BENIFITS then i would keep it going but tell him that you dont want to do anything other than kiss and make out only cause you arent ready...|`|SR1FN2nqaa	if i were you and your not ready to have sex and he tries to keep pushing it on you then thats all he really wants....sorry. but you need to tell him its not gonna happen and if he changes then theres your answer......forget him.|`|MxHRjPFHaa	has he ever told you he likes you and does he ever mess around with other females...I think this can work but if you do start dating him expect to go farther then just making out because thats what he;ll think|`|GtNUIvQtaa	nothing wrong with benefits...unless you have a boyfriend|`|uFmrZbCbaa	honestly, if you don't leave him now he will leave you when he gets what he wants.|`|0g9NY2BVaa	Don't do it!  If he can't accept "NO, I'm not ready now", then ditch him.  You should never, ever feel a need to give into any just to their "friend".  Which isn't really what being friends is all about.<br>  <br>  LOSE HIM NOW.
n84CnN9eaa	dont worry bout your parents, but the other note, you girls need to stop thinking only bout yourselves. he would get hurt more if you just brushed him off, and if u 2 like each other then you should get back together, and it takes 2 to tango, so whatever you 2 keep breaking up from, is your fault 2. give him another chance. tell him he has to try not to do watever, and you make damn sure that you try your a** off or else theres no point of you 2 getting back together.|`|9p70ijUgaa	Ok, if you guys are on and off, then it will always be that way.

You don't have to be perfect... but this is pretty bad.<br>  <br>  If you two keep breaking up for the same reasons, then maybe you aren't supposed to be together.  Communication is key, and if you can't figure out how to talk about your problems and resolve them, then you probably aren't communicating well.  Or it could be that there's no way to resolve the problems... which is why you keep breaking up over them!<br>  <br>  You may love someone and they may love you, but that doesn't mean you're meant to be together.  It takes a lot more than love to make a relationship work.  It takes trust, honesty, integrity, commitment (which it doesn't sound like one/either of you have if you keep breaking up and getting back together), hard work, compromise, willingness to talk through the difficult things without blowing up at each other... acceptance of one another's harmless faults, etc.  It's easy to start a relationship, but not always so easy to keep it going and keep it healthy!<br>  <br>  If your parents threaten to beat him up, I'm going to assume you are under 18 and still living in their house.  That means that this is a young relationship and you both probably still have a lot of growing up to do, which is normal.  Just enjoy your life now and don't worry too much about adolescent relationships.  Of course they can be meaningful, but it isn't the end of the world if they don't work out.  In the meantime, take your parents' opinions into consideration.  If you keep breaking up with this guy, and your parents don't like him, they're probably seeing things that you don't want to see in him - like that he's not good for you.  That doesn't mean they should beat him up, but it does mean that you should really think about taking their advice and NOT get back together with this guy.|`|145911b5154c5d91455135bf422cd573aa	Ooh, touchy. But, I am dealing with a similar situation.<br>  <br>  The first thing to do is ask your parents why they do not like him. Do not encourage certain answers, such as habits, looks, family history, etc., but inside ask them and make sure you understand their answers. If they do not like his looks, ask him to change how he looks so they might accept him. If they do not like his habits, ask him to change his habits into habits more acceptable to your parents. If it is hi family history, there is not much you can do to change that, but let your parents know as much as possible about the choices his family made and why.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, threats of violence is assault, which is a crime. If they follow through on their threats, they are committing battery. If you tell them that threats and beating people up are crimes and show them where you got that information, they should realize that what they are doing can be considered criminal and stop.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps|`|kVTbEb1Paa	Tell him its over? I mean from where i see it is that you have broken up more than once, and are tired of him?

My mom hated one of my boyfriends when I was in high school, but he said he loved me, and I thought I loved him too. Anyway, I found out that he was dealing drugs. I caught him cheating on me with one of my closest friends, so I broke up with him. A month later, he dropped out of school. Today, he has 3 kids by 3 different girls, has been in jail twice, and is 24 and still living with his parents. Sounds like a real winner, right? Oh, and, btw, your parents won't hate everyone.

I think that you should break up with your current boyfriend because you are hurting him. And if you don't know what you want then you should take a break from both of the guys to give yourself some time to think. If your current boyfriend moves on then that's ok you don't have much to worry about anymore with him. I think if you are planning on getting back with your ex you should try some kind of counseling. Breaking up off and on is not healthy for a relationship and is immature and is one reason why I say your not ready for a relationship. You have to work on your differences and issues before you are able to have a good relationship. Good Luck|`|ygimTNzoaa	Never stay in a relationship when you're cheating on your mate, that's just wrong. You need to break up with him obviously, but that's totally your decision. The fact that you had many "break ups" means you cannot handle a bad situation with that man, you need someone who you can work your issues out without breaking up, that is not a real relationship, you don't hear of married people having "break ups". They work things out together, if you cant, you're not meant to be together. I've held on to a 5 year live in relationship with no "break ups". And I'm in my new live in relationship since September 16th 2008 and we've never had "break ups". I don't understand it, how can you expect to be respected and taken seriously if you and your mate cannot work out your issues? I hope you grow out if it, good luck. And for the sake of your current guy, don't drag him along in the dark, you need to break up and stay broken up for heaven sake.

g6dOrpZHaa	Tell her exactly how you feel. Let her know she's close to losing you and her happy little family life with all of you together. I'm a woman, and I know its very important to stay attractive, and stay fun, and let the kids know that I still have a life as I guide theirs. She needs to know that you married her for the great relationship you had with her and who she has become is hurtful and selfish to neglect your needs & wants with her. She may be betty crocker and a great mom but she needs to really wake up. I think its false advertisment for women to let themselves and their care for their relationships go after they get married. Its unfair to you and I see why you are depressed, no one wants to divorce but no one wants to live in an unhappy union either. So tell her how you feel, put your foot down about it, and give it your best shot to make it work. And if it doesn't, its not your fault you tried and you will be happy again. You and all your kids will be fine. Don't let it wear you out.|`|IvMPh09baa	well... you are answering your own question here.  you know what you have to do, you are unfulfilled in your marriage.  and your needs/wants are no longer being satisfied by your partner, if you feel you have truly put forth all effort to make things work yet its not being reciprocated or fulfilled then i am afraid the only solution is to move on with your life.<br>  <br>  love and marriage is a risk, we can put all the trust and effort into our marriage and our partner but if its not given in return then one must move forward.  the longer you stay in a miserable marriage the mroe you are wasting your life away.  your kids dont' deserve an unhappy parent, and your not doing your children any favors by showing them that its ok to stay in an unhappy and unfulfilled marriage.  if not for yourself now, i suggest you do it for your children... be a role model at least for them and show them that happiness is attainable but one must be active at attaining it.<br>  <br>  have you tried counseling?|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	Great, isn't it that once a wife becomes a mother and her priotities are less about sex and more about parenting you are distancing yourself.<br>  I imagine your wife would welcome some support in the upbringing of your family.

If you aren't getting through to her on your own - you need someone else to help you out.  Call on a professional - get some counseling.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	You have very valid concerns and worries but I think it is still possible to bring this marriage back to where it should be. It is normal for a woman to shift focus from husband to children when they become mothers but it still leaves the husband holding the bag. Tell her (no long talks this time) that the two of you will be going to counseling. That you want your wife back and your friend back and that you are going to move heaven and earth to make that happen. Make the appointment before tellling her.<br>  <br>  Also, set up a "date night". Make arrangements for grandparents, an aunt or a good babysitter to watch the children one night a week. Then take her out to a simple dinner, a movie, a coffee shop, an art gallery. Whatever you like but NOT drinking. This will give you both a chance to reaquaint with each other. You need to become a couple again as a supplement to being "mom and dad'. <br>  <br>  Remember, what you had once you can have again. But anything worth having is worth working for.|`|naequcqlaa	I just cannot understand how a wife can suddenly "cut it off" w/someone who once was the center of their world, but cannot still be the same even tho there are now children involved.  There should be NO reason whatsoever for her to neglect you & all that she once had w/you.  Just because you have children, does NOT take away any desires to be the same loving wife you once were.  It's like she's almost pushing you away & into someone else's arms for the needs you have & she's just plain ignoring them.  Does she realize what she's putting you thu?  How much she's actually hurting you & your marriage to her?  Have you told her just how bad it is & how you've stated it in your post?  Would she by any chance be willing to go for counseling w/you?  I KNOW if she would, the counselor surely would bring up to her just what she's doing to your marriage by her total neglect of you. TELL her if your honest tho'ts & that you're thinking of leaving this neglected marriage that you now are in.  If I knew my husband was suffering as you are, I sure would straighten myself up & take care of the one person who "gave" me the children that are causing her to neglect you.  W/o you, she wouldn't even have these children she's doting on completely.  She needs to be reminded of that too.  You are the sole reason she has these children who now have taken priority over you!  You are a prime person who would be subjected to looking for love in different places.  Would that have any meaning to her?!  She has to understand her priorities are all wrong.  No one could fault you for not accepting the unacceptable.  I would tell her you're to that point where you are not about to accept the unacceptable, & what is she going to do about it.  Does she even care that she just may end up rasing these children on her own?  What is she going to do when they get older, & are not around all the time as they are now.  She's going to be a very lonely person to say the least.  Our children are "gifts", we do not "relplace" them for the husband who gave us so much love & the same love that once bro't us together.  I certainly do wish you all the best, & hopefully you can have one more serious talk to her & tell her EVERYTHING & even maybe suggest getting help by a counselor who I feel would be of help to you.  ALL best wishes to you...:)|`|2qqQFgLDaa	1 talk to your wife about it. Maybe she doesn't realize how bad she has let it get. <br>  #2<br>  Go to therapy and talk to someone~ It will help you so much.

She is going thru something that she feel she can no longer be intimate with you.  Depression could be something causing her disinterest.  You have to talk to her openly and honestly, be somewhat stern in insisting you both get help, or you will have to make other choices.  You will have to be brutally honest, but try that before throwing in the towel.  She should jump at the chance, as maybe she is truly hurting inside.

You need to sit down with her a lone and tell her just how you feel, because it's just eating you up inside and you can't keep living like this and you don't want to get divorce.  I think you need to send her some flowers and a card and inside the card you write that your asking her out on a date, go to dinner, do the wine thing and romance her do the thing you did with her in the beginning, you need to take her out, and you need to make her feel the way you use too.  I hope this helps. Remember thoughts day and relive but for today...|`|O8RuSBAjaa	It is not uncommon for couples to get so involved raising children that they lose themselves and each other in the process. Find a good couples counselor that you both like, and work on getting to know each other again before you make a final decision that your relationship no longer is worth saving. <br>  <br>  Also, make an effort to spend some time together without the children, even if it feels forced at first. Perhaps you'll discover that person you remember from your "honeymoon" is still there somewhere behind the "mom".|`|afI03mJXaa	I believe that you still have hope whether it is little or big. Marriages are tough and I'm sure you know that. When people have kids the marriage becomes even more difficult for the very reason your talking about. Most new moms become really attached to their children and forget that there is a world around them that they can be involved in. I don't think she is not attracted to you or interested in you anymore I think she just needs to be told that there are other things in life that she needs to be involved in besides your children. It is good that you see the problem and that you are concerned. I think you need to tell her that you are planning on going to a counselor about the marriage because you believe there are issues. Let her know that you would like her to attend with you because it means a lot to you and ya'lls marriage. I believe that you do feel for her still you are just to caught up in the situation to see that. Sometimes when we panic and think hard on a situation we forget our emotions and become numb. Find a way to get it through to her that whats going on is a big deal and that you want her to be there and support you through this and try to work at the marriage instead of giving up. We all have our down points sometimes we just need our spouses to be there when we are down so they can help us back up. Fight for your marriage. Good Luck|`|FQxbwbtlaa	she's feelin a bit awcward and put out spend time together|`|NE1cgh3Vaa	Go to counseling if need be. Never be ashamed to try to work things out with your wife. It shows you love her very much!! Try and see if there are any things you can help with around the house so she can feel relieved. Maybe she's stressed from all of the tasks she has in a days period and when it's time to rest, she tries but she might have too many things on her mind regarding responsibilities? Get a babysitter and take her out on a date! Go to a nice hotel even if its for a short stay and pamper her the best way you know how. I think she's just overwhelmed. It happens but it's not the end of life. Try to rekindle and always let her know you are there to help. I've been there, it helps to know your man cares and understands. Good luck, hope I've helped.

If what she says sounds unreasonable, try to come to a compromise with her about how late you can stay up and what happens if you are too tired to get ready for school. Teenagers can have lots of trouble sleeping, and electronics are sometimes the problem, but it can be many other things. If this is the first time you've had that problem, it's probably not a big deal. But if it is every day or every week, you have an issue.<br>  <br>  She may have overreacted, but if you have an adult conversation with her you will earn a lot of respect and she may cut you some more slack next time.

Why mess up a friendship and be so selfish to only think of herself. She should know that you like him 2 and that a friend shouldn't do that. Why is she asking, she shouldn't ask but to take matter into her own hands and think, damn this is my friends i am hurting and for what, a BOY. There are a lot of fishes in the sea, much more sexier, nicer, and etc. What you should do and this is all up to you if to make friends with people who actually care and tell her the truth that is isn't ok because it hurts you. Be honest it shouldn't kill no one to be honest to one another. If she doesn't listen then she isn't mature and doesn't care for you. If that happen just live your life and like i said before look for a real friend, move on and more fishes. Tell her that you don't want to be mean to her, or have any problems with her but to make her understand what she is doing.

What she did, getting w/ him even though she knew you liked him is pretty shady but you also have to take in consideration, is she really that bad of a person? My friend wasn't and I'm sure her intention wasn't to hurt me. My dream guy wasn't into me he was into her and she liked him back, she couldn't help that I mean how do you tell yourself to stop liking someone? It's just a cruel truth I had to accept. In the end my so called dream guy wasn't all I made him up to be, he turned out to be a real BIG asshole and did some really messed up things to her. I just feel like she did me a huge favor instead. But however you choose to see it make sure you tell her how you really do feel about what she did to you. Stop telling her it is ok she's dating him when you're really not ok w/ it... I mean she's asking you so be honest about it even though she should have common sense but if she really didn't care about you she wouldn't bother asking you, that's just my opinion. Just realize that some things aren't meant to be.  Would you rather be w/ a boy that secretly likes your friend or someone that is ONLY into you? Best of luck :)|`|XCPctxGHaa	no she isn't a REAL friend, nor is she  A FRIEND. & well i guess he isn't your dream man & it just isn't meant to be & yeah of course you're going to say it's okay because you don't want to look obsessive over a boy who you believe is your "dream man" but he likes your best friend, now would you?|`|n30Q5rtIaa	okay so same thing happened to me!<br>  okay so what you do is be like <br>  "when you started going out with him, i was pretty mad. (idk if u still r lol). times went on a little more and i feel like shiz because u knew that i liked him but yet u went out with him. u can go out with him just dont expect me to be happy about it, or for u."<br>  thats pretty much what i did.<br>  hope it helps hun.<br>  <3|`|DxYKxamyaa	Shes not that great of a friend If she cant see it in your eyes. If you really like this guy,talk to him. I don't think he would want to go out with a girl when their is someone like you that you really like or in another case...love.
3TobPBDOaa	I had an extremely similar experience when i was in school.<br>  <br>   He was my French teacher and i was completely and utterly in awe of him. To me, he was as perfect as you can get. He made me feel wonderful when i was around him. I wrote very deep poems detailing my heartache knowing i could never be with him. And the more i watched him, like you, the more i was convinced he liked me too. Even too this day, him behavior seemed strange when he was around me, but perhaps they are false memories. Perhaps he could recognise my feelings for him, and i was mistaking his actions for flattery and caution. It took me nearly two years to completely get over him. I would cry for hours after i left school, missing him so much. <br>  <br>  I'm 18 now, was 15 then. I went back to see him (and some of the other teachers) a few months ago. He wasn't what i remembered. Well... he was still sweet. But he had lost his perfection. He seemed a lot... smaller, and very much equal to myself. And i realised that I had no attraction to him anymore. But I didn't mind. <br>  <br>  I now like someone else. But it isn't the same at all. From what I have now, i realised that i never really know my french teacher, so how could i really love him. It was an infatuation, a hidden lust and a rush of hormones. Yes it was extremely strong, and meant a lot at the time. But it's just a part of life.<br>  <br>  As for telling him. You could. I want to as well, but never did. The fact that he has a family might make things a bit more awkward. Just tred carefully. teaching is an extremely delicate profession that can be destroyed very easily but mere rumor or accusation. You may find that he is somewhat more cautious around you if you do, he wouldn't want to give you any accidental signals. Just remember. The likelihood that he is going to A. Ruin his career for a pupil of his and/or B. Leave him family for a pupil of his are EXTREMELY low. If you do tell him, don't expect him to change for the better and start making moves on you.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	you should find a good opportunity to let him how your feelings and how long you been having this feelings.  worst come to worst you know that you are honest about your feelings.  and that will make you feel much better later on.|`|dV6nEBUdaa	let him know how you feel<br>  even if he doesn't the same way about you <br>  it will help you if he did know :)|`|T32hOtKtaa	tell em tell em! or leave  and anyonomous letter....or u culd always tell him at graduation! ^^ hopez i culd helpz!|`|UlgvwAjjaa	I'm assuming that you are underage and in high school, since you didn't say.  In that case....<br>  <br>  I wouldn't tell him.  I am speaking from personal experience, because I had it bad for my Latin teacher for two years.  Normally, I am all for "tell the person that you love" but in this case, it could strain the teacher/student relationship (in terms of grades or such), if you are friends more than just the average teacher/student, it could also harm that dynamic, it could potentially harm a marriage (if you started something) and it could get both of you in trouble with the law (again, if you started something).  In my case, I didn't want to take these risks and screw things up.  I eventually found a man that I've been with for three years now.  <br>  <br>  However, there comes a day when you leave high school :-)  Tell him on graduation night.|`|UAMtRFruaa	Just tell him. You never know. Maybe he feels the same.|`|fNctrQ4Haa	I have the same problem. I think my teacher likes me too. He stared at me when I was with my science teacher.Although,I'm not in love him that much but he is muscular. Tell him. (haha well I gotta do the same thing lol)

HL8PEDFLaa	Stop asking for tips on how to perpetuate American's downfall by sneaking these illegals across the border|`|Zcx9JOGXaa	try the immigration posting section you might get better answers there|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	i dont know anyone who has been deported to cuba but a guy i work with had his wife deported t omexico, because he was talking baout how he got her over hrere illegally and someoen in our office ratted them out.
udcDpXfeaa	Just be honest with her. Forget about being mean or hurting her feelings. Truth be told, she hurt you when she ignored your calls and texts. Let her know how unfair it was that she had cut off all contact with all her friends, even you, and now you feel like she is just trying to be your friend when it's convenient for her. Let her know how hurt or mad or ticked (whatever the case is) that you feel, especially now after three months has passed that she decides she wants to get back in touch (Why, because she breaks up with this guy, perhaps?)<br>  Tell her that you refuse to be a "convenience friend," and if she really wants to be your friend she would. If she basically tells you off, she's probably not who you'd want to continue to be friends with.|`|7ouqu8f4aa	Just tell her. <br>  <br>  Look we were good friends, but you put that on hold for a boyfriend. I'll only start talking to you again if you can promise you won't do that to me again, otherwise I don't want to continue to feel like a rebound.|`|FHcCNiC1aa	OMG im in the same ship right now.<br>  <br>  i like all of the answers above --^|`|mMLZfxeCaa	Okay, friends will do that first of all. It sucks and it hurts..believe me, I've been there.<br>  <br>  But, text her back, be the mature one. And just kinda catch up.<br>  As for talking to her, my advice is talk to her face-to-face. Thats ALWAYS best. This way, you can show her how you feel and if your less likely to mix up your words.<br>  <br>  When you talk to her, just tell her pretty much everything how you feel. Of course, give her her chance to talk and listen to her. Remain calm etc.. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped. And good luck!|`|qsETZIEIaa	well if you want to be nice you can ask her why she has not talked to you<br>  if you want to be mean you can say nothing i wanna tell you or not like you would care<br>  <br>  remember: the girl might be having an issue she wants to talk to you about so keep that in mind|`|k2bNhHhsaa	say umm you know i sent you a text like 3 months ago and you never texted back i dont mean to sound mean but it kinda or really hurt my feelings  <br>  hope i helped<br>  ?xo?Jenna?xo?|`|xESfrW1Qaa	u should tell her "how come u spend hardly anytime with ur friends?" or ask her why she ignores u.....................
9XzqquAKaa	I don't remember even hearing one song! :) It's so hectic and goes by so fast that you don't really pay attention. It was just good background noise :)|`|bf6K6uubaa	i have never met anyone who forgot their music..they might have had a very informal wedding or not chosen the music themselves which is why it had no meaning hence them not remembering|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Yes because my in laws hired a Greek band to play at our wedding.  They played some traditional American songs but then they got heavy into the Greek stuff - people were dancing in circles for hours.  Oh well.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I didn't hear the music, I was too focused on the process. I asked the band to play the song again, after the ceremony was over and we were just having a good time.
ZvWM9v0kaa	Same exact problem with me, except for the having sex part. <br>  <br>  My parents will not let my boyfriend and I go upstairs, we need to stay downstairs at all times. I used to not be able to go to his house either. What I had to do was have my boyfriend over a few times, like for dinner or to watch a movie so he could get to know my parents. Once my parents got to know him, and talked with his mom they let me go over to his house. There, we are allowed in his room and we actually have time to talk and hang out without people listening in on us. <br>  <br>  I know it may be a little embarrassing to explain to him, but it's what needs to be done and TRUST ME, it will pay off. <br>  <br>  About the having sex thing, I would wait until you are older. I know, you are probably getting that a lot but to me, sex is the extreme. I mean it seems that you guys haven't really done anything intimately before since you are not allowed at his house. Work up to it. Make sure that you are really comfortable with this guy and want to share that with him. There are other things to do (that i am not going to get into) besides sex that are just as pleasing and are a lot less dangerous. Even if you use a condom, there is still that chance. <br>  <br>  By the way i am 14 and my boyfriend is 15, so don't think this is some 30 year old woman telling you your too young.|`|faOBk7qtaa	Take a walk and do it at a park in the dark.|`|IFz3MvQeaa	Tell him to be really nice to you in front of your parents and tell him to shake your fathers hand when he walks in.|`|kwaYWYzSaa	Well first of all, you shouldn't even think about having sex if your 14 years old! Just think. What if that condom breaks? Your just going to ruin your life. Don't let him talk you into it. because honestly, if he really respects you and loves you, he could wait until you two are married. And once a guy gets sex out of that girl, he is just going to leave. I'm really not trying to be mean, but that's the truth.|`|8a7eS563aa	cough* cough * thinkk u left this part out , ! .
30iqJREVaa	This is common. I'm sure we have all being in this position. He was yours and yes you broke up with him, but we can't stand them being happy with anyone else.<br>  <br>  The feeling will subside and as you get older (like older teens), it will be easier to handle|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	ur not over him...u feel lyk ur over him and want to b..but ur really not..<br>  <br>  sum other ppl r lyk that 2. ur not alone..... u wont b so jelous eventually..<br>  <br>  GUd luck|`|kmV5MnvPaa	My guess : Probably because you had feelings for him at one point and there not all gone. just ignore him, there is a chance he is trying to make you jealous so, don't let him :D|`|sCCjAKllaa	You broke up with him, so I don't get why you're jealous.|`|06O8FaOjaa	PROBLEY CUS YU STILL MITE HAVE A LIL BIT OF FEELINGS FOR HYM|`|d36OrpbDaa	Because you assumed right, that he was rebounding.  But don't let it bother you that much.  Relationships of only a few weeks or months are not very serious.  You are still young and have a LOT of future romance waiting for you.  It will be deeper, more meaningful, and much better when you are older. :)<br>  <br>  This is how things go when you are still in middle/high school.  It gets better, don't worry!|`|2xhwKw4aaa	well for me i just found out that i still have feelings for a few of my ex's and i personally dont know what to do but i just talk to them alot and we kinda just goof off but not in a bad way and we get by... but if he tried to get you pack and your getting jealous you probably still like/have feelings for him.<br>  <br>  sorry if i didnt help but yeah i tried.?!|`|9kgCiU58aa	past feelings always get to you, whether you want them to or not. maybe he's trying to make you feel bad, or if your relationship with this new boy isn't like you want it to be, and you wish you could be him. don't worry about it, your ex's will most likely always find new love. just concentrate on being happy. if you wish, talk about it with the new boy and maybe you'll get some comfort from him ;]|`|dvNWbUgLaa	I think you just wanted him to like you even though you didn't really like him.  It hurt your feelings that he moved on.  But you can't have all the boys to yourself, so find the one you like the most and just be happy.|`|YYcR6lESaa	It is completely normal to want to see an ex alone. know matter how you feel about them weather you love hate or just dont care about the person you will for some time feel like that person belongs to you. it will pass.|`|QO5xD82xaa	i guess maybe you don't realize what you've lost until you see someone else appreciate it
Yl0ehKj1aa	maybe he dont like u or want to tlk to u....or maybe he might not have his phone no, he just dont like u and he dont want to tell you. Dont want to hurt ur feelings|`|ekRAbQ6Uaa	hmm yeah sorry to say hes not that interested in you because if i doesn't write back in any way he is trying  to ignore you and then make up excuses to your friends and yeah you should Just move on and get over it theres other fishes in the sea|`|gMYoi210aa	his cell phone fell in the toilet...and cant get another one cause that was his 6th cell phone this week <br>  <br>  his computer exploded and has to wait for the HP guys to send him another one...<br>  <br>  u never know...|`|tkVCjeqmaa	He's not interested..|`|v2O4aQxWaa	He isn't interested.<br>  Your friends are probably saying those things to make you feel better about him not answering.<br>  <br>  I suggest you go see 'He's Just Not That Into You' it's actually very enlightening on this subject.|`|YkzPfyp2aa	Casually tell him that you have text him and if he received your messages.  See what he says.|`|To4m1n2Caa	I think if he wanted to get in touch with you, he would find a way..He has to be on his phone sometimes, and see your message...If you know where he hangs out try to meet him there..good luck|`|7tyolgpqaa	He's just not that into you.  Sorry.  Pick a new guy.  There are lots of them.|`|gqHy3821aa	Look, just ask him.<br>  <br>  Say 'do you not want to speak to me or something because you never return my messages.'|`|qoGov6Ewaa	He isn't interested|`|uAPntfQ5aa	Maybe he just doesn't know what to say... did you leave on good terms?
J5zj8dWRaa	Sometimes, you need to leave things alone.  Fight your own fights, and let your boyfriend fight his.  It's up to him to stop the "slavery", as you put it - not you.  You can mention it once to him, see what he says, then drop it unless he brings it up again.|`|hLohtlPEaa	If he's not your husband, it's none of your business. If it's bothering him, he should be the one to speak up.|`|W0633l18aa	I would say don't confront but get him to <br>  <br>  He must be bothered by this treatment so goad him into confronting and maybe back him up is he wants it<br>  <br>  see if he can sway his dad as he seems more leniant and then they can gang up together. As he is a twin he might be able to get him on his side on top of that. <br>  <br>  gd luck|`|YQhFTkdbaa	That's so awkward, i really not sure how to deal with it.<br>  Maybe u should talk to ur B/F about it? I know u don't want to see him hurt etc, but it may get worse for him if u confront his Mother.<br>  Just be there for him and help him if he needs it, he would also feel slightly girly if his g/f was sticking up for him.<br>  Good luck, hope u sort it out some time xxxx|`|PkZ1Lrpnaa	Stay out of it.. if your boyfriend has a problem with how he is being treated he should talk to his mom by himself.  He is a grown man, so if he has an issue he should speak up.  If they already are favoring other family members, they will completely freak out if you say something. It can make his situation worse.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Rule no. one in life:  don't attempt something which has no chance of success.<br>  <br>  If you confront the mother, which every instinct screams at you to do:  you can only make things worse for him.<br>  <br>  if you alert him to what he's going through, you can only make him miserable.  <br>  <br>  This is the most awful thing I have ever said, and I've had to do this myself:  you have to say nothing, but promise yourself that when he leaves home, and he's escaped this torture, you will remind him of what he went through.  He will have to deal with it when he leaves home or he will either stay the slave, or become a bully.  In the mean-time, act natural, be there for him, say nothing to him about his mother (puts him in a position of betrayal and loss of security/self esteem that goes with it, which puts him in a weaker position with her than he already was.)  Let him talk about her if he wants to, but say nothing yourself unless he invites it.  <br>  <br>  This is really hard:  it's such a hard one.  I've done this all ways but this in the end works best, because the worst thing in life to have to deal with is not actually an unloving or insensitive mother, it's actually self pity. Self pity leads to suicide:  so don't give him pity.  Give him a distraction.  Give him something else to think about: ie entertain him, be his pal and his friend: but don't try to save him because you can only make it worse.  Let him get through these years with the least misery possible.
Whd6tqLzaa	Your question is not clear. Do you want to write a letter about your feelings and concerns? Or do you want the YA draft a letter for you?|`|0SIhrYCbaa	What is the question here?|`|2keIEMFUaa	What are you asking?  Are you asking should you write a letter? or Has your parents written you a letter?

h7igZipgaa	Aww you seem like a sweet guy<br>  Stay with her because one day she will really get hurt (physically and mentally) But then your there by her side and you can make her feel better. She likes you. You just have to wait. Great things are worth waiting for! Just wait and your time will come. Comfort her care about her keep in touch with her :]<br>  Just dont do anything to upset this boyfriend he sounds visicous!<br>  Keep on waiting!<br>  Stay with her sweety.|`|XgMK07rEaa	you sound like you would treat her alot better and she is messing you around. If you are serious about you and her sit her down and tell her how you fell then tell her you don't like her leaving you hangin and you want to know if she wants you two to get together then you will have your answer. good luck .. maybe even show her this question so she knows how serious you are|`|0DOZKXwRaa	Let her be. She isn't ready to be in a good relationship and nothing you can do can change that. When she decides to leave the jerk she is with for good, then be there for her. Until then the only thing you can do is be a shoulder to lean on.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Run for your life, she's not being fair on you.  I hate to say this: but maybe he hits her because she's so thoroughly manipulative and he can't handle it?<br>  <br>  you're 17, a romantic and loving age.  You are warm hearted, you are trying to pluck this moth off the windscreen but you can't, you haven't the power.  <br>  <br>  And ask yourself:  why aren't you attracted to the sweet nice girls?  Why are you after this chick who is bad to you?  Why would she like a nice boy if you don't like a nice girl?  Why are you attracted to this bad girl?  She is not a moth on the windscreen, she is a sentient young adult making choices in her own interests.  What's happening to her AMUSES HER.  It's ENTERTAINING to her.  When you rtealise this, you realise you're not really that into her after all.  It's all a game and she's LOVING EVERY MINUTE and ripping your heart out as she goes.<br>  <br>  Ouch, sorry.  I'm so cruel, and I don't wish to be, but you deserve better than this, so flaming well demand it.  And go date someone with a similar level of intelligence/sweetness to yourself.  This girl will lead you a HECK of a dance if you let her, so don't let her.  She does NOT need saving she is having the TIME OF HER LIFE.|`|wrzp7pTHaa	The others are right I think that you need to just move on to someone that does deserve u...don't just obsess over that girl there are others that are out there, i understand that she means alot to u but its not worth you wasting ur time on her while she is out there with other guys.. :)|`|YQhFTkdbaa	If she gets back with him then she is into the 'bad boy' 'tough guy' type of person. You are too nice and so should stop trying.<br>  Maybe if u do stop trying she will like u more and take notice.|`|MenTTJ8zaa	your too much of a nice guy, you type retardly, and you use quotations for no real reason.<br>  <br>  i think you should give up on her and find someone who will make your toes curl|`|RJAcZIP7aa	Dude she's just going to mess with you. She's into the other guy and is going to use you when she's not with him or whatever. Yeah, she should leave the other dude cuz you sound much better, but us girls are weird like that we like the guys that aren't good for us. I suggest you spend your time with someone who deserves you and is able to realize it.
m3AFJaqHaa	seems like you know what you want, and how you will treat a girl.<br>  she is too young to understand her own emotions and she is obviously lacking self-respect or she would not be with him.<br>  <br>  i think if you care for her safety at all, you will let the police or someone in authority know right away what is going on. if anything, tell her parents. she may end up having negative feelings towards you, or feeling betrayed, but as long as you know its the right tihng, then do it.<br>  <br>  later on she will thank you, and you may never know it, but she will be grateful.|`|4EWCegiRaa	Answerer #1 couldn't be any more correct.  She got it.<br>  <br>  Nice guy + Girl who likes loser = Heartbreak for you 100% of the time.|`|i15KoiJhaa	I think we all know someone like this...<br>  <br>  They say they want a Good Guy/Girl to be nice to them... but truth is, you typically see the same Guys/Girls with a** clowns that they cry over and commiserate with their Friends about what a jerk they are only to find them right back with the same person.<br>  <br>  There is nothing to be done here darling.. she knows how you feel about her and she still chooses to be with the douche bag she's with.<br>  <br>  Find someone who wants to be treated well, you will be a lot happier without the drama that she provides.
W0ltl4ulaa	If your male,man up an say your sorry an move on. <br>  If your female put your big girl pants on a say your sorry an move on.<br>  There is no respect lost with an apology.|`|oojO4WAraa	What will you accomplish by apologizing?    Are you doing it because you still want her back?   You need to ask yourself WHY you want to apologize and what you think you will gain by apologizing.<br>  <br>  Apologizing for a mistake you made shouldn't make you lose self respect.  But, if it is just an extenstion of your previous attempt to get her to talk to you again - then forget it, and move on.  You will look desperate.|`|2S2onP86aa	Do not beg and plead, you can do this at first, but not for a long period of time. Because this way, she will take power. <br>  <br>  However, just tell her how sorry you are and that you sincerely apologize for what happened before. If she decided to be your friend again, then that is great. If she kept avoiding you and never forgave you, then you did your job and tried your best, move on. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|kuHE3z2Maa	You've got this backwards. It would be disrespectful to yourself if you didn't apologize. Saying sorry when you've hurt someone is just the appropriate thing to do. <br>  <br>  How can you lose self-respect for doing the right thing??|`|rv2PHuNPaa	i always feel liek i will if i do, but the god to honest truth it makes you look better, stronger and people enjoy that, say sorry, say ti sincerley|`|OX3tG9ndaa	I think apologizing gains your self respect more than it does deplete it. You need to know when to step back and realize that you are wrong in some instances.
AA11015829	umm there's no pic- so i cant tell- sorry|`|RDz4LmHDaa	what the h311 you want us to say!!<br>  <br>  <br>  you are too chubby?!?!?<br>  lose weight, it will soon hit those chubbeh cheeks =3|`|mywtmSROaa	Loosing weight in your body will help to loose weight in your face|`|mPxYJ7a6aa	Have more sex, it's good for your health|`|gMYoi210aa	haha you forgot the pic dude|`|Ix2eWrswaa	there is not even a picture so it is kind of hard to tell
mEMQWNnjaa	Again, This is getting irritating. Listen you are making a generalization. Not all guys are like that! The reason why SOME are like is because they like you and think you beautiful so they are shy and don't want to look stupid in front of you. In a sense you have a power over them don't abuse it.|`|V12HSfNAaa	It happened to me a lot as well and the only guy who really had the nerve to talk to me and say the right things to me. who happens to be my boyfriend now, is really gorgeous and has a big dong...lol. so yes it really depends on beauty or the tool down there.

When I was a kid, I may have been, but I don't now.<br>  <br>  If you ask me whether this is normal - for shy guys n girls it is and it does get annoying.

Sadly, the best kissing only ever happens in films!!  Reality for most of us is somewhere between a peck on the cheek and gagging on the other persons tongue (bleeurgh).

Whd6tqLzaa	Nothing is required. If you both have families in India, they will arrange for a traditional wedding. You don't have to be religious to be a part of the ceremony. If you are against the religious part of the ceremony, then have a court marriage and a lavish reception.|`|WrlD4xn6aa	marry in your own country.|`|7yW3UUN4aa	You require a lawyer who can guide you about the laws of marriage in India.

This could be a movie he's interested in,  you could just go for coffee and talk about something you have a common interest in (even though you usually do this online), or maybe there's a street fair or some other activity going on that you could go to together.|`|twVyisGnaa	Ask him out, but make sure that he's interested in you and not just to get in your pants.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|DYDKqrFmaa	Just do it whats the worst that can happen he says no and you can both carry on with your life's oh and btw most of us guys will never turn down a date if we are single hope that helps and remember just ask him the worst that can happen is that he says no|`|g49sKdGlaa	yeah I wouldnt personaly ask a guy out i like it wen they ask me<br>  but the sexy think aint 4 me either<br>  they usually say names like that wen they dont rly ccare and tlking to some other girls at the same time i would be carefull and spent time with him just dont do anything stupid|`|v2O4aQxWaa	him calling you 'sexy' sounds more like a booty call then boyfriend material, but thats just one girls opinion. <br>  I think if you really like this guy then ask him out.  If you wait to long then he might lose interest.|`|nheIrL81aa	he's just saying that to get in your pants.<br>  if a guy tends to call you "sexy" instead of "beautiful" he's not for real.
KAfUROLjaa	Well if you you have any classes to him where you sit near him or something. Talk to him and get to know him. Communication is key to a good relationship. Try to become his friend and then work your way up. Have a sense of humor, and laugh at the right places. Don't laugh to much though or they will think you are retarded.

32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	Believe it or not...the engagement ring itself is nothing more than a genius marketing ploy by the DeBeers Diamond Company that's been perpetuating itself since the early 1900s.  It was a way to sell diamonds...nothing more.  Until that time, engagement rings didn't exist...only wedding bands...and even those were set with semi-precious stones like sapphires and pearls...not diamonds..and usually handed down...not purchased.<br>  <br>  We've just all bought into it I guess.  I agree with you.  It's the intent...not the ring.  If the ring actually meant anything, the divorce rate wouldn't be at 50% would it?|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	It is just a tradition. If a couple is actively planning their marriage, then they can be engaged.<br>  <br>  I have known many a people with rings who are supposedly engaged and have been engaged for like 5 years with no wedding date in sight.|`|29I8PWrxaa	I agree with you that the ring is just the symbol.  It isn't necessary as long as the couple announces the engagement/their intent to marry.  <br>  <br>  But on the other hand, I can see why some women want the ring ... not just because it's pretty or they are materialistic, but because if a man is willing to save up some money and give up some other things so that he can save up for it, then it shows that he is serious.  It doesn't have to be expensive ... just enough that the man spent some time and effort saving up to get it for her.|`|G50ucmllaa	The ring is often the sign of the engagement just as it is when you become married as well.  When single men and women see someone they are attracted to, they often look at the left ring finger to see if they are available....its just a symbol.  If you are that insecure about it go buy something that means something....its doesn't have to have diamonds and gold.|`|mkrKHQvFaa	I agree.  Many countries do not have rings.  It is just like hallmark holidays.  Things are the way they are because the jewlelry stores have made it seem that way.  Like ooohhhh he doesn't care that much if he gets you less than a carat diamond!  WHAT EVER.  My grandparents were married with a ribbon tied around their fingers and didn't wear rings until after they were married 30 years!  Then she just wore a simple gold band.  It is not about the jewlery it is about the bond you share together.|`|35ca96dfe65df4ee3ff9a38263deb1b1aa	It's an outward sign of the commitment.  I've been asked to marry several times in my life.  Never took them seriously unless they had a ring.  When I was 18, my boyfriend asked me to marry him without a ring.  We were "engaged" for a year before we broke up.  Same thing again when I was 22.  And again at 27.  It's just words until they buy you a ring.  A ring shows that they are serious.  <br>  <br>  It doesn't have to be a rock so huge that your knuckles drag the ground.  No, it can be anything.  A $10 cubic ziconia ring from Target.  Who cares?  The first ring my husband bought me cost him $40.  It was a fake fashion ring that resembled a real engagement ring.  It was pretty and I was proud to wear it.  It was a pretty decent fake.<br>  <br>  Frankly, if you can't afford to buy a ring, you can't afford to get married.  Even a cheap justice of the peace wedding costs money.  Everything costs money.  The reason I was so excited to wear my fake fashion ring was because we agreed that our priority was to buy a house, not waste money on a ring.  I wore that fashion ring for six months AFTER the wedding (we just added a cheap silver band to it).  We got our house...  fixed it up...  THEN we went out an bought me a real wedding ring.  His wedding ring is just a silver band.  He likes it a lot, so he never wanted to buy a real one.  He says, "Who can tell the difference between silver and white gold anyway?"  He's such a guy...  but if he's happy with it, then that's fine.|`|vCZuh3oDaa	I agree with you.<br>  <br>  I will, however, point out that there are a great many fellas out there who talk the talk (by discussing marriage with their girlfriends and agreeing to marry her) but they never walk the walk (down the aisle, that is.)<br>  <br>  So I say... as long as you have both made a serious mutual agreement to marry each other, and have taken some steps toward firming up that goal, then you are engaged.  No ring necessary.|`|GoABmevnaa	because it's just a symbolic gesture. In the old days, the guys mother's ring would be given to the future wife. <br>  Even now, rings still symbolize engagements. They do not have to be diamonds, just a simple ring.|`|E2X6B1Iaaa	I think it shows that you're really serious. It doesn't have to be an expensive ring.
pd6V0z6aaa	sweet dude where did you get the idea?|`|AxkVvgBFaa	awww how cute.  a steaming pile of crap in circular form with some blue and pink icing to take the stench away.  and i love the foliage.  nice touch.  way to make it your own, buddy.<br>  <br>  also, i assume by "while the whole world was sleeping" you really mean "while my tiny little sliver of longitude was amid the off peak hours of 11PM to 5AM."  because otherwise, you sound like an idiot.  <br>  <br>  and i can only assume someone with this kind of superfluous, haphazard icing skills could never be an idiot.<br>  <br>  and how the hell did it take you from 2 AM to 1 PM (California time) to make this garbage?  cupcakes are at most a 3 step process and take a whopping 2 hours at most if you include mixing, baking, and cooling time and then time enough to give it another 6 more tries in case you f@cked up the first half dozen.  i'm glad you at least clarified that it was California time because i had to run that through the time zone compensator to figure out how long 2 AM to 1 PM was in California time since they tend to run slower than the East coast.  I calculated 10.12 hours instead of the standard 11.<br>  <br>  so you only suck 10.12 / 11 = 92% of what i thought you sucked.<br>  <br>  -Mayor McCheese (with extra frosting)|`|OGIuahPNaa	AWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just be glad you both don't have a bunch of kids. Do you?<br>    Better for you to move on and see the world as a young man. Then you will be ready to settle down in 8-10 years.<br>    Some of the harshest moments that will only heal with time. Move on and grow. i am so glad i did. I now have a wonderful family 100 times better than fighting with the ex.<br>    It's all good, move on with an eye to the future, your life is ahead of you, not behind my man.|`|sCCjAKllaa	There's a chance, but I wouldn't hold my breath. She's obviously young and not ready for a real relationship if she can move on that quickly. You would be better off just forgetting about her, because all it'll do is increase your pain when you think about her.|`|BljwgBNUaa	THEN LET HER GO...<br>  WHEN THERE'S NO LOVE THERE'S NO REASON TO CONTINUE WITH THE RELATIONSHIP
TJ2EfH7oaa	Let me get this straight:  They are bragging about being loose floozies?  They are bragging that their ******* are big enough to be steering wheel covers? ha!<br>  That won't last long!<br>  Stand your ground!  Obviously, you know [what is] the right thing to do.  Just as soon as one of your friends comes down with a STD, or one of them gets pregnant (without meaning to), they will change their tune. After all, crabs are not all that cool, right?<br>   Until then, stick to your guns.  Your logic is correct, and time will prove you right!  They will learn, hopefully sooner than later, that being a little whore is not all that great.. Just sit back and watch their dialog change! Be a good friend, when that happens...don't rub it in their face, but make sure they know that your stance was the right choice after all.<br>  I commend you.  Good job!|`|OCMSTxYfaa	Aren't you able to think for yourself?  As my kids were growing up, the thing that seemed to help them be self-assertive and able to handle any situation is as follows:  <br>  You can walk into a room filled with 25 people, and everyone in there will have a different opinion, and when you walk out that door, the only opinion that matters is yours!!!!!!|`|PDqZH4QMaa	well, if you really dont want to do it then. dont worry about them saying that. its your life not theirs. i mean. yeah ive done it but i dont walk around bragging. and just so you know. half of them probabley havent done anything like that. they are just trying to look cool. cuz they arent gettin any....just dont worry|`|iVru9qHUaa	you should tell them that you don't want to because you respect your body and relationships arn't just for sex.And or you can lie|`|WTtAX0AEaa	Just Ignore Them Most Of Them Are Probably Lying Anyway. It's Nothing To Be Proud Of. Stay Pure That Is Something To Brag About.<br>  x|`|YSAfYkPwaa	Don't.  That's called peer pressure.  They think its cool, but once they get babies out of it, they'll see what its like.<br>  <br>  Just keep your beliefs strong.  Don't give in.<br>  <br>  Btw, the internet isn't the best place to ask this.  Ask your own PARENTS.  They would know what to say (hopefully?)|`|r8ThtdMGaa	First off don't DONT do it you should not be having sex that young and like your friends are a little thing i like to call sluts if there are giving it up that young one quick ? for do they watch a lot of MTV i am writing a paper about the effects of mtv and they way kids try and relate to it. so but back on topic i think they are trying to be like to cool people ( well what they think is cool) and sex is something you should save until you love some one not just cuz every one is doing. im not saying waite till you are marred that just what your rents are going to say and you should talk to your parents about this just like do it when you are ready not when your friends are ready. but don't for get use a condom like i can't tell you how Meany girls i saw when i was in high school pregnant and 99% of them i never saw agen so they drooped out and they don't go to collage and they are **** more or less there kids are ****** also. so just becarefull|`|sD7d3Wgpaa	Either you can ignore it or you can just tell them that you haven't found the person you want to loose it to, tell them that sex isn't a big deal in your life now and that you have better things to do. Also you can say that you don't want to risk getting diseases.<br>  <br>  As for when they are talking about it just say either i am sorry but i am sick of hearing about this, or that you need to be somewhere and just Walk away or something. i know how you feel i didn't want to loose it to just anyone either and everyone around me did but i was like whatever that is your decision and not mine.<br>  <br>  good luck and keep it up you are making the right decision<br>  by the way you are more mature for waiting it shows that you are stonger and dont need to have sex to be cool, that you are your own person.|`|p6BXHhxnaa	Play it cool.  If people around you are just going into high school and bragging about having had sex, they're what we high-school people call "whores," "sluts" and "emos."  Don't sweat it- just because you're not a whore doesn't mean you should feel bad when those whores are bragging about being whorish.|`|IKpwMXTlaa	ok, yes i was going to say get new friends, but i still think you should, dont ditch your other ones, just make news who share your same views. tell your friends you think its stupid and ask them to drop the subject. i know that might be hard but if you just change the subject and act like they are idiots they'll get bored talking about it to you.|`|maiL8VsNaa	ok, what you need to do is say " you guys shouldnt be worried about stuff like that yet!" (dont yell tht at them though.) " you should wait to find that special someone when you get married." that should make them feel bad and guilty about what they are saying and what they are doing at this age.|`|YTasscmKaa	I'd just look at them and ask "Whats so great about having sex? A freakin' monkey can do it."|`|zLzwaCpcaa	Well, in your situation, I would just be honest with your friends and let them know how you feel. I know you don't want to appear "less cool" by telling them this, but I think that if they are great friends, they will respect your wish to keep their sex life on the down low.|`|lcjMqzh9aa	The ones that brag about how much theyve done are the ones that have blaitnently done nothing, especially considering you just reached high school!<br>  <br>  Ignore them and be the mature one that doesent need to lie about it =D x|`|ZzjUHawhaa	just joke around with them and say "only whores have sex before high school" just play it off as a joke and laugh about it. it should help keep you from feeling so awkward.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Just say " actually i can't wait to have sex when i find someone special enough". They should feel like dogs then.|`|2S2onP86aa	Actually, you are doing the right thing. Don't have sex because your friend did it, or because it's just a trend and everyone in high school is having it so you have it too. Wait for the right person, the person you love. Do it when you are ready. You are completely not weird.<br>  <br>  I am 20, and in my third year of college, haven't ever done sex in my life, and I am proud. I am keeping it after marriage. More safe, more secure. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you dear, and once again, never ever feel weird. The choice you made for not wanting sex just yet will make you proud of your own self and you will never regret it. Trust me.

rUrPCXYXaa	That was pretty thoughtless of him to write that, knowing his girlfriend would read it.  I have to say that if it were me, I WOULD be worried.  Seems he doesn't care too much about my feelings.  It's okay for a guy to have exes and still think about them, but people need to take care of each other emotionally for a relationship to be worth it.  Sorry... I hope things work out for you.|`|veHcKjxQaa	I would be worried, and I will put on my Ring the Alarm song playing. I was talking to someone and I was still thinking about my ex. And to be honest if my ex came back i would've dumped the person and go back with my ex. <br>  <br>  So yes, be worried, and keep an eye on him. Ex's cannot be trusted!|`|AA10199949	Yes you do.. ask yourself can you accept living in her shadow and can you accept being number two and if you can't  then your gonna have to not mention her name around him and don't give her any power over you in any situation.|`|19210ea4297045e16871c0f3287825d1aa	yes! he still thinking about this girl dats just wrong...u know if i was u i would step back from this relationship..it's not fair 4 u|`|OhwCzGWYaa	yes you do cuz if its been an on and off with them too its probably that they are still talking to each other so if i were you id be careful|`|QAiyrzZbaa	get him to notice you and take his mind off if her and get it on you|`|65ojSBXgaa	If this guy thinks about his ex I believe it’s something to worry about but easy to get out. I see you jumped to quickly that’s not good but it happens. All I can say is be careful if this guy had a long serious relationship with his ex it could mean he is not over her and still loves her even if the ex doesn’t. You don’t know this guy so watch out because you don’t want to be the rebound girl he will just end up breaking your heart. Now you don’t know this guy very well so it’s too soon to tell. But if you see it harmless and was a tiny thing then don’t worry about it and take it slow. If this act keeps going on then let that sick puppy go you don’t want to be the rebound trust and look for someone else….<br>  Much luck   -Gail|`|b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	Only if she decides she wants him!  Then he might go running.  Eventually, if there really is nothing going on with this girl, he'll be able to move on and not think of her so much.  Don't you have somebody in your past that you think about, and wish things would have worked out better?  I thought everybody did!<br>  <br>  If you think you had sex too soon, then remember that next time you start seeing somebody and wait awhile.  If the guy can't wait a little, then he's not worth having.|`|Jf0s6pByaa	yeah because that means that he would drop you in a second over her so be wary about that and also better yet talk to him.|`|ns1F0p8Laa	I think he hasn't really got over his ex b/c he don't have closure but if he thinking of another then something is wrong.  Talk to him and see where his heart is at.|`|6oMF0EIpaa	yeah i would...|`|Gy5OV6CZaa	Honestly? Yes you do. I've had really bad experiences with ex's (mine and hers) He's not ready to start dating til he can let go of all feelings for his ex. Save yourself the heartache and leave.|`|na8ObA5Haa	What kind of boyfriend would write something like that on his facebook for you to see in the first place?<br>  your jealousy probably excites him and makes him feel more wanted and needed by you, that is probably why he did it now that i think about him. im sure he was hoping to see a reaction from you! <br>  <br>  You may have something to worry about, & you may not. Ive been with my boyfriend for two years and at the very beginning of our relationship caught him texting his ex telling her he still loved her. I was devistated but for some odd reason i felt i should stay with him. & we have been together ever since, and i have been happier than ever. Dont get me wrong i do have trust issues now, and the second he Fu**'s up he is DONE. and im out of that relationship faster than you can say relationship lol. <br>  <br>  But i am the exception and you might be the rule. <br>  -from the movie "He's just not that into you" <br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK.

ZmdIlkpQaa	As foreplay, it certainly hasn't, but because we have five kids now, it's certainly been forced to slow down and become much more discrete in terms of random acts.  Still, it does happen, and it leaves a big smile on our faces every time.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	You won't be so keen on catering to his every whim once those babies come along and he doesn't help with them.<br>  <br>  Trust me on that!|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Nope it still happens in our marriage.|`|u7f0QB37aa	If he's stopped there is a good chance you smell bad,|`|09658fd4d02a5d3573ab00d1116b0c86aa	It actually hasn't changed. we both enjoy pleasing each other and that is one of the things that we both enjoy.no sense messing up a good thing.it was different with my ex wife though, she did it almost daily until I put a ring on her finger. then she cut sex out almost completely|`|AA10408380	For me, that's when it started. It only stopped when he decided he wanted a divorce.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Im not married, but even if we do, I can't imagine anything stopping me from giving him oral.

I want to give and play and be spontaneous, and she just hates it.|`|WrlD4xn6aa	no it doesn't, but i must say i admire woman like you who enjoy giving her husband oral, woman like you makes men never forgets them.<br>   my spouse to it for too, but she doesn't enjoy much and that causes her to not do it as well.<br>  <br>  your husband is so lucky!!|`|3VwquAraaa	No, it hasn't stopped. Yes, it was an issue for a while, because I had some emotional problems with giving it. But, since I have talked through my problems, I enjoy giving it.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Hasn't disappeared in our house...|`|41skve2Yaa	It got less frequent.  Because we were busier and I don't really have to anymore.|`|8lpJCOvmaa	Talk to your spouse about it. I'm sure if your spouse feels the same way that you do, it will not stop after the wedding. ;-)|`|KAoNgzcFaa	Yes it has something to do with gold and diamonds once you put it on there finger i think it releases some kind of chemical that works as some kind of alpha blocker|`|lnd249Lsaa	No it didnt stop.

I give it to my husband because I love to, and it adds something for me also.  He's kind of shy about asking for it, but I just do it when I want to, and he loves it!  Sex is just better for me now that we are married because there is no guilt attached to it.  I'm not going anywhere, and neither is he!|`|DKGiGbxGaa	Maybe you should ask your husband/wife why he stop. And if it something you can do to make it taste better ( try sucking on some candy, at sometime getting the oral sex) might help. Or maybe you and he/she should go to a sex store where you might fine all kind of toys that can help you all out. Go together|`|5khnqAdKaa	He definitely gets more oral now that we are married. He is a very good husband and when he helps around the house without me asking (huge turn on for me) he gets his reward ;) haha<br>  <br>  He loves to give oral too, it is most enjoyed when we do it at the same time. <br>  <br>  I can't wait to leave work now! lol|`|hE4LnuN1aa	Yes it has STOPPED completely!! Its crazy cause I thought I would get it more knowing we are married and I am not going anywhere.  I love giving it all the time.  Its just something about it!!!  Now u can see this situation isn't fair at all!! lol|`|YQjUs9aNaa	no it is good all the time|`|kbz5S3waaa	we do oral on each other almost every time we have sex, still.

So far in 2 weeks once.  We'll see how it goes but so far not the blazing start I had hoped.  Oh well, hopefully you won't have this problem.
kfWi9ZkEaa	Is there any grownup you trust in your life, preacher, teacher, auntie, - anybody, who you can tell who can take over this burden?  <br>  <br>  You're frightened:  who is near you you can tell, who can fix this?

My bff did the same to me. she stopped talking to me before christmas. But she always does this she'll talk to me and then stop talking to me for a few months, once she even stopped talking to me for almost a year. Anyhow, i donrt think you should feel bad. Just let it go and not talk to her anymore.|`|V7vzuFLAaa	i know what you mean. i havent talked to my bff in 5 months and dont know what to do. my mom doesnt like her anymore either. mabye you should try talking to your mom about it and see if she can understand your side.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|xFcXcjboaa	Tell her that you're sorry you can't go, but do give her a small gift and a card. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!
884v4VhGaa	The reason you feel guilty is that you're being responsible and recognizing that you're buying something you're only going to wear once. If money is an issue, then the cost will make you feel bad too, not just the waste of resources. <br>  <br>  However, remind yourself that this is a once-in-a-lifetime event. It's not as if you buy a once-off dress every 5 years. <br>  <br>  If you do still continue to feel guilty, make a pros and cons list. Determine how much sticking to your everyday values is worth vs having a fluffy wedding.  And if the reason you feel guilty is because your family normally has small wedding (i.e. you have exactly the opposite problem of everyone else, where the family insists on a poufy white dress, and the bride wants something normal), then talk to your family members. Chances are that a lot of the pressure you feel is internal, and people are ok with you being different.<br>  <br>  And please don't take my comment about everyone else having the opposite problem as belittling your problem - I am well aware that the same problem from the opposite side is exactly as painful.|`|nZj78jvYaa	you shouldn't feel guilty about your wedding, it is your wedding and you are the one that has to be happy with the memories for the rest of your life. do what you can afford and if it is better than the others then that is not for you to feel guilty about that was there decision.|`|AA11569421	You can find designer gowns on eBay for a fraction of the cost, if that is what you are feeling guilty about.<br>  <br>  Its your day, you're only going to do it once (hopefully!) so DO IT THE WAY YOU WANT!!!<br>  <br>  This is suppose to be a girl's day to feel like a princess, so no need to lay a guilt trip on yourself.<br>  <br>  Go for it...and congratulations!|`|Xa9PdVDmaa	it's your wedding day nobody should get in the way of that. sooo what they think you spent to much on the dress and what are they gonna do about it hate.haters  make you famous.|`|hLohtlPEaa	It's your wedding day.

My dress is perfect except for the hem being taken up and it needs to be taken in a TINY bit. Alterations total $75.<br>  If you go this route: find the dress you like, take a picture to a bridal salon and try on something that is the same style (to make sure it suits you). <br>  Also check out sites like. preowneddresses.com (or something like that). Google "pre-owned wedding gowns" and it should come up.<br>  <br>  Also, check your area for bridal rental places. You could possibly rent a gown for the day.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	No one would think that. This day is for you.

Make a list of what you feel you can cut back on - and cut back on those items - so you can afford the dress and the photographer etc. <br>  <br>  Thing is, be careful. You essentially have a beer budget - but you want champagne. So here's where you have to be really really hard on yourself and your "wants and desires" versus your "needs." Remember - the only things you absolutely MUST have on your wedding day are the license, an officiate and the groom. Everything else - yes, the dress, photos, and all that stuff - EVERYTHING else - fall under the category of "wants" and not "needs."|`|ACecbVghaa	You are a beautiful woman marrying the man of her dreams, what makes you think you are not entitled to an amazing dress?! You should wear a dress you LOVE, that you will look back on and think "I LOVE that dress and the way it looks!" Your dress should reflect your personality, whatever the price tag. A few hundred dollars for a dress is acutally not much, you should neve rfeel guilty about splurge on something for yourself! You seem very giving and caring, which is why probably you feel guilty. Consider this doing something for YOU, all people need a little pick-me-up, it keeps you going. Knowing you LOVE your dress and didn't "settle" will ease your mind. It is irrelevent what other people have done, that was thier choice, this is yours.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	YOU need to get over that...otherwise you wont be happy and the last thing ppl want is an unhappy bride...you only get to do this once and you should get what you like..within your budget of course..but dont do things to please other people..and your dress you'd be your decision...im on a similar dilemma...i have 2 completely different dress and different price tags too...most people here on YA like the most expensive one even my family choose that one but I feel like i like the other one..so im going to go with my choice..even if I am the only one who wants it...after all nobody else is going to Wear it but me!..<br>  <br>  its not selfish but if you are not going to enjoy this day..then whats the point...<br>  <br>  i hope you make the right choice..good luck :)|`|pfjxEZBmaa	No I spent $300 more than I originally had planned because I wanted it and loved it the moment I tried it on. It's my money, so why should I? Did I feel a little light in the wallet after? sure. But I'm happy. <br>  You don't just wear it once. You wear it at least 3 times for fittings. Once for Bridals, All day for your wedding, and if you do a 2 day wedding you wear it for the 2 days.<br>  <br>  PS: My gown still cost under $1000. I only originally wanted to spend $300 or less. I could still afford it, but I was iffy about spending so much on a 1 time dress, but when I put it on I felt special.
xJBJn6dOaa	The pick up lines aren't pick up lines. When a guy comes up to me (bravely) and introduces himself, and offers to buy me a drink (only if my drink is running low), I think that's perfect.<br>  <br>  I think the worst thing I've ever heard was when a guy came up to me, asked how I was doing, I said fine... and then he said "so am I taking you home, or what?"|`|b64219f408e63daa3f8c2cba4d84a232aa	BEST!

So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes. <br>  If beauty were time, you'd be eternity. <br>  If I were a stop light, I'd turn red everytime you passed by, just so I could stare at you a bit longer. <br>  Babe, your beauty makes the morning sun look like the dull glimmer of the moon. <br>  You'd better direct that beauty somewhere else, you'll set the carpet on fire. <br>  If I received a nickel for everytime I saw someone as beautiful as you, I'd have five cents. <br>  For a moment I thought I had died and gone to heaven. Now I see that I am very much alive, and heaven has been brought to me. <br>  Sorry, but you owe me a drink. [Why?] Because when I looked at you, I dropped mine. <br>  You look cold. Want to use me as a blanket?  <br>  Can I have directions? [To where?] To your heart.  <br>  Do you have a BandAid? I just scraped my knee falling for you. <br>  Be unique and different, say yes. <br>  Do you have a map? I'm getting lost in your eyes. <br>  Fascinating. I've been looking at your eyes all night long, 'cause I've never seen such dark eyes with so much light in them. <br>  Most people like to watch the Olympics, because they only happens once every 4 years, but I'd rather talk to you cause the chance of meeting someone so special only happens once in a lifetime. <br>  You're so beautiful that you made me forget my pickup line. <br>  You shouldn't wear makeup. It's messing with perfection! <br>  If I had a star for every time you brightened my day, I'd have a galaxy in my hand. <br>  If a thousand painters worked for a thousand years, they could not create a work of art as beautiful as you. <br>  You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams. <br>  Damn, if being sexy was a crime, you'd be guilty as charged! <br>  I was wondering if you had an extra heart mine seems to have been stolen  <br>  There isn't a word in the dictionary for how good you look.  <br>  Me without you is like a nerd without braces, A shoe without laces, aSentenceWithoutSpaces <br>  Is there an airport nearby or is that just my heart taking off? <br>  When I'm older, I'll look back at all of my crowning memories, and I'll think of the day my children were born, the day I got married, and the day that I met you. <br>  Are you from Tennessee? Because you're the only ten I see! <br>  I must be a snowflake, because I've fallen for you. <br>  Are you an interior decorator? When i saw you the room became beautiful. <br>  There is something wrong with my cell phone. It doesn't have your number in it. <br>  Baby, if you were words on a page, you'd be what they call FINE PRINT! <br>  You must be a hell of a thief because you stole my heart from across the room. <br>  Do you have a twin sister? Then you must be the most beautiful girl in the world! <br>  You look beautiful today, just like every other day. <br>  Excuse me, but I think I dropped something. MY JAW! <br>  If you were a booger I'd pick you first. <br>  Do you know what I did last night? I looked up at the stars, and matched each one with a reason why I love you. <br>  Excuse me, I think you have something in your eye. Oh wait, it's just a sparkle. <br>  If this bar is a meat market, you must be the prime rib. <br>  Are you lost ma'am? Because heaven is a long way from here. <br>  I'm fighting the urge to make you the happiest woman on earth tonight. <br>  My love for you is like diarrhea, I just can't hold it in. <br>  Hello, I'm a thief, and I'm here to steal your heart. <br>  Hey baby you're so fine you make me stutter, wha-wha-what's your name? <br>  I bet you $20 you're gonna turn me down. <br>  I'm not actually this tall. I'm sitting on my wallet. <br>  Do you have the time? [Tells you the time] No, the time to write down my number? <br>  Would you grab my arm so I can tell my friends I've been touched by an angel? <br>  Hey... Didn't I see your name in the dictionary under "Shazaam!"? <br>  Rejection can lead to emotional stress for both parties involved and emotional stress can lead to physical complications such as headaches, ulcers, cancerous tumors, and even death! So for my health and yours, JUST SAY YES! <br>  I seem to have lost my phone number. Can I have yours? <br>  Hello are you married? [Yes] Well I didn't hear you say "happily".<br>   <br>  You are like a candy bar: half sweet and half nuts. <br>  Excuse me, but does this smell like chloroform to you? <br>  Hello how are you? [Fine] Hey, I didn't ask you how you looked! <br>   <br>  Did you clean your pants with Windex? I can practically see myself in them. <br>  How was heaven when you left it? <br>  Did you fart, cause you blew me away. <br>  I don't have a library card, but do you mind if I check you out? <br>  Hey...somebody farted. Let's get out of here. <br>  I didn't know that angels could fly so low! <br>  There must be something wrong with my eyes, I can't take them off you. <br>  You are so fine, I wish I could plant you and grow a whole field of you! <br>  Is your last name Gillette?

1HTRWrawaa	If she has a job outside of the home too, then you need to do half of everything around the house. Half the housework, half the laundry, half the cooking (if you don't know how to cook, then don't make excuses. Use a cookbook and teach yourself, like she had to). If you have children, then it's half your responsibility to take care of them. That includes cleaning up after them, making them behave, bathing, putting them to bed and reading them a story.<br>  <br>  If your wife is a stay at home mom, then you don't have to do as much. It won't hurt you to cook dinner half of the time and clean up the kitchen. Remember...she worked at home all day. Unlike you, after she has put in her 8 hours like you did, she can't just quit, sit in a chair in front of the tv and have someone else wait on her. <br>  <br>  What really bothers women the most is that a man makes a mess of the house after she spent all day cleaning it and he just sits there and watches her clean up HIS mess instead of doing it himself. He also expects his wife to wait on him. He worked all day (she didn't?) and he's tired (she isn't?) Men have this habit of wanting a snack or something to drink and he will wait until his wife gets up and say, "Honey since you are up, will you get me.... We aren't stupid, we know that trick! Also when you need something, you act like you are helpless and can't find it and make a mess looking for it. We will tell you right where it is and you just can't find it. We have to stop what we are doing and get it for you. We know you aren't blind and we know why you pull this crap : /<br>  <br>  You want to know what you can do to help? Open your eyes! You know what needs to be done every evening or on your days off. You can see the dishes need to be washed, there are toys on the floor that need to be picked up, the bathroom needs cleaning or the floor needs to be mopped. Don't MAKE us tell you or ask you to do what needs to be done. We aren't your mother and don't want to be. We are suppose to be your partner and we are suppose to work together as a team. You see that something needs to be done, just do it and don't wait for us to say something to you about it.<br>  <br>  I'll tell you something else. I have been a stay at home mom and a working wife/mom. Not once in my entire adult life has anyone ever washed my clothes or picked up my messes for me. But a man expects and even wants his working wife/mother of his children to do this for him. I don't know any woman who WANTS to be Super Woman and have to spend every waking moment doing it all. We just want you to do half and not expect us to do 75%-90% and have the attitude, well I work 8 hours a day and make all the money, so you should have to do everything else. <br>  <br>  That's what my marriage was like and you know what? When I divorced him, I had less laundry to do, a LOT less housework to do (he was a total slob), I spent my evenings relaxing with my children, instead of constantly waiting on my husband and cleaning up his never ending messes and my house stayed clean and I had more time for myself and my children.<br>  <br>  Have you got a better picture of the situation and what you need to do? Don't think of housework, laundry, cooking, and caring for your children as a woman's job and you want to know what you can do to make her day easier. Instead, look at this work as something you are both responsible for and what would be your fair share to do every day.<br>  <br>  WOW!!! I GUESS I REALLY GOT ON A ROLL!

PICK UP AFTER HIMSELF. There  is no bigger pet peeve for most women I know than to see your husbands tools sit on the counter for a week after using them, the phone book sitting out after use, his socks on the floor next to the couch, and his underwear on the floor after a  shower. This helps a lot! Just simply 'picking up' can make a huge difference too! Life gets crazy busy for a lot of us (with jobs, kids, etc) and the house is just another job to do (alot of men don't see this -particularly if they take no responsibility for the house). Most men would get more action in the bedroom if they'd just pick up the slack!|`|WrlD4xn6aa	Dude, that"s a crazy question to ask women. they will have yo do everything even shaving them.<br>  pick the things you would rather do but make sure they are helpful.<br>  like the dishes and vacuuming, take the trash out and keep the kids busy so she can have a piece of mind sometimes. and of course give her good sex to keep he smiling|`|MvMMIxjIaa	OOOOHHHH where to start........................ its helpful if he picks up after himself, clean the bathroom after he uses it, cook dinner sometimes, but really if he tells me what a sex goddess i am, how beautiful i look, & makes me feel so content he gets away with doing the basics!!!!|`|ncWV2FwLaa	WASH DISHES,,GIVE THE DOGS A BATH,,FIX ANYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED AROUND THE HOUSE.IT NOT JUST ABOUT HELPPING OUT IT'S ABOUT SHOWING THAT THIS IS YOUR HOME TOO AND YOU WANT YOUR HOME AND FAMILY AND YOU CARE ABOUT THEM ALL.AND TAKING OUT THE GARBAGE IS YOUR JOB...LOL|`|A5U4EgPJaa	One clean the dishes, take the garbage out, clean up after your self.

Boys are stupid at that age... it'll get better. I am currently in a wonderful relationship, but the relationship before this  ended on our month-aversary lol. He called me and said he didn't want to be my boyfriend anymore. The next day I found out that he was cheating on me and that he had lied about A LOT of things (including drugs, alcohol and sex...all of which I did not want to get involved in). So it worked out better for me in the long run. Trust me, from what it sounds like, you'll be better off. Enjoy being single! That's what I did. I made a resolution to be single for a year, shortly after I met my current boyfriend and we have been together for 2 and a half years. Granted, we were in high school when all this happened. He and I currently attend the same college far away from our hometown and plan to stick together!|`|19210ea4297045e16871c0f3287825d1aa	my relationship ended six months ago and these were his words: "Figures..i got someone else on the other line bye"...this was b/c i didn't want to go over to his place..we still talk now but we are not seeing each other..men are jerks|`|6IqPKoUVaa	2 month and couple days ago, i got dump cause he wanted his ex girl friend back and break up with me in front of his friends,lol|`|vWBHYwdxaa	Mine ended by email she sent a cowards way out .

p9QglBpyaa	My husband & I just got married in October and he is currently finishing up his last semester of undergrad. His schoolwork is very time-consuming and it does make things more difficult because we don't get to spend as much time together during the week. However, I am still completely happy with our decision to go ahead and get married. If we waited on both of us to be finished, it would have been 3-5 more years, since he is going to get his masters degree. We knew we could make it work.<br>  <br>  I have come to the realization that every phase in your lives as a couple will have something to "distract" you and create obstacles. If it's not school, then it's children, or your career, or whatever. There will always be something there that you have to deal with and learn to work around. So my advice is if you really do not want to wait 3 years, definitely don't rush into things, but maybe wait until you are both 6 months - 1 year from graduating to get married. It's easier when you are closer to graduating because you know that the situation is only temporary. Basically, I just wanted to say that yes, it is tough but no, it's not "impossible"....it's something you have to be completely prepared for, committed to, and willing to work through.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	The question is why would it be impossible? You need to talk to him, find out his reasons, and discuss the whole thing - not with a mindset of "convincing" him, but with an open mind and understanding. In and of itself, being married while in college is not a big deal, but some practical issues can make it difficult or impossible (i.e., if you go to college in different locations; if you both live with parents and can't afford a place on your own; if you want to have a big and expensive wedding that you can't afford at the moment; etc). What the reasons are depends on your particular situation; you guys need to talk.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Take his advice and wait to get married until after you graduate and find jobs. Marriage takes a lot of time and effort, even more so than dating seriously. There is so much paperwork to fill out, and if you plan on changing your last name you'll have to do so on all of your college paperwork (which is a pain), not to mention you won't get to enjoy your first few months as a married couple because of the stress of school.<br>  <br>  Just wait. It will be worth it.|`|afI03mJXaa	Anything is possible. I would tell him that if you are in a committed relationship with each other and both want to get married I see nothing wrong with that before you graduate. You will have to multitask, but it can all work out. Now when it comes to kids then I would say that is something that you should wait on until after you graduate and have a house, secure job etc. Talk to him and have him discuss his view on you two getting married. Some guys feel they need to have everything situated before marriage meaning they want to have a house, maybe certain things paid off (car, credit cards etc..) a good job. If this is true then it is understandable that he just wants to have everything prepared for you alls future and I don't think you should try and push at it. Just remember that he wants to marry you and that he wants to have everything ready for you two's future. Good Luck|`|93Pq7zVtaa	Finish school, Im getting married 6mos before graduation. You can wait, you love each other it shouldn't be a problem.|`|29I8PWrxaa	What's the rush?<br>  <br>  Trust me, I know exactly how you feel.  When I was in my first year or University, my boyfriend at the time (now my ex) had been together for six years.  We were talking about getting married and planned to do it after I graduated.  Well I'm so glad we didn't get engaged because things didn't work out ... we grew apart and found that we wanted different things out of life and were two different people by that point.  You grow up a lot those first few years out of high school.<br>  <br>  In my second year of University, I met a great man who is now my fiance.  I am in my last term of my fourth and final year right now, and we just got engaged in December.  I'm so thrilled we are engaged, but now that we are, honestly it is hard to concentrate on school!  I want to do wedding planning all the time, I want to be with him all the time ... sometimes it's hard to focus.  I couldn't imagine what it would have been like getting engaged even earlier than that ... at least I only had four months to go when we got engaged until I graduate!<br>  <br>  I think you should wait til you get finished with school for a few reasons.  First of all, you should wait til you are finished and more settled down so that you both know that this is what you want and that you are still "on the same page".  Secondly, do you really want to be doing homework on your honeymoon?  Or putting the stress of school on top of the stress of the first year of marriage?  What's the rush to get married before graduation?  Just think of it as something to look forward to in a couple years.  I agree with your boyfriend.  He's probably not saying to wait because he doesn't love you ... he just wants to wait so that you can both enjoy being newlyweds and enjoy the planning process rather than taking away from it all with school work and classes.  If you be patient and things are meant to be, then you will get married in a couple years.|`|AA11090238	I think it would be better to wait until after college, after you have both settled into jobs to make that decision. People change during and after college. Inteests change, priorities change, etc. Give yourselves time to grow and evolve into who you will be as an adult. Don't rush into it. There are many things to consider before making such a big decision.|`|U5cj2E4caa	It's possible, but don't force the idea on him.  If he is ready he will let you know.  Because if you force the idea he may back away and have doubts.  Its better to just live your lives and be happy and let him get ready to be married to you.  You have a long life ahead there's no reason to rush into it.<br>  <br>  If you two are really meant for each other you will get married someday.|`|939486fd47e1ca3cefbbae1d7440046daa	This is a man who has a good head on his shoulder.  Why are you in such a hurry.  Too often couples will come into the marriage with tons of student loans.  Too often easier to quit college and run off to get married.  This is a good test for your love.|`|HvJ65W6paa	why would you be anxious? Do you think his love would fade otherwise? I think you will be happier and the relationship have better chance to prosper if you wait until you graduate.  It is one less stressfull issue to deal with when married.
8a8CZqGLaa	I had never cooked, and then when I was 17 I looked through my mom's cookbook and decided to pick out one entree to try and cook that I liked. I chose beef stroganoff (minus the mushrooms). Here's the recipe:<br>  <br>  Classic Beef Stroganoff<br>  <br>  1 pound of beed tenderloin or sirloin steak, about 1/2 inch thick (buy some kind of steak- round steak, chuck steak, sirloin, etc. Or buy steak already cut up into strips like stir fry meat, this is just harder to find)<br>  2 tablespoons butter or margarine<br>  1 can (10 and a half ounces) condensed beef broth (bouillon)<br>  2 tablespoons catsup/ketchup<br>  1 onion, minced (or I use a little onion powder, since I don't like onions)<br>  1 small clove garlic, minced (or I just buy a little jar of already chopped up garlic by Spice Club)<br>  1 teaspoon salt<br>  3 tablespoons flour<br>  1 cup dairy sour cream<br>  3 to 4 cups of hot cooked noodles (I'll put the recipe on how to cook the noodles under the main recipe for you)<br>  <br>  Cut meat across the grain into 1/2 inch strips, about 1 and a half inches long. Melt the butter in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until onion is tender (unless not using onion), then remove from skillet. In the same skillet, cook meat until light brown. Reserving 1/3 cup of broth, stir in remaining broth, the catsup, garlic, and salt (and some onion powder if not using an onion). Cover; simmer 15 minutes.<br>  <br>  Blend reserved broth and flour; stir into meat mixture. Add some onion powder if not using an onion, if using an onion, add onion back into mixture. Heat to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil and stir 1 minute. Reduce heat. Stir in sour cream; heat. Serve over noodles.<br>  <br>  Noodles:<br>  <br>  Drop 7 or 8 ounces of noodles into 6 cups of rapidly boiling salted water (4 teaspoons of salt). Heat to rapid boiling. Cook; stirring constantly, 3 minutes. Cover tightly. Remove from heat and let stand 10 minutes. Drain. Make 4-6 servings.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps, most men will want their wife to know how to cook at least one meat dish, and this is really easy and tasty! Good luck from a girl who only knows how to cook this one thing! =)|`|5Rxt5r0Raa	I have two easy recipes. These are my favorite tuna casserole and cubed steak smothered in gravy. For the tuna casserole all you need is a box of tuna helper, a can of tuna, a pack of shredded cheddar cheese, and sour cream, prepare tuna helper and mix remaining ingredients, put it all in a casserole dish place in pre heated oven on 350 bake for about 25-30 min or until casserole is golden. With the cubed steak all you need is a pack of cubed steak, seasoned salt, water, flour, and a crock pot. Season your cubed steak, place it in the crock pot, cover meat in water ( make sure you have enough to cook meat and make gravy) once your meat is done add flour and a small amount of cold water stir flour in add more flour to make gravy thick to your liking and serve meat with instant mashed potatoes or rice.

Its just not worth it. I dont know how old you are but it will all get old eventually. Just have to decide how important she is to you. If youd rather be with your mates doin drugs, dump her and let her get over you so she doesnt have to worry about you, OR try to see her point of view, she knows youre safe with her, not doing dumb things that men do lol. But odds are its not gonna change babe|`|1QT3dINMaa	Trust me, once she stops caring is when she's completely stopped wanting to be with you. If that's what you want then fine, go ahead and continue doing the crap you're doin, but know that you're also hurting yourself, not just her.

nX1QW5GCaa	I've been there and it can be tough on the ego.  Just encourage him to understand why he didn't get it this time and tell him you're sure if he can work on reasons why it didn't happen this time, then he'll have a much improved chance the next time.  He needs to ask for an appointment with the decision maker to ask what he can do to make himself a better candidate the next time.  Above all, tell him to continue to do the best possible job in his current role. Nothing will hurt him more than a perception that his performance and attitude have slipped because of this.  If all else fails, he can put his resume together and look for another company that will recognize his skills.  <br>  For yourself, just don't patronize him.  Be sympathetic when he talks, but listening can be more important than talking.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	When I am down my wife always tries to do something for me out of the ordinary to let me know she is there for me.

It will make him feel like he as a purpose.|`|TZWkf59Daa	Tell him that its going to be okay and that you will find another job and that you love him and just not to give up trying.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090219162414AAnA6Ww&cp=27">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  please answer!<br>  we are looking for best answer!|`|dVlLahozaa	just don't say anything and let the situation pass.|`|nk7a56ipaa	support him when he comes home tonight? get used to it hun.. sounds like you will be supporting his azz for a long time|`|29hcn9JRaa	The mere idea that he even got a job interview in a time period that wreaks of a failing economy, speaks for itself. Support from you will be nice, however if he is one of those types with a personality trait of having high standards, all the support in the world won't help, they say that the people who have high standards and who are hard on their selves are more prone to character defects such as big egos and poor self esteem, and people who do have higher standards do not take to rejection as easily as a person with good self esteem, a person who has good self esteem will typically brush this off with ease and take it all in stride, also many spouses who are married to a egotistic yet poor self esteem spouse cant differentiate the difference between a husband or wife being hard on his or herself, and feeling sorry for ones self, these are the types who wallow in self loathe, and throw major pity party's when they don't get their way. If I am right about your husband's character, then all the support and hugs in the world won't make much of a difference to him, maybe to you, but not for him, this will just have to run it's course and eventually he will get over it, in the adult world, their are many times and instances where we don't always get what we want, this is just something your husband needs to come to terms with on his own, this is what makes for self growth, really it is a good thing. Good Luck|`|6cZeMyyFaa	Whatever you do, don't baby him too much, just have a sincere confidence in him and let that show. Let him know that there are other opportunities for him, maybe one better suited for him than the one he didn't get.<br>  <br>  Give him a good night in bed too, that always makes a guy feel good.|`|QrbBQYKnaa	Give him a big hug and kiss, look him in the eyes and tell him you love him. He will know if your truly up for the task. Make him a nice supper, then put it on in the bedroom and tell him there's a better job than that and put it on him somemore till he nods off.|`|UqYdAn9Kaa	Act just like normal.  If you try to be extra nice he will feel that you are babying him and then get defensive.  Give him a hug, tell him you still love him and get on with your lives.  Unfortunately, this stuff just happens and its a learning experience that we all need.|`|8lpJCOvmaa	Don't belittle him about it or anything. Just say that no matter what, you support him and that you will always love him no matter what happens in his career. Besides, there are other positions out there that he may love more and have better benefits to them.|`|gVyHUSYqaa	When guys get rejected they take it hard, and they usually don't want to talk about it.  I'm the same way too to a certain extent, but just tell him that you love him very much and give your emotional support.|`|E33P5NLAaa	Just say to him that your proud of him and there will be more opportunities.

IE1LvgD9aa	Wow! You are quite the planner. All perfect so far.Congrats and Good luck.

You have nothing to worry about.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	Have it in the winter and all will be fine
wy5SiCS2aa	I think you should definitely go for it! I met my husband online, then we met up and started dating. Just be safe and if you do decide to go meet him make sure it's in a public place and don't get in the car with him. You know your love is real because it's based on things "real" relationships are based on, like talking and getting to know one another first, it's not based on sex or lust (well maybe a little lust, you did say he's hot) but anyway, that's what strong relationships are about, when you get to know one another first. You've already done that, so now all that's missing is the meeting. Just be safe about it and you'll be fine! Good luck!|`|8vfCRg7Caa	i dont see anything wrong with it. 95 is a long time thats for sure. And its not weird at all. Go for whats yours. The best time in a relationship is when people agree with other. And you guys both agree you want to see each and that you love each other. And im a computer science major so i know how boring talking about codes and methods and switch statements can be.|`|jdah4ZA2aa	It sure sounds like its worth meeting up.  I'm sure you know how to be safe, so take a chance and see.  Otherwise you'll wonder forever.|`|DvKOY0jsaa	haha come to my hoouse its 20 min away from ITtech LOL jk jk|`|sCCjAKllaa	I think it's nice, and I do believe you could develop feelings from afar. Thing is, I don't see how it'll help if it keeps up at this pace. It sounds good, but you two can't put your life on hold for each other because you might meet someone else.|`|YSAfYkPwaa	Online relationships mean nothing. In my opinion.<br>  <br>  I met a girl online and then we met in real life, and dated like the first day we met ... Not a great choice.  <br>  <br>  The person COULD never the same online as real life.  Some are.  That's up to you to decide.<br>  <br>  Take it SLOW first.|`|CSysSbnlaa	If he's hot, smart, and likes you, you are f'in lucky! You are lucky! Better enjoy it, go over and meet him, NOW! ok, going overboard. Get together, this is totally fine.|`|PM5WrxBQaa	well, my opinion is that it's not right to be in love with someone you've never met... that's not the way God has it planned for us.  So, knock yourself out and meet him if you want, but if I were you I really wouldn't.|`|gqvvXknQaa	See if you guys could possible meet somewhere. I think once you see each other face to face then you'll know if the chemistry is there.|`|eb9n9yhcaa	I READ THE FIRST SENTACE AND I AM STOPPIN YOU THERE! a guy on the internet! you have NO  idea who that really is<br>   <br>  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|54048f431e23af198481432570ea86bcaa	Online relationships are fantasy only. Meeting in person is the only way to have anything real.|`|Ki90Irkcaa	Love works differently for everyone. I have been smitten with someone online that I was like oh I cant wait to meet them. But truthfully you haven't been able to see how he operates. How does he react to something when he's mad? What does he like for you to do when he's sick? When he gets super drunk what does he do? Whats his routine when he wakes up in the morning? Does he go straight for the toothbrush or does he drink his coffee first? Does he even drink coffee or brush his teeth? Is he right handed or left handed? To me being in love is knowing and experiencing these things first hand without asking the other person. You just happen to notice that he's left handed. By routine you learn that he likes his coffee this way or that way. There are a lot of dynamics to being in love and I don't truly think that's what you feel. I think you are excited and you are smitten and the fact that you guys have known each other so long has an affect on the love aspect but true real love, I don't know. Long distance isn't for everyone and certainly I couldn't do it. I would just hang in there until you meet him and when you two actually get to interact and stuff you should be able to make a better judgment if you are in love or not.|`|sXU3RrfWaa	Im not sure on the whole "we're in love but have never met" thing, but to each his own as they say.<br>  <br>  I say that ya'll should meet up and see how things play out. BUT BUT BUT do it safely: bring a friend with you, make sure your friends and family know where youre going and for how long and make sure they can reach you.|`|v2O4aQxWaa	I think you two should meet up somewhere but make sure its in public JUST INCASE.  You can never be certain with the internet no matter what.<br>  But not all internet relationships are fake.. you can take my sister as an example.  She met a guy on the internet, they started dating and they met last week and they are as happy as ever.<br>  <br>  I hope my babbling helped in someway :P<br>  Good Luck!|`|NdyEAA5gaa	Sounds like "you've got mail" with a twist. Go for it. See where it takes you! If you know him well enough what's the worst that could happen? Just meet him in a public place blah blah blah all that sensible meeting someone for the first time stuff. You at least need to meet him in person to see if ye have that spark.|`|Fxp5Owfwaa	I don't think that's weird at all. You probably have a connection in some way I'm guessing. It would be easy for me to not forget someone who put a big impact on my life. Hope it all works out for the best! :)|`|2hLMsZueaa	i think that is so sweet, go for it gurl<br>  <br>  i mean some ppl would say naa and internet met relationship is bad and stuff but you guys now each other for 14 years and have always come back in touch<br>  so i say go for it|`|ua2VrPQ2aa	My advice would be: Meet the guy, see for yourself whether he actually is the same kinda person he is while online, and if you like him, take the relationship to the next level.|`|AA11619340	Go for it. <br>  Follow your heart, you know who he is and you know that you love him so there is no reason that you shouldnt be together.|`|MW1BiwhJaa	Girl its not dumb!! but its crazy because its not fair to u!! i mean both of ur families are where u are, u have never meet and U HAVE NEVER MEET!!!!!! trust me!! just..... if u do meet him take friends/!!!1|`|19210ea4297045e16871c0f3287825d1aa	well ignoring the in love part i think u guys should meet in person n see if there is a spark then u can move on from there...internet is great let me tell u but sometimes people lie with pictures.|`|FVC9r0PKaa	if you feel it go for it my daughter did and there due to get married sort of same way they lost touch and refound each other when she was in colleage|`|TCCgtrrJaa	IDK internet dating is weird but if you really think its him go for it.. sound like a nice realtionship|`|xSX9FRu2aa	go for it whats the worst that could happen <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090223134143AAiBdGx">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|FpwRrOwxaa	It sounds like you're getting along fine. Keep in touch. He's nice and cute, right? Go get him tiger!|`|BdHuBhizaa	just meet each other already!|`|oRwIEd2Daa	Who cares|`|g8PZinZKaa	I understand your qualms for this situation simply because "he's just some guy on the internet."  But it sounds to me he is just not some guy.  If you have been talking since '95 even with awkward disconnections, it still means a whole lot.  And it is not weird that he's always on your mind.  It makes perfect sense.  Even though you have only had an online relationship, I am sure he knows you inside and out. And that means more than anything.  I really do hope you guys get to meet.  I wish you the best.  And remember that he found you during that "break."  That shows just how much you mean to him.|`|DY75jDItaa	meet somewhere in public|`|YBISOapbaa	haha|`|SSsfaeGGaa	Well, dang. This is a cute love story :)<br>  Haha,  I'm not sure what to tell you though.<br>  I talked to someone whom I thought was a guy for almost 2 years. And we web cammed and talked on the phone and everything.<br>  Turned out, it was the guy's baby sister all along, paying him to video chat with me and talk to me on the phone.<br>  <br>  My opinion, is I don't blame you for being in love considering I was just that. I'm just telling you, keep your guards up. I doubt it's something like that because it's been so long, and I believe you should go for it. <br>  <br>  Good luck, dear <3|`|wtcHEbD3aa	It is probably going to be weird when you first meet him in person so be prepared. Also- the strong feelings you are having are probably more of a fantasy than actually love. However, I have a friend who is getting married to a man that she met online a year ago. They are completely in love and very happy- so it's possible! <br>  <br>  Another thing- be careful... it is very easy to lie on the interent. Not to say he's a 50 year old fat man, but a number of other things can go wrong (he could be married, a pedophile, ect). You just never know so make sure you are safe and have lots of time to get to know him in PERSON before you make any huge commitments. Good luck!|`|ns1F0p8Laa	It's not weird to love since you've talked to him for years.  But I do think you guys need to see each other face to face and really get to know eachother.  I think you like the image or what he's presenting himself to you right now but you never really know a person until you physically know them.|`|pJZBdpehaa	Seems like you to get along ok, whats stopping you?
rUrPCXYXaa	It's extremely flattering and actually doesn't happen as often as guys might think. (and no, that doesn't mean I'm not attractive.)  Rarely you might find a girl who's annoyed by it, but for the most part we appreciate it, even if you can't tell by our reaction because we might be guarded.  Just be sure to be as respectful, kind and gentle as you can.  Don't come across as harsh or arrogant.  There is a fine line between arrogant and confident- confident is good, arrogant is bad.  I do have to say, though, the odds of getting a number are pretty slim.  If you're in a smallish town and have a chance of seeing her again, it would be more likely to happen after you've run into her a few times.|`|mFAJG2E8aa	I'd just be like, thanks.<br>  <br>  That happens to me a lot haha.<br>  <br>  If I was with friends, I'd rub it in their faces that the guy didn't say it to them. [ :<br>  <br>  Umm...A random guy on the street? You wouldn't be getting my number.<br>  <br>  None. Lol(:|`|CpNVSJpmaa	If I was alone I'd be a little cautious and hold back a little cause after all you never know what anyone's like do you ?<br>  I think I'd have to talk with him for a while before I thought about giving him my number , if I liked him I would suggest somewhere for a date , if that went well then I'd give him my number,<br>  I would respond most positively if I was by myself if we walked and talked for a while , if he was nice , light hearted and didn't come on too strong.<br>  If I was with friends I'd like it if he talked to all of us and was very open and kind. But it purely depends on the impression I get of his character.|`|kdmhuVTEaa	It's happened to me before when i was shopping. It was really embarrassing for me and the guy. <br>  He kind off said can i talk to you for a moment and we walked out of ear shot. <br>  I found that much nicer than him saying it in front of my friends. It didn't work out in the end lol but that's just him.|`|vR6AwIppaa	that happened to me once.<br>  i was with friends too. <br>  i said no because i didn't know him.<br>  i would have said yes if:<br>  <br>  *he came up in person to talk to me instead of asking his friend to [lol]<br>  *he said a really funny joke<br>  *he had shaggy hair.|`|sCCjAKllaa	You wouldn't get any # from a nice girl with those odds. They probably get those requests daily, anyway.|`|fmkwdNJyaa	i like a sincere compliment and i would like a straight-foward question...thats all<br>  if i like your style you'll get it (maybe) deponds on how i feel|`|589XBd5Yaa	it's a nice compliment, but is very awkward if you don't happen to know the person from somewhere..especially if the girl was rather young in high school or even in college. I'd be slightly creeped out.<br>  i would be creepd out because usually if someone says i'm pretty, it's a sign that they might in it for the physical attraction. you may rather come up to the girl and start off a conversation like "wow, the line is sure long here. what would you recommend?" if you were in a starbucks. as for the street, that's a toughy. it's probably better to get a girl's number if you weren't just passing by her on the street.|`|06de8f8bd2139814a2ba53ab67d9d65daa	i would be so flatterd :)<br>  even better if im with friends.. because then its almost like out of all my friends the guy thought i stood out and apealed most to him<br>  he'd only have to talk to me for a little longer to get my number, if he didnt comeoff as sleezy and just wants sex or something like if he seemed really sweet and nice then yeah id defiantly give him my number.<br>  <br>  the best approach i would respond most positivly too would be:<br>  hes witha group of mates across the street from where i am with mine he keeps looking over catching my eye, slowly crosses over and says hey.. asks me how i am.. normal question things, almostas if hes known for ages (girls love confidence :D ) tells me he thinks im pretty (NOT FIT. or HOT... or beautiful for that matter.. i think beautiful is too much of a strong approach at first) or says i have nice eyes or somthing (: then asks for my number, and then he can have it (:<br>  <br>  x|`|PFwhxpZ4aa	That happened to me once and actually it was really flattering bc the guy came up to me just to tell me I was so beautiful! He didn't even ask for my number. That sounded really sincere and made me feel good. Someone coming up to you to say you're beautiful doesn't happen so often, it's mostly gawks and lascivious comments. Be smooth about it though it just seems more confident and girls love confident guys. I'm pretty sure you'll get a number only if the girl thinks you're cute. Best of luck :)|`|ze4Gt1araa	I'll feel so wanted if that happen to me :D<br>  I don't care if I'm with my friends it would even feel better lol<br>  The best way for him to get my number will be when he says I'm pretty to ask me "Hey can I get your number?"<br>  And the last question I don't quite get what your talking about but I'll say if I like you anything cute you is acceptable :)|`|tWvM6M0raa	if i didn't no the guy i would find it a little odd<br>  the best way to get a number would be when you see her say hi and start conversations and when you no her better then ask for her number<br>  you should smile and say hi, i would respond well to that<br>  <br>  mine please?<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090223122955AAe5TEv&r=w">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|MW1BiwhJaa	well girls idk why we do!! hah but  we like guys that act like they don't need us!! like idk.. i know wht u mean.. if u don't know her then try to get to know her soo she dont think u weird..|`|3lqjbusaaa	it all depends on if the guy is attractive or not. lol.|`|mNn7MyaPaa	1.

JZabWXGpaa	Here is an awesome 2 piece dress that does exactly what you are talking about.<br>  <br>  It's shown here in black, but was originally a champagne colored wedding dress.

Look online!|`|AA11569421	When I was 15 my mom bought me a bright red vinyl raincoat that was a floor length (maxi) coat but you could snap off a section to make it calf length (midi) or you could snap off another section and it would be thigh-high (mini).<br>  <br>  Thank you for bringing back that memory!!|`|2KdRxn3eaa	no, but you could easily have them create this discreet look with hook and eye fasteners hidden in the fabric|`|CFmE3W1eaa	No but it sounds cool and will probably save you tons of money.

XkSdLIbZaa	from what i know from personal experience is that when a girl says she likes me and we talk A LOT..and i mean nonstop texting..and than i find out she likes me, well i look at the clues behind that. and than i figure out for myself if i like her or not. and if i do than i keep on going until she admits it for herself. if i don't like her back than i usually do slow down on the conversations. because if i kept on going than that would lead her on. and you can probably see this for yourself. if you knew that he knew he liked you and he kept on talking to you like he did before than you would begin to think that he has a thing for you. and since he doesn't one can only assume that he doesn't feel the same way. of course, there are more stories out there, and this is just mine. there could be other reasons to why he has slowed down, maybe not enough time, or whatever. best thing to do is do some detective work and find out what's going on. but to answer your actual question, yes i would text back. i hate it when somebody doesn't text me back. regardless whether i like them or not. keep the friendship alive.|`|cIlQJ9hxaa	Text him now that he knows you like him ask him out!

Also, don't text him every six seconds...text him every other day or whatever feels comfortable, or answer if he texts you. But don't look like a crazy stalker person and tell him your life story via text message.|`|AXmDf9WTaa	just text and say you miss how it used to be when you texted a lot and dont want it to be awkward and maybe it will go back to the way it was :) xx|`|U1e7wJgYaa	text him back|`|nQncbjYOaa	if he txtd u then txt him back.|`|lnHKsijqaa	Don't ask him yes or no questions.

VelE30y7aa	Tell her, it's OK because you have been sleeping with her boyfriend anyway. She shouldn't be sad because he is not really leaving. He just says he is because he told me he thinks your a psychotic whore. Then her sadness will turn to anger. Don't be surprised if you find the boyfriend gagged under her bed.<br>  <br>  Or you can call her a ****. Slap her. Kill her. Shut her up. Or tell her if she doesn't stop whining you'll torture her, till she dies.<br>  <br>  Either or.

qBl9ShJBaa	i was engaged at 16 then again at 19 to the man i later married,so it depends on if ur truly in love if u are then go for it and be happy. there is not and never should be an age to get engaged or married.and hope it all works out.|`|nqINitkmaa	I think it really depends on your maturity level. I got engaged at 22, my fiance was 29. We both owned our own homes, we were graduated from college and had careers, we are both very mature and ready to and able to support our self's and our marriage. There are some 21 year olds that are ready to get engaged but there are a lot that are not.  ( I will be 23 when we marry, and he will be 30) I think that the two of you sound very young and very in love, an engagement wouldn't be out of the question but I would hold off on marriage for a few years, wiat until after you graduate and are established in a career.|`|jK9H6PHiaa	i believe you shouldn't marry until you are mature enough. while some 18 year olds are mature enough for marriage some 30 year olds are not. i think age is a number. if you can support yourself, and a spouse. have a house, a car, insurance and a job to pay for it all, and the knowledge on how to make a relationship work then you are ready. i also advise having a savings account with moneyin casee something goes wrong,unforeseen medical problem, car accident, or a baby.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	It does matter. I don't think it's about age but you need to have a good stable career, friends of your own, out of your parents house,have your own car, and know what you want to do with your life.<br>  <br>  You don't have that at 21. Wait until you are about 26 at least!|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Engagement isn't about age - it's about maturity. I'm looking to get engaged around 19-20. I know what I want in life, and I know that when the time comes both myself and my boyfriend will be ready.<br>  <br>  Get engaged now and get married after you graduate.|`|3Dhacs6caa	Whenever u and your boyfriend think its the rite time. 21 sounds a good age:)|`|afI03mJXaa	I would say a good age to be engaged is 25 or 26. This is about the time when you are not so immature and more responsible and have had most of your experiences out of the way. I do think that 21 is young and that 8 months is not enough time in a relationship to decide that you want to get married. Also I would say to get everything situated meaning the cost of living between you two and your goals as a couple. Talk about kids and the future to see if you are on the same level. Does he know how to save, is his credit good etc.. These things matter when it comes to a relationship and marriage. Its completely up to you on what you want to do with your life, but this is just my view. Good Luck|`|AA11090238	engaged doesn't equal being married right away. The answer is whenever you both feel it is right. Just because you get engaged a month from now doesn't mean you have to get married 2 months from now. It's just a promise that you'll get married really.|`|aipChC3haa	I'm going to answer honestly, 22+ is good.<br>  21 might be O.K. for the bride.<br>  If her proposes to you when you are 21, then try to have a long engagement, and being married at 23 in my mind is perfect, but that's just me.<br>  <br>  The PERFECT age to get married to is WHEN YOU ARE READY!|`|gEWMJYxXaa	A good age would be when you both have GOOD careers (not jobs) careers. I wanted to get married at 21...but there was no way we could realistically support ourselves..Now at 24, my career is great and I am marrying the MAN of my dreams next year (not the boy I was with from 17-21). Andwe're still really young!!|`|TJrRPIFLaa	I got engaged at 19 and married at 20.  I would say whenever you feel comfortable.  Keep in mind this is the person you are going to be with when you are 50 years old.  You must be ready to commit your life to this person.|`|G50ucmllaa	As long as you have the same plan, I don't think it matters.  I would however advise holding off marriage until you are finished with school.
h0EanKknaa	You cannot get your mom to leave her husband if she doesn't want to. But if she has expressed a real desire to leave, help her down that road. Let her know that you are there to help her re-arrange her finances, find a new place to live, locate services that aid abused women, and be a loving  child.<br>  <br>  She might need several tries before she finally leaves. Most battered people do. Suggest that she talk with a free abuse counselor over the phone (Safe Horizons is just one of many). Give her a list of free counselors or support groups that she can meet with in person (these should be easy to find on the internet). And show her all the fun possibilities that don't involve a partner (movies, book clubs, walking clubs, volunteering), as being single is probably her biggest concern, even if she won't admit it.<br>  <br>  But just remember to make yourself a priority through all this too. You can and should help your mom, but don't let her issues take over your whole life.|`|WVVdf4ILaa	Did your mom tell you that he makes her pay all the bills? One thing is what is his is hers so technically she isn't really paying them, they both are. If he is verbally abusive then she should leave him. she should just remember that she really doesn't want to live with him anymore,|`|c4pLY6Flaa	i think you may tell your mom to leave him but, if she likes him and she think he likes her. i think that she may stay with him but if she dont like him and you dont like him so i think you may tell your mom to leave him.<br>  thats what i think????<br>  do you likes him????<br>  do your mom likes him????|`|UvWqP00Paa	do it you will feel like the world has been lifted off your sholders, and dont look back your worth much more
bQR2Ld7Eaa	The behavior your BF is showing your son will harm him... think about your son, he deserves better and if you think that no one will ever want a single mom, think again.<br>  <br>  I'm tall, beautiful, and have a great job. My ex broke up with me and seven months later he was engaged to a short, fat, ugly, hepatitis C infested, self proclaimed b*tch, unemployed waitress, single mother from a one night stand. If she can get my ex, you can find a man too.|`|5fKtkCBwaa	I'm a teenagr and you might not want hear this, but maybe you should think about what your dealign with. Apparently from what I hear from you he doesn't care about you, because he left knowing you may not be there when he came back. Not trying to end a relationship here, trying to help you out. hope it helps|`|qsLhVZd8aa	I just don't get why people refuse to figure these things out BEFORE getting pregnant!  Your child deserves a father so you better figure out a way to work it out.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	A baby a marriage does not make...I was married 5 years (together almost 12) when we had our daughter.  We had owned our home for 5 years, had a dog for 7, good stable jobs...you get the picture.  We worked hard - and it almost fell apart after the baby.  A baby changes everything!  If you two feel like this is it - get into some marriage counseling.  You are right to request he be home most of the weekend (but if he works - he does deserve a night to himself - hell, we all do!  Even me - and I get a night off too!).  If you are home all day and he's supporting you there could be some serious resentment building up there.  This wasn't part of his life plan - and he's acting like it.  Seriously - drag his butt to marriage counseling and go from there...|`|QeyXWVi7aa	Something that I've learned throughout my life is that there is a time to hang on and try to control what your man does/doesn't do and there's a time to not.  What I mean is that I believe in taking care of yourself and your childr(en) first.  You should do things that you enjoy to do which may include doing things for yourself.   Maybe picking up a new hobby or two could be useful (I'm not sure what you currently do).  This will give you some independence and confidence within yourself.  Once your boyfriend sees that you are not at home waiting on him while he's out partying, he may realize that you might not need him!  Most men won't go for that.  So it's a little bit of reverse psychology, just don't tell him that.  In my life, I allow my husband to go do what he wants and actually at this point in our relationship, I push him to go do some things that he likes to do here and there.  It does work in reverse and you just have to trust that.  Mine actually prefers to do things with me and our family so what I've done really did and does work out.  And like the saying goes... if the relationship isn't meant to be, it won't.  Keep in mind that the more you "push", the more that will push him away.  I hope it works out for you!!!|`|AXbdNdPzaa	You gave him an ultimatum, and you didn't follow through with it.  He will not take you seriously anymore.  Either leave or put up with it.  He isn't going to change now.|`|IvMPh09baa	work what out?  seriously... what did he say to you to take him back?<br>  <br>  he's a party guy... he's going out... do you think he's going to settle down all of a sudden?  what makes you think he is done partying.<br>  <br>  sorry but unless he shows that he is ready to settle down with you, its a really bad idea to take him back.  theres not much for you to work at here... your telling him what you need, its up to him to be honest with you and either tell you that he is willing to do what it takes to make this work or not. simple as that.<br>  <br>  I get the feeling that maybe this pregnancy was some sort of plot to make him stay.  that really worked out well for you..didn't it.
vl8ND1qVaa	well first of all he got really hurt that you kissed a guy even though you werent together. he felt self conscious about what happened and felt like he needed to get you back so you felt the pain he did but thats not a cool way to settle things. hes just giving the cold sholder because he doesnt know wat else to do about what you did...well it seems like he was a down cold player b4 you guys dated. but the thing is he changed and it takes a lot 4 a guy to change...he does love you very much hun. its just that he is confused about his own sexuality...not like being gay or anything but it seems like he was very troubled and self concious b4 he started going steady in a relationship. he needs to notice that you have feelings too and he should not be too concerned with what you did compared to what he has done in the past. but you two should not make it a bigger deal than it is. if you two really care about eachother and love eachother then you two should be able to move forward and not think about it. make your relationship stronger. dont go forward 10 spaces to get knocked down 6..ya kno? and him lying is not cool either. he should not be doing that. but even though he has lied in the past you should trust him. i kno its going to be hard but you need to be able to give him the space. if he loves you like he tells you he should not lie. i think you should point that out. i mean everyone makes mistakes. he just got nervous and hesitant so he lied to see what your reaction would be. i hope i helped ya out..|`|2IK3PvAEaa	From what i'm reading...you were ready to end the relationship because  he kissed someone else while you two were apart?  Doesn't make any sense to me.  If this is something that either did or didn't happen while you two were apart then let it go.  If you really love this person then let it go and proceed with the relationship.  You you just don't trust him then why be with him.  Move on.|`|AA11136246	Its a proof that your fiance is narrow minded...relationship is supposed to be filled with trust, the fact that he lied to you showed that he would do anything to protect his ego. What if you commit mistake the second time...(May God Forbid). Do you think he would still be there?  Don't waste your time to a guy that is not worth your love|`|u1Ki6tSBaa	he said he only kissed her cause thats what you did if you had told him that you had sex with another guy then he probably would have said the same thing get it why would he go all out if there was a possibility that you guys were going to get back together|`|b1NMh5K2aa	I think he wanted you to feel what he felt when he found out you kissed another guy.|`|nk7a56ipaa	he is trying to make you feel how he feels .but i see you dont because you want your bf but other guys to. why must everyone be screwing some body else.. leave this guy and find a new one..|`|PN7XMglOaa	No offense , but , you new what you were getting ,.

Retaliation is not a good way to keep a relationship solid. In fact it is very immature.

Why did yall split? if yall were engaged?|`|lpiMi3s3aa	hmm... well the means he is a baby. And when you mad him upset he wanted revenge? Do you want to live with that? every little thing you get revenge? I would en it now before it gets to bad? He had sex? comeon ....he will probaly do it again|`|ZYXjLqJVaa	because he hates you for cheating on him.  He will never love you again, and just wants to hurt you.  Move on|`|izPkVvEuaa	i think he'd tell you that just to make you jealous and feel just like he did when you told him!|`|BDqgnPqZaa	Yeah not the smartest thing to do <br>  <br>  Yeah dump him before this gets serious|`|Yz9eCNMfaa	he prob wanted to hurt u cuz u hurt him|`|cWuZrQssaa	i hate stupid people.....|`|UEMakiQQaa	where u together wen he said he kissed dis other girl??|`|GrwWH5XJaa	Why the hell did you kissed another guy in the first place?|`|Jf0s6pByaa	He told you to hurt you because you hurt him if you asked me a kiss is not that big a deal and you should have kept it to yourself.|`|6R9McFZhaa	he said that because he is in love with you and he felt hurt when you said that thing to him ,first you would not say anything to him about it ,men are machos lol remember if they cheat on us they think they are macho but if we only kiss another guy we are b....... so for him .he is hurt ,for you the best is move out of that relation if you kiss another guy is because you don't care to much about your last relation ,face it ,it is better before any of you get hurt ...sorry|`|ZckxI1M5aa	You already answered your own question...you werent together.  And obviously he only said it to make you jealous.|`|OUo9J4i1aa	because he is an A hole and you can do better than that forget him he's a loser.|`|IbbQK960aa	you are the one that started all the kissing he should dump you and find one of those other girls."sorry"
hKWj2SJoaa	I think that you sound like the person that doesn't get into much trouble. <br>  <br>  Just simply explain what happened ... blame it more on the teacher than yourself, say that they were in a bad mood, or over reacted.<br>  something like that to make it seem less of a bigger deal.<br>  <br>  If you don't get into much trouble i am sure she will let this one pass, and you can even mention that to her to make her go easier on you.<br>  <br>  All the best x<br>  Jasmine x|`|JXTdMa3maa	Detentions aren't going on your permanent record.

CkN4pgpCaa	I went on one where we divided the girls into 2 teams and went out to the bars.  It was sort of like a scavenger hunt.  We had a list of things to find/do and we had to take pictures to prove it.  It didn't really matter who won... it was just fun to try and do them all.  If I remember right, here were a few:<br>  <br>  - find the oldest man in the bar and take a body shot off of him (with his permission, of course, and I suggest you do it off of his arm unless you really want him to lift up his shirt)<br>  - find a police officer and get your picture taken with him.  Bonus points if he lets you hold his night stick<br>  - take a picture of your whole team sitting on the bar. <br>  <br>  I can't remember a lot of them (guess I was having a little too much fun!).  Just don't get too crazy.  Have fun:)|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	They can dare the bride to be to sleep with the stripper! haha|`|mkrKHQvFaa	We did a suck for a buck t-shirt.

You are putting your brother in an incredibly hard position, and if he has to choose between his wife, the mother of his children, and his sister, who has been openly disrespectful, you will be the loser.<br>  <br>  I sympathise, I have two sisters-in-law who are truly appalling, but I accept that my husband will always see them.  However, this is his wife, and however much he loves you, this is a woman he loves, has children with, and has committed to for the rest of his life.|`|bspRfskYaa	You need to put the child first.  Regardless of your feelings for your sister in law, you should go and see him whether she is there or not.  This is a hard time for your brother and sister in law and Im sure they would not want to continue any petty squabbles you have already had - things like this really puts things into perspective, so go and see him you may be surprised at how she has changed.|`|WncalBziaa	i would go  its just the fact that even if u didn't go it will b used against u telling u that u don't care for him cuz u dint go ,,, i would go but u need to take something  so that u can hide her face with so it can b ike a wall or something...  just act concern never 4get how much u love him ... problem's in the fam shouldn't keep us away from each other during moments like thees.|`|0DOZKXwRaa	You and your sister-in-law are adults. Your nephew is a child. This might sound harsh, but act like an adult and suck it up. You just have to say hi to her, not have a dinner conversation. Go visit the kid, if you don't he is the one that is going to be hurt.|`|FncktQ4gaa	Just remember your going to visit you nephew not your sister in law. He will surely want to see you and if you don't you only have yourself to face after.|`|52p4lsSYaa	if it will help you please go, even if its for a few mins, you dont need to talk to his mother, do it for your peace of mind and for the little guy x|`|9RWjoJd9aa	oh good!<br>  tricky situation!<br>  maybe you should just go and not think about your sister in law?<br>  because your only going to see your nephew not her! lol xx|`|aIwRYOh5aa	if u care about him u would go|`|1HUXx5Qcaa	dlfg|`|AA12240972	Hmmm you've really made this all about yourself when its really about the well being of your nephew and your concern for that.  His mother (your sis in law)  will more than likely be there the entire time.  Your brother has no obligation to you at this point because you have taken the low road.  He should, as every man should, stand beside his wife at all times.  That's what makes a family - that's how you grow up and leave your parents and the cycle begins again - the family cycle.<br>  <br>  I say you should but out at this point, you've already made sure everyone knew you were petty during a time of need.  I'd let it blow over and hopefully you can try again to mend this fence.|`|ZhABW8uMaa	well if it was me then i wouldnt go if u know hes ok and in no extreme danger than it would be best to stay away from ur sister in law especially in the hospital cause u dont need to get into any fights it wont help u or the patients in the hospital|`|T5rGSRdQaa	I understand that you are upset at her, and maybe you have a really good reason; however, i agree with your brother. I mean, if you have a problem with seeing your nephew while his mom is there, than that is on you. Obviously your brother is fine with whatever his wife did to your family and you have to accept that. I dont think you should try and come between them; because you are not going to win that battle. I wouldnt want someone around my kids that didnt like me either, but you didnt say that she didnt allow you to see them, you said that u dont want to see them if shes there, so that is on you

Just tell her what you like while she does it and then do the same to her.|`|4c2YoX1Xaa	umm duh its wrong to get it sumwhere else!! have u ever tried to direct her on how to perform for u. jus like everything else u have to work at it to get better right!!! practice makes perfect. how wowuld u feel if she wasnt sexual satisfied with ur performance..do want her to get it sumwhere else huh? didnt think so....work at it have fun with it use sauces,tell her what u want/ how u want it.....goodluck|`|57IDs4byaa	No its not okay.

It is WRONG.  <br>  <br>  You should teach her how to do it to your liking then.

sXU3RrfWaa	Sounds to me like your current boyfriend is a rebound.<br>  <br>  This is a tough situation because if you still are feeling strongly toward robert, then you need to reevaluate the current relationship youre in. This is the problem with rebounding: when the REAL object of your affection comes back around, SOMEONE is gonna get hurt.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is stop and think about this, ask yourself a few questions: Do I just miss Robert because he misses me? What are the pros and cons of my current bf vs. Robert?<br>  <br>  While people may sometimes deserve a second chance, it shouldnt be at the expense of your current boyfriend. Really think this one through and dont do anything rash because some old bf reappeared in the picture.|`|sCCjAKllaa	Nope. You have a bf, so why would you hurt him over someone you previously dealt with? That's wrong, but girls like to do a lot of that now.

Just having the same feelings is no different.<br>  <br>  Are you really exclusive after two months with this current guy, immediately after breaking up with Robert? Take some time out to be single. You can date guys without making them your boyfriend. You can date more than one at once as long as they know you are not exclusively dating them. It lets you know what your options are and teaches you what you like and don't like. It also keeps you from thinking a certain guy is all you can get so you'd better put up with him or be single.|`|b153173553fd6524a2713f82c00cfb6daa	you need to think about who you really love and who would make you the happiest... <br>  don't think about them, think about urself... <br>  which one do you think is better for you...<br>  and dnt just be with ur current bf cuz he's a great guy...<br>  that's not fair to him especially cuz he's a great guy...<br>  just pick who you love the most...|`|N8J84PFDaa	everything happens for a reason maybe your not ment to be with robert or you just had to first realize how much you really cared for him
YTasscmKaa	Intelligence, confidence and a sense of humour.|`|Eit68exyaa	I'm a guy.  I like, get this -> imperfections.  Yes I get to uneasy with miss perfect because I am not. I like mistakes, the kind that come from being at home with herself, comfortable.  You see most of us guys really want, deep down, a personal connection with what is inside her. To feel not alone.  That comes when she does not try to portray anything. When she can feel at ease to, oh, show me her things, tell me her thoughts and ideas even if they aren't 'perfect'   That helps us not feel alone.|`|vR8bN1n4aa	Outsides are pretty cool, but insides are cool too. I tend to be more attracted to modest girls. Being smart is a huge plus, but I don't expect anyone to be as smart as me (I'm #1 baby). They should also be able to think critically, and be able to justify their thoughts and ideas.|`|otsuH97Jaa	trust. everything branches off how much you can trust someone.|`|HaEsRdC0aa	I am a girl but if I WERE a guy, I would think loyalty.|`|B3rsbNtgaa	Tuff question! I don't think it is anyone thing. When I think about the first time I saw my gf, the thing I remember the most is feeling like a nervous kid again. It's all about how they make you feel. Don't get me wrong, she is gorgeous but the way she moved, and her confidence was what caught my attention.|`|4Lzf3wenaa	I look for intelligence, confidence, humorous, fun, and anything else that will make me smile.  Oh, and also for her to be herself.

JERUmEFzaa	Aww Sweetie! She likes you! She hasn`t seen you for so long and she probably is in love with you. Try to hang out with her more. Try to save this friendship. The skipping and silly tone of her voice is a sign! She never said anything about not wanting to be your friend is that because she likes you.<br>  <br>  Dude, Next time you see her make a move! You be the flirty one and tell her she looks pretty, have a movie night and and get to know her! It`s been awhile like you said so maybe you guys can get to know each other again but the older, more mature ways..<br>  <br>  When she says she doesn`t remember she does , she is only saying she doesn`t because she wants to seem hip and cool. I have to say she likes you a lot and is showing you a lot of affection. <br>  <br>  The reason why she ignores is because she is nervous and probably really scared of what you think of her. She said she doesn`t have a boyfriend because she wants you to ask her out! <br>  <br>  Since she smiled about the toy thing than dude I know I said this like 12 times already but she loves you! <br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  If you need any advice go to my yahoo answers profile and email me!|`|nkpRxWLgaa	Wow! Long story to get to your question!  Maybe she simply feels awkward, herself, since you don't get to hang out very often.  She may be unsure of herself and not sure how to act with you. With a long distance friendship, it's easy to worry about how your friend may have changed over time and whether they like you as well as they used to.  You sound like a pretty confident person.  Maybe she isn't and this is how she's dealing with her feelings of awkwardness.|`|PDqZH4QMaa	she's in love with you but doesnt know how to tell you.....|`|YISeleCraa	She likes you. You guys are growing older and her feelings changed a bit towards you.  The smile isn't because she's happy she doesn't have a boyfriend. It's just a flat out, she likes you. Because her feelings for you changed, she probably doesn't know how to act around you.  Maybe you need to initiate hanging out.  When you see her, stop her & ask her to stay for a little. Girls are shy. (:|`|nHWmDirFaa	She likes you. I had a similar situation when I was a kid (11) and I was too dumb to realize it then. I sure hope you do, cuz I missed out on an amazing girl.

What are some examples of your friend's "cool names"? Most Myspace users I know of go by their regular names or nicknames.

kfWi9ZkEaa	I had it out with my father.  He was as slippery as an eel.  I couldn't get past the layers.  He would 'misunderstand' what I was saying, he would prevaricate, side-track.  He DIED with a lie to me on my lips, for pete's sake.  I mean, how dedicated is that?<br>  <br>  Your father, however, is just immature, manipulative and not very good at understanding what's going on around him.  He hasn't spent ten-15 years deliberately trying to destroy you as a means of destroying his ex-wife.  He hasn't spent your entire life trying to manoeuvre you towards killing yourself and he hasn't trained in child psychology as a means of doing it.  You're actually okay: you just have this sad misunderstanding.<br>  <br>  I reckon you guys can get past it.  Go talk to him and don't expect a response, men never respond, they never say sorry, they just subtly change.  They're like babies: they don't really know what's going on around them, you just go tell him what's what, and then ride it out as he slowly calms down.  Right now, he's confused and wayless, and he really doesn't sound that bright.<br>  <br>  Just go give him a hug.  Tell him you love him.  Tell him he'll always be your dad.  Dads get so terribly hurt and there's nothing they can say. They also get insecure as to whether their kids love them, and again, there's nothing they can say.  They don't want to lose face so you have to do pretty much all the moving.<br>  <br>  If you think underneath he's an honest man, it's worth it.  If you think underneath he's a total crook: it's not worth it.  But you have to be totally sure he's a total crook and I don't think he is.<br>  <br>  :o)|`|U2tx9gDHaa	My dad didnt want a relationship with me and it doesnt bother me one little bit.Its his problem not mine.|`|dVSv6o0Caa	Tell him how you feel and talk about why he feels like this. Good luck!|`|qQq23yziaa	Okay Honestly I want to take a shovel and hit you dad over the head with it here's why. 1) I am a divorced dad who had to spend 50,000$ (and fight like hell) Just for the right to see my son once a week and every other weekend plus two weeks during the summer. So the idea that a dad would not want a relationship with his own son galls me. it also makes other dad look bad. 2) I Had the greatest dad in the world he died in 1984. tell your dad that my dad does not have the choice to see me anymore but your dad has the gift of you-- Its not fair to all the other fathers dead and alive to throw away that gift

k59o2PZaaa	Don't be nervous. My boyfriend told me he loved me 2 months after we'd been together. We had spent all day together and all night at a fireworks show and after we got home that night he called me and told me that there was something he had been wanting to tell me all day but didn't know how and that he couldn't go any longer without telling me. So we told each other that we loved each other over the phone. It doesn't sound romantic but our hearts were totally connected and we were both shaking in nervousness/excitement. The point is, it really doesn't matter how you tell her. I would have preferred that he told me to my face instead of over the phone but it was still totally sweet because it was genuine. <br>  <br>  Best of luck! : )|`|YkzPfyp2aa	Just tell her you want to meet her saturday, dinner, movie, etc.<br>  When the time feels right then tell her how you feel.<br>  Don't put too much effort into it because it doesn't always go as you plan.

Accept responsibility for your own action and your own anger.  It's not your mom's fault that you cannot control your own temper.  Sounds to me as if you're old enough to realize that you need to take control.  Start by working thru your feelings.  Your anger is probably fear based.  Ask yourself what you are actually afraid of?  But do it in a loving way to yourself.  Get some good books to read on controlling your temper.  If I can do it, anyone can.|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	don't punch the wall because then you will get in trouble for the hole.  Go for a long run.  Run your anger off.

Try to talk to a school counselor they can be very helpful and nonjudgmental.  You need to talk to somebody when you feel this way it's not healthy to feel this way! I know the first thing you want to do is lash out and break things or punch holes in walls but that won't solve anything.  Listen to some music that will calm you down or better yet invest in a punching bag and release stress that way! Breathe!!|`|AA11103763	Go to your counselor at school and talk to them about how frustrated you are.

nXombf2baa	To save a potential fight, your mother should find out if grandma has a will. If not, it is not too late to have one made up. The next step is to have your grandma sign a "Durable power of Attorney for Health Care" with your mother as the person to be in charge. This will allow your mother to make health care, financial decisions, and funeral decisions for your grandma. Have the DPOAHC list your mother as the executor of your grandmother's estate. This way your aunt can not barge in and take things without your mother's permission. You don't need a lawyer to do these things, most office supply businesses have the forms in both paper and computer disks. If your grandma's estate is large, I might consult a lawyer, but the DPOAHC is the most important thing now. I hope that peace can be retained in the family, and that grandma's last days are peaceful.|`|AA11206135	Is your mother the executor of your grandma's will?

Grandma raised this auntie after all:  so she's getting out what she put in.  In short, what goes around, comes around quite naturally, so you don't have to get too screwed up.

hce6sWyAaa	A most ridiculous suggestion Sir B, and yes she is sick.<br>  <br>  I fail to understand why almost all of the working class constantly complain about their job and how they would love to give up work and how millions of common people make a futile attempt to win the lottery in order to be able to live a life of luxury and leasure - and YOUR WIFE, wants a job???<br>  <br>  Immediate medical attention is needed here - waste not a moment.|`|vvre3CUuaa	HA,HA,HA Thanks I really needed that...Whew.

Let her.|`|2YX18RE2aa	My word man.<br>  How could she get so far off base?<br>  She has a job.<br>  Her job is to stay home and cater to your every whim, even if it includes rough sexual play, costumes and dare I say, other women.<br>  <br>  These tough economic times have led many astray. <br>  You should tell her to leave the job open for someone who needs the money.<br>  <br>  I really do not know how you will be able to suffer through the indignity of it all. <br>  Having your wife working for a paltry wage while you have to pay exorbitant amounts for courtesans to take her place during the week. <br>  This makes poor economic sense.<br>  I should wager that she may have met up with some of those suffragette types who spout that drivel about self worth coming from the fruits of her own labour and not from her husband's heritage.<br>  I would not allow it.|`|AA11621340	My dear Sir Bobble Bottom. <br>  There you go stirring up the uneducated peasants again! But there are still many among us who so enjoy your humor, so let me try to answer your question, before it vanishes into thin air!<br>  <br>  You should actually be most delighted that your wife wants to work. If she is busy earning money - no matter how paltrey the amount - she is not out & about spending your money! And while she is out at work, you can entertain some of the village lovelies at your manor certain that your wife will not return until the end of her work day. As for disturbing the dynamic of your relationship, I wouldn't worry - she can still do her chores around the manor when she returns & will so be tired enough at the end of the day to return to her chambers as usual, leaving you to your gin and.... well, use your imagination here - you usually do find something to do once she's tucked away for the night, now don't you?<br>  <br>  You are right that she may be a little sick in the head to want to work when she could have everything just handed to her, but who cares? You come out ahead of the game as long as she works. Enjoy!|`|lnd249Lsaa	I think you all are slothful cows and you should allow her to learn how to earn a buck......just kidding. let her get a job to appreciate a mighty dollar!!!!!!|`|yLaRUgAraa	Have you ever heard the saying, "if you love something you have to let it go and if it comes back to you then it was meant to be",   Well if you let your wife get a job then maybe you will grow apart but more than likely she is like everyone else in the world and wants what she doesn't have.  Give her a chance to experience the other side of life and she will probably hate being one of the working class, lord knows I do. If she does love it then deal with that when it happens.  Give her a few months to do what she wants, and just see what happens.|`|CUNVZtPcaa	u should be happy she wants to get a job maybe she just wants to have something to do but if u feel she would be less of a person because she gets a job i would say check urself|`|m81dfyOYaa	Yes, that's really ridiculous wanting to work in a supermarket or office, she's stupid.

Take it as a clear opportunity to reinforce the fact that the husband is always correct. The humbling should do her some good.|`|Whd6tqLzaa	She is not sick, you are the one who is sick. I just can't imagine how she spends her time at home if she doesn't work. I don't think she has much education to qualify for a professional job. If you're feeling so bad about the gutter class, ask her to get a degree, so that she can get a better job.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	You shall have to divorce the commoner. What will the neighbors think?

JhvqUvlsaa	You'll have to address these issues as they come up, but do it in a way that shows that you respect him as well, and that you are willing to give the friendship a shot. When you bring these issues up, start by saying that you aren't mad at him, you just need to talk about something that bugs you. Tell him how much his friendship means to you. Let him pout or get mad if he does and cool off; then see if he's willing to talk again when he's calmed down. If your friendship means something to him, he will. =)<br>  <br>  If he just doesn't listen you are either going to have to put up with the things that bother you or not be as close to him as you once were.
BNAzjSO1aa	Well done for taking the mature attitude about this rather than just jumping in the sack with her and not worrying about how she would feel if you did split up. All you have to do is talk to her and explain that you love and respect her and are happy to continue to take things slow until she is really sure that she is ready for sex. Because having sex for the first time can be a big step for a woman. If she says she is sure then do not forget to use protection and remember to treat her with gentleness and take things slow as she may have some pain/discomfort for the first couple of times. Good luck try and stay a caring sensitive boyfriend|`|qL3dGTXDaa	Once she has sex with you I think your big problem is that she will want to engage all the time and become very very attached to you. Then it gets really complicated. The act is nothing.The painful breakup is what she will remember of you, not the great sex. This is a very tricky situation. You sure you want to be penned in at 17? If you do, your freedom is gone.|`|y4zYkceEaa	Being child-ish or clingy-like has nothing to do with sex. If she says she's ready, then she's READY! Just remind her that no matter what happens in the future that you'll always love her. Be honest with her. If you feel she's not ready then tell her. In every relationship you should be able to talk about anything. Make this one of the main subjects. Good luck ;))|`|kdmhuVTEaa	Please learn to spell properly first...<br>  <br>  If she says she's ready then all you can really do is just keep reassuring her that she should not feel pressured. You've been together for a reasonable amount of time so i doubt very much that she would be saying that just to make you happy.|`|faOBk7qtaa	Chances are she will regret it anyways, so just go for it, hahah|`|Bsf78pfsaa	she maybe saying it to make you happy and from experience she will hate you later take your time|`|n6NthDxwaa	Try waiting. 7 months is not that long to be with someone, and most likely, she will regret it if she's still a virgin. Talk to her and tell her you'd like to wait until your 1yr "anniversary". By waiting, it will become more special when you do decide to, and if you don't wait, do your best to make it as romantic and special as possible, and definitely avoid drugs and alcohol that night--get a bottle of sparkling cider.|`|sb9dWsiGaa	First of all, you are too sweet. Really, your girlfriend is lucky to have such a good guy.<br>  <br>  About the question, try talking to her more about the subject - make sure she knows your not pushing her or anything and that whatever she chooses, you will understand.<br>  If after talking she still insists that she is ready - there is no reason for you to refuse her. Make it a special night for her and do anything you can to please her - she will appreciate it :)<br>  <br>  Good luck <3|`|J7k4xJtoaa	unfortunately you wont be able to know if she is ready because you can't read her mind. But the best thing to do is to tell her exactly what you feel, and then let her make up her mind. Girls are funny sometimes one second we will feel very passionate about something and then click something is said or changed and we feel difference. Just trust her... its the best you can do.|`|ze4Gt1araa	I'll say sit her down and confront her, ask her if she's ready for it to not d this to make you happy because you don't want her to regret it nor regret you. And if you believe she's a bit childish than hun she's not ready you should wait till she matures up a little bit more.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|589XBd5Yaa	well, maybe she isn't ready based on your description of the scenario. i'd say try to add your own input that you yourself aren't in a rush either and treasure your relationship. and want the moment to be perfect. (only say this if u really believe so) Anyways, you'll both know when you're ready, but i wouldn't do it now anyways....first off, you guys are still in high school. there's ALWAYS the chance she can get pregnant..protected or non-protected.|`|kmV5MnvPaa	Make sure she knows that you are perfectly fine with keeping it slow and that she doesn't need to have sex with you to make you happy, and let her know that you like her for who she is. and before you think about anything like sex, make sure you're both happy.|`|N85XB4jZaa	you should descus this wit her, and tell her you respect her and you want to know if SHE is ready. all about her.<br>  and ask her if she'll EVER regret you.<br>  just talk to her and hopefully thinks will fall into place =]<br>  <br>  goodluck!|`|UKYDpztQaa	talk to her about it. and make sure shes ready. tell her youre willing to wait for when shes REALLY ready. and that youre totally okay with that|`|L7BUJey1aa	DON'T DO IT! It's an accident just waiting to happen! If you have sex, you and her spirit is connected. Therefore, if you don't get married when it happens, and then you break up, your spirit and her spirit are broken. How do I know? My mom told me about her experience when her and her boyfriend's spirit were broken afterwards. She said that she regretted it and that she should've waited and she was very unhappy when her spirit was broken. So please, think before you act... or something bad could happen.P.S~ You guys are STILL in High School! Slow Down,man!|`|mNn7MyaPaa	she thinks shes ready for sex and her friends tell her that its about time she did probably. or she might think that u want it since ur not used to taking realtionships slowely. sex makes things awkward. im 16 and i havent had sex with my bf, and im not planning on doing that until im married or at least when i have a fiance that i love more than anyone else in my life. just dont do it|`|hfypVAhKaa	definitely wait a little while and see if she still feels that way in a month. that will make sure she isn't doing it just for you and she really does want to.|`|OhwCzGWYaa	WAIT I DID THE SAME THING TO KEEP MY EX BF HAPPY I DID IT CUZ I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA LEAVE ME SO JUST REASURE HER THAT YOU WILL BE THERE FOR HER PLUS IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS OUT OF NOWHERE DONT PLAN IT IT TAKES THE SPARK AWAY|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	ask her i guess if shes 100% ready i guess|`|19210ea4297045e16871c0f3287825d1aa	give it some more time...there is no need to rush it..

Just try getting closer with him and then when you feel it's right let him know that you like him and hopefully he likes you back|`|tXVaf8o7aa	Right now it seems like he's not that interested.

But he may be afraid to make the first move.  Just give it some time.  Sometimes crushes don't last long.  If he seems to be growing more interested, put the ball in his court.  If you feel strong enough, then you handle it.  Sometimes being aggressive is a good thing.|`|ZSjuhyISaa	Aww first of all that is soo cute.. it deff sounds like he likes u! he prob got really embarrassed when those ppl in class called him on his flirting lol.. i think you should show some more signs t hat you are interested as well.. maybe catch his eye in class or try to have ur friends sit near him.. but trust me dont tell ur friends that u like him cause they will make ur life miserable.. ( teasin you infront of him) lol|`|TCpWVW4Raa	Well it sounds like he deffo likes you, it's just a simple way of flirting what he was doing.

Guys tease girls to get their attention...thats the best way to tell if a guy likes you; how much he teases you! It's good that you just have a few classes together, cuz you don't always want to be available. Just be careful how much you start liking him...you don't wanna end up crushed by your crush. But, from your story it sounds like he is embarrassed, shy, but likes you. You have to make the first move...talk to him more in class. Hang out at lunch and after school or do your bio homework.|`|kio95WBWaa	Well I think it's great that you like him and that he's showing signs that he likes you back. You should try talking to him more so that way you can eventually be better friends and start hanging out, but don't let him think you aren't interested in him. Be flirty with him, and if he gets embarrassed when his friends say he failed flirting it's fine because at least he tried! Just try getting closer with him and then when you feel it's right let him know that you like him and hopefully he likes you back, and if not there are many fish in the sea. :) Hope this helps!|`|v3bhi62Kaa	Ohh yeah he completely likes you! Guys do that to me all the time but not ever a whistle hhaha its just a flirting tactic. He likes you try to make a move like invite him out or give him a glance or when you guys are talking touch him a little bit ya know like a tap or something guys like that Don't seem to eager be laid back and you'll see things will work out. But it really seems like he likes you just got shy that people were making fun of him. BEST OF LUCK

J5zj8dWRaa	Very smart Dad:<br>  <br>  First things first - Do you sufficient money to move out?  Have you come up with a budget?  How will you live?  Figure out what bills you'll have (utilities, rent, transportation, health care, food, etc). How will you pay those bills without going bankrupt?  You say you want to be a nurse - are you in school, then (student loans, books, tuition, etc)?  Will you have a job?

If so, stay home until your education is complete. Once you become a nurse, you will be able to find and afford somewhere to live.|`|AA12041870	What are you searching for?  An apartment, a school, a job, what?  More information is needed here.  If you want information about being a nurse, contact my sister.  ldzurec@kent.edu.  She is the Dean of Nursing at Kent State University.  She has been a teacher for many, many years.  She is an RN and can guide you.

6eQXBGXVaa	All she needed was exactly what you did, you let her know she is not the only wonderful thing in this world. Now that she knows this it is best to keep her guessing for just a little while to seal the deal, if she didn't really care about yo,u she would have been relieved you ignored her, woman want to be loved but we also like a challenge. She now sees you as confident and strong, 2 things a woman falls in love with. Don't play games, but don't let her know how much you love her either, before you know it she will be asking you if you love her and how much..Call her back but not immediately, text her back but wait half hour, show her you are busy too. Good luck|`|YbwDFvEaaa	If you really love her and feel the relationship has marriage potential, you need to stop playing the childish cat-and-mouse games and just be with her. Tell her that you want to have a serious, long-term relationship with her, that you love her, that you don't want to lose her again. <br>  <br>  A relationship based on a game is usually treated like a game by one or both people involved. As soon as the game gets old, the relationship is over. If she doesn't want to be in a relationship with you based on honesty and just being who you both are, then it's hardly worth the effort.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|MdZybttZaa	First off is to look like you are indeed happy that she's tooken the choice of going back with you. Sho her some of the things she missed. Like "yeah while we were apart I'm much more into this and that..." catch her up. Also give her something new, something she can look forward to.|`|MRUVo6tnaa	Whatever led to the break up, it needs to be worked out.<br>  <br>  You will have to avoid that the same mistakes happen again. So frank and honest talking, with respect and love for each other, that you both seem to have  a lot still should help|`|AA12148387	You both need to stop playing games. If you love her and she loves you don't ignore each other. Work hard to not to do the things that caused the first break up. Respect each other.|`|GFiKQIGpaa	don't b stupid
1QT3dINMaa	It really just takes time and maturity. You gotta not care enough. You gotta know you gotta do what you gotta do regardless of what other people think. Hey you may even LOVE the fact that your dad, the taxi driver, is driving you to school pretty soon!|`|8Z8Ea2VUaa	Who cares if your dad is a taxi driver? That is a respectable job that requires a lot of work and pain in the *** passengers. I love taxi drivers. Tell your dad thanks for all the hard work he does to support you and your family.|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	Ride the bus you ungrateful brat.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Honey, how do you think this makes your dad feel?  That his own child is embarassed of him?  F what everyone else thinks!  Your dad is paying his own way for his family...he has a job in this horrible economy.  Stand up for yourself and your dad.  Get out of the damn cab right in front of everyone.  And if someone has something to say, then stand up for him.|`|GeyFdO5jaa	That's sad you feel that way-at least your dad has a job and is supporting his family.
ov8z9aOqaa	The definition of intercourse is to have sex or make love to somebody. When you say intercourse sex it literally means the same thing.|`|AA12205301	Intercourse is actually penetrating sex. Penis into vagina.  Oral sex is mouth to genital sex. Yes oral sex is considered sex.|`|PyxXp8tNaa	sexual intercourse: the act of sexual procreation between a man and a woman; the man's penis is inserted into the woman's vagina and excited until orgasm and ejaculation occur
OBCvewW2aa	A father, or 'father figure' is over rated.  There's nothing you can't teach your son that only a man can.  <br>  <br>  I'll spare you the lecture for getting with a man who doesn't take care of his children.  You know what they say, "if he does his own blood like that, imagine how he'll do you."<br>  <br>  Give him the papers and gear up for (truly) single motherhood.  It's not as bad as you think.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	This is for your son more than you. Not seeing this is going to be better for his development than seeing it. Give him the papers and get him out now.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Good reason not to have children with a man who abandoned his previous children.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I won't kick you in the butt....BUT! Your son really doesn't need to be brought up with a father figure of that character.  He spends no time with your son. Well, it's better to be gone and not spend time with him than to be there and not spend time with him; do you know what I mean? You don't want your son influenced by his behavior which does happen...kids are like sponges and they do emulate their parent's behavior a lot of the time. <br>  If you have gone to the trouble of getting the papers and feel the way that you do, you already know the right thing to do. Things are going to remain the same or only get worse if you don't make a major change.<br>  I wish you the best.<br>  Diane|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	The behavior your husband is showing your son will harm him... think about your son, he deserves better and if you think that no one will ever want a single mom, think again.<br>  <br>  I'm tall, beautiful, and have a great job. My ex broke up with me and seven months later he was engaged to a short, fat, ugly, hepatitis C infested, self proclaimed b*tch, unemployed waitress, single mother from a one night stand. If she can get my ex, you can find a man too.|`|xHxi9p0Vaa	You don't need a kick in the butt. But I will give you my opinion. Just do it and get it over with. Also, don't concern yourself with facilitating a father/son relationship between the two of them, that is his job, not yours. You should concentrate on fixing your life and improving it for the benefit of yourself, and your son. Do it. Do it now.|`|WrlD4xn6aa	If you still love him and really wants to be with him, get counseling.<br>  if not give him the paper. after all you are doing what;s best for both you and your son. no need for your son to see he;s dad drinking all the time at such a young age|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	For your child's sake give him the papers and kick him out.  Now, bend over and swing your leg backwards quickly.  Consider your self butt kicked.|`|VxC09hX5aa	On one hand you say he drinks when he's alone with your son and on the other you say he never spends time with him.<br>  <br>  So which one is it?|`|ivsYJPx3aa	Baby , Am I gonna have to come down there and tie ya all up?mmmmmmmuuuuuuuuuuuuucccccch|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Do it.  What kind of relationship does your son have with his father now?  If Dad is drinking when he's alone with him, it sounds like your son would be better off (safer) without him.  I divorced my ex and have 3 children for much the same reasons you did (plus, my ex abused me).  It got to the point my kids were asking why I just did not divorce their father.  The good news is - at least in my situation - the divorce caused my ex to really take a look at his like.  He is now clean & sober - too late for us - but not too late for him to be a better father.  Good luck to you.|`|yQfaj7c2aa	Hey-<br>  <br>  Sorry about your situation, I have to say that I agree with everyone else, kick this guy to the curb! You can and will do so much better for both you and for your son. He is setting a really poor example for your son. At some point you need to ask yourself if having him around is doing more damage than he would do if he wasn't. By not spending time with your son he is expressing to him how unimportant he is, and you are right- father's are critically important in the lives of their children, your boy is learning how to be a man by watching his dad. But as another person said, you aren't responsible for their relationship and at this point having him around is doing more harm than good...your son sees his dad, wants his dad's attention, likely tries to get it (through both positive and negative means) and likely the only attention he receives from his dad is the negative -not a good self-esteem builder. Aside from your son, what about you, and your needs? This man married you and has failed you in every sense of the word. Do not worry about his feelings when he gets the papers, did he worry when he helped to ruin your credit through foreclosure? Trust me, you will be a much happier woman in the long run and believe it or not, your son may too!  Best of luck to you and your precious son!|`|bzQNHfunaa	ok, been there done that! face it honey! ur son HAS NO FATHER!!! he has a guy who conviently watches ur son and doesnt even do a good job so im hearing!!! really i think you should just buck up...give him the papers and see what happens. or maybe you could sit downa dn discuss this with him. tell him that u are seriously considering him leaving and if he doesnt get AND MAINTAIN a job then he's out on his tookus! period!|`|MPt2GLI7aa	I understand. Its a huge step to take! The longer you hold out the harder it will be on your child. If he's not a good dad to the other kids, then nothing will make him change for this child....sorry, but its true.<br>  <br>  Get out while your child is still young! He would rather be from a broken home, than live in one....|`|vvre3CUuaa	Sometimes we have to kick our significant other in the *** to get them to see what they are doing to us. Sounds like this is one of those times. It is not easy, but it may wake his lazy *** up to what is going on with the marriage|`|lnd249Lsaa	Yep.......you have now been kicked. You know what you need to do already. You dont need our help.|`|jUS9ATdMaa	kick kick kick- have him leave now you and your son deserves better.|`|57IDs4byaa	Sorry to hear about your difficulties. Maybe my experience will help you out. <br>  I am also going through a rough spot in my marriage. My wife had an affair a little over a week ago and came out with it. After all of the dust had settled I found out that my drinking, lack of attention and not spending enough family time with her and our son were the reasons. For me, I didn't realize how I was affecting my wife and how alone she felt. I had to take a hard look at life and realize how much I love my wife and son and that I wasn't going to loose them. <br>  <br>  Does he know about his issues? I don't believe that divorce is the answer and I think that maybe with a marriage councilor you will be able to break through. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped in some way|`|AUxCv1hdaa	You already know what you need to do.  Do it.  His behaviors don’t sound like they are any good for you or your son.  You say you are scared your son will not see him..if he drinks around your son that may not be safe anyway.  If your husband still wants to see him, he will.  You can not force him to be a father.  Right now he is a burden on you and your son.  You need to take care of you and you son.  You have one child not two.  Kick his butt to the curb!  You will find someone else in due time.|`|mRevWUxlaa	Hate to say it sweetheart, he isnt going to be there for his son ..... and why would you waant that negative influence around your dear boy anyways? Do you want your son to grow up just like him? Stop thinking about you and your so-called-significant-other and start looking at what is most important!!!! Your son. His future depends on your strength and decisions that you make. Show your child that you're putting him first, always!!!! Please take my advice. My ex wasnt a drinker..... he torchered and killed animals as a means if relieving frustration. Im in Nevada now married to a wonderful man who works and makes excellent money and cares for me and my 3 children as if they were his own. My ex in in Florida still unemployed and over 20 grand in the hole owed in Child Support. There can be a happy ending... it's up to you!!!! Good Luck!!!!<br>  P.S. Why are you leaving your son with him if he drinks? That could be catagorized in the eyes of the law as Neglect. Check into it. Get out and move on. He hasnt changed after..... However many children he has produced.... he isnt going to start now. And if he does, It will be for him and nobody else.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	consider yourself kicked!|`|u7f0QB37aa	Is there a chance you have driven him to drink<br>  If so try not to do those things that set him off.<br>  <br>  Would you ever consider cheating on him with a man who owns a profitable business?
Whd6tqLzaa	You can't. In a relationship, both partner should have respect for each other.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	You simply don't stay in on of those. You run, as fast as you can ! When there is no more respect or if there is abuse involved, what's the point of staying ?|`|IvMPh09baa	ok.  you don't stay in this relationship.  and if you do, whats the point?  <br>  <br>  if your staying in it fully well knowing how bad it is, why are you complaining?  your staying in it for a reason... right?  <br>  <br>  if your not giving to your relationship... then your taking from it. all take and not give... well thats not a relationship then.|`|wpi36XBAaa	The better question would be "WHY stay in a relationship that is full of stress and disrespect on both parts?".<br>  Unless you are BOTH willing to get some help, to work on improving this relationship, both willing to get it back on track, both willing to make the personal changes necessary, then it can't work long term. You will just end up tearing each other apart, breaking each other down til there is no alternative left but to leave. <br>  So if you aren't both willing to fix it - end it.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	I lived that life too and I divorced, but when I remarried I found that it was difficult to not consider everything that might happen as a reason to split.  When you divorce the first time it really does tear you apart and it's harder after that to remain with anyone new.  I finally went to out church counselors and we took a course on marriage and discovered all sorts of wonderful things about ourselves and our marriage and we work on it everyday.  It truly was a life and marriage saver|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Me personally?  I don't stay in it.  I haven't stayed in it.  My marriage was full of stress and money problems (no porn problem though) but why would you want to stay in that?  I moved on 6 years ago and have found someone far more suitable to me.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Girl, what are you doing?  Are you married to this guy?  If not, leave.  Especially if you are becoming sexually insecure because of his porno addiction.  Pornography is replacing you in the bedroom and everytime he closes his eyes, it is not you he is with and you know it.  That is why you can't perform sexually.  He and the situation is stealing your soul, your health and your frame of mind.  Go and find yourself, again.  Believe in yourself, again.  Regain your self confidence, again.  That is what this relationship has taken from you.  I feel so bad for you, honey.  Don't waste any more of your life on beating a dead horse.  God bless you and I will be praying for you.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Don't go making major relationship decisions when you are about to drop baby.  You are too pregnant and witch to keep dwelling on this stuff...focus on the upcoming birth and deal with the relationship fallout later.|`|LsFUniCSaa	If he doesn't change honey, it may be time to move on to greener pastures.

That's for him to fix...|`|F8iYNurEaa	Does he behave like this with your children??? If not, and he's sorry for what he did and you still love him, then you have to try and find a way to forgive him. Of course, I don't know what he did to his other children so i suppose it also depends on the level of abuse he inflicted upon them. Only you can make this judgement.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	umm..i would be so freaking horrified. if i had kids with him, i would watch him with them VERY closely. as soon as i noticed anything strange or abuse, i would call child protective services AND divorce.  kids are the most precisous and innocence human, so to abuse them is so evil that it makes me ill just to think about it.|`|c2da9d6744cd0c23d5d0b9b9300338a7aa	Boot camp is not abuse. The kids are probably more screwed up by him not being in their lives more. Pay attention to the now.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	You need to talk to him about how you feel.  Do you two have children together?  Is he or was he an alcoholic?  Did he have something going on in his life with those children that may have pushed him to punish them too severely?  Talk to him.  Counseling may also help especially if you fear he may treat your children the same way.  In any event, this has to be ironed out otherwise it will continue to eat at you and you will lose respect for him.|`|qsLhVZd8aa	Nothing wrong with military boot camp.

mx3gFmIKaa	Yes.  We went to Aruba.  I haven't been many places, but my husband has, he said its much better than Ireland, Hawaii, Bermuda, Orlando Fla. and other places.<br>  <br>  You can't get lost.  Everybody speaks English.  There is no litter anywhere.  You can take a bus into town if your hotel is not in town.  This costs 1.50 round trip.   We paid very little for taxis. They take dollars, no money exchange.<br>  <br>  Its very romantic.  Sunset catamaran cruises, you can do a day trip to venezuela, the casinos are tops, seafood is unbelieveable and totally reasonable, dinner in a lighthouse restaurant, horseback riding on the beach, off road trips in jeeps, beaches,  great shopping.<br>  <br>  When we were there royalty was there.  Dutch royal couple Prince Willem Alexander.  <br>  No rain at all, consierge check in is outside, weather is consistant, no rodents ect, there are small green lizards called Iguanas but they are very skittish and run away<br>  <br>  We ate the best blackened mahi mahi at Iguana Joe's<br>  I heard Carlos and Charlies closed but that was good too<br>  Arinok national park is beautiful<br>  The royal plaza mall is in the center of town Oranjested<br>  The natural pond is really neat, we went swimming in it with the fish, take an underwater camera<br>  The natural bridge makes pretty pictures<br>  There is cactus and palm trees and the divi tree that grows crooked<br>  Sea breeze cafe 9.95 sunset dinner with a free glass of house wine<br>  The kukoo Kunuku bar hopping bus tour<br>  <br>  I would live in Aruba its great|`|pKzH1cFHaa	I went to Aruba with my family and my parents went there for their honeymoon.

There are risk everywhere in the world, but Aruba is considered safe.<br>  <br>  Don't judge it based on the ONE, highly publicized, case of Natalie Holloway.(who wasn't killed, she was sold into the sex-slave business...it's not much better but people need to get their facts straight)<br>  I mean Paul Bernardo murdered 2 people (and raped at least 2 others) about 5 minutes from where I live but St. Catharines is still considered a very safe city.<br>  You can't judge based on that.  Something bad has happened everywhere<br>  My point: Aruba is safe and gorgeous and a perfect place for your honeymoon.|`|kc68BXwTaa	There are risks. <br>  <br>  Beyond that one case, crime by locals against tourists is completely unheard of (The prime suspect was another tourist).<br>  <br>  Also, it's part of the Dutch Antilles islands, which have about a 2% chance of getting hit with a hurricane.|`|9hPnvmuzaa	Of course! It's also very beautiful and could be very romantic!<br>  <br>  enjoy!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I'm sure it's a good place. Don't judge a place just because of what happened. There are good and bad people/places EVERYWHERE.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|ACecbVghaa	If they ever find Natalee Holloway you could ask her... There are risks no matter where you go. Just travel smart and safe and you'll be fine.
e52cc83463d91acf91b6b61881b4f14baa	I can see your dilema.  But this guy seems as though he might be at least worth having as a friend.  And even though he did the "drunk call", he did ask about your aunt during that time, so on some level, he was thinking about you.  Calling someone early in the morning just to tell them to have a nice day is really sweet too.  Yes, his break-up is fresh, but he does seem to like you.  If you give him a chance, perhaps you can win his heart.  Best wishes to you.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	He may seem like a nice guy but I wouldn't be touching this one with a ten foot pole.  A month break-up is fresh. There is NO way around that. And he sounds like he's got a drinking problem.  Do you want that combo in your life right now?

Talk with him to see where his heart is at and see how serious he think the relationship is you don't want to make a fool out of yourself.  If he feels the same way tell him.|`|YV1bOajXaa	Are you afraid he does not feel the same way - what would be holding you back.  Tell him that you love spending time with him and that you love him.|`|13a87592d282ebeb271d1b3129180295aa	Don't.

Two months might seem a little premature to some, but not others.  A guy might not be ready to handle that type of sentiment. While others might fall inlove jsut as fast. <br>  Really try to guage his response before you say anything as you could easily face rejection.<br>  On the other hand when I once told a man that I loved him it was completely by accident and caught us both by surprise. He did not reciprocate the same feelings at that time and i never spoke those words again. At least not until he felt the same and was ready to say it to me.  <br>  If you are really feeling love for him and you are ready to say it, JUST SAY IT!  <br>  Best wishes to you!|`|z4c7zGKmaa	I was always told not not be the first to say I love you unless you are either 100% certain that you will hear it back or you will be 100% OK with it if you don't hear it back.<br>  <br>  Although I know I love my bf (of almost a year!) and I'm pretty sure he loves me too, I haven't yet said it because I'm not sure of either scenario I mentioned above.|`|acafdcce761f87a23b935269eb5f71f2aa	Two months is not very long.  <br>  <br>  My rule is never to say it first.

I think you wouldn't scare him off if you tell him that way. Telling him you love him out bluntly sounds scary and might push him away, and he and you might feel awkward if he doesn't feel the same way.|`|lnHKsijqaa	1. Decide on a place where you will tell him that you love him. Think about a certain memory that is especially romantic to you, and go back to that place. Ask yourself if there are any significant days coming up when it would be appropriate and romantic to tell him.<br>  2. Set the mood. There’s no need to make sure every little detail is perfect. Be sure that you don’t lose sight of your romantic tone in all the commotion of worrying how you will tell him.<br>  3. Get his attention. Look your boyfriend directly in the eyes, hold his hand and face him completely.<br>  4. Tell him exactly what you enjoy about him, why you are happy being with him or how much you appreciate him. Let him know how lucky you feel to have him.<br>  5. Say “I love you” after these statements. If you are still nervous about just saying those three words, make your sentence longer. For example, say something like “I realize I love you.” Once you have said “I love you,” tell him as many times as you can just how much you do love him. <br>  <br>  Please answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090223134305AAJFvNJ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|OctCtbsOaa	You might very well love him already, but that doesn't mean you're ready to say it.

dFHsAXDMaa	Ok first as a parent I would never want any of my kids to run away if they were in trouble I would want them to tell me so we can get through it together. There is no problem too big to solve if you are honest about it.. the ones you can not solve are the ones you run away from thinking yu can avoid them... so talk to your parents let them help yu get through this maybe they will choose to send you to your grandparents or other family to keep you safe. talk to them|`|BNAzjSO1aa	Sorry I do not understand the ranked in eastside part. But what do you think your running away will do to your parents? Having to face each day not knowing where you are or if you are safe or even alive? Stay with them and work out your problems nothing is ever solved by running away. If you do run away where will you get money for food and clothes etc Be a man and stay and solve your problems|`|sCr2iTczaa	Tell her exactly what you just said... you never know she may let you stay. Look i know if i had a friend or bf in need they would always be welcome in my house.|`|gqvvXknQaa	Don't run away.<br>  <br>  Be a man, face and conquer your problems. They will only follow you in the end.|`|sCCjAKllaa	Tell her you need a place to stay because difficult times are here. If not, then don't run away.|`|qfAQXYKIaa	Just tell her the situation...if shes a real woman she'll be there for you|`|2hLMsZueaa	tell her the truth being honest is the best thing you can do|`|0qW0rWlSaa	i dont understand, you got ranked into eastside? wtf is that lol|`|YSAfYkPwaa	Running away and posting this online makes you a *****.<br>  <br>  Your not a man.
aM2JDDWgaa	well i'd watch for signs, talk to her more OFF OF TEXTING lol and see if she starts to act more like herself around you... she sounds like she could like you but then again it could always be that she's just shy around new people and doesn't feel comfortable enough around you yet to act like she does with her friends. just be yourself and have fun. oh and if she laughs at stupid jokes and you catch her staring at you then she probably does like you :]|`|wkJ8E4qEaa	its a difficult situation, i think you should wait, dont act to soon an ruin any chance you might have, try spending more time with her, this will help you findout about her feelings.|`|L1LRQMwWaa	Aw you sound like a sweetie (:<br>  Ahhhh, girls are confusing thangs'.

The worst that can happen is she says she just wants to be friends, so you win either way by maybe getting a girlfriend or at least a good friend that is a girl.|`|AXmDf9WTaa	i think she does like you :) i mean if she's texting you a lot thats definitely a sign and maybe she's a little shy or quiet with you because she feels the same.<br>  <br>  flirt with her a little, if a cute way and see how she responds and just take it from there.<br>  <br>  good luck! xx|`|gbENH62jaa	I don't think this is funny, I think its cute! Well if you want to know if she likes you, you could try asking her friends what she thinks about you. Or maybe you could drop a few hints that you like her and she might pick 'em up and tell you that shes got feelings for you. If you are a little nervous to try approaching her directly, you could ask her what she thinks about you in a text message. It's a lot easier when you type it then talking to her face-to-face. I hope this helps!!|`|wh3EJtZeaa	Awe that's nice :)<br>  Well I think the fact you txt each other a lot is a good start, as long as it's equal & not always you that texts her first. <br>  I suppose eye contact is the biggest giveaway. Say if your with a group of friends, & yours & her eyes meet, does she look down shyly then look back up at you, & hold your gaze a bit longer than normal? But she could be a bit shy (even "stunners" get shy lol) so is more confident when her friends are around.<br>  I would suggest next time you see or txt her, give her some kind of compliment, & see how she reacts. Good luck xX|`|HacAnoDHaa	sounds she likes you but a little shy<br>  maybe she's confused too and doesn't want to step up like you so she is trying to avoid awkward situations with you in case she thinks you don't like her when she really likes you<br>  try it no harm in doing so if she says no then it wasn't meant to be but if she says yes then its a plus <br>  hope this helps :)<br>  pretty good answer for a young teen hey? :)|`|n6NthDxwaa	Why is it so hard to simply ask???

In my opinion this girl likes you, did you ever think that maybe she is mega nervous when you talk to her or are around. Maybe shes rally nervous because she likes you a lot. Shes texting you a lot that is definitely a sign she likes. You get along with her friends your definably in because that is a girls foundation her friend. I say invite her out on a date or something maybe just the two of you or maybe with her friends so it is more laid back less pressure. Im thinking to the movies out to dinner or a coffee something really casual. BEST OF LUCK|`|8Cnqdn62aa	Well You can either: just come out and just ask her how she feels,<br>  or Just tell her how you feel,<br>  or do the childish thing and tell her your situation without using her name and see what she says. (this is cute and will make her smile and laugh in a good way)|`|w2ppi6ulaa	Well my advice as a girl would be to just ask her out on a date.

I hope everything works out! :)|`|BpIusOA3aa	It dosent matter, just ask her out! then you'll find out! find out!

And they will stay that way until he and only he decides when it's time to stop.  That usually happens when he has hit rock bottom and ends up in a hospital for an overdose or gets arrested.  Sometimes both.  My advice to you?  Move on.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Honey, why are you with him still? He is making your life a living hell. Get rid of him. He only cares about getting high.|`|IvMPh09baa	usually pot doesn't make you agressive, it does the opposite.  i really think it was the speed that he was on making him agressive.<br>  <br>  it doesn't matter how selfish you think he is being, what I am more concerned with here is the fact that you are completely ignoring his drug problem... seriously... he said that he wants to do drugs... understand theres something very wrong with that.  If you are in a relationship with anyone that WANTS to do drugs.. then understand you are being warned right now.  you come second to drugs, as you are already experiencing.. he cares about drugs, not you.  <br>  <br>  i suggest you run from this relationship, one of two things are going to happen.  one would be the agression and arguments continue, and if he's on drugs... then his agression will get worse and violence is likely to happen.<br>  <br>  or else, you being around him and drugs all the time is going to cause a chaotic environment.  do you think its healthy for you to be involved with a drug user?  come on.  i hope you have a better head on your shoulders.  no matter how much you love him... he's using drugs.  thats a big no no.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	Run as far away and as quickly as you can.  If it's bad now, it's only going to get worse as his drug abuse escalates.  There is nothing you can do; he is a big boy and has made his choice.  Now you must make yours.

Expecting him to stop being a jerk and a doper could be seen as controlling. Either take his crap (not) or wake up. This is no way to care about another. He clearly is too immature to have a relationship.|`|34b40Vu3aa	I think you are unreasonable for even thinking of marrying this guy.  Is this what you want the rest of your life to be like?

Especially with his drug habit.|`|wpi36XBAaa	What does it all mean? It means that his priority lies with the drugs and hanging with his mates like some teenage kid. He wants to bum around, acting juvenile. He made his choice, by not putting you or your relationship at the top of his list. <br>  Its not controlling to want to be engaged to an adult, and to expect him to act that way. It's not controlling to want to spend time with your partner. <br>  And he gets aggressive and intimidating when he's not got his supply/had his "fix"? That sounds like he's an addict. Has he used in the past? Then its got him good, chances are he's hooked.<br>  Now you have to decide if you want that in your life. Give him the choice - this "lifestyle" of always going out with his mates and the drugs, or you. Tell him he can't have both. If he gives it up, fine, but make sure he gets help to stay clean and sober. If not, you will have to end it with him.|`|wfMC742Naa	Leave him before he can hurt you anymore.  It sounds like he doesn't want to straighten out his life, and you don't come first.  The chances of him changing are slim.

Drop him & find someone that is not wasting their life on drugs and alcohol.|`|PiczCyjbaa	Ok so I'm not in the exact situation but I know my husband uses - and does *eh hem* other things with pot/weed. Even though people say that weed isn't a big deal I think that it does effect a person's judgment and behavior significantly after long-term use. He claims he's not addicted but he gets rather crazy when he hasn't had it for a while and as you said about your fiance, my husband gets aggressive with me when he's high and has even knocked me over the couch because I wouldn't tell him who I was on the phone with.<br>  <br>  You are not being unreasonable in wanting him to stop. BUT, you may be unreasonable in thinking that the relationship is going to work. If he's addicted now, he probably will be for a while. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life dealing with that and not having the option to be with ANY other man but a drug addict for the rest of you life. PROBABLY NOT! My advice is to get out now. If he ever gets himself together and you feel that you still want him, then maybe you can take him back - if you're that madly in love with him.<br>  <br>  Edit: I noticed someone above me said that you should talk to him and tell him that he should stop if he wants to be with you MAYBE. I did that with my husband before we got married and he did stop - until we got married. Then he was back at it again. So, be cautious about him "telling" you he will stop and even if he does stop....|`|kyqhMuSiaa	How long have you been together? I'm thinking that he's done all this stuff before and you just happened to meet him when he was sober. Being back wtih his mates in that environment has brought it all out again. You need to sit down with him, have a conversation, no yelling or anything, and tell him that if you are going to be together and get married that you don't want this to ba apart of your life. If he truly loves you he will find a way to stop doing it again. If not you have to stick to your guns and leave. NEVER let a guy put drugs before you.

ebfb6f74ff2342b199ea5099662b442eaa	Well, it is illegal (except in Nevada, under certain medical & legal rules), is dangerous, can be unhealthy And often is, and no way to respect yourself or your customer. Sex w/ out any emotional involvement is like coffee w/ no color, no sugar...or cigarettes w/out nicotine, tobacco, or smoke...in other words, isn't real. How can it effect you???? Syph, AIDS, violence, strings of weirdos, distancing from others, emotional miscues and screw ups. Think this through again. Be good to yourself. In the words of the song: "love is the answer!" And hard work, and self-respect.|`|nJ0MRH24aa	This is a poor forum to get decent answers on a question like this. Folks here love to answer, but are largely ignorant about the subject.<br>  <br>  1) As far as I know, it is legal to pay for sex, and also, to receive money for it. What is illegal to to pander (the sales part) it. Otherwise, I suspect that the wives of our politicians would belong in prison for having sex with their husbands for money.<br>  <br>  2) I suggest you ask some real prostitutes about the situation.<br>  <br>  3) There are many types of prostitutes. The experiences are really different depending on the approach.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|wy5SiCS2aa	well prostitutes usually end up on drugs, and with all kinds of diseases, plus you have to have sex with anyone willing to pay you, like some old 50 year old fat guy who's smelly, do you really want to put your mouth places on a guy like that? If you're being paid you have to, and you have to pretend you like it. Doesn't seem like a glamourous life to me.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Prostitutes regularly get STD's. It's not uncommon for a client to become unruly either. Getting beaten is common. Self respect is just not something you'd need to worry about. You wouldn't have any. Find someone you can have a long lasting quality relationship with and have all the sex you want. Just have a life with it.|`|AA10690306	That is a moral quagmire.  But let me ask you this.  Why, if it is so bad is it the oldest recorded profession?  <br>  <br>  And here is another along the same lines.  Are not all men who marry just buying a long term companion?   30 years ago I would have said that was ridiculous but after 2 divorces where the ONLY important thing was the money my ex's could get from me, I now have to seriously ask!|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	A prostitute is a dirty sleazy woman who has no self respect. You might as well become a porn star but not all women are pretty enough so you could resort to an escort or be a stripper if that is what u really want out of life. You will become dirty and could get diseases. You would regret it.|`|AtJXqxN2aa	well yea it is because it should b ur last resort for money if u really need money but still i will never do that i would sell a kidney than use my body to make money.when u sell ur body doesnt that make u feel like trash? its like having a bf that only wants u because ur able to please him, then he treats u like crap.u dont know anyone ur sleeping with so they could b loaded with stds and u wont even know it and u could die or be kidnapped if ur doing it in the guy's car and he could really hurt you.PROSTITUTION IS JUST STUPID!!!|`|Whd6tqLzaa	It depends on how you look at life.

(income taxes) just spend the cash, and have fun.|`|mldo1vxYaa	Fun?? Lets see, you have men using you like a piece of meat, the risk of being beat up, raped or even killed oh and its illegal. Prostitution is not like having sex with a partner you love. It would be with people you dont care about, dont know, you dont know their sexual history, they could have an std or even aids. This should be common sense.|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	You get into dangerous situations you will get treated in ways that make you feel disgusted with yourself and with men, overtime it will weigh on you it will hurt your heart your mind and it will make you lose trust and respect for people and the money will never seem like enough. The bad days will far outweigh anything good.|`|1ZnzjCdlaa	it is not the greatest thing in the world. you dont know these people. you dont know what they have. yeah in a real world getting paid to have sex would be great. everybody would do that then, but you should find someone that cares and loves you. only have sex with that person. it is better that way then having sex with some ole stranger and getting a disease because of them. i love having sex with my guy. i would not want to have sex with someone i didnt know.|`|f4RnGIeSaa	Being a prostitute isn't actually bad.  It is illegal because it can spread disease and such, but if monitored and done correctly is as safe as picking up someone in a bar.<br>  <br>  It is illegal also because the US is stuck on what everyone considers "Christian values".|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Prostitution is a sad situation, I pity those women, they are peoples daughters/sisters/mothers, they should have a better quality of life, they aren't bad people underneath it all.

Short of the obvious killing, cheating, maiming, stealing, etc. taboos, Sex and drugs are personal choices unfortunately not recognized by our misguided legal system.<br>  As a prostitute the range of clients will range from just plain normal, lonely people for whom prostitution would be a therapeutic service to those who feel they need to pay to be able to live out their sexual fantasies. Not always fun stuff depending on your sensitivities.<br>  There have been many books written by those engaged in the trade and as with any business there are a variety of branches one could enter into. It seems to me that the high end, statespeople and dignitaries, would be the way to go. They are definitely out there wanting discrete service and are more than willing to pay the  big bucks.<br>  Never mind the $ 20. on the way to work bj. Weather's not always good to be standing on a street corner.<br>  Go for the guys who'll put you up in fancy digs and buy you expensive clothes and provide the 6 digit income without the pimps and do protect yourself from std's as best you can. They're bad for business.|`|MYPMoVg4aa	I can't say i've ever been through the experience of prositution but my bestfriend became one when she moved to greece last year,<br>  a man ended up physically abusing her, causing her to land in hospital.<br>  They can be dangerous and there's a lot of risks. Family and friends probably wouldn't think a lot of you either but then again there are prostitutes who love what they do, they get money for having sex which sounds pretty good, just consider the risks and aslong as it seems safe then go for it. just be very careful.|`|L2Oct8GBaa	picture yourself having sex with fat men, skinny men, ugly men, stinky men and in positions you don't want to be in. They want you to have intercourse using your vagina, your anus, your mouth, could you do this? It can emotionally scar your forever and who wants to marry a prostitute? If your intelligent enough to ask this question than i think you can figure out if its really bad or not.|`|HzfbVdY3aa	Do you really not mind being a whore?<br>  Prostitutes don't get paid well, not successful, and you could do something else more useful in life. <br>  You're not an animal; you're a human.<br>  Don't you want to maybe get married or at least be able to afford a car?<br>  You really want to waste your life just having sex and not being able to support your family, better yet, yourself?<br>  Living with the fact that you're useless and you're spending many years giving yourself away to someone you don't give a s*** about?<br>  Really, you might as well commit suicide if your only reason to live life is to go around having sex with nasty men.<br>  And there's many risks. There's a lot of STDs you can get.<br>  How are you gong to be able to live when you're 60? you have no money, no husband to have sex with, no kids, nothing except alot of experience and you will die lonely and used.|`|AA12107843	The reason that prostitution is illegal is because of the profound effects it can have on your body, your self esteem, your safety, and our society.  <br>  <br>  Your body can get STD's.  You can get unintentionally pregnant.  You can desensitize yourself to the touches and feelings involved with sex so that you have problems later on when you try to enjoy it with someone you love and want to please.<br>  <br>  Your self esteem can be affected by what "johns" say to you, how they treat you, and how other people who know you are a prostitute treat you.  You could also be affected by the knowledge that God did not intend for our bodies to be shared with other people outside of marriage or commitment.  <br>  <br>  Your safety is at risk because of the illegality of the profession and the fact that you would be dealing in secret - with strangers - naked.  Enough said.<br>  <br>  Finally, society is damaged because money that people could put into legal businesses, charities, etc... gets funnelled to prostitutes via covert addiction and need for sex.  Because prostitution is illegal, most prostitutes do not pay taxes.  This means that they and thier pimps (if they have them) receive public services like police protection, 911 calls, etc.. for free; and are not contributing to the medicare and social security systems - so they are denying our elders the funding that they are currently entitled to by law.  Society is further damaged when other people learn of the prostitution that someone "makes work" for them, despite its illegality, and they themselves decide to take up the profession - or participate in funding it - etc..  <br>  <br>  I've only hit the tip of the iceberg - but I hope this opens your eyes to the many effects out there that your action would have.|`|Ugj6cJ1Oaa	I dont think it is bad. It is a choice to have sex, and I think that as long as everyone is careful, and you are tested for STD's frequently, then I think there is no problem. I think that if they government controlled prostitution it would be safer because everyone would be tested, and it could be regulated.|`|OctCtbsOaa	Everyone will have their opinions, but if you think it's for you... maybe you're right. <br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that you don't get to have sex with whomever you want... mostly you'll have to have it with people you find disgusting. (people who  couldn't get someone to sleep with them without paying) <br>  <br>  Also, even if you're okay with it... a lot of the people who pay for prostitutes think down on you.  You will be treated with disrespect and they will likely say horrible degrading things to you.|`|46bc66aae08bf5ff4cd8904a43ba146eaa	I think the prostitute part of the question is a Moral one, in which there is no right or wrong answer,<br>  <br>  As for the trade aspect, I think it is like being a bass fisherman for a living, <br>  <br>  It’s all great until the day, that you HAVE to go fishing when you are sick, hung-over etc. its bitter cold, raining and your favorite uncle just died, on that day, it becomes just another cruddy job like all the others<br>  <br>  <br>  Meanwhile here is a link that discusses the pro's and cons of protitution... Happy reading|`|AA11090238	Is this a serious question? I think you should consult a shrink.<br>  As far as how it can affect you...there are psychological effects, you could get an STD. What happens if you get pregnant? There have been so many cases of abusive "johns"...even cases of johns killing prostitutes. Once you get started, it's not an easy lifestyle to just get out of. But, if you have weighed all the risks and still decide to do this, then to each his own. You also don't want to end up in jail for prostitution.|`|gVyHUSYqaa	Yeah!  These men are desperate and will take out years of frustration out on you.  Meaning they could choke you, beat you, and just be completely careless about you.  They only care about themselves.  Same with pimps, they're heartless scumb bags that when it comes down to it.  Will kill you if you tried to stop prostituting.  On top of that who knows who has an STD.  Then once you try getting a legitmate job you'll have no work history, and your life is ruined.  DON"T BE A PROSTITUTE!|`|cU2uAytqaa	...what has the world come to?<br>  yes. being a  prost.itute          is bad. :( first of all, you're having     with strangers. second of all, you're giving yourself away for money. third of all, no one wants to marry a  h8ker     . fourth of all, there are numerous diseases you can get, the worst of which being a baby|`|qjy5OirNaa	hell no, people need prostitutes, it's cool<br>  is ur name julia|`|HY22vMOhaa	Prostitution is not bad.

But, since it is illegal every where else there are all sorts of evil that attaches, including pimps, drugs, and diseases.

I think its usually horny guys that are married with ugly wives or guys that cant get none so that is pretty nasty.

52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	I'm totally cool with that.  This is the modern day.

I couldn't ever imagine proposing to my husband when we were dating. I believe that when a guy is ready he will do it. However, I do have friends that have proposed. It works either way.

dFHsAXDMaa	I personally like it when a man is a man and just knows what I want. or explores and experiments until he figures it out.... exploring what makes the other person squirm is half the fun. <br>  <br>  I have this theory about sex... it is like the fireworks on the 4th of july... you fight all the traffic to get a parking place....the little fireworks at the beginning are kissing touching oral and the grand finale is intercourse and just like the 4th of july would suck fighting all that traffic for just the 5 minute grand finale so would sex.|`|mFAJG2E8aa	I like that!

Some woman are sexually strong and if they want something they go for it and are not ashamed for it. Others are scared and do something just because they are scared to say no. If you are doing things with guys because you want them to like you then yes your easy.. sorry. But if you do it because you want it then know you aren't easy you aren't giving it away. But for the guy I would demand a real explanation for what happened. Someone suggesting there is another girl is your business.|`|w2ppi6ulaa	Well its natural human instinct for girls to be curious about what their bfs do. Especially with the conversation you heard.

l7GjBVvhaa	Why would you think its impractical or impossible? If both parties enjoy each others company and sexually/romantically interested in one another than dating is normal. If you and this guy are having a healhty relationship then do not worry what other think.  You two are both adults and know what is best over all. Since you just started dating this guy don't let it bother you so much. Get to know him better and him you. Date, have fun, enjoy each other. If it gets serious enough then you can mention to your parents his age. If your parents ask you know if you are dating someone simply say yes. Don't give out the info if your not ready to with them. If you want them to know then tell them I am sure if you are the mature adult you are they will know you are making the choice because you want to. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you.....|`|5iOHJHUzaa	The main thing you need to do is ask yourself:<br>  <br>  Am I ready to take on the responsibilities/life of a 40 something year old. You already know he has kids, and they come first. Many of your dates might be "kid oriented". Are you OK with this? <br>  <br>  Try as he might, he cannot take on the life of a teenager. He has too many responsibilities. That means that you are going to have to step up to make this work. Can you do that?|`|na8ObA5Haa	HAHAHA Im 18, and my dad is 45! <br>  wow why not just date your daddy? <br>  same dang thing girlfriend. <br>  <br>  eww.<br>  think about it how i see it. your older and have a daughter who is 18 and she is dating a 50 year old divorced man with 2 kids... <br>  <br>  How would that make you feel?<br>  <br>  <br>  PUKE.|`|7eaf5c689c77b9c042b4be96ab16b8abaa	No, this is bad.

Does he want more kids? Can he have kids in 5 years/<br>  What is the relationships with his ex life?<br>  <br>  Honestly, I think the problem here is that you are young. Age isn't a huge issue, but if it means that you'll have to have kids early or forfeit your dreams to be with him, no.<br>  <br>  For now -  I would not anticipate the future and just enjoy your relationship now. Try holding off on sex for a month - get to know him as a person and see if your relationships grow. If the relationship flops, then you at least know why he was with you.|`|TxcpzRdRaa	I have had several friends in that situation and it didn't work.<br>  Especially because you are just 18, people's first reactions will be "Oh my God, what an old pervert." every time they see him with you. Because they will be thinking about the fact that last year, it would have been illegal for him to be with you. Do you want him to experience that?<br>  Also, for your own life are you ready to take on the responsibilities of children and a home and whatever else? As a college student myself, I know kids and a house and even a husband are a few years away, though I am in a serious relationship. By being with someone much older, you are giving up several of the more youthful experiences, like college, that you would otherwise have experienced.<br>  But it's up to you. Those are just my observations on friends that have gone through the same thing. In the end, if he's what you want, it's the right thing to do. Best of luck!|`|jgU4g6kGaa	Well you often hear people say age is only a number but how do you feel about this age difference?  Do you and him share anything in common?  I think it all depends on whether you are happy with the relationship.  Of coarse your parents may not understand cuz you are their daughter but in the end it's your choice.  Do what you feel is right and what makes you happy inside.|`|RIJDIeC6aa	Ummm I think that love has no age, I would personally not date anyone older than me by 10 years. My English teacher met her husband when she was in high school. They have like a 21 year difference and now they have 2 kids, she's 36 and he's like 60 something! Cheer up, and when you tell your parents find really really good news to tell them before you break it to them. Love has no age.|`|dHH4Rl2yaa	It may pose problems if you have kids with him.  He could pass away while the kids are young, and this would be really tough on them.  If he really truly loves you for who you are and not because of the fact that you're young and ripe, then I guess you have to go for it.  You can't fight love.  It usually just makes you miserable.|`|dFHsAXDMaa	my parents Mom and stepfather as 17 years apart in age.

Well, I will say right off the bat that I think it is a terrible idea.......27 years maybe feasible.... maybe, but that would be if you were 40 and he was 67... wow, that's hard to accept too, but anyway, here's my advise.<br>  Go to his ex. And sit down with her girl to girl and ask her why they broke up. You can learn alot through that means.<br>  Go to your most trusted friend, the gal who you can tell everything, ask her for some advise.<br>  Ask Allison why she is dating this guy, what need is she getting met by a man who is more like a father than a boyfriend. How does your Dad and your relationship with him tie into your desire for this 45 year old man?<br>  <br>  Allison, that's my best shot. Most importantly I would suggest you ask yourself what need your getting met in respect to your past relationship with Dad.<br>  Be careful out there, most guys like this are nice, but can be very dangerous in reality. Also ask yourself how you would be a bad affect on those little kids... suddenly your mommy?<br>  <br>  Food for thought : ).|`|I6Mma2duaa	Im 19 and in college and the highest age ive dated was 28 but 45 is kind of up there <br>  <br>  ive never been there so i cant rlly say if it will work out or not <br>  <br>  but just remember whenever someone is older then you they been there done that and way more experienced so don't be naive to believe he loves you like you love him<br>  <br>  to be honest for a 45 year old to be talking to an 18 year old they either want someone who they can manipulate and control and tell them anything or they just want someone who hasnt been half of the places they been <br>  <br>  tell your parents because they may say something you dont like but 8 out of 10 their always right|`|3yWAyps4aa	your far too young to get tied down with familly and even if you have the same ideas now this may all change in the future, i just think 27 years is too big of an age difference to make a commitment.

The only problem with this relationship is that he is a father of two children. Do you really think you are ready to be a mom of someone elses children at 18?

First if he is already 45 and have kids, then he probably has met his first love and will always love that person.  You will never compare to whoever is in his heart.  Second, with the age difference you two definitely will have different things to look forward to in life.  You are so young and have so many new things to experience, some you don't even know thats coming.  At his age he's experienced his youth and is just holding on to something to feel young again and not alone to his upcoming elder age.<br>  <br>  I'm not going to say it will not work out, but if you two have different outlooks to the future in life then you two ill probably be bound to lose each other.  I think if you were older and he was older with the same 27  year difference it may work out.  But you are still young and probably still don't know what you want because you have experienced enough yet.|`|mc0h9ATMaa	Hello, honestly like they say, age is nothing but a number. You being 18 still have a bit of "experience to gain". Dating is harmless. I think it's ok to date but don't commit to anything more serious until you truly know that you are compatible. You may look at it like " he has got it together and is financially stable" and he may look at it like " i have me a brand new model". You have to see if you will be able to make it past the comments people will make and also how your family will take it. I am 29 and my girl friend is going on 22 and I hear about it sometimes. Right now age is conflicting but later on it will even out. In your situation, think about it. When you are 30 he  will be almost 50. If I were in your situation I would wait until you fall in love and then break it down to everyone… hope it helps.  your situation|`|tCmsaZ8Zaa	i never been in a situation like that am 32 but, 18 and 45 is a lot of difference, and your parents are not going to be okay with it. my advice to you is get someone your age or max 5 years older then you. because have you ever think about that maybe he just want to be with you because your young, pretty and have a nice body and all he wants is have sex with  you and then leave you bacause your just to young and unmature! but am not your parents and at the final of the day is your decision and i hope you make the right one , good luck.|`|HMv6jvUCaa	You sound just like a friend of mine, I  almost thought she was you.<br>  <br>  My opinion like I told her was if it feels right do it and who care what people think.|`|Jf0s6pByaa	well go ahead guess but their will be some set back because of the age difference especially how people view you and maybe even the maturity level so be prepared|`|c815f0954f0cc607a22f3e49bfd31b48aa	It might seem strange sometimes but age is just a number once you're an adult. There will be times that the age difference causes problems though. When people think he's your dad, it might make him feel weird and when you want to do the things people your age normally do, he might be less than supportive since he's already been there and done that. Also, you're not really even old enough to be the mother of his kids so being step mom might be a little odd.|`|oojO4WAraa	Of all the people I have know with major age differences in their relationship - none of them have worked out.  My dad married a woman(girl) that was 25 years younger than him - that didn't work.  I think badly of the man for going after someone his daughter's age, and I don't think very highly of the girl involved either - like dating her father.  But - hey - it's your life.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	i don't know of anyone in your situation but i mean if you really care about him and you don't mind the fact that everyone is going to disapprove then you can give it a try.|`|KkRb3paPaa	you are 18 now. so it's not illegal since he's 45. but if you like him that's all that matters
ZblY9yRIaa	LIP GLOSS!! my little sisters party was a hollywood theme... she's 12 and the goody bags included lip gloss, lotion, and glitter. all her friends loved them.

GOOD LUCK.|`|9hYOeeEAaa	when i was twelve and my friends threw parties...they always gave out candy, chocolate, lip gloss/chapstick, pens with little notebooks, bracelets, necklaces..sutff like that<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)
7dL4uyd8aa	you really need to stop saying "like" so much, <br>          and just be yourself around him and tell him that you miss him and if he loves you, he'll understand
nkpRxWLgaa	First of all, be proud of who you are.  You are Indian...that's a great heritage.  I know it's tough sometimes feeling different, but what makes you stand out from "the pack' is being who you are.  If anyone chooses not to befriend you because you're not blonde, caucasian, and don't wear hollister, they're pretty small minded.  If someone mentions your choice of dress, just laughingly tell them you used like hollister but you've found you really prefer shopping at stores like Forever 21 and brush it off.  If you don't let it bother you, it shouldn't bother them, either.  Who you are and what you like is as important as their preferences are to them and you shouldn't feel like you have to be uncomfortable about it if yours are different.  Just be the beautiful person you are and smile, be friendly, and be happy you are who you are.  You'll make friends with anyone who's not judgemental about anyone who's different.  If some of them are, what have you lost?  Focus on those who like you, yourself, not anyone who wants you to be just like them.
ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	You guys aren't together though? It is a good thing. It means he's comfortable around you and maybe even likes you. Trust is always good in a relationship OR friendship. Make sure you trust him a lot as well though, and if you're unsure of telling him something personal, or feel uncomfortable doing so, then you don't have to. I'm sure he's a good friend.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	i would say that's a good sign, because no guy really trusts a girl so much that they tell them everything, unless they like him. in my experience, anyway.|`|4Lzf3wenaa	It definitely is a good sign.  Before you do anything though, try to see if he feels the same way.  You don't want to freak him out, and I don't mean that to scare you but don't be too quick to say something.  If he can feel comfortable telling you everything then that is already a good basis for a possible relationship.  I'm sure he likes you back, but if you feel like you need to say something go for it.  You already have the trust thing going for you.  What someone said about him being clueless is probably dead on, I know I am about any girl liking me.|`|4IYKRhxIaa	it is a good sign that hes comfortable around you and you feel so comfortable that its easy to talk to eachother and be hanest with the other and tell eachother everything. thats really good! i hope it works out and i hope i helped!|`|dcb0c032d3b6c037f3cfdb4dac72663eaa	Of course it's an excellent sign.

He probably is clueless about how you truly feel about him. When you feel its right you should reveal your feelings about him since you guys can tell eachother everything and see if he feels the same.|`|oKycCBqQaa	from a guys point of view,<br>   dats pretty cool cuz like a guy rarely finds a girl who he can be open with <br>  but be careful dont stay in the friend zone cuz then u guys just friends and nothing wil come out of it<br>  maybe u should trry to c if he likes u<br>  then if yea then u guys should be fine ..<br>  good luck|`|NJrkgBaWaa	Its a great sign, if your guy friend can tell you anything that means he is extremely comfortable with you and maybe he likes you back, you never know :P<br>  <br>  Good lucK!|`|KJCw5BaZaa	It's a super great sign.

c5501d7af062f728e28883d70bec4816aa	yes do tell him. if you don't you will regret it. and besides what's the worst that can happen? bob doesn't like you back. so what. then the two of you will stay friends. (im pretty sure he likes you though) your best friend will mind. so what. if she doesn't support your feelings just because it's her ex (whom she shouldn't have feelings for anyways). and your ex... pretty much same story. it's none of his business. you two are broken up. he has his life, you have your life. if you don't think you can make it with all this 'history' then decide before telling him that you like him. if you don't think it will work out. don't tell him. simple. <br>  good luck<br>  princess xxx|`|GCAoz9VGaa	Talk to your best friend first.|`|GBGKCzHhaa	Well, maybe you should discuss it with your friend first... And, if you date your ex's best friend, it may come back around and sock you in the face! I had to learn that the hard way...<br>  Now my relationship with both of them is screwed up. But anyway, at least talk to your best friend about it - you could possibly be hurting her by liking someone she used to feel for.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|DD3hrcq1aa	same thing happened to me but turned out differently(badly)<br>  <br>   ya if he trusts you you should tell him|`|tZES73R0aa	let him tell you how HE feels
3yWAyps4aa	banana hammock|`|dbQHlp85aa	maybe you don't think enough of yourself. Sounds like low confidence to me. <br>  <br>  Don't constantly ask your bf's if they are going to break up with you because eventually they will... they'll get tired of that mess... it's annoying.<br>  <br>  If you keep thinking that, don't mention it.. maybe by keeping your mind occupied with something else eventually those thoughts will go away. <br>  <br>  You're waiting for the bottom to drop out which is what I used to do all of the time.. it'll go away eventually|`|88f430b4f419cb62981931e8380f7878aa	Your uncertainty is causing you to question your relationshipand look for an easy out, before you get hurt too seriously.  If and when this current relationship breaks, stop dating for a couple of months to see if you really need to date or not!|`|NHG8JPIAaa	I wouldn't want a women asking me that all the time.  If she kept asking me that then I would think she wants me to break up.  You need to stop worrying about him breaking up.  If he wanted to then he would.  If you two are having a good time together then I don't see any problem worrying about it.  Keep telling your self he loves you.  If he spends a lot of time with you then you know he has no time with any one else.  I seen some of your question you asked on your last relationship and I tell you if I knew my woman was constantly think I want to break up.  I would have to go.  You need to start trusting in the guy your with.  As long as he's telling you that he loves you then you need to keep the trust.|`|wFWytGlxaa	Just realize: whatever happens, happens for a reason.

I used to worry a lot when I was younger, but over time it gradually went away. Maybe you just need some assurance from a friend.|`|AA11988503	Then you shouldn't be in a relationship.<br>  <br>  You need to be completely confident and secure in who you are. And no guy will give you that. You need to find it on your own and once you can be a complete, happy person by yourself, then you're ready to add a guy into the equation.<br>  <br>  And if you keep asking your guy if he wants to break up with you over and over again, eventually he's gonna say yes.|`|AA11811494	Well it sounds like to me that you don't have any confidence in your relationships and that you have trusting issues with guys. Ok with that whole confidence thing you need to build that up within yourself before you will stop thinking that.

And if you asked me about breaking up every five minutes I would ditch you too.  Most relationships end with a breakup so get used to it and try to have fun and enjoy yourself like you mentioned.

ZzjUHawhaa	ask them how they they feel about certain situations and ask them what they think about certain things. they're answers will give you better judgment on their true character. secrets is another way of knowing someone, but they'll spill those after gaining ur trust and learning about u.|`|pod9nzo7aa	You could ask me some questions, then you would really know me.|`|lvK8NnZ0aa	Over a long distance, you learn about the strength of your horse; over a long time, you learn about the character of your friend.|`|f1JnPsDhaa	maybe their background<br>  <br>  religion<br>  <br>  hobbies<br>  <br>  favorite sports<br>  <br>  if they are married<br>  <br>  or dating<br>  <br>  or single<br>  <br>  job<br>  <br>  what they are "willing" to do<br>  <br>  anything they dont like<br>  <br>  foods they dont like<br>  <br>  common interests<br>  <br>  ect

I think he'd rather hear it from you than anyone else.|`|z3QsWmzpaa	tell him the truth you just go back and tell him that you were scared of losing him so you lied <br>  if you dont tell him he will hear it from someone else the truth ALWAYS comes out in the end|`|06O8FaOjaa	WELL FIRST OF ALL YU SHOULD OF KEPT YUR LEGS CLOSE AND SECOND OF ALL NOW YU GOT TO TELL HYM THE TRUTH|`|1oPwKe0Jaa	Let it gooo so quickly if you love and want to stay with your boyfriend|`|9YOW497Jaa	good that's great
trb2s2uoaa	haha first off don't feel bad cause we all do at first rofl :)<br>  but anyway first off if you wanna flirt with someone that you dunno and you want them to say something to you walk past him several times and 1) make eye contact. 2) smile and walk by. 3) walk by and turn your head a little backwards and smile. 4) walk by again and if he's interested he will say something. (my friends and i have done it way too many times) but if you wanna just flirt in person just laugh at what the guy says like at all times pretty much. make sure you always smile. if he says something you don't like or whatever "pout" and he will flirt and they think it's hawt when girls pout anyway rofl. just do cutesy things. and if you wanna flirt while texting play 20 questions or the truth game. it's a really flirty game and you get to know the guy better. hope this helps and good luck! **you'll get better ;)|`|ns1F0p8Laa	just relax and be yourself|`|M3CsxF2jaa	OK you dont know how to flirt. sounds liked you are too young to be flirting|`|jAL8GTDaaa	Sadly there is no "How to flirt book". Bummer eh? Heres the thing. People flirt in soooo many different ways. Remember in the third grade when boys teased you? That is flirting, teasing can be flirting the same as a lot of different ways. It is a skill, so you need to practice just being around guys. After being around them the butterflies seem  less panic attack feeling. If you mess up or made a fool out of yourself we all been there. Relax. No guy wants a girl to hypervenatle on a date. Good luck.|`|m8C8MU2Maa	Don't wear the upper topper flopper stopper and when around the boys check out their lower decker pecker checkers to see the results.|`|loG7TrLMaa	do the eyebrow jump that Groucho was famous for and do sly sort of smile<br>  <br>  also use the word 'maybe' a lot|`|XpTOtE25aa	genuinely smile and laugh with them, thats a main attraction to guys to know that you're up for a laugh and a good time. <br>  compliment them, and just get to know them really then you'll figure out what makes them tick <br>  best of luck<br>  X|`|XHcyDT2Xaa	dont flirt...just be yourself because if you flirt, then all the guys will notice and then soon you will get used to it and do it even more and then everyone will call you a slut|`|QAiyrzZbaa	omg im a hudge flirt and im good at it, i wouldnt no how to  tell you to flirt unless you give me an example, its hard to explain flirtin|`|PcPswmv5aa	SMILE SMILE SMILE SMILE and SMILE.  It is the key to everything in dating.  You must learn to give a great smile.|`|CWY0szzoaa	If you are hot you can just grab any guy's butt<br>  and they will follow you<br>  I guarantee it|`|19210ea4297045e16871c0f3287825d1aa	dont worry ur not the only one who makes a fool out of herself around guys...best way is to be urself...smile and interact there's really nothing else i can tell u when it comes to flirting|`|ru5qKN4eaa	You just need to smile, ask a lot of questions (feel guys' biceps, they love that), and act confidently coy.  It'll work.|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	smile make jokes sometimes touch them|`|rZygUA9faa	Make sure you have a good physical appearance first of all. Guys are very judgmental and usually base their interest on physical attractiveness. Make sure you laugh at his jokes, smile, and make eye contact. Don't get yourself overexcited and giddy though, keep it cool, but make sure you're not a completely different person. Don't give direct answers, guys will want to know more if you say something like "maybe" or something like that. Just know that if a guy is interested in you, he will take the time to talk to you or try to make you laugh. A guy who isn't interested won't even bother with you. Good luck!|`|tZES73R0aa	Twirl your hair and then just say things like " oh yeah so what are you doing this weekend?" But you have to make it sound like you just wanna know. Then when he answers and he says nothing why? just say oh i was just wondering cuz i was going to the mall with some people and i wanted to know if you wanted to come.  Usually works for me. Dont listen to things like grabbing their butts thts stupid.  Girls tht do tht look like whores
7utsLRfyaa	well holly<br>  i do not know you obviusly<br>  but i have been playing a game where you have to kill stik people and its funny<br>  anyway<br>  i font know, maybe go for the guy your age<br>  i think we shud be best mates hahaha lol<br>  xxxxxxxx|`|Jf0s6pByaa	I think that you should go with harry and what in the world does tbh mean|`|ns1F0p8Laa	God|`|JV0i77uiaa	Go out with the who ask you first.  If you go out with Harry and he is nice you have a chance to know him.  If Alex likes you and he see you going with Harry he probably get over his shyness and ask you out.  You are single and not married so you can try both of them, eventually you will found out which one you choose.  I hope you choose the best.  Good luck|`|YV1bOajXaa	Go for the one in the Scout group.  If you start dating the one in your school it will be really awkward if you break up.|`|loG7TrLMaa	Try Charlie. He gets free sodas at the malt shoppe|`|AA11811494	I personally think you should go with the guy from your scout unit, but to be real honest you need to sit down and write the pros and cons for both guys and then see which one you have the most for and then rip it up and throw it in the trash and go with the one that makes you happy the most. i know it sounds stupid but i've done it. and i don't mean it ALWAYS works but it kinda helps a little.|`|m8C8MU2Maa	The first guy deserves a chance or an explanation before you pick up another guy.  Sounds like your leading him on so do the right thing and not dump him without having a conversation about it.  The second guy will still be around if it doesn't work out.|`|8IZrK7Guaa	well i would go with harry because he acually talks to you. and you have liked him for 3 months! i mean come on lol. but what ever you think is best should do|`|PN7XMglOaa	Choose Alex , he's a " keeper " . Good luck .|`|dUglyCKDaa	what does tbh mean? I would personally go for the guy at school, he can spend more time with you.|`|5MFBoWSAaa	Hmm.. this is a tricky one.<br>  I'd say Alex.. only because I love that name.|`|LUqn0BOAaa	the first guy.(:|`|vl8ND1qVaa	well its really up to you..i mean do you want a cyber relationship with the boy at skool? or do you want a guy that you see and can talk to? it just depends on the chemistry you have with both of the guys and if you like one more than the other then you can go for it. but its just a matter of getting to know both of them and see who you are more interested in. 3 months is also a long time haha so idk...age shouldnt matter either i mean its just a number....i hope i helped ya out.|`|iVapI5JPaa	I'm in this situation to! Who to choose? I say just let things go a while longer, but not too long so they lose interest in you! Or just choose with whomever you honestly lean towards more.|`|m2HUqZIpaa	i honestly think you'd be better off with the first guy. you might not get too see him as much, but you can't have a 'cyber' relationship, where the only time you two talk is through cell phones and computers.|`|f4RnGIeSaa	It is not really possible to answer such a question as we know nothing about either boy really.<br>  <br>  It is quite alright to continue talking to both of them and get a real feel of how they are so you can mke the decision yourself.|`|y7JML5UYaa	i think the harry gut is best because you guys actually talk and hang out. guys that flirt over the internet, arent going to do that in real life. trust me!|`|ru5qKN4eaa	It sounds to me, that if you're in scouts, you don't need to get ANY boyfriend and you need to worry about being a kid.<br>  <br>  There's plenty of time for boy drama later... be a kid now.|`|XHcyDT2Xaa	i say go for harry...the other guy sounds great and all, but people can be totally different over texting or emailing or whatever so go for the guy that you actually talk to|`|642d31f48073a651ec790aef08754fe9aa	well ill go with harry..because if the other one is shy..it wont work like that..=-/ but on the other hand..young guys fall a lil bit too much...eeekkkee not cool..cuz later its hard to get rid of them|`|xwz6yZYlaa	try going on a date with both - not at the same time - and see which one you like better, have more interests w/ and everything.<br>  :D<br>  good luck!<br>  pick me best answer?!|`|YkzPfyp2aa	Get to know each one a little bit more.  There might be something about one of them that you might like more or dislike.|`|bezgko8Zaa	It depends on who really has the same interests as you. find all little about their past you never know who they have dated before. idk its just random|`|YSAfYkPwaa	What do WE know? We don't even know the guys.<br>  <br>  You choose. You make the risk.|`|nk7a56ipaa	who does the sap run for most?? thats who you pick|`|e5dEoqiqaa	i think Harry's better for you.<br>  good luck :)|`|bZZEIjmFaa	flip a coin|`|0dnfyDWqaa	this is just me but i think asking total strangers to choose who they thik would be good for me out of 2 people we don't even know is really dumb....<br>  <br>  honestly just go with your heart and decide like that hahaha|`|GfWzE1puaa	I suggest you give it time. Continue talking to both of them, get to know them both. And... take a big risk and say hey to alex and school! a little hey! in the halls can open a guy up quick. He's probably waiting for you to make the first move.<br>  I can't tell you who's best and no one else can either. YOU will be the decider of that. Pick the guy who has that awesome chemistry and treats you like you deserve. And if neither do, then oh well. <br>  You're young, and life goes on. People come and go until you find those that really matter.<br>  <br>  ~Best of luck~|`|OQwFQTdFaa	I've had a couple "online relationships lol" such as i would meet  a girl somewhere exchange contacts etc then texted her or aimed her or whatever. I always flirted a lot but when it came down to going out in person it felt weird and  a little uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  When you start dating it gets awkward and never last too long no matter how much he's flirting.<br>  <br>  My vote is for Harry. seems like good guy. and way better off than online guy. "alex"<br>  <br>  BUt still you need to make decision.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped you out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  xDDDD|`|9RA7mPYBaa	can you go out for an innocent coffee with both of them? maybe that will ease some confusion. However, I cannot tell you who to go out with because I, along with everyone else don't know you.

Hope everything works out :)|`|BG8rwbGIaa	harry|`|OHCFKcayaa	alex|`|OhwCzGWYaa	harry|`|YXMX1LhEaa	Harry but Alex sounds sweet|`|011sgO01aa	the guy that will talk to you.|`|DUq74Xr7aa	which ones babies would look cuter?  maybe you could have one from each!|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	try them both out thats what i did and im happy with my gf|`|izPkVvEuaa	im my opinion you'd be better off with Harry, he's more social and can actually confront you in person, now its said that opposites attracts and you said you were shy, I think Harry would be best, it's hard to base a relationship over msn, although Alex may be able to flirt with you over msn and say such nice things, if you think about it, he's only actually saying it to a computer screen, but do you think he'd actually be able to say it to your face like Harry?  I don't think the age difference matters, its only one year and as long as he's good to you!  I know Alex looks at you and flirts on msn, but how long do you think it'll take for him to confront you and say those things to your face? You need a balance in your relationship.  hope that helps...good luck!
KcHtNFBbaa	Maybe right now you're not ready to "talk" on the phone.  Being busy is probably the most normal reason people don't return calls all the time.  There is nothing wrong with email.  In fact, sometimes you can express yourself better in email.  When you email that someone you know, let them know that you would like to call but everything is so hectic or so "busy" right now.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you'll find a good response and you won't feel so torn about having to call them because they left a phone message.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
bO2rzfISaa	Sounds like you've tolerated this situation too long. I'd put him out. I'm sure he can find someone else to take advantage of.  Where are his parents? How did he become your responsibility?|`|CpNVSJpmaa	Do not buy him any luxuries , or give him money when he wants to go out<br>  If he doesn't help around the house , don't make him dinner . He can make himself dinner . <br>  If he doesn't help out with the kids don't make him dinner.<br>  Limit his time on the computer or the tv . <br>  He should also be made to act like an adult , make sure he pulls his weight , doing the chores etc.<br>  If he doesnt do anything still , tell him you will ask him to leave the house , maybe arrange with someone you trust or relatives that he should stay with them or ask if they can make a job available for him.|`|i15KoiJhaa	When he helps out with the chores, then he gets to eat.<br>  When he help out with the Kids, then he gets to eat.<br>  <br>  When he does not help out with anything, then he gets to get a job or be hungry.<br>  <br>  He is taking advantage of the situation. While I understand he is only 17 years old, he is not your Child and nothing is owed to him.<br>  <br>  Don't buy him a new monitor, or clothes or luxuries and let him know he gets to stay there because he is contributing... no contribution, no free ride.|`|n0BU43vkaa	Don't support him financially. He's got a warm bed to sleep in at night, if he's hungry he's welcome to the food you guys buy for the whole household to eat when he's hungry and for school purposes okay but otherwise if he wants items because he WANTS them than he will have to go out get a job and buy it himself when he has his own money. It doesn't sound like he believes you will do anything harsh to him so he's willing. You want him to learn the value of a dollar so make him work for his own. My brother is the same way, he never thinks of anyone but himself, never helped out, he's 17 now too by the way so my parents provided all the necessary stuff for him but if he wanted any thing for like a computer game or an Wii he had to get a job and earn the money himself. It sounds harsh but he learns more that way than letting him get his way. Do it with your brother in law, he needs a shake up for his routine. Because you both cant do EVERYTHING for him, he needs to learn responsibility.
FIcUOgk6aa	Plan A) Ask him if he likes you.<br>  <br>  I think he only likes you as a friend because if he liked you, then he wouldn't be teasing you!!|`|ru5qKN4eaa	He's in loooooooooooooove with you.|`|koaMArmAaa	hahhahahahahahahah<br>  maybe you do smell<br>  make sure you dont.
QZ2T1uJoaa	Play pranks such as call your crush,run around and do stuff you would never do like go to your crush's house and ask if you can borrow some yams sneak into your crushes hous and steal his underwear. and if my dumb ideas don't work rent that movie sleepover but tust me they do just about the same things.|`|vdUbxZhUaa	dance to DDR<br>  sing on singstar<br>  rock on rockband<br>  and play on guitar hero<br>  <br>  quaker quaker is fun<br>  <br>  you say, "Quaker Quaker has begun, no more laughing, no more fun." then the first to talk or make any noise on purpose has to go into another room as the rest of you three pick three numbers for you to be and say what your dares are. make rules as to what and what not the dares can be. then call the person back and ask if they want say 1, 2, or 3, or a, b, or c. Say she says B and she doesn't like, she can roll the barrel *pick a new one* then she can choice between the two. She can do this 3 times in the whole game. Then after she picks and completes she sits down and says the line and now she CAN talk because she has been it and you can't be it twice. After the second round is completed the new person will say the line and can talk. you can't touch other people, throw things, turn away, or not listen.<br>  <br>  Also truth or dare, and moment of truth is fun.<br>  <br>  watch movies or go to the movies or something.<br>  <br>  play outside or sports<br>  <br>  think of something fun <br>  <br>  Hope I helped =)|`|Q6o0EzPYaa	1st of all movies are great rent them or buy or use a red box if you have one near.

Yuuuck-ouch.<br>  <br>  Too many feelings all at once.  <br>  <br>  But please understand that he may be brilliant at nuclear physics and you might end up being brilliant in the fashion design industry.  Don't assume that because he got into cambridge, that he's any more intelligent than you: he's just got different interests which led him down a different path.  Capiche?<br>  <br>  When you become more understanding of your own strengths and brilliant skills (which life will eventually show you) you won't feel jealous of him, you'll just celebrate his abilities along with your own.  It'll go away on its own.  In the mean time, my heart goes out to you, the whole thing sucks.<br>  <br>  Robbed. Absolutely robbed!|`|ZYXjLqJVaa	you are not as smart as him face it.

trb2s2uoaa	hmmmm it kinda sounds to me like she's in to you!<br>  cause well, i'm really nawt shy, but i have a lot of shy friends and they do the same thing. and they will be like so and so just talked me and we had a conversation and everything. (and so on) but i do think she likes you. just make her giggle A LOT! and try to talk to her all the time and get her number. get to know her better!<br>  **hope this helps! good luck<br>  xoxo|`|ns1F0p8Laa	She probably is shy and it would be beneficial to approach and try to get to know her.|`|SQekGM8gaa	hhuuummm. you know what can help you sort out these important questions. . . <br>  <br>  <br>  ORANGE MOCHA FRAPACHINOS!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Honestly does it matter if she likes you if you won't ask her out?|`|lem2dgtmaa	She does seem shy, but you know, that is how shy girls are.<br>  She is probably afraid and nervous to ask you out or call you, but you both seem to connect with each other when you talk. She may like you, and she may not. <br>  Just give her some time, and maybe get to know her better and then ask her if she likes you. <br>  Good luck! :)|`|swZEnNv0aa	i think she really likes you, but is too shy to approach you. keep talking to her, if shes opening up to you like that, then it means she at least likes you enough to tell you things. if you keep talking to her, then she'll eventually be more outgoing and start approaching you.|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	She is interested. Take your time and get to know her. Don't let your friends push you to push her and she end up shutting down.|`|YsBsELBbaa	I think she definitely likes you. She's just shy.|`|AA10747963	Sounds like she is me. I'm so shy like the girl. I always do the same thing, I can' t even say hi until they speaks to me first. If a guy speaks to me, I try enjoying talk to him and that makes me feel I want to talk to him more. But it doesn't mean I like him.  I think she is just getting feel comfortable to talk to you since you approached her. But I am sure she likes you as a friend, she would want to hang out with you.|`|pWz8d8MBaa	ur not close enough to tell,, when ur in a good conversation ask her for her number and txt her and  ask her who she likes, dont be embaressed if u guys are friends it shouldnt be a big deal and if she likes u shell be supe happy u asked, if she says i cant tel u or something she likes u and u definitly should ask her friends to ask her if she likes u then ask her out.|`|8WP9Gu1saa	I suspect she had poor eyesight and needs a pair of glasses or contact lenses. Kidding aside, such things are possible that she only talks to someone when they are within her limited vision. Maybe you should ask her.|`|m8C8MU2Maa	Being shy makes it hard to initiate contact.  I think she feels comfortable talking with you and you should know she likes you.  Ask her out.|`|56Mb4BXIaa	YEA She wants to ride you|`|PN7XMglOaa	she likes you as a friend|`|l7GjBVvhaa	I highly doubt she is talking to you bc she thinks its rude not to. Like you said she is shy. She may not feel comfortable to approach you. Do you like her back? I mean she is probably thinking the same thing about you. Ha ha. How you talk to her when you are at your locker not else where. I would simply, if you, start saying hi to her in the halls, if you see her with her friends talking walk up to her and say hi, or mention something from a previous convo. I mean heck you say you have had good talks and all. If she was just talking to  you bc she didn't want to be rude she wouldn't open up too much. Just don't think to much into it. She may just like you as a friend or maybe more. Never know till you get to know her. If you are interested in her though, ask one day if you can have lunch together or meet somewhere after school to study or talk.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you..............|`|xX3q2T9Aaa	I think she likes you at least as a friend, otherwise why would she share personal stories with you and talk to you for more than what is polite. I am shy to and don't really talk to people other than my friends or talk with people when my friends are around. I don't really acknowladge people at school even if they are sortof friends but if they talk to me I'll be able to talk easier because I know that they want to talk to me|`|AA11988503	It's hard to tell, it could go either way. The best way to find out is to talk to her more and more and eventually get her to hang out when you're hanging out with your friends, or ask if she'll sit at your table at lunch, or come to your soccer match or something. If she goes for it, then maybe she's into you.<br>  <br>  But if you don't like her, then just stay friendly like you are and keep it at that.|`|uTQCKQQ9aa	I would say she likes you, or at lest she likes talking to you. Get her phone number and call her a few times then maybe ask her out on a date over the phone that way she will have the comfort of her on home and want feel pressured. you could even ask her out as a friend my guess is she doesn't have much experience with boys.|`|hYQTOabRaa	Take it from a shy girl. . . she likes you.  I guarantee you she's a romantic type.  Don't just go up to and say, "So, uh, it's seems to me you like me, uh, is that true?"  Be creative.  Since she's opens up to you if you pay attention to what she tells you you should be able to pick up on the kind of things she likes and you should be able to come up with a really cool way to ask her out.  You'll have a date by Prom!|`|u1Ki6tSBaa	she probably likes you but is too scared to go up to you and actually start the conversation just keep talkin to her maybe eventually she will open up and start saying hi and startin the conversation first give her more time to get comfortable|`|9ewRarFuaa	i think she likes you but may not feel confident enough to start up a conversation. when you get to know her better, shell probly start saying hi to her in the halls. for now though, just keep goin ur doing good|`|cfJywdN2aa	*sigh* Hmm I am not sure, Maybe your the first guy to talk to her or somthing or she just needed someone to talk to. Id say ask how she feels and tell her u like her IF you do. Id say she likes you|`|7ZsD0Irtaa	im shy but if i feel comfortable around someone or like them i start to open up so you have pretty good chance<br>  <br>  i think she likes you go for it!|`|ba68cf573db5bb6350b804fc08b0e071aa	I have no idea buddy.<br>  Conversation doesnt mean she likes you, she could just be being polite and making small talk.<br>  <br>  But ya never know :)<br>  Ask her on a date?|`|WXfGnnzKaa	I think you should ask her to hangout and if she says yes then she likes you, likes you. If no she might just like youas a friend.|`|PDqZH4QMaa	if she is opening up to you then yes, she likes you but doesnt know how to tell you. keep talking to her. get her number ~if you like her~|`|tAPR9qPpaa	Im shy, but when i person i like talks to me, i seem so outgoing and different. I guess we feel comfertable around them.|`|XHcyDT2Xaa	i think that because she opens up to you so much, maybe you should ask her that|`|3yWAyps4aa	why does everyone ask the same question, have you tried asking her?????????????????????????????|`|GPfI4qUgaa	i'd say so :] im a shy girl, and i act like tha sometimes|`|cSPxoFe6aa	take my advice due she likes you!!!!!|`|XpTOtE25aa	its a tricking one but i think she may like you, she's just incredibly shy or she just likes you a lot.<br>  one way to see is to drop in a question about her weekend, like 'how was your weekend?' if she replies it was bad weekend make a comment you should meet up next weekend and have a really good weekend, if she says it was a good weekend, ask her what she did and make a comment like, 'wow thats sounds awesome, do you wanna do it/go again this weekend'<br>  best of luck<br>  X|`|VxdKfSgHaa	Well if she's really as shy as you make her sound then she might and she must consider you a friend cause you said she only talks to friends and are you friends with her friends if so ask them or maybe hang out with them at lunch and stuff          as to her liking you I'm not going to get your hopes up by saying definitely but I'm 75% sure she does but you should make the first move, ask her if she's going to an upcoming dance I think you'll know what to do from there<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|XtSNsOkbaa	Maybe she does. There's a great chance. If she opens up to you, you should open up to her. I f you like her ask her out or to do something you both like as a friendly starter. If you don't like you should still try to be nice to her. It seems like she likes you. She tells you everything and soon you might realize you might like her! Hope this helped!|`|OrKLpzenaa	People don't just open up so they don't come off rude. When I'm not trying to be rude, I just make friendly one word or one sentence replies. If a shy girl opens up to you, that says wonders, believe me. She may not look you in the eye when you walk by, but next time you pass her look back and she if she's looking at you then.|`|I6Mma2duaa	it sounds like she likes you <br>  <br>  i think you should try to progress it <br>  <br>  ask for her number and tell her you're interested in her and go on from her reply if shes to shy to admit it give her some time because being shy is nothing you can stop being overnight|`|tZES73R0aa	It sound to me that she is just shy.  Offer her help on hw or something and then give her something to talk about. Or you can always make her feel comfortable when your around. Let her warm up to you.|`|p6BXHhxnaa	She likes you, you lady-killer!<br>  <br>  Fish jumped right in the boat!  All you gotta do, son, is smack 'er with the oar!<br>  <br>  That is to say, boat that bass.  Make a move.  Take her to the movies and get her lost in those big brown/blue/green eyes.|`|6EEyonjZaa	Maybe you could get a friend to start talking to her and see if she opens up to your friend.  Give it a shot.  I think she likes you.|`|xDk9egepaa	She is wondering if you like her so you should just tell her you do (if you do) and I bet she will say she does too. You have little to lose.|`|w2ppi6ulaa	Well its hard to tell. Why dont you ask her to coffee or lunch. You can chat and find out what she really thinks of you.  Hope everything works out! :)|`|XyW61gukaa	Thats a slighty hard thing to tell.... because its possible she likes you, <br>  but also maybe she wants to get to know you better so she knows you wont hurt her in any way.|`|Yz9eCNMfaa	she prob really likes you. talk to her more get her to open up.|`|BDqgnPqZaa	I think she does just don't ask her if she does becauseit can only go downhill from there|`|EEVx7gKeaa	I think she's crushin on you!|`|St6Jvc3Daa	Since I'm a shy girl too, I would say no. sorry.|`|hagHy93paa	yeah she likes u|`|ZYXjLqJVaa	no she doesnt like you|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	go for it|`|nO4w8Hnsaa	girls girls girls!! seems like they are only good for one reason huh?! =] all the guys know what im saying. but lets see her. they are definitely drama queens so really if this girl is shy and quiet, thats GOOD. If i were you i would keep her on your list. I think she likes you, it seems like a sign, if she is willing to open up to you and stuff ya know thats great she has to!. she is jsut shy and i be t she has never had a boyfriend before so you could be her first. To bad she wont stay shy forever, all married men know what its like to have some women nagging you all the time. SOmetimes you will just wanna say " ***** get up and do it yourself" so enjoy her while she is shy. cuz once they open up to much then your screwed
NqlWkqm9aa	Ok honestly...<br>  <br>  <br>  No shes not my cup of tea, mainly because she is a dog.|`|RIZpDdNgaa	ew. I just barfed.|`|ORTMJq0Saa	NO! she is horrible!! Honestly she is Awwful|`|AA11899313	Not to my taste.<br>  <br>  Sorry.<br>  <br>  Sash.|`|v2rhWswRaa	the picture doesnt do her much justice...|`|ff545BLyaa	Honestly I think not...  Gross I have this fear of fat people I don't know why I just do.|`|4kfljeIGaa	I would say she is pretty cute.  She does have beautiful eyes, though.  Maybe it's just the way she's smiling, but she looks like someone with a zany sense of humor.|`|flMOEeNnaa	I do not find her physically appealing but someone might.|`|m7O5Nyx1aa	um a bit :/<br>  she could be, but she needs to sort out clothes e.t.c too, since these have an effect on someone's attractiveness too =)<br>  x|`|20Hpqmuzaa	she is beautiful....|`|MmmcKU52aa	her eyes are gorgeous!<br>  that hair cut isn't working for her though.<br>  nor is that camera angle...|`|06O8FaOjaa	THATS NOT THE BUSINESS HELL TO THE NOOO AND ITS PROBLEY YU|`|9YM0whxLaa	she would be preetier if she<br>  grew out her hair and maybe try....|`|z3QsWmzpaa	yeahh =]|`|hX4LdP9Zaa	no, i'm sorry. she's not.<br>  and who is the other girl in your<br>  photobucket album? you know, the<br>  pretty one.. i dont think thats you..<br>  <br>  answer mine? ;<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoD.J.vUMKnymp4hpZI2aDfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223142504AAieMxS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|uJ4lMFCpaa	No offense, but she looks quite terrible, in fact, one of the worst I have seen.<br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|oRvur8Djaa	she's ok.<br>  i would say its not such a great photo of her, but yeah she is in her own way.<br>  please dont take my answer offensive(:|`|0dO3z3XKaa	More cute than pretty.|`|GahiILuCaa	Pure honesty, that thing is hideous|`|EayT8T5Gaa	Im sorry but i have to be honest with you<br>  she is not cute!! im sorry!!! she looks like an old lady!!<br>  sorry!!!you said to be honest!!!|`|ba68cf573db5bb6350b804fc08b0e071aa	I think shes pretty :)|`|EEVx7gKeaa	Yes.|`|nBaRuZ5xaa	beauty comes from the inside|`|kxrGsNVPaa	She looks like a Muppet|`|cMAlbDaSaa	hot i would knock the hell out of that|`|S9ZNGhqyaa	uh......... not really in my opinion.|`|kCUT14ggaa	sure|`|RFTzEc5Jaa	i'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooo very sory, but she's not. so sorry
wF3YmF4Naa	So it's not quite a year, but I dated a guy for 8 months. Everything was great. Until he broke up with me on our 8 month anniversary. He gave me the line, "I just have too much on my plate right now. Who knows, in 3 months I may be begging you to come back."<br>  Take it from me, he's lying. He's trying to make the break up easier by giving you hope. And even if he does come back, chances are he's not a keeper. You've been together for a year, if he's skipping out now then somethings wrong. Plus, even if he does come back to you, what will happen if you stay together or get married and then something big happens. Can you trust him to stay with you if you get sick or you loose a child or a job.<br>  Not worth it, find someone who is.|`|Yl0ehKj1aa	sorry to hear about that but no one really knows what will happen between you 2. But me n my boyfriend brok up n have gotten bak together like 3 times n we been going together for almost 9 years on and off. If he really loves you he will come back to you but this relationship seems unfinished so i do think you will be talking to him soon. Try not to stress yourself over this i know its going to be hard...give him some time. He didnt even tell you why he broke up with you? although it will be hard give him time he will wonder why yuor not calling him n eventually call to tlk to u.|`|MvMMIxjIaa	I'm sorry ure hurting ............but if he wants space let him have it. I know u prob have a million questions for him but the more u try to contact him he will see it as u bugging him. He may just need space give him a week text him to c how he is, then the ball is in his court. It maybe he just wants to be free and is trying to let u down gently the working of mens mind are a mystery to us! Dont write it off yet just give it some time! Good Luck|`|T7ZVlHyLaa	exactly what he said. give him space. I know it's hard but just let him be. don't bother him he will wonder why your not on top of him. let this be a good time to catch up with your girlfriends let him find himself. he will come back. just don't bother him with it. <br>  <br>  don't text him or call him alot & don't ask to hang out unless he hints it & even then don't always ask.|`|6kAtYLAdaa	so my opinion and i apologize if it sounds mean is that he doesnt need to find himself hes already found someone else.  and my guess is he'll come back if it doesnt work out with her he'll come back to you saying he's found himself.|`|veHcKjxQaa	I def know where you are coming from. The SAME exact thing happened to me. Just don't do what i did.. haha... I went crazy on her! I was crying saddened, but she only said its just a break, I'm not going to be with anybody else, I just need time to think. <br>  <br>  So what I did I kept a distance, and told her to stop calling me babe if we are not together -- well the whole point is, don't freak out!, just keep it how it is, make sure he knows your still around and interested.....they will come back, just don't go crazy like I did! <br>  <br>  I basically did a 360, she said if this is how u react to a break imagine a break up (which we had a "break up" afterwards) and she didn't give us a second chance, I blew up, and now Im just moving on. She moved on 3 months later with someone else. <br>  <br>  Advice, dont worry, he's still ur baby ;)<br>  <br>  BUT<br>  <br>  Then again he might be talking to someone else, and with my ex girl she said 2 weeks later "All guys are assholes", but she never told me what happened. or why she said something so random like that.|`|UTQjqk4Baa	i am so sorry to hear that did he actually say he wants to break up or just i need to some time to think and to find myself? well maybe he has some unresolved issues that he needs to deal with you know i think that he will come back you just have to think positive
CoAixJd4aa	eggs|`|cHM2US6xaa	I like mint :)|`|rFMRgHTdaa	I guess it doesn't really matter. My bf lips don't taste like mint,or fruity or sweet they just taste like him and i love it.|`|9ewRarFuaa	i like sweet things, it makes you seem like more of a sensitive, lovable guy<br>  <br>  if they r minty, that eans you are fierce, but fresh<br>  <br>  fruty makes you seem kinda feminine.|`|fAdh5BAkaa	like beer|`|EZyHOht7aa	like an onion|`|XZlFLecLaa	like poop... just kidding! well, u answered ur own question.|`|d388tGGpaa	as long as they don't taste like feces(poooooo) then your ok HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA... rate !!|`|ijycOd8Xaa	they should taste dsepending on the guy<br>  best way is sweet it's always a nice surprise<br>  and cold too it feels good on the tounge ;D|`|AA10800565	every guys lips taste different and you cant really just say I know that my boyfriends lips taste like him i don't know how else to describe it|`|wOlFfQvmaa	i think they shud be soft and yea taste sweet like gum...|`|APt16L4Kaa	depends on his gum flavor
eN7qLfIkaa	Don't tell her. Then answers would hurt her, even if she pretends that they don't.|`|EZyHOht7aa	thats normal give her some time|`|l7GjBVvhaa	She may think its funny how shy you are about it and wants to get something out of you. If so that is childish.<br>  <br>  Don't ever answer the question about which friends of hers you would sleep with. Tell her its a stupid questions since obviously you are dating her. <br>  <br>  Why is your relationship such a secret anyhow? Are you two not suppose to be dating or is it wrong to? I don't get that part at all.<br>  <br>  She may be asking you these questions just to get to know you better and know what goes on when she is not around, plus interested in knowing you in a more sexual way.<br>  <br>  If there are things you don't want to tell her then don't not far that she wont answer things but you have to. Tell hert hat. Ha ha.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  be seeing you.|`|2S2onP86aa	Just give her answers. I mean, you seem so shy. It wouldn't be so awkward to tell her your answers. I mean she is your girlfriend, she's kidding around with you. Don't be so close-minded. Just open up like she told you. Maybe she wants more of you, than just sitting around and suffocating yourself with your shyness. You're a guy, don't be TOO SHY, nor TOO BAD. Just be a great guy, treat her well, and well, be open with her anyway. Hehe.<br>  <br>  Good luck. <3|`|MmmcKU52aa	its a trick! DO NOT tell her which of her friends you would sleep with, just be like "i cant even think about being with any girl other than you, and you know that, so please stop asking."<br>  hope i helped :]|`|hDB84Etyaa	as weird as it sounds my gf has also started asking me those types of questions too=), so yeah, i guess its normal=).|`|sr0vZPQqaa	If you tell her she'll only start moaning about it.|`|tHgHlN5Gaa	just be yourself if you want to keep dating her than tell her that she's the only one for you.  you dont need to act a certain way around her cause if your not bein yourself then thats not fair to her<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|zOrRgddFaa	Just answer her questions normally, so she sees that doesn't bother you (if you want her to stop asking them) ... She is only playing with you so don't worry about your answers|`|KjiTQZzjaa	No she is not! She just wants to know more things about you. Why don't you try asking her if she does not trust you?|`|CoAixJd4aa	tell you wud sleep with her all her friends before her then next day tell her you were joking, thatll show er!|`|NdhDUBV5aa	whatttt?? why is your relationship a "complete secret"? That's messed up.|`|xsG3woDCaa	duck and run for cover,your girl is looking for an out.|`|9ewRarFuaa	sheprobly thinks its cute when ur embarrassed. shes bein immature and shallow. it will pass
hXNwqPkcaa	Usually when a friend changes dramatically, and there was no problems between you two, is because she is not interest in your relationship (friendship).  If you truly believe if this friendship and want to save what't left of it, talk to her, confront her.  Tell her whats bothering you and ask her what's bothering her.  It might be that she feel the same way as you do, and you don't know it. But it wont hurt to ask whats happening.  Communication is the key to any relationship! Ciao'|`|nkpRxWLgaa	Perhaps she's feeling a little miffed that you haven't stayed in touch over that time?  Or that you aren't feeling so dependent on her?  Just even short emails fairly often to try to keep in touch,  letting her know you think of her and she's still important to you, may be all it takes to get rid of the awkwardness you're feeling.|`|s1RKhULXaa	I have a friend kinda like this! We go to the same school and we used to be like sisters but now she kind ignores me! All she thinks about is this guy she likes. Maybe invite her to do some stuff if she visits. Try to talk to her as much as u can and i am sure she will start talking to u more! Ask her how her life has been going.  Hope this helps.|`|kq8Grc2waa	I thnk your dreams reflect the reality of whats occuring on a subconsious level, you are aware in your subconsious mind that you are letting go of something, we all change , life is transistory, ive had lots of good friends and they were supposed to be my friends at that time in my life,then we all mvoe on,  we are all movin evolving at different rates.  <br>  <br>  I jsut stay intouch with friends in my heart, that way you dont have to face the embarassment when you talk and have nothing in common, its best to just get on with your life and think about you and all will take care of itself.<br>  <br>  X
B1egWmSNaa	Yes you should let her drive!<br>  I'm going to be honest with you: When parents are too overprotective their kids try to rebel. Its only natural. So give your daughter some space and let her drive.|`|AA10622097	Its hard, but yes, its time. Maybe not too far or too late, but you need to let go a little bit.|`|QCmRRbABaa	Yes. The fact of see her mom trusting on her, will make her more self-confident and responsible.|`|U5cj2E4caa	Your just doing your job and being a parent, but she is 16 and you can't restrict her.  Just show you trust her and let her drive alone.  However still be a parent and just don't let her do whatever she wants.<br>  <br>  Set some boundaries such as curfew,  and not smooching you for gas money. You have to give her a freedom a little but at the same time she has to learn some responsibility.  I agreed with the previous comment that if you restrict her where she feels she can't do anything, then she will rebel.|`|AA11641713	Let go of the strings mom and let her drive.  Tell her to call you when she gets where she is going and when she is leaving to come home.  Tell her to expect that for awhile until you get use to the idea that she is growing up and can drive.  We have to let them explore and grow up otherwise, they will be nothing.|`|SPh4ctPCaa	All you can really do is be her best friends instead of my mom. You should let her drive on her own. Just tell her once in a while to be safe and let her know what to do in a situation if it ever happens. Tell her what to do once in a while.
kwaYWYzSaa	I would definitely feel the same. Its not right for a bf to do that to you, because I think that he is purposely trying to make you jealous, and right now he is just waiting for your reaction, Just talk about it with him, and how much you don't like it, and if he doesn't stop, then break up with him. I know that may sound a little devastating,but if this guy really cares about you, he will do anything to make you feel better.|`|xgJbxZgfaa	oh no, i'd be upset if my boyfriend was receiving pics of half naked girls! don't think so! put ur boy in check!|`|KKrRLC7Naa	Guys are always going to look at pictures of girls, or look at other girls, they cant help that. but if he's your boyfriend he shouldnt be rubbing it in your face. tell him it upsets you, and that you dont like it. and even if he doesnt stop looking at the pictures he should stop telling you or showing you the pictures. its not fair on you for him to make you feel bad. and if he doesnt stop, then hes not worth it.|`|tVgAZ2uQaa	guys are always gonna check chicks out no matter how hot their girl is...it's just how we are wired.  as long as he doens't act on it, ur fine!
5eD7w8Hhaa	About a Girl.<br>  Greaaat song.|`|6etaFOnhaa	first answer mine THEN ill lcome back and answer urs.<br>  kay?|`|dgffPBKCaa	i agree. she sounds like a whore. i really think you should move on. if she only wants sex than its not a healthy relationship anyway.|`|aBwQ06A6aa	Yep, probably using u, and tell her to get some help w/ her drinking issues! Dump her, she aint worth it!|`|aMN30gyXaa	she kinda sounds like a whore. but tell her how you feel and if she doesnt reciprocate then MOVE ON!
yuOuoCfDaa	No you were not wrong.........some people need a taste of their own bitter medicine sometimes----but you sound crazy for still being her friend much less calling her your friend.  I can see if she just was self centered and may have hurt you with her actions.  But you totally don't like/STAND her so why entertain her.  That is crazy....if I didn't like someone not only would they be history but they would know my feelings and stay away because of my obvious actions|`|ZNo5x0Veaa	You should tell her how you feel. I think she'll understand. She's your friend!|`|6COyycOVaa	well you can't bring a living situation into it but she sounds like a pretty bad friend so instead of telling her just kind of push away from her and don't like go and visit her again for a while<br>  good luck!|`|6EEyonjZaa	there's this kid that use to be my friend through like k-6 but like this year he is so annoying and so i just try to stay away but i wouldn't tell her.  I would just hang out with someone else.|`|kq8Grc2waa	nope, we outgrow people and your energy has changed, you dont connect anymore, best to outgrow people with grace and jsut let it go, she will get the messgae. X|`|DqNS694Paa	What is it that you did exactly?? deleted her from your myspace??Jesus.
m7JM1ntbaa	oh come on.<br>  its a guy.<br>  you dont end a friendship because of that.<br>  and if you do.<br>  it shows that YOUR the one thats fake.<br>  just talk to her about it.<br>  i mean she has a boyfriend so tbh you should be able to have this guy.<br>  she cant take both guys.<br>  but if she does.<br>  then you can end the friendship|`|yuOuoCfDaa	your girlfriend is a whore and her boyfriend is stupid for not knowing that she probably slept with this guy or has already fooled around with him......God all of these young girls these days are truly donkeys.  I feel sorry for descent guys who have to deal with the mindset of these girls<br>  <br>  BTW I agree with judge.....FRIENDS DON'T EXIST!  they are more like enemies laying low to suprise you with whatever tactics they have in mind|`|nkpRxWLgaa	Sounds to me like she has a little bit of a crush on him.  Take what she said with a grain of salt...being drunk probably made her say that because she has a crush on him, herself.  He's the only one who knows that for sure and I'd hang in there unless he tells you that, himself.  Don't think what she said necessarily makes her a fake friend.  She's probably confused about her own feelings and not sure how to deal with them.  Give her a little space to come to terms with them and just be confident in your own attractiveness.|`|hXNwqPkcaa	Hello is obvious, she jealous.  If she was really your friend she would try at least to hook you up with him through her boyfriend.  Get it? She not your friend.  Stop talking to her, because she's selfish, she wants all the attention to herself.  Confront her, tell what is up with her, and why is she acting that way.  She can only answer to this question better!|`|fr9x3db1aa	don't stop being friends because of it. it's a guy.. so just tell her to back off and be honest with her and serious.|`|3AXlgGgUaa	You need to make it clear that her behaviour is upsetting you.<br>  <br>  Tell her that if she continues like this, that you will no longer be her friend.<br>  <br>  I don't think she is trying to be a cow and make you unhappy, she is trying to make herself happy and going about it the wrong way.<br>  <br>  She is just failing to see the harm she is doing...<br>  <br>  She is insecure.<br>  <br>  Once, i was going out with this guy who i really didn't fancy at all. Then i stopped going out with him and soon after he was going out with my cousin who i was very close with. <br>  <br>  Every chance i got i would throw myself at him, even though i still didn't fancy him - it was like i was trying to regain control over the situation by involving myself.<br>  <br>  I can't explain it - i didn't want to split them up, i just wanted to feel what they felt by trying to force some of the affection my way.|`|AA11892927	I'd say that she is very jealous hun! Find out if the guy you kissed wants a relationship with you, if he doesn't then perhaps it isn't worth ruining a years friendship over, however if he wants a relationship with you I'd say get with him and put your friendship to the test, if she's a decent friend then she'll be happy for you and stop acting like a tw*t, although a real friend shouldn't act the way you've described anyhow.|`|DqNS694Paa	Friends don't exist. The sooner you get this, the sooner it'll all fall into place for you to see.|`|s1RKhULXaa	She might be a little jealous! Just dont stop being her friend|`|6COyycOVaa	i would confront her! that is so mean to say even if he didn't bffs don't do stuff like that|`|wxyfgE6oaa	you should just tell her how you feel and tell her what she said hurt you and try to work things out|`|wUKFgB3Raa	Did you just say that she drinks? I think she became crazy because of drinking! Don't worry! You both have been best friends for a year. She could be your best friend if she helps you about solving your problems, or helping u up in any situations. Anyways, is she kind to you? That is the most important question just for this situation. You gotta figure out by yourself! Just ask her this question" Are we friends?" You've got to face to the truth for the good of your life, young lady! Thanks^_^
4c2YoX1Xaa	I agree its like child porn...not kool plus ur very young!!! r u in a serious relationship with this person. having sex is very emotional, is this person ready..what happens if u get pregnant,what happens if u get an infection r u gunna b able to tell your parents or go to the doctors urself without feeling embrassed...theres r soooo many reason but whteva u decide make sure its a smart choice. think b4 u act and after..best of luck|`|2Cvdu454aa	no its not that bad. its just society trying to be all moral when really no one gives a f*ck. if your 14 and you want sex then go for it. sex could possibly be the best thing on this world, and i'm not even joking.<br>  i love sex!!! :D<br>  if you completely protected there's no chance of you getting an std or being pregnant or anything like that, so the only thing it could possibly affect is your emotional health<br>  which is just bullsh*t because as soon as you have sex you'll love it. everyone does :)<br>  good luck hun<br>  xo|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	I did and I turned out ok.  I did knock someone up though.  So use double protection.  And the Pill.|`|gDGzbufuaa	Condoms are only 99% effective, the Pill is only 98% percent effective, so you have a 97.6% of being a slut when you mature.<br>  You need to go to church.<br>  <br>  P.s. stop listening to rap music.|`|vqZUGblYaa	because it's like ******* child pornography
tFRQx2QEaa	wow!!! well talk to him and tell him how u feel. Share ur feelings  both of u!!! Think bout poistive things for when the baby comes!!!<br>  plez message me if u need more help!!!|`|No3wL14Yaa	Well it does seem like he does not want to have a relationship with you. When it comes to the baby you know that you have options and I am sure you are aware of the options. I think you need to serisouly sit down and weigh out all the pros and cons of the relationship and having his baby. If you decide to keep the baby remeber you are now tied to the father for the rest of your life.|`|6ehYn1zGaa	do not get rid of the baby, no matter how hard it is to accept that your going to be doing this on your own its not the babies fault. i know people in worse situations as far as babies go and they would never do that to their child. my best friend is sixteen and she is going to be having her beby very soon, it is having it probably within a week, the dad is seventeen and on the bracelet they arent together and the dad also has a drug problem but that baby deserves a chance|`|YkzPfyp2aa	Obviously this guy is too messed up to know what he is doing or to become a father so unfortunately you can't depend on him.<br>  Perhaps you should try adoption.  I don't recommend abortion because not only is it taking a life, it is something that will be in the back of your mind forever.  Of course it is your decision.  The best of luck for you.|`|sDqJIT5Paa	DO NOT ABORT!!!!  if you feel that you can not have this baby put it up for adoption!! there are many people out there not capible to have children and would love yours!!!! if you want to abort because it embarises you that you got pregnent than you should not have done the dirty deed with some one you can not depend on!!|`|yn3KCJtPaa	give it up for adopttion|`|GvXIvHsbaa	i think you answered your own question, babe|`|4c2YoX1Xaa	wow...what ever u decide make sure its gunna b condusive to u and ur future in the long run....best wishes|`|1gkB8gRlaa	I would say that this guy is not worth it. If he wanted to be with you, he would be there. I am pro-life, so I personally would say do not abort, but consider adoption. There is some family out there just wishing for a child to come along and you could be their miracle.|`|9vckO6Cbaa	I would highly suggest adoption. Not only because I believe abortion is not always the answer, but also because I know that there are many families around that cannot have children. They would love to have your child, I'm sure.|`|OZcYNBhIaa	you know everything already u have ur options laid down choose what u feel is right<br>  abortion is not the only idea u could even put the child for adoption y should the kid suffer but this has loads of other risks<br>  <br>  the only thing i wanna say is a drug & alcohol addict will ruin ur life get away from him if u real;ly love him & he goes into rehab i can hear weddig bells but if not ask him clearly about it & then decide what u really want to do<br>  <br>  all the best with ur decision|`|vqZUGblYaa	Don't listen to the pro-lifers in this thread.  Do what you think is best.  There's nothing wrong with abortion, particularly in its early stage.  The experience alone of giving birth to a kid and having to go to school/deal with life pregnant would be enough to scare the **** out of me.  Just realize that people telling you not to abort and to give it up for adoption aren't the ones that are going to be dealing with the consequences of an unplanned pregnancy.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Yes you should leave him and forget about him. You need to face the fact that you are pregnant and the father is not going to be there, there are millions of people out there doing it and so can you. I don't think abortion is the best option but then again im not you. You will not be able to devote as much time that you want to work and other relationships but that is not the babies fault and once the baby is born you will love him/her to death no matter who the father is.|`|YTasscmKaa	Have you considered adoption? That little person shouldn't have to pay for your mistake.|`|1QT3dINMaa	You know you really can't just think about your life on a personal level because your life includes your child now and why would anyone want to hurt their child, and themselves, simply because of  a guy you dated for a month? 1 month of loving him will not compare to the 9months/40weeks that you will love the child growing inside of you, and it will not compare to the fact that you'll know you were the vessel who brought more potential into this world. You never know what your child may do. Give the child that opportunity. Thinking of job opportunities does not even level with thinking of love and life! Any true romantic relationship you would want in the future should be BLESSED to have a child!|`|71VRvldJaa	Only you can make that decision!  I'll tell you one thing I know from personal experience because my daughter married an alcoholic/drug addict......she invested 12 years of her life into this guy and she just last year accepted the fact that he's not going to change!  She's finally left him and she said it feels like the weight of the world is off her shoulders.  That relationship was like a noose around her neck and it was sucking the life out of her.<br>  Personally, I'm not one who believes in abortion but perhaps having the baby and giving it up for adoption would be a better option for you.  It's not fair to an innocent little baby to be with a mother who isn't ready to commit to all that raising a child involves.....or to be exposed to a father with addiction problems.  You've got some serious thinking to do.|`|db67c0941f0845d64edf1a84aa913e6aaa	I have had an abortion, and I can speak as someone who has been in a similar situation.  I, too, have been in love with a drug addict.  Thank God he has recovered, but not all do.  As a child who grew up and was raised by my mother, a child does need a father.  But it is not required.  A part of me does ache for his attention, but he's dead now; what can he do.  In fact, my life may have been better due to his absence.  <br>  <br>  As someone who has had an abortion ~ if you do so you will remember it for the rest of your life.  You'll calculate how old the child may have been.  What size they would be, what your life would be like... You're heart will hurt.... and when the month comes up that I had the abortion in, my heart hearts... Feels like I have indigestion.  I'll break down in the shower, driving, or in my bed.  I do this sometimes sporadically.  <br>  <br>  As someone that has had an abortion, I would never suggest one.  The hurt I feel is too much. I'd have the baby regardless if the father was a drug addict or not.  They'll bring more joy into your life than if they were not here.|`|gPlUDaRoaa	Well,if it were me,i would have the baby.Yeah it will be hard,but it can also be so rewarding.I would look at it this way,i am making enough to support myself & my baby,i have my own apartment,and i am strong enough to take care of a baby on my own.But that is me.You gotta do what you feel is right for you.If there is any part of you that is not sure then talk to someone about what your going through.Don't try & figure it out on your own.Whatever you do chose to do,you are the one who is going to have to live with it.Good luck with whatever you decide.
lWolp5Csaa	Hey, I`m 11 too and i`ve had this problem too. I either get a friend to talk to him about it, or you can just go up to her and start talking. If she doesn`t like you. forget her, she probably only sees you as what you look like not what your personality is. If she does like you and she talks back to you then just keep talking in a calm and relaxed voice.<br>  Some things to talk about.....<br>  Pets<br>  Her pets<br>  Familys<br>  favorite foods<br>  anything about you or her. tell her things about yourself, and ask her questions about hur. just get to know her better.|`|gTXUcd1maa	go up to her and tell her. she won't laugh. and even if she says no, she'll still think its sweet. and if she does laugh, well, i guess she wasn't the awesome girl you thought she was. good luck :]|`|jiqcLFdvaa	U havent really gave that much info like how old she is and whats her personality...all i have to say is just tell her I mean don't go over the top if she doesn't like you but if she laughs at you she wasn't worth it anyway...|`|6COyycOVaa	11 year old girls would love to have a boy come up to them and tell them he likes them. Chances are she will like you too because if she knows it kind of makes her like u too. (i know this is hard to understand) or if confronting is to hard just be really nice to her<br>  good luck!|`|V7vzuFLAaa	just go up to her and tell her that you like her. thats what i would want a guy to do. the worst she can say is no. you might even be surprised when she says yes. <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|JzdslIkDaa	Tell her anyway|`|30ID1MDjaa	first try talking to her and becoming friends. A lot of times, girls fall for their guy friends (i would know, every guy i've ever liked has been a close friend) <br>  when you think she might like you ask her out, and if she says no, then you still gave an awesome friend. and remember, she can always change her mind! :) goodluck|`|L6tyNwZyaa	Well if you have lockers, you could slip a note if you want to be secretive....and since your only 11, it doesn't matter

3llK5y7Baa	i have had to go through that myself and i hate it=/<br>  even if i am annoyed with him...its still hard to say it face to face<br>  sorry but i dont really have an answer but good luck and dont drag it on any longer that just makes things worse|`|ZaMzRSrraa	just tell him you want to be single and date other people......you arent ready for a serious relationship and dont want one now...you want to be free to date others...bye|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I would start by listening to him talk about how he feels about you and what he wants with you.  Focus on those specifics and see if there's something there you can use as a "deal-killer," whether it be differences on the timing of things, children, money, sex or philosophy.<br>  <br>  My guess is that after 5 months if you're not in love with him and he has treated you well, there's something in one of the big things which is keeping you from falling for him.  It's okay to break up--the alternative is staying in a loveless relationship.  Which will hurt him more?|`|oOVAbKPmaa	I'd just tell him what you told us, except leave out the " feminine qualities " part. After all, no man wants to hear that. By the way. You are right about S & D. I never post a question there for that very same reason...|`|IKXZZDH9aa	Tell him that you're just not feeling him in the way needed to sustain the type of relationship that you want. It's not rocket science yo!|`|EENUWAP7aa	Just tell him what you told us. I would at least stay friends.|`|SovaFpN8aa	I know you want to let him down easy, but don't leave him any hope, or you will never get rid of him. Tell him you have a new boyfriend, or are getting back with your ex. If you try to explain that your just not into him, or there is something about him, he will cling to the remote chance he can change your mind. Make the break clean, because he is a sweet guy, so he will be able to move on.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Hate to say it, but give him the "its Not you its Me" speech. We have all heard it before and it is lame, but it also is accurate sometimes and a easy let down. Just tell him how great he is and wonderful. You know you should feel that way about him, but you just don't. Anyway you get the idea. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	Just be honest...don't talk about the feminine qualities though.  Just say you thought you'd be feeling more at 5 months and you weren't and that you are sorry.|`|tbJraueLaa	post at singles and dating.  30's or not.|`|yy45iAbtaa	just tell him  you don't think things would work out.you don;t feel the same way he does.|`|POVsINQ1aa	just be honest with him|`|FQxUpc9baa	just tell him u do not want a relationship @ this time in your life but u have no problem w/ being his friend|`|AA11825142	Just straight up tell him that you aren't feeling the relationship, not sure why he wants you to do this in person. But maybe he was way more into you and wants to talk you out of your decision. I might not meet him in person but if you feel its neccessary then I am sure you have a heart so that is not the easiest thing to go. But I think its good you let him know instead of stringing him along any longer. Its not going to be easy but you are really doing him a favor by letting him go.|`|7cdc801bdb4ad5ebfe07957d02070809aa	Tell him what you feel. Thanks him for the time being together. Do not allow him to continue it will be worth later.
tK7XacH7aa	That's hard to say about his reason and only he would know. I think what he means about conflicted is that he has other problems and he is worrying about them and it's getting in the way of the relationship. That's just what I'm thinking anyway. He could also be thinking...Do I like her or don't I? When he asked you that question he could have made up his mind that he really does like you or he just wanted to see what you would say. So he really knows your feelings about him. Tell him the truth next time about how you feel about him and see how it goes just say.. "You know (name) I was thinking about that question you asked me about what would I say if you said that you loved me and I would say ....." Just make sure you bring it up sometime when you two are together and showing at least some interest in each other.<br>  <br>  Let him sort out his problems as of now and just be there for him.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|YxCRA5N7aa	First hear it says what "conflicted" means<br>  <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conflicted" rel="nofollow">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionar...</a><br>  <br>  And yeah he does like you good luck!|`|kHSPH0RBaa	GURL, HE LOVES/LiKES YUHH, BOYZ JUST HAVE FUNNY WAYZ OF SHOWING iT, GOOD LUCK =]]|`|UebWhbD6aa	why don't u ask he if he likes you or let your friend ask him.|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	talk to him maybe he wants to go back out?|`|Yz9eCNMfaa	well what would you do is the question???|`|cDzDzmNQaa	Maybe everything is hard for him.<br>  He wants to be your everything.<br>  No other guy.<br>  He wants you to himself.<br>  Just like you would feel if like,<br>  you loved a guy and wanted<br>  him to himself.<br>  That's prob. why he felt "conflicted"<br>  Anyways.<br>  Talk to him.

None of my kisses have ever been planned. It's literally spontaneous.|`|rZygUA9faa	Make sure you guys are both comfortable with each other first.

Well, not without her blessing anyway.|`|9tf9VF9naa	dont trust him. men lie when the have something to hide. i am sure they are having an affair.when you knew he was attracted to her why didn't you do something then. nipping in the bud is easy.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	Why admit to something that isn't happening.<br>  Regardless of how insecure you are it not a good idea to lie.|`|5OXtsCv1aa	He lied because he has something to hide!

Theres not much you can do right now, but if this persists, things will get shadier and the two of you wont even be able to communicate properly.<br>  He wont confess until his affair is completely over, or if he trying to get rid of you.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	No, I wouldn't confess.  But to be honest, my wife doesn't ever want me so I don't think she would care.

This has been really great for our kids, but after 5 years divorced, I'm still pretty sad.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I have got news for you:  Many cheaters do not confess even when there IS solid proof.<br>  <br>  Don't play PI and prosecutor in your marriage.  It won't fix your marriage and if you go to a divorce attorney with your story, the divorce attorney can take the appropriate action, including hiring a PI, if necessary to prove adultery.|`|GyrG1roTaa	probably not havent you heard that one song by shaggy "it wasent me"

I do not see the problem as long as she is in the house. She is going to have to learn to trust you at some point with boys. Being a father myself of 10 years old girls, I dread the day they start inviting boys over. It is going to happen she is just going to have to trust you and your judgement.|`|rwrDD14Jaa	Well your mom doesn't think that your responsible enough to be able to handle guys at your party so your actions probably influenced her decision.|`|V7vzuFLAaa	i think thats bull crap.|`|ou32fTcmaa	i sooo dont agree with your mom i have a guy friend that comes over all the time but they grew to love him just let your mom know its just a movie and pizza and there is going to be a lot more other people than just you and the guy|`|ytrfOGKoaa	so not fair but try to convince ur mom like: they are gay they won't hurt a fly they are good they won't do anything bad and they can eat =P you would like them mommy^^ just be sweet it'll work at least try ur best to be sweet =D

I'm not a doctor but maybe your personality can change after a stroke. Maybe it really even isn't about the movie.

Jealousy can lead to being down and thinking crazy ****.  Sometimes the mind just gets tired of that.|`|q5OJURtbaa	This means:<br>  1) You are a ****<br>  2) No he doesn't love you<br>  3) You don't love him <br>  4) You don't respect yourself|`|jzpKHdjsaa	So...why are you in an open relationship?

I know that when you are at that age, being liked and accepted by other kids your age feels like the most important thing, but I can tell you, as most adults will, it most certainly is not. You will not get a chance to do this time of your life over, and if you are not careful, you may get yourself into situations that can follow you for the rest of your life. Most adults, myself included, would give anything to be able to re-do those years. There is nothing wrong with being responsible and avoiding those bad activities. They might tease you a little at first, but that's it. In the long run, you will be better off because you stuck to your guns and did the right thing. You can look back and feel proud of yourself later.
AA10702820	Maybe she wants to hang out with other people too and thats okay. That doesn't mean that she all of a sudden hates your guts and wants nothing to do with you. If you two have been friends for that long you probably have a strong bond, so she probably wouldn't just randomly drop you. As for how they're not the best people to hang out with-what do they do? Are they people who you look at and wouldn't want to hang out with or is there something that they do that you know would get your friend in a lot of trouble?<br>  If they really aren't the right kind of people and do bad stuff that could cause trouble then maybe warn your friend and say, "Hey ___(her  name)___, I know that you might not like me getting in your business but today I saw/heard about [preferbably if you saw it that'd be best b/c rumors aren't always true] ___________________(say "your friends" or their names here)_____ doing ____________ and I just thought I'd warn you to be careful." If she gets mad then just tell her that you care about her. Don't force her to quit hangin out w/ them, that won't look good on your part-even if you do mean no harm.<br>  <br>  As for the guy stuff, Idk how old you are but as the older you get the more you're gonna notice guys and may get involved with them. If not you right now then your friends probably will. All you can do is be there for them as they are for you and really try to be a good understanding friend. Help them if you can, if you don't know what to say to help then at least listen to them. If she gets involved w/ a guy she will put him at the top of the list b/c he his important to her and boyfriends/girlfriends are always placed at the top. Nothing lasts forever though so don't worry. Just be a good friend and don't get jealous b/c your friend loves you but she may wanna chill with other people too and we gotta accept that and know its nothin personal.<br>  <br>  Give her some space and don't be quick to assume she hates you or you're gonna lose her. See if maybe she will call, text or IM you. If its been a few days and you feel like she's forgotten to talk with you then call her and say hey whats up? Give stuff time, maybe meet new people too, and see if you still feel the same. If you do then talk to her and be honest.  Tell her how you feel. Try and understand what she is saying and just let her know that you care about her and you don't wanna lose her but also say that you want to respect that she has new people in her life now-you just feel like you'll get shut out.<br>  <br>  'Hope I helped and I wish ya good luck!!|`|HrycUpKSaa	i'm in the same exact situation as you... and you say that you don't want to lose her but sometimes its better to give yourself space from her and then eventually she'll come back to you but until then you just have to try to be friends with other people and try not to worry about it|`|dw51VDotaa	you are so naive its adorable<br>  <br>  This is the real world honey. people change.

She's just figuring out her identity since you're in highschool/middle school (i'm assuming?)<br>  chill out and don't blow things out of proportion or else things will get worse. trut me, i've experienced this sort of thing|`|ytrfOGKoaa	damn that's no good <br>  try to ask her out to do things together <br>  she hangs out with a guy because she need their attention <br>  13 years old is quite young =O try to tell her it ain't cool to be bad at school, curse or gossip about other people it hurts and u guys are best friends hang more, ask her out more <br>  show her u miss her<br>  good luck ;)|`|ou32fTcmaa	i understand my friend does that to me and i knew her since second grade and now im in hs all you have to do is have a girls night out just the two of you like a sleep over it will bring you guys closer and if she likes to talk about guys than buy a cosmo magazin and it has a lot of stuff about guys|`|yCkCqFmjaa	This has happened to me before too... sometimes you can get them back and sometimes you have to let them go. Just let her know you'll still be there for her but try to find other friends to hang out with too. Believe me, trying to hold onto someone who you're falling out with will only bring you pain. Allow yourself to give her some room and let her grow and change... <br>  <br>  How come these people aren't the best folks to hang out with? Do you do bad things? Well, if they do then you should tell her, but at the same time allow her to make her own decisions.<br>  <br>  Hang in there :)<br>  <br>  God bless,<br>  Secret Agent Bucktooth

cdQryr7paa	All I can tell you is to trust your instincts and not fool yourself.<br>  He obviously has some issues about you that it will take a ton of work for him to get over.<br>  From what you have posted, his comments seem to suggest he thinks of you as beneath him, or "unclean".<br>  Your post gives me the impression that he feels he is doing you a favor by being with you.<br>  If this is a recurring fight now, think about how many times you will have to argue about it for the rest of your life with him. (if marriage is a possibility that is)<br>  Do you really need that?<br>  Life is too short.<br>  My advice is to break it off with him and find someone that isn't so judgemental.<br>  There are millions of men out there, there is no point in putting up with such crap from just one of them.<br>  Good luck.|`|AA12382198	He wants something that you can't give him.....a woman with no history.<br>  <br>  Unless he grows up really fast this relationship is doomed.<br>  <br>  Your self-esteem should prevent you from putting up with this any longer......time to move on.|`|0EUsaTfoaa	If your boyfriend is that upset about your past imagine how angry he would be if he saw you talking to a male relative he doesn't know?  The most important part of a relationship is trust.  i see very little on his side.  I would think your relationship with that guy has about the same chance as a moth in a blowtorch.  Everyone has a past but if he is more concerned about your past and not the two of yous future there probably isn't going to be one.  Find a guy who won't be bothered by your past and the two of you will find a great future.  Note: There are plenty of great guys out there don't settle for anyone but the best for you.  You deserve it.|`|NAkQdoYlaa	Hi, the past is a tricky subject! I know because I'm somewhat a jealous person lol but we have to realise the past is exactly that... the PAST. It's been and gone and there's nothing we can do to change it no matter how much we wish we could.<br>  You need to explain to your boyfriend that you love him but if he can't except your past then you need to end it between you because you can't go back and change things and you can't keep fighting about the same things over and over.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope things work out.|`|bzQNHfunaa	i am in the same boat...we fight constanly about the same crap...blow up and make up..nothing ever gets resolved! im not sure what to tell ya hun...do some soul searchin?|`|e7ryxkHkaa	honestly, every relationship has its good days and bad. it just depends on whether your heart tells u its worth it or not|`|JLjCqKZCaa	You keep having the same arguments because it hasn't yet sunk in to your head that if you marry this man, he will try to turn you into who he wants you to be - not who you are.<br>  <br>  Listen to what he is telling you. He is telling you straight out that he doesn't like the way you are, and that if he has any control at all, he will change you.<br>  <br>  The argument is the same because neither of you has changed your believes. If you marry him it will just get worse. You need to end this now. Tell him you are ending it for his benefit - so he can find a woman who better meets his needs and desires.|`|hKWj2SJoaa	Girl pleaseee ...<br>  <br>  This guy obviously doesn't see your worth since he can't tell what makes you different from other women in America. <br>  <br>  And yeah if you were brought up in a counrty you would be different, you would not have had the same experiences and if in a LEDC country, you wouldnt have the right education and the oppotunities you have now. <br>  <br>  Tell him he doesn't know what he is talking about and if he cant see your speaciality than he is no good to darling.|`|i15KoiJhaa	Good Grief!<br>  <br>  I dated a Guy just like this one...<br>  <br>  Same fight over and over and over... he too had issue because *Gasp* I had a life prior to meeting him! For God sake I had been Married and Divorced with 2 Little Girls and He ALSO had 2 Little Boys from a previous Marriage... but I digress...<br>  <br>  He was also from Honduras and in the Military and felt that he was somehow more superior as a Man then Women in general.... <br>  <br>  This issue never got resolved because to be honest, I could not "Un-Due" my life before him and he would not accept that as valid. I determined he was crazy and he was making me crazy so I ended the relationship and am so glad I did.<br>  <br>  Life is to short to spend it with a paranoid, control freak who feels you need to demand a "recall" on the life you had prior to them.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	I believe you are trying to hard for something that wont work it. If you have already talked to him about the fact that the past is the past and you have to learn to let go and he still hasn't let go then what is the point?

AA11097612	Your nipples are a very sensitive part of your body and as such piercing them will raise the sensitivity of them.  Whenever the piercing gets touched you will feel the sensation radiate through your body.  <br>  <br>  When you first have it done you will want to not have anything agitating it so you may want to wait until the summer when you can wear less.  You may draw some unwanted attention, however, as the bumps in that strategic spot will be more noticeable.  Because nipple piercings are considered to be a "sexual" thing I probably would not want to tell my parents.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|BJkfY3g4aa	You might want to check if it will have any hinderance on being able to nurse.<br>  <br>  That is if you plan on having children and or nursing. You may not even know that until the time comes...but it would be something to check into.|`|NpqAbZqpaa	Would you want your child at 16 to do it??<br>  <br>  When you are in your mid 20's and above, it's kinky, when you are below, it's more slutty  <br>  Like "hi, see my boob, you may suck it"|`|QmvYGkNJaa	Horrid. I think it's more slutty than anything else, and a little cheap.|`|NlYGbqnkaa	I think if your going to pursue a career in porn or exotic dancing you should absolutely get it done. Otherwise I think it looks cheap and slutty. There are so many other forms of self expression why go through the pain and embarrassment for something no one else really sees. If alot of people are seeing them your already on your way to your new career!|`|i15KoiJhaa	Why?<br>  <br>  Just curious, what your reason(s) are for wanting to do this?<br>  <br>  My Sister had hers done, but she said it was because if she couldn't have larger breast's she felt the need to decorate them! LOL I dunno...<br>  <br>  For me personally, I wouldn't want it done... and my Husband thinks it's unattractive... but to each their own I suppose...<br>  <br>  Probably ought to run this past the Parents though.... I am sure they will have the same question I do, considering your young age... why?|`|RhZaVwKkaa	I love nipple piercings. They are so sexy. The way they make your nipples look erect...so hot!<br>  <br>  You should go on BMEZine.com and read about different piercings, risks, and whatnot.|`|FzFSzilmaa	i find pierced nipples REALLY sexy... :D<br>  <br>  as well as other intimate piercings... ;)|`|rghk8yMeaa	ewwwww!!! thats gross and it would prolly hurt like a *****!!! i dont think it would be worth it anyways. haha! i can just imagine what your future grandkids would think!!|`|04a31323aa0674874fbc03558306d39eaa	rather you than me. Just the thought of it makes me cringe.|`|4VWoIOIwaa	Ok its the most sluttiest thing you sould do<br>  dont do it<br>  its CHEAPNESS!!!|`|YOr5LBB4aa	it's stupid|`|zKrkLeIIaa	One,it shouldn't matter what others think. If you would like to have that kind of jewelry, then go for it, so long as you know you can take care of it to prevent infection and such,accepting whatever risk.<br>  Second, men will have varying opinions. Some will find it attractive, others completely repulsive. Do the type of men you like find it nice? *again,not that what others say matters,but I'm sure for most teenagers it helps boost the confidence* <br>  Third, I don't think professional piercers do genital piercings on minors (though maybe that depends on states? Not sure). Don't try it yourself, or else you'll increase your chance of infection, and you'll be in even greater trouble with your parents. <br>  Last, you should tell your parents, especially if they may reason with it. Though if they won't accept the idea at all, don't do it (again, just in case you get infection and they wonder why you're always in distress). You shouldn't do it just because strangers on Yahoo find it nice, but don't stop yourself if YOU really want it.|`|T3crw25kaa	I'm a guy and I had one of mine done for a while.  There's some pain with getting it done.  And there can be some pain after too, especially if you bump it on something.  Mine eventually got an infection too, so I had to remove the piercing.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think it's a good idea for you for the following reasons:<br>  - Your age:  16 is a bit young for body piercing.  Most places require that you be at least 18 for very good reasons.<br>  - Because you are female, nipple piercings can interfere with your ability to breast feed in the future.<br>  - Because the piercing can get infected, I think you are taking a big chance.  There are many causes of breast cancer and who knows if infections from piercings could be one of them.<br>  - I don't find nipple piercings on girls very attractive.  You've got 34DDs.  That's more than enough to keep the guys happy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Answered with doggy-style|`|JLNhHN2Haa	Some guys may like it, but asides from future babies possibly not wanting to breastfeed on nipples which have previously been pierced, why ruin a perfectly good set of boobs for a lame piece of metal? Don't do it, it's not cool, and in a few years chances are pretty darn good you wish you had never done it. I find it an immediate turn on. Even on a girl your size. :P|`|e93d483d323b7ea0e774d586db75f7d8aa	I'll tell you somthing....It don't matter how kinky, slutty, or wtf ever.  I had it done five years ago, and never agian my friend.  That is the worste pain I ever went through in my life and I gave birt three time (twice without meds)|`|r3PgrJhDaa	I don't really see a problem with it, it's just I've heard of A LOT of peoples nipples piercings getting infected. And I'd rather just not do it if there's a chance of infection, sounds to painful.|`|QmiBEtYYaa	well i'll be blunt.. i love boobs and i love peircings so mix the 2 and i'm happy but you have to be 18 to get peircings without your parents written consent and it does sound pretty ****** painful!!|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	Usually women put earrings on to attract attention to their face. I think you know what I'm getting at. It sounds like you should double pierce your ears.|`|hGF6i3Eyaa	Had a girlfriend once that had her nipples pierced.She loved it, but then again, pain turned her on like nothing else would.|`|pNTPiTWmaa	yea it is kinda unattractive to do and will definitely turn guys off...i wouldnt say its slutty but yea cheap a lil...but just dont do it...y mess up a nice chest like that with nipple piercings|`|tuaGGXE5aa	Wait till your 18th B-day. It will be more special then. Plus your parents can't say s**t.|`|SrgKPAGUaa	wow big jugs lol but uhh no dont its unattractive to men like me|`|1NFj2CPWaa	no offense but that is really retarted and stupid to do|`|vhOQ68M5aa	Its pretty gross|`|Q1LXnEcNaa	hahahahh that would be painfullll...dont do it. usually when u have a piercing its for someone to see so ya that sounds slutty to mee, if yer gonna be showing it to ppl.

He knew that. That is why he paid for the trips and the classes. <br>  <br>  Now, this older man has 2 divorces and his daughter is far away. That says it all. He is controlling and you looked at it as passion. It is not. <br>  <br>  Control is sometimes an attraction for women who run away from good man. He seems ok until the control thing comes in. You have learned and now it is time to move on.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Oh Girl, I feel your pain!!  I know only, too well, what you are going through.  The only thing you can do is to back away and give him space and time.  I know that is the hardest thing you will ever have to do, but you need to do that if you ever hope to get back what you had.  It sounds like, maybe, he is confused about the intensity and depth of his feelings for you. Space and time are needed so that he can sit back and reflect on your relationship and his feelings for you.  Love is a very scary feeling.  And a lot of people, men and women, sometimes don't know how to handle that overwhelming feeling of being in love.  It can consume a person to the point of having to step back and catch his/her breath.  You know that old saying, "if you love someone, set him free and if he comes back to you, it was meant to be"?   Well, it is true.  Find yourself by yourself, again.  Reconnect with yourself, meet new people and learn to laugh, again.  And one day, he will show up at your door.  Just don't sit around waiting for him.  Who knows?, maybe God will send another man who truly wants commitment and is ready for a mature, loving, equal relationship with you.  Just believe in yourself and don't take it personally.  It is not you, it is him, considering his past relationships.  His feelings for you may be scaring the heck out of him and he needs to gain control over them before he feels he may mess it up with you.  You never know.  God bless you and I will be praying for you.

(Make sure you have pen handy when you call!)|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	go ask the hotels themselves.  differant hotels have differant ways of doing it, (especially best westerns, cause a lot of them are individually owned) and they dont usually list stuff like that online.<br>  <br>  when in doubt, always go down to the place you need to talk to and ask.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	It depends on the hotel. some don't offer any discounts, some offer 10% some offer 25%.  Call around and give your guests 2 options. One that's a bit nicer and one that's like a Holiday Inn. (if you have a lot of guests) if your guest list is under 75 just go to one hotel.<br>  <br>  If you aren't reserving a block then don't give them any options.  They'll think they are getting a discount if you do.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	When I had my wedding, I went through one hotel that was in close vicinity to the reception location (within one mile) and I got my guests a 25% discount.  Everyone loved it and thought it was really great that I got a hotel so close to the reception site that way if they did decide to drink, a taxi didn't break their budgets.  But in the end, I actually also arranged for a shuttle service through the hotel to pick up guests from the reception site.  <br>  <br>  I definitely recommend going through one hotel so that way, you can most likely provide the guests a discounted rate.  And go with a hotel that is nice and within a close vicinity.|`|di6p10Ifaa	I am not sure if there are any kind of discounts...you would have to just call and ask. In this day and age no one really wants to cut any one a break no matter what...ugh. I think the best thing to do is to book your rooms in blocks so your guest don't have to deal with it. I think that by booking the rooms for them you will be a good host. Good luck.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Different hotels have different options and you better get a move on it - - my hotel is lifting the block 2.5 months before the wedding so my guests have to book early if they want the discounted rate.<br>  <br>  My hotel block knocked $30 off the price (Reg 119/ Block 89).|`|bf6K6uubaa	if you're going to pay for them you should just do priceline.com where you pick your own rate...select someting super cheap and you'll end up getting a good value at a good price...it doesn't matter if these people are not next to each other and they might even prefer not being next door|`|EetB3Jpyaa	Here is what I went through. I booked a block of rooms at Hilton. When I checked the room rates online, it was about 130 bux, not including any taxes and fee in Detroit area. When I called about the wedding discounts, they gave me 99 bux per night, breakfast included. I thought it was a great deal. But then, as the wedding day comes near, I checked the hotel website again, and the price went down to 89 bux per night. So most of my guests didn't even go through my wedding discount. Some of the hotels have policy that certain percentage of the rooms you reserve has to be booked or you'll pay a penalty. Some places have a minimum number of rooms you have to reserve. But I think it would be nice to have some rooms reserved for your guests.|`|7N1gajSeaa	It depends on the hotel and how soon you do the block.<br>  <br>  Most "blocks" need to be in place a few months before the wedding ( or you may not be able to get any rooms).<br>  <br>  My wedding is in September & I did my block a few months ago.|`|AA11006063	You better do it fast...they may be all gone!
HVTXfd8Laa	Eat him. with salt.<br>  <br>  not sexually.|`|utGddhnVaa	maybe you should start looking for a man and dump the 16 year old boy who has trust issue's.|`|GBSnBbWiaa	You need to dump him he is a fake!! He is just there to make your life miserable|`|3y0w1qIBaa	It's not your fault.  It's his fault because he is not open minded of your past.|`|KZCrNa7Zaa	don't give him the option to "not want to talk about it" next time he says he doesn't want to talk about it, express how it makes you feel and just do the talking for him.  If the situation goes down hill from there, dump him because he clearly doesn't have any respect for you or your words.|`|kkFK74n4aa	Ok, you aren't going to want to hear this, but you have to get rid of this guy. If you've been with him for 10 months and he can't trust what you're telling him, it's just plain not working and isn't likely to magically start working either. Leave him in the dust and you'll eventually find someone that is actually capable of trusting another human being without checking. I can't even begin to explain how pissed off I'd be if I were you.|`|vQmO3N6Raa	well you can't control all his actions, but when you tell him about things in high school, just give fake names, and tell him you don't feel completely comfortable giving the real names, or simply say you don't remember.<br>  <br>  Tell if you really cares and loves you, he would stop hurting you like this. and if he just won't stop, i know this will be hard i know, but you'll have to move on. don't waste your time with a guy that will just hurt you and not even care. <br>  <br>  find a guy that will respect your feelings, your mind, your body, and your soul.|`|kIpDDVc9aa	Change your relationship status to "It's complicated."<br>  He'll understand.|`|RA8ZZP5Baa	Your b/f is over protective cuz he likes you.<br>  <br>  Get over it or get over him.<br>  <br>  Sorry. !<br>  <br>  maybe he doesnt like you as much as you like him, tell him if he loves you he will stop.|`|YseGAHIfaa	He's obviously selfish.. you'll be better off on your own. x|`|GhetCx0iaa	What the hell did you tell him..?|`|JhWD9NJ4aa	why is he so obsessed?<br>  if he doesnt trust you than, how is your relationship suppost to work?<br>  tell him that.<br>  and if he still doesnt trust you than, i would dump him.<br>  - hes clearly making you unhappy<br>  - doesnt trust you<br>  there important things in a relationship, making each other happp, trusting each other.<br>  to be honest i dont think he deserves you, end it now, save yourself!|`|Xc8dd6t4aa	This is why facebook is ruining the world.  People hunt other people down that they don't even know!  Just because it is online doesn't mean it isn't basically the same as stalking!!<br>  <br>  Tell your boyfriend that high school was high school.  You are with him now, and your friends or boyfriends from high school who are no longer a part of your life do not need to be a part of his life.  If he wants to stalk people from high school, he can stalk people from his own high school experience.  If he has a problem with your request, I would tell him it is over.|`|f4RnGIeSaa	It seems to me that he has serious trust issues.  Whether you are the reason for those issues or not, you may just have to let him go and move on.<br>  <br>  If he has such serious problems with trust, there is nothing that you can do to fix it, and if he is unwilling to talk about it, then obviously he isn't willing to fix it either.|`|QwiGDmqAaa	whoa, wat did you do in high school? lol, honestly dump him. its not worth it if he doesnt even trust you. theres only so much we can do fer love, sometimes ya just gotta be strong enough to let go.|`|cRxoNPYkaa	You answered your own question when you said "I can't trust my b/f".<br>  <br>  You really should look at this website.  www.thatsnotcool.com  Controlling behavior is controlling behavior, in person or online, and it's wrong.  Even more wrong to tolerate it.|`|Y7MWCVziaa	dump his @$$! leave him on the curb and tell him y you did it, theres better fish in the sea no matter how wrong you think i am.|`|9vccbqrVaa	Cheat on him with his best friend.|`|ydKGJ7Nnaa	DUMP HIM!|`|3ZO0lh7iaa	dont tell him any more things or maybe he just wants to be friends with your friends|`|FCVxLgrNaa	for some reason or another he has trust issues. for some people when you open up to them they think that youre lying to therm becuase 1) you confide in them to tell them information that no one else knows and they cant come to terms with that hes probably thinking "why is she only telling me, why doesnt everybody else know?" thats why hes searching for other poeple on your facebook cuz he doesnt trust himslef enough to know that you are telling him the truth. hope this helps.|`|ecOyy2PGaa	Sometimes, it happens when your boyfriend was not part of your circle of friends... he must be feeling the necesity to know more, If everything you told is true, you should not have a problem, let him confirm that what you told is true, if you simply say that it hurts you without a good reason he will not trust you, you are only giving him a bigger reason to distrust, he will think you are hiding something.<br>  <br>  Act cool, or tell him the complete trut, if he loves you enough, he will stay with you. (But it depends on your past mistakes too)
