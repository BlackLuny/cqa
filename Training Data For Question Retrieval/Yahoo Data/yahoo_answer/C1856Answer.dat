joQ6cZ5Maa	First, you are right that the 9800 is just a clone of the 8800. nVidia just added memory, overclocked the chip and packaged it as new. (It is going to be the 250 now, but shhhhh, don't tell anybody). <br>  <br>  The big problem when you look at reviews is that many sites are nVidia fan-boy sites. That being said, the ATi HD 4850 can hold it's own with the 9800 GTX (not just a GT) on many of these sites. <br>  <br>  In the end, I would check your bridge chipset of your mobo. If the chipset is nVidia, go with nVidia, if it is ATi, go with ATi. This would prevent conflicts with the cards and the mobo. I know that myself and many other techs have had to work long unnecessary hours to get a ATi card to work with a nVidia chipset. <br>  <br>  If your chipset is another, such as Intel or Via, then go with what you feel comfortable with. I would either recommend the HD 4850 or the 9800 GT and be leaning to the 4850 as it does have DX10.1 which is better. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	As Manitou stated, it is all based on your chipset, and since you have an ATi chipset, the HD4850 would likely be best for your machine (or, if you can find it - and the extra cash, the 4850X2, but you may not be able to fit it into your case, as like all dual GPU cards, it isn't small).<br>  <br>  Despite what at least one person stated, the 9x cards are pure clones of 8x cards (in one case, a 7x card), that have simply been overclocked and had memory added. The irony is that the basic card they 9x card started from had fewer bugs.<br>  <br>  The last "new" card before the 280 and 295 nVidia put out was the 8x generation cards.<br>  <br>  Now, if you want to award Manitou Best Answer before the 4 day limit runs out, try checking the options just under your question. One might enable you to do so. It's been a while since I posted a question, and I let that one go to voting if I recall. :D|`|1VaH8D3Raa	With today's tec numbers on the cards for sale<br>  .<br>  Is kind of like which motor better for my car <br>  .<br>  A big one or a big one<br>  .<br>  They all give the same finish effect <br>  .<br>  What you see <br>  .<br>  And the big ruler of that is the program used to make that monitor light up<br>  .|`|VDk3JMcDaa	get the 9800gt... they over clock the best out of the cards you have there and the 9800 is not a clone of the 8800 but it does have the same processor... the 9600 would be slower then the 8800|`|mMy1xzAEaa	get the ATI Radeon HD4850<br>  beats all in terms of price and performance.........|`|d6Jgwdsbaa	Well basically its all predicated on what your MOBO (motherboard) can handle. Some motherboards can't handle extreme cards(Weird i know) but you should research the cards and decide for yourself. Some people have different opinions than others. Lets say that the Ge-Force 9800GT has face melting graphics to some people. But then you also get those people who don't know how to install a simple video card because they either forgot a power cord or because it isn't seated properly. Then they give the card a bad review. Me personally i like the Ge-Force 9800GT mainly because of the incredible speed and the revamped graphics processors in the card itself. But you should decide.|`|mhDl76VHaa	HD 4850, it is A must.

Alternatively, use a button to add text to and colour the buttons to match the cell colours with appropriate text so if you want the purple to switch to Data menu you type AltA on it, if Review menu, AltR, if formulas, AltM etc.  If this is not what you mean, perhaps you can be more explicit in your question.|`|oKFAt7Lsaa	Is it possible to use a value or text or a formula rather than the format to select the cell of interest to you ?|`|PGMIrRrAaa	Excel doesn't have eyes so it doesn't know what colour the cells are.<br>  <br>  What criteria are you using to make the cells one of four colours in the first place?

Make sure the detected OS is the operating system you have installed and then type “y” and press enter.<br>            * You will also be prompted for a “load identifier”. This is the user friendly name that is displayed when selecting advanced startup options. You can type anything you want here, but it is best to type the full name of the operating system (such as “Windows XP Home Edition).<br>     8. Eject the CD from your computer. Type “exit” and press enter.

JjKpIoxAaa	The Samsung NC20 is a new 12.1" screen "netbook" that follows the very successful Samsung NC10 (10" screen) netbook.  One significant difference is the processor.  The NC20 uses the Via Nano as opposed to the Intel Atom.  Many people consider the Nano to be a superior processor compared to the Atom.  The NC20 is slightly larger than the NC10 due to its 12" screen and it weighs a little more - about 3.3 pounds with the 6-cell battery.  Battery life appears to be about 3 to 5 hours depending on specific usage.  As with all other netbooks, the NC20 does not have a built-in CD or DVD drive.  As such, you will need to install/load software using an external (USB) drive or via a shared network drive.<br>       <br>  In addition to the Nano processor and 12" screen, the NC20 has a better screen resolution (1280 x 800) as compared to other netbooks.  The only other rival on sale in the USA at this point is the Dell Mini-12.  However, Asus recently announced the release of a new 12" screen netbook - the S121.  This will be a more "upscale" netbook with leather palm rests, Swarovski leaded crystal hinges and maybe a new version of Windows - "7".  However, no release date or price for this model has been announced by Asus as yet.<br>      <br>  The Samsung NC20 was released for sale in Europe in mid-February but has not been released in the USA.  Samsung has given me a "mid to late March" date for shipment to US retailers.  No official price as yet but expect it be be about $575 based on its current price in the UK.<br>       <br>  By all initial accounts from Europe, the NC20 is a very good machine.  It has a sleek design and excellent build quality.  Keep in mind that netbooks are intended for those of us that want excellent portability, low weight, decent battery life, and do not need the massive processing power of traditional dual core processor "laptops".<br>       <br>  With its 12" screen and Nano processor, the NC20 appears to up the ante in the current netbook wars.  Keep in mind that netbook sales went from less than 1% of total computer sales in 2007 to about 8% in 2008.  2009 is projected to see even bigger growth.  This should be very good for consumers looking for low-cost portable computers but maybe not so good for traditional laptop manufacturers in the long run.
LF2oShTLaa	Go into your computers sound options, in the control panel. Plug your headphones in and they should pop-up as where the sound should be now routed to. Open their properties by right clicking the device (headphones) Then view the "Levels" tab or any other tab that has to do with sound, and check the levels in there make sure they are set high enough. Now for A specific program, you must go into their controls tab- Ventrilo for instance much be set-up to broadcast the sound into the headphones instead of the speakers, since it does not autotomatically change the sound to them when you plug the headphones in. Open vent click setup *after you choose a user, each settings for a user are different* then in the main tab (voice) go to the right and change to where it says output device to which ever you want, head phones or speaker, and the Input device to your microphone.<br>  These settings should be exactly the same for any other voice talking software eg: yahoo messenger, skype etc.<br>  <br>  Goodluck hopes this helps

3d6bn4Qzaa	In general, anything sort of certification that you can add to your resume can only help you.  But really, it depends on your goals.  If you are looking to bypass college and just work for IT somewhere, then yes, it will help your resume.  If you are going to school for computer engineering, then no, we consider those worthless.

Some Hard drives would work on both SCSI for example. <br>  <br>  Apples problem was that they didn't follow the same route, as the others. they kept to themselves, so as PCs and Microsoft became joined the prices dropped and people started to buy more of them. <br>  <br>  Apple Mac's have always been at the front end of DTP and Video, their processor design made the machines run cooler, and fast for the amount of processing power they had. for years they lost the home market. Today Mac's have entered the home market again, and are doing a very good job. many top end software developers create software for both Mac's and Windows based machines they even run on Intel CPU's.<br>  <br>  So again to your question!  they both do their jobs well but some things each will do better.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  RR|`|gSwfzEJgaa	Here are some facts I found online(They're not mine):<br>  <br>  Fact 1: Macs are brainwashers. Ever notice how most Mac users are skinny? It's because of all the calories they burn because they can't shut up about how great their Macs are. What is it about Apple that makes its users unable to shut their mouths? Everywhere I go, there's another idiot with a Mac preaching about how much better Macs are than PCs. They regurgitate lines directly from Apple's marketing campaign, like "it just works." I have the following rebuttals to this argument: <br>  <br>   If everything on a Mac just works, then why does a website called "Mac fix it" exist? Here are a few choice topics on macfixitforums.com:<br>  <br>      -Login window stuck!<br>      -lower caSe "S" key not working!!<br>      -Menu bar keeps flashing<br>      -I can't drag and drop!<br>  <br>  Waaaah, boo hoo! I can't drag and drop! Looks like Macs aren't perfect after all, which leads me to my second point: <br>  <br>  Fact 2: I don't know why Mac users get so defensive when you call them idiots. I mean, Apple is a company that has built its entire user base around the fact that its users can't do simple things like turn their computers on. Heck, most Mac users can't even talk without using their hands, which ranks their intelligence somewhere near a zuchinni: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tq7yykR-DM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tq7yykR-...</a><br>  <br>  Stupid user base aside, I will never own a Mac. It's not so much that I'm a PC loyalist(I am, though).  It's that I'm not stylish enough to own one. Most iPod commercials feature guys with long hair, chicks roller skating, and guys wearing open-toes shoes. I have dandruff, and I buy most of my jeans from a grocery store. I feel like in order to have a Mac, I need to be:<br>  <br>    # An artist.<br>    # In a band.<br>    # Unemployed (see above). <br>  <br>  Fact 3: PCs Are Better For Games. Macs have, for some reason, have never been very good to gamers -- games on the Mac have largely been an afterthought while Microsoft is knee-deep in its Xbox experiment. For PC owners, having a top-of-the-line computer means being able to buy an assortment of titles so large you’ll never really have to pick up a videogame system. Meanwhile, the Mac makes you feel like a Soviet searching the bread shelves for crumbs of entertainment that may be released on the whim of cruel developers. Add to that the cost and difficulties Macs have in swapping out graphics cards, which is necessary if, perhaps, you actually wanted to keep playing modern games. GameTap and Steam make the PC a gaming-on-demand service with hundreds of retro and current titles there for the taking. GameTap works on Macs, but only Intel ones -- and not for all titles. And so it goes, until you want to tear your hair out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Fact 4: PCs Are Better Media Machines. I can see the Mac owners already bleeding out of their ears over this one. "F**k you, Macs can do everything with media in the entire universe!" No, they can’t. Three letters for you: D.V.R. Windows Media Center has been a DVR replacement for years now, streaming all the video content your torrenting heart desires to boot, because Bill Gates swings that way. Steve Jobs prefers Front Row, Apple’s happy little interface that has no TiVo magic whatsoever. Apple TV, a set-top box that should have been a DVR, instead locks you to an iTunes account enslavement and a media-purchasing DRM-rental-blindered idea of “fun.” It may be easier to use an iPod and a Mac to download TV shows, but you’re also stuck with one media store, no recording options, and no way out once you’re completely sucked in. Yeah, I know there are third-party DVR options for the Mac. For how much Macs cost, you'd think they could bundle one in, right?<br>  <br>  Fact 5: PCs Are More Cost-Effective. Macs are still priced too high. Tell me you don’t agree. And if you don’t, then you’ve been hypnotized, too. The Apple Stores and apple.com have created a one-world pricing universe for all things Mac, while in the PC world there are multiple manufacturers, tons of retail stores, loads of sales and rebates, and plenty of cheap refurbished parts on the market that people can use to make their own dream machines. Apple’s cheapest laptop is still more than $1,000. You can get a PC laptop for under $500 at Best Buy. Yes, they’re different in quality -- but an eight-year-old who needs to plunk out a book report doesn't need 0.13 inch-thin wafers of aluminum. Families, non-nerds, and most of the adult world need less-expensive options, and for $500, the only thing Apple sells that has a screen and reads email is an iPhone or an iTouch.<br>  <br>  Fact 6: You can't install the Mac OS. If you've just built a computer with nothing on it, you are perfectly free to install Windows. You just need to make sure you have a fast processor and enough RAM. It doesn't matter who made it. Just buy a Windows disk, put it in the drive, and you've got a computer. The thing is-you just can't install Mac. Apple just doesn't let you. End of story.<br>  <br>  Fact 7: It's Still a PC World Out There. Just in

LHWeXLJ3aa	Yes, it's possible to run your own website with any functionality you need, for absolutely no cost, and without any advertising at all.<br>  You simply need to run your own web server.<br>  <br>  Here's the steps involved:<br>  1) Create your web site<br>  2) Setup a cheap old computer you have lying around with Apache/ISS and PHP/ASP/J2EE and MySQL/PostgreSQL. Linux or Windows doesn't matter.<br>  3) Get a free subdomain from No-IP or DynDns - they will work with either static or dynamic IPs (with their respective free update clients). If you want to, you can pay for a proper domain name (which go for as cheap as a couple US$ these days).<br>  <br>  Voila, you're now hosting your own website with unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth (if your internet plan is unlimited), unlimited database schemas, full access, all the features you could ever need, and it didn't cost you a cent.<br>  <br>  You aren't at the mercy of some shady, unreliable third-party who you KNOW simply cannot survive financially without there being SOME catch; you don't have to be constrained by those stupid "now any idiot can pretend to be a web designer!" WYSIWYG "site-o-matic" editors or "now you too can make a site that looks exactly the same as our other 10 million users" template selectors; and you don't have to build a site on the crumbling foundation of the bane of the internet - social networking websites.<br>  <br>  And the best part is, if your site ever becomes popular beyond what you imagined and your private server is no longer suitable (or you no longer have the time to maintain/manage it), you can just find a proper web host that supports the platforms your site is already built on, and just shift your site there without disrupting your visitors.<br>  <br>  And the free experience you gain in running a whole web server certainly won't ago astray either. Running your own web server is like all your Christmases at once for a web developer.<br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  Yes, the computer you use as the web server must be left on and running 24/7 and connected to broadband internet. If the computer is off, on Standby, or Hibernate, it won't be serving web pages, that's how computers work. The monitor doesn't need to be on, you don't even need one connected (see: UltraVNC), but the actual PC must remain on.<br>  <br>  Do NOT use your regular PC (that you use for internet, IM, email, games etc) - not that you can't, but it's a really bad idea. Your server software will be consuming resources, and the server needs to be kept as clean and functional as possible - the more software on it and the more you use it, the more likely it is to crash or fail, killing your website. Not fun for users visiting your site to find it stop working halfway through, that's how you lose visitors.<br>  <br>  More detailed steps as requested:<br>  1) Find a computer to use. It doesn't have to be powerful, anything capable of running Windows XP and a generous amount of RAM will do fine. We're talking the cheapest Core2 Duo or a decent Athlon 64. If you have/can find a spare computer 5 or less years old, it will do fine. It will be running 24/7 so you may want to replace the power supply or add some cooling fans. Again, do NOT use your regular, everyday use PC.<br>  <br>  2) Choose your OS. Linux will work wonderfully if you know it, but Windows XP is just fine too. I run Windows XP and assume you have no Linux knowledge, so the remaining steps will focus on Windows XP. Truth be told the steps vary wildly depending on your configuration, so I will also assume you want Apache, MySQL and PHP. That's a popular combination often referred to as WAMP.<br>  <br>  3) Download and install the Apache web server (Apache HTTPD). It's free. Browse through the httpd.conf file to configure it, referring to the internet if there's something you don't understand (the file is commented throughout, and the default settings should mostly be fine). Ensure you can reach your site before proceeding (point your browser at http://localhost)<br>  <br>  4) Download and install PHP, also free. Search the web for tutorials on how to configure Apache to use it. Make sure you test it before proceeding (create a PHP test file in your site directory, calling phpinfo(), and browse to that page).<br>  <br>  5)  Download and install MySQL, again it's free. Again refer to web tutorials to get PHP's MySQL connection working, and again test out PHP-MySQL connectivity with a test PHP page. The MySQL GUI Tools also contain some handy tools to administer and query MySQL quickly and easily.<br>  <br>  NB: You may be tempted to download a software package called "WAMP", "XAMPP" or similar packages. They come with all the server software in one install, already configured to go. Don't. You lose valuable technical experience if you do. Technical experience that will be immensely helpful in developing and maintaining a web site (even if you eventually pay for hosting) - being able to diagnose problems with your server/3rd-party web host, and work around or fix them, will help out a lot. If you download one, you might as well just setup a MySpace page as the experience you gain and control you have is going to be about the same.<br>  <br>  6) At this point, if you don't know HTML, CSS, PHP or SQL, take the time to learn them. W3Schools is a good resource, as is the official PHP manual. <br>  <br>  7) Build your website. Do it now, before you bother setting up a domain name or spending any money. Plan what exactly you want for your site - what are your goals? What should your site be about? Will it have user accounts? Paid subscriptions? Spend some time designing it: features, functionality, layout, database schemas, everything. Build it. Test it. Get friends to test it. Get strangers to test it. Do what everyone else does and post the URL (or screenshots or whatever) on Yahoo asking for opinions (you may need to do step 8 first to get it publicly accessible). Make sure you get a web developer to test it for security too, not much fun putting up a site only to have it broken or defaced in the first week.<br>  <br>  8) Now you have a web server running and a site ready to go, but unless somebody knows your IP address they can't access it. Even worse if your ISP gives you a dynamic IP address. Also, if you have a firewall and/or a router, your server may not be accessible from the internet anyway.<br>  a)Make sure you configure these appropriately (add firewall exceptions and use port forwarding) until you're able to type your public IP address into a browser and reach your site.<br>  b) Sign up for a free domain name from No-IP or DynDns. You will get a subdomain like yoursite.dyndns.org. Both these sites also offer (paid) full domain names (yoursite.com etc) which are useful if you have a dynamic IP address. If you have a static IP, you can still use those services, but you could also go out and just rent a full domain name from any seller, like GoDaddy.<br>  <br>  9) So now you have your website running on your own server, and it's on the internet. What next? Advertise it. Generate the content. Do what you need to do to get visitors. Maintain your site: make frequent backups of all pages and data, setup a password-protected testing section so you can try new things safely. Run a similar setup on your everyday PC so you can use it as a development environment. Your job now is to take care of the site.<br>  <br>  Don't fully understand any of the steps I've mentioned? Easy: just google the key terms and you'll come up with plenty of information. You're not the first person to want a setup like this. And if you know how to follow steps and search the internet, it really isn't anything too difficult. If you know how the internet works and can figure out PHP/SQL scripting, setting up a functional web server is a piece of cake.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	1) Yes - if you want people to be able to connect to the site, the computer has to be running.<br>  <br>  2) Download XAMPP and install it.

cL1K7NHZaa	You're trying to open a file with an extension that Wordpad doesn't understand (.doc or .docx depending on your version of Word).  If you need to open in Wordpad, first you must open it back up in MS Word and save it as a .txt file.  Then you should be able to open it a read it in Wordpad.  Although you may loose your formatting in the .txt file.  Wordpad is a simple text editor.  You cannot do a lot of things in Wordpad that you can do in MS Word.  This being the case, Wordpad cannot read alot of the formatting "code" that MS Word puts into a document.

EGEOOZLXaa	There is no reason to convert it to 320kbps. The reason why is that most media types at present aren't even made for that size/quality music file. Another reason is that if you're going to go 320kbps, you might as well find a better format than mp3 format. mp4 or even better? Instead of upping the mp3 at 320kbps, there are far better formats. An mp3 does not play at near the quality of a CD. As for conversion, most media types (CD, hard drive, iPod) have output limitations on the quality. Now, you have to move on to the biology of the listener. Most of the time, human beings don't even notice the minor differences. The ear can only hear so much. By the time a person is 30+, they lose tones in the ears. In other words, there are teenagers who can hear more tones than 30s folks. In fact, they even made a cell phone tone that only teenagers could hear. Their teachers could not hear it, and they could get telephone calls in class. Eventually, they discovered what was going on though. But, just a side note on that last point.<br>  <br>  p.s. I don't know if this is true, but I don't even think recording studios record in 320kbps. Meaning, even while the music is live, it is not made by mp3 quality. It is made for CD quality. CD quality can be bettered, but the only problem today: can't take 80 gigs of songs with you at better than CD quality. Last, why would you want to? Music sounds fine on my iPod. I don't know about you.<br>  <br>  p.s. #2 The last thing to consider is the output device. Speakers are everything. BOSE speakers are boss!|`|ZG6DeAzPaa	If you record sound at 128 kbps, and upconvert it to 320 kbps, then no, you aren't going to hear a difference. <br>  <br>  Honestly, most people will not hear a difference between 128 and uncompressed FLAC. <br>  <br>  Basically, if you record a sound at 128kbps, and you convert it to 320kbps, you aren't doing anything but increasing the file size.<br>  <br>  If you want to hear some uncompressed music, see if you can find/purchase music in FLAC format ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Lossless_Audio_Codec" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Lossle...</a> ) . Try listening to a compressed version, and then listen to that... There will most likely be a difference.... but most of the time it is not worth it compared to the convenience of small mp3s.|`|a30c9df48f39a58a08a1083d248e6555aa	Ok, you need to think of a sine wave.<br>  <br>  What digital music does is analog to digital, which of is measured in bits and bytes. 128Kbs is considered to be about as good as it gets. But it depends on your taste.<br>  <br>  A sine wave is a nice smooth slope, digital music converts that slope using X Y Plots, and no matter how you slice it digital music will have a staggered slope, however small it may be.<br>  <br>  The measure of Kbs really translates to how many plots the sine wave has, There is a lot of discussion, but the general consensus is 128Kbs is the sweet spot for audio quality and file size.

3XMCQ4Spaa	Unix is a operating system (or rather a group of similar operating systems), just like Windows is an operating system.<br>  <br>  Linux is a free implementation of a Unix-like operating system.<br>  <br>  An operating system is a layer between the hardware and the applications you run on a computer.  Rather than writing applications that "knows" all about the peculierness any of the hardware you may have -- from details of old cd-rom drives to the most modern plotter -- you write applications for a particular operating system, and  leave it up to the OS to know about all the details of your hardware -- like how a SCSI harddrive from Sony differs from a IDE harddrive from Smasung... the OS hides the details from the applications, so from the apllication pov, it's just "a disk".  The application simply makes requests to the OS about needing to read or write a file, and the OS takes care of how it's actually done.<br>  <br>  The OS also manages the computer's resources; by dividing CPU time and memory between different programs and users.  It handles read and writes from disks in an effective manner, and may impose quotas on how much space each user can use.  For resources that can only handle one request at a time -- like printers -- the OS manages ques of waiting requests.<br>  <br>  In a multi-user enviroment (like Unix), the OS make sure that different users' processes (running programs) and files are kept separate, and that one user can't go snooping in the files of other users.<br>  <br>  This mostly describe the "kernel" of the OS.  In addition the OS will come with many commands, utlities and tools, for the day-to-day running, monitoring and maintenance of the system.  These may include commands for copying, moving and deleting files... simple text-editors... tool for adding/removing applications... tool for adding/removing users... tools for looking at system load and kill processes.  In addition, the OS may comes with some basic applications (as it does in Windows), like simple programs for editing/viewing graphics, playing music and surfing the web.<br>  <br>  The philosiphy behind Unix is having many small programs that each do *one particular* thing (but do it very well), and then being able to connect these commands together (pipeline) or call one from another.  In Unix there are one command for searching for files and directories, and three commands for finding a particular word or phrase in a file.  In Windows, there is one program that does both, even though these are very different operations.  The Unix method, is much more flexible.<br>  <br>  In Unix, neither the command-interperter -- the shell -- nor the Graphical User Interface -- X -- are "hardwired" into the OS.  The user may choose between several different shells, and may even choose to use other programs (like an editor) as his "shell".  The same applies for the GUI.  The low-level functionality is on most systems handled by X, but could also be handled by any other suitable program.  The high-level functionality is handled by "window managers" (or more complex "desktop enviroments"), and the user may chose between a dozen different based on his personal taste.|`|8UXzYsNoaa	Koppe74 gave an excellent answer.  I'll add just a bit more.  Often, administrators load servers with Linux or some variant of Unix because it is more stable - even if the average users only use Windows.  So if you end up administering a web server, creating a database, doing system backups, or something else, there is a good chance that you'll end up using Unix - even it if is only to change permissions on files.  Of course, this isn't the only reason that Linux is used, but it is a common one.|`|5NIKZPqpaa	Ohhh Unix is an operation system as well, like Windows and Linux of our today's generation.. It is an early version of Linux... Before Linux came, it was Unix. Hope this helps.

HBAMQJPLaa	Do you understand what software piracy is?<br>  <br>  Unlike other things you purchase, the software applications and fonts you buy don't belong to you. Instead, you become a licensed user — you purchase the right to use the software on a single computer, but you can't put copies on other machines or pass that software along to colleagues. Software piracy is the illegal distribution and/or reproduction of  software applications or fonts for business or personal use. Whether software piracy is deliberate or not, it is still illegal and punishable by law.<br>  <br>  Piracy comes in many forms. Here are some common piracy methods:<br>  <br>  Licensed user duplication for unlicensed users <br>  Illegal Internet distribution <br>  Illegal use of software over a network <br>  Distributing specialized education versions to unauthorized markets <br>  Distribution of inauthentic  software or fonts<br>  Sharing product installation keys<br>  Sownloading from pirate sites, etc|`|1IWEKwznaa	MS Word is not free software.

7ZfGqo3qaa	For processors of the Pentium-4 era, comparisons are easy.  That's what AMD's number in front of the plus sign tells you - approximate performance relative to an Intel Pentium-class chip!  <br>  <br>  An Athlon 2500+ performs like a Pentium-4 clocked at 2.5Ghz (even though its actual clockspeed is 1.83Ghz)  while a 3800+ would be equivalent to a Pentium-4 at 3.8Ghz. This also holds true for early dual-core processors.  The Athlon X2 4400+ performs like a Pentium-D at 4.4Ghz.  <br>  <br>  In your case, the 3.0Ghz Pentium-4 is the stronger performer.<br>  <br>  It's when you get to newer CPUs (Core 2 Duos and later) that Ghz numbers don't tell you much because newer chips are so much more efficient.  Even a 2.0Ghz Core 2 Duo is faster than any Pentium-D or Athlon X2 ever manufactured.<br>    <br>  Do you have a bunch of really old parts laying around?  I'm trying to figure out how your choices come down to these when newer dual-core processors are so inexpensive.|`|FDEHTG6uaa	Can you push it a bit more and go for a dual core?

Instead, you become a licensed user — you purchase the right to use the software on a single computer, but you can't put copies on other machines or pass that software along to colleagues. Software piracy is the illegal distribution and/or reproduction of  software applications or fonts for business or personal use. Whether software piracy is deliberate or not, it is still illegal and punishable by law.<br>  <br>  Piracy comes in many forms. Here are some common piracy methods:<br>  <br>  Licensed user duplication for unlicensed users <br>  Illegal Internet distribution <br>  Illegal use of software over a network <br>  Distributing specialized education versions to unauthorized markets <br>  Distribution of inauthentic  software or fonts<br>  Sharing product installation keys<br>  Sownloading from pirate sites, etc|`|6aLOwNMwaa	you dont want the updates that are related to windows genuine notification but to be safe, manually download and install all updates as you see you need them.|`|J76ZJ9GXaa	You sure you want to update?

If you are using a hosting service for your website, you do not need to leave your PC on 24/7 because the site is hosted off of their servers, not yours.

It's too technical for you (and me!).<br>  <br>  You can pay a very small monthly fee to a webhost company and they can host it for you on their server. You access the back end of the website like an online hard disk using a FTP program. You upload your website files (images, html, etc) using the FTP program. You will also need to register a domain for the website.|`|81pm9Ckoaa	Yeah, you just need to get paid hosting.<br>  <br>  I recommend one of these: <a href="http://www.hosttell.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hosttell.com/</a><br>  <br>  Powweb has the best offer right now.

(like www.mywebsite.com) They allow hosting of unlimited sites so if you already have a domain name, you can transfer it to Powweb or you could use it to create one more sites and host them both on the same account.|`|AA12370001	If you are hosting your own site on your own equipment you need to have it open 24/7.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to do that, you can find other people to host it.

C3LiKhm8aa	My situation is going to be a bit different from the others, but here goes.<br>  <br>  1.  I didn't really choose the career.  I have formal training at the graduate level (see next answer) in finance, mathematics, computers,  microeconomics, macroeconomics and Bayesian statistics.  I initially used computers to solve investment problems, then became an investment computer person, in addition to managing an investment firm and finally owning my own investment management firm.<br>  <br>  2.  Formal education is MBA from a top 5 business school.  Classes in all the disciplines listed above.<br>  <br>  3.  When I graduated, 1970, computers were still housed in controlled computer rooms and time sharing was just getting started.  My training was on the software side, which was good for the times.  I have had to learn a lot about hardware and communications.<br>  <br>  Now there is a major called "Computer Science" in most large colleges and universities.  I don't know what the intellectual content of these majors or to what extent there is credentialism at work here.  My hunch is that there is a lot less going on than meets the eye and that a solid grounding in some basic theory and a lot of hands-on experience would trump a CS degree from most schools.  That's an opinion.<br>  <br>  You will probably spend a portion of your career working for yourself or for your own company.  Learn to manage a business and to deal with employees and clients.  "Up the Organization" is a good place to start.<br>  <br>  4.  I started out trading bonds and programming on the side, to make money for the firm by using the computer to solve problems or arrange information.  I wound up designing and building trading systems and information systems for some very large institutions; these systems were very profitable for all concerened.  I built some of these systems for my own use in manageing my accounts.<br>  <br>  5.  This is not the question to ask.  My passion may be bike riding, scuba diving or sailing.  Yes, I am still interested in computers after 40 years and I am still cutting code.  I am still interested in solving investment problems, but I am also working on the internet, cutting HTML, PHP, etc. code, some of which allows me to solve problems.  Others languages, BASIC, FORTRAN, etc., are specific to the problem-solving side, but have very little to do with the internet.<br>  <br>  6. I am working for myself and have been for the past 20 years.  The least attractive aspect of the job is the absence of a safety net.  The most attractive aspect is absolute freedom to pursue profitable projects and lines of inquiry without having to "clear it with the corner office."<br>  <br>  7.  It appears that financial engineering, which I was doing without calling it that, is going to be a glutted field for a long time.  Computers have changed since my time in business school, so much so that my career path is closed now.  Learn the languages that are in play now, learn to build and maintain websites, learn communication protocols.  On the business side, take some accounting; this is the way we keep score, so you should know enough to read an income statement and a balance sheet.  Take as many classes in things like information organization as possible.  Take as much statistics as you can get; I've found that having a solid grounding in statistics gave me a good framework for thinking about problems and has often given me a secret weapon; you would be surprised at how many "statistics" that get thrown around are bogus.  Then sit back and decide what part of the field interests you and spend 70% of your time in that area.  For the other 30% of the time, investigate other parts of the field, just so you always have something you can pick up on should your area fade from sight.  In other words, concentrate in one area, but be flexible enough to keep your options open in other aspects of information technology.<br>  <br>  Get the best formal education you can, take the most rigorous course of study at the best school you can get into and work your tail off to learn as much as you can.  A degree from a top school, and we all know which ones they are, is worth a lot and opens a lot of doors.  Snobby?  No, realist.<br>  <br>  Learn enough of the hardware side to allow you to understand not only which things work and don't work, but why.  <br>  <br>  Please realize that my answers are coming from someone who has been involved in the application and problem-solving software side of the business; a system programmer or hardware person would give a diametrically opposite answer, probably starting off with electrical enginneering and physics and moving on from there, but that isn't computer programmng as it's generally understood.  Neither answer is right or wrong, they are just different careers within a large field.<br>  <br>  I don't think there are many opportunities to volunteer, but I don't know.  The best training in this area is probably a mix of rigorous formal training interspersed with practical experience.  You can get practical experienc|`|UofQjvbFaa	Well the bottom line is- Get into, or I should say Dive into programming only if you're passionate about it and like programming very much..Otherwise, you're gonna have a bad time yourself and your work would give others nightmares....|`|1c2adb2d5aad294a18068c79ec140867aa	1. Why did you choose this career? - <br>  I didn't I just wanted to answer<br>  2. What formal education/training did you receive for this field? - Highschool Programming class<br>  3. Are you satisfied with your training? If not what would you change?<br>  I didn't get a lot of training, just a book and a teacher and a computer<br>  4. Were you able to go right into your career? If not what path did you take?<br>  I am not out of highschool yet therefore I have not chosen a career, I work at Alco.<br>  5. Does your career allow you to pursue your passion?<br>  Hi<br>  6. What is your favorite and your least favorite aspects of your job?<br>  I don't like my job cuz I have to listen to jerks all day.<br>  7. What advice can you give me?? - Classes to take? Internships? Volunteering? Similar careers to consider?<br>  I would say take a class on programming and make sure your college offers a programing major.<br>  <br>  8. What do you feel might be future challenges to this career?<br>  You're gonna have lots of work if people suddenly want stuff done.

2LbTrlQnaa	You might have screwed up PayPal's system by suddenly changing your bank details.

You can max your sytem out using their simple tool... check it out.|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	Go to the following link, <a href="http://www.crucial.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.crucial.com</a>  they can do an on line check which will determine which ram your motherboard supports. They will recommend the optimum amount. You can order on line and although they are not the cheapest it is worth  paying for good ram. They guarantee compatibility with your motherboard and give an excellent warranty.They also give fitting instructions.  I have used them many times and always been satisfied. Hope this helps.|`|901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	You have a limit to what it can be extened to, which you already know the limit. So you have really answered your own question.|`|JLvHGMlUaa	As long as you get the right kind of memory (SDRAM, DDR, DDR2, etc) for your system, there's no harm.  In fact, maxing out the amount of memory is a good thing (for performance)!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.crucial.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.crucial.com</a> can recommend compatible memory for your particular system.|`|eghsNMd7aa	If your system supports up to 2GB....Then you can "extend" up to 2GB? Is this a joke? If you have 512 in there now, you can add 1.5 GB.|`|PdmaKwhNaa	That depends on what other computer specs you have and what you use it for.<br>  <br>  If you use it for work, like writing docs and on i would recomend at least 1 GB, if gaming i would say 2GB.|`|2tiikN7paa	These days you would need at least 1 Gb for normal PC use (well 'normal') though if you want to do additional things it is recommendable to get more ram. Nonetheless just make sure you get the correct type of memory. I take it your system is pretty old. So you will need to find out if it supports normal DDR ram, or SDRAM. If it's newer it could support DDR2 ram or even DDR3.<br>  <br>  It's all pretty technical, but if you know what motherboard your PC has, you can find out through the website of the manufacturer.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, so if you want to buy extra ram I'd advice you to buy 1Gb of ram, or just get 2Gb as it's pretty cheap right now. (2x 1Gb so you have dual channel)|`|dGVeSmMaaa	I'm making a guess that the RAM you are using is DDR1 type..<br>  FYI..It will have 184 pins..<br>  <br>  Depend upon the no. of slots..u can choose your RAM.<br>  <br>  For more info..go to <a href="http://www.crucial.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.crucial.com.</a> It will guide you to know more about the System Motherboard and the compatibility of your System and RAM details|`|qwVtHWmIaa	<a href="http://answeringonly.allnight.nl" rel="nofollow">http://answeringonly.allnight.nl</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|oip1aYEAaa	no harm to your pc<br>  <br>  make sure how many RAM slot you have.<br>  if two, buy 2x 1GB RAM or 1x 2GB RAM<br>  <br>  make sure the RAM type also SDRAM or DDR and many new things|`|Pis2PjtPaa	this is u r wish and depending up on u r size i n hard disk
1cdsJ3lpaa	Get better cooling, that's usually the solution, how long did you run Prime95? Usually a 30-60 minute run for stability. Maybe to need to up your voltage.|`|SHXzkL6Gaa	Most chances are that the problem is not the CPU but rather the RAM or the HyperTransport. I would verify this by leaving the FSB at 200 and changing the multi to 15. That will give you the same overclock without any effect on the RAM and HyperTransport speed. If this works then your problem is RAM related (probably means that you need to relax the timing or raise the memory voltage) or HyperTransport (I don't remember the details, but there is a setting in the bios to change the divider on it). If it doesn't work, you probably have to check other speed/timing related settings such as T1/T2, CPU voltage, etc.|`|3LjMWownaa	Even though its not much of a jump, its a good thing to start with small increments anyways.  What the other guy said though, increase the voltage on your PSU.  I THINK you can do that through the BIOS.  I could be wrong.  I'm not an OC'er but I've definitly looked into it for my system as well.|`|eghsNMd7aa	Try toning it down a bit and see what happens. Just like back it down hlafway to original settings and see if it will boot.|`|3LHsCLVFaa	HHHMMM.<br>  While there are currently no AMD processors that are rated at 160W, this is a requirement for the ACC since top of the line Phenom CPUs such as the 9950BE can certainly approach that when overclocked.<br>  While AMD does not fully explain how it works, there is apparently a 6-pin interface between the CPU socket and southbridge chip that the new SB750 can take advantage of. This is supposed to not only improve communications to the southbridge but also enhance the overclock ability of AMD's K10 architecture.<br>  The 6 pin interface has been incorporated on the SB780 as best I remember and is of course used to keep the southbridge awake. Chances are you problem is sitting right at this point

If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences.

Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that.

Apple even sells its own "Mighty Mouse," which DOES have a right click.

VkEtK7Noaa	In short, No.<br>  <br>  How you ask? Well let's just say that there's a network of computers connected to a router, the router is a device that controls data flow between computers so they can send/recieve data and communicate with each other.<br>  <br>  I can simply hook up my laptop to the router and use what's known as a network sniffing program to intercept emails and read what the user wrote, their email address, the destination email address etc...One such program that's available for free is Wireshark.<br>  <br>  Anyways more to the point email's that use encryption, such as with SSL or SSH will be encrypted.<br>  <br>  I've personally tested the emails for gmail, yahoo, hotmail and university emails - all of these can be easily read using wireshark :-)|`|wUqeZl3Saa	Easy one. No.<br>  <br>  Email is sent as ordinary text between servers and often stored as text. As such, it is open to examination by anyone who is curious enough to look. There are some laws in place that roughly equate email with sending a snail mail letter and snoops could be punished accordingly.<br>  <br>  If you want secure privacy, you'll need to use PGP, GPG or an equivalent.  This also comes with a warning. If you use an insecure form of encryption, your email may still be read.<br>  <br>  If you are in a medical or legal related field, I would suggest you never send an email discussing a patient or client. Not even if it is encrypted. If you were to choose a bad encryption system or make mistakes using it, it could be a major problem. I've seen lawyers get mighty paranoid if you suggest sending them email even about minor stuff.<br>  <br>  Shadow Wolf

AA10570173	You have a couple of choices. One is to use the very good but rather basic text editing program that comes with the Mac. It's called (very logically) Text Edit and you will find it in the Applications folder. It will allow you to do some basic formatting, including setting tab indents, bulleted or numbered lists, paragraph indents and different fonts and some styling of the fonts. You can save a Text Edit file as .rtf (Rich Text Format), which all word processors can read, or plain text (essentially no formatting), or even as a Microsoft Word (.doc) file.<br>  <br>  You can also BUY iWork '09, which is Apple's nice little office suite, with Pages (word processing/page layout), Keynote (presentations like Powerpoint), and Numbers (a spreadsheet program like Excel). Pages would be what you would use, and you can get a lot fancier with it than with Text Edit. You can also save as/export Pages documents in Microsoft Word format.<br>  <br>  You can also download Open Office (make sure you get the version for the Mac) from www.openoffice.org. It's an Open Source package that's completely free to download and use. It includes a word processor, a spreadsheet, a presentation package, and a couple of other things. A lot of people who don't want to pay for Microsoft Office (which of course is another option for you, Microsoft Office '08 for the Mac, but it's the most expensive option) use Open Office.<br>  <br>  One other thing to note: if you are submitting your resume on line, some places will want either a Word document (and I've described how you can do that) or a PDF document. Macs are cool about PDFs, saving as a PDF is built in to the system. When you want to save as a PDF, anything that can be printed can be saved to PDF. You go to the File menu at the top of the screen, select Print, and when the Print dialog box comes up, there will be a button at the bottom labeled PDF. Click on that and select Save As PDF; make sure you pick a location, such as a Folder you've made for this or Documents, or even the Desktop. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps you!

412a8d7f34f055e06ec12c1c282acaeeaa	Its like building a pyramid. If the design is not proper and the network grows, which is usually typical, you have to go backwards and "fix" things to allow the growth. For example: You have 10 users on your network and buy a 10 port switch. You increase the size of your network by 10 people and have no way to connect them all because you have a 10 port switch. So, you now have to install a larger switch and run more wiring to it for the additional new computers. <br>  <br>  Trying to understand current network needs and anticipating future growth is essential as a network engineer :)

Then after that it is down to user preference.

GHz:  Gigahertz is 10^9 cycles per second (it is the unit of frequency).  The greater the "GHz" you have, the more data can be processed in one second, therefore increasing the overall COMPUTING performance of the computer.  (Think it can calculate more numbers per second)    I would definitely sway you against getting a Mac.  Software is scarce on the platform itself, and what's the point of buying a Mac and then a license for Windows just to get Windows on a Mac?  Why not just buy Windows.    The person who said that Windows Vista isn't reliable is just a bunch of BS and FUD.  That person probably never tried Vista and is just a bunch of hearsay.  Vista is a really great operating system and a really fun operating system too, so I'd say get a Dell.  They offer absolutely superior value with all the coupons floating around.  I have ordered many machines from them before, and they have been nearly perfect everytime!  You could proabably get a really decked out Inspiron 1525 with webcam, huge amount of RAM, Bluetooth and memory slots that come standard for under 1000 quid.  Really great machine if you ask me.

bxlYleZkaa	Yes! Because any peripheral uses the current from your laptop to power itself unless it has its own separate power supply.|`|CMl6ra8Gaa	The two most common causes of damage are from overheating and overloading.     Overheating  A coolong pad is great especially when using your notebook on your lap.      Clean your laptop, you are going to have dust in your laptop (fan inside),dust enters thru vents. Use compress air (aersol can). Clean at least once a week     Never store your laptop were the temperature exceeds 80 degrees Fahrenheit,( car or an outdoor patio).     Consider taking your battery out when using your laptop plugged into AC power. When clean the battery contacts use rubbing alcohol.     For lithium ion batteries, you do not need to discharge them fully and recharge constantly. Since they don't have the same "memory" as older nickel-metal hydride batteries, it is actually better to discharge a lithium ion only partially before recharging. You need to do a full discharge only about every 30 charges.     Overloading a battery occurs when you use an AC adapter that has a higher wattage than that specified on the laptop (and battery), or if the circuitry of the laptop consistently overcharges the battery     Here is a partial list that I do :       Dim your screen.--Cut them down to the lowest level you can tolerate to squeeze out some extra battery juice.     Minimize background processes.-- Cut down on programs running in the background.  Itunes, Desktop Search, etc.  All these add to the CPU load and cut down battery life.  Shut down everything that isnt crucial when using the battery.    Don't use the CD/DVD drive.  This uses a lot of power    Add more RAM ( I always max out Ram on my laptops)- This will allow you to process more with the memory your laptop has, rather than relying on virtual memory.      Defrag regularly --less demand you are going to put on the hard drive and your battery.    Dont multitask - Do one thing at a time when youre on battery    Turn off the autosave function.  MS-Words and Excels autosave functions are great but because they keep saving regular intervals, they work your hard driver.  Caution in doing this :-)    Disable your wireless antenna when not in use.  There are a few ways to conserve you battery life, but it sounds like you may need to replace your battery|`|dILqe7nBaa	yes it uses your battery faster  http://www.wikihow.com/Extend-Laptop-Bat...

There are several good Anti-virus programs out there. F secure is not one of those.

Fsecure will  double your boot time, it will also slow down your internet browser, It's protection is ok. But if you do get infected it's removal on a infected machine is not very good. On a laptop where a program needs to be light F secure could really slow down your computer. Many user hate Norton but this years version is very good for laptops. If you don't want Norton then look to Eset Smart Security very light.<br>  If you are using AVG paid version, There is nothing wrong with it. It's not one of my picks. I would not say it isn't good.

These are generally used to force hits to a particular website.<br>  <br>  Removal<br>  Most new hijackers will not allow a user to change back to their home page through Internet Properties. Modern hijackers' settings will most likely return upon reboot, however, well-updated antispyware software will likely remove the hijacker. Some spyware scanners have a browser page restore function to set your page back to normal or alert you when your browser page has been changed.

However, with that said, chances are that you picked up some crapware when you visited that web site. This is not the end of the world. First off, make sure that you have an up-to-date anti-virus program. I use AVG Free but there are others like Norton or McAfee. Next make sure that you have a good anti-spyware program and that it is up-to-date. I use Spybot for cleaning systems. Once you have these tools, reboot to safe mode and run complete scans. This more than likely will take care of your problems. Reboot and be careful where you surf to. Good luck.|`|1WaTRF3Caa	I have ran across this azzhole's questions twice today.

I looked into it further and it seems to be some stupid game, and he gets points whenever somebody goes there.  I have reported this user 3 times already today.  I hope they ban him already!

pUzJiMUcaa	I've seen you asking Joomla and CMS related questions for the better part of this month...I hope you're getting somewhere in this adventure..<br>  <br>  To answer your question, Virtuemart is an extension for Joomla. You will install Joomla first, then install Virtuemart into Joomla. The process isn't all that difficult once you get Joomla installed.<br>  <br>  I might suggest a couple of things to help you on your way, though..<br>  <br>  First, find a host that supports Fantastico Auto Installs. This is a great way for a novice to get running quick and easy. You don't need to worry about things like knowing your root directory and password, or your database name, or anything like that...it takes care of it all. BlueHost offers a Joomla auto-install, for example. It will get everything installed for Joomla, and you can start customizing and getting add-ons in place pretty easily (add-ons such as Virtuemart).<br>  <br>  Second, when it comes to customizing Joomla, take advantage of the community. There are thousands upon thousands of free templates out there, and installing them is child's play.<br>  <br>  I've seen people suggest things like setting up a WAMP (i think I may have even suggested that) on your home machine for testing...I think you might have better luck if you get a host going, and play around there. That way, you don't have to mess around with configurations and what not that are over your head.<br>  <br>  I've done several installs Joomla sites myself, and they are pretty easy once you get the hang of it. If you find yourself stuck, you can message me here. I can't promise that I'll have an abundance of time, to help, but you seem to be going through a quite a bit to get this up and running, so I'll do what I can if you need it.

What you are looking for is the type of AGP slot you have on the motherboard and check the AGP speed then ensure that it is compatible with the card that you want. Usually you will not notice the difference between a generation or two of graphics card but a 3 step up card will make a difference. I would ensure that the the card is compatible with the mother board (they usually are every time). If you are buying a graphics card then buy it new so you can take it back if it does not work....

pUzJiMUcaa	Programmers write code. Programming is how a computer becomes more than a paperweight.    Here's the deal: There is no software. Only different states of hardware. Programming is how the states are changed. Without it, your computer is a useless hunk of modern art at best.    If you want to get into it, do some more research. Just don't assume it is easy. And don't assume that you can develop a taste for it...if you like it, keep going. If you don't, don't kid yourself. Programmers are born, not made.|`|Xaffu60Waa	yes you actually create programs.

You make programs, applications, and computers with programming! Everything you see is a program!

SJM0rzHtaa	You CANNOT directly connect a USB port to a hard drive SATA port.<br>  <br>  To connect USB to SATA, you need an interface converter circuit board with a chip that can translate SATA signals to USB signals bidirectionally, with an HDD controller on-board.  Obviously that is not something you can make on your own, unless you know how to design microchips and have access to a billion-dollar microchip fabrication facility.<br>  <br>  Look inside USB external HDD enclosures for SATA drives, and you will find the circuit board and chips I'm talking about.<br>  <br>  It's not as simple as splicing a couple of wires.|`|GqLMdJGDaa	u cant connect directly to the usb just enabling the power and data cable from port to hdd. <br>  U need HARD DISK CASING which is available in a very cheap price in computer markets for 3.5' hdd which has some integrated small chip on a circuit connector and that connector provides connectivity from sata hdd to usb with no external power requirement !<br>  Im own using it for my laptop ...<br>  I bet upon this ...u ll really found this one the best and very useful info.|`|qaacatZzaa	Yeah I think you'd be better off getting this item (link) I have one and it works awesome, picked it up at bestbuy for like 30 bucks I believe.

If you don't, you should try to make room by freeing up some of the space used by Vista.<br>  <br>  Then boot from your ubuntu cd/dvd, and partition some of the free space for swap and the rest for ubuntu.

If ubuntu doesn't do it; edit GRUB's start-up file to include Windows Vista, and re-intsall GRUB.<br>  <br>  Reboot, and from GRUB you should be able to choose between Windows or Ubuntu.|`|TnPiiwoAaa	Install WINDOWS first, then Ubuntu. Most Linux distros will partition your drive and create a grub/lilo boot loader for you from which you can make your OS selection. If you install Ubuntu first and then Windows , Windows will recreate your boot sector and you will not be able to find your Linux installation without first running some commands from your CD.|`|hOSOawRHaa	Simply install ubuntu server first, then vista as vista will install it's own boot loader. You can do it the other way around but it requires more editing, and you have to install the grub package.

ytNlz3b7aa	Two problems here:<br>  <br>  1. There is no such thing as an "xp computer". You have a computer on which Windows XP is the installed operating system. It could just as well be Windows ME, Linux or yes, Vista.<br>  <br>  2. You can replace your operating system with Vista if your computer is robust enough to support it. You can even install both if you want to. But you need to buy the Vista installation CD to do this. There's no download.|`|YESUhp8gaa	maybe or maybe not.<br>  <br>  I suggest trying the vista upgrade advisor, it will look in your computer and see if there will be any issues, such as not meeting the requirements and incompatible drivers.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows...</a><br>  <br>  It will show if it is compatible, incompatible, and show what is incompatible but requires a patch or new version to be compatible.|`|chHPoiThaa	It will depend on what hardware you have.<br>  You will need at least 2 GIG RAM and partition at least 20 GIG of your hard drive. If you don't want to dual boot the O/S's then follow this.<br>  <br>  1. Reformat the Hard Drive and Re-install the Operating System<br>  Reformatting a disk prepares it to accept a new operating system. It also wipes out everything on the hard drive. That's your goal.<br>  Past versions of Windows (through Windows ME) allow you to create a start-up disk. You'll need one to reformat your hard drive. Click Start > Settings > Control Panel. Double-click Add/Remove Programs. Click Start-up Disk. Click Create Disk.<br>  On Windows XP, you'll need to download the disk information. Go to BootDisk.com and click "DOS — Windows 9X/NT4/2000/XP Excellent Bootdisks." Download the Windows XP Custom Install Disk and save it to a floppy.<br>  On all systems, shut down all open programs. Restart the computer with the floppy in the A: drive. At the A: prompt, type Format: C. Answer "yes" to the warning; you want to wipe out all the data. When the reformat finishes, put the Windows installation CD in the CD drive and remove the floppy. Restart and re-install Windows.<br>  Reformatting will keep most people out of your old files. But specialised shareware exists to reclaim files after reformatting. If you do not know who will get the computer — or you do know and you don't trust them — stronger measures are required.<br>  2. Buy Software and Overwrite the Disk, Again and Again and Again<br>  If you don't know much about computers, this might be easier than Step 2. There are several programs that write gibberish to the hard drive. They promise that nobody will be able to find your files after the software is utilised.<br>  Norton's SystemWorks includes an application called Wipe Info. OnTrack's DataEraser offers a similar feature, as does Jetico's BCWipe. There are more such applications on the Internet.<br>  You can leave the operating system and other files on the hard disk, if you want. These programs can be set to overwrite only the unoccupied areas. The process can be slow, because they write to the disk repeatedly. You might want to run it overnight.<br>  3. You're Totally Paranoid, so Get Out the Acetylene Torch<br>  I'm not kidding. The only absolute and assured way of protecting your data is to destroy the hard drive. To do that, you need to remove it from the computer. If you want to save the rest of the computer, touch the machine's metal frame before reaching in. Static electricity can wreck the circuitry.<br>  Unplug the wires on the hard drive and remove the mounting screws. The hard drive slides out from the back of its holder.<br>  The Pentagon shreds its hard drives. That should work, assuming you can find a hard-drive shredder. I've never seen one.<br>  You need to destroy the platters inside. Try smashing them with a hammer. Destroying them with a torch should work.<br>  Step 4 seems excessive to me. But you're right to be paranoid about this. Identity theft has become overwhelming. Personally, I would use Step 3. I believe in being careful, no matter who gets the computer.|`|EwMECSASaa	If you have the minimum requirements of a vista sure it would work.

xTNaKNOcaa	As the music in iTunes is encrypted with DRM, you cannot directly put it on any non-Apple MP3 player.

Though not free, it is very well worth a try.<br>  <br>  Below is its step by step tutorial about how to get iTunes 8 music converted to MP3:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tuneclone.com/itunes8-m4p-to-mp3.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.tuneclone.com/itunes8-m4p-to-...</a>|`|XtoW0RQNaa	<a href="http://inthisall.alone.at" rel="nofollow">http://inthisall.alone.at</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|2uJSSCBXaa	plz download the converter any of xillisoft-3gp converter download and joboshare converter download free and after u convert that file in wmp file ok
0lWB2SUwaa	The cheap route would be to purchase a screen off of ebay and install it yourself. Its really not that hard( at least it wasnt for my dell). I'm gueesing other laptops are just as easy. Basically, there are a few hinges that need to be undone and a cord to unplug/plug in. I think the screen was around $100 to $200.    That laptop was  an older model. I noticed new laptops are more streamlined/sexy and the screens aren't easy to get off. Just take it to a local computer shop and get a quote.|`|55Xq3a5Laa	In my area it costs about $400 to have the screen replaced (Parts and Labor), and that is at a cheap place. Is there any chance your laptop is still under warranty? Try giving customer service a call before inquiring about it at computer shops.

CBVl4Adsaa	oh, what's the differnce between a function and a procedure
uHSo4qYAaa	if you have a dedicated graphics card then your PC RAM has nothing to do with your graphics. hence the word "dedicated". of course a 256mb card will be faster than a 128mb card of the same type. however, the amount of RAM on your card does not mean its speed. some 128mb cards are faster than other 256mb cards. this is nothing new but there are other deciding factors that make graphics cards higher quality and faster. graphics cards use a GPU (graphics processor unit) the same as your motherboard uses a CPU. if you dont' have a dedicated graophics card then your computer has to utilize some of the RAM on your PC to support video functions. you may notice that you will have 1gig of memory but the system may detect less. its because some of it has been borrowed to be used for video. <br>  a good rule of thumb with any computer hardware is you get what you pay for. more RAM is good, yes, but not the deciding factor. try and get one with a high core and clock frequency. go to Newegg.com and look at all the cards they have and read the reviews for each. you will notice some have tons of great reviews. well thos would be good candidates wouldn't they?|`|kAi14kKxaa	RAM is RAM -- not graphics memory. The more RAM you have, the better your computer will perform.<br>  <br>  When purchasing a computer, don't worry about the initial RAM you get because RAM is very cheap ($20 per GB) and it is something you can upgrade yourself.<br>  <br>  VRAM (video RAM) is something else. It's expensive, and  not upgradeable, so when you make the purchase be sure that it is what you want. You can't improve it later on.<br>  <br>  The one you should be looking at is the video card.<br>  There are 2 types of video cards - integrated and dedicated.<br>  <br>  Integrated video cards do not have RAM of their own, so they share the RAM with the system. They are for budget computers and not capable of playing games.<br>  <br>  Dedicated video cards cost more, but are much better at handling games. You should consider 512MB of VRAM as a minimum, however if budget is a consideration, 256 is "ok" but your gameplay experience will be quite limited.<br>  <br>  Most games made in 2008-09 will require 512 MB of VRAM to be playable.|`|QTgm2ZTvaa	look at the back case of the cd case, the requirements are there ^^|`|qaacatZzaa	I would say not because it's not dedicated memory it's shared, which will be slower.

What they do is increase multitasking efficiency, allowing the system to run multiple applications without bogging down. Conventional processors can handle only one command thread at a time, so running programs must share CPU time, which slows things down considerably. Multiple-core processors, on the other hand, can process as many simultaneous command threads as they have cores. <br>  <br>  Programs that are multiple processor aware, such as Photoshop, Cubase and some games, will run faster on a dual or quad core processor, but most won't. For example, if you have a processor with two or four 2.6 gig cores, a program that isn't multiple processor aware will run the same as it would on a conventional 2.6 gig single core processor.|`|Be6oUPd5aa	Well I always see on tags how many ghz's that computer has.

Software that doesnt want to go is usually questionable (Norton anyone?)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you havent already, I'd scan for viruses, then you could try a system restore, which will remove recently installed programs if you take it back early enough.|`|ChZQZXQ9aa	program shud be in my computer  click local disk c  if screen appears  giving warning  click  you wish to procede click programs find program right click scroll to dlete click will ask if shure click yes this will send to reclycle bin/go to reclycle bin click empty reclycle bin/ than go to start menu  all programs find  progam this is a shortcut right click slect delete  will ask if sure click yes/then if you have icon  do the same on desktop/then  run a cleaner like ccleaner to remove reg entry|`|hV48lhvqaa	Find the folder you install it and delete the folder.|`|Ct2sQ5Ciaa	I would do a system restore to the time before you installed it, that should remove it.|`|wtVSTuSuaa	First try Jajo's advice.

2SSA9e9Naa	There are 2 types of document interfaces, single and multi. Multi-document means the software can have open more than one document, and there is a window (aka form) that presents each document for the user to view and modify. Like Word or excel.<br>  <br>  In an SDI interface there is only one document open and only one form for the user to view and modify. If the user opens another document the current one is closed.<br>  <br>  Note: In either model there can be other files open that the software is using, but it is the main user document that gives the perspective. For example, if you create an editor that modifies a .log file, you may also open a configuration file (ini) to keep options in.<br>  <br>  Make sense?
8UXzYsNoaa	You are asking a question that takes people years to learn because it is very broad.  Nothing wrong with that, just wanted to let you know that you are asking for a lot of information.  There are lots and lots of websites out there that you can learn these things from.  W3schools is great for PhP and HTML.  Web security is a huge field - you can find lots of information about this out on the web as well.  If I were you, I'd probably go to the library and get some sort of Websites for Dummies book that can help you with that information.  It should give you the answers that you need in a minimum amount of time.<br>  <br>  Along with the information listed here, if I were you, I'd look at a content management system like Drupal or Joomla.  That way you don't need to know the HTML, CSS, PhP code in detail - all you need to do is set it up and then make sure it is secure.  Usually there are documents that will walk you through the steps to do that.<br>  <br>  You can always set up an instance on your own computer - you'll need to download a webserver (Apache is free) then you can set it up - or you can host it using a web hosting service, like InMotion.<br>  <br>  Or better yet, if you just want a simple website, use OfficeLive (www.officelive.com) - it is free, run by Microsoft, and you just need to point and click to build the website.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Security is such a large subject that there are people who do nothing but make sure that a site is constantly secure.  But look into things like SQL injection, hashing (and salting) passwords, cross-site attacks.  There are books you can buy on securing websites.  Large books.  Or do a web search on website security (ignore the paid ads).|`|rH31CwjMaa	<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/</a>|`|jEbIbs1Maa	Hii Dear..<br>  <br>  Look you can Develop a Website by using HTML, JavaScript,PHP Languages, or by the softwares like DreamWeaver and Microsoft Front Page.. and then you can purchase a Domain name and Domain Space and then you can upload your Website on the Webspace..<br>  <br>  A new website dones not have too much threats as it is.. newer to the world...

hOSOawRHaa	It's possible of course, if you dedicate yourself to the technology. There are several very good books out that can assist you in your quest. My advice is to go to a local book store and check out a MAC bible, it will tech you everything you need to know about the software, you seem to know the hardware from working with pc's. The main difference is that MAC's are designed to run specific hardware configs, this is why they are so reliable. In other words, the OS is written specifically for the hardware used, unlike pc's. Windows is designed to operate on a wide array of hardware, and run various windows compatible softwares, creating a very unstable operating environment.

5MUeFvh4aa	Most video websites, such as YouTube, use Flash for their videos. A lot of people have problems with the Adobe Flash browser plugin. The most common problem is that the sound is not working. Below you can find 10 solutions for Flash related sound problems.<br>  <br>     1. Flash stores its files in a temporary files folder. A corrupt download can cause the sound problems.<br>  <br>        Delete the following folders:<br>        C:\Documents and Settings\%UserName%\Application Data\Adobe\Flash Player<br>        C:\Documents and Settings\%UserName%\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash Player<br>  <br>     2. Empty your temporary internet files.<br>  <br>        Internet Explorer: Tools -> Internet Options<br>        Firefox: Tools -> Clear Private Data<br>        Opera: Tools -> Delete Private Data<br>  <br>     3. Empty your temporary files folder.<br>  <br>        Use this command to empty your temporary files folder:<br>        Start -> Run -> RMDIR /S /Q "%TEMP%"<br>  <br>     4. Install the latest version of the Flash plugin. You can download it HERE. If you have problems upgrading the plugin, then uninstall your existing version first with this tool. Close your browser(s) before you run the uninstall tool.<br>  <br>     5. Run the K-Lite Codec Tweak Tool. Near the top you should see an option to fix the sound (Midi, WaveOut). Select that and press Next. If the option is greyed out, then that particular registry fix is not needed.<br>  <br>     6. Go to the Flash Player Settings Manager website. Click HERE.<br>        Check the box called "Allow third-party Flash content to store data on your computer."<br>  <br>     7. Check if your sound device settings are correct:<br>        Start -> Settings -> Control Panel -> Sound and Audio Devices -> Audio<br>  <br>     8. If you have QuickTime installed, then go to the QuickTime control panel. On the Audio tab, set "Default Music Synthesizer" to "General MIDI".<br>        On the Advanced tab, disable "Enable playback of Adobe Flash tracks".<br>        On the browser tab, click on "MIME Settings". Under "Miscellaneous", make sure "Flash media" is unchecked.<br>  <br>     9. Check if the file msacm32.drv is present in your Windows system32 folder. If not, copy it from another PC (that has the same version of Windows) and place the file in the system32 folder.<br>  <br>    10. If you are also having sound problems with other applications, then re-installing your audio drivers might solve the problem.|`|E9u93RVoaa	turn on your speakers.

Probably. <br>  <br>  Is this a good idea?  No.  Suppose you decided to copy eBay.  Who would use your site rather than eBay and why?<br>  <br>  As far as updating every day is concerned - you aren't going to get money by sitting and staring at your screen.  If there is no reason for people to visit your site they will go elsewhere.  Attracting hits is hard work, converting hits into real money is even harder work.<br>  <br>  People can and do make money out of websites.  They come up with something fresh and original and then work very hard to get traffic.   Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.|`|8UXzYsNoaa	Depends on how complicated it is.  See if you can duplicate it for free using OfficeLive (you can get a free site there).  You can even use Yahoo Business - but in my opinion - that costs too much.  But if it is way too complicated for that, and you really don't know how to do it, you should probably consider getting a professional to help you.<br>  <br>  Websites are almost always good to have - most people (like me) use websites to investigate businesses.  If a business that I'm interested in doesn't have a website, I immediately think it is a "small fry" operation and I might not do business with them.  As long as you don't copy the wording and logo it is ok to copy the structure of the site.  Companies do that all of the time.<br>  <br>  If it requires updating every day, you need to find a way to do it without having to pay someone else to do it.<br>  <br>  I don't know anything else about your website, so I can't help you, but you can email me if you have more questions and I'll try to help.
MxculX2Daa	Could be a bunch of stuff.<br>  <br>  Like - overheating, bad RAM stick, failing processor, motherboard problems, driver compatibility problems, badly configured hardware causing recource conflict, and more......<br>  <br>  If it was me the first thing I would try is:<br>  <br>  Remove the side panel and run the PC without it on. (assuming it is a desktop). This will radically drop the temperature inside the case. If its a heat issue then this will make it run without crashing - or run for longer. <br>  <br>  Take the RAM out and put it back in again. Make sure all the cards are seated properly.<br>  <br>  Look in the windows event viewer (in control panel, administrative tools) to see if an event is logged before reboot. Google the event log entry.<br>  <br>  Or take it to a technician and let them puzzle it out....|`|RX4y2zkMaa	Could be over heating problem, common cause for random reboots or the power unit is starting to fail.<br>  If its over 3 years old Thats what im guessing.

Compared with your 100 Mbps network connection, it's like having a 4 foot diameter pipe in your home, but your house is connected to the Internet by a drinking straw.<br>  <br>  Your best answer on faster uTorrent (or any Internet) speeds is to get a better high speed Internet connection. It will cost more.<br>  <br>  You should also remember that upload speeds are normally a fraction of download speeds, so if there are only one or two people seeding the file you wish to download, you may be limited by their upload speeds.|`|o9Xq0rOlaa	Sorry your speed is what you get from your internet provider you get your speed from the number of seeders you get, generally more seeders less leechers, ive had speeds of up to 1200 down, just pick and choose your torrents, and you should enable encryption on utorrent.|`|NwxPFAUSaa	First of all try an internet accelerator like Internet Cyclone to optimize your internet speed.

KHSOVxViaa	What do you need to solve?<br>  <br>  The only potential problem I see is when you compare (x == 1.1).  It may depend on the numeric precision of your compiler.  The way floats are stored cannot be precise; 1.1 may be stored as 1.09999999 or similar.<br>  <br>  Because of this you're best to stick to integer compares (if possible), else test for within boundaries e.g. (x <= 1.10001 && x >= 1.09999) or whatever.<br>  <br>  BTW your loop will only execute once;  when the value changes, the compare will be false.  Maybe you should use (x >= 0) ?|`|FOR5nWG7aa	give the sign of float and recheck ur code|`|xzRXFkvnaa	You will never get into the loop because c compiler never gives you exact precision on float values.

3XMCQ4Spaa	Yes, Gas is the same as GNU assembler.  It's part of the binutils package, and can be downloaded at <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/" rel="nofollow">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/</a> (together with many other tools, like the GNU linker).  Mind you, it's intended to run under Unix-like operating systems, like Linux (where it's included by default due to dependencies).<br>  <br>  It's not good for beginners, as it's intended more to be used as a backend by GCC (GNU compiler collection) than as a stand-alone by people, and therefor make some assumptions -- like that you know what you're doing and that you don't need verbose error-messages.<br>  <br>  NASM (<a href="http://www.nasm.us/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.nasm.us/)</a> is better suited for actually writing programs manually in, and it's available for Windows also.|`|KtQdOqHKaa	GNU as is a part of the binutils package at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/</a><br>  <br>  I don't believe that it is the same as gas.

More ram up to 2 gigs can help a computer, but for the average user you wont notice a performance gain above 2 gigs.  Also windows 32 bit wont support over 3-4 gigs.

lJNiCNyKaa	In most languages, including C, the same three random numbers will be generated. That is, C always seeds the random number generator with the same starting number.     Therefore, first,  the function "randomize()" may be used to seed the random number generator with a number which is developed from the system clock, which of course, is always changing.|`|AA10929108	its for generating random numbers of course    sometimes in video games events are triggered at random  so random numbers need to be generated|`|KKnIJI04aa	A computer has a VERY difficult time creating a truely random number.  This is because everything the computer does is based on fact, and calculations that come from facts.    Using a function like randomize() tells the computer to come up with a new "seed" for creating what is actually a "pseudo-random" number.  This seed is used to create the (what looks like a) random number.    The resulting pseudo-random number is good enough for most situations where a random number is needed.    Using randomize() occassionally throughout your calculations helps to improve the "randomness", as it re-seeds the random number generator with a new number, typically from the computer's clock.

The mouse shouldn't be clicked while in the C++ App. There should be a symbol indicating that it is ready for the next action.

ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.    There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.    Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network. Read more on the dangers of proxy's below.|`|6Xreht4Qaa	There's new proxies every day on :    http://www.pr0xyblog.com    Be sure to tell your friends, and post it to your myspace page or blog, so others can enjoy ;-)    Happy Surfing !|`|FgsRcuDpaa	Let's first establish: Myspace is not a requirement.  There is nothing that important on Myspace that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences; that you really don't want to. It's honestly not worth the repercussions involved.  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time.    Schools/Work block them not only because of the drama it brings, but additionally because of the viruses it can contain, horror stories of persons getting harmed through a stranger over Myspace, etc.|`|SzzfrJHxaa	You can give this proxy a try to unblock those blocked websites; it works like a charm!    http://surfbabe.info    Be sure to tell your friends about it so they too can enjoy.

BmQDvc6Caa	You can check with your university to see if they have a recommendation. Most do these days. You need to ask your self what you will be doing with the laptop. Just school work(which may dictate what kind of system you get), internet, games, entertainment (DVD, streaming videos). Once you can narrow down this info your choice should rise to the top of your list. Now I am not a mac person so I would say go with the PC.     Pros:  PCs have a larger support community   MAC is a better product period. But I would not get it just to have it. Make sure you will use the system    Cons:  Low end Dells are well... cheap PCs   MAC cost     I would go with the Dell and make sure you have a backup copy of you important files.|`|72DBWVBOaa	i have dell pc and macbook well pc is really good and at moderate speed and dell is fast and macbook doent really load that fast|`|IEe0yhE4aa	If you are a nuthead who has no clue about computers, please by all means get a MacBook; it'll do IT and everyone on campus a favor.  The only reason why Macs have so few viruses is simply because of the very tight integration between hardware and software.  This works to Apple's advantage in that it bundles hardware and software and can have a nice hefty markup, but in Windows, you can mix and match nearly 100% of the hardware out there today and have it work with Windows (which is why machines with Windows are cheaper because you can use cheapter hardware).  However, if you do have experience with computers, like me, and know the advantages of having a Windows installation (better support all around, nearly 90% of the computer market uses it, and most of the software is either built specifically or first for the Windows platform, Mac comes secondary...if ever), please by all means go with the Dell.  Dell offers the superior value in hardware and often is much better than any comparable Apple computer, but Apple computers are purportedly more user-friendly and "secure" (yeah right...).  I find this to be not the case with the advent of Windows Vista and the upcoming Windows 7, but the ultimate judgement rests with you.    There are also plenty of Dell coupons floating around all over the place!  I think it's a great time to buy a Dell machine.  It is a much better value than anything Apple can offer.

SyR2ZlMHaa	Just a thought - there have been a lot of people working from home and kids idle with schools shut in the 'cold' spell. It could be that the contention rate on the kit at the exchange is poor.  Alternatively, is there some kit like an electric fan heater being plugged in which could be interfering though the power? I have heard that this kit can be excessively sensitive.  It is possible that there is a line fault, especially if you are out in the sticks and there are airial cables strung on poles feeding to where you are.   Suggest you start by unplugging everything from the phone sockets all over the house to rule out a faulty splitter of other kit.

My Fios router went bad 2 months ago. desktop PCs were fine, but  I kept having the wireless signal drop. They sent me a new one and now it is great.    But do not assume it is just the router. Call your ISP either way and they can send a Tech to run signal tests, etc. If they supplied your router it is usually a free replacement, but if it is yours and you go buy another one & it turns out to be something else, you will be mad.    Have them check everything with the current router to isolate the problem.

LFWWPgpQaa	Xbox Live communications are Encrypted, I believe with DES.  All communications going between the 360 and the Live servers will be almost impossible to monitor.    The only way I could see it being done would be to run a DNS poison (or just have it going through a hub (so all packets goto your PC) the 360 so that you can perform a man in the middle attack and have all data going back and forth passed through your machine.    From there I suppose you might be able to see what was going on if you captured the initial handshake packets.  DNS Poisoning and packet sniffing is simple using things like wireshark, particuly if your the admin but the decryption part is beyond me to be frank.

7aqEtfLRaa	Firefox is better than IE, it checks websites against a list before it loads the page and blocks it if it knows it's bad. Plus you can get adblock plus, which gets rid of ads.|`|eg9wjUQ7aa	Firefox. If you mom doesn't trust you, get the WOT, or web of trust addon for firefox. This will warn you by displaying a warning screen over the website, and you can choose to either close it, or navigate the page. Good Luck!|`|NkhblCaSaa	Firefox is better because internet explorer refuses to comply with the W3C standards.    You could also try Google Chrome.|`|ntaiKOW8aa	I agree that Firefox is safer for the most part.  It's not quite as heavily targeted as Internet Explorer, it usually does a pretty good job of reporting sites that are known to cause problems, and there are a bunch of add-ons you can add to it (like the other user mentioned).    If by "bad websites" you mean content-wise, like blocking violence, porn, or language, or something like that, it won't do that automatically.  That will require a separate product.    However, really, security comes down to the user... so I would recommend educating your sister on common traps marketers use on the Internet, so she knows what's safe and not safe to click on.

I don't think you could get into any REAL trouble unless you make it for a profit (since you are posting it on YouTube I doubt it's for a profit). Mattel could easily send you a letter to stop production, but who knows.

OH11eyWBaa	Yes, as long as the interface is the same (IDE/SATA). These aren't mac/PC specific interfaces, but SATA is newer than IDE. This just means they connect to the motherboard differently -- SATA has smaller cords and transmits data faster.<br>  <br>  Also, you'll have to format the hard drive before installing Windows on it. Do this while it's still in the Mac. Once it's in the desktop, you can change the boot order in BIOS to the new hard drive, but it needs an OS installed.<br>  <br>  Edit: I just read where you said LAPTOP hard drive. Laptop hard drives are smaller than desktop hard drives, thus they won't properly fit in the hard drive bay for a desktop unless you buy some sort of converter kit. Also, laptop hard drives tend to have a lower RPM, so they might run a bit slower.<br>  <br>  Something like this: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817994064" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  It'd probably be more cost effective and easier just to buy a new hard drive, haha.|`|AA10459818	NO, , the mac os is looking for mac hard where and wont recognize ur windows hardware.

uAOkRBA0aa	malwarebytes is digging them out,   avast will not be aware of them until they start to move   or become active.  if you had done a boot time scan with avast it would have found them.        ?|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Malwarebytes is not a virus maker, it is a virus flusher !    The rule of thumbs for security is to have a multi-layered protection approach !    So do not use more than one virus scanner on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one good cleaner, two or three Anti Adware/Spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one) but have at least one of each (for security).     You can only use one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one) but, if you have a router, you can also activate its built-in Firewall as they use different methods.      Here are my suggestions for free software you can mix and match to your liking according to the rule (I tried all personally):    Anti-Malware/Spyware/Adware scanners suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.    Virus scanners suggestions:    Don't go for AVG free, it may be free but it has hiccups like the error that made the news late last year on CNET, it advised to remove a key component of Windows causing those who did to lose the use of their Windows system.    Avast is good but takes a lot of resources in the computer.    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender.     Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not. Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.     If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall (or don't want a Firewall) then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.    However, it does not include Email, Malware, Spyware or Adware scanners so complement by choosing from other suggestions on this page    Email scanner suggestions:    Spamdel: http://www.spamdel.com/    OR    Inbox: http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi...    Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|2FAXWV6faa	MalwareBytes AntiMalware and Avast AntiVirus are 2 different programs that dont work together.  They both help detect and remove malware, so whatever malwarebytes find it quarantines, and whatever avast finds it quarantines (send to the chest)|`|kDrjtu0Saa	Malware bytes are baaaaaad

zorYTX59aa	YouTube does not permit any HTML, VB or IMG codes in descriptions,  messages, emails, or comments. As such, there are several symbols  and characters from among   % ^ * = { } [ ] | / \  that can't be used.   Check to see whether you're using symbols like these, and then leave   them out altogether.    Two other common characters that YouTube many times confuses for  those codes are quotation marks (" ") and ampersands (&). If you use  either of them within your channel and video descriptions, they run the   risk of badly expanding themselves into terribly long and awful streaks   of "quot&,quot&,quot&,quot&," and "amp&,amp&,amp&,amp&,amp&,"    Even Yahoo!Answers is susceptible to this. Often times, you may see  something like "&  39;" instead of an apostrophe ( ' ).    Also possible is that you might be using "leader lines" -- which means   too many repeats of things like periods, hyphens and colons. Starting   a line with something like "............." will not be accepted by YouTube.    If you're trying to create or cut-&-paste fancy "ASCII art" in your profile,  don't try to put it into "My Account" >> "Channel Info" >> "Description".  It also wont work with "My Account" >> "Profile Setup" >> "Interests".  Instead, include it into "My Account" >> "Profile Setup" >> "About Me".    I hope that my information and answer are at least a bit helpful for you.|`|2fWVQ4itaa	It says that because you have written to much and it cant save...trust me it happens to me all the time you either have  to delete something to make it fit or out it in a different box|`|1af70b29b0658f71949900c49fa7ec95aa	just make another account...

yb5i5QpQaa	Unfortunately you can't do this in uTorrent.  When Limewire downloads a file it downloads it from beginning to end.  When uTorrent downloads a file it does it in packs to speed up the process.  Meaning if you are at 50% on Limewire you've downloaded the first half of the movie.  If uTorrent is at 50% on a download it's downloaded ANY part of that file up to 50% complete.  So it could be the middle 25% and the last 25% to make up the 50%.  Until uTorrent gets to 100% there are too many holes in the file to be previewed.   It's faster this way because you can download multiple packets at once but doesn't allow you to preview.|`|Hc82C7Lyaa	right click > open containing folder

GnYw9Pvwaa	Alienware is good, Dell is good, but I swear that Falcon Northwest makes the most solid computers you'd ever find.    If you're willing to pay, Falcon Northwest makes computers that will withstand the apocalpyse, I just suggest if you get one not to screw around with its cards and swap them or anything, because they are built just right, and if you flop anything around they don't like it. The makers made them right, never try and unprofessionally change anything in any computer you get. Also for the computer's sake I recommend XP because Vista causes tons of problems.|`|ElvQTpUVaa	Prior to being bought by Dell, AW purchased their computers as barebones kits made by other companies - uniwill, sager, etc.  These companies were not as well known in the US as AW, so many AW customers didn;t know that they could have spent less buying directly from those manufacturers, and would have had better buyer protection.  (If the manufacturer ended support for a line of notebooks sold as the Area-51M, there was little AW could do to keep spare parts available).    You still pay a premium for AW, and I haven't heard stories about how their product support has become much better.

Most likely it wasn't facebook but just a virus sent via internet. And why it says Ricky Ponting is a questionable thing it could mean that how the guy set up the virus or it was Ricky himself (although i don't know the guy or if he should do it or anything like that of course). Well that's my best answer to your concern i wouldn't worry about it to much though, unless your computer continues to have problems.

I think the above address is right but get someone to go on linksys's site to confirm it, just click on support and type in the routers serial or model number.    as far as i know there isn't any real way to shorten the range of a router all you can do is while your in settings is set up wireless security, it won't stop people seeing you but it will stop them using you as a route to the internet. happy surfing    just remembered don't forget to write down your password when you reset it.  also the password to get into the router will probably be something like admin admin, or admin password. hope that helps|`|PP8tKxYdaa	hold the black butten in the back of the rutor than it will reset to factory defalts

tBnJqnZDaa	I like WordPress because there's hardly any ads there.    I'm not sure but I've heard and think there is a fee with TypePad ($30-60 a year, I think.)    Blogger is free and is pretty good also.    I've never used LiveJournal, but my friends do and they love it!
pUzJiMUcaa	Try adding .ToString() in the first one, like this: <br>  <br>  If country Is cbxCountries.SelectedItem.ToString() Then<br>  <br>  SelectedItem is an object, country is a string. If you want it to fly, pull the string property out of the object. That should get er goin.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Strike last...I read through too quickly.<br>  <br>  Another big difference in the second one is that it breaks the for loop when the If statement is hit.<br>  <br>  In the first one, it asks "Does this country match the selected on? If yes, pop up a message box and loop to the next country. If no, add the selected country to the country list"<br>  <br>  In the second one, it says "Does the selected item match the current item in the list that we're looping for? If yes, stop looping and set the selected property to true. If no, continue to the end...when we hit the end, if the country was not selected, it adds it to the list.<br>  <br>  In the first one, every loop that does NOT match the selected country adds the selected country to the list. So if there are 2 countries in the list, and neither of them match the selected country, the selected item should be added twice...if I'm reading this right. If one matches, then it would STILL be added, since the loop will come around twice, and hit the ELSE statement on one of those times. So you're problem then, is that it's adding the selected country, no matter what, I assume...<br>  <br>  That's because every loop either adds the selected item, or warns that the item was already selected. One of those two always happens. In the second loop, it either warns that it was selected, or skips it. If it never warns, it adds it AFTER the loop completes.
GnYw9Pvwaa	Your problem might be that your stuff just isn't compatible, and that often is because of software. You might want to update your sound card and your hard drive, also make certain you installed your microphone correctly if it has a CD. Also be aware if your microphone post dates your computer, which you would know better than I, it just may be impossible. Also power might be a problem. Often computers have thousands of tasks and the attempt to run a show like this may be too much for it, and also because the computer was not made for this type of interfacing more than likely. You see, computers don't generally like this kind of stuff because of their make, so may be the computer's fault. If you have a wicked laptop that is supposed to be da bomb for all of this stuff you're doing then I suggest calling technical support and ask there: either the computer maker or the microphone maker.|`|zzvDybEiaa	You might want to  ( if you haven't already) right click on the speaker in the toolbar, and make sure that all sources are un muted.

ntaiKOW8aa	While you are paying a bit of a premium for an Apple computer, I would say that it's not just a blatant rip off, you are paying specifically for a couple things:  1) The Operating System -- if you like Mac OS X, you can only get it on a Apple computer.  There's no legal way of putting that OS on a PC.  2) The software -- there is software that is Mac-only, like the iLife suite that comes with every Mac that is easily worth hundreds of dollars.  3) Tight Hardware-Software integration -- since Apple is in control of both the hardware and software production, they can guarantee the performance and compatibility of the different pieces.  Also, all of the software can tightly be integrated into the OS and each other.    However, if you don't care about Mac OS X, or you prefer windows, or you don't have a specific need that points to Mac's strengths, there's definitely no reason to spend the extra money.  Just like everything else, it has its strengths and weaknesses.|`|CFE4F3eUaa	With Apple, you have to take into account design.

There is A LOTin this firewall to go over.  if you are installing programs or updating windows the program can be set to installation mode which will learn all changes but will not alert you...wen finished change it back to "previous mode"|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	The latest version is Comodo Firewall 3.0.25.378, which should work OK for you. If that won't run on your pc then Comodo Firewall 2.4.18.184 is the last of the old versions. It's a very good two-way firewall but the constant pop-ups asking what you want to do may drive you mad. It does settle down but it's still quite 'chatty'.     That's due to the Defense+ feature, or HIPS, which pops up whenever anything tries to install on your pc. If it's something you are deliberaltely installing you can disable it before you start. The trick is to remember to re-start Defense+ when you've installed it. If it's not something you want to install, e.g. spyware installing itself surreptitiously, then that's where Defense+ is a real winner.    OnlineArmor works in a very similar way but is a lot more user-friendly (and also free).    Firewall test results:  http://www.matousec.com/projects/firewal...

Comodo has also an anti virus program, but I would recommend this    Comodo Internet Security  ( free )    http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/    As extra protection I would install these 2 free programs      Threatfire is an anti virus, that can be installed next to any other anti virus program on the same computer  http://www.threatfire.com/      This is a very good program, that completely runs in the background  http://www.comodo.com/boclean/boclean.ht...

Threatfire can be used with any other anti virus program|`|RoMxIa1Jaa	You've already gotten some good info.

LivePCSupport        * Security & Protection Services      * Setup and Installation      * PC Tune-up and Green Configuration      * Computer & Printer Troubleshooting    Comodo firewall is a top contender.     The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing. Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.     If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, choose combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall, that choice is yours too.      Get it here: http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/i...    The paid (Pro) version is on the right.|`|tOCESHLYaa	Yes it is as good as advertised. But you will need to spend some time learning how to use it. It comes with good help files. If you make rules for all your programs comodo won't bug you as much. Once you have it set up and all your rules set it should run smooth. Defense plus is what makes it strong, without it, the protection is not as strong. Remember it's not only a firewall but also has  strong HIPS protection.|`|H0gEUeNjaa	Yes it is Good to use Comodo firewall pro Comodo Firewall Pro - Secure your system against internal attacks such as Trojan viruses / malicious software and external attacks by hackers. Safeguard your personal data through a simple user friendly single click interface offering full immunity to attack.

jHuIwZl8aa	Hi    Make sure the software you are using is set to Large format. If you installed the correct drivers , when you go to the preferences or page layout, you should see Super B which is the 13x19 or Large format setting.    Secondly, you can print borderless on 13 x 19 and for borderless printing, you can use a slider to specify how far to enlarge the image to cover the page borders. However, it lacks an interactive preview, so you won't be able to see where the new image borders will lie.    You can print 12 x 18 full bleed. This will give you a 1/4" margin all around but it's better than nothing LOL.    Also, set the correct orientation of your paper. Usually in large format, you have to use landscape in your graphic software. Then use the printer settings to print it in portrait.    The main problem is your software and not the printer. Finally, the drawback to this printer is that it can reliably feed only one 13 x 19 at a time.|`|812793fbbb1f4d6a8b07ee04d74ebb7daa	In borderless printing, margins in the printable area are set to 0 mm.  (The paper sizes usable with borderless printing are A4, Letter, 4"x6", and 5"x7" only.)  Other wise you will load your paper the same way|`|AA11296044	Make sure that in all your settings and page layouts you have your sizing set to super B3.

"lots of memory" and "fast" come with a cost.    ASUS makes the f8 series though it can be $1300. They make rock solid computers of you can keep external crap out of them like funky reworks, swapping operating systems, cards, etc. Don't ever change security features. DO NOT GET VISTA. GET XP. VISTA=TROUBLE, WHAT EVER YOU DO. MOST COMPUTER PROBLEMS I'VE HAD, WHICH ARE MANY, CAME FROM VISTA ISSUES.    ASUS's computers and laptop are great solo, they won't bust. Period. Falcon Northwest is great too, but they can be costly. They are solid. Dell makes great computers though they lack in the speed and gaming category.     You cannot get a computer like the one your asking for 600 dollars, you just won't. A decent laptop maybe, but nothing you'll be dancing the dance of joy for, espeically in the speed section.    Fast computers start at $1000, if you buy cheaper, you're liable to hurt yourself in the end, because they aren't always what they appear to be.

f3c9284e72a9e7b4cac315d3e02c5ddfaa	Alright man, here is the low-down...    XP is a good operating system, except for SP3.  I run dual boot on my desktop because I have XP Pro SP2 on one HD and Vista Ultimate on another.  If you are considering Vista, first rule, DONT BUY BASIC! My wife's laptop came with Vista Basic and it sucked worse than Windows 98.  I myself have taken a liking to Vista Ultimate tho, It has a nice GUI, very clean, and run very smooth on my desktop, which is a Pentium D 3.2GHz, 2GB DDR2, 512MB nVidia PCIe video.  The only downfall I have found with Vista is that it doesnt not like my Palm Treo 700w phone, which is why I keep XP installed.  Now my wifes laptop, I got the beta version of Windows 7, and that is actually a really nice OS as well.  So in short, if you are going to use Vista, spend the extra $$ on Ultimate, or wait it out until Windows 7 comes out.|`|N6KeBAboaa	Vista is awesome!|`|R10eB91uaa	Really simple.  Old computer=XP  New computer=Vista  New computer with XP= STUPID|`|USieFKIcaa	Stick with XP bro. Vista sucks. The only reason I have it is because it came with my new computer. I continue to have problems with it. Usually have new problems whenever an update comes out. Windoes Vista looks better with new backgrounds and a sidebar thing with an analog clock but generally it will slow down your computer and its harder to use. Its up to you but most people I have talked to agree that Vista sucks. I hear a new one is coming out anyway. (Windows Vienna?)    I have windows vista home premium and it barely ran on 1 gig. had to upgrade to 2.5.|`|1Jm1bHplaa	I use Vista on my parents PC which has 1 G of memory and I have to say that I find it slower than my ancient PC with 254 M and XP.

Oh, I know!  They are crying because their ancient hardware doesn't run on VISTA nor their ancient games and they are too cheap to upgrade/update and enter the 21st century.    They probably still drive model T Fords too..    Or they were too cheap to go for 3 GB MEM and got VISTA basic too.|`|2eb3b10f915c12af5f46e8e87c404752aa	Your question is 2 years late! You can't compare a brand new OS with a dying one. Of course some "knowledgeable" people are in love with XP still due to learning disability|`|vqSkfztOaa	Well I had a regular xp computer, but for Christmas I got a laptop with Vista. I have to say, its awesome. The only problem is with pictures. Vista is a TERRIBLE photo organizer. You have to continuously put pictures in the correct folder. But other than that, its the best! I downloaded Picasa 3 to help manage my pictures, plus I'm very organized, so its not really a problem for me. I'm never using my old hunk-of-junk computer again, though!|`|ssbkAyWJaa	When i used to use Vista, i mainly use Windows 7 instead, it was great! The thing that is annoying for most users is uninstalling all the bloatware that is installed on their computers when they purchase them. Once you get rid of all the useless programs and do maintenance often, it runs good. The main reason why people say Vista sucks is because their computer can't handle all the things that Vista requires to run. SP1 fixed most of the issues.     Now that Windows 7 is out and soon to be SP2, it's going to be way better. I almost find SP2 pointless, but for those who plan on staying on Vista because Windows 7 is still in its beta stage, it really isn't. You should try Windows 7 out and see what you think about it.    I would recommend you reading the system requirements before installing either Vista or Windows 7. You will need at least 2GB for it to run smoothly on Vista & Windows 7.    Vista: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows...    Windows 7: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows...|`|cLzxtmpCaa	I used to have xp and now i am running my computer on vista 64- bit.  I think by all means you SHOULD NOT GET VISTA.  there are countless problems with it such as security, using to many resources on the operating system itself, software compatibility, game issues, internet issues, crashing, driver issues,  the list goes on and on.    I myself am a die-hard MICROSOFT user and hate MAC.  If I were you I would either wait for Windows 7 (next windows operating system) or Stick with xp

JdlkhEayaa	I can only say what I did.  I had McAfee and when it was time to renew I downloaded the removal tool from their website to remove all remnants of the programme before installing the new CD.  Up to you how you go about it but it worked fine for me by doing it this way.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	If you want to be extra sure of starting clean, you SHOULD remove the old one completely.    Here is the proper 3-steps (or 4-steps) way to do it:    NOTE: After you have downloaded and installed the programs in steps 1 & 2 and before doing the removal, temporarily unplug the Internet connection !    1) Use Revo Uninstaller ( http://www.revouninstaller.com/ ) - an innovative freeware uninstall utility that will fully remove the old Virus scanner with its advanced and fast algorithm.    Revo Uninstaller analyzes an application's data before uninstall and scans after you uninstall an application.     After the program's regular uninstaller runs, you can remove additional unnecessary files, folders and registry keys that are usually left over on your computer.     Even if you have a broken installation, Revo Uninstaller scans for an application's data on your hard disk drives and in the Windows registry and shows all found files, folders and registry keys so you can delete them.     2) Use Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files, remnants of installs/uninstalls and orphan registry entries (there is always some).    3) Use your preferred Disk Defragmenter.      Additional step to do if your new protection includes a Firewall    4) Disable the existing one.      Reboot and then install the new protection from the CD.    Adjust its options and finally, plug back the Internet connection      Hope this helps|`|AA11256390	If you are getting an anti virus from the same company then it should uninstall the original automatically.

If it doesn't remove the original automatically then before you run a scan go to add/remove programs and remove it|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	If you plan to upgrade an existing program then the new version should over-write the old version but leave any preferences, e.g. time of scans, etc, in place. However, I'd prefer to uninstall the old version and start again.    If you're changing from, say, McAfee to Norton, then you definitely need to uninstall the old one. You *should* be able to uninstall OK via Add/Remove Programs but some programs don't uninstall cleanly and the bits they leave behind can really mess up installation of the next AV, so the best bet is to Google for "uninstall (name of program)" and see if there's a special uninstaller from the maker, then run that.    I prefer to have it on CD but, to be honest, it doesn't make much difference.

c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	There's nothing wrong with your ipod. It says "Do Not Disconnect" when you attach it to the computer, to protect the software from getting damaged. This is a normal part of having an ipod. If you disconnect while it says that, you can mess up the programs and the songs will play goofy (I've done this before). The only way to fix messed up ipod software is to reinstall the program it uses, which will wipe out it's memory and lose all your songs (GRR that sucks too!)     To disconnect your ipod, make sure that your ipod music list is highlighted in iTunes, then find the button that says "disconnect ipod" or something like that, (my button is at the bottom of iTunes, but yours may be different depending on the version you have).

B73lQMXaaa	TRY THIS . . .  1) Go to download.com  2) Download MalwareBytes  3) Run a quick scan  4) Remove what it finds|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Antivirus 2010 is itself a virus. Of course it won't uninstall.    You can try using virus removal software to get it off (a lot of people here recommend MalwareBytes, which is worth a shot).    If that doesn't work, reinstall Windows and use better security in the future.    Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups.

Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link.  Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!

XmnVJxzaaa	I found the specifications for your system:<br>  <a href="http://support.packardbell.com/uk/item/index.php?pn=PB13202001&g=1400" rel="nofollow">http://support.packardbell.com/uk/item/i...</a><br>  According to the Packard-Bell website, you do have an AGP port available on your motherboard. It operates at AGP 4X/2X speeds (or AGP version 2.0).<br>  Not all AGP ports have the keys to which you are referring. There is such a things as a Universal AGP slot*. That must be what you have.<br>  While the AGP slot is older, there are a few cards still made for that interface. The best AGP graphics card available is the ATI Radeon HD 3850. Several different manufacturers make graphics cards using the HD 3850 graphics processor. Here is a list:<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=40000048+1069609639&Configurator=&Subcategory=48&description=hd+3850&Ntk=&SpeTabStoreType=&srchInDesc=" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductLis...</a><br>  One of the most important things to keep in mind when shopping for a graphics card is the specifications of your power supply. I wasn't able to find the specification of your power supply online, so you will have to check them yourself. You will need to open your case and check the little sticker on the side of the power supply. It will look something like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.bcchardware.com/gallery/albums/X2-750W/PSULabel.sized.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bcchardware.com/gallery/album...</a><br>  The label is usually on the facing the panel you remove, so it should be easy to find. What you are looking for on the label is the maximum Watts. <br>  Once you have the maximum Watts, you can head out (or online) and find a card that will work on your system. The HD 3850 I mentioned earlier needs at least a 450 Watt power supply. Something decent that has lower power supply requirements is the ATI Radeon HD 3650. It's a little slower than the 3850, but needs only a 300 W power supply. Again, several manufacturers make this kind of card. Either of the card I suggest would be vastly better than the dedicated graphics on your system by a HUGE margin.<br>  I hope this helps. If you need more info, please add more details to this question, or feel free to email me through my Yahoo! Answers profile.<br>  Good luck.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Not all AGP slots are keyed. Some of them can accept cards of any voltage, so they don't need keys.<br>  <br>  Here's an example of an AGP slot without keys (it's the long brown slot, just to the left of the first PCI slot):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.unicornsoft-bochum.de/DOK/mainboard/m-boards/k7s5a.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.unicornsoft-bochum.de/DOK/mai...</a><br>  <br>  Get an AGP card, preferably a Geforce or Radeon card as they're more standard and widely supported. AGP cards offer vastly better performance than PCI cards.|`|qaacatZzaa	keys? It all depends on what you want to do, for what you should get, agp is by far better than pci.

Fp0jrUtOaa	They are real and, when properly administered, they can give indications about whether a person is probably telling the truth or not.    The important caveats are   1) The test must be properly administered.  It is very easy to get it wrong and to invalidate your results.  Professional administrators require years of intensive training and experience before they can get reliable results.    2) Older tests that rely on only a few biological measures can sometimes be compromised if the person being tested is trained to do so.  Skin conductivity and heart rate can be brought under at least partial voluntary control through biofeedback training, for example.  (Newer tests usually measure multiple indicators simultaneously and tend to focus on biological indicators which are more completely controlled by the autonomic nervous system.)    3) Even in the best circumstances, they are not absolute tests.  They can determine a probability that the person believes that he/she is telling the truth but that still leaves a measurable chance of false positives and false negatives.    4) The standard is belief, not truth.  Memory has been shown to be a surprisingly malleable entity.  (Note:  This last is a criticism of all eyewitness testimony, not merely that attested to by lie detector.)     Because of all those factors, lie detector tests are generally viewed with skepticism as evidence of guilt, though they may be more accepted in court as an indicator of innocence.  (The admissibility of the tests varies by jurisdiction.)|`|PP8tKxYdaa	the dont do anythung there incrooct|`|2FAXWV6faa	How lie detectord work  - http://www.howstuffworks.com/lie-detecto...|`|7aqEtfLRaa	Lie detector tests mean nothing in court, because they're so inaccurate.

q0SenAFsaa	I am very curious why..........................    Your screen takes up A LOT of power.  Turn the brightness up all the way.    Wireless stuff are power hogs too.  Connect to a wireless router.  If your computer has Bluetooth, turn that on too.    Play games online (heavy-duty gaming like some first person shooter, not some online flash game).  Not only does the game use a lot of power, you are also sending and receiving a lot of data on the internet.    Have your CD/DVD disk drive running.  If you are playing a game, play one that requires the disk.  If you aren't gaming, play a CD or DVD.    USB devices can drain power too.  Plug in an optical mouse, a flash drive or two, and your iPod or mp3 player and have all of them running.  USB devices such as these get their power from the computer via USB.    These are some of the biggest power monsters on your computer.

bnCiNAQdaa	you have to to have a bootloader otherwise neither OS will work.  XP uses boot.ini as the bootloader.  Vista uses BCDstore (boot configuration data store) as a bootloader.    bootmgr in Vista is not a file you can remove. no bootmgr, no boot up. period.  as long as you installed XP after Vista, you should be fine with editing the boot manager w/EasyBCD. but do not select the option "Uninstall the Vista Bootloader (to restore XP)" as long as Vista is the first/primary OS that was installed.  that option is for those who have installed Vista onto an existing XP system as a 2nd OS.|`|7aqEtfLRaa	You shouldn't remove it unless you have another bootloader to take it's place, like GRUB.

Good luck!|`|rMs4WBfcaa	Download and run spybot|`|ntaiKOW8aa	First of all, what OS are you running on it?  If it's not 64-bit, your OS will never recognize more than (about) 3GB of memory... so putting in more than that won't really do much.    Like the other user stated, if your motherboard only supports 2GB, you're also out of luck without a BIOS upgrade.    So, to REALLY make it faster, I would recommend getting a 64-bit OS, either Linux, or XP 64-bit or Vista 64-bit so that you can utilize all 4GB of RAM.  Plus, a clean OS install will really speed up your computer, since Windows seems to degenerate over time.    Alternatively, you could check out what processes are running when the system first boots up, to see if there's anything unnecessary that could be slowing down your computer.  Or, try running a free malware/adware scan (like Ad-aware and/or Spybot search and destroy) to see if anything like that is slowing down your system.    One other thing you could try is running defrag, as this will also improve system performance.    Good luck!|`|wfjdYC4Iaa	Look for a BIOS update. It *might* fix your problem.

But users, that's another thing !      Just make sure you have a REAL protection plan in place !    The rule of thumbs for security is to have a multi-layered protection approach !    So do not use more than one virus scanner on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one good cleaner, two or three Anti Adware/Spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one).     You can only use one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one) but, if you have a router, you can also activate its built-in Firewall as they use different methods.    But you must have at least ONE of each for your own security.      So are you REALLY secured ?|`|zWqKuIQuaa	I dont think so unless they want to get sued.
9QBlKlFmaa	I would have added a category for kosher restaurants.      .|`|4d3Ie5lCaa	Firs of all when I hover some of the menu images don't load. Your site looks like a template, which means that it doesn't look unique.     Searching seems hard because you have too many options. You should use AJAX instead of refreshing the page every time someone searches.    The contact us page did not load.    Yes your website is amateurish, specially the fact that the  of the page does not change, it's always "Deals On Meals", this means that the only way for people to find your site using Yahoo!, Google or other search engine is if they type "Deals On Meals" and it might still be hard.    Next time you hire someone ask them to design something unique not from a template, also ask them to focus more on SEO techniques. I would design this type of website using a liquid layout rather than a fixed one.|`|7igxiGrAaa	First glance at the opening page I feel that the shadow on the box in the center makes it feel disjointed. It doesn't mesh with the rest of the layout.     I personally love the logos on the tops of your pages, it's very classy.     I would add a site map, as you have many links within links that viewers may have a hard time finding or following. A site map will list all your areas in one user-friendly page. It will also increase hits to your website through search engines.    A drop down menu bar (Spry in Dreamweaver) may also help more with the links, especially for the How it Works section, where you have numerous links within that page. For instance if I wanted to jump to FAQ and you had a drop down spry menu bar, I could just hover my mouse over How It Works and select FAQ from there, with out having to load the How it Works page.   example: http://www.heideldesign.com/ on the about us link at the top.    The search bar is a little large and in your face on all the pages, and on first look when I clicked the links I thought the page hadn't change because of the fact the search bar takes such a large focal point.    Your images took awhile to load on my laptop, I had to visit some pages twice to experience it for how it really was meant to be displayed.     Over all as a general appearance, I think the site looks nice. It's a little on the common side with the layout but overall appearance as a whole is good.

FEQMb7wIaa	It's all based on where your linked items reside in comparison to the current page. If everything was in one folder (images/html files etc.), then a link would be as simple as: Link Name    If your linked items reside somewhere else (for example, I use a folder titled "images" for my pictures inside the main folder containing my html files), then your link would look as such: Link Name. The deeper you go from the parent directory, the longer your path becomes (href="images/funny_images/image.jpg" is an example).    Finally, if your linked items are outside the parent directory, you can link back to other directories, provided everything is encompassed in your main folder. An example of such: Link Name.    The easiest method I could show you is to have all html files in one folder. Have all images inside a folder (call it "images"), and keep in inside the same folder as your html files. That way, each link keeps the same path.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	I don't know what Web Easy is, but there are two kinds of linking.    You can link to absolute paths or relative paths. If you're linking to an external website, it has to be an absolute path. If you're linking to other pages on your own website, you can use relative paths.    Let's say your website is http://www.site.com and you're trying to link to the about.html page.    If you do  Read more about me, then that's using the full (or absolute) path.    If you do Read more about me, then that's using the relative path.
ykXzzx65aa	yea u can overclock them, as long as u pervide good enough cooling|`|QYPrM3GPaa	Potentially you could overclock them, but what you are going to be confronted with, more or less, is the limitations of the old BIOS's on the motherboard and the old operating systems.  The ability to overclock will depend, in particular, on the BIOS options you have available to you.  With computers that are 10 years old, you might just encounter what was called the Y2K problem or the year 2000 problem.    This was a problem inherent in the BIOS prior to the year 2000.  The problem consists of the inability of those BIOS's to deal with turning the clock over from 19XX to 20XX.  I don't know how old you are, but if you are old enough to remember that year 2000 "scare," which was a concern at that time, that major computer systems would fail because the clock could not be turned over in BIOS...thus shutting down major governmental computer systems, crashes of the electrical grids, failure of satellites to communicate with ground stations, etc.  The US Govt spent billions of dollars to "fix" the problem by writing new software and software patches that would overcome the BIOS limitation.  Around the year 2000, patches were made available on the internet which made a software "jump" allowing for a software "fix" that compensated for the hardware being unable to translate 2XXX dates.  For the most part, the fixes at that time suceeded (we all wondered how the computer industry and software writers could have been so damned stupid to begin with!...I think most people at that time realized that it was just another way for the hardware and software industries to make money by creating a serious limitation like this).  For example, at the time, I was running Windows 98SE, and had to add a patch to the operating system to overcome the glitch.  Eventually, I had to buy a new computer just to get rid of the flaw in (prior to year 2000) error.    So if the computers you bought were from this era, you are going to run into a date recognition problem, which of course, throws off the operating system...because many calcuations depend on the system clock - and date calcuations in databases and spreadsheets and calcuation functions are all affected by this error.  The system clock resides on a crystal chip sitting on the motherboard which tells the system time which is reported by the hardware to the software operating system platform.    Now, if you just happen to be fortunate enough NOT to have the Y2K "bug" in your hardware, you could perhaps, upgrade your BIOS chip (there are BIOS vendors out there who will do it for a price).  It all depends on if they still have BIOS chips in stock for those motherboards [which I doubt!]...but you never know.  New BIOS chips were an alternative answer to the Y2K patch fixes, but at that time, a new BIOS chip could cost $80 - $100.  You would have to buy a separate tool called a BIOS chip puller or simply a "chip puller," which is a tool that pulls the IC chips from pc boards - and these tools cost somewhere between $15 - $25.  So potentially you are looking at an investment of maybe $125, IF this turns out to be an alternative - which I don't think you want to do - but I just mention it in passing.    The other problems are directly related to the cpu in question and whether those processors were "locked."  Intel decided years ago, prior to Pentium IV, to lock the overclocking capability of the processor because they did not want to be responsible for the liability of replacing burned out processors being returned to them under warrenty.  So the simple answer was to lock the processor and preclude the ability to overclock.  The locking mechanism cannot be removed from these cpu's, in which case you will not be able to adjust the front side bus or the multiplier, even IF the BIOS is set up to do it.  The cpu will just ignore the BIOS in this case and you will see no improvement in performance or the cpu will just lock up and you will not be able to boot the computer.    The other problem is software related.  You will not be able to run XP, for example, if there is not an absolute minimum of 256 Mb of operating RAM and XP will be critically stepped down and just about crippled at this level.  Some services may be unavailable and I think you will either encounter errors or be dissatisfied with the performance you get because when XP came out, people were complaining that XP was a resource "hog," which of course, since then, hardware has grown immensely in capability and XP has received a significant performance repreive as a result.  So if I were you, I would try to run either Windows 2000 or Windows ME or Window 98 SE, because these operating systems were designed to deal with much more limited hardware resources than XP is.  Vista would be impossible on those old computers - it just won't work, so don't even attempt it.    The last problem, is security related.  Those old operating systems are highly vulnerable to security attacks due to the complete lack of security patches.  Securit|`|OIC0vsEWaa	yes you can do it. you can overclock just about any computer.    couple things that might give you trouble:    cooling. they probably do not have the best cooling considering how old they are. before you do anything, spray out all of the dust from the inside of the computer. this will reduce heat tremendously. the case cooling is probably not the best, and most likely they do not have quality heatsinks for the cpu. things could get rather hot. unless these were custom computers that have proper cooling.    second, if you are trying to increase the clock speed of the cpu, the standard method for increasing it involves increasing the multiplier. if the cpu has a locked multiplier (it will unless it is a Black Edition), then you wont be able to do much.    but anyway, you should be able to overclock them. they have a bios system that hasn't really changed over the past decade, so that shouldn't be a problem.|`|LFWWPgpQaa	Maybe, It depends on the Motherboard and processor.    For example some AMD chips needed to have a lead pencil marked on the top of the unit to connect two tracks which would open the multiplier on the CPU.    Some motherboards also dont allow you to  change the FSB or clock multiplier even if the CPU would handle it happily.    If you list out what motherboard model and CPU you have we can determine if its possible.  That being said there is a very good chance it will be possible and you just need to work out if you will be overclocking these machines via changing the Front Side Bus (FSB) in small upward incremements or changing the CPU multiplier (possibly while lowering the FSB slightly to lower the massive jump a multiplier change can have).

u2vwOZxvaa	What you want to do is to open a website account with a good web host. Then you use Fantastico to make a new Wordpress blog.  You then upload all your pages from the old blog to the new blog. So the new blog is basically a copy of the old one.    Once all of your stuff is on the new blog, you go to the old blog and you setup a 301 redirect, for each of your posts. So if someone types in the address of a post, they are redirected to that post on your new blog.    Below I have put a link to a plugin to automate the 301 redirect process, an article about good blog hosts and an article about how the search engines see the transfer.
