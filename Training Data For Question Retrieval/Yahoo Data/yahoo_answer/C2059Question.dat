20070824072921AAHZsHH	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	è vero che negli ultimi giorni è uscito un metodo per telefonare gratis? come faranno le compagne telefoniche?	Quello che vi serve per telefonare gratis è un cellulare Nokia e una scheda della Vodafone (con gli latri operatori vi verranno contati lo stesso gli scatti). Dopodiche dovete:    1: Togliere tutti i PIN dal vostro cellulare, non deve esserci nessun blocco alla sua accensione;    2: Entrare nel menu dei messaggi e inserire nel numero della casella vocale il numero di chi desiderate chiamare e uscire da quel menu;    3: digitare *3370#, con questo codice il cellulare si spegnerà e si riaccenderà. Al momento dell'accensione appena compare il simbolo della batteria dovete digitare il 112 far partire una chiamata, interromperla subito e tenere premuto il tasto 1 fino a quando partirà la chiamata verso il numero di casella vocale, cioè al numero che avete impostato in precedenza. A differenza della altre chiamate in basso del display non comparirà la scritta "fine" comparirà la scritta "menu". La linea con questo tipo di chiamata è bloccata, ovvero se la persona che chiamate deciderà terminare la chiamata la linea non si interromperà (potete provare a chiamare i telefoni fissi, se il vostro interlocutore terminera la chiamata e poi rialzerà la cornetta la conversazione sarà ancora attiva. Se volete interrompere voi la chiamata dovete spegnere il telefono, in tasto al centro non vi permetterà di interrompere la conversazione ma solo di entrare nel menu.

This evening, I've clicked on a bunch of questions that are listed as "Open" and with zero answers... and found them "Resolved" with many answers! I've also come across a lot of dead ones, you know: "There was a problem accessing that question" or something like that. What's going on? Anyone else noticing this?

20090204233032AAUjUb0	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Shopping	Amazon.co.uk prices??? what is happening?	Just a little observation of mine but i have been using this amazon site for years aswell as most of you have at some point too...is it me or are their prices increasing too a ridiculous high, i have noticed that the difference in prices for the same item on HMV, AMAZON and PLAY.COM  are vastly different meaning pounds different and amazon especially.  They seem to put an item on for say ￡39.99 for a week then crank it upto ￡42-49 then after a week or two put it back into sale and say upto 60% off and bring it back down to ￡39.99 again which i know is very clever marketing, making you think you have a bargain but is actually really annoying..i like amazon.co.uk and will continue to buy from them and hunt for great bargains on there but..this was just a little thing that i had noticed..plz comment....

20090205025141AAcjwoV	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	When searching for undecided questions using advanced search resolved questions return, why?	I'm using the Yahoo! Answers Advance Search feature to search for questions in the undecided state (e.g. voting).  I'm wanting questions that are NOT RESOLVED nor are they OPEN.  Yet, when I do this well over 50% of the results are RESOLVED questions (some for MONTHS!).      I'll use keywords, such as:  ffxi, final fantasy xi, sneakers, gym shoes, plimsolls, windows XP x64, etc.  The key word typically doesn't matter.      Tonight I did ffxi and final fantasy xi of the 21 results 18 of them were in the resolved status.      I'm wondering:      1) Why the advanced search is returning resolved questions when I'm asking for undecided questions?      2) Does Yahoo! know about this problem and does Yahoo! care?      3) How do I report this problem and get real results?      I tried to report it using the customer service bug report form, but they sent me (3 times) a canned response saying the problem is because my ISP has connection issues.  I asked specific questions and always got the same canned reply.  It seems no one even bothered to read my bug report.      Oh, one time the response was different as it talked about using search in Yahoo! Mail.  Ah, what Yahoo! Mail search problem?  This is a Yahoo! Answers search issue.  They reply then went back to it being a communications problem with my ISP.      4) Anyone else see this problem?      As for awarding the 10 points, I'm looking for an answer that helps me resolve this issue and at least reduce the occurrences of incorrect results or eliminates them completely.
