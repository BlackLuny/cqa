It has no bearing on cable or satellite service.  Any boxes you need for these services will be provided by them if you need them.|`|nkV5kLF5aa	If Cox gave you a digital box to watch digital channels, then yes, you will need it.

noU2uKEoaa	I suspect you are using the same phone you had when you were using the Vodafone sim. This phone is network locked and you will have to request a network unlocking code or subsidy code from Vodafone.<br>  <br>  Vodafone UK will provide this code free ( for pay as you go ) if you have had the phone 12 months or longer. Otherwise ￡19.99.<br>  <br>  Just a small comment:- It's the sim card being used that determines the network you are on NOT the phone itself.|`|lTOeMNnraa	Go back to the shop and ask them.|`|A1S5KNUkaa	Do you mean you've bought an Orange phone to use your Vodafone sim in?  If that's the case Orange phones are locked to the Orange network therefore your Vodafone sim won't work in it and you will need to get the Orange handset unlocked.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)<br>  <br>  If it's asking for a network code then it's locked to a particular network which I'm assuming is Vodafone since your Vodafone sim works in it.  So if you're trying to put an Orange sim card in it it won't work until you've had the handset unlocked which will cost you approx ￡15 and most Vodafone stores can do that for you.

The other stuff, no so much. <br>  <br>  Sony Vegas Studio Platinum, around $85, is capable of editing AVCHD in high definition and producing finished media. See here:<br>  http:<br>  <a href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope" rel="nofollow">http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/movi...</a><br>  <br>  This comes with DVD Architect, a program that can author interactive DVDs. It doesn't author Blu-Rays (the version with the expensive version of Vegas does). However, you can generate a very basic (no menus) Blu-Ray image directly from Vegas. <br>  <br>  Obviously, if you just want back-up to DVD or Blu-Ray (rather than a standard playable disc for set-top players), you can just burn your files onto DVD as they are. <br>  <br>  There are other options. I'm a Vegas user, but before DVD Architect 5 came out, I messed around with Nero's "Vision" program. This is a very, very simple program for making DVDs, Blu-Rays, and "AVCHD" discs... that's basically Blu-Ray format on DVD (good for maybe an hour's worth of video). I never quite got that to produce correct Blu-Rays, but it did the AVCHD fine, as long as I changed around the filenames a bit. That's Nero 8... Nero 9 has been shipping for awhile, you might check it here:<br>  <a href="http://www.nero.com/enu/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nero.com/enu/index.html</a><br>  <br>  The main reason I got Nero 8 was that I was already using Nero as a general purpose DVD/CD burning program, and the update got me Blu-Ray support, too. I wasn't expecting much from the add-on stuff like Vision or Showtime.<br>  <br>  There's a great site for all things video here: <a href="http://www.videohelp.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.videohelp.com.</a> They have information and tutorials about making DVDs from free software sources. I don't think the freeware is quite up to dealing with AVCHD or Blu-Ray yet, but it may be some day soon, so that's worth checking from time to time.|`|TaxYLHbMaa	I would suggest sony vegas .. yes it is expensive but after that you will never have inept software for the whole editing experience

And you can only use it on an HD TV but The benefits of HDMI vs your regular RCA Cable is HDMI transfers uncompressed digital audio and video leading to the best digital quality possible since there is no degradation of the signal through compression/decompression processes. <br>  <br>  I got inexpensive cables since it is a digital signal either you get a signal or you dont it doesn't matter how much the cable is they all work the same digital audio and video in one cable !!!|`|akvrwpywaa	No.  It is absolutely not worth it.  In fact I'd be surprised if either TV even had an HDMI port.  At such small sizes, you're not going to be able to tell the difference in resolution.  Just use S-video or component.
AbRfd29Haa	It's kind of a complex question... but think "marketing" and "licensing", mostly. <br>  <br>  For TV series, well, we have the same problem here .. if we get British shows at all, they're usually a year past the first run on your side of the pond. <br>  <br>  For TV, it's rather simple: the broadcaster wants to buy a who year's series, and then show it whenever it fits into their schedule. So I can get "Dr. Who" on the SciFi channel, but the next season, that's new for me, will come out in May or June, and I guess it's what you all got last year (we're still on David Tennant as The Doctor).<br>  <br>  For films, there's maybe less of a good explanation. For distribution into Europe, there's the issue of adding subtitles or dubbing, but obviously not an issue for a UK release. It may be the cost and infrastructure of making film prints.. they may simply want to complete the US showing of the film before it opens in the UK, to save on materials costs... I never heard a great explanation for this. <br>  <br>  Home video, of course, is a chain of events following the theatrical release, so if the film is late to the theater, it's late to DVD or pay-TV. Home video needs a PAL conversion, but that's hardly a great deal of work. <br>  <br>  For games, well, they may need PAL conversions too, and that could be a bit more programming, to take advantage of the extra space on an SD PAL screen.. but it's no issue for high-def games. It's probably due to licensing and distribution, too... once the game is ready for UK release, it goes to the UK distributor. They may have reasons to delay it, they want to time the release for the best impact, just as with film releases.<br>  <br>  Some of it's totally artificial... like DVD or Blu-Ray regions. With these, they intentionally enforce incompatibility. The idea here, at least originally, was to make sure that the licensing to a UK distributor was still worth something. If my company is going to handle the manufacturing and distribution of a popular film, it's hardly worth as much to me if I know that 50% of my potential buyers already got the US version on Amazon or something. Agree with the practice or not, but that's the reason for it.|`|KTzBMxSeaa	sometimes, games take 3 to six months to be localised for PAL format AND for each language in Europe.  sometimes, Europe gets games that  NTSC format doesn't get at all!  you'll just have to be patient.

3CJAUyqPaa	All consumer camcorders are "easy to use" if you can charge a battery in the camcorder or other charging method, insert and remove media (flash memory, miniDV tape, miniDVD), turn on the power, and press a button to record/stop.<br>  <br>  All consumer camcorders are "easy to transfer" to a DVD if you use a "direct to DVD" burner.<br>  <br>  Then you skipped a step... but all camcorders' video is "easy to transfer" to a computer... but it depends on the camcorder and the computer. Generally speaking, to upload to the internet (using sites like YouTube or Vimeo or other video sharing sites, you will need to convert the video file to a format that the sharing site requires - generally, they accept .avi, .wmv, .mov and .mp4.<br>  <br>  MiniDV tape based camcorders require your computer to have a firewire port. Video is imported to the computer by connecting the camcorder's DV port to the computer's firewire port. USB will not work. When the camcorder is connected to the computer with a firewire cable (not USB), nothing will "automatically" happen. An application like a video editor (or WinDV) is required to import the video. MiniDV tape provides best available video because DV (and HDV is a lot less compressed than other consumer video storage types.<br>  <br>  Hard disc drive (HDD) and flash memory camcorders (excluding "pocket" flash memory camcorders) use very highly compressed MPEG2 video data files for standard definition. Typically, video editors cannot deal directly with these files so they need to be converted using tools like HandBrake or StreamClip - among MANY others. For high definition, consumer HDD and flash memory camcorders typically save to a very highly compressed AVCHD file type. A video editor capable of dealing with AVCHD files is required. For Windows/Vista machines, Sony Vegas and Adobe Premiere float to the top. For MacOSX on an Intel-chip, iMovieHD '08 or newer or the current version of FinalCut work.<br>  <br>  HDD camcorders have problems with high levels of vibration and high altitude. They can stop recording. MiniDV tape and flash memory do not have these problems.<br>  <br>  Pocket cameras can save to various formats - if they do not use the above non-pocket flash memory camcorders' formats, then they will likely save to .mov format. Using tools like HandBrake or StreamClip to convert these files applies - especially in the Windows/Vista computer operating system environment.<br>  <br>  Standard definition, consumer, DVD based camcorders save to extremely highly compressed VOB files. Their video was not really meant to be edited. If you choose to go this route (bad idea), you will rip the video from the disc using something like HandBrake. Video quality for editing will be poor.<br>  <br>  High definition, consumer, DVD based camcorders save to extremely highly compressed AVCHD files. These are treated basically the same as the AVCHD files from HDD or flash memory camcorders. NEVER put a small or odd shaped disc in a slot loading optical drive - only in drawer loaders that can use DVD format discs.<br>  <br>  AVCHD compressed video or HDV requires a pretty current computer CPU for editing, lots of hard drive space and lots of RAM in the computer.<br>  <br>  Rendering a DVD playable in DVD players rquires a DVD authoring application like WinDVD (Windows/Vista) or iDVD (Mac OSX) - there are MANY other titles.<br>  <br>  MOST of the camcorder manufacturer's AC power adapters can use 110v or 220v. All you need is the little converter on the wall plug side. HOWEVER, this can vary by camcorder and manufacturer, so you need to check the power supply and the camcorder's instruction manual to be sure.<br>  <br>  If you are expecting to plug the camcorder's AV cable into the North American (NTSC) camcorder and a local TV (PAL or SECAM), chances are high that it will not work. I am not aware of any camcorder that does this "translation".<br>  <br>  The video format source and video editor and burning to DVDs will dictate whether DVDs you burn from the computer will work in local DVD players. Chances are very high this will not work.<br>  <br>  Best choice in your price range:<br>  Canon HV30; miniDV tape; standard definition and high definition (DV and HDV); has a mic jack and manual audio control.<br>  Canon HF10, HF11, HF100: SD flash memory; AVCHD compression (this is a negative item).|`|RCbtRF4xaa	Canon VIXIA HF10 Flash Memory High Definition Camcorder is simply great. Small, excellent video quality, and an extremely convenient storage. Like many other costumers, I was divided between the HF100 and HF10 models, but here is a definitive difference that, after two moths, made my choice the right one: I've lost a very important recording with a defective Transcend SDHC 16gb card when plugging it to my computer. So, first of all, I recommend buying cards from traditional brands, to avoid headaches. Second, as the HF10 has 16gb of internal memory, you're able to record to it and then copy the files to the SDHC card with the camera, before plugging it to the computer. With this simple procedure, the operation of transfering files to the computer becomes safer, as you have a backup. <br>  <br>  List Price: $1,099.99  <br>  Sell Price: $599.00 free shipping  <br>  You Save: $500.99  <br>  reference: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-HF10-Definition-Camcorder-Stabilized/dp/B001144JQU/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&s=photo&qid=1235752795&sr=1-8&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Canon-HF10-Definit...</a>

2dddd2ea86c6d472e9a5e37ac355f99daa	Depends what you want really, if you can manage with a poor camera then the iPhone will eclipse most others in terms of functionality. If you're looking for an outstanding camera then go for a LG Renoir or Samsung Pixon M8800; both have 8 Megapixel cameras. It also depends how much you're willing to spend and if you're looking for a contract or pay as you go phone because prices really vary between the two. Other viable options would be the Samsung Omnia or Tocco, or a G1 from T-Mobile if you're into a bit of tech geekery. Stay away from the Blackberry Storm, it was rushed out and wasn't market ready. Overall the best way to decide is to go to a shop and test them all out, but check internet deals before comitting to a purchase, especially with lengthy contracts.

If they are not included, then you may or may not have an interruption depending on the time between the previous tenant closing their account and you opening yours.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't get into trouble for the extra hookups.  A cable company may charge to install that many though.  The splitters are OK provided that you don't split it so many times the signal gets too weak.  The same cables are used for TV and internet and phone, if you choose to get those services from the cable company.<br>  <br>  For HS internet, you will need a cable modem and a router (probably a wireless router if the house is not wired for computers).  These are available from the cable company or you could go to Best Buy or similar and purchase them.|`|fwdsp3dVaa	You have to call up the local utility companies and start an account with them.

Also it's not uncommon to get a better price if you sign up online. <br>  <br>  It doesn't hurt to check out the local big electronics stores (Best Buy, etc) and see if they market this kind of service. <br>  <br>  Most likely there are already cable outlets in most of the rooms. You can add splitters but you might get to the point where the signal gets too weak for good reception. I wouldn't worry about this unless a problem shows up. <br>  <br>  You will need to decide what cable TV service you want. Minimum cable TV is a lot cheaper than getting everything! What channels do you need? If you get premium services, you will probably need a cable box for each TV. Gets expensive. Do you have a starving student budget or a "Gossip Girl" budget?<br>  <br>  Depending on your location, you might be able to get internet service from your cable, phone (DSL), or a wireless company like <a href="http://clearwireoffers.com." rel="nofollow">http://clearwireoffers.com.</a> <br>  <br>  Whatever internet supplier you use, you need a matching modem to connect to the service. Frequently you get this from the supplier, but sometimes you buy it youself. <br>  <br>  Once you get the internet service to your apartment you will need a wireless "Wi-Fi" router to share the internet connection. These are a cheap & common item, but you need someone with a little computer experience to set it up properly.  Get a wireless "G" or "N" router with WPA or WPA2 security. Most laptops have a Wi-Fi receiver built into them. For desktop computers there are adapters built as PC cards or USB devices.

1HtTxOOQaa	Macs are really awesome. The beauty actually lies in it's OS-Leopard. It's so much efficient compared to a Windows OS. Leopard (better known as Mac Os X) uses very little resources and so even my 1.6 GHz 2 GB Ram MacBook Air smokes my 2.4 GHz 2 GB Ram PC in terms of speed. Macs hardly ever hang unlike a PC, and the best part is there are hardly any known Mac viruses. Also, lets face it, Macs are prettier than any other Windows operating laptop (unibody Macs are great looking). Also, Mac OS X is graphically better than a Windows OS. The OS is 64 bit and the OS feels more polished than a Win Os. Trust me, after using Mac OS, you will never want to go back. It has a slight learning curve(like multi-touch features etc), but after that you will ask yourself how the hell was I living without this.<br>  <br>  The main problem occurs when you try to install a software. Though now-a-days, nearly all the softwares out there have a Mac variant, Windows has the largest collection of softwares (most useless). It will be safe to safe all major softwares out there works on Mac as well, but I can't guarantee you that you will find every software for a Mac. But, I have created a partition and installed Windows in it too if I ever come across a Win only software (all Macs come with an app called bootcamp which lets you install Win on your Mac-very simple just follow the procedure and official). You can't go the other way round like install Mac on a PC but you can install Win on a Mac!!!<br>  <br>  Currently Macs have 3 flagship products: MacBook, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro (given in order of prices-low to high). MacBook is probably the most balanced out of the 3 in terms of price and features. The main drawback with a Mac is that they suck at gaming, so don't buy it for that purpose. <br>  <br>  If ever you decide to buy a Win laptop, then the brands to choose are Sony and HP. Dell too cause it's cheap.|`|ahuFrmWQaa	dont get a pc get a mac there tens times better|`|0xp9Oobnaa	It depends how you are going to use it.\<br>  <br>  Mac are the best for schooling, business and multimedia use, but has limited access to the computer world that they only want you to use Apple/Mac products only.<br>  <br>  PC are the best for high end hardware and software also you can choose how you want it and lots of freedom of use, pretty much more sections than Apple/Mac. PC may get more viruses than Mac, as long you don't open up anything that can contain viruses like a unsecured website.<br>  <br>  If you want a PC laptop go for Toshiba or Asus, but they are expensive and very good, Dell are good and has great deals. Don't get HP, they are not better than Dell.<br>  <br>  Apple/Mac are sometimes expensive, but if you get it then you will have limited access to software, like most games don't run Mac, because of their hardware and software that is not compatible and the way their software is written.<br>  <br>  So it all depends how you are going to use your laptop. I would say 75%  of the world uses PC, because it has more access to the computer world than a Mac.|`|wCDIVS4Haa	see the video.|`|n3f4EF7Kaa	hey here is your answer. get a PC bcz you can safely install MAC on it as well as Windows Vista.|`|yIMUfAj4aa	pc, get a dell|`|g9Itk4RZaa	Totally get a mac.

jKc7aDCwaa	If it's chipped, your Wii should be able to play games from any region and TV system but may require some setting in the modchip to enable. Also depends on the modchip too, I believe.|`|A7ijvQyDaa	This depends whether or not:<br>  1. Your TV is PAL or NTSC<br>  2. Your game is PAL or NTSC<br>  <br>  PAL and NTSC are not different regions and do not apply to region locks or anything. They refer to the format in which information is sent and the power used to send them. If some components are PAL and some are NTSC it will either not work or will not display properly. Even with a million modchips you won't be able to fix this.<br>  <br>  Refer to the website below for details. ;p
OJejxpPpaa	I am a virgin mobile customer and I also thought that this phone was interesting. With this phone you can use many features like:<br>  -Texting<br>  -Email<br>  -IM<br>  -Google<br>  -AOL<br>  The thing about this phone is that you can be logged into all of these things and be able to go back and forth. You know "got a text, got an email, another text" Now moving to the plan. The phone itself costs $149. The actual plan is $65 a month with 500 minutes+unlimited data. I have the wild card but the ocean 2 seems like an awesome phone. So if you like it, go buy it.  =] =]

After all that I believe they send you a prepaid shipping box/label and you send it to them.|`|AA11556697	a qucik fix is to remove your HD, unplug ALL plugs except for the power cord, turn it on, wrap it in a towel and let it run for 20-30 min until it over heats, you will know it over heated by the red lights flashing and the xbox not running... then turn it off plug everything back in start it back up you should be good to go for a few days... this is the legal way of a qucik fix, there are other avenues you can explore BUT i wont discuss them here...

a0a73cc36dad2e87af124272d4694c43aa	due the the fact that there is a real supply and demand prob with nikon. I would really look carefully at the really cheap places. The company that I work for is selling 1000 D80's a week and we are only getting 800 in from nikon. Nikon is saying that they are going to be short on them for a few months. So the question is why would someone sell it cheaper when we cant keep them at full price. There are alot of scammers out there. If I was you I would pay full retail and get a nikon warrenty.

d3cb53a9118c633449929330163ae2e0aa	I used to work for verizon wireless. You don't know what you want will be difficult you need to ask your self what features or style ou are looking for in your phone. for 200 you can get a phone with a 1.3 megapixel camara on it. you can get a phone that can play music on it. and the style of the phone can be like a razr, not the krzer that more expensive. bluetooh you can for under 200. it just depends. think of this. the more features you want on a phone the more expensive that is how the weigh the price or sometimes its by the trendy style of the phone that weigh the price as well.

RyvKws7Laa	No.  This is an inherent weakness of LCD TVs.  LCD manufacturers have tried to improve this by coming out with 120Hz and now 240Hz televisions.  So the refresh is finally getting to a point to compete with CRT, DLP, and Plasma.  But at the current state you're paying a huge price premium for those things.<br>  <br>  So unfortunately right now your friend is just going to have to ride it out.  You can try sitting a bit further back from the TV.  The further away you are, the harder it is to see some of those issues.

RpCwfcRzaa	The product hasn't been recalled. She's wrong. Microsoft fixes and extends the warranty on all 360s to three years, but it's only for the Red Rings of Death. The problem you're having is NOT the RRoD. E74 with a red light in the lower right hand corner means there's a problem with the hard drive so it's not covered under the Microsoft extended warranty. I've had it happen to mine. Since you have a warranty from Wal-Mart, they have to replace it for free. MS has nothing to do with it unless you want to pay them $100 to fix it. Take it to Wal-Mart, tell them Microsoft doesn't cover that problem in the extended warranty and that it hasn't been recalled like the lady told you, and tell them they have to replace it since it's still under the warranty you got from them. Even if it was the red rings, Wal-Mart still would have to replace it since you bought the warranty from them and you're still under it.|`|1HtTxOOQaa	Relax welcome to the RROD club. Don't worry, since you have the RROD, Microsoft will replace the thing. I didn't even have a warranty and good old MS replaced the thing.

This is because the caller id signal (sent via digital signalling between the first and second rings on a lan line or via (iirc) sms on most cell phones) specifically does not contain the number on a blocked caller. Normally it will instead contain a header specifying that the number should be displayed as "blocked".<br>  <br>  (USA Specific)<br>  For 800 and other toll free numbers, the company is subscribed to something called 'Inward WATS Service'. This service provides another service called ANI (Automatic Number Identification) which always provides the callers number and is not related to Caller ID.
e5ee4f550f5f8e4255f207c87c7435beaa	Well personally, I would stick with an iPod and separate phone.  It is like all-in-one printer machines.  With the Chocolate or an all-in-one, you do have ability to do everything, but each part may not work as well.  I think an iPod would have better music and sound quality than a Chocolate, just like an all-in-one will have a scanner, but it won't be as good as a separate scanner.  <br>  In short, the Chocolate can do more, but can it do it at the same quality level?

AA10287427	What you are hearing is probably not the shutter,  but the gears grinding in the zoom lens system. I have a Toshiba that got dropped and it has the same problem. Took it apart and found there is no way to repair it. It only cost $100 about 3 yrs ago and was only a 2.3 gig camera that used the old obsolete smart cards. So, got me a new Pentax DSLR on sale for under $600.<br>  The difference between a consumer ($ 350 or less) view camera and a prosumer (under $1000) DSLR is like a box brownie and a top line Nikon. The Pro DSLR's start at $1000 and go up - WAY up. <br>  What you might try (since it may be junk any how) is to saturate it with ordinary rubbing (isopropyl) alcohol around the lens mount and see if it is just crusted up.<br>  You can do that with it turned on as the alcohol is non-conductive and won't short it out.|`|2RJZys3qaa	It is probably fixable, but is also probably impossible to find someone with the parts and know how to do it.<br>  <br>  It would probably be cheaper and better to just buy a new one.

f57c089243264bf27334a0a7a8b30246aa	Depends where you order it from.  In the past I've ordered unlocked phones and it can take weeks.  I have also ordered a phone with a plan from Wirefly and it came in 1 day.  But they are an authorized agent for the carrier.  <br>  <br>  In other words, be careful ordering unlocked phones from sites that don't also sell plans.  Some of these sites list phone models but don't keep inventory.  They order the phone from overseas when you place your order.  If they didn't give you a shipping tracking number, I would call and demand one.|`|026407cde2bc8691b34593dbabae7e6eaa	Now this is not a very well thought out question.

e412551d6c02320bcec6f322a94b18bbaa	Unlocked refers to GSM and iDEN phones which use sim cards.  Sprint phones are CDMA and don't use sim cards.  They can't be unlocked.  If anything, they may be able to be "flashed" to work with a different provider.  That still may not work.  You can still sell it as a Sprint phone, and whoever buys it can use it with Sprint.  You'll be stuck with the bill on the phone, not the person that buys it.|`|026407cde2bc8691b34593dbabae7e6eaa	It shouldn't be locked unless it was reported stolen?

1BPXJBNgaa	I am going to be buying a Nikon D40 on Amazon.<br>  <br>  I was in the same position as you - trying to choose between those exact ones, but then the prices went up on a couple of those cameras and couldn't really afford some of them. I was left with mainly choosing between a refurbished D60, new D40, or The E-410. The E-410 looked most appealing, but with its 4/3 mount and smaller sensor and less prominent lens selection I decided to go with the D40.<br>  <br>  The D60 is a great camera, but I don't see the reason in getting it over the D40 since they are essentially the same in most respects.<br>  <br>  If you are on a budget- the D40 will be a great camera (I can't wait to get mine). <br>  <br>  If not, get the Canon Rebel XS, or XSi (XSi isn't much more than the XTi and offers a lot more). <br>  <br>  The XSi has 12.2mp, and since mp only really matter for big prints or lots of croping, it might suite you well since you like macro photography. <br>  <br>  Or get the D40, and then get the Nikkor 55-200mm VR lens for about 230 dollars on Amazon. (totalling you at 410 + 230 = 640 dollars). I might be wrong, but I think the 55-200 would be a good macro lens... (correct me if I'm wrong someone! :)). <br>  <br>  Also for macro photogrpahy, you will want a good tripod for sharp images. You might also consider buying a remote for shutter release! <br>  <br>  Good luck! I love photography too, hope you continue to grow and develop your photographic skills! :)|`|HX6JjCTyaa	I would go with Nikon D40 with 2 lens 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX and 55-200mm f/4.5-5.6G ED AF-S DX Zoom $550 at amazon.com<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26rs%3D%26ref%255F%3Dsr%255Fnr%255Fi%255F0%26keywords%3Dnikon%2520d40%26qid%3D1235747164%26rh%3Di%253Aaps%252Ck%253Anikon%2520d40%252Ci%253Aelectronics&tag=computer0bd-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a>|`|RCbtRF4xaa	Nikon D60 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera <br>  with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR <br>  and 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR Zoom-Nikkor Lens <br>  <br>  Price: $699.95 <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-Digital-3-5-5-6G-55-200mm-Zoom-Nikkor/dp/B0013HOW6M/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1235744470&sr=8-2&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-Digital-3-5-...</a>|`|d55HYaktaa	Nikon D40 with 18-55mm -> $410<br>  Nikkon 55-200mm DX VR -> $203|`|0AqkCOWIaa	Nikon and Canon do offer some more cheap accessories, so you should definitely be looking at that in the long run. The bodies might be cheap, but the lenses are quite expensive even though they do not have Image Stabilization. Nikon and Canon brand lenses/accessories are cheaper, that's my observation anyway. Sony produces equally good products though, they are just at a higher price-point. <br>  <br>  I would choose the Canon Rebel XS with the 18-55mm IS lens. It is almost the exact camera as the Nikon D60. Same two and a half inch screen, same ten megapixels, same dust-reduction technology, etc. The only things the XS offers that the D60 doesn't have are Live view, More AF points, and it will autofocus any AF Canon lenses.<br>  <br>  The D60/D40x/D40 can not autofocus Nikkor Autofocus lenses, and most of their lenses are the AF models. There are only a few AF-S lenses, and they are usually expensive. In short, i think you get the most with the Canon XS.<br>  <br>  When it comes to the Olympus lens, it is a telephoto lens, and not a macro lens. If you want a macro lens, you'll have to purchase one separately. You can get far off Macro-ish shots, but they won't be Real macro shots.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	As was previously said any of these entry level DSLR's will be fine. Canon and Nikon have the most available new lenses and accessories. Sony is compatible with all the old Minolta auto focus lenses so there are a lot of used lenses available for them. The Olympus is a good camera but they have the smallest sensor of all the DSLR's and it uses a 4:3 aspect ratio. Like point and shoot cameras if you want to order prints all the standard print sizes will require cropping. Also smaller sensors tend to produce more noise than larger sensors. Meaning they don't perform as well in low light.<br>  <br>  Now as far as macro goes you will need to purchase a macro lens. The lenses that you mentioned are normal or telephoto zooms. They will not allow you to focus that closely. A good macro lens will cost you between $250 and $700 or so depending on which brand and size. The best ones for you would probably be in the 100mm range. They provide a good working distance. The smaller 50mm and 60mm lenses will require you to be very close to your subject. <br>  <br>  Go down to a good camera store and play around with the various models. The one that feels best in your hands and has the controls where they make sense to you is the camera you should get. Keep in mind though that lenses and other accessories are not interchangeable between brands so it can be very expensive to switch brands. Whichever brand you choose plan on sticking with it for a long time. Lenses will last for decades while you will be replacing the camera body every few years.
j5Apt8hWaa	The Nikon D40 is fast ... I think you are looking at the read/write speeds of different cards<br>  <br>  There is a new feature that some DSLR cameras use called UDMA.  At this time there are very few DSLR's that support that feature ... notably the professional models of all the Nikon's and two Canon's<br>  <br>  I reality, you can save your money and buy cards that are around 50 x to about 133 x.  It is a rare assignment that will require writing much faster than that.<br>  <br>  If you do buy a fast card, you will have it when you eventually upgrade from your D40 in four or five years when by then I would suspect that all DSLR's will support UDMA.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sandisk.com/Retail/Default.aspx?CatID=1644" rel="nofollow">http://www.sandisk.com/Retail/Default.as...</a>|`|AA12307705	The card will be fine.

zzD0mtjAaa	Did you put it on the freezer? hehe^^ just kding' maybe you need to refresh it, re boot it,or needs to be updated.<br>  "I dont know just a guess?"|`|026407cde2bc8691b34593dbabae7e6eaa	there are instructions on the itunes site to try to fix that problem.|`|60a063fb25d466da391924829b47c782aa	It sounds like what you're doing is pulling down the list of songs that are actually stored on the Nano and trying to delete items from the list.  This is not possible without setting it to allow you to manually manage songs and playlists.  The way you do this otherwise is pull up the playlist as it is stored in iTunes (do it while the iPod is not connected if you're not sure which is which) and delete the songs from that list.  When you sync your iPod, it will automatically adjust the content of that playlist.  If this causes a song to no longer be included in any uploaded playlist, it will also delete the song from your iPod until such time as you add it to a synced playlist or sync a playlist that contains it.
eCUlF9i9aa	dont delete them, buy them again and see if another one comes up, if it does, then delete those, and then check ure recycle bin. it probably shows the 2nd 1 cause the recycle bin
eCUlF9i9aa	have the new ones been breaking? if yes, then just handle them VERY carefully. if no, bang them around until they do...lol, just jokin. also handle them VERY carefully.
wcodvFnGaa	Unfortunately iPods comes with an specific memory capacity in it's hard drives, you cannot put more space on your iPod the only solution is that you delete those songs that you doesn't hear often or those songs you are not used to listen to give space to the new ones!<br>  <br>  Hope I can give you a better solution without sacrifying all those songs you like the most, but I most stick to reality and reality means that iPods come with specific hard drive capacity and cannot be expanded!<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes!!|`|4fae6142058974388152aa32f1af3275aa	delete some of the songs that you already have|`|eCUlF9i9aa	you either delete songs or buy a new music player|`|b9fonwHbaa	you have to go into the itunes and delete some of the songs from itunes. the ones that you really dont listen to just delete them then put more songs in your itunes and plug in you ipod. that should do the trick

While getting hooked up isn't difficult, it does require taking a close look at your equipment and purchasing the correct cables. Here's a look at some different ways to connect the two components.<br>  <br>   <br>  InstructionsDifficulty: Moderate <br>  Things You’ll Need:<br>  HDMI cable or DVI cable or VGA cable or S-Video cable <br>  Step1Inspect your television inputs and laptop outputs. Ideally you want to find a connection that matches, though adapters may be available to meet your needs. Some of the types of connections we'll be looking at are HDMI, DVI, VGA and S-Video. This is the most important step, as it will allow you to buy the right equipment. <br>  Step2Connect using an HDMI cable. This will be your best option, providing high definition video and audio to your LCD television. An HDMI port is rectangular with 19 pin holes. With both laptop and television off, connect the HDMI cable to the HDMI output port on your laptop and to the HDMI input on your LCD TV. <br>  Step3Connect video using DVI cable, and audio with mini-jack (3.5 mm) to RCA adapter. DVI is rectangular 24-pin HD connection with video only. Connect the DVI cable to your laptop's DVI output and then to the DVI input on the TV. Connect the single mini-jack end of the audio adapter into the headphone jack on your laptop and each of the two RCA cables into the corresponding audio inputs on your TV. <br>  Step4Connect using a VGA cable. VGA cable is the standard 15-pin connection that you would use to connect a computer moniter to a PC or laptop. Use a VGA cable to connect your laptop's VGA output with the television's VGA input. Use separate audio connection as in step 3. <br>  Step5Connect using S-Video cable. Be sure that both your television and laptop use the same type of S-Video (4 or 7 pin) and connect the cable from the laptop's S-Video output to the TV's S-Video input. In order to have audio, you'll need to connect a mini-jack to RCA adapter as in step 3. <br>  Step6Connect using an adapter. In the unlikely event that your LCD TV lacks any of the inputs above, purchase an adapter that takes one of the aforementioned output signals and converts it to a component video or composite video input that your TV will accept. Composite video is the most basic connection and is a simple yellow jack, much like you'd use to connect a DVD player. Component video is three separate plugs: a red, a blue and a green. Both methods require separate audio connection. <br>  Step7Turn on your devices. Once you've made the connections, turn devices on. Switch your TV to the input mode that corresponds with the input you used to connect your laptop, and you should now view your laptop on your LCD TV.|`|RLoilwCNaa	HDMI cable

Prés de la table est assis sur le sol un enfant handicapé prés d'une voiture à pédales.<br>  Plus tard, bien plus tard, le mémorialiste Geoffroy de Bourbon-Scotch raconte que Godefroi de Bouillon eut un enfant  adultérin avec la femme de son boulanger Isabelle de<br>  Plattemiche. Les historiens écrivent que les Brésiliens furieux de ne pouvoir participer au sac de Jérusalem firent boire à Isabelle un breuvage contenant de la thalidomide.<br>  L'enfant naquit sans jambe et fut appelé Court-Bouillon par sa mère.<br>  La voiture à pédales du tableau de Lenain est un cadeau que fit le maire de Paris lors d'une visite officielle pour faire la promo des couloirs de bus.<br>  Conclusion : On peut violer l'histoire mais à condition de lui faire de beaux enfants.Ce qui n'est pas le cas.

It will depend on how close you are to the mast and how many people are using the mast as to what speed you actually get.<br>  So it is important to make sure you have the good coverage before you buy.

However, I might be wrong.  Sprint uses CDMA where I believe Verizon is based off of the old TDMA system.  The only services that you can switch from is T-Mobile and Cingular which are on the GSM network and uses SIM Cards.

If you have a bluetooth wireless headset you should turn it on and go through the bluetooth settings on your phone. There you should be able to search for availaible bluetooth devices and sync up with the headset. You can use the same method to connect two bluetooth phones together. So if your friends have bluetooth on their phones you can send files such as music and pictures over a short distance.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA11965915	Menu>Settings>Connection>Bluetooth Link>Handsfree (If asked to turn on bluetooth, press yes)>[Look for Devices] (have ur other device's bluetooth on).|`|2gs4iZAsaa	To use Bluetooth on your phone, access the main menu and go to the settings button. Access the settings and go down till you come to connection. Click on the connection button, and then two options will pop up; Bluetooth Link and Sync. Click on the Bluetooth Link. Go to the Setup tab, highlight the Power option, and click change. Select On, decide on a name and then the Bluetooth is on. To actually send an object, go to the main menu, My Stuff, whatever tab your object is in, select the object, push the center button in between the two dot buttons, select copy and then if you do not have the phone you want to send the object to, select [Look For Devices]. The phone will scan for Bluetooth devices and then when you find the device you want to send the object to, select that phone. The phone will transfer the object and that's it.

Can`t tell ya if there was a code if it would work anyway. That might be a scam they might be selling the pin #`s that they get from the stores on the card that they haven`t paid for.

zXycmh40aa	The PlayStation Portable (プレイステーション?ポータブル, Pureisutēshon Pōtaburu, officially abbreviated as PSP) is a handheld game console released and manufactured by Sony Computer Entertainment. Its development was first announced during E3 2003, and it was officially unveiled on May 11, 2004 at a Sony press conference before E3 2004. The system was released in Japan on December 12, 2004, the United States and Canada on March 24, 2005 and in Europe and Australia on September 1, 2005.  The PlayStation Portable's main microprocessor is a multifunction device that includes a MIPS R4000-based CPU, hardware for multimedia decoding (such as H.264), as well as a vector unit dubbed "Virtual Mobile Engine". The MIPS CPU core is globally clocked between 1 and 333 MHz. During the 2005 GDC, Sony revealed that it had capped the PlayStation Portable's CPU clock speed at 222 MHz for licensed software. Its reasons for doing so are unknown, but are the subject of some speculation. However, recently released games such as Ratchet and Clank: Size Matters use a 266 MHz clock speed. Various homebrew tools enable users to operate at 333 MHz, generally leading to a higher frame rate at the expense of battery life.|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	If you are talking about pspwxp,  yes, no problem.<br>  <br>  Of course, you know, that's not really Windows XP, it's just a flash application that looks like it.|`|558b78485f10005b2e846fac69d8325aaa	You know, I've been trying to find that answer but now I know that it's just a portal not really operating system.|`|9f5b4e0162514a1f2a4bcdae5cb82690aa	sure go to <a href="http://pspwxp.110mb.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pspwxp.110mb.com/</a><br>  there Software is soooooo cool.<br>  You cant Send Text Messages to your friends. <br>  + lots of other things<br>  Totally worth it!!!!!

zXycmh40aa	An easy way to determine this is to remember that the G rating of a phone determines how good it is.  Therefore, a 3G phone is GOOD GOOD GOOD!
