z0PLjnLfaa	Legaly, Britain owns it. It was our ship. But, from what I've read about this today...The people who found it have the right to a pretty substantial reward. I think they've also been granted the permision to do the salvage work too.|`|xsa2HL7Jaa	Because the ship was a military vessel the ship ans it's contents  still belongs to Britain even though it went down in international waters.    had the ship been civilian then find keepers - not quite but pretty close to it.|`|IKCxj9gHaa	HMS Victory is a warship that was active and still in use it is also lying in British territorial waters so all rights to it are owed by the ministry of defence, it is only merchant ships that you have salvage rights to as these are owed by private companies or people, that said the MOD will usually come to some sort of arrangement with the finders, as you also pointed out there were 1100 sailors who went down with her but it has not yet been declared a war grave, but is unlikely to be called that, as it sunk in a strom not because of enemy action and also is over 200 years old.|`|bxlYleZkaa	The Government still own the ship and all its contents.|`|mKTFwaPCaa	British goverment has salvage rights, and I believe they are giving a bounty to the company that found the wreak ( IE a award / payment )

It's best to book a room if you know you're going to be super late. You do NOT need to check in at 9:30am. As far as i'm aware, for most, it's anytime. As long as there is someone on the desk. As i said; depends on the hostel.  But there is usually a check OUT time which is like 11am or something.    Summer is a busy time. But most people don't make reservations. I mean, where is the freedom in that? There will be a spare room somewhere in the city. It might just take a little longer to find it..    Relax :) Take it as it goes.|`|AA10527991	I think the 9:30 time is when you have to have the bed reserved by.  Most places I've stayed in don't want you there until after 3:00pm--or noon--as they need to change the sheets and vacuum.

sa8dElLZaa	The Roxas Administration (1946-1948). Inaugurated as first president of the new republic was Manuel A. Roxas, who defeated then-President Sergio Osme?a, Sr., in the April 1946 national election. (Osme?a was elected vice president in 1935 and succeeded Quezon to the presidency after the latter died while in exile in the United States.)<br>  <br>  President Roxas, a native of Capiz (now Roxas City) had to deal with the rehabilitation of the Philippines, tremendously ravaged by World War II.<br>  <br>  Various agreements with conditions, in favor of the United States, were discussed and approved by the authorities. One such condition was that American investors be given “parity” rights. That is, the U.S. investors had the right to be treated as equals of Philippine nationals, not as investors from any other foreign country.<br>  <br>  At the same time, there were absolute quotas of Philippine exports to the United States. On the contrary, there were no quotas for American exports to the Philippines. Moreover, the U.S. military obtained military bases in the Philippines without any rent for 99 years. The duration was later reduced. The lease was to end in 1991.<br>  <br>  In February 1948, President Roxas pardoned those who had cooperated with the Japanese during the war. Those who had served the Japanese were called “collaborators.” Roxas himself had played a part in the Japanese-sponsored wartime “puppet government.”<br>  <br>  It was during the Roxas administration that the Philippine Constabulary and landlord private armies had their days fighting the Huks and their farmer supporters over tenancy problems. The Huks had earlier fought the Japanese along with U.S-supported Filipino guerillas. But later, they supported the peasants in their fight with the landlords to improve the economic conditions of the land tenants.<br>  <br>  At first, President Roxas held negotiations with the Huks. As a matter of fact, his administration created an Agrarian Commission that passed a law giving 70 percent of the harvest to the tenants. However, there were difficulties in implementing the law.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, the Huks demanded that the winning congressmen of the Democratic Alliance be reinstated, among whom was Luis Taruc. They likewise demanded that the military police be disbanded and a general amnesty be given to those involved in the movement. Instead, President Roxas in March 1948 declared the People’s Liberation Army as a subversive organization.<br>  <br>  Quirino Comes to Power (1948-1953). In April 1948, Roxas died of a heart attack. He was succeeded by Elpidio Quirino, his vice president.|`|MT2eZM6Zaa	You can go to google and type Manuel Roxas biography and then you can find it there everything about Manuel Roxas.

5c936a54fb80e00b663741498162c091aa	I attended a public high school (LIC) and lived in a 2 family house that my parents owned. I lived right across from Astoria park and my friends would go there after school everyday and played ball.I also had many friends who were interested in the performing arts and Manhattan was only an 10 minute subway ride from Astoria that they would get the best training in the world. My best friend who is now on Broadway would not have been so successful if it was not for living so close to Manhattan. She got her first major gig while still in grade school.  Like all my friends every summer we went to our "home country" and spent 2.5 months. For me it was Brazil but most of my friends went to either Greece or Italy.<br>  I wasn't talented enough for the performing arts so I enlisted in the military right out of high school, served my country. I now reside in California and attend Stanford. My parents still reside in Queens and love it. I'm in my 20s<br>  <br>  Astoria is the most expensive part of Queens (because of it close proximate to Manhattan) and it changed a lot since I grew up there in the 90s. It became very yuppie.|`|4d3a7bbc1dffd218b8922b7e1819ce90aa	I lived in Queens (specifically Flushing) until I got tired of a 30 mile one way commute.  Queens has a larger percentage of private homes than any borough except Staten Island.  It also has some interesting restaurants and food stores in communities such as Flushing which have attracted a fair number of immigrants.  Many of the schools, especially in the northeast part of Queens (Douglaston, Bayside, College Point and Flushing) are better than average for NYC.   Rentals, whether apartment buildings or in 2-family homes, tend to be rather new and of good quality.  But public transportation is somewhat questionable, especially with planned construction that will mess up the IRT #7 line for a few years.|`|7YE2arJWaa	Queens covers over 400 square miles.

VxfyQZ2jaa	The other answers are correct about the last 5 or 6 days of Carnival being the height of the season.  It is all commonly called Mardi Gras, but Mardi Gras Day is actually the last day - and always on a Tuesday (Mardi Gras = Fat Tuesday in French).  This year the parades start on the weekend of February 13th to 15th and Mardi Gras Day is the 24th.    However, Carnival tends to take over the city for the last 5 or 6 days and it's a difficult time to visit for anything else. Restaurants go to limited menus, getting a table can be a problem, many museums & attractions close, etc.    If you want to be able to BOTH see parades AND sight-see you might be better off visiting on the first weekend of parades. Getting a hotel room, etc. will be easier, everything will be open, and there are still good parades - if not the "super parades" like Endymion and Bacchus.    Go to www.mardigras.com and www.mardigrasguide.com for more on Carnival in New Orleans.  The FAQ section may be especially helpful.    Hope you have a great time!|`|puYiHEbLaa	I was 23 the first time I went to Mardi Gras.  Trust me, you are going to have an absolute blast!!  I'd go the weekend before Phat Tuesday, it's when I went as well.  Spend time on Bourbon mostly, there will be tons and tons of people but it will still be fun.  Try and remember not to get too trashed because pick pockets WILL be out, and they will be paying attention to anything that they think they can steal.  I personally would wear jeans with deep pockets and keep my money in my pockets.  If you can find a cute over-the-shoulder purse to carry if you want a camera, cigarette, etc that would be good too.    Go to St Charles to see some parades, it's the route for the best ones.    Also, stay with your people that you went with.  New Orleans does have a bad rep for crime and there is a lot, but if you're smart you can avoid it.  Don't wander off by yourself, and try to stay in a group.  Don't go down a dark street with no people on it.  Take a cab if you have to, and remember that fear is a gift and if you don't feel safe get the h e double l out of there.  I'm not trying to scare you, I just want to paint a real picture for you.  You can still have a good time, just be careful and play it smart.    You do want to get out during the day and check out the city.  Go to Cafe Du Monde for Beignets and Cafe Au Lait, it's a New Orleans tradition.  If you've never had them before, the beignets are french doughnuts but taste like funnel cakes and Cafe Au Lait is coffee with milk.  Cafe Du Monde is on Decatur and Jackson Square.  Spend some time on Decatur, it's great and if you're hungover the people on Decatur won't bother you as bad as those will on other streets will.  Walk down to the French Market, you can find some great stuff down there.    If you're a book lover check out some local book stores, New Orleans has some great used book stores in the quarter and you can really find some great treasures!!    Be Safe and have fun!!|`|Lngb8ryFaa	feb 24th is Fat Tuesday which is the closing day of mardi gras....the weekend right before until fat tuesday is the peak party time...so in this case friday feb 20th 'til feb 24th will be one massive party...have fun, iwent right before hurricane katrina and cried when i had to leave!!!|`|nazjKNGuaa	The 23rd and 24th of February would be the best days.

You will need to negotiate separately with salespeople from each section (electrical, bedding, furniture, computers) as they're all specialists, but be aware that the salespeople are all authorised to discount quite heavily if you're good at bargaining. Each section is a separate franchise operated by a different franchisee, so they won't be particularly impressed that you've spend $x in another section, but you will still be able to get a very good deal if you're firm.

They have been tested over and over again to make sure it will get you to your destination safely. Just because an airplane crashes doesn't mean they will improve it. Take the a320 that landed in the Hudson for example. That plane was almost  brand new for US Airways, but it was bird strikes that caused both engines to go out. Will Airbus improve the design? No. <br>  The Q4000 that crash landed. The pilots should have had the de ice engaged. Will Bombardier improve the design?

The plane is the best it can be because of all the other experience the mechanics have had with the other planes. Because it is new, all the equipment is new so you don't need to worry.

As a fellow Australian, I'm angry that so much damage can be caused because someone got bored and decided to feel important, to be on the news. The people who started these fires should be made to experience the loss and destruction they caused. How would they feel if they saw their home in ruins after fires that were deliberately lit? <br>  <br>  How would they feel if everything they worked for is gone in an instant and their families have to line up for food and clothing?  A lot of people died or got injured in these fires, so what does this mean to the criminals who lit them? Yes, they are criminals. There's no nice way to describe them.<br>  <br>  If there's such thing as natural justice in the universe, those who started the fires would end up destitute through some misfortune in their own lives. Then will know how it feels to be left with nothing. They obviously don't care enough to own up to the police, because they're cowards and they were just trying to entertain themselves the day they lit the fires, something had to make them feel important so they can pretend to themselves that they're useful for something - pretending to put the fires out. <br>  <br>  They know the truth, though, they're gutless little pieces of nothing.|`|VgC5ip1xaa	1. Very sad. Many people lost lives and properties and it's a terrible thing.<br>  2. Wrong. The people that lit those fires should be lit up themselves.

It's good that us Australians are there for each other, but when are we going to get over ourselves and do more to be there for the rest of the world? 209 dead so far. 1700 die from HIV/AIDS every day in South Africa alone. Somehow, this isn't in the news. I don't know how many are now homeless, but there are 1.4 billion people living in extreme poverty worldwide. That's almost 70 times the entire Australian population.

31ceafe65e05226f19a45b4ab406d3b7aa	I would suggest going to UNSW to study a 'Bachelor of Planning' as it has a very good reputation overseas (mainly because of its connections with other universities worldwide). <br>  <br>  The 2009 UAI cutoff for planning was 82.10. Although, I would try to aim higher as they only accept approximately 50 students per year. However, UNSW also offers "HSC Plus" points- basically like bonus points that are added to your UAI in terms of the selection process for the planning course. This only applies to Design and Technology, Advanced English, and Geography though. The maximum amount of points you can earn is 5. If you get a band 6 in any of these subjects, you will get 3 points. A band 5 will result in 2 points, and a band 4 will result in 1 point. <br>  <br>  I think this is a good course to do and is fairly easy to get into (if you work hard of course!) as not many people know about it. The prospects are fairly good as the amount of urban planners have decreased. (I've heard around 16%! But don't quote me on that). Many planners also work in local councils and the state government. However, they can also work in the private sector alongside architects and the like in consulting firms. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped and good luck!|`|OYYYNCyCaa	contact the university and ask them thye will have all the correct answer to your needs<br>  <br>  or try your local council as well

I live an hour outside Toronto, Canada and have travelled coast-to-coast, so hopefully you will find my long-winded answer useful. Because of the vast size of the country, your destinations will depend on the amount of time you have. <br>  Coming from Austrailia you will most likely land in Vancouver and travel from the west coast to the east coast. Vancouver- very hip urban city with plenty of culture, nightlife and beautiful scenery, plenty of day trip stuff to do. Next I would recommend taking the train through the Rocky Mountains to Banff/Lake Louise/Calgary, some of the most breathtaking natural scenery in Canada. From Calgary I would fly to Toronto which is Canada's largest city and airport hub (about a 4.5 hour flight). You can get a Via Rail pass for the Toronto to Montreal corridor. For this leg of the trip I recommend a day trip to Niagara Falls, a few days in Toronto for culture/nightlife/shopping, an obligatory trip to Ottawa (national capital), Quebec City for its 400 year old history and french culture and Montreal for culture/nightlife/shopping. The east coast of Canada - New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland has a distinctly slower pace and the most friendly people in Canada with an Irish/Scottish celtic culture and breathtaking ocean scenery.<br>  <br>  As descrided above, I'd budget a minimum of 3 weeks. I hope this helps.

UIJorsD7aa	Whether or not a person is gay, a reform conversion is not done according to Jewish law, which is why t s not recognized by any Orthodox rabb.|`|i7oHTo9haa	Hi.  I have strong opinion on this topic and I always get thumbs down for my opinion, but I don't care, I'm still going to say it. Nothing bursts my bubble more than hearing about how lax the RoR laws are. While we are all worried about the Arabs with the trojan horse hostile takeover we don't watch our own leniency on another trojan horse of letting non-Jewish people immigrate thus creating a third set of peoples in Israel. If this keeps up there will no longer be a Jewish state. I would like to see Netanyahu and the far right finally address this issue and amend the RoR laws. G-d help them and us.<br>  <br>  I would deny the person because they didn't receive proper conversion. The RoR/Aliyah was based upon post Nazi era and it was basically to allow physical sanctuary to anyone that Hitler determined to be Jewish.  I believe we're in a new era now, and the laws are in serious need of updating if we are to retain a Jewish state. Attempts have been made to update (Chief Sephardic Rabbi Amar in 2006) but so far without success. <br>  <br>  My opinion is that it is my duty to protect the Jewish state, I will not have Hitler determine who is entitled to live in Israel, and only the Orthodox far right should be in charge of these issues with tight control. Orthodox control conversions and they should also control the immigration issues, but currently immigration is handled by secularists, or whomever controls the Knesset, secular democratic law. <br>  <br>  My beliefs are that Israel is first and foremost a religious state, and secondly a secular Jewish state for non-religious Jews with Jewish mothers, and thirdly an immigration state for other peoples to enter. It is not vice versa with an open ticket for people to enter on a false Jewish claim or by people that don't practice Judaism or are hostile to the Jewish state to enter its borders. Currently the law provides for Reform converts and for Messianics or others that do not even care about Judaism who have Jewish grandmother to make aliyah for political or other reasons, I would change that, in a heartbeat. By Israeli secular law yes they can immigrate, by Jewish law no, they are not Jewish and if the (hypothetical) person cared so much about the state of Israel and the Jewish nation (people) they would not go any other route except the route that all Jewish people recognize, Orthodox Jewish law. <br>  <br>  Israel is Holy nation for the Jewish people and Holy Land and it is my duty to preserve this. Righteous people are allowed to enter, I would have the person apply by immigration and deny access for aliyah. On immigration I would also deny as Israel needs to address other current issues first. They are welcome as tourism for a long extended stay.<br>  <br>  Chief Sephardic Rabbi Shlomo Amar:<br>  Amending the Law of Return<br>  In November 2006 Amar submitted a draft bill to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that would remove the conversion clause from the Israeli Law of Return. This would prevent converts from all streams of Judaism, including Orthodox Judaism, from having automatic citizenship rights in Israel, and restrict the Law of Return to applying only to Jews by birth whose mothers were Jewish.[3][4] This also affects potential immigrants who are descended from only one Jewish parent or grandparent, not all of whom would be accepted as Jewish under Orthodox law. See also: Matrilineal descent and Who is a Jew?<br>  <br>  Amar said in interviews that the bill was designed to prevent "a situation where there are two peoples in the State of Israel." Amar said the Law of Return's inclusion of converts had turned the conversion process into a political rather than religious exercise, and that many people were converting for immigration purposes, not out of sincere religiosity. Amar suggested that an alternative could be that converts, upon arriving in Israel, went through a naturalization process via the Citizenship Law. The bill also gives rabbinic courts and the Chief Rabbinate sole authority over conversions.<br>  <br>  Amar said that the bill was partially written in response to the Israeli Supreme Court deliberating a dozen petitions by the Israeli Reform movement to allow Reform converts to stay in Israel. Jews converted under Reform or Conservative auspices abroad have been accepted under the Law of Return since 1989, but the 2006 case deals with conversions that occurred in Israel. Amar argued that if the Reform converts were permitted to stay in the country, they would eventually become frustrated with their inability to marry Jews (as the Chief Rabbinate would not recognize their conversions as valid) and this would lead to them marrying non-Jews, which would polarize the state.<br>  <br>  Amar received some criticism from the Reform and Conservative movements in Israel and America, and various Israeli politicians and government figures, including Menachem Mazuz, Yossi Beilin, and UTJ MK Avraham Ravitz, who said he did not believe Amar's bill, if passed, would stop Reform or Conservative converts from receiving citizenship, which would lead back to the initial problem of "two peoples" in Israel. He added that Amar's proposed bill would constitute blatant discrimination against converts.[5] Other commentators noted that the citizenship process for non-Jews can be long and arduous, and pointed out that there are presently many naturalized Israelis, particularly immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who do not meet the halakhic definition of a Jew. One report, challenging Amar's claim that his bill was meant as a preventative measure, wrote, "The 'division of the Jewish people in Israel' is a present reality, not a future possibility."[6]<br>  <br>  However, some in Israel's legal community supported separating religious conversion from the secular citizenship process. Amar also received support from several religious politicians such as NRP MK Zevulun Orlev who said the bill would protect Jewish unity.[5]"<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Amar#Amending_the_Law_of_Return" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Amar...</a><br>  <br>  The Law of Return: An Introduction<br>  <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Politics/return.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsou...</a>|`|0fW76gB8aa	Its very hard to give you a definite answer. Personally, I would consider this person to be Jewish, however, I can't say what the Israeli Government's position would be.<br>  <br>  You should know that the law may change, to make it easier for converts, especially reform/conservative people, to get citizenship. <br>  <br>  It depends on who makes up the coalition. If the coalition is Likud, Kadima and Yisrael Beitenu (all quite secular parties) it is likely that it will become easier for Reform and Conservative Jews, and converts to Judaism, to be recognized as Jewish for Israeli immigration purposes.<br>  <br>  However, if there is a coalition which includes Shas and United Torah Judaism (both religious parties), it is less likely that the law will be changed.<br>  <br>  Nobody on Yahoo Answers can tell you what the Israeli Government will decide, but if you contact an Israeli Embassy or Consulate they will be able to tell you.|`|B3FBgxjEaa	The Israeli High Court of Justice decided on March 31, 2005, to approve conversions in Reform and Conservative ceremonies conducted abroad for fifteen non-Israeli residents who asked to be recognized as Jews in accordance with the Law of Return. Previously, those who resided overseas and went through the entire conversion process overseas in a Reform or Conservative conversion were recognized as Jews and could immigrate to Israel under to Law of Return. The court now ruled that people already residing in Israel who undergo all but the final stage of conversion inside Israel and then go overseas for the conversion ceremony also would be recognized as Jews by the State.<br>  <br>  Read the rest.<br>  <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&_Culture/convert1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsou...</a>|`|IwlFHNLGaa	this is a really good question.<br>  <br>  israel is not an orthodox state (in fact their first prime minister was an atheist) but nor is israel a reform state.<br>  the law of jewish "right of return" (any jew gets free citizenship to israel) is very controversial because it is hard to say who is a jew and who is not a jew.<br>  <br>  to be jewish, you are either meant to convert or for your mother to be jewish.  a friend of mine goes to a jewish day school in australia, but her mother comes from the phillipines; her dad is jewish.  she still sees herself as jewish, and israel would sport the same view if she required citizenship.<br>  <br>  just like some laws are recognised by reform and others by othordox, the same applies for people|`|UhnvXXxjaa	he is Kosher|`|q1pM85Moaa	Firstly, hello you.<br>  Secondly, i will answer your question.

aiH9WmnKaa	JAIPUR<br>  A New Shade Of Pink<br>  <br>  In 1743, 16 years after Jaipur was found-ed, Jesuit Father Jose Tieffen-tha-lar visited the city and was charmed by what he saw. He wrote: “The city, while it is new, is assuredly the most beautiful among the ancient cities of India, because in the latter everything is old, the streets are unequal and narrow. This on the con-trary has the splendour of the modern, with equal wide and long streets.”<br>  <br>  Three centuries later, its reputation as a beautiful, well-planned city is some-thing that Jaipur, Sawai Jai Singh II’s belo-ved creation, has to constantly live up to. Rajasthan’s capital does this without diffi-culty for the most part: its enchant-ing bazaars wear 200 years on their sleeves with pride, its perfectly laid-out stre-ets are easily navigated and the uni-form pink that the city sports inspires and enthrals visitors in equal measure. But — and there is bound to be a but — having lived here for 30 years, I often feel that today’s Jaipur doesn’t wish to be left behind in the race towards modernity. It seeks a com-bination of the modern and the ancient, of kings and software czars, of gleaming malls and resplendent palaces. Indeed, it’s this often heady and some-times puzzling mix that the visitor to Jaipur will today discover. There is not one Jaipur, but two cities that reflect the vivacious blend of the new and the old. Behind the city walls, you will find the original, planned heritage city that dates to the 18th century. Outside those walls is 21st century Jaipur, with spanking new multi-storeyed buildings, shopping malls, call centres and fast-moving traffic. The two Jaipurs make for an intriguing contrast: one that many books have laud-ed in superlatives already, and the other that you discover as you go along.  <br>   <br>  ORIENTATION <br>  Pick up a city map (Rs 20-30) from any bookshop or from your hotel, where it’s likely to be distributed free. The railway station and the bus stand are both locat-ed to the north-west and lie within a kilometre of the centre of the city. The airport is 14 km south of the city. Hotels are spread all over and transport, in the form of scooters, cycle rickshaws and pre-paid taxis, are readily available. It’s advis-able to fix the fare for both rickshaws and scooters before you hire one as they do not always run on meter. Expect to pay a minimum fare of Rs 25 from the station to Bani Park (a kilometre-and-a-half); keep in mind that the entire city lies between Amber and Sanganer and the distance between the two is 26 km. The main shopping areas are located within the walled city. For sightseeing, it’s best to arrange a taxi through your hotel. Ave-rage taxi fare for a full day (8 hrs or 60 km) is between Rs 1,200 and 1,500. All trips out of Jaipur are charged at the rate of Rs 6-8 per km, depending on the type of car and usage of AC. A minimum fare for 250 km has to be paid regardless of how many kilometres are covered. One of the oldest and most depend-able travel agencies in Jaipur is Rajasthan Tours (Tel: 0141-2385141/ 486). <br>  <br>  You can also opt for a bus tour organ-ised by the RTDC (Tel: 2202586, 2203531; full-day tour/ 9 am-6 pm, Rs 175; half-day tour/ 1.30-6 pm, Rs 80). Siyaram City Cabs (Tel: 6451234, Siyaram Street, Tonk Road, Durgapura) runs Pink Pepper, a pink double-decker bus whose upper deck doubles as a restaurant. The bus takes you around historic sights, and you can go in for a breakfast tour (8.30 am-12.30 pm), snack tours (1.30-3 pm, 4-5.30 pm, 6.30-8 pm) or a dinner tour (9-10.30 pm). Fares range from Rs 175 to 325. Camel cart tours of Rajasthani villages are arranged by the Hotel Bissau Palace (Tel: 2304371) at Rs 950 per head (Rs 750 per head for a group of seven; charges inclusive of lunch).|`|7FPejFJQaa	The most exciting part of the trip is having dinner on top of a bus for the first time.

xSHRJw46aa	Something to consider is that the difference in price between a 6 and a 10 day ticket is $12.  You can have more options that way.  You can just head to the park when you get there to see the fireworks, or you can swim at the hotel in the morning and go to Epcot in the evening.  Lots of options.<br>  <br>  I, for one, prefer to have the park hopper option so that I can go to multiple parks in one day.  It's an additional $50 though.  I know that on our last few days we like to go to multiple parks and do our favorite stuff.  That's just us though.<br>  <br>  As for your itinerary, I think it sound like a blast.

As the starting point of Penang's multicultural community, the inner city of George Town has many houses of worship, guilds, mosques, temples, clanhouses, district associations, sanghams and lodges which are Penang's 'open museums' of migration and cultural history. The many heritage tour guides are only too happy to reveal to the visitor the beauty and wonder, and the inspiration and spiritual meaning that lie behind each building, each community and each culture. <br>  21) A nimble amble through the historical sights in George Town: the first four streets mapped out by city fathers in George Town, namely Beach Street, Light Street, Pitt Street (now Jalan Mesjid Kapitan Keling) and Chulia Street are still very much relevant and bustle with traffic everyday. Just around the corner from Beach Street lies the Colonial Quarter, where Fort Cornwallis, Esplanade, City Hall, Court-house, St. George's Church, Convent Light Street, Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion, the Protestant Cemetery, and other historical buildings are situated. <br>  22) A short distance away are what is described as the historic port settlements or 'ethnic enclaves' – the Little India commercial orb, Kapitan Keling mosque, Goddess of Mercy Temple, Mahamariamman Temple, Armenian Street, Acheen Street, Khoo Kongsi, King Street, Weld Quay and others|`|0exde9VEaa	Eat Penang Prawn Mee & Penang Char Kway Theu ....& Penang Laksa ...|`|k5A4i2Nyaa	well, penang is actually famous for its hawker food.

36a3ynpJaa	Japanese shows can be very funny but they are very odd since they are based on embarrassing and torturing people.  One of my favorite shows took place in a marine park where they had a small shack overlooking the Piranhas.  They were showing people the pictures of what could happen to a cow if it got eaten then they dropped a big fish into the water.  The water boiled up for about a minute then they pull the fish bones out.  Just then, the guy doing the demonstration gets a phone call and steps outside. <br>  <br>  Now we see what is really happening.  They have a giant speaker under the shack and six Japanese body builders.  They speaker starts playing a rumbling sound and the body builder tip the shack into the pond.  The floor is waxed so the person inside is dumped into the pond screaming.  Then we see the underwater camera and there is a guy in a wet suit(who switched the fish for the bones on the fishing line) and he starts pinching the guy who fell into the water.  The guy is screaming in fear thinking he is being eaten alive.  Then he finally figures out it's all a prank and has to be polite and say "oh you got me good, very funny!"<br>  <br>  I saw them do this to about six celebrities and I was laughing so hard I could hardly breath. This is pretty typical of a Japanese show though.  In another one, they had a contest to see who would keep their legs in a box full of bees and someone underneath was putting clothes pins on their legs.  Seeing how long someone can suffer is big in Japan.<br>  <br>  As for movies, Sanjuro is good as well as Tampopo.  Tampopo is only about 20 years old and set in modern Tokyo.  It's very funny.  Most of the films I know are Samurai though. The Hidden Fortress, Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Samurai Banners.|`|752a09253c730785a794709c07fc1192aa	The Super Sentai series. it's available on Veoh|`|zWCSDiP8aa	here is my list of good j-dramas:<br>  - hana kimi + hana kimi sp (horikita maki, oguri shun, ikuta toma)<br>  - attention please + sp 1 +sp 2 (ueto aya, nishikido ryo)<br>  - gokusen (seasons 1,2,3) (nakama yukie)<br>  - hana yori dango (seasons 1,2, final) (inoue mao, matsumoto jun, oguri shun, shota masuda)<br>  - 1 littoru no namida (1 litre of tears) (nishikido ryo)<br>  - my boss my hero (2006) (tegoshi yuya, tanaka koki, tokio member)<br>  - yukan club (2007) (akanishi jin and others)<br>  - hanayome to papa (2007) (taguchi junnosuke, ishihara satomi)<br>  - ichi pound no fukuin/1 pound gospel (2008) (kamenashi kazuya, kuroki meisa)<br>  - kami no shizuku (2009) (kamenashi kazuya)<br>  - rescue (2009) (yamamoto yusuke, masuda takahisa, nakamaru yuichi)<br>  - code blue (2008) (yamashita tomohisa)<br>  - innocent love (2008) (horkita maki)<br>  - koizora (drama) 2008 (seto koji)<br>  - bloody monday (2008) (miura haruma, sato takeru)<br>  - mei-chan no shitsuji (2009) (eikura nana)<br>  - rookies (sato takeru and others)<br>  - puzzle (2008) (kimura ryo, yamamoto yusuke, ishihara satomi)<br>  <br>  there's a whole lot more awesome dramas but i hope these are good enough for now.<br>  <br>  hope that helped :D|`|9y2Qd6aLaa	"Taiyou no Uta" is a good movie with singer/actress YUI in it.<br>  <br>  "One Litre of Tears" is a bit depressing, but it has a deeping meaning.

Day ticket cost about $15 AUD you can go to a lot of place (ask information from the inf. booth). With this ticket you can use train, furry, bus...unlimited for the whole day. A lot of Pubs or Clubs for your fun time, night out...they are happy time that you can buy the drink less than $4/drink (beers, house wine, vodka+juice). Go to the beach at this time may be just for photos..because it quite cold to get in the sea..but if you don't mind..go for swim! okay. So many variety of foods here..if not much budget just go to the food court, it a lot of them in supermarket, shopping malls..lot of foods. For shopping just go to paddy market but only open on Thursday to Sunday and Public Holiday..A lot of thing you can do depend on your budget?

ZwG5aAVyaa	I agree with cpinatsi, except one thing.<br>  A good place to live, depends on what you're looking for. But i can understand these days why a 'job opportunity' could also mean 'a good place to live'. <br>  Would you like to live in a big city like Athens, Kalamata or Patra in Peloponnese,or Thessaloniki? With all the advantages and disadvantages of a big city? <br>  Would you like to live in a smaller place like Nafplio in Peloponnese, Parga in Preveza,Larisa in Thessalia (which by the way has many university students and that means 'life' for a city), Chalkida in Evia.<br>  Or would you like to live somewhere in an island with 'busy' summers and 'quite' winters? Like in ...well...almost every island!<br>  Or something in between? Like Chania in Crete, or Rhodes island or Corfu?<br>  <br>  A good idea is to start as an english teacher in private language schools, it will be much easier to find a job anywhere in Greece.<br>  please read this, it's usefull (it has info for teacher'license)<br>  <a href="http://www.onlinetefl.com/tefl-jobs/country-guides/greece.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinetefl.com/tefl-jobs/coun...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.eslbase.com/advice/greece.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.eslbase.com/advice/greece.asp</a><br>  <a href="http://www.jobmonkey.com/teaching/greece/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jobmonkey.com/teaching/greece...</a><br>  <br>  Greek National Tourism Organisation<br>  <a href="http://www.gnto.gr/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gnto.gr/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  about the Greek way of life i'm giving you a link of a previous Y!A question 'cause it's too much to write down <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArxiD0DZ3hpgsFLivZ1JVWXty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090217133415AA3M74E&show=7#profile-info-gCeAPaVlaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  cpinatsi is right, you could ask a priest for a greek school in the USA.
AEyztU2laa	Some schools will have streamed classes and if you meet the criteria to be in higher streams you'll be put in them.<br>  <br>  High school in New Zealand tends to be at a higher level than the United States.  If people at high schools in New Zealand are going to an American university it is very easy to get accepted after Year 12 which is the equivalent of a junior year at an American high school. It would be very rare for someone to bother with the equivalent of a senior year if going to university in the United States as it would be rather like repeating a level of study. Maths tends to be at a higher level, especially if you take the classes focusing on calculus rather than statistics.  Several sciences are also taught at a higher level.<br>  <br>  If you want an extra challenge you could try learning Maori or another Pacific language.  Many schools will teach it and learning languages is a great way to challenge yourself.  Try new sports such as cricket or rugby or take history, especially if your school has a class focused on New Zealand history.|`|r0HYuHubaa	NA - high school in NZ is pretty slack...We got this NCEA thing - not too effective - means pretty much any dummy can get into University...<br>  <br>  As long as you pass the NCEA tests you'll be fine..Trust me they are no way near as hard as AP classes

Hmm. . .<br>  <br>  If you would ask me, I would never have a plastic surgery done on my body. Even though I had trillions of pesos, I am totally contented in my body. Why impress others with big boobs? Why flatter men with those stupid-looking hips?<br>  <br>  But of course, other Filipinos would have it. They want their body to be perfect or somewhat to seduce men or women.

yXx1nB0Qaa	What part of May? The Camping season doesn't start until the May Long weekend, May 18th this year. Another option if you just want to make miles as you cross the prairies is Wal-Mart parking lots. Their corporate policy is to encourage RV'rs to park overnight in their parking lots. I doubt they intend for you to set up and actually camp their but if it is late and you are just looking for a place to park for the night its a good free option. Also rest stops are far fewer and much less elaborate than in the States.|`|8fRodbOQaa	While driving from BC to Montreal  in early May a few years ago I saw several gift shops that were closed for the season with signs indicating that RV's were welcome to use the parking lot.

Many airlines don't allow minors to travel unaccompanied. Beyond that, the biggest rule in international travel when you are alone, especially, is: don't talk too much. The Philippines is not without its dangers for children, and personally, you should not travel there alone. But if you go anywhere, answer questions asked of you by officials you know are in the right place doing legitimate business, and by no means offer unsolicited information to anyone. And know at all times the escape route to the nearest Embassy for your country.|`|sLTxHzHwaa	if you fly with peole like jfk you are an unnaccompanied flyer wich means you can fly without parents

XgwRxueLaa	Assuming you are from BC there should be no problems for you on the Trans Canada, though you need to watch for and obey winter travel advisory signs like slide zone when you get into the mountains.

There are no free guest houses, if there were I would live in one myself to save from paying high rent!  Working without a valid visa is illegal.<br>  $2000 might get you one round trip ticket, that's about it.  You might not even have enough left to last you 4-5 days if you include all costs.

You should really have at least $2000 if you want to go for just a week incl airfare.  $5000 minimum if you want to stay long enough to find a job.  They will not let you into the country without a return ticket, btw.  Knuckle down and find some work here you can put a lot of hours into.  Japan is full of people who wanted to go there and then find they can't get a job or a place to stay.  I lived there for six months and I don't think I could make it there now.

You'd be picked up by the police and deported.That means you couldn't return to Japan for at least 5 years.Your best bet would be to save up a few thousand dollars to you can go there and stay in a hotel.

Take a summer course in Moscow State University or Saint Peterbsurg State University or Herzen University in Saint Petersburg and stay there for a couple months.

5ZtSR0IQaa	I think you're overlooking the obvious and how things were done and still works. Call up a travel agent.<br>  <br>  Not all travel agents may be familiar or good with making reservations in Japan. That's when a Japanese travel agency comes in handy. JTB is the largest travel agency in Japan, so their resources and experience are extensive, even if you have to become one of their many customers. You'd have to call them up if you want a JR Pass anyway.<br>  <a href="http://www.jtbusa.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jtbusa.com/</a><br>  The idea is to call them up and talk to a living breathing travel agent.<br>  <br>  Your Japanese Guesthouses website looks legitimate, but I doubt they're really doing it for free. All travel agents get a commission from the hotel when they make a reservation for the customer. The standard commission is 5% in Japan, so that's how travel agents make their money when you reserve through them.|`|DuWlTyVXaa	Go with the Japanese guesthouse site ,I've used it and been happy with the help.Also Information centres at JR stations can and will make reservations or inquiries to the guesthouse association for you at short notice.Some of the international airports in Japan have booking counters for Ryokans and Minshuku's, Kansai (Osaka) airport had this facility the last time I was there (check airport site for operating hours of these facilities,some close at 8pm others earlier)|`|MyCGNdOoaa	The following website are in English: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.japaneseguesthouses.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.japaneseguesthouses.com/index...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ryokan.or.jp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ryokan.or.jp/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.tabiplaza.net/japanhotels/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tabiplaza.net/japanhotels/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/arrange/accomodations/links.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/arrange/accomo...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|36a3ynpJaa	I just walked in for the one Ryokan I stayed in and they didn't speak any English at all.

84Z0QS2zaa	I don't think most people in L.A. have been to Catalina and the ones who have don't go really often. I think that's because the expense of the boat, food, shopping, tours it all adds up. And so many of the things they offer there you can do on the mainland. Not that there aren't things to do unique to the island, there are and I think everyone who has the opportunity to go should try it at least once.<br>  <br>  It costs $66.50 round-trip now. We used to take one of the slower cheaper boats that used to leave from San Pedro. I think they only ran during the summer, maybe they still do. I haven't been there in more than 3 years. When my nephews were growing up we would take them when they came out to visit. They loved the boat ride. To me that was the more enjoyable experience. I don't swim or do the other type of activities that are offered there - scuba diving, snorkeling, kayaking, etc. We did rent a golf cart the last time we were there. That was different and sort of fun.<br>  <br>  I think these websites are good for people considering going over there.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ecatalina.com/catalina-visit.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecatalina.com/catalina-visit....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catalinachamber.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catalinachamber.com/</a><br>  <br>  Transportation<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catalinaexpress.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.catalinaexpress.com/index.php</a><br>  <a href="http://www.catalinaclickmap.com/golfcart/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.catalinaclickmap.com/golfcart...</a>|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	It actually IS a nice getaway. Surprisingly, most people in LA haven't gone there. <br>  <br>  Boat fare isn't too much. You can even stay overnight, which doesn't have to break the bank.<br>  <br>  Cars? No. Roads here are not all paved. Catalina is really a throwback in time. It's faster to take a boat from one side of the island to the other than to take a car. There are very few cars on the island itself.<br>  <br>  People who go there go to get away from the hustle of LA.|`|xDvtRVBJaa	I love Catalina! You can go for a day or a weekend and still have fun.<br>  It's usually $45 round trip per person and the most popular docks are Long Beach or San Pedro. You cannot take a car, as Catalina is a small Island. You will have to leave your car parked over at the docks from where you will be departing/arriving. Residents have said that you need to have a lot of  money and you need to be on a waiting list to purchase a car there. Catalina drives mostly in golf carts. You can rent a golf cart, but you have to be at least 25. <br>  <br>  Catalina has a lot of water activities: jet ski, snorkel, scuba dive, submarines, kayak, parasail, etc. The activities are usually expensive in the summer, but you can usually talk the shops into charging you less than what they ask (especially in the spring). Catalina also has tours (but I didn't take one so I don't know how they are).<br>  <br>  The island is very small, so the hotel selection is very small as well as the dining areas. None of the Catalina hotels have pools/hot tubs. There is a restaurant called Steve's (a steakery/sea food place) and I love it! There is also a dennys/norms like restaurant that's perfect for breakfast and lunch. There is only 1 bar and no dance clubs. <br>  <br>  I am going back for my birthday. I can't afford the luxury of Hawaii so Catalina is the next best thing..|`|AA10776535	I stayed 4 days there and was bored to death...one day would have been enough.  You cant bring your car you can rent golf carts but watch out the police will pull you over in them LOL Happened to me, guess i was speeding or maybe it was the little old lady i ran over,,,i don't know LOL They also have horseback riding if your into that, i think that was 1 1/2 hour tour thing.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	It's probably worth the trip.

B3FBgxjEaa	Death<br>  In Judaism, death is not a tragedy, even when it occurs early in life or through unfortunate circumstances. Death is a natural process. Our deaths, like our lives, have meaning and are all part of G-d's plan. In addition, we have a firm belief in an afterlife, a world to come, where those who have lived a worthy life will be rewarded.<br>  <br>  Mourning practices in Judaism are extensive, but they are not an expression of fear or distaste for death. Jewish practices relating to death and mourning have two purposes: to show respect for the dead (kavod ha-met), and to comfort the living (nihum avelim), who will miss the deceased.<br>  <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/death.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsou...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chabad.org/generic_cdo/aid/266275/jewish/Death-Mourning.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chabad.org/generic_cdo/aid/26...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.uscj.org/soeast/columbus/mourning_custom.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.uscj.org/soeast/columbus/mour...</a>|`|H4isBL4jaa	also when the desceased passes away he is buried hte same day!! Jews dont keep the body.. and they are buried in the ground.. no coffin or casket!! but it is hte tradition for both israeli and islam|`|YSXDTs3Eaa	Mourning is done in three phases: Shivah--first 7 days after burial, sh'loshim--first 30 days, and shannah--which is actually 11 months during which the mourner goes to synagogue and recites Kaddish.
VDgzbaREaa	Hey buddy,<br>                  Hindus don't float the bodies into the river after the death of a person, they  reduce (a dead body) to ashes by fire, esp. as a funeral rite. This process is called cremation. I am not sure about the use of cow urine. Cow dung becomes a good fuel after it's water evaporates. Cow is a holy animal, according to hindu religion. All hindus worship cow as a mother.<br>  <br>  I am a hindu, belong to India, we go for the cremation rather then floating. May be the people who don't have money for the cremation do float, the bodies into river.<br>        As I said they might be having their reasons for floating, it would be worth mentioning here that they float the bodies in the rivers which they believe are very holy. <br>                 They believe by floating the bodies in the holy river the soul of the dead person gets heaven.<br>                 However , I strongly appose the floating and it is totally banned in  the modern Indian society. For me, I am 26 yr old. I belong to a modern society and I have neither seen a floating dead body in river nor seen  kids playing around with the dead bodies floating in the rivers.<br>                 Floating could be prevalent in backward areas here but that is really unhealthy for the environment.<br>  <br>  --Prafull kulshrestha|`|cWuumdy7aa	After the death of a family member, the relatives become involved in ceremonies for preparation of the body and a procession to the burning or burial ground. <br>  For most Hindus, cremation is the ideal method for dealing with the dead, although many groups practice burial instead; infants are buried rather than cremated. At the funeral site, in the presence of the male mourners, the closest relative of the deceased (usually the eldest son) takes charge of the final rite and, if it is cremation, lights the funeral pyre. <br>  <br>  After a cremation, ashes and fragments of bone are collected and eventually immersed in a holy river. After a funeral, everyone undergoes a purifying bath. The immediate family remains in a state of intense pollution for a set number of days (sometimes ten, eleven, or thirteen). <br>  <br>  At the end of that period, close family members meet for a ceremonial meal and often give gifts to the poor or to charities. <br>  <br>  A particular feature of the Hindu ritual is the preparation of rice balls (pinda) offered to the spirit of the dead person during memorial services. In part these ceremonies are seen as contributing to the merit of the deceased, but they also pacify the soul so that it will not linger in this world as a ghost but will pass through the realm of Yama, the god of death.|`|nVQtiU5baa	Hindu Funerals  <br>  <br>  Hindus believe in reincarnation and view death as the soul moving from one body to the next on its path to reach Nirvana, heaven. Death is a sad occasion, but Hindu priests emphasise the route ahead for the departed soul and a funeral is as much a celebration as a remembrance service.<br>  <br>  Hindus cremate their dead, believing that the burning of a dead body signifies the release of the spirit and that the flames represent Brahma, the creator.<br>  <br>  Family members will pray around the body as soon as possible after death. People will try to avoid touching the corpse as it is considered polluting. The corpse is usually bathed and dressed in white, traditional Indian clothes. If a wife dies before her husband she is dressed in red bridal clothes. If a woman is a widow she will be dressed in white or pale colours. <br>  <br>  The funeral procession may pass places of significance to the deceased, such as a building or street. Prayers are said here and at the entrance to the crematorium.<br>  <br>  The body is decorated with sandalwood, flowers and garlands. Scriptures are read from the Vedas or Bhagavad Gita. The chief mourner, usually the eldest son or male, will light some kindling and circle the body, praying for the wellbeing of the departing soul.<br>  <br>  After the cremation, the family may have a meal and offer prayers in their home. Mourners wash and change completely before entering the house after the funeral. A priest will visit and purify the house with spices and incense. This is the beginning of the 13-day mourning period when friends will visit and offer their condolences.<br>  <br>  Often, a garland of dried or fake flowers is placed around a photograph of the deceased to show respect for their memory.<br>  <br>  'Shradh' is practiced one year after the death of the person. This can either be an annual event or a large one-off event. This is the Hindu practice of giving food to the poor in memory of the deceased. A priest will say prayers for the deceased and during this time, usually lasting one month, the family will not buy any new clothes or attend any parties. Sons are responsible for carrying out Shradh.|`|vVp4iJZVaa	I saw the pics and am indeed speechless. They look real but don't know if this is a funeral practice that happens in India. Hope not! Using cow urine does make sense b/c it is a holy animal for Hindu. Things happen around the world but not everything that happens has a legitimate reason.|`|LddkW0JFaa	India is a third world country. There is a smell because they lack the sewers we have in the west. People are very poor and many things we take for granted are out of the question there.|`|BTxHsV07aa	yes|`|YNcpwJrsaa	Yes, I would give an answer for that. <br>  <br>  First of all Hindus do not throw the dead bodies in water. They burn the body and remaining ash is thrown in deep flowing water of River Ganga. <br>  <br>  I don’t know what pics you saw, if you saw some thing what you mentioned then let me tell you what you saw in those photos is not real practice. I can show you 1000’s of Islamic photos doing worst things than what you saw. That doesn’t mean that it is real practice in Islam.<br>  <br>  Coming back to Cows urine and dung. Cow is 100% veg animal and there are certain subtle elements, which keeps negative energies away from humans like Garlic, Urine of Veg eating divine animal like cow.<br>  <br>  Garlic is still use in middle-east by Gypsies as remedy over bad spirits. They tie garlic bunch to their bed legs and sleep.<br>  <br>  So while performing funeral rituals bad spirits and energies around don’t come around because of cow’s urine.<br>  <br>  If you want more information of what really happens after the death, please see it on <a href="http://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/articles/id/spiritualresearch/spiritualscience/afterdeath" rel="nofollow">http://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.o...</a><br>  <br>  It may be noted that it is not Hindu site.

(we always had parking, one the perks of traveling on offical business).  but i would not drive my private vehicle in that city for nothing. too much traffic, you will burn a tank of gasoline on a bad day, and run out on a worse day if something like a lock down in a section occurs as it seems do do.<br>  <br>  someone somewhere is always scared when they hear a noise like concrete being dumped in a comericial dumpster, or a car back fire.<br>  <br>  enjoy|`|Y0F9VeVcaa	No. People are ridiculous.

GWU is located in the northwest part of town. The northwest section is full of coffee shops and art galleries. It is an upscale neighborhood. The worst part of town is the northeast section. If you stay in the northwest section and the downtown area (near the national mall) then you'll be safe.|`|2EVoNHHbaa	"Hello" summed it up correctly.  The part of DC you'll be in is not overly dangerous.  But, GWU doesn't have a formal campus as such--there are no gates around the campus, and no central grassy quad.  It's basically a number of city blocks where all or virtually all of the buildings are owned and operated by the university.  With that sort of arrangement, anybody can walk through the campus.

eAMbWkahaa	What country are you from and how old are you?<br>  <br>  A Working Holiday Visa is designed for people who want to come visit Japan, while working part time to help pay for their trip.<br>  <br>  The Working Holiday Visa is only granted to people from:<br>      * Australia<br>      * Canada<br>      * Denmark<br>      * Germany<br>      * France<br>      * Ireland<br>      * Korea<br>      * New Zealand<br>      * United Kingdom <br>  And usually you have to be between the ages of 18-25 in most cases.(in some exceptions up to age 30).<br>  <br>  Most hotels want you to speak both Japanese and English because the hotel will also have mostly Japanese staff, for example my French friend works at a hotel, but he speaks Japanese, French and English.<br>  <br>  The requirements for a Working Holiday Visa is less restrictive then a full work visa.  Working Holiday Visas are only valid for 6 months to one year only, and you can only get it once.<br>  <br>  If you are not from any of the countries listed or are not in the age range, then you need a FULL work visa.|`|2HOd9uTaaa	Some japanese hotels do look for english-speaking staff.

At least many enough to fulfill hotel jobs in Japan.<br>  <br>  It means that you can get a job if you already have visa to live in Japan, including the case that you are a Japanese citizen. If you are not, you can't get a job so easily.

At the time the decison over Canada's capital was made, there was much dispute that it should be Toronto or Montreal. the War of 1812 had shown how vulnerable major Canadian cities were to American attack, since they were all located very close to the border. Ottawa was (then) surrounded by a dense forest far from the border. Also, the government owned a large parcel of land on a spectacular spot overlooking the Ottawa River. Ottawa's position in the back country made it more defensible, while still allowing easy transportation via the Ottawa River to Canada East, and the Rideau Canal to Canada West.

But the Keeper of the Universe holds the final say. Do you deserve to be given wealth? Will you be responsible for it? Many wealthy people are such ugly characters that you simply know that they will experience a bitter death. <br>  <br>  If God loves you, would He give you something that will ultimately destroy your soul? 4D and stuff is purely a game of chance. It would not be fair if one person receives a benefit from it while others who've spent their lives hoping get nought. <br>  <br>  Ask God for prosperity, happiness, achievement, security, attainment, cars, houses.... Anything. And be ready to receive. My answer, yes you can ask but not for 4D.|`|ZswqMnQlaa	if all buddhists ask buddha to win in the 4d and they are all granted, where will 4d get the money to pay?<br>  <br>  my advice: get a job, put up a restoran or earn money with your abilities, winning lottery draws like this is like a shot to the moon.|`|LKgC9VQdaa	You can believe whatever you want though there are few true Buddhists around today just kids who believe in it because its the cool thing to do|`|5c873097b4af9f2a2cc6aeb0288d4ff5aa	relax they will not be angry since they r on top now<br>  remember they were once in our shoe too<br>  they know what the bottom r going thru too|`|0exde9VEaa	If you just ask and ask, and do not do good yourself, you are not a good Buddhist, and Buddha or Kuanyin or Hoi Lung Wong will not listen to you....you need to change your philosophy of asking ....|`|v3g2Ngicaa	oh no ! good person are not easily to get angry , they will easily apology on what you done wrong to them .
AA10523012	Foreign work contracts are not acknowleged by the UAE authorities. But by working in the UAE you also have a work contract with the Ministry of Labor of the UAE. Regarding the UAE Labor law limited contracts can not be in excess of a period of 4 years.<br>  <br>  You can resign by giving a 30 days notice. Then your company has to cancel your labor card and your visa. You will automatically receive a 6 months working ban which under certain circumstances can be lifted against paying fees to the Ministry of Labor.<br>  With a six months ban you are still able to obtain a visit visa and can take employment at any Free Zone company.<br>  <br>  Hope this answered your question.

ZPxJNpMxaa	Well, the challenges facing SA are still very much the same, poverty, HIV/AIDS, corruption, fraud and nepotism in government and crime.<br>  <br>  The ANC have not shown much progress, if any, in these major areas of concern over the past 2 years, their priority seems to be lining their own pockets at the expense of the taxpayer....in my view their overall performance in these major areas can only be described as pathetic and even that appears somewhat complimentary.<br>  <br>  So based on this info you can decide whether it is appropriate for you to return just yet.<br>  <br>  The good news is that we go to the polls in a couple of months and there has been a breakaway group, Cope, from the ANC that have formed an opposition party to the ANC.<br>  <br>  Our hope now is that the opposition parties succeed in reducing the ANC power base and that we will end up with a stronger opposition which hopefully translates into overall better governance......I am not optimistic that the ANC will be toppled.<br>  <br>  With the selection of Jacob Thug Zuma as the ANC candidate for President I really believe that SA, from an international perspective, must be at an all time low.......he optimise's everything that a good leader and statesman is not....shame.<br>  <br>  Whether to return to SA or not is a personal decision that only you can make....let us hope that things do improve, SA citizens deserve at least this but if ZUMA is made President my view is that things will get worse not better, under his clock it would not surprise me if bestiality is legalised, the man simply has no morality.|`|2UomwjfEaa	The crime rate has decresed ever so slightly.

It is impossible to find someone with that scant information. <br>  <br>  I assume the employer would know the person's surname that could help... didn't you think to ask for that when you asked where he went?

LT346Ov8aa	My husband and I are stationed at Fort Campbell and we live off post. We live in a townhome, but it is only two bedrooms. I know there are lots of houses around here that people rent, but I'm not sure how much they are or if they accept pets so I can't really help you with that. My husband and I get bored easily too, but unfortunately there is just not that much to do around here. It's pretty hard to "stay away" from Clarksville because it is where everything is and it's the biggest town around Fort Campbell. All the other towns around Fort Campbell are tiny and have nothing. If you take Hwy 374 across to Wilma Rudolph Blvd. there is a mall with a movie theater, lots of stores like Best Buy, Kohl's, Target, etc. The majority of restaurants are over on Wilma Rudolph Blvd. too. So there's some shopping, restaurants, a couple movie theaters (there's another bigger one on Tiny Town Rd.), and that's about it. Oh, there's a dog park here that's not bad if you want to let your dog run around when it's nice outside. Other than that, it's pretty boring.|`|JoVrAhAVaa	nope|`|MgA4Knoxaa	Im not sure.

Q3RqWHFsaa	Unfortunately speaking, because Philippines has no visa waiver treaty with Japan so that you have to ask somebody in Japan (it is not necessary to be Japanese citizen or not) who can be your guarantor to apply COE to the immigration office in advance to your departure . <br>  <br>  I think usually travel agency in Japan can support you if paid and your husband guarantees them you together.<br>  <br>  After receiving your COE through the guarantor, you are able to apply travel visa to the Japanese embassy in Taiwan. Your hus have no need to ask any visa in advance. He will be given 90days stay for travel on arrival because he has Taiwanese passport.<br>  <br>  Without this procedure, you won't be granted to enter into Japan even you fly over to Japan with your hus who is eligible. It takes more than one month to get the visa. Very annoying but It is rule.|`|AA10662056	In case of Philippines national, you need a Japanese citizen who can guarantee your status when you are in Japan to get a visa.|`|eAMbWkahaa	You have to apply for a Temporary Visitor's permit (this is the official name for what people often incorrectly call a tourist visa).<br>  <br>  As if you will be granted or not all depends on Immigration officials.  Contact the Japanese Embassy in the country you are in right now for more information on how to visit Japan.

95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	McAllister is probably Scottish. It's not a common name in Ireland, and any McAllisters here are likely to have come over with the great Plantations, several hundred years ago. <br>  <br>  Mac (Feminine form 'Nic') means son of (or daughter of) in both Scotch Gaelic and what we in Ireland refer to as Irish or Gaeilge. O (or feminine form 'Ni') refers more to a chieftain's retinue and followers, which is why there are so many 'O'Briens' in Ireland, as Brian Boru was the last High King. You can certainly have both in Ireland, and possibly in Scotland too. Many names used in Ireland did at one point have a Mac in front of them, but some families chose to drop it.|`|afeoTehEaa	We know Orlaith McAllister right enough, and she's Irish.<br>  We enjoyed her shenanigans in the big house.|`|dqThzIbvaa	Theres alot of McAllister's in Ireland<br>  so im guessing Irish?|`|yRYsi5zpaa	It could be both actually.

9y2Qd6aLaa	The only way to get to Penghu is on airplane, I believe, unless you can get there by ship/boat.  It's about 1 hour on the plane. <br>  <br>  I recommend going to Taipei's 101; it's a well-known tourist location.  You could also take them to the Night Markets; the biggest one seems to be the one in Shilin.<br>  <br>  You might also take them to Yangmingshan National Park?  <br>  There are many trails to choose from, like <br>  Or the hot springs at Beitou or Wulai.  <br>  <br>  I recommend trying the Maokong Gondola because you can see a good view of the city.  It's best to go around 3 PM - 4 PM, because the line can get long, but you'd want to catch the sunset during your ride up the mountain.  When you reach the top, it's nice to have dinner there, because some restaurants offer outdoor seats, and you can see the city below.  It gets cool, so be sure to bring a thin jacket.  <br>  <br>  Taipei zoo is a good destination, as well.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could take them to Confucius Temple, or Xingtian temple?  <br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!!<br>  I hope this helped!!|`|VFTJJr3Qaa	How about Kenting instead of Penghu? it would cost you a lot to fly to Penshu...i think maybe you could take them to 奮起湖, right now the weather is cool there and it's nice to walk aroud in the forest. :)<br>  <br>  Have fun!

The venue puts on live bands more or less every night of the week, and often there are three or four acts performing over the course of the evening. If you want a break from the live music, retire to the bar section where there are plenty of other seats. The cave-like surroundings make it one of the most unique settings in the city. It also hosts one of the capital's most popular karaoke nights. <br>  <br>  Henry's Cellar Bar<br>  <br>  Address: 8 Morrison St, Tollcross, Edinburgh EH3 8BJ<br>  <br>  Henry's Cellar Bar attracts students and young adults who wish to hear the experimental live bands that frequent this place.

(kao)|`|9y2Qd6aLaa	The first:<br>  "The moon is beautiful." <br>  You could say:<br>  "[Ano] tsuki wa kirei deshou?", "[Ano] tsuki wa kirei [desu] ne?", "[Ano] tsuki wa kirei da.", "[Ano] tsuki wa kirei desu.", "[Ano] tsuki wa kirei [da] na?"  <br>  The one closest to your phrase is probably the statement.  The question marked ones are seeking agreement, and translate somewhat like, "Isn't the moon beautiful?"<br>  "Da" is informal, while "desu" is formal.  It depends on how close your characters are/how comfortable they are with eachother in order for you to know which one to use.  <br>  -<br>  Second:<br>  "Your hair, your cheeks, and your heart as well, all belong to me."<br>  You would say:<br>  "Omae/Anata/Kimi no kami to kao to kokoro ha boku/watashi/ore no da/desu." <br>  Omae/Anata/Kimi: all mean "you", in descending respect order<br>  Boku/watashi/ore: all mean "I/me", in descending respect order <br>  -<br>  "I love you." <br>  You could say:<br>  "Aishiteru.", "Daisuki da/desu [yo]." <br>  In my opinion, and from what I've usually heard, it seems like mostly only married couples might use, "Aishiteru." because it is such an intimate phrase.  "Aishiteru." means "I love you." but "love" in Japan and "love" in America is seen differently.  "Daisuki" is more like, "I really, really like you/I like you a lot.", so it evades the word "love".  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!<br>  I hope this helped!!|`|7wAdC1Enaa	Google|`|g2SCyk8waa	heck go to google

Then there won't be any stamps in it showing when you last came and went<br>  <br>  And since you have a teaching job, speak to your school about sponsoring you for a work visa so you are doing it legally. <br>  <br>  I don't know about any country being lenient about stamping. I've been to Italy 3 times in the past 2 years on a US passport and it's been stamped every time - in Rome, Venice and Milan. It was probably just a fluke that yours wasn't stamped.<br>  <br>  Also passports are now scanned anyway, so your arrivals and departures are all recorded on a database. So whether you have a stamp or not, it will show your European arrival and departure dates next time you enter the EU.|`|0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	These days, passports are generally scanned when you check in for a flight and sometimes upon arrival. The stamps don't matter so much anymore, passport control still knows your entry and exit dates.<br>  <br>  Italy and Spain are both part of the Schengen area, which means your visa overstay applies to all of those countries. Not having an Italian stamp doesn't mean anything, if there is a record of you coming into Spain, but not one of you leaving Schengen within 90 days. The only way a "they didn't stamp it" story would work is if you managed to get on and off a flight without handing anyone your passport.. which is very unlikely.<br>  <br>  I've had friends that were caught upon departure and fined heavily, in various countries. I've also had friends that left without incident. It seems to be a matter of luck, although some airports are particularly strict about checking details.<br>  <br>  The real problem is returning. I don't know anyone that's overstayed recently that didn't receive a travel ban to Schengen (usually for 5 years). In past years it was possible, but newer passports and passport control measures make it less likely. Your best chance of staying would have been to apply for a work and residence permit before you overstayed. At this point, I think you'd have to find a way to avoid passport controls into Schengen completely. You can check with your local embassy for advice.

Clearly, you knew the consequences.<br>  <br>  However, what is even more puzzling to me is that mothers nowadays seem to think that THEY have control over their child's life - "Should I let them live and deal with raising them, or should I have an abortion and murder them cold-bloodedly?"  That's not quite your choice. Think of it this way - if your mother had decided to end her pregnancy and said she "was just not ready" to have you - you wouldn't be here right now. You're here because she didn't do that. Your name is not God, and it's not your choice. Have the baby and give it up for adoption to a loving home where the people will take care of it. Doing more wrong doesn't make it more right, by any means.|`|rYNM67oyaa	Don't use abortion when you should have used birth control.

yvDb0hBmaa	I would try a combination of the two circuits.    I think Laos is the one of the most special places in the world. Peaceful and beautiful with gentle people. Suggest a few days in Vientiane and Luang Prabang. Then on to Vietnam - Hanoi to see the old French neighborhoods and Ho Chi Minh City to see the bustling financial capital. You could also spend some time navigating your way between the two cities, and seeing the incredible geogrpahic beauty and diversity of the country.    If visiting Angkor Wat is a priority, spend a couple of days in Siem Reap, otherwise you might skip Cambodia entirely. Phnom Penh has the feel of an outlaw town and I would avoid it.    You can then cap your trip with a few days in the modern splendor of Singapore. I haven't been to Malaysia, but you can easily build in a side trip to Kuala Lumpur or Penang.    Bon voyage!    Days 1-5  Vientiane  6-10 Luang Prabang  11-15 Hanoi  16-18 Travel south in Vietnam (Hue, Nha Trang, Dalat)  19-23 Ho Chi Minh City  24-30 Singapore (w/ Malaysia side trip)|`|4c38113c8d557a298cd8900a1ee5fc25aa	Go north.

eD7qRBKHaa	Disney World hours change - check out the calendar for your exact dates here: http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/calenda...    Universal hours are here: http://theorlandovacationstore.com/Unive...    If you stay at a Disney hotel, you are allowed to have Extra Magic Hours.  A Disney park either opens early or stays open late.  Used to, you had to check-in and get a wristband on the days where the park stayed open late so that they would know it was ok for you to ride.  Now, they are just having you show your key/ticket so they can check it.  So you cannot get this perk unless you are staying at a Disney resort, but if you stay at a Disney resort, it is free.|`|q9NPU952aa	The park hours for Disney and Universal vary depending upon the park and the day of the week.  Your best bet is to go to each website (www.disney.com and www.universalstudios.com) to check out the hours for each day you will be there.    The Extra Magic Hours benefit (wristband) is available only to guests staying on Disney resort property.  If you are staying on-property, you will get a schedule of which parks have Extra Magic hours which days when you check-in.  Then, you can go to that park early or stay late.  Sometimes they require wristbands (you will see cast members in the park giving these out) and sometimes they require you to show your Key to the World to enter the rides.  I have been there when they have done both.     Have a great trip!|`|AA11100845	If you are staying at a Disney Resort you can get in on the Extra Magic Hours. Those are early and late hours that the park is open for those staying on property. You get a wristband at the park, but you have to show that you're staying on property. I think you just show your key to the world (room card key)    Here is a link to park hours and a guide to which parks have EMH's available and those dates.    http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/calenda...    I don't have any info on Universal, but I'm sure if you look up their web site, there will be info or at least a   to call. Nevermind - here is a link to the site with that info.    http://www.universalorlando.com/hours-in...    Have fun!
RrEESD6Paa	You should definitely be able to find a great deal since it's so far away. I am going to give you the only piece of advice that was given to me for finding cheap travel deals, and it works to this day... Compare as many travel websites as you can as often as you can. Since you have a few months, start searching today and search the flights every week until the month before you are going. If anything is unusually cheaper, book it on that date. I would definitely recommend checking out BookMe. You can compare ALL the reputable travel sites from one location, and save tons of money. Good luck!|`|TdrpIkl4aa	try    wwwteletextholidays.co.uk  booked through them last year (to Benidorm) i think their prices are reasonable.|`|dCbIHBpGaa	There doesn't seem to be a lot of great deals about.

NrsstEEIaa	A flamenco show is a must see!  I have been both to Corral de la Moreria and Casa Patas, they are both awesome but unique in their own right.  Moreria is a bit pricier but it is extremely intimate and they have a variety of showtimes and food to order.  As for things to do during your days in Madrid I would suggest the El Palacio Real (Royal Palace) and El Prado (Museum).  You're bound to pass through El Puerto del Sol and that is worth hanging out in along with Plaza Mayor.  Grab lunch or tapas in either of these places and you'll fall in love with the view.  Madrid is an awesome city with loads and loads to do!  Good luck!|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Parque del Retiro, Palacio Real, Prado, and maybe, if you're into it, the Museo de la Reina Sofa (modern art) or the Thyssen Bournemazso (mixed periods of art).  Or, if it's Sunday, and you have the cash, Real Madrid might be in town...but the tickets are pricey!     Plaza Mayor is neat...if only for the history.      I don't know...I probably wouldn't spend much more than that, anyway, except that Madrid is so central, that it makes a good base for exploring some other parts of the area.|`|8a1c4efde714f3448706c28696452e2eaa	All the things mentioned are must sees.

cfv2utFQaa	There is less racism in Japan than other many countries. Basicly, it is political propaganda that Japanese are racists.    Hawever, as a Japanese, I have to say that Japanese have strong tendency to bully and harass the people who don't allow Japanese etiquets. Even among Japanese, there are strong fear to be bullied by other people around you, this is common problem when we go into other groups at the time we changing schools, company transfer, changing jobs or moving.     I think this is one of the reason why many foreigners feel discriminated and began to believe Japanese are racist even now.  Although this kind of bullying is a bad side of our culture, but it is absolutly not a racism.   In fact, most Japanese as a group try to assimilate someone, but they don't care if you are Japanese, Chinese, Indonesian, causasian or colored. I am a native Japanese, but if they (Japanese aound me) feel ME as a "foreigner", sometimes they bully me.    It is very difficult to make (or at least, ask) Japanese stop bullying "foreigners". It is getting improved slowly and slowly now but unfortunately it is a part of our culture.  My advice is that:   - Master Japanese as good as you can. (or you'll be thought as "foreigner" and harassed)   - Check Japanese etiquet as much as you can.   - Luckily, it has almost no relation to the color of your skin. Stupid people from US who expect that they should be tread well in Asia because they are "white" will be more harassed in Japan. (but again, it's not related to the race.)    Although Japanese don't care much about your skin color, appearance like Filipino will good for fit in Japanese society. I'm trying to say how lucky you are to make a good relation with Japanese people, more lucky than "white" people.    Japanese will always welcome people who act very disciplined as a mature adults (or rather good at your age).  Please relax and enjoy your stay in Japan.|`|e7576a139b6789e59e2195c707b6c228aa	It's not such a big deal. To Japanese people the DR=good baseball, and baseball is a very good thing in Japan. It's possible you might get asked for your gaikokujin torokusho more than a lily-white person would, but that's about all I can think of in terms of overt racism.|`|RPpXarDDaa	i'm not sure and i have heard the same thing. I have also heard there is a large number of latin americans living in japan especially from brazil. but there is no guarantee that there will receive you with open arms.    be cautious and be friendly is all i can say|`|aZXnW6AUaa	it varies|`|OTnSwNwZaa	Japanese tend to accept latinos, indians, arabs, etc. Not as much as whites, but they are accepted and treated as human.    Blacks on the other hand, are despised and considered to be animals. You'll have an alright time since you are latrino.|`|NCMZy6Uqaa	"how you behave is the reason why you are not welcomed.  vulgar people will receive bad treatment no matter where they came from and polite people will be welcomed regardless of how they look different from us."    I'm sorry to say that in Japan that is not the case, nor is racism like in any other country.  Besides the existing "Japanese (pople) only" signs in some places, if you feel you are mistreated because of your race, you can complain, but nothing is done about it. For instance, go to rent an apartment. Only around 10%-30% of real estate is available to foreigners. So basically, a Japanese (vulgar or not) usually has a better chance to obtain a place to live than a well behaved and polite foreigner.  A shop owner who expelled a black man from outside his shop was suited by said man. On court the owner said it did it  "because I hate blacks", and was acquitted by the judge.  Blackface acts are common on entertainment, and have many apologists ("Japanese don't have a history of enslaving people, so is not offensive".)  And so on.  The UN envoy sent to Japan to study this matters stated that Japan was lacking in ways to protect people from racial discrimination.      EDIT:  To the person who got deleted (they deleted his answer, but he ranted about me generalizing and being 'stupid", so I'll leave it here): First of all this is not a chat or discussion board. Read the Terms and Conditions.  This time only I will clarify some of your points.    Housing conditions: no interest or credit is involved, because usually the problem is renting, with monthly payments and several months of deposits in advance. And many agencies are not even interested if you have a good credit history or can or cannot pay, they simply reject you at the door or after the landlord asks, "is that person foreigner?".   Later I said, that most people don't behave that way and politeness is the rule most of time, but the bad cases of discrimination are really bad because legal protection is not guaranteed (like the specific case of the black man and the racist shop owner being acquitted by court, and also stated in the UN inform. Please, recognize an example when confronted with one). No generalization there.  I mainly agree with you in that Japan maybe has a smaller number of hard-core racists, but my point is that here they can do more damage and get on with it.  And I never said I was or felt discriminated (maybe a little disheartened on the real state case, but some of the people I know have. Example: a uni friend received written messages under her door form her neighbour about her "inferiority" of race and how she should go out of Japan. She was a PhD student sent by her her government to study in one of the most prestigious unis in Japan. The landlady said she didn't want to get involved. Police said they couldn't do anything.). If you infer that from my answer, then check again your deduction abilities.   Last, I enjoy my stay in Japan.      For "blackface act" (you deleted it, but anyway), you can use Yahoo Answers, a great tool when not misused by chatters and trolls, to get an answer, or Wikipedia if you are in a hurry.  Cheers.    PS: As for the "stupid" part, lol, now some people would be asking themselves, " so that guy is Japanese. Is that how Japanese treat people? Is just him or all Japanese like that?" You throw all your hard work out of the board with things like that.|`|vQTYDR1oaa	I think if you conduct yourself well, there's no need to fear.

Japan is 80% Mountains so there is not so much land to live, people are crammed together in cities and seeing outlanders in their soil is not well seen, also the majority of Japanese people is Shintoist but over the years Buddhism had been gaining popularity in Japan which they also see as an invasion.|`|2biWdmpIaa	you wanna travel? its OK. no problems.  wanna work here?

Some will be racist and some just won't care.|`|dbAWPWzraa	There are some racists but I don't know it is as many as other countries. It is the matter of you pay lot or less in Japan, not race.    There are many people from other countires in Tokyo, being a foreinger is not a big thing there. Most of Japanese people don't pay attention to you unless you act wierd. Actually they don't recognize whether you are hispanic or what, racism in Japan mostly comes from mere ignorance, which is ,of course, a bad thing.     You can find many friendly Japanese people though. Don't worry, just go. It is safe.    my latest:  I think TR hit the point about the racism. I did not think about the case when you live in. Just traveling around Japan, Japanese people are usually kind to "guests", but living in Japan would be different and difficult sometimes.   You need to find  and check a network or a window who can give you information there. Still, I hope you  make friends with some Japanese. Good luck.|`|WtYz6VKMaa	Ah, the person below me, you dont have to be sorry. I like seeing foreigners make  mistakes.    As for housing conditions...It is business. Nevertheless, what is wrong with the fact Japanese people have an easier access to real estate?I dont understand. I would not say bullshit like "I cannot make a credit card because I am a foreigner therefore canadians are racists" since no one would agree with me. Do you know this business principle?:Higher interests for a risky customer(Cost and return). I dont know why foreginers came to be considered risky but there should be reasons, obviously not a racism reason. Accusing business does not work because doing business is all about money, any bit of racism does not concern while you are tryina make money. If they know that they can make money from foreigners, they would do so.  Also, you picked up an independent event and made a whole lotta generalization: "there is this guy I know who said he does not like black people therefore Japanese people are racists." Among any population, there should be some individuals who discriminate certain group of people on unacceptable basis. Thus the reliability of generalization depends on the degree. As for Japan, I think it has a very moderate rate of so-called racists.(insofar as the type of foreigners who you are is concerned) compared to the US and other western nations. I would assume you are lying if you say that you felt discriminated against while you are in Japan.    My advice to foreigners:enjoy your stay in Japan not considering unchangeable truth. There are racists in every society, if you should encounter some of them, you are unlucky. But dont compare Japan with the US and other western nations. We know the history that distinguish Japan from western nations. Dont say Japan is racism country: this term only applies to western nations.            hahaha Thank you for posting responce even breaking the rule you have educated me.Having a consistency in your behavior is a good thing if you wanna become a good representative of foreigners in Japan.  as for the housing part, what people concern is not only the payment but other factor. dont get confused by my examples. My examples are to transfer my abstract thinking with the least cost, so dont say stupid things about interests and credit history. Other factors are that people dont want vulgar foreigners to live nearby. Ones like russians who are banned from otaru bathhouse(?).still it is not racism.They are afraid of vulgar people who do not have a consistency in their behavior.  I didnt think you wrote that you felt discriminated in Japan but I wrote it as a part of my claim that japan is not like the way you described.And it turned out to be true.Good. It is apparent that you are still making an overly generalization. Dont dig up some cases in favor of misleading people to believe that Japan is full of racists. you try to find some evidence of discrimination even though you didnt feel discriminated in Japan. Are you a racist too????  and your phd friend?do you want me to apologize to her about the aleged case????if that is the case are you planning to set a blind date for me or something?I dont know the whole story so nothing I can comment on that. But I think there is something behind it.    :  since I see too many wrong information on the internet, I need attetion. thank you for your concern. I think you will like me once we meet each other.(I dont wanna meet a Japan-hater like you though).|`|NTBaMjuNaa	Wear clean clothes and behave politely, and you will not have to worry at all.    A lot of people come to Japan (including Tokyo) from all over the world. A dirty and coarse person is hated even if they are Japanese.    The Japanese are likely to judge the others from how they look and behave, rather than what race or country they belong to.    (but to be honest, as a Japanese... )    There was a lawsuit over racism in a district court. A naturalized Japanese sued a public bath owner in a harbor city in the northern Japan. The accuser claimed that the owner rejected him for taking the bath because he was a foreigner, which was the violation to the international law.    Actually the owner had decided to expel foreigners, because of some Russian fishermen who had ignored the Japanese manner of taking the bath; they had polluted the place so much that some of the Japanese customers had gone away from it.     The court accepted the accuser's claim, however, the public opinion was divided over the judgment.     The Japanese government has strengthen the passport control to the foreigners, mainly because of the increasing crimes committed by foreigners. Even some of them visit Japan for the theft. Some of such crimes has become more atrocious recently so that the stance of the Japanese media may not be unreasonable.    Being a Hispanic can not be the reason for the discrimination at all, however, those who are truly ill-mannered enough to damage others might not be welcomed, although almost all are the exception, I know.

Look.. everyone seems to have their own point of view.. What is a definition of a terrorist? anyone or thing that strikes fear in the hearts,minds and souls of others? correct?... Well Bush certainly fit the bill for a terrorist leader in some other countries minds.. Ask any little child of Iraq what they tought of Bush... Ask any Palestinian child what they think of USA, supplying free military weapons to Israel under special programs of support...   Its all of what viewpoint you are looking from who is the terrorist.. Just cause Iran wont take the bullying tactics of USA, that makes them terrorists? Have they invaded anyone lately? NO..  America has weapons of mass destruction, nuclear bombs, and all the mass killing machines, tactics, of all, but yet they arent terrorists? They strong arm any country not willing to fit their mold of democracy, but they are not terrorists?.......

Dd14BZncaa	Bernard Street East is as central as you can get in Montreal. "East" means it is located East of St-Laurent Boulevard, the dividing line between East and West in Montreal. Bernard Street West leads you into the former city and now borough of Outremont.<br>  <br>  You can get there many ways, but all will require a minimum walk :  Take bus No. 80 North from Place-des-Arts station on the green Metro line or South from Parc station on the blue line Arts to Bernard West and walk a few blocks East along Bernard; take bus No. 55 from the Saint-Laurent station and get off at Bernard; take bus No. 161 at Rosemont station on the orange line and get off at St-Urbain (right after the overpass), then walk South a block or two and then East along Bernard.|`|AA10982716	The first answerer's map shows a street called Boulevard Pierre Bernard, in Ville d'Anjou I believe.<br>  <br>  I the second answerer is right, that Bernard E is just a couple blocks off St. Laurent.

ERNet, a division of Department of Electronics (DoE) and NICNet (Department of Statistics) are Indias first ISPs. ERNet was designed to provide Internet connectivity to the premier educational and research institutions of India, and NICNet was assigned the provision of Internet services primarily to Government departments and organizations.    ERNet become the first to provide full access to dial-up modem customers around 1993.Another provider of Internet services that preceded VSNL is the Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) Internet service. But, this service was permitted only for the software exporters falling under the STP scheme of the DoE.    On 15th August 1995, VSNL launched the Gateway Internet Access Service, for providing public Internet access.

Visit their websites and look at the park maps, then select which activities or animals that are a must see and make sure you visit those first.

To save on admission, here are discount coupons to San Diego Zoo, Wild Animal Park and Seaworld.  http://www.socalthemeparks.com/special-d...

My only suggestions would to definately do the tram at the Wild Animal Park.  Also, while the zoo and Sea World are by the ocean and can be cool even in July, the Wild Animal Park is inland and will be hotter than $*(( so be prepared.|`|A8frjLzuaa	On the day you go to the Wild Animal Park, get there early.  The animals are more active when it's cooler outside.  During the day, they tend to sleep more.  Parking at the WAP is not free, either.  It's around 10 bucks.  Check with AAA for discount Sea World tickets or seaworld.com.  They run specials sometimes.      The zoo has a lot of hills, so the kids may not like that.  If it's not included in your ticket, you may want to buy the bus trip when you get to the park (that way you can move around the park a bit more easily).      Some of the local motels have a special room rate/combo sea world package, including tickets, so that may be a cost effective alternative.     Have Fun!!

During this time places close down for afternoon "naps." So don't go shopping or expect to find a lot of places to eat or shop at during this time.    Dinner occurs very late (like after 9pm), but you can always find somewhere to eat when you are hungry.
aihogb26aa	Universal Islands of Adventure is definitely more of an amusement park/ thrill ride place than Disney. it works for all ages, but I would think it would be especially good for ages 10 and up. It would probably take about a full day to do everything there. Universal Studios is the "ride the movies" park. Those rides are a little tamer, but some could still be pretty intense for young ones. Universal Studios also takes about a full day to see. Universal City Walk in the Universal complex also has several fun theme restaurants like Bubba Gumps, Hard Rock and Margaritaville and there's a large movie complex as well.   http://www.universalorlando.com    Sea World is one of my absolute favorites in all of Orlando. There are many shows with multiple showings and spaced nicely throughout the day including Shamu's show,  a dolphin and acrobat show, the sea lion and otter show, a show featuring pet animals, etc. You can also get involved with feedings and can pet and feed the dolphins and stingrays, feed the sea lions and seals, etc. There are numerous exhibits featuring penguins, sharks, manatees and my favorite the arctic exhibit (which features polar bears, walrus, etc. It would definitely take a full day for this park. Sea World also has the new water park, Aquatica where you can go on water slides literally alongside dolphins and fish (that would also take at least half a day if not a full day). http://www.aquaticabyseaworld.com   Also worth looking into is Discovery Cove at Sea World (which is very popular and needs to be booked FAR in advance). Discovery Cove allows you to actually swim with dolphins and sting rays, snorkel in a coral reef, visit a tropical bird aviary, etc. http://www.discoverycove.com    Busch gardens is in Tampa and is about a 1.5 hour drive away. It is a fun park, but to be honest, I'm not sure that it is worth that much of a drive when you have Animal Kingdom and Universal Islands of Adventure in Orlando (Busch Gardens is kind of a mix of a safari ride and a thrill park). Hope this helped, have fun!|`|tV7ZYIeEaa	Universal Orlando has 2 parks, Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. Both can be done a day each. Sea World is about 10 mins away from Universal can also be done in a day.     Busch Gardens is in Tampa that would take a day and a half to really experience everything it is about an hour and half drive from Orlando if you dont have a car they have shuttles that can take you for I think $10 per person    If you stay at any of the 3 Universal onsite hotels you can get in front (Universal Express) of all the lines for all the rides in both Universal parks.|`|Il0QA1Hcaa	I agree with the other answers Universal one day, Islands of adventure 1 day, Seaworld one day, Aquatica one day, and Bush Gardens 2 days. If you like water parks make sure you visit Aquatica if not a water park person then go ahead and skip it. Right now they are running deals on all the tickets. Seaworld, Aquatica, and Bush Gardens for 125 7 day pass and Universal, Islands of Adventure 2 park hopper 7 day pass 100. I am not sure if you can buy the tickets now and use them in 2010, but I am sure if you give them a call they will let you know. I know they expire 7 days after the first use|`|q9NPU952aa	You can do each of the Universal Parks and Sea World in one day (each).  So, that is three days right there.  Keep in mind that Sea World also has other parks (Discovery Cove, Aquatica).  You would want a full day at each of these, too.    Busch Gardens is also a one-day park, but you will have some travel time as that is in Tampa, not Orlando.    Have a great trip!

AA11672256	There are countless Indian titles (rather surnames to be exact). So it is not possible to give an exact figure.  Bishts belong to the Hindu religion.  Bisht refers to the title of Rajputs in Kumaon and Garhwal regions of Uttarakhand. Bisht was a title given by Kumaon and Garhwal Kings to nobles. It has come from the word Visishist, a Sanskrit word that means distinguished. Bishts are also in Himachal Pradesh.  Bisht in Uttarakhand are - Rawal, Parihaar, Panwar etc. Usually the families know their ancestory and they mention from which larger family they come from like Parihaar Bisht or Rawal Bisht etc. is mentioned.  Bisht title became synonymous with nobility and elitism and this led to its use by non Rajputs.  Some of the Bisht's known in Uttrakhand are Brahmins as well. A variation of "Bisht" last name is "Bist". These are mostly Kumaoni Rajputs.  Bisht originated as an occupational title. It was given to nobles who were courtiers to the kings. They possesed grants of lands (Jagirs) from the kings and in turn collected taxes from the tillers. This practice continued over centuries and was abolished by the British when they enforced land reforms in the hills and as a result the land ownership went to the tiller.  Mostly Rajputs possessed this title and passed this to their generations. Being a title of status it became preferable in use, however many families still remember their original surnames.

cCvA9kMiaa	Taxi fare is not pricey comparing with London. To let you know how it works, the way they charge you is like this :  1. In the city centre, when you broad a taxi, the amount in the taxi meter will be HK$18 for the first 2 kilometres, then after that every 200 metres' journey the meter will charge HK$1.5, after 9 kilometres it will be cheaper, by then every 200 metres' journey you will only be charged HK$1. Waiting time is HK$1.4 per minute.    2. In the Lantau Island ( where the airport located ) the first 2 km is HK$13, every 200 metres is HK$1.3 and after 20 km it drops to HK$1.2, waiting time is HK$1.2 per minutes.    3. In the New Territories, the first 2 km is HK$13.5, every 200 metres they charge you HK$1.2 and waiting time is HK$1.2 per minutes.    So what does this mean ? It means this system will benefit those who hire the taxi for a long journey.     As for the choice of hotels, the Newton is the cheapest. Double room is HK$1,100-1,200 per night ( roughly 100 at today's rate ). It's situated in Mongkok, Kowloon which is the city centre. So taking a taxi from there will mean to pay the first list price from above.    Sky City Hotel is from Marriott group which is a five star hotel and is located in the airport area. Rooms are more pricey. A double will cost you around HK$2,600 (250) per night. It's location is in the Lantau Island so you will pay the fare of the second price list from above.     Gold Coast is also a five star hotel located in Castle Peak Road, Kowloon. If you stay there you will pay the fare of a city taxe, that is , the first price list from above.    Now the choice is yours. It really depends on your budget or your interest. Would you like to stay in the city, getting closer to all shopping centres or entertainment ? Or would you rather stay in the Lantau Island but travel to the city or the tourist attractions ?|`|ZtPdNnIZaa	taxi is not expensive in HK at all. but just the airport is pretty far fr the city. that's y people tot taxi is expensive as if u r travelling out to the city. it's cost u min.

JEb2Kqd4aa	it`s a good sign tho.|`|2kgTdNRQaa	The term "third world" has been dropped in favor of "developing" countries, by the international economists and media.

IMHO.|`|I07MtJzAaa	It should be. almost half of the population suffers from poverty.|`|7BAjFHqraa	I think that the Philippines should not be categorized as a Third World Country but "Third World" is a categorical label used to describe states that are considered to be underdeveloped in terms of their economy or level of industrialization, globalization, standard of living, health, education or other criteria for 'advancements'.

But I don't understand the question really, "... Philippines is one of the third world countries. isn't it should be in the list?" .  Can the Asker deliver the question clearly?

AA12077917	I live in the Almaden Valley section of San Jose.  Its on the south end of San Jose up against the foothills.  There are bike trails, and hiking trails all within walking or biking distance from the neighborhoods.  Almaden Quicksilver Park is full of trails for biking and hiking. Excellent schools in the area help keep home values stable.  Home values range from 700K to over 1 million in the valley while nice homes up in the hills are 2 to 3 million.  Go to www.zillow.com and search for zip code 95120 to see home values for the whole area.   See link below for photos of the Almaden area.  Another nice area in San Jose is called Evergreen (zip code 95121).    Right next to San Jose and partially up in the mountains is the city of Los Gatos.  Its very nice but expensive.

As you move closer to San Jose into Morgan Hill and Gilroy, the prices start going up, and open land is less common.

SLFt8eHEaa	I'm afraid Zed is right.  I'm not sure how expensive it is to live in Swansea these days, but you will not be able to live anywhere in London or the surrounding counties on 15,000 a year.  By the time you've taken into account rent, transport costs, council tax, bills, food, etc. you need a good 25,000 not to get into debt, and even then you can't live a particularly lavish lifestyle (I earn more than that and haven't been out for 2 weeks because I'm broke!).  To be completely honest, I really wouldn't move down here on a wage like that.  I really don't want to sound harsh but it will be nigh on impossible.  You certainly won't have the luxury of picking an area that's safe for a woman.  If you're dead set on moving the only thing I can think of is looking at hostels as they will be cheaper and you won't have the additional bills et al to pay.  I know they're not a great place to call home but I really can't see any alternative on that sort of money.|`|a1058b5dd12e136a37cb2cef8a6a1b17aa	Where do you live now? I'm from America (Chicago) and am living in London now. Compared to Chicago, everywhere in London is safe!    I'd suggest West London though - Earl's Court or Ealing are pretty economical. Try checking www.gumtree.com. That's where I found my flat.  Good luck and enjoy!|`|HUlyRTrraa	HA!    Nowhere on that salary.    Sorry but unless you are flat sharing you can not afford to live & work in London on that.     I live inside zone 1, London and earn over twice that amount and it's a stretch.     You would be better off looking at places around Brentford maybe, but then your money will be eaten up by fares.    That's not enough money to go it alone in London.    On a more positive note, London is pretty safe considering the volume of people and that it is all under CCTV. You will be captured 300 times a day by Big Brother.      Edit. Dagenham will cost you 10 a day in travel ! That is the other side of London in Essex.  Middlesex is closest. Brentford, Chiswick... but it's not cheap.
NzHtbpfJaa	Anywhere in the Northern Beaches area in my opinion.  So Smithfield, Trinity Beach, Kewarra Beach, Clifton Beach and Palm Cove (although Palm cove would be the most expensive to rent and is the most touristy place)     Buses run all through these places every 30 mins week days and hourly on weekends - buses go into the city via the Uni at Smithfield so a car is not necessary really, but good if you want your freedom a bit more.  Car registration is expensive in Qld however, you are looking at an average of $500-$650 a year, depending on what type of vehicle it is.  (you can pay every 6 months which will half the bill)

2HETgiwgaa	There are summer schools (New Zealand summer that is) at most of our universities - aimed at new and existing students - so, you might find something of interest to you amongst their offerings.  Most of the links have information for the 08-09 summer, and don't have info for the 09-10 summer yet - but it'll give you somewhere to start.<br>  <br>  I went to Otago, but the summer school is a relatively new (last 10 yrs or so) development so I'm not personally familiar with it.  Happy to recommend the quality of the teaching and resources at Otago, though.<br>  <br>  The other universities all have good reputations, so you should probably just go with the one that's offering what you're most interested in.<br>  <br>  Edit:  We do use the term "freshmen" - first year students at Otago are called freshers, and the bugs that go around the halls of residence at the beginning of the year are known as "fresher-flu" - Though, it's not a common term outside of university circles.<br>  <br>  Additional: In that case - if you're looking for something to do in your summer (our winter) - you might be able to come over and go to a high school here for a few months (or longer) - have you thought about AFS or something similar?|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	Bear in mind your summer is our winter though......So our summer programmes aren't run to coincide with your college holidays.....<br>  <br>  Also we don't use terminology here for University (college) students like freshmen.

Near the end of the cruise, they have a formal dance and you have to dress to impress.<br>  <br>  There are many oppritunities to meet people on board....just dont be shy and go to the club 02 the first day you get on the cruise. <br>  <br>  I dont really know anything about the shore excurrsions because I when I got to the islands, I went off with my family and took a cab to the beaches and shops. I reccomend not planning excurrsions with the cruise at the desk on board because they are not as fun and they are way more pricy. Just get a cab for the day and go anywere you want to.

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Universal's fun for one day.<br>  <br>  My sincere advice is to rent a car. The weekly price of a car will be much less than a round trip taxi ride to Santa Monica Pier.<br>  <br>  It's going to be HOT in July. Be prepared with plenty of water on your ride to Burbank.<br>  <br>  As for other things:<br>  <br>  There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of “must sees”. Visit as many as you have time for.:<br>  <br>  Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors can’t be wrong. #1 Destination in SoCal.<br>  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour. #2 Destination<br>  Even if you don’t visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And they’re free to visit. <br>  <br>  Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theater and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors. <br>  <br>  Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.<br>  <br>  Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings. <br>  <br>  Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.<br>  <br>  Queen Mary: Once the largest ship afloat, she's been docked in Long Beach for longer than she sailed, and her elegance never fails to impress. Free to visit. You can actually stay on board, for a price.<br>  <br>  Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.<br>  <br>  TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go. <br>  <br>  Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.<br>  <br>  Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.<br>  <br>  Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.<br>  <br>  Places to eat:<br>  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.<br>  Pink’s Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.<br>  Tommy’s Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.<br>  Canter’s Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.<br>  Phillippe’s: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, it’s hot.<br>  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.<br>  <br>  Places to Stay:<br>  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.<br>  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame. <br>  In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.<br>  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn.<br>  <br>  Places to Shop:<br>  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica<br>  The Grove, Los Angeles<br>  Americana @ Brand, Glendale<br>  Beverly Center, Los Angeles<br>  Citadel Outlets, Commerce<br>  Brea Mall, Brea<br>  The Block at Orange, Orange<br>  South Coas|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	That's really up to you whether Universal Studios is fun.
AA11280367	Yes, Fiji's "summer" from November to April is the hurricane (cyclone) season with two or three such storms to be expected each year. Basically, it's just a matter of luck if you'll be affected. The high rains and winds associated with hurricanes only last a few days and are usually followed by calm, clear weather. Sitting through a hurricane can be a memorable experience! That said, it would be unwise to schedule an international departure for the same day you'll be returning from an outer island at this time of year. If there's a hurricane warning, all boats and flights will be canceled and you may not find out until it's too late. Visit the outer islands at the start of your trip and allow a few days around Nadi toward the end so you won't miss your flight.|`|gMgh2ypsaa	Cyclones <br>  <br>  The cyclone season in Fiji is from November to April, about the same as Australias|`|cgl2IOECaa	2 Free points !

71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	As a transplanted New Yorker who has live in SD for many years I can provide some insight. New York is a teaming mass of humanity and as a matter of survival you are brought up anti-social. You never make eye contact with anyone on the subway because some psycho nutcase might take it the wrong way and you'll end up dead. Also, New Yorkers are busy. They just want to get where they're going and find the presence of so many people pretty annoying. When I return for a visit I literally have to put my game face on.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine, who is a California native, recounted this story to me about his first visit to New York and it pretty much sums up the difference. He bought a paper at a newsstand, paid the cashier and put out his hand for the change. The cashier slapped the change down on the counter. "Why?" he asked. The answer is because he deals with thousands of people daily and he doesn't to want to make physical contact with someones germ infested hand. In NY you never know where that hand has been.<br>  <br>  As the song goes "New York got the ways and means but just won't let you be. Oh no."|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	I went to NY. The people were very nice from the woman at the museum who gave me a free pass to the guy who wanted to know if I needed directions. Personally as far as I can see the whole "rude New Yorkers" thing is just stereotyping.|`|AA11540917	not true<br>  I like all the New Yorkers I have ever met ( maybe not warm but always friendly )<br>  and I am a native of Southern California (born in Hollywood)|`|AA11103012	It is not the case.  I've lived in California and I've lived in New York and visit New York City frequently.  It's a culture thing.  California is generally warm and spacious and New York City is cool and crowded.  For example, in California on the bus, people spread their newspapers out fully, or tend too, whereas in New York, this is impolite, and people fold their newpapers up into quarters, so as to take up less room.  In New York, it is inconsiderate to take up people's time and space, and this tends to give the Californians the impressions that New Yorkers are "cold and hostile" when actually Californians acting like Californians in New York are being rude and inconvenient.
517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Not offense exactly, but disappointed or hurt, because I don't think that the lack was meant to be a personal slight.

In return, they also give you something, but it might be at some times much later. It is their way of saying thank you. I hope though that my gifts are appreciated. So I choose carefully, and then give for the sake of giving and from my heart. And I give to those who merited my attention and respect for some reason or other. No thanks required - a gift is sometimes my way of saying thanks in the first place!|`|NgMuF2j2aa	yeah Bean's right..i've i give a smack on someone face,  i shouldn't hope that he or she say thank to me and appreciated it LOL~|`|36ba002aec92f71b922ff7413175c9f4aa	Yep.

7Y2jmO7Taa	You sure you want brutally honest???<br>  <br>  Okay, here goes:<br>  <br>  Stony Brook is the best college in the NY State college system, and that's great for people who live in NY and want to go to a state school because it's cheaper. But it's not all that impressive. NYU is certainly much more highly thought of.<br>  <br>  As to the idea that it's close to NYC - well...it is...but......<br>  <br>  You should know that NYC is not like L.A. There really is a firm line in the minds of New Yorkers about what IS NYC and what ISN'T NYC. Long Island doesn't count. You will NOT feel like you live really near NYC in Stony Brook, Long Island. <br>  <br>  If you really want the NYC experience, you are talking NYU or Columbia, if you can get in to either of them. Or Fordham or St. Johns, which are easier to get into. Or one of the schools in the NYC public university system, which is called CUNY. The 4 year CUNY colleges are: Hunter, CCNY, Queens College, and Brooklyn College.<br>  <br>  Another private school that's easier to get into, is Long Island University, which has a campus in Brooklyn. (Brooklyn IS in NYC.)<br>  <br>  Good luck, and you should try to come and visit Stony Brook. You'll get a far better idea of whether or not it is for you.|`|d3YToW4Aaa	HELL YEAH!!!i was born there so of course its the creme de la creme.also my sister is a nurse in riverhead and she said stony brook university is the best on the island.and the hospital is also the best to because every time there's a big problem they take the people to SB|`|2EVoNHHbaa	I'll give you my thoughts.  Others may disagree.<br>  <br>  Stony Brook is part of the State University of New York--a large system of colleges across the state.  It's one of the four major university centers, and has a strong academic reputation.  The reason for the low tuition is that it's state supported.  Even as an out-of-state student you'll still get a good deal.<br>  <br>  By the way, where did you post your original question?  I look pretty carefully at questions in the New York City topic and don't recall seeing it. <br>  <br>  Figure though that, at least on the undergraduate level most of your classmates will be from New York State.  As a person from California you'll be a bit of an odd-ball.  On the graduate level that would be different, since their graduate programs attract folks from across the country.<br>  <br>  Is it as good as NYU?  It depends on the program, but the general answer is probably not.  Is it as good as Fordham?  I'd say yes.  Is it one of the best colleges in the U.S.?  Overall probably not, although some of its programs may be.  <br>  <br>  By the way, Stony Brook isn't all that close to New York City--it's a several hour drive or train trip.  You can definitely get into the city on weekends, but it's not something you'll be doing every couple of days.  Stony Brook is WAY out on Long Island--look at a map.<br>  <br>  As for people ignoring your questions--I see you've already received several good responses within a few hours of posting it.  At least in this topic (New York City) people tend to get good answers pretty quickly.  There's no need to say things like "Answer or Die".|`|i9BjHDHOaa	hey <br>  <br>  no one was answering my question either, but you you put it under another catagorie more people answer ;)<br>  <br>  i'm not sure about Stony Brook, because i live in England and i have never been to New York<br>  <br>  I honestly think it would be ace to talk about it, and if they dont like it then scr*w them. because Stony Brook is a part of who you are<br>  <br>  Email me :)<br>  <br>  i hope i helped<br>  <br>  x|`|fbd64694a498c73d8b0c3ca90c37602aaa	Well it ranked in the top 100.  Did that include all colleges and universities in the USA?  I, personally, have never heard of it, but that makes it one of thousands.  You obviously thought it was a good college.  You may now feel you undershot your abilities, but you can still be the best you can.  As for what employers think of the school, I would hope that they are more interested in what courses you took, how you did in them and how you are able to present yourself and employ the skills you learned.|`|AA12027560	Now I know why you were ignored & you did not get your question answered and it's no other than the way you ask the people.<br>  Stony brook is really good hospital.|`|41ERg1Gvaa	No, it wouldn't impress the typical job interviewer very much to say that you went to Stony Brook.<br>  That's not the only important consideration in choosing a college. It sounds like you could really stand to attend a college that will help you master social skills and attain maturity -- "answer or die"? C'mon.

uKWcgLLoaa	Dave is completely FULL OF IT!    I've been here all my life, too. I suspect Dave has an attitude problem, because making friends in Seattle is about as easy as it gets in a big city. Seattle is known for it's relaxed and friendly welcome toward "outsiders" and newcomers.    Although some of Dave's opinion about certain parts of town are correct, I think he missed a lot of opportunity to tell you about where you WILL be safe and comfortable. You may want to choose to locate east of Lake Washington (Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland area where there are lots of newer construction homes in nice suburban neighborhoods), although that will require a drive in traffic during rush hour over one of two bridges that tend to get a bit congested. If you prefer to stay in town, you could always live somewhere like Madison Park (on the west shore of Lake Washington, but requiring a drive through a "bad" part of town on your way to work), or in a north end community like Shoreline (near the northwest corner of Lake Washington--nice middle class community with about a 20-30 minute drive to downtown Seattle) or in a closer-in neighborhood like Green Lake, Pinehurst, Northgate, Lake City (all north and northeast of downtown, but only 15-25 minues away) or Ballard, Carkeek Park, or Richmond Highlands (all northwest of downtown, and about a 15-25 minute drive to downtown).    If you want to live VERY CLOSE to the Seattle Center and downtown, there is always Queen Anne Hill which has some very nice, quiet neighborhoods and stately old houses.    Dave's cynicism is clearly based on personal issues. Seattle has often been pegged the "most livable" big city in the US by studies and surveys that track that sort of thing. Welcome!|`|AA11375099	I hope you already have your favorite sport teams because the ones here suck!  Traffic sucks, so live close to your job.      It is very hard to meet people here, so bring your own friends, don't expect people to be as friendly here.  If you bike, beware because drivers tend to steer their cars towards you.    The university district is full of homeless and crime.  Recently students have been robbed at gunpoint on busy streets.    Don't live in Bell town, the noise from the nightclubs would keep you up all night.    Broadway is a mess, same as bell town only they consume more booze  there so it is worse than Belltown.    Stay away from Pioneer Square that is where the sport stadiums are located...if you want to hear screaming all night long then it would not matter too much.    China Town is where a lot of homeless are, avoid that.      Don't live north of town traffic could be terrible and you could spend half your life going to and from work.  Especially North of 145th street.    Don't live east of the city, you would then have to take a bridge to work if you work in Seattle.  They will be making all the bridges toll bridges soon.    If you live on Beacon Hill, it is becoming affordable and that means more gangs will be moving there next.    South Park, better wear red or blue depending on which part of it you will be staying.    So, have fun, bring an umbrella.  If cost of living is NO CONCERN, then I would choose:    One of then new apartments around Lake Union (Paul Allen's new development).  Some even have a grocery store connected to them with an elevator from your apartment stopping on the floor of the 24 hours store.    It is also located by REI, so you can buy all your gortex gear there.    You better come with a girl or boy friend because they are hard to get here.  We are known to be hard to meet.|`|AA11397003	it is not cheap !|`|tBSChaT9aa	Yeah rethink your plan|`|JOoqy9doaa	Seattle is generally a nice place to live, people are nice blah  Blah blah. Dave is right about the neighborhoods he mentioned, but he did leave out the good ones that were mentioned below. Just don't ride your bike or I might have to run you over. Everyone bikes here.|`|MxhJjSgLaa	Seattle is awesome, 85% of the people are friendly and will help you if they can. rain alot during September through may or june. lots of rain. but lost of everything els too. live near your job. get out at night, the city always has people out and about.|`|yMQicnjmaa	The hookers are great.
XagPxe7Faa	I would try checking with shelters or breed specific rescues, especially if your funds are limited.  Contact your local ASPCA for refereces to rescues.  Breeding ethically is not a cheap venture when you consider all the costs involved, so you would be hard pressed to find a "cheap" dog from a reputable breeder.  But there are Yorkies still in need of a good home that would be willing to return the love you have to offer with their own.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Most breeds have rescue societies.  You could google yorkie rescue New York (or New Jersey) and see if you get anything.|`|1cJjGNOBaa	many humane societies will allow you to put your name on a list for a certain breed of dog, should one come in. I would try that.... I've seen yorkies in the pound before, poor things. Good Luck
AA10240904	Hoover Dam and Lake Mead are very nice though the water level is way down.

Its nice to get out of town for a while, and clear your head. You can rent Jet Skis or boats on the lake and its very peaceful. There are little beach inlets to pull off at and relax.|`|AA12261142	strip clubs are fun|`|ESSougVVaa	Although gambling is the largest part of Vegas, over the past two decades the city has been trying to make the city more "family friendly" with a lot of shows and even amusement parks. There is an M%M store where there are M%Ms EVERYWHERE in every color you could possibly imagine.|`|ee84f878d59734da208adb9eb82587a9aa	I spend more time shooting photos than anything else. The massive architecture and neon lights of Las Vegas Blvd. offer thousands of photo opportunities. You can easily spend the entire day shooting photos, then after it gets dark you do it all over again and each shot looks entirely different.|`|siQjKX0laa	Rent a boat for half-day, great way to put in the time and unwind.|`|zAFS4yWMaa	There are many wonderful and interesting places in Las Vegas where you can go & visit with your husband, such as, inexpensive funny comedy Magic show by Mac King at Harrahs to many free shows like The Aquarium at the Silverton to Bellagio's Botanical Garden or you can visit the World's largest and finest classic car showroom 125,000 sq. feet The Auto Collection at Imperial Palace. There are many large shopping malls like Las Vegas Outlet Center to Galleria at Sunset. I usually visit this informative website: <a href="http://www.going-lasvegas.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.going-lasvegas.com/</a> to get most of my information on where to go and shop in Las Vegas. Good Luck and have a great time with your husband in Las Vegas|`|AA12105863	Red Rock is pretty awesome to drive through and if you like to climb there are parts out there to do that I think.  <br>  <br>  You can also take a 45 minute drive up to the mt. charleston lodge where it will probably be snowing and have a meal and hot cocoa up there. <br>  <br>  There are plenty of things to do if you just walk up and down the strip, which will normally take a day or two.<br>  <br>  I would definately reccomend the fremont street experience.  Its where Binions casino is (the one where they hold the world series of poker).  and they have a lot of shops and fun events going on all the time.|`|JrVcss4zaa	On our last trip we visited Lake Mead, the Hoover Dam and The Grand Canyon. We made a pit stop on Route 66 in AZ on the way to the Grand Canyon, we had lunch at the famous Roadkill cafe!! That was all in one day, so we didn't do much at the first two, just looked around and took pictures!<br>  <br>  Then back over in vegas other than seeing all the main Casino "attractions" we took a quick trip to the Valley of Fire, very beautiful place! Hope this helps, have a great time on your trip!
f5UmSdoMaa	Linkin Park are probably not going to schedule a lot of shows this year because they're in their homes in LA writing music for their next CD. They next time they tour in the states is dependent on how quickly finish the next CD. <br>  <br>  They taking a break from writing this summer to go to Europe for the Sonisphere festival, but they don't have anything else on their agenda right now. Something similar happened in 2006 when the only shows LP played while writing Minutes to Midnight was the Sonic Festival in Japan. I think this year will be similar to 2006 and only have one small set of shows.|`|JrVcss4zaa	It doesnt look like they have any dates in Cali scheduled at this time:(! I'm sure it wont be too long before they head back to their home state!|`|vxpotYkWaa	I only like one song from them.<br>  The rest are ****.<br>  <br>  <br>  Not THE ****, just ****.<br>  As in crap.
2EVoNHHbaa	It was the estate of Robert E. Lee and his family.  His home--Arlington House--still stands at a high point of the cemetery and is open for tours.  The federal government seized the property from him during the Civil War (while he was busy fighting on the side of the Confederacy) and began using it as a cemetery, to ensure that the Lee's would never go back--which they didn't.  Well after the war, his family fought a long lawsuit battle and finally was compensated by the federal government for the seizure of his estate.  Robert E. Lee isn't buried there--he was buried in the western part of Virginia, at the university he ran after the war was over, which is now called Washington & Lee University.|`|AA10216571	It was the estate of Gen. Robert E. Lee|`|XaRBewgXaa	a field of grass|`|xo2xyl78aa	It was Lee's wife's family home.  Arlington House  (Custis-Lee Mansion) still stands on the property and has a great view of DC.  The property came from Lee's wife (Mary Anna Custis Lee and linked to Martha Washington) family, and Lee himself never owned the home.  After Lee's father-in-law died, Lee's wife was allowed to live in the home and have control over it until her death.  Then, the house would be passed to her eldest son.  Lee lived there off and on. It was a very large farm.  It did fall into financial trouble shortly before Lee's father-in-law died.  Lee was able to bring it back to profitably for a while, but then the war broke.   <br>  <br>  During the war, there was problems with the taxes and keeping up the house.  Mrs. Lee couldn't pay the taxes, so the house went up for public sale in 1864.  The government purchased the property.  Shortly after wards, it was made a cemetery so the Lee's could never try to return to their home.  Graves were intentionally put near the house first.  There was also a small village for freed-slaves to live and farm during the war.  <br>  <br>  Years later, Mrs Lee's son sued the federal government saying that he was the rightful owner of the property and that the government illegally seized it. The courts ruled in his favor, and gave the property back to the government. A few months later, the government purchased it for $150,000.
oXRZfAWaaa	It's not a question they will ask (thus calling it a "test"); it's the sense an interviewer gets from you over the course of the entire interview.  Forget the words: what they're really trying to measure, and saying in a polite way here is: Can I stand spending time with this person?
kjB4jLcxaa	Inproceesing is done in Yongsan, for Area 2 and 1 bases.  You could be assigned anywhere from Yongsan, K16, CRC, Camp Stanley, Camp Casey among a few.  List your MOS and I could give you a more accurate conclusion of where you could go.<br>  <br>  If you are an E1-E3 you will not be able to command sponsor your wife.  However if she came to Korea to visit, she would be able to have access to any base you are at, as long as she has a military form of ID, or if not you can get her a base pass.<br>  <br>  edit- I was stationed in Casey for 3 years.  I got married to a Korean during the last 2 years that I was in.  I was an E4 at that time, however I couldn't live off post with my wife until I was an E5.  When I hit E5 I was getting out 4 months after that.  So I never even tried.  I think there's an age requirement as well.  I got married when I was 20, and I was an E5 when I was 22.  At that time the commander said it was all good to live off post, but before I was an E5 he was against it.  I really don't reccomend her coming here un-sponsered.  The cost of living is seriously expensive.  Your best bet is to get into contact with your current commander and see if there's anything that's possible, go through the channels first.  If you've got kids, you'll have a better chance, especially if your stationed in Area 2.  Area 1 though, (Uijeongbu, Dongducheon, Paju) it's not possible either way if you are not an NCO.
0UVqBCNdaa	With two warrants out, they might look at this as evading.  And at first glance, that is what it looks like.  So, if you're serious about this, I'd get those taken care of first.      And they look at everything.  At least Royal Caribbean did for me.  Luckily mine was clean.    They want people who are trustworthy.  If you can't follow the rules on land, and obey the law, whose to say you can be trusted on a ship?  And the failure to appear or pay the fines goes along way in determining your character.  So while it might not have been a big deal to you, it very well may be to them.    A speeding ticket or two...not a big deal  A couple warrants for failure to appear....big deal (not sarcasm)|`|94b8KImYaa	To answer your first question. If you look for the employment section on the cruise lines website you will find them.     Here is for example the one for Carnival Cruises:   http://www.carnival.com/cms/fun/fun_jobs...    You will not find one online application site for different cruise lines. you need to go to each cruise lines website and look for the employment section (mostly on the bottom of the site)     As for background checks - each employer has their own things they look for, so you could pass at one and not at another.   But with 2 warrants out - you might not even get into the port, where the ship is sailing from.....maybe it would be better to clear those things up first.|`|iVUh6dRJaa	Check this out:  http://www.mycruiseshipjob.com/members/c...  http://www.workoncruiseships.com/    Good Luck

AA10042296	If you're going to just hang around the beach, pool, bar and hotel restaurant, you may want to go to Nuevo Vallarta.  If you feel like you might get out to go to different bars and restaurants, then Puerto Vallarta would be better.  Puerto Vallarta is south of the airport and Nuevo Vallarta is north of the airport.Click the first link to read reviews of 20 Nuevo Vallarta hotels and click the second link to read reviews of 117 Puerto Vallarta hotels.  In either place, if you want to take a tour (like the zip line jungle canopy tour), your hotel can arrange for someone to come pick you up.  Most of Puerto Vallarta is very walkable (like the malecon and the little island in the Rio Cuale), but if you out in Nuevo Vallarta, you've just got hotels.  So click around the links below (hotel photos; things to do, etc.) and see what you think.|`|siHN027laa	rhino is right so I won't belabor the point......  Buses constantly run and until late at night and last time I was there it was around seven and half pesos for the bus ride (About 51 cents).  Taxis are all over but get a map of PV first so they don't run you all over town and be sure to fix the price before leaving........

OxwWclcmaa	Driving in Ireland is find and definitely the best way to travel- you don't want to rely too much on public transport!     I think you could plan a great honeymoon here. The west of Ireland especially Connemara is very romantic and the west in general has an amazing cultural and historical background with lots of castles etc. Galway is my favourite city and places like the Burren in Clare are like nothing you've ever seen.     Cork and Kerry in the south are also well worth the visit if a little touristy. Dublin for many is a must see with lots to do there.    If I were to choose between two counties Galway and Clare are beside each other and the best.  There are lots of castles to choose from. Some of the most famous to stay in in the west are Dromoland Castle (www.dromoland.ie/), the Glenlo Abbey Hotel and Gregan's Castle Hotel.   However these ate quite expensive and as I said there are loads of examples! Try this website http://www.ireland-guide.com/|`|Uo7Gn26iaa	My husband and I rented a car in Dublin and proceeded to drive through many counties (we hit all of the major coastlines (didn't go to Northern Ireland, though) in 2007..this was an amazing trip! The driving does take some getting used to but isn't as scary as you might think. We stayed at a bed and breakfast that was attached to an old castle (look up Killiane Castle (Drinagh, Co. Wexford)..Also in Co. Wexford is Tintern Abbey (google it)..it was Amazing to see! Co. Kerry is gorgeous as are the Aran Islands and Co. Galway. Have a great time!
g05wGcPhaa	Miami has a number of good and bad cities to live in and to avoid.     In Miami the cities are divided into numerous area's. Places to avoid in Miami are Liberty City, Overtown, North Miami, Opa Locka, Atlantic City, Carol City, Little Haiti, or anything around Opa Locka Airport. Good places to live in are some parts of Homestead, Coconut Grove, Key Biscayne, Coral Gables, South Miami, and Midtown. Most of these places are expensive like crazy.    Do you have a job to support your needs if you come here? Because as of right now it's nearly impossible to find a job especially in Miami Dade County. The unemployment rate right now in South Florida has reached 8.1% since December 08 , higher than the national unemployment rate of 7.2%. So that means 752,000 are jobless right now. In the tri-county area, Palm Beach County had the highest unemployment rate, with 7.8 percent, followed by Miami-Dade, with 7 percent, and Broward, with 6.8 percent. Most companies are cutting jobs right now so it's going to be quite hard for you to find a job because now you have to compete with a whole bunch of people who probably want the same position.    I suggest you come here first check things out and decide weather its right for your you or not.|`|A7cWzCmpaa	check out the university of miami it is great and in a wonderful area|`|fl8JUJspaa	Depends where you settle in miami i went to visit for 3 days from New York and it was expensive from me maybe because i stayed in South beach but anywhere in America is good to study and go to school. Just make good friends which is important and after that you will know how to get around the area.

Come here y you will studys.|`|3BjWyHzKaa	Miami is great place to live and go to school.  There are many different cultures, there are plenty of things to do, and there are nice colleges in the area.  Since you are from Spain (and bilingual), you will be able to immerse yourself in many things the city has to offer.     As long as you have good study habits, you will do fine in school.  You have the motivation to move to another country to attend school, so I would assume that you are highly motivated to do well.    I suggest living on campus for the first year or two while you get yourself oriented to the area.  The schools have programs in place for international students in order to make the transition easy as possible.  The University of Miami (a private school) is located in Coral Gables, FL and is in an extremely nice area, and Florida International University (a public school) is located in Miami in a good area.      Do some research and check out the schools.  Ask if you can get the names of former students that live in your area.  Many schools have "ambassadors" that reach out to prospective students in their area.  That way, you can talk to someone face-to-face about their experiences and if you will fit into that school's dynamic.
