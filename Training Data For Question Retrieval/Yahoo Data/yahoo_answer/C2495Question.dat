The Serving Maids Holiday (15th century)      All day i have tried,   I have not wound spindle or reel;   To great bliss i am brought        on this high holiday.      I cannot weave nor wind nor spin,    For joy that it is a holiday.      All unswept is our floor,   And our fire is unlit,   Our rushes are still uncut,       on this high holiday.      I cannot weave nor wind nor spin,    For joy that it is a holiday.      I must go and bring herbs in;   Thread my kerchief under my chin;   Dear jack, lend me a pin       to thread me this holiday.      I cannot weave nor wind nor spin,    For joy that it is a holiday.      Now it draws near to noon   And all my chores are undone;   I must clean my shoes a little       to make them soft on this holiday.      I cannot weave nor wind nor spin,    For joy that it is a holiday.      I must milk in this pail;   I should have cooked this whole dish,   The dough is still under my nails        as i knead on this holiday.      I cannot weave nor wind nor spin,    For joy that it is a holiday.      Jack will entice me on my way,   Desire to enjoy himself with me;   I am not even afraid of my dame       on a good holiday.      I cannot weave nor wind nor spin,    For joy that it is a holiday.      any1 any ideas?

Trees Have To Shave Their Beards      Maple trees sit atop blackened chairs    As the wind carefully shaves their chins,   They leave no stubble   Nor do they cut or bruise   A clean shave,   And that is how it is supposed to be   Mother Earth puts on her little black dress   The moon blushes in excitement   Cheeks glowing white amid lamps of desire   The stars gaze with longing at her presence   Drooling twinkling reflections into warm waters   That surrounds the forest like a mote   Maple trees sweep Her off her feet,   As Her smile lights up the horizon   And the tiny whisper of the wind   Closing its shop for the night      Note from the poet: I personally enjoyed writing this poem. I tried to personify the trees in a way as if they were actually at the barbershop and getting a shave for their big date with mother earth!! lol.

Upon searching wikipedia, i have found out that "Barbie's full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts".  "Barbie is a fashion doll manufactured by Mattel, Inc. and launched in March 1959"   "Klaus Barbie (October 25, 1913 – September 25, 1991) was an SS-Hauptsturmführer (rank approximately equivalent to army captain), soldier and Gestapo member. He was known as the Butcher of Lyon."   "On July 4, 1987, Klaus Barbie was sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity, and died in jail in Lyon of leukemia four years later, at the age of 77."      Question, for those who lived or know what it was like back then.. when you have such a war criminal as Klaus Barbie, is it ok to invent a doll named after(or at least bearing the identical family name of) that person? People must have knows about him, it was all in the papers. Was it like a mockery? although, if you invent right now dolls named Saddam, not most children would even touch them.. I really don't get the name, how come they are so popular, with such a controversial name? thank you.

Either, let the reader know who the criminal is right from the start, and see what the other characters are doing to find them, and what they are doing wrong... or, let the reader find out the clues and details as the characters find them. I personally like the second way better, but I'm thinking about getting it published, and I would like to know what other readers think.

OMG, this is a private dance school so theres no such thing as being suspended and so you can only be expelled so i was begging her to not tell my mom or expell me, so the teacher told me that i had two choices: either i would get expelled (and mom finds out) or i would have to get "taught a lesson" but my teacher wouldnt tell my mom about this. so that i could participate in dance next time and not be in trouble! i chose to get the lesson taught because if i got expelled my mom would be paying for nothing and then id get grounded for like months and probably taught a lesson by her too! omg, what's going to happen to me? do i deserve this? will she make me take the lesson in my panties so i learn it better, or whatever? will the loser girl be there?? omg help!! dance ends in a bit over an hour and fifteen minutes, and right now im on a friends laptop in the changing room. she she lives right next to the studio and showed the class this dance video that she made with her old dance school. anyway, please help, omg!!!!!!!!!!1

20090226132711AAMo0ta	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	More added to 'afraid of home story' please read!!?	Afraid of home            Chapter 1   Home       When I walked out into the night, the dark sky surrounded me like the darkness of a movie theatre and the air was fresh and cool, a slight breeze flung my hair in front of my face, I slowly brushed the hair back into place, I was lost in thought, and no matter how hard I tried I couldn't stop thinking about my best friend and my violent mom. I should be over that feeling by now though, my step-mom has been like this for 5 years and will never stop.    I can tell you only little of my life, because yet, I’m only on the 15th chapter. It all started going bad when my dad died, my step-mom got depressed, never got over it, and took it out on me. Oh by the way I’m Abigail, but you can call me Abby. So where was I? Oh yeah, my step-mom ever since then she takes it out on me, but she just has to love my little sister Amy. Amy doesn’t seem to care, but its bad influence on her, I mean I don’t want her beating up her kids my step-mom Callie.   As I walk home in the cold snowy night, I thought I would call Josh, My best friend since like forever! We’ll just keep this secret to you and me…I have a major crush on him! Shhhh don’t tell him! We talked all the way home, I finally said ‘good bye’   As I walked into the door, Callie waiting just sitting there…   “Abby where the heck have you been!“   “Umm, I was at the movies, by myself, just me, no one else” I said in a scared way that you could probably tell.      Callie stood up…I was just wondering of what she was going to get…oh my gosh, she went to get nothing she came to hit me!   I thought about running, I would just get beaten up more then, so I pretended I was ok and let her do it.  Red bruises and scars, I wish I had Josh, he would protect me.            Chapter 2   Late         In the morning I forgot to set my alarm, waking up at 7:45 I only had 10 minutes to get to school, so I thought I would take my time. Which I did I, got in the shower, washed my body and hair, when I got out, I just stood there, looking at all those bruises. What am I going to blame this on? I already blamed my sister. I got one, I fell down the stairs, not breaking any bones just bruises and scars.   When I finally reached school, I told the attendant I had a doc appt.    I walked down the hall rather slowly to gym, the only class I had with Josh. When I got in I started walking toward josh, tripping! He laughed I laughed, but it was me who got in trouble!   After school finally passes, Josh offered me to go to the movies with him, we where going to go see the most romantic movie ever!   After the movie, Josh and I went to sit on the bench,    ‘Josh I need to tell you something’   ‘Yeah what is it Abby?’   ‘Ok here it goes.. Josh I..umm..have a crush on you’   ‘Oh, Abby I don’t like you’   ‘Oh I understand’   ‘ I love you!’   I reached up to give josh a kiss.   Josh took me home, we kissed for a little bit, then I got out, But before I got out I said ‘ I love you’   He said it back   ‘Good night josh’   “Good night Abby”   I slowly got out of the car…taking it slowly just imagining what Callie would do…   I could feel tears coming out, I felt like balling! I just wanted to run away and scream! I wanted to tell josh so bad, but I didn’t have the nerve, I couldn’t get it out.   ‘You ok Abby?’ Josh asked me in a confused voice   ‘I’m ok.”   ‘Ok good, I love you, good night’   ‘Love you to’   I watched him drive off in to that dark night, he finally disappeared.

20090226135606AAZGwe5	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my story?	ok on my spare time i like to write poems or short stories so im going to put one out here for all to see and judge honest opinions needed!          The beginning of you and me,    So young , So sweet , innocense was in the air due to the summer heat.Findding you sitting on a step. A couple of friends were the reason we had to meet.Nothing came from your lips except a simple ,quiet "Hi." Not paying you any mind , but your looks were more than fine.Sunddenly I wanted to know you alittle better , running to my friends room to check my hair , to grab some make up and gush over you with her ,about the crush I had to get to speak!Didnt care before but something inside screamed that I wanted to see you once more.Days passed since we had met and there you stood at my door for our first date.Was our love doomed from the start?Maybe so because you stole my heart.Thru the summer nights Kisses full of passion , laughs and bushing hugs but we were young so we never made love.My foolish self believed that we were meant to be. I could see it was only you I wanted to share my fears with , and live out my dreams.But a sad November night came so fast and it was so cold when you said you "goodbyes" I didnt even cry .Somehow I knew it wasnt the end of you and me.But as time passes I wonder why my heart hasnt returned from your gasps.Untie the strings , set me free because it is so hard to be without you and I can no longer bare this type of pain.I refrain when people speak of heartach because they know nothing because what we had was pure and it was real love ..I have no regrets , but as the nights play over again in my head kissing you , looking into those icy blue green eyes , seeing you laugh making my day when you smiled . Laying in your warm embrace.I trace back the steps to see if theres anything left .but Im having no luck.But thats the funny thing about your first love , puppy love ...you will have respect and hold them dear and close to your heart forever even if they never come back .tho the years have come and gone .I fake it all pretend to be strong , put on a happy face.Because saying "I love you" has been a waste , in a sense .The small sad truth is I wouldnt have wanted to give my heart to anyone but you .pathetic I may be , crazy no not I , But my love for you has not died .

I cannot voyage furthermore   on my own emotions pallid and weak.   For weakness speaks endlessly through another’s words.   A blank face, a wall,   and I cannot whisper into that glaring silence   Impossible.   with tainted words of my own.      The void and I await the meaning.   Gazing dry mouthed at dwindling reality   as a new age forms.   Hopeless and clinging to the continual thought   that one day,   in a forgotten future,   a notion which I cannot provide   will speak my words unspoken.

A man passes me in a hurry,   Lines of concentration on his brow,   Swirls of anxiety in his wake,   While a silver haired old lady   Peruses the wine labels, half smiling.   I wonder if she's planning a romantic dinner.   Two small children pass in a cloud of laughs,   Ignoring the cries of a harried mother   And hiding round the corner of the bread rolls.   Waiting breathlessly, wide eyed, grinning.   A pair of teenagers lounge studiously,   Studying the CD racks with one eye   And a couple of girls with the other,   Exuding nonchalance and pheremones.   People in shop uniforms bustle,   Filling shelves, sweeping, giving directions   With fixed grins, genuine grins, warm smiles,   An occasional grimace.   White, black, brown, yellow,   They're all here, and then gone again,   Replaced minute by minute.   Where do they come from?   Where do they go?   What do they do, think, want, dislike?   How many are saints, sinners, lunatics?   Are any of them aware of me? Each other?   Oh, my line is moving,   Got to go

20090226133848AAtpX9A	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	If science managed to ressurect people, how would it affect your faith?	Seeing that many religions have a very direct and specified belief in the soul and the afterlife, such as going to heaven/hell, or being reborn, how would the ressurection of people affect such faith?      For clarity, the people ressurected would have no recollection of anything since they died. It would feel like it was just a second ago.

Or are they able to function like cogs in a machine to create something greater than the sum of its parts; a unified goal?       What I see around me is a veritable pantomime of squabbling self-interest we’ve dubbed democracy in a desperate bid to save ourselves from some “unnecessary” social surgery; with companies and individuals (by that I mean the general populace, myself included) that fight, undermine, ridicule, doubt and exploit each other, whose only goals are to realise their own putridly self-centred lives and pass on their DNA.       I know it will be difficult for you to divorce this question from oversimplifying the issue into capitalism vs communism, religion vs consumerism etc., but please try.

20090226143445AAoO8oU	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Would this be a good choice?	I am auditioning for a play in a few days and I was going to use a monologue from a scene from the actual play being done.   On the sign ups, its says to prepare a contemporary monologue for auditions, or there will be a cold reading script from the actual play available.   If you audition with a monologue from the actual play(I wont read it there I will actually have it memorized) would that lessen your chances of making the cut?

What does this mean         How I Became a Black Belt                   by Jeff Mondak           A week ago Sunday with weather so warm,   karate class met in the park.   We practiced our kicks, then we studied our form   and chopped at the sycamore bark.      I sat and I rested beneath that great tree   while Christopher worked on his stance.   My mind was so focused that I didn’t see   the ants marching straight up my pants.      The ants in my britches were biting me there.   The bite marks were starting to swell.   I itched, so I kicked and I clawed at the air,   then spun as I let out a yell.      I twirled and I jumped with such dizzying speed   while trying to scratch at the bites.   The teachers looked on and then quickly agreed   my skills had reached masterful heights.      For twenty-three minutes I pranced without pause.   I shrieked at each itchy red welt.   I finished at last to the master’s applause.   He bowed and he gave me his belt.

And this is when we begin to pace,   Up and down,    Up and down,   Meanwhile being followed around   By an angry bull, watching, waiting,   Writhing  ruthlessly in anger and   Undeniable agony!    But, amidst this display of testosterone,   And mindless violence,   We find the smiling Lee,   And ask him about his apparent glee,   He turns to us and speaks:   “I punched Aaron in the balls!”

Ive been thinking about attending Vocaltech after I finish my GCSEs.   The only way to attend is winning the scholarship because my mum cant afford it and she doesnt believe in me but I do and I want to prove to her that I have what it takes. I have to send an audio cd of me singing for 5 minutes. I havent made a decision of what to sing so i need some ideas.    Oh by the way ive never sang infront of anyone properly but im working on that. Ive never had any lessons with a teacher also.      The songs must be in pop rock jazz or RnB.      I was thinking of songs by:   Rihanna    Leona Lewis    Demi Lovato    Ashlee Simpson    Ashley Tisdale   Miley Cyrus - not so sure on her :/   Fergie   The Pussycat Dolls   Taylor Swift   Beyonce   Avril Lavigne - when your gone   Jordan Pruitt and others      Please suggest lots of songs and the artist to sings it if not on the list

20090226150021AAt7HxQ	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	What is a good Online Photo Printing Service in Canada?	I am an amature photographer in NB Canada. Only photo printing places in my city is Walmart and Staples. I am looking to print large size prints, up to 20x30 and I am also looking to print panoramic photos of various sizes. I am hoping to sell these prints (not for a high price, Im only an amature) ...       I would like to know of some good online photo printing services that print in high quality.... Im guessing Walmart poster prints of 20x30 are poor quality? I have never used Walmart for this size, have you? what did you think?       I am also on a very tight budget, I am looking for as low price as possible, also a service that will ship my prints to me at a decent price.      I was thinking of using Walmart, but I need advice on that. Id really like to know what is the largest size you've printed at walmart (also what megapixle camera u used) and how did it turn out??      Thanks to all who can help me out with this.      PS...I have a 10 megapixel DSLR.

20090225112633AAG2QsJ	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Tell me what you think of this poem?	I try to write, but I ramble...          I try to write what I feel but it never comes out in that special way,   I get confused and think to hard, too many words coming across my brain,   I want to be something I am not, I want to think the right thing to say.   I want you to feel what I feel, I want you to read my mind.      But that is hard work for you, for you to read my mind, is it even possible?   You don't see what I go through, I wish on the stars you could,   Day after day thinking of what and who and when, constant streams of words,   It is a pain for me, that you, are not with me on this.      I get confused, I live in constant confusion,   I try to write it down, sometimes, but it never comes out beautiful, just ugly,   It never sounds like anything worth reading- so I throw it away,   Just rambles of a amateur who just wants to be...in love.      These days of spring-   They are all jumbled together in one big mess of things,   Just like these words,   Just like my thoughts, jumbled in one big mess of things.      A big mess of things- yes...a mess...      So I try,   I try every night to write what I know,   But I do not know much, no I am not a genius,   You are blessed you see, to have a clear mind.      He is yours, I realize that- he knows how to write   I see this now again, I didn't see it before...or maybe I did?   I tried so many years ago- when I was younger, when my mind was clearer,   Now all I do is ramble...      ...I ramble on about my pain...   ...I ramble on about my thoughts...   ...I ramble on about my words...   ...I ramble, ramble, ramble...      So put on your dress shoes and dance with him- it will help you think clear,   He will show you and tell you what I cannot, I give up on trying-   He will give you that masterpiece, he will give you the right words.   And I will try to write what I feel, even though I don't know how      to feel...      This poem is not a masterpiece- I will never write one of those,   This poem is not for you, this poem is for me, is this poem you?   These are some words I put together, not very well I know-   But maybe you can read between the lines, maybe you will read it properly.      Maybe just maybe you can decipher my code, But in the end I will just ramble...on...and on...   It's  what I do,   It is the rambles that you need to pay attention to.

20090226145902AAP8y1N	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	Ethical Question...........?	I am in a digital imaging class and we had a guest speaker last week who showed us how to do this really cool technique. Well, its more like a style. Anyways, I LOVE the style and went through some of my work and created the same style from some of my own images. I LOVE them, but some how feel guilty because it was someone else's idea. I mean, common sense tells me that if the artist didnt want others mimicking the style they wouldnt have done the demonstration. Its not an original style, I have seen other pictures done the same way, but didnt know how to do it before.      But, I am in a really good spot going back to school, and I dont want to do anything that makes me look unprofessional. Is it ok for me to post the images I created from my own work as my own creation, even though it wasnt my own idea?
20090226150554AA5Fyan	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Drawing & Illustration	How do you think people will react to me if I pose nude with another male model for a drawing group?	I'm an part time male figure model, I pose for local colleges, a community art center and individual artists, been doing it for a few years now. I've told my family & friends that I pose and if they were interested showed them photos of some of the drawings I posed for. They've been very supportive overall however I do get some kidding from time to time but for the most part it's harmless fun. Now one of the groups I pose for asked me to pose with another male model and they want a pose with us interacting with each other, embracing or hugging. I have concerns about this. What if he's got a better shape than me, What if he gets an erection? What if I get an erection? What if I don't get an erection? I've never posed with another model before I'm straight and in the back of my head I'm thinking that posing with the same gender might type me as not straight. I keep telling myself that I'm a professional model and this is just role playing. Is this normal should I be worried or concerned about this?

20090226150906AAi6s1i	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Readers and Writers: Need a second opinion the opening of a novel...?	This applies to writers, but primarily readers...      Let's say you pick a novel up from a shelf at Barnes and Nobles and you begin thumbing through the beginning. There's no prologue and the story jumps in at a point in which there is a news pundent going on about the setting of the story, at the beginning of the next page the main character is introduced as watching the pundent indifferently.       From there movement occurs and over the course of the events taken place in the first chapter, we learn of supporting characters and also the springboard that launches this story into full-on motion.      Now, my question for you all is simple:      A) Is this an 'acceptable' opening that gives information as the first chapter unfolds? I mean, you have to set a mood, right?      B) Should character introductions come before establishing a context/tone for the book? Because exposition is a no-no and literary rules are rules that any credible author should abide by.      Or...      C) Does it rely whole-heartedly on the author and his/herreaders' preferences? It is their mutual choice after all.      Thanks.

I didn't have a partner, so I didn't get to participate in the lessons, just watch.   When one song came on everyone knew to do a certain dance. I don't know whether it was Bavarian or common knowledge - seemed familiar.   Anyway you joined hands, facing each other, kinda scoot-hopped together sideways 7 times, clapped once, rejoined hands, scoot-hopped 7 times back in the other direction, clapped, and repeated a couple times, then locked together by the elbow, and went in circles as is common with your free hand straight up in the air, then started the whole thing over.      Just a name, brief origin, or anything really would be helpful. I'm an idiot when it comes to dancing. x_x

So here's the deal a talent show is coming up & me and my best friend is planning on doing it together. The thing about this is im going to sing and she's going to play it on her guitar. Yes were doing acoustic, but the downfall is we've been searching for different songs & really can't make up our mind. It can be any song, as long as we can convert it into a acoustic medley. Have any suggestions? BTW, some songs were into are:      aly and aj- rush   love story-taylor swift   crush-mandy moore   crush-david archuleta   tattoo-jordin sparks       & the list goes on.......any suggestions?

20090226154959AAGy8oH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	HP7: Raining offices at the Ministry?	I have a theory about the raining offices at the Ministry of Magic during the course of the seventh book. Everything that supports this can be found in A) the chapter of Harry's hearing in OOTP and B) the chapter in which the trio infiltrates the Ministry in DH.      THE EVIDENCE:   In the fifth book, Mr. Weasley tells Harry that the Ministry has enchanted windows. The Ministry is far underground, so there would obviously nothing to see through the window if it wasn't charmed. Every day, Magical Maintenance chooses the type of weather that is seen through the 'windows'. (Mr. Weasley distinctly mentions that there were two months of hurricanes when the MM staff wanted a raise.)   In book 7, Yaxley's office rains. Mr. Weasley is talking to Ron (who's disguised as Reg Cattermole) about it. Mr. Weasley tells him something along the lines of, "Did you try Meteolojinx Recanto? It's worked for the other people."      THE ANALYSIS:   I think that someone from Magical Maintenance was responsible for the raining offices. It'd be right up their alley (I mean, creating the illusion of weather isn't very different from creating weather). I personally believe that there was at least one person on MM who was secretly against Voldemort. This doesn't mean that they were part of the Order; it just means that they opposed him and his Death Eaters.

20090226080204AAMVFud	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this story?	Blood sprayed out of the corpse of the man who leapt off the roof of the skyscaper when he hit the concrete below. Everyone surrounded the broken body and murmered their guesses as to what may have made him jump. Women screamed and men shouted. Many of the people there stood in awe at the sight of the man on the sidewalk. Among all the rabble and chattering, the trees around the city sat with their leaves in silence. The wind had stopped blowing its mighty torrent and the buildings seemed to have gone dark. The sun sank beyond the horizon, drawing the drapes of night over the city. Within minutes, everything went dark...      Jasper sat up out of bed. He felt his heart thudding inside him. He felt cold sweat roll down his face. He looked around the dimly lit appartment. He was alone in bed. He wasn't lying dead on the concrete anymore...      "What...?" he began. Suddenly he recalled the events of that day. The old man Jasper met on the roof told him that his life would be restored at sunset of every day that he killed himself and he would be forced to live a life worse than the one he had. He looked around the room. Everything was normal. Nothing was worse than he thought. Had it been a dream? It seemed so real.      Jasper got out of bed and went to take a shower. After the shower he shaved. As he shaved, the razor cut open his chin. Blood came out of the wound, red smeared the white cream. Jasper looked at himself in the mirror.      You will live a life worse than the one you had before.      Jasper couldn't help but laugh. He gave a light chuckle and began rinsing his face. In a way, the dream was right. He cut himself, something he seldom ever did. He moved out of the bathroom and dressed himself. He went into the bathroom to hang his towel but this time he refused to look in the mirror. Jasper hated the way he looked. He had green-gray eyes and eyebrows that refused to ever be kempt. He had a round nose that, to him, seemed like a bubble waiting to pop. He had some minor acne around his chin and nose and he was develping wrinkles under his eyes.      Jasper left his house in a solemn mood. He left the apartment complex and suddenly saw that clouds had shrouded the sky. A storm? He sighed. He hated the rain. He didn't go back to get an umbrella. He didn't see the point in getting one. He pants always got wet anyway.      Jasper walked down the sidewalk with his hands in his pockets. He felt so alone in the mass of people that walked in the same direction as he did. He looked around at all the people in their fluffy rain coats and fancy pants and skirts. Everyone was smiling and chattering with each other. He was truly alone...      Jasper felt the wave of depression roll across his life again. He couldn't take it anymore. He was going to act out his dream. He would leap from the tallest skyscraper he could get into. He found on of decent size across the street. The light signalled for him to cross. Jasper trudged towards the building. Just then, a small Beamer shot around the corner and slid on the wet ground. Jasper had little time to react. He jumped to the side but the car clipped his thigh.      Jasper spiralled into the air, his left leg twisted into a position it should not have been. He landed squarly and crumple down in a heap. He leg burned with pain. He let out a scream of agony.      You will live a life worse than the one you had before.      Jaspers eyes shot open wide. Was it true? Was it a dream? Did it really happen? People on the sidewalks stopped to look but none came to his aid. No one came to his side. Jasper knew it was this way and felt depression wrap around him again. He began crying on the spot. Someone came up to him and asked if he was alright.      "GO AWAY!" Jasper barked, baring his teeth. He knew that the person only came because of pity, not because he cared about him... Jasper saw a cars zipping by the scene. Jasper stood on his good leg and timed the movements of the cars. Here came a semi-truck. Jasper leapt forth. He saw the car slam into him and then everything became silent, still... dark once more.      With a jolt, Jasper sat up in his bed. He was beaded with cold sweat. His heart was pounding in his chest. He looked around the room. He felt himself... This was impossible... Then he remembered.      You will life a life worse than the one you had before.

20090226154522AArViaM	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Anyone else tired of Twilight?	I'm not saying that the books are bad. I do like them. But since the movie came out, it's all way to Harry Potterish for my tastes. I took me forever to get into Harry Potter, due to the fandom. Fans are so, obsessive(and I know that I'm often one of them), but with something like this, it seems like it's all ANYBODY thinks of.      Yes, the books are good.       But they're not top-notch quality, they're not all that is out there.       I'm tired of hearing about how Edward sparkles, and that makes him so sexy, or how he's the perfect man. He's not. He's a great person, and one made just for Bella, but he's not what every girl wants.       I'm also sick of the Team Edward vs Team Jacob. Seriously. Chill out.
20090226154209AAhrkQt	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Wouldn’t it be fascinating if you could download knowledge?	Imagine a word in which knowledge could simply be downloaded. They say the human mind if like a computer. Well, what if we found a way to save all our memories and information onto chips? Following this, the geniuses of the world could simply put their thoughts into the store.       Now two things could follow this hypothetical situation: One being that people grew to be exceedingly lazy (now this much is somewhat inevitable). No one would do anything.      Or, two, we would find these newly implanted ideas to be greatly motivating and could branch off from them to become so much more then that which we are.      My question: Which path do you presume we’d take?

I have to do a piece of art related to the romantic period of art for an art class I am taking. I need some ideas on what to do.      I don't have to do anything in specifics, but something that has to do with one of the following:   One of the artists from the romantic period   Something that tells a story or is entertaining   Something that has to do with a dream...      etc.      I know that a lot of landscapes were done in this period of time, but I don't really enjoy doing landscapes, and I just finished a big landscape and I'm a bit burnt out on them.      I prefer to do portraits and the like.         Thanks in advance :)
