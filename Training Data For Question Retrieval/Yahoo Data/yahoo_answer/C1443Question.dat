20090202153035AAdJnS9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you find that other religions/beliefs may have important aspects?	I do not consider myself as having a religion, but instead have personal and independent beliefs.       And while I disagree with the idea of having an organized religion, there are many that I read about that have some points and beliefs that I find important- some of those I take to heart and will try to use in life. Many have something different to tell about life, or tell about something in a different perspective. Through reading about religions from around the world and from many different types of people and using them collectively, I think I can improve myself and my life.      For example, in my curiosity and interest in religions, I've been reading about the left-hand path for some time now. In religions such as LaVeyan Satanism and the Temple of Set, I've found that they have some good points that I feel could be useful throughout life.      On the completely other side of the spectrum, I find that even Christianity has some good points and beliefs that I can use.      Do you find beliefs and points in religions and beliefs (aside from your own) that you have found important and taken in?
20090202153816AAVfJGF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think of this term ?	While reading a book by a Christian pastor I noticed he did not ever refer to atheists, agnostics, and the religiously unaligned as "lost" or "sinner" or "unchurched" or "prospects." He simply called them "unconvinced people."       This seems a more respectful and less loaded term when discussing those who do not hold a religious belief versus those who do.       What do you think?

20090202155741AA9tmCe	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why Do You Believe In God?	or not believe in God? I'm not your stereotypical over the top Christian but I do believe in God. I answered a question like this before with:      Because there has to be someone more powerful than ourselves. I understand how and why you can be an atheist we don't have any proof that there is a God and sometimes people just like the feeling of believing in something mysterious and magical like santa claus (sorry for the horrible comparison). A lot of people just go by what their parents taught them which is mostly true in my case but I have questioned my beliefs more than once. I just feel like there has to be something or someone that can explain how we got here, where we came from so on and so forth. I've lived a good life for the most part and I have a hard time believing that's just because I'm lucky. :)"      And I got reported?

20090202173621AAsZVEO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is the purpose of punishment not to teach?	Is not the point of rational, just punishment to teach the misdoer not to do what they're being punished for? For the purpose that they will learn and realize they have hurt someone or something? To correct them, so to help them on the rest of their life's journey?      Do we agree that hell does not leave room for learning? For that correction? To be disciplined and then sent on your way a better person is not the purpose of hell, I'm sure we'll also agree, as hell is ETERNAL punishment.      Then what IS the purpose of hell, if not sadism, if not injustice, if not god getting back at anyone who ever did anything wrong and did not formally repent? Does god get the satisfaction of knowing that anyone who did not follow him will be in pain forever?      The strictest of parents, the most severe, the least loving, would not cause extended pain to their own child. Not without being diagnosed with a dangerous mental disorder. So what does this say of god, who supposedly IS loving, and IS forgiving?

20090202182538AAZK1P6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	About Mormon's beliefs...?	I like this guy who goes to my school. On his myspace, it says he is a Mormon. Well, who knows, he could just be joking.   Which got me thinking. I'm not affiliated with any religion. I'm not atheist, I'm agnostic. BIG difference.   Well, anyway. If he really is, I would like to know a little bit about what Mormons are and their beliefs. It would be great if Mormons answer this.   And by Christians, I mean Lutherans, Roman Catholics, etc.      First off, what are Mormons views on Gays and Lesbians. There are some Christians who support gays and lesbians, and some who condemn them. Is this the same for Mormons?   What about suicide? There are non-believers of many religions who think it's a ridiculous thing to do to yourself, and some Christians believe you go to hell if you commit suicide. And rare occasions, there are Christians who think it's bad, but try to see the good in it and do not condemn the person.   Do Mormons share similar beliefs as in the bible as Christians? Or are they different.      Everyone's views are different even if they're affiliated with the same religion. So I guess it's just a matter of talking to him, and asking him. I'll probably only ask these questions if we actually start going out.   If he is, I'd like to ask him some questions. It would be one more thing for me to learn about.

And if you dont have a religion, your not a Atheist.  You just havent heard what you need to hear yet.  Which is fine, especially in this day an age.  So I dont really believe you are a Atheist, I just think your still a stubborn child, who doesnt want to learn to share.  So tell my why you are a Atheist, other then the bad stuff thats happened in your life.  Because let me tell you, thats life.  Thats what Our Savior went through, so If you have gone through something terrible.  Your closer to Christ then you think.       Thanks for your answers.  .

20090202190431AAJyeK1	Society & Culture;Royalty	Are there any notable people who claim that they are the true British monarch due to succession errors?	I heard that there was a guy in Australia (or somewhere) that claims he should be on the throne as King in place of Queen Elizabeth II.      The basis of his claim is that the wrong person ascended the throne centuries ago.  The "wrong person" became the Monarch either by error, or in a violation of the law, or through some other wrongful act.      This guy who claims to be King is a direct descendant of the person who SHOULD have been made the Monarch at the time.  Therefore, if that was really wrongfully denied the throne, then this guy today would have a case.      Have you heard of him?  Or anyone like him?

20061127175833AA4DluH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people keep telling me to go to church when I prefer to pray at home?	Everyone I know tells me that I should start going to church again, even though I tell them that I'm a spiritual and religious person every day, at home.  I say prayers, read the bible, other religious works, and say my rosary.  I'm Catholic, and used to love going to mass, but they have drastically changed the way they say the prayers now. They used to chant them, now they're sung to guitar.  In Mattew 6:6 "But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door,pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward the openly."  Isn't it okay to have a relationship with God at home?  Why do people that go to church try to make me feel like that's not enough, when I feel very religious and can quote the bible, too?

Pay little to no Property taxes. They also own 20 Acres of Beach Front Property on the Monterey Bay worth tens of millions of dollars. This is just one Church! This is just an example of how the Catholic Church at the Local Level has plenty of money.  Why would anyone donate One Penny to this Organization or Any religion is beyond me. All they have to do is dip in their own till.  They do not actually do any charitable or community work. They do not help the poor or provide any resourses for the less fortunate.

We speak same language. She is not bright at math as others so her boyfriend tells me to help her everytime he sees me. But not as a request, he asks as if he is telling me and thinks he is better than me. I overheard him say to his girl "if he is not helping you i will hit him" but no seriously but in a tough way. I don't know what should i do, this time i let him go but next time i will talk to him and if he doesn't listen i will beat the crap out of him. I don't like all this crap but the guy is an ***.

For Chinese and Japanese, I speak those languages pretty well but I have no knowledge of Vietnamese whatsoever. I know traditionally a name goes last name, middle name and given name. How do you create the middle/given name sequence? Like in Nguy?n T?n D?ng's name. If you switched T?n and D?ng around to D?ng T?n, would it still be able to be used as Vietnamese name? Is it like in an English name Anne Elizabeth can be switched around to Elizabeth Anne and still be a name? What words/sounds qualify as uses for Vietnamese names? In Chinese, Chinese words become the name but in Japanese, the names are pronounced differently as names than they would as words. Please help. I'm super confused. Thanks.

20090202212252AACq3jR	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Do many Muslims ever read the Qur'an?	Music is covered in Qur'an, 26:224-227, that says there are true followers among the poets.      This is true even of those who call themselves Muslims, is it not, that there are more that claim that title than who actually are following the faith?      So we are given instruction in Qur'an to discern among people who is true follower and who is not among Muslims, as well as among Christians and Jews, and so too among musicians and listeners. They are covered under poets and 2:227 says there are those among them who are true followers.      Qur'an does not forbid music, but so many Muslims think Qur'an does? Do many Muslims ever actually read the Qur'an and pay attention to what it says?

What are the advantages of choosing God over Ahura Mazda, Odin over Zeus, Kali over Ra? Believe it or not, people do still worship all of them, and as far as I can tell, none of them offer any more security in faith than any of the others.      Be honest... if your parents didn't teach you to believe in a certain god over another, would you?  If a Hellenistic Pagan had spoken to you before the Christian down the lane, would you have converted to that instead? They all offer basically the same things, so what is the difference? Why is one more valid than the rest?

20070408081959AAkoeJC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Muslims: Do You Actually Know What Your Saying When You Pray in Arabic?	Salaam,   If you are Muslim, I'd like to know if you actually know what you are saying when you pray in Arabic.      I'm not talking about, "Yea, I'm talking about God is one. No God but he. Strive for God." NO!      I'm talking about, can you actually recite something like Surah Al-Fatiha, or An-Nas in English or your native tongue (besides arabic)?      I've asked several Muslims friends/associaite/family members of mine and NONE of them know what they are saying, they all say that they "forgot".      How can you actually connect with God if you don't understand what you are saying?       Doesn't that make it more of just a ritual than actual prayer?      salaam
20070408085658AAapXly	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can Muslims understan the Koran when the Koran does not agree with itself?	according to some verses the apostles of Jesus Christ were Muslims (that is, those “who surrender themselves to God”) ; and also Abraham: “neither Jew nor Christian; but he was sound in the faith, a Muslim.” (Sura 3:60; 5:48, 111, Rodwell) But according to Sura 39:14 (Rodwell), Muhammad was the first Muslim: “SAY: I am bidden to serve God with a sincere worship: and I am bidden to be the first of those who surrender themselves to him, (Muslims).”      Again, according to Sura 2:59 (Rodwell) salvation is for others besides Muslims: “Verily, they who believe (Muslims) and they who follow the Jewish religion, and the Christians, and the Sabeites,—whoever of these believeth in God and the last day, and doeth that which is right, shall have their reward with their Lord: fear shall not come upon them, neither shall they be grieved.

I was quite shocked today, to see the episode of Good morning america ( Dian Sawyer in Saudi Arabia) , because although she gave some true pointers about the Saudi traditions and ways of life, she also gave some absolutely ridiculous ones, for example when she stated that Saudi's were building the "palm Jumeira" and Abu dhabi is building a version of the Louvre.....Abudhabi and Jumeira arent even part of saudi arabia, they are part of a country called the United Arab Emirates. And it is quite offensive to us, to be considered apart of their country, because we have our own traditions and ways of life. I just thought i should mention this, just to settle my own conscience.

I was wondering what any catholics think about Jesus being baptised in the manner He was.  Because He was baptised in water and instructed His followers to do the same, why are catholics baptised as babies?       I was reading on many catholic websites and even they say, "A person cannot be baptised unless he sincerely repents of his sinful nature "        In our church we are baptised when we decide to turn our lives to Jesus, realize we are sinners, and be baptised in the manner Jesus was. Not as a baby.      Just wondering what catholics think of being baptised NOT as a baby and their reasons as to why they are baptised as infants.  it says no where in the Bible to baptise a child but rather when you decide to turn to Christ.      Thanks

I don't know why do muslims want to get the christians out of the middle east if before islam the christians were living in those countries include saudi arabia during the life of mohammad but after mohammad died arabs conquest all the middle east. I don't know why if it was for religion or economy crisis but islam dominated the region and christians in palestine converted in a minority and now muslims in some posts  say: they are happy when a christian adopts islam as his or her religion.. when old islam says christians and jewish people are similar to islam and they have a place in the heaven.. well I don't remember the verse but it is in the chapter 2.. where if christians, jewish and sabeans believe in the last day and God.. of course they do but later mohammad changed to say islam is the only religion acceptable to God but during his life christians and jewish people were living in saudi arabia but when he died Abu Bakr changed everything?

20090203004034AAFuoWB	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Is there a polite way to ask someone to stop talking to you?	So there's this guy I met online. He's very nice, we share some common interests... but to be completely honest, he's just not fun or interesting to talk to. At all.      He sends me messages every day with generic greetings or emoticons and then he doesn't have anything to say besides that, and not only does it feel like a waste of time to read or respond to, but it's a little awkward, too.      I don't want to hurt his feelings for a lot of reasons: despite being annoying, he's actually a very nice guy, we're in a lot of the same online communities and I'll be seeing him around even if I block him, and also because he seems kind of socially awkward to begin with and might take it badly. Is there a polite way to tell him to stop messaging me all the time for no reason?

20090202234440AAjiBN3	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Muslims please your absolute honest answers?	Some priviliged people in this forum do not understand the struggles faced by people like me in recovering through trauma and rejection as intersex people and so will falsely accuse me of not having any real problems and only trying to get attention with my question.    Those people can eat my shoes.    For the rest of you, I need your honest answers.    Being an intersex person is a traumatic experience. At birth, instead of feeling love and celebration from the people around you, the doctors and your parents greet you with scorn, fear, and rejection. They call you a monster and say you are hideous. They hurt your soul from the very beginning of your life and the rejection continues throughout your life because you are different and everyone is so ignorant. Intersex people have a very high suicide rate and the ones who survive typically live extremely lonely lives, often not being able to have normal relationships or marry because other people are so ignorant and because of disorders from that trauma that further make them undesirable.    It is an extremely painful experience.    If you heard other Muslims talking saying things about another Muslim who is an intersex person and they were saying a bunch of wrong things because they are ignorant and make wrong assumptions and believe wrong things and have probably been taught wrong things, but you on the other hand have been educated about intersex people and so you can correct them,    WOULD YOU BOTHER TO CORRECT THEM?    This is a very very important question for me. I need to know if there are any true followers or just a bunch of phoneys. I need the true followers to show up and support me please. Where are you?

I realize I toss around language a bit more hastily than I ought to but I fear that I am going to screw myself one of these days. Now the incident was today at school and we were split off into groups and I ended up with this pretentious little thing. So we eventually got into a power struggle over some philosophical thing (can't remember what exactly) and whenever I take a position I am unassailable, you should see me. She was like that too. Well no good could come of this and she eventually said "Listen I'm an honors student." To which I replied this little Gem "Yeah and I'm a psychopath but you don't see me bragging about that. Probably because neither one of those things is very good to mention to people and could certainly not improve ones own appearance." I think it's pretty clever but I admit it was dangerous and a really childish thing to say, I smoothed it over with that little bit on the end. How can I stop trying to earn respect through intimidation?

20090202214908AASwpyk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people care about Obama's religion......?	During the campaign people were spreading rumors about obama being a muslim.   Even though he is obviously not why would it matter,  why is it that people only care about whether he is or isnt muslim when Thomas Jefferson himself had one of the first copies of the Qu' ran in english in america, which is still held in in a special place in the library of congress in DC.  On top of that a congressman from montana (i think), Keith Ellison is a muslim and he was elected in '04 and NO ONE MENTIONED IT EVER.   Also running for president and being christian didnt become a major part of politics until the early 1900's  so what purpose does ones religion have in electing them president.         Personally i feel that the separation of church and state would imply that anytime one looks to ANY religion for an answer in politics, his/her answer becomes invalid(at least in this country).         So again,  why does it matter?

I got into an argument with an Englishman a while ago about the whole "Americans are Stupid" thing, and his main argument was that Americans are largely monolingual, and only speak English.      I (Trilingual American Foreign Languages Student) said: "Well here's something. The United States is flanked on either side by thousands of miles of ocean. We have English-Speaking Canada to the North. And Spanish-Speaking Mexico to the South. A lot of people in the US speak Spanish. The French-Speaking part of Canada is pretty far from the border, and surrounded by the English-Speaking part, so we don't get much influence from them. But YOU on the other hand--you're from England. England, which is basically surrounded by French-Speaking France, Spanish-Speaking Spain, German-Speaking Germany, Dutch-Speaking Holland, and all the rest. Why don't YOU speak more than one language? Doesn't the fact that you live in such close proximity to the namesakes of these languages actually make you more ignorant than I would be--as a Stupid American--for not knowing them?"      What do you think? Was I wrong in my logic?

Or is that just the total cost for the like the food/hotel/camp/trip in Mecca?      Thank You.

"According to greek mythology, humans were originally created with 4 arms, 4 legs and a head with two faces. Fearing their power, zeus split them into two separate parts, condemning them to spend their lives in search of their other halves."      ...But I wanted to know if there was any artwork specifically related to it. Also I'm a bit confused on the name. I've heard crab theory but I can't verify it anywhere.

20090202232505AAAbHIu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	To all the atheists, and believers in God?	Peace be with you all      To the atheists, I ask a simple question and to the believers in God, this question may just increase your belief in God.       ~~Before anything, I would like to request, we keep this to an appropriate level, and no inappropriate answers~~      Okay, so here's the question.       If there's a man who's been living for the last ten years on a machine that enables him to breath, because he can't do so himself, and over those ten years you (doctor) have been trying different methods to enable him to breath without assistance, yet, you have been trying for the past ten years with no luck, and there's many people waiting to use the machine as well who have worsening breathing problems. Would you take him off the machine, and let him die, or let him use it? Now logic would say, well there are many people waiting to use it, who's lives are at risk and this person has had a decade to use it, it would be fair. But your logic+sympathy would say that maybe he could recover from this breathing problem and I don't him to die. And hence we come to a problem, we can't decide, it would be cruel to let him die, but it would be unfair to let other people die as well, because he's been using it for 10 years. You see these kind of situations are where you need DIVINE guidance; God. God is all-knowing, and God would know what's best, but we don't have the intelligence to judge FAIRLY which would be the fair choice. So to those atheists how can you deny that you don't need divine guidance for these kinds of predicaments?  In these sorts of situations, you need guidance from God, so how can you deny there is a God? And if you do, then how would you fairly make a choice in the situation I presented?       ~Remember to keep this appropriate, no descrimination or hurtful comments please~ Thank-you!      Peace be with you all

I really love the nature here in canada but alot of people are just f***cked...      my biggestHobbie like sport biking are here not possible because of the 5 months of snow we got and the season is way to short, the roads to ruff... I was able to do that in Switzerland.      Here in canada i just got problems with the family of my ex, my cousin and more...      I broke up with my ex 3 weeks ago because i finally realized that she was the biggest golddigger and crackhead that you can find out there, and i dont need that crap... she would f*ck of for weeks and come back all wasted...!      Then my best buddy told me that my super nice cousin is together with my ex since a week...But he has a kid with her sister... he is on stressleave because of drug problems but now he doesnt do better he drinks and uses drugs... so anyways they are together... I am really choked because i helped him out everytime noone was there for him, he did 6 days coke- straight! Everyday he blew 100$ and i let him sleep at my appartment because he was affraid to go back to his parents. And now he says I am just an indiot and i cant handle the ex because he thinks shes so hot...! It hurts me and so that guy is just dead for me, he can look for other stupid people... his whole family, sister, brother, parents start to get against him because he is a f*ck up...      The whole year, christmas, new years i had to deal with that **** here in canada that i wouldn't have to in switzerland and i just get really sick and tired of that crap! I don't want it anymore...      Now im not sure if i shall go back to switzerland and drive my bike and have my sister, brother, mother and go back to canada in a few years because i got my permanent resident card...      I really don't know what to do right now...      greetings
20090202233148AAZ1h6n	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why or why not should these two women be hanged?	the first is an 18 year old mother of a two year old baby.  The baby fell and hit his head causing a fatal injury while being whipped by his mother with a belt for not using the toilet.  The mother did not intend to kill her baby.  But it is clear her excessive, inappropriate, and abusive punishment of him caused his 'accidental' death.  Should the woman be hanged.      The second woman, another 18 year old was riding through with her 20 year old boyfriend when the pair stopped to rob a convenience store. While the woman waited near the door as a look out; the man while pointing a gun at the store clerk 'accidentally' fired it killing the 16 year old clerk.  Should the woman be hanged for participating in this crime?      What are the arguments either for or against execution in either of these cases?

Most people believe that Jesus went around teaching a bunch of unrelated short stories that readers gets to interpret any way they want.        The Bible, on the other hand, states that this gospel is an "orderly account ....so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught."      If we take the Bible at its word, then       1. What is the section of the orderly account (one account) being taught    ....that we (all readers) can be certain.      ("All readers being certain of what they were taught" would require readers to be unified in their understanding of what was the issue and how the teaching was applicable...What a novel idea!)      2.  And how does this parable fit together with the surrounding parables since an orderly account requires that there is a logical sequence?

20070602122716AAvZ7vS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Para adventistas: Si la biblia profetiza desastres ?Por que Dios no hizó nada para detenerlos?	Un adventista de por mi casa afirma que las se?ales de que cristo llegará pronto se encuentran en las profecias "cumplidas" de la biblia sobre desastres como los del 11 de septiembre.      ?Que opinan ustedes, es eso lo que predica su iglesia o solo la opinión de ese hombre?      Pienso que un dios que sabía de antemano la angustia de las victimas al momento del secuestro, la muerte de 3000 personas, además de ser conciente del dolor de sus parientes y que NO hiciese algo para evitarlo se me hace absurdo.       Pero más poco ético me parece que tal deidad omnisapiente hubiese previsto este desastre como una simple noticia profética para anunciar su segundo regreso, como un evento más en su calendario profético. Tal cosa me perece más propia de un ser absurdo, grotesco e inmisericorde que de un ser amoroso y con sentido ético. Perdóneme si le ofendo, pero es lo que pienso.      Pienso igual de cualquier desastre que los fanaticos religiosos interprtean como prueba de la verdad de la biblia.

20090202194809AAjuMpT	Society & Culture;Languages	Will somebody please translate this to French for me?	Last August, I went on a trip to Ireland and England. I went with my boyfriend, my mom, my dad, my brother, my friend, her friend, her mom, and her mom's boyfriend. I left Tampa on August first, and landed in Ireland on August second. While I was there, I met my boyfriend's parents, saw castles, and went horseback riding on the beach. I had an amazing time. After spending 7 days in southeastern Ireland, we drove to Dublin so we could get a plane to London. There were flash floods in Dublin and we got stuck in traffic for about 4 hours. We finally got to the airport, and we were on our way to London. When we got to London, we checked into a hotel that a friend of our's owns. We saw a lot of historical buildings, visited the museum, and went to the zoo. I rode on a train for the first time in my life. London was a lot of fun, but I liked Ireland better.         Thank you so much!

It is a four day long camping trip and sounds like a lot of fun. The only thing is, it's a camp their church is putting on for their Young Women's group. I am not a member of this church or the group, and the only girls I know from it are from school. The mom told me that there will be 5-6 girls who are also not members, which makes me feel a bit better. She also said that if I wanted, I could go to their Tuesday activities (not very religious, more of the fun stuff) to meet the girls. I just feel a little weird about it, like I'm "invading" their group or something. It's also weird because my friend who is a member is a few years older than I am and we have recently grown apart. I want to go and it sounds like fun, I'm just worried that the girls will think I'm weaseling into their group (it's a close-knit circle). What do you think? Am I over-analyzing the situation? What would you do if you were one of the girls in the group? What would you do if you were me?

20090202195824AAhWOL2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think God hates me or is punishing me?	My wife left 1-9-09. She has moved in with a guy. Yes as a couple. She is 27 and I found out he is 37. She moved out of here and straight there. I also just found out that him and his wife separated in November. It my have something to do with my wife. Don't know that for sure. They both work at the same place. Friday night I called her. Yea to see if she would come home. She told me how happy she is and how much better in bed he is. Also I let her take the kids Thursday. She told our kids that her bf can't wait to meet them and she was getting a puppy. I will not let her take them around him. I told her to give the kids time to adjust and she said she has. 3 weeks!! She also told me she is going to take the kids. I have filed for custody. I don't think I can do that again. We have two kids together that are with me. We have been married 8 years.I thought everything was fine. We had a few spats. But we were doing better than ever with jobs,credit and getting along. She has done this before. Will that relationship last? Do you think she will get payback for doing this to me and my kids? No this is not any of my business. I just want my chance to turn her away like I should have done years ago. The only reason I ask is because I really tried the last two years. It looks like she came out so much better after doing this to us. They have only been living together a few weeks so I will have to see.      I will add that she has done this so many time that the kids don't even miss her. Nothing has changed and one of them said they wanted to live with me because I was a better parent. Now that came from a 9 year old!      I don't want to see it last not because I don't want her to be happy. I just want to her to see that you don't walk out on your family for someone else!

I should start by saying that I live in the middle of nowhere, in a tiny town and over 100 miles from any decent-sized civilization.  I have been interested in Paganism for a few years now, and I have read some books on Wicca and other pagan paths, but now I don't know what to do with the information I've read.  I mean, it's all well and good to know what an athame is and what the different sabbats stand for, but that to me is just background knowledge.  I don't know what to do now that I've accumulated this knowledge.  I want to actually become active in my spirituality, but I don't know where to start.  I keep trying and get frustrated and then I get overwhelmed...      So what can I possibly do to feel like I am one with my spirituality?

If you are gay and both guys, why do you try to look like female? Or if both women gays, why try to look more male if you are attacted to women. If you are female and gay and attracted to female, why the partner tries to look male. Just odd to me is all. Not being mean honest.

I'm not used to having friends, because I've been friendless since 2002, by choise. Since I've joined facebook, like at least 30 people from highschool and earlier years have joined my page. I'm nervous as hell because I haven't had friends for so long. I just hung out with one of my old highschool friends today, and it was good, but the whole time I was nervous and awkward. I do want friends again, but I didn't expect so many ppl to want to reconnect with me. I'm afraid if I don't reconnect with all the ppl that want to reconnect with me, that they are going to feel rejected and like I'm just being picky. But I'm really not. I'm just overwhelmed and not used to socializing. What do I say, if I'm feeling too overwhelmed with so many ppl wanting to reconnect with me, without hurting their feelings, so I'm not feeling closterphobic with ppl?   I know most ppl probably think I'm crazy for asking this question, but when you haven't socialized with any friends for 7 years, then all of a sudden 30 ppl want to reconnect with you all at once, it's a huge culture shock.
20090202204626AABeIjQ	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Whats the matter with me?	Please help me out here. I am a sophomore in college and I have been diagnosed with a panic disorder. I also am suicidal. I have seen a psychologist at home and starting next week, will begin seeing a psychologist where I go to school. However, I am still suicidal and have been since last March. All my doctors and family know this, all my friends know. I cannot figure out why. I am a good student, who just switched majors to something that interests me (History and English), I have come out of the closet and have let those close to me know I am gay, I have joined a load of clubs to keep busy, I have a job, I love my school, I just cannot figure out why I still feeling like dying is a good idea. The bad things I can think about in my life are that : I am afraid that my close family and friends will reject me because I am gay(even though they have accepted me for being gay), I am an urban loving kid going to school in a small town even though I LOVE my school, I have a panic disorder, I have crushes on people who are straight, and I am afraid that my life will not get any better even though all my friends say my life will improve dramatically. I just dont see it. Can you please help me? Btw, I am Catholic so please dont tell me to reach out to Jesus, I have/am trying. Thanks!

so i make friends go one with my life and when wrestling season starts i get on the scale.... im 40 pounds over my wieght class.. so i begin cutting wieght and training again like a madman doing everything i can do to make wieght and thankfully i do... but every week i was cuttung about 15 poundsit was not fun... but i was the biggest heavy wieght anyone had ever seen... so the seasons going well hell at districts i break the record for most pins in a season with 33 pins... so regoins roll around the first day 2 quick pins yay 35 pins 37 and 2 all together.. the next day idk where i was i dont even remember the day really but i go 0-2 and its all over... my life is done. im heart broken, my girlfriend does all she can to help me feel better but it doesnt work.. to watch all other 5 senoirs go to state killed me inside... so begins the downword spirail... due to wrestling i never had the most outstanding

God taught him the Book - in other words, the Qur'an - in addition to the Torah and the Gospel (God knows best).      7. The People of the Book will obey him when he returns.      8. Those who follow him will be made superior to the unbelievers until the Day of Judgment.      9. He will return to Earth as an adult and will speak to people.      10.

What are they teaching you guys in church?      Last time I went, I was raised Baptist but converted to atheism in my late teens after a lifetime of doubt, unanswered questions and an honest disbelief in the existence of God, atheism wasn't synonymous with devil worship. In fact, it was a Sunday school teacher who first told me that atheists don't believe in God.

20070925123812AA7r11L	Society & Culture;Languages	Pronunciation of Mandarin (Ji1 = 乩) vs.(汁 = Zhi1)?	In Pinyin theory, the consanont "J" should represent the "dy" sound, but when I listen to CDs it sound so me like they are just pronouncing the consanant "J" as "J" as in English ("Just", "Jump" for example).      I know Mandarin speakers use Hanzi instead of characters, so I use Zhongwen Zi below as examples:      When you pronounce (就 = Jiu4) do you say the "dy" sound or the English "J" used in "Jump", "Just"        How does the pronounciation of (Ji1 = 乩) compare to (汁 = Zhi1)....Do you say the "乩" with a "dy" sound or an English "J" sound.      I think the best thing for me to do is to make a Mandarin friend, and hear him/her speak, but I have no Mandarin people in my surroundings or in my neighberhood ect. thus I ask this question on Y/A      Thank you for sharing your culture and your knowlege with me.

20081101093533AAU2znw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Respectful question for Christians who take the bible literally?	I can understand having faith in the Bible, what I have trouble with is insisting that each and every word is the word of God.      Isn't it more likely that it is MEN who demand the executions referenced in Exodus, Deuteronomy, & Leviticus rather than God (as Jesus pointed out)?  Isn't it more likely that trimming your beard is more of a social taboo than a sin (ref in Leviticus)?      Since the words in the Bible were told by men, eventually put to paper by men, edited by men, voted upon by men...how can you insist that it is ALL the word of God?

20090202195035AAoQwaY	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	How does a 747 crash into a building (the pentagon) without leaving wing impact marks or mechanical debris?	I'm not a conspiracy theorist, nor I do wish to perpetuate anything that undermines the real issue of 9/11 - the lost of lives.  I am however a logical thinker.  That being said, if you take a simple look (no deep examination is even required), you will see the impact area of the alleged plane crash at the pentagon, a nice sized hole in its walls, almost square in shape.  However regardless of which direction or angle the plane was going in, the size and shape of that "hole" and corresponding damage, does not correspond to the speed and weight and fuel carried by a MASSIVE passenger plane.  To bring it into perpective, think about this....if you painted your entire self in red paint, and then with your arms outstrecthed like a plane, ran full speed into a white wall, what would be the outcome?  Likely, you would receive most of the damage to your face since it would likely hit first.....HOWEVER the red paint would make marks and show that your arms also hit the wall on the left side and the right - going forward with that in mind, just take a look at any post impact pentagon pictures...where in the world are the 'red marks' for the wings on the left or the right....considering that the "hole" created by the alleged plane is only about 40 ft in diameter, furthermore the roof of the pentagon somehow managed to remain relatively intact, or atleast free from any "red marks" that would have been caused by the tail of the plane.  The Boeing 747's have a wingspan of atleast 195ft. to 224ft.  And they have a height of atleast 63ft.  Now I have not studied impacts or collisions or structural engineering or anything of the sort, but using simple math, it seems to me that at the very least, even from a 180 degree perfect vertical drop the size of the initial damage should be MUCH bigger.  Furthermore, video tape shows that the impact came from a more horizontal angle anyway.  So, the questions present themselves.  1) If the plane (allegedly a 747) hit the pentagon as shown in the media, How is it possible that the building had such minimal damage.....WITHOUT actual plane debris?  2) How is it possible that a plane with such huge dimensions could hit a wall from a relatively horizontal angle and leave no marks showing where the wings or tail hit??      As far as the who did it and why's, I don't know.  But I find that something does add up.  What do you think?

How come:   -women today usually try to be the "man" in the relationship?   -always like to prove themselves right then become angry when a man has proved them wrong?   -(younger women) usually try to provoke men to hit them and get the men in trouble. It happens too much in my school   - get the men to pay for things like child support, bills etc. when women fail to do so?   -end up kicking the men out of their house/bedroom when the woman feels angry?

20090202201613AAp6SB7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	To church folks! People that know what they talk about! PLEASE serious question :) ?	I don’t want people thinking I’m disrespecting or anything. I just have these questions and need good answers to put my mind at ease, thank you J       Why do Catholics smoke in their church? (Not literally like cigarettes) Is a thingy thing that shoots out smoke that is held by the priest. Smoke is bad for your health why is that thing allowed? It still smoke!      Why do people use crucifies and bow to the different statues and use different ornament? God is omnipotent! Alpha and omega. You need nothing! He is powerful and he can make things without the use of tools (Unless he ask you to get them) Why people use these things? I think god does not need tools because he is powerful and he does not need things like that. Don’t you?      Umm Me personally I’m not baptize.. And I don’t got the guts to get me baptize, I’m scare of it.. I don’t know exactly why.. So what will happen to me?      The practice of safe sex (I know is wrong outside of marriage and I pretty much agree) But been married and using condoms is wrong because “Is deifying god” How Come? I mean think about it a child is a big responsibility, and you and your wife have needs. Children are not to play around it is a life that is on your hands a human being’s life.. If You are aware that you are not ready and decide to practice safe sex… Why is it wrong? I’m been responsible, why is it bad?       War.. Is it truth that killing in war is ok? I really think is wrong.. I really doubt it.. But then I realize that some lands were given to people in the bible by means of War and bloodshed. Help.. I’m confuse with it.      Is it true that there is a guy mention in the bible who didn’t like Christians and he used to kill them and that he was changed all the sudden and then he was doing god’s will and did a lot of good for Christianity ever since?       Is it true that Jesus went to china and that the Chinese saw him as a envoy and had a name for him and they all and respected him like they respect those Buddha monks?        Why did god created a creature as evil as dinosaurs? I know there were good ones but why he would created the T-Rex knowing how vicious it would be?       I think that's all the questions that I can come up with, please decent answers to the ones you actually think you can answer..       Thank you and I really didn't mean to offend anyone Is just that I'm curious. :)

We were having discussions in the class, and i am an international student. Actually, i am still having ESL, English as an Second Language,but i volunteered to help to write down answers for the group extra credit. It wasn't me at first, but the girl asked me whether i'd like to do this. And i thought i can finally contribute something, because opinion would be the least thing that i can contribute . My group mates were very sleepy, and i didn't inform them that my English is bad. By the time i handed in the paper, my friend looked weird and said," You really need English tutoring." I was so guilty that i spoiled the 20 points extra credit because of my bad writing. I said sorry to some of them. Do you think it's better to apologize officially to all of them?Does the culture here like people apologize for something they did bad? I feel so bad, embarrassed and guilty.       You may think this is a little thing, but it affected me in a negative way. Also, i  want to say thank you for your patient if you read it. Thx^v^

20090202211525AAFtdIx	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this morally wrong for a Christian?	Ok, this might be hard to fully understand, but I'll try to explain it as clearly as I can. I'm a Christian(Not sure exactly what kind, like a Protestant, but I believe in God, Jesus, and all the standard stuff). Recently I've been looking at some kind of pornography(Here's the confusing part) that is referred to as "furry hentai". It isn't just sex, only about 20% percent of the images I have on my computer contain any form of sex, but they almost all have nudity. When I look at it I am sexually aroused, but I do not masturbate when I look at it. I do not in anyway AT ALL think about having sex with animals(I believe bestiality is one of the sickest things ever). I mainly look at it like most people would look at art like a painting or sculpture and just admire it. I can't really explain what it is that makes me admire it, but I do. My question is since it is STRICTLY 100% animated, I do not use it for masturbation, and it doesn't contain humans(So it isn't like I'm objectifying someone) is it really immoral for me as a Christian? I'm sorry if I couldn't explain it good enough.

Before any one says anything like it I'm not anti gay or any thing I'm bisexual and love and except my sexuality. It's just the entire gay marriage argument that gets me. I mean what is marriage but a way of showing just how committed you are to your partner in the eyes of the god of your respective religion, and I don't think we need any ones permission to do that. where do you stand on it.

20090202213033AA3xOqk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	To LDS members only, what do you think about the sermon of Bringham Young below?	My next sermon will be to both Saint and sinner. One thing has remained a mystery in this kingdom up to this day. It is in regard to the character of the well-beloved Son of God, upon which subject the Elders of Israel have conflicting views. Our God and Father in heaven, is a being of tabernacle, or, in other words, He has a body, with parts the same as you and I have; and is capable of showing forth His works to organized beings, as, for instance, in the world in which we live, it is the result of the knowledge and infinite wisdom that dwell in His organized body. His son Jesus Christ has become a personage of tabernacle, and has a body like his father. The Holy Ghost is the Spirit of the Lord, and issues forth from Himself, and may properly be called God's minister to execute His will in immensity; being called to govern by His influence and power; but He is not a person of tabernacle as we are, and as our Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ are. The question has been, and is often, asked, who it was that begat the Son of the Virgin Mary. The infidel world have concluded that if what the Apostles wrote about his father and mother be true, and the present marriage discipline acknowledged by Christendom be correct, then Christians must believe that God is the father of an illegitimate son, in the person of Jesus Christ! The infidel fraternity teach that to their disciples. I will tell you how it is. Our Father in Heaven begat all the spirits that ever were, or ever will be, upon this earth; and they were born spirits in the eternal world. Then the Lord by His power and wisdom organized the mortal tabernacle of man. We were made first spiritual, and afterwards temporal.       Now hear it, O inhabitants of the earth, Jew and Gentile, Saint and sinner! When our father Adam came into the garden of Eden, he came into it with a celestial body, and brought Eve, one of his wives, with him. He helped to make and organize this world. He is MICHAEL, the Archangel, the ANCIENT OF DAYS! about whom holy men have written and spoken--HE is our FATHER and our GOD, and the only God with whom WE have to do. Every man upon the earth, professing Christians or non-professing, must hear it, and will know it sooner or later. They came here, organized the raw material, and arranged in their order the herbs of the field, the trees, the apple, the peach, the plum, the pear, and every other fruit that is desirable and good for man; the seed was brought from another sphere, and planted in this earth. The thistle, and thorn, the brier, and the obnoxious weed did not appear until after the earth was cursed. When Adam and Eve had eaten of the forbidden fruit, their bodies became mortal from its effects, and therefore their offspring were mortal. When the Virgin Mary conceived the child Jesus, the Father had begotten him in his own likeness. He was not begotten by the Holy Ghost. And who is the Father? He is the first of the human family; and when he took a tabernacle, it was begotten by his Father in heaven, after the same manner as the tabernacles of Cain, Abel, and the rest of the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve; from the fruits of the earth, the first earthly tabernacles were originated by the Father, and so on in succession. I could tell you much more about this; but were I to tell you the whole truth, blasphemy would be nothing to it, in the estimation of the superstitious and over-righteous of mankind. However, I have told you the truth as far as I have gone. I have heard men preach upon the divinity of Christ, and exhaust all the wisdom they possessed. All Scripturalists, and approved theologians who were considered exemplary for piety and education, have undertaken to expound on this subject, in every age of the Christian era; and after they have done all, they are obliged to conclude by exclaiming "great is the mystery of godliness," and tell nothing.       It is true that the earth was organized by three distinct characters, namely, Eloheim, Yahovah, and Michael, these three forming a quorum, as in all heavenly bodies, and in organizing element, perfectly represented in the Deity, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.       Again, they will try to tell how the divinity of Jesus is joined to his humanity, and exhaust all their mental faculties, and wind up with this profound language, as describing the soul of man, "it is an immaterial substance!" What a learned idea! Jesus, our elder brother, was begotten in the flesh by the same character that was in the garden of Eden, and who is our Father in Heaven. Now, let all who may hear these doctrines, pause before they make light of them, or treat them with indifference, for they will prove their salvation or damnation.       I have given you a few leading items upon this subject, but a great deal more remains to be told. Now remember from this time forth, and forever, that Jesus Christ was not begotten by the Holy Ghost. I will repeat a little anecdote. I was in conversation with a certain lear

20090202212159AA56jj8	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Why is cancer such a complicated topic?	i have a little cousin called nicole, who is four years old. she is a very spoiled little girl, who always gets upset when she doesn`t get her own way. she was an only child raised by her single mother. aunt rose had recently got married again. her husband is a man called harry, who was a single father. he has a six-year-old daughter called jade. jade had also been greatly spoiled by her father, who doted on her. after the wedding, the two girls did not get along. nicole often tattled on jade and got her into trouble. jade thought nicole was an annoying little sister. unfortunately, jade got cancer and was in the hospital for ages. she had to undergo many treatments, including chemotherapy, which made all her curly hair fall out. when she got home, people gave her most of the attention. they let her have her own way because of her illness, which made nicole jealous and bitter. nicole feels ignored and left out. she threw temper tantrums and became greatly attention-seeking. she had even tried to fight with jade on some occasion.. there were times when she was mean to her sister. nicole had teased jade, called her names and took her anger out on her. when they go out as a family, jade might not feel well and they have to hurry her home. nicole would cry and scream because she wants to stay and play. aunt rose and uncle harry would just comfort her, saying"we have to go home now because your sister is tired. we will play later." what can i do to help them?

20090202213724AACvJlC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did Jesus willingly die for your sins, or was he killed against his will?	How can you say Jesus died for you when he didn't willingly die?  He was betrayed by Judas and died unwillingly.  Jesus even said, "Oh father, why have you done this to me!".  Doesn't sound like a guy who's willing to die for someone.  And since Jesus is God, and God can't die, how can you say Jesus died for you when he isn't even dead?  How is it a sacrifice when he gets killed and revives again?  If you're gonna say that Jesus had to endure the pain, what about the pain that God put upon the sacrificial animals he demanded?      Absurd, absurd, absurd....

It's been established that we both like each other and would like to see where it goes, but I wouldn't call us boyfriend/girlfriend just yet.  Valentine's Day seems like it's going to fall at that critical point in a relationship where you feel like you need to get them something to really let them know you like them and are interested, but not something too expensive or sappy because it's a little soon for that.  Any suggestions?  He's 38, divorced, no kids, an architect and a musician.  He likes unusual/new beers and wines (but I wouldn't know what to pick out).  I don't want to do a gift card of any kind, seems to generic and impersonal.  Help!!
