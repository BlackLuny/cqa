qA6PV4huaa	I'm presuming you're using 3rd edition GURPS here because of the reference to PD.      Damage is based on two things.  Powered attacks such as bullets and beam weapons have assigned damages and this is listed in the weapon tables.  Crossbows and bows are technically in this category but since most characters have Bows with ST scores equal to their own ST, it's easily overlooked.      Damage done by muscle generally do damage based on the Swing or Thrust scores of a character.  With modifiers for weapons that are usually -3 to +4.      In the case of your character a ST 14 person does a base thrust of 1d and base swing of 2d.  It's a convenient value to get simple values.      See the chart in Basic Set: for ST.  Each ST score has a swing and thrust value.      Katanas, like Bastard Swords (technically Katanas ARE Bastard Swords) are 'hand and a half' weapons and do a base damage of Swing +1 (cutting) and Thrust +1 (Impaling) damage.    The weapon table also assigns the parry.  In 3rd edition, the skill x 2/3rds is used for Katanas.  So if you have a skill of 15 your parry with a katana is 10 plus any PD your armor or shield (etc) gives, along with any bonuses from conditional modifiers that may be applicable.      PD and DR are assigned by armor and shields used.  In 4th edition PD is virtually gone.  It is no longer assigned to armor, just to shields, bucklers, cloaks or ultratech deflector screens.  And goes under the name Defense Bonus (DB) since it is no longer available passively you must make an active defense with whatever provides the DB.    I should point out that this board has effectively been dead for some years now.  Steve Jackson Bames put up their own forum back in 2004 and most GURPS forums of this sort have fallen over there.      http://forums.sjgames.com will take you there where you can get a lot more aid for both GURPS players and SJG employees.|`|kIqq7yIAaa	your damage is based on what style your character has taken  as martial arts come in 2 basic forms   karate, Tea-kwon-do are hard forms as is any form relying on strong attacks damage is usually d6 or d8   aikido, judo are soft forms relying on stopping or diverting the attack against the attacker usually throws and blocks   not much damage but greater pin chance  weapons are in the weapon listing damage varies on type and strength is added to the die total  parry is not a damage thing you must meet or exceed your opponents attack roll to parry it  sucess = no damage  failure = full damage as normal  fumble = this is going to hurt  area effect = no parry possible DODGE it or eat it

uX50g9Plaa	You can definitely sell a pre owned game.      you might be able to sell it to a shop, not online i mean. because usually, game shops will buy the game off you, then sell it.Depending on the condition of the disc, some stores might not take it.  So Yeah you can sell it. Depending on where you go. You can sell it on ebay. But of course it would have to be less than half price if someones going to buy it.    Just make sure you have everything:- manual, serial number, box and disc.|`|JWjq5iaXaa	you CANNOT sell it at gamestop, but maybe elsewhere?|`|wcB91DUTaa	Yeah you can, but you need to have everything in the disk box (like the menu thingy with the code on back)|`|kr4mg6FKaa	eBay lol

wNHgNPobaa	Get a butter knife and pop the pieces apart. After it's a part, put the whole thing back together according ot color and don't twist it again     There's a code you use to turn it. http://www.wrongway.org/cube/solve.htmlW... describing the solution for the 2nd and 3rd layers, standard cube notation will be used. Here's what you need to know to read it:    F = front face       B = back face       R = right face       L = left face       U = up face       D = down face    In addition to a letter, each move may be accompanied by an apostrophe or the number two:        * A letter by itself means turn that face 90 degrees clockwise (eg. F).      * A letter followed by an apostrophe means turn that face 90 degrees anti-clockwise (eg. F').      * A letter followed by the number 2 means turn that face 180 degrees (direction is irrelevant), (eg. F2).    So R U' L2 is shorthand for "turn the right face 90 degrees clockwise, then turn the up face 90 degrees anti-clockwise, then turn the left face 180 degrees". When thinking whether to turn clockwise/anti-clockwise, imagine that you are looking directly at the particular face you are turning.    For each algorithm, the notation is written with the assumption that the core of the cube remains fixed throughout the whole algorithm, and the faces just turn around it. This means that you also need to know how to position the cube to start the algorithm.     The First Layer    The first layer is solved in two stages:       1. Form the cross     2. Insert the 4 first layer corners (each corner is inserted individually)    I believe that the first layer should be done intuitively. You need to understand it and solve it without learning algorithms. Until you can do this, I wouldn't bother attempting the rest of the cube! So, spend some time playing with the cube and familiarising yourself with how to move the pieces around the cube.    Now, here are some tips to get you started.  Rubik's Cube The Cross    I prefer to start with the white cross because I find white easier to quickly identify on a completely scrambled cube, however, you can use any colour.    There are 4 edge pieces with white (ie. the 4 arms of the cross) which have specific positions. You can't put any white edge piece in an arm of the cross because the other colour on the edge cubie must match up with it's centre on the middle layer.  cross: correct    Here is a pic of what a correctly formed cross looks like (grey denotes cubies that are irrelevant to the cross). Note that the white/red edge cubie matches up with the white centre and the red centre. Ditto re the white/blue cubie.     cross: incorrect    Here's a pic on an incorrectly formed cross. Looking at the white face we do indeed see a white cross, however the white/red edge cubie does not match up with the red centre. Ditto re the white/blue cubie. This is bad!    For a detailed explanation of the cross, check out Dan Harris' Solving the Cross page.  Rubik's Cube The First Layer Corners    Once you have completed the cross, completing the first layer requires inserting each of the 4 corners in separately. The first thing to do is examine your cube and locate all of the top layer edge pieces - they will be sitting in either the first layer or the last layer. Inserting the first layer corners should be done intuitively, not by learning algorithms. To get you started, here's a step-by-step example of one way to insert a first layer corner.    first layer corner: step 1    Step 1    The blue/red/white corner is sitting in the bottom layer (the blue part is facing the bottom so we can't see it in this picture). Turn the blue face 90 degrees anti-clockwise.     first layer corner: step 2    Step 2    Now your cube should look like this. Move the D face 90 degrees anti-clockwise to line up the blue/white edge with the blue/white/red corner.     first layer corner: step 3    Step 3    Now that the blue/white edge and the blue/white/red corner have been lined up, re-form the white cross by turning the blue face 90 degrees clockwise.     first layer corner: step 4    Step 4    Now the blue/white/red corner is in its correct place.    Here are some tips for inserting the top layer corners:        *          Start with a first layer corner that is sitting in the last layer.      *          If there are multiple first layer corners in the last layer (there usually will be), start with one that does not have the white part of the corner on the face opposite the white face. Or, if you were using a different colour for the cross ('colour X'), start with a corner that does not have the 'colour X' part of the corner on the face opposite the 'colour X' face.      *          When working with a first layer corner piece that is in the first layer (but in the wrong first layer corner position), you will need to get it out of the first layer into the last layer, then insert it into the correct first layer corner position. The same principle applies if a first layer corner pi|`|a85b2e371a2478795bd26e46189bcf5eaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsQIoPyfQ...  PART ONE      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW_BBp3FP...

I do not know them all myself, but they can be researched online or by asking someone who knows.     Some basic concepts to think about-start with the middle cube for each side. By simple logic, you can tell that that color will end up being the color for that side (as it cannot be moved). Then solve for the squares directly touching the middle piece, then the corners.|`|gZ6261Ljaa	if you follow the link you can put in the way your rubiks cube looks like and it will show you how to solve it step by step.    try it out:

mTNz8GHGaa	Unfortunately, there is no way to get to Pinnacle Rock without the seahorse's guidance.  Your only option is to restart from Day 1 and get all the eggs again.    If I were you'd I'd have at least three (if not four) Bottles before attempting to get the eggs.  Here are the locations of the six Bottles in the game (and how to get them):    1. Southern Swamp  When you locate Koume in the Woods of Mystery, go and see Kotake at her Potion shop, and she will give you a Bottle of Red Potion.    2. Northern Mountains  After you have beaten Goht and it is spring in the Mountains, go to the Goron Racetrack to race. If you place first, you will receive a Bottle of gold dust, which you can use to re-forge your sword.    3. Romani Ranch  Go to Romani Ranch on Day 1 and talk to Romani. Agree to help her at 2:30 a.m. to help stop alien ghosts from reaching the barn. Fight them off with your arrows and if you win, you will receive a Bottle of milk from Romani.    4. Western Ocean  Go to the Waterfall Rapids on the south end of the beach and race the beavers. If you can finish the race by clearing all the rings in the time limit twice, you will receive a Bottle.    5. Eastern Canyon  Go to the Ikana Graveyard on Day 3 after 6:00 pm and order the Stalchildren to dig up the grave when wearing the Captains Hat. Enter, and guide Damp around very slowly to dig up the mounds on the ground. A Poe will appear if you dig the right mound. Defeat the Poe to get another Bottle.    6. East Clock Town  Go to the Milk Bar on Day 3 after 6:00 p.m. and deliver Kafeis express mail to Madame Aroma. Madame Aroma will be sitting at the bar and will give you a Bottle filled with Chateau Romani when you deliver the mail to her. Chateau Romani makes your magic never run out, until you warp back in time.|`|wgi7fPFaaa	Well after dropping The Fish eggs off at the aquarium, You will have the bottles emptied out. To get to pinnacle Rock you must have the golden Seahorse to lead you through murkey waters. If youve already gotten eggs you most likely know how to get him. ill explain anyway. You go to the pirates hideout, which is located Under water in wooden crates, And take a picture of a pirate, Give it to the seahorse owner and youll obtain the seahorse. Next Swim straight ahead from where you get the seahorse. And you will see a rock with a sign. When you finally get to The Sea Snakes nest. Just go swim by all of them and look inside for a sea snake. If theres a snake in there, kill it and look for the egg inside. Good Luck And if you need further assitance my email is colinboy27@yahoo.com Enjoy your gaming.

Xm5ab6F6aa	well its easy but takes time. i have been repairing dolls for many years now.    I take the heads off and they are put back on with electrical ties. Very easy    Since the bodies are molded you will have to un-stuff them take out the bags of  fillers and all of the stuffing buy new stuffing wash the fabric and rinse very well,  I use a special soap but you can get wool light, the faces and plastic wigs can be dipped as well. the plastic holds the curl very nicely just squeeze the hair in a towel and let drip over a table edge.    When dry restuff the doll with fresh pillow stuffing like what was in the doll. Some times I remove white and brown mold with a heat gun which melts the wax like mold. Do all of the clothes in woollight too and wash by hand and dry on doll hangers, stuff the selves with pillow stuffing so when dry it will hold its form.    The clothes can be ironed or steamed out. restuff the doll using chop sticks. Smooth the hair out and your dolls will once again be in there top glory.     Best of luck and if you have any questions please feel free to email me.

KnDkfBwkaa	The easiest way to tell if the update will work is to read the system requirements of the update. There should be something there that tells you if it will work with a Mac.    If not, as one answer states, look for .pkg (package) extensions. This is a good indicator that it will work in a Mac.|`|sMTVcfiVaa	Sometimes, yeah, but not always. For me, only .package files have worked. Nothing else. It's been a huge pain in the butt.|`|Dso7k3sjaa	Well, as the first person said, the files that are .package files will work.  According to a Help file that's on EA's website, Mac users cannot install cc from their site.  But I've read posts here on this site that say they can, that you just have to download some program and it will make those type of files work.  One of the people who are connected to me on this site knows where to find that program.  I'll star this question so hopefully she will see it and be able to let you know what it is.    But to be honest with you, I would never pay EA for the stuff on their store.  On EA's bbs, someone added up what it would cost if you were to "buy" all that stuff from the store and it is way more than what you would spend if you bought the stuff packs and games that stuff comes in.  But I know that some of the games were never converted into a format that Mac users can install, so that might be the only way you can get it.    I wouldn't try though until you find out if you're even going to be able to get it on your computer.  If my friend can help and there is some program that will work, then try it on their free stuff off of their Exchange before you pay for any stuff from their store -- just to make sure it really will work on your computer.    But I wanted to add that most of the stuff on MTS2 is in the .package format after you get it out of the zip or rar folder that it comes in in the first place.  Only sims and lots are still in the type of installer that EA puts their stuff into.    Here's a link to a tutorial that teaches people how to install cc.  It sounds like it's only talking about PC's but if you read it, it also explains what you need to do if you're on a Mac instead.  Maybe it will help:    http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...
pe7DIYlSaa	ok if you want to learn how to make money in runescape I am your solution!    MERCHANTING!    When i started merchanting I had 2k and in 2 Weeks i got it up to 108k and i loged in only once a day for not even 2 min. how did i do it? i'll tell you:    1) First what you need to do is go to the GE (grand exchange) and purchase as many feathers as you can buy BUT BUY THEM AT LOWEST PRICE ONLY!!!! (curently thats only 5 gp)    2) Log in the next day (or at least 12 hours after you atempted to buy the feathers) and your offer should be made and you will have alot of feathers! YAY!!!!! But now you will have to sell them at 6gp each that gives you 1 gp for every feather...that may not seem like much but once you do it you will realize how much the profit is (ALOT!!!!!!!!!!)    here are some more ways to get some mula:  http://runescape.salmoneus.net/making_mo...|`|iHjt2nWyaa	Botting|`|yHg4rHnfaa	its a scam. your best bet is to get cowhides and tan them.my username is sephjo80 add me|`|0oyzNDGEaa	Quit runescape go to world of warcraft even if u can pay go on a private server runescape is too boring. but a good way to make money there is buy something like armor cheap then sell for higher and mine essence, also u can make bow string. hope i helped :)|`|686VZF91aa	They use auto woodcutters and just chop yews for hours.  Its really just a scam.  With the trade limit they can't do it anymore anyway.  With a 99 woodcutting, you can make money pretty fast.  If you are a member, I'm sure that they cut magic logs which are worth like 1k each.  Also there is fishing.  If you have a 76+ fishing, you can fish sharks which are worth 1.7k each raw.  By the way everything here except for the yews are members.  Oh and there is also fishing swordfish which can be worth a reasonable price.|`|XJlD2kPsaa	Well, they can't exactly do that anymore. Well, they could but it wouldnt be accurate money, they could probably use the wilderness to trade some stuff but it wouldnt be a quick trade anymore. And the majority of the people there probably want to hack your account now since its so hard to trade real money. So, don't try trading money for rs gold. It's a waste of your real money. And how they used to do it was theyd make multiple accounts, log onto like a lot of them at once and start auto wood cutting yews maybe..or fish something for a lot of money at once. Then they would sell all that stuff and then sell you the money. That's why there used to be like 10 lvl 3s selling yews in like world 1 before the grand exchange|`|VkvJJUtxaa	those sites are trying to steal ur money they cant now w/  the trade limit|`|pl6Lsja7aa	HAHA I USE TO PLAY THIS LIKE LAST YEAR AND WHAT I DID IS CUT 400 YEWS A DAY FOR LIKE 4 WEEKS AND YOU GET 4.4M  ORRRRRRRR FIGHT COCKROACH'S CAUSE THEY CAN DROP RUNE SCIMMYS AND RUNE KITES BUT WATCH IT THERE LEVEL 80+ AND THIS IS IF YOUR MEMBER ALL THIS INFORMATION AND IF YOUR NOT MEMBER DO SUM RUNE ESSENCE....

Buy another Machine Revolt structure deck and rebuild this from scratch.     Try focusing on an all machine deck, using the three gadgets to get ancient gear golem and ancient gear gadjitron dragon out. Shrink, book of moon are good, enemy controller is limited to one card.    Limiter removal is your friend, get rid of graceful revival, etc.    Overall, you have plenty of good cards. Finding a theme and finding its ins and outs will really help. Heres a site you might find useful.  http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Ancient_Gea...
OB2JbmFcaa	It's something Massie Block would totally do with the Pretty Committee well, duh, who else who she so it with..lol). Just go through the Clique Series and see what she does in her sleepovers.   These are some of the things I would do:   1. makeovers      2. gossip     3. truth or dare     4. what would you rather?     5. tell scary stories      6. sleeping bag game----> this is where one person goes out of the room and then all the other people switch sleeping bags and you guess who is in which sleeping bag    7. prank call your other friends and then laugh at the end (so, they'll know who it is and don't call strangers because that's rude and they might call the police)    8. do each others hair    9. make friendship bracelets and promise to keep it until next year (that way you'll know who is a true friend)    10. movie (girly chickflicks)    11. karaoke (you don't need a karaoke machine. you can go to youtube, type in your fave songs and when you're typing it, type in karaoke and the tune will come out, and the lyrics will be there, but just the voice won't be so you can sing)    12. mid-night feast----> eat sweets like chocolate, candy, etc.!

RVpl9ZeIaa	Don't be rediculous. The REDMD promotion just STARTED last month. You have until November to subscribe for the 12month issue to get it along with Dandylion.|`|DQyHwIeiaa	it shouldn't be over & i'm not sure when it ends, but you need to order a 12 month subscription for shonen jump & you have to do it in a weird way (call them) & tell them you want 12 copies of red eyes.
Pw1y449Daa	Yeah it does depend on the IV of the Pokemon for the type and power the hidden power is.    The first way to find out the power for hidden power is to fight a kecleon (You can actually hit your own kecleon when in double battles) and use the hidden power on it. The kecleon has an ability called color change or something, where it changes to the type of attack you just put on it. So it should say something like "The wild kecleon changed to grass type!" if you actually do have a grass type hidden power. If you don't get the right kind of hidden power, then you might have to get another mareep and evolve it into a ampharos.    The second way in which i think is the easier way is to use the hidden power calculator, found on some sites (I'll give you a site at the end). All you have to do is just plug in your ampharos's HP, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, and speed into the calculator and it will automatically calculate the type and power of the hidden power.    A third way is to breed a mareep, and then see if any of its stats have these requirements to get grass hidden power:  1. Even Number: HP, attack, special attack      Odd Number: Defense, Special Defense, speed  2. Even Number: Hp, defense, special attack      Odd Number: Attack, special defense  3. Even Number: Hp, special attack      Odd number: attack, defense, special defense, speed  This is all i can think of for now....but im pretty sure there are more combos.  I suggest you to breed some mareeps so you can have a greater range of who has hidden power grass.    Here is the hidden power calculator: http://www.legendarypokemon.net/hiddenpo...    I hope this helps!|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Hidden powers type is dependent upon IV's. Nature is irrelevent.    http://www.serebii.net/games/iv-calcdp.s... This will tell you your pokemons IV's. But you need to know the exact number of ev's you have put into this pokemon after a level up to get a proper reading. If not your numbers will be off. This calculator also shows what hidden power will be. The best way is after you have hatched/caught it immediatley lvl it up to 30 using rare candies and punch this into the calculator. Al ev's will be at 0. Don't save after using rare candies that way you can do repeated tries.    For example if you want grass it's stats at say lvl. 27 with no ev's would have to be around:    74 hp  30 att  34 def  52 spec. att.  37 spec. def.  29 spd    This is where using rare candies help to determine iv's early on.|`|Ek6Wmwk5aa	Regarding to the nature of the Pokemon, they only differ in Stats, not attacks. Because most Pokemons are the same except when it comes to natures.    Regarding to your Ampharos, I think Toxic would be a better choice because it continually decreases your opponent's HP.    I hope this helps.

I have only been to the California one so I will tell you what there is there.

nQga7OYaaa	It makes the game run smoother and loads faster...apart from that i honestly cant see the point.|`|LFWWPgpQaa	1) Faster load times for your games, both when starting and also when loading levels etc in game.    2) Less wear and tear on your DVD drive, one of the most commong faults in the 360 is the drive failing, by copying the game to the drive it will only spin the game up at the very start to check you have it. Other than that no spinning no wear.    3) Noise - The older you 360 the noisier your drive can get - especialy if its failing like mine was, not having it spin stoped my 360 from sounding like an aircraft was taking off while playing games.    All in all if you have the spare HDD space, it wont make anything slower, it has zero downsides, except for the wait when copying to the drive for the first time. Why not do it for your fav games.|`|6wUOnR7Caa	Microsoft did this because some games like oblivion and fallout 3 are kinda slow and they have to load.  but if you install it in your 360 it'll run faster.  WARNING: Dont install online games cause it will lag up the game like halo 3 or cod 4.  WARNING  2: it'll take up space like 6 to 7 Gb|`|jK9yiQq6aa	so you dont need the disk, you can trade it in and still have the game, you can rent a game for five bucks and download it.

Hope this helps!    ~Scottie|`|2dya7YeKaa	Maybe it is just because I remember playing NES games but as far as I am concerned pretty much everything that comes out now has AMAZING graphics.       I agree with other people who say it is probably the color pallette that you find unappealing but it fits with the context of the story.  Your character's appearance is customizable (you basically build your face right at the beginning) and as far as I am concerned that is pretty rad and says a lot about the development that went into the graphics and the engine.    I think it is a great game, I am having a lot of fun with it.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Its not the graphics that are bad, its just the color palette.  But in a game like Fallout, it fits perfectly and is completely atmospheric.  I would definitely give it a shot, its a long and involved game that lets you play however you want (evil vs good) and will definitely be worth your money if you like a game that really sucks you in.

M7G3MZb5aa	-The house edge in blackjack varies based on player skill  -The average blackjack player plays at ~5% disadvantage.  -With ideal strategy, the player will play at   -It is not a 50/50 game, the house advantage comes from the player acting first, all is fair for both player and dealer EXCEPT when the player busts, if the dealer also busts, it is not a push as it would be in a fair game and the house wins.  --------------------------------------...  The house edge resulting from the dealer acting first is rather large at around 7%.  It is negated heavily, by several player beneficial rules, such as.  -Player gets payed 3:2 for blackjacks where the dealer does not  -Player may double down in the middle of a hand  -Player may SPLIT  -Player may surrender    When the player takes advantage of every mathematically ideal opportunity to split/double down/surrender, the house edge will be reduced down to less than 0.5%    Without doubling, and splitting it will be at around 7%    Most players have SOME valid strategy on doubling and splitting so the average player falls at ~5% disadvantage.    To get the house edge as low as possible, you need to use what is known as basic playing strategy, it varies based on the rules and you can get the strategy from this link for whatever game you are playing.....  http://www.blackjackinfo.com/bjbse.php|`|Xo0gWfBAaa	I think i read somewhere that blackjack is the best % game. You have to remember the casino relies on people that don't play perfect blackjack every hand therefore they will have an edge.|`|TyF4iSqwaa	I'm a poker player so I can't break down odds and stats for blackjack like I can for poker.  But the obvious answer to me, would be that the edge for the house comes from having the player act first.  By having the player act first, and hitting, there is probably a slight advantage for the house by having players bust.      .02|`|xDFR5SsGaa	you can have a look over this article  http://www.gamblenext.com/casino-games/6...    it shows what are the payouts at blackjack game and what are the odds of actual winning, the difference between these gives the so called house edge. However as many people don't know when to stop and continue playing untill they lose all their money, the real house edge in these particular cases is up to 100%|`|y822j5h5aa	Blackjack is NOT a 50/50 game.    If you play basic strategy, the house will still have an edge, it depends on how many decks you are playing with.     Here is a link to a table that shows the house edge based on the number of decks being used.     http://www.thedoverpro.com/blackjack/bla...    The House edge also changes based on the rules of the game at the table you are playing at.    Here is a link to a table with the rule variations and their effect on the house edge.     http://www.thedoverpro.com/blackjack/bla...    So as you can see, you need to select the table/game with the fewest decks and the most favorable rules to get the best player odds.     Good luck!|`|AA11522925	Sandynilly sounds spot on, although I think it's -1 to -6%. If you are playing with one deck insurance is a good idea. If you mimic that dealer and draw to 16 you will push the house edge above -6%.|`|F8VMiT4Iaa	Not if you count cards, they don't.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	In blackjack, you go first.  If you bust, you lose.  It doesn't matter if the house busts after you.    There's the advantage.

l6lh6fT8aa	Well...out of all of Magic, I'd say Rorix Bladewing is the best one, but simply out of Alara I would have to pick Hellkite Overlord - a giant 8/8 hasty trampling flier.    Out of Conflux...I actually like the Dragonsoul Knight. While it isn't always a Dragon, I enjoy the fact that you can pump mana into an already decent creature to make it amazing (and a Dragon!).|`|iOAu3o66aa	I don't know anything about the new Conflux set. Dragons rock but, personally the only one I can remeber what it is is Grixis, it's pretty sweet with Vein Drinker and the cards with Death Touch, my favorite out of Grixis is Blightning, it makes my opponents so mad, 3 points of damage and discard 2 cards!?    I believe it's Jund ( Red, Black, Green?) That is my favorite set. The monsters are mean, devouring one another for power, then there's Mycoloth that has Devour 2 and then during your stanby you get a saproling for every +1/+1 counter on him! Then there's Predator Dragon (personally my favorite) He's a 4/4 with Devour 2 Flying and Haste. Devour all those saprolings from mycoloth and finish with one big *** fire ball!!

kzlrcM5waa	Gel pens are finicky.  Most likely, if they've been sitting a while and now don't work, they never will.  I've searched for answers to this one frequently as I love gel pens, but they inevitably stop working long before their ink runs out. I've seen suggestions to run tip under hot water, soak it in alcohol, rub the ball across ones finger, but to be honest these tips have never worked for me.  Recently, I've taken to digging the ink out from the other end and applying it with a paint brush rather than just wasting it by throwing it out.  Perhaps another, wiser person, will answer your question and we'll both benefit.|`|mYp3SSxkaa	The more expensive (ie, not $2 pens) tend not to dry out nearly as much.

jjHUXkgTaa	I worked seasonal while I was in college at GameStop for 3 years. I was asked back for Christmas and Summer help once I completed my first seasonal session. The best thing you can do is to apply when they are looking for seasonal help. If they aren't looking they will just hold your application on file until they need someone.    If they call you and set up an interview, it's just like any other interview. Dress up business casual (collar shirt, Khakis and no sneakers).     I had two interviews, the first was with an assistant manager. They'll ask you about video games and some managers may try to test your knowledge a bit during the interview.    Overall, I wouldn't say it's a difficult job to get... the key is applying around the seasonal help time frame or ask if they are hiring. If you manage to land an interview, just look nice.|`|VD35cqkMaa	Probably not hard. i think its not hard..

Problem (2) correctly indicates that 6 or 8 are equally likely to hit their point, and the chance of rolling either in one roll is 5/36.      Since the chance of rolling a 7 is is 6/36, then your odds are 6 to 5 against winning.

AA11084698	There is usually a save option within the game. Either try pressing 'Start' or try to find a specific area where you are to be at to save.    For example:    In final Fantasy VII, you can only save the game if you are standing on the save portal. Otherwise, there is no way to save the game.    Note: You can always put the game on hold. or shut the PSP off. The game will continue where you left off.|`|JGPq1QJaaa	just save or go to the main menu and click save if that is an option in that game
DX4ftu2Haa	the first size given is the circumference of the needle (us 7)...the 2nd number given (16" long)is the length of the needle|`|pKncxlQLaa	16" is the length of the needle.  A size 15 needle is thicker than a size 7 needle and you'll get larger stitches.  I'm new to knitting and love the circular needles even for making scarves.  I use one that is 24" long for my scarves.|`|154dzJ1Faa	Size refers to the width of the needle.  The world uses metric sizes, but the US uses numbers (which don't mean much at all) so I don't know what a 15 or a 7 is.    You determine the size of the needle by inserting into the holes in a needle gauge. The size of the needle (the width of the needle) is marked on the gauge.  You can also use a micrometre that measures diameters of round objects.    The length of the needle is measured usually from tip to tip.  They can vary... I prefer to use 36 or 4o inch needles.  They are more versatile, and I can do everything with them -- even fingers of gloves!    So you have two different things there: size and length.

kzlrcM5waa	It depends on how detailed and sophisticated you want that fish to look.  For a primitive stamp you can cut up a sponge, or carve a potato, or any other type of firm vegetable or fruit.  If you want a more detailed stamp, you can buy material and tools to carve your own stamp at craft stores, like Michael's or Joanne's ETC.  To be honest, it would be a lot easier to buy a stamp, though.  There's tons of web sites that have many different rubber stamp images available, including www.stampostore.com and www.auntieamy.com.  Have fun!|`|5ec6e061a24d9c036d2640ab0485b48baa	It really does matter what size you want to make the stamp, whether it's just a silhouette or an image with lines, and how detailed it is, etc.    You can make stamps out of *all kinds of things* though, including fairly rough-shaped ones with veggies/etc, or somewhat finer ones by "carving" white erasers or using polymer clay, or up to very fine ones by drawing the image you want on paper then having a stamp made ot it from rubber or clear polymer, etc., etc.    Check out this page at my site for lessons and examples of all of those ways to make your own stamps, and more:  http://glassattic.com/polymer/stamping.h...

I use an x-acto knife to cut out the design and spray adhesive to glue it to the base. They're identical to the store-bought foam stamps (maybe even better because the foam is smoother) and they're quite sturdy, so they can be washed out and reused.  The foam comes in precut shapes and 12x18 sheets (enough to make several stamps).

We used a potato, but you can use any other firm vegetable.  You would carve the shapes into it (remember it has to be the negative of what you want).    You can make longer lasting ones out of lino which you get from the craft store.  You need very sharp special tools to cut away the negative parts, and can create your very own stamp.    If it is just line drawings, you can make a simple one with some firm string.  Cut and glue down the string for the lines and that will work quite well too.    Well, that should get your mind working.  You can make a stamp out of any object at all... as long as you can put ink on it, you can make a stamp!  I've used a crushed can, piece of burlap, scrunched up cloth, rubber erasers, etc.

Or turn off all the lights and play hide-and-seek tag.

You can also play games later at night like this one - Murder:  Prepare slips of paper, enough for each player.  All will be blank except two.   One will be marked "Murderer" and the other "Detective".   Let the players pick, no one can say who they are.  To play, turn out the lights and have everyone mill around.  The Murderer must "strike" one person and they should go down.  This "Victim" cries out and the lights are turned back on.  Everyone then freezes.  The detective then must determine who the killer was by asking questions.  Everyone MUST tell the truth except the Murderer, who may lie as much as they want.    Umm, water fights, or snowball fights (where you fill tights or stockings with flour).    Have pyjama contests. Do America's Top Model.    Definately have cameras handy.

nGYqrKPTaa	Great build (9/10) But I always though dd crow should be sided in tele-dad decks IMO. Only a few minor fixes.      -1 plasma ( it was a good idea at first, but just doesn't go as well with this deck as other cards do )  -2 dd crow ( side in place of kycoo ) in side deck crow>kycoo  -1 gorz maybe ( these decks usually don't have empty field )  -1 plaguespreader ( 1 is fine, but can be used in two's )  -1 scapegoat ( no need for it now )  +1 krebons ( better to run him in three's )  +1 psychic commander ( gets out black rose quick when facing L worn and zombie swarm )  +1 armageddon knight ( dodges ccv and bottomless )  +1 diamond dude ( plenty of regular spells )  +1 e-tele ( speeds it up a bit )  +1 royal oppression ( ss early then stop opponent when this on the field for early field control, or  wait until you have breaker, MST, or heavy to ss all at once for otk. ) And it is being played in a lot of tele-dad decks.    The only changes I see. You could just not add royal oppression to keep it 40 cards. And I know I made more of a net-deck, but I just think that the changes will make the deck faster and more playable w/ less dead draws.      And try this side deck.    Side Deck 15  3x light imprisoning mirror  2x pulling the rug  2x lightning vortex  2x necro gardna  2x DD crow  3x compulsory evac. device bye-bye to other synchros  1x mirror force    And on my deck, do you think that 3 cyber valley 3 macro = overkill?|`|pjdb70Zaaa	Wow. Nice. All I have to say is -1 PSZ +1 Mirror Force.    I see no other changes needed. I believe you've build the Tele-DAD to the ful of its potential. Great job!    Of course there are other variations to a 10/10 tele-dad.|`|rsxmksbsaa	Ditto to what yami yugi said. Only 10/10 IMO.
YlyN73Jnaa	Pass the Balloon, Pass the Key, Soldiers, Horses and Riders, Musical Chairs, Doughnuts and Toothpicks, Ducky Ducky, and more. I provided a link below that has a description of every game. Scroll down to teenagers, as children are at the top. These should be fun party games, but if you don't like any of them then I recommend Twister and Truth or Dare.
40ObXE0caa	Listen man, I'm really sorry, but it's called The Red Ring of Death. It happens because the Internal Fan of the Xbox 360 is to small. It can't cool down all of the circuits. That causes every thing to get cooked and results in The Red Ring of Death. There is no way to fix it. I would not reccomend that you do what it says to do on the videos. You could break it even more. You're only hope really is to buy a new one or call Microsoft. Take it into them and they can try to fix it. But be warned, you're wallet may take a serious impact from that. So, I hope and I'm wishing you the best of luck. I hope you get it fixed. Theres only one thing I have to tell you, even though you don't want to hear it, you might wanna try getting a Wii or PS3 if you decide to buy a new one.|`|zSjiFhD4aa	dude more info! wat the hell r u talking about wat game thing ps3??? or wat? plus im sure ps3 only have 1 lite dude!|`|9cpBO8jCaa	three red lights? what the ****?|`|ex66NqZCaa	Do not fix it yourself, send it to Xbox and they will just send it back if it has been opened and they can tell    You can give it to a friend to fix (if he nos what to do)    Sell for Parts $50-100 dollars    Send to Xbox and pay 100 dollars to get it fixed  (Even if you have a warr. they will still find something to make you pay for)      ITs your choice but unless you got the tools to open it up     Don't do it|`|KKbjc0Xdaa	it all depends you can fix it yourself like i did but u have to go out buy heatsink glue take your xbox apart scrape off the old cheap glue and put the new stuff on it should cost u about 35 dollars altother.
O2hmjOPyaa	There are some sex-toy websites that provide confidential services, meaning that the item/name of the store will not show up on your debit card listing at the end of the month. (Though in that case, you would have a virtually unaccounted for expense on the card.) Still, that is completely based on the website your friend chooses to utilize and may not apply to the one they are wanting to use.     Personally, I think it would be wiser not to let your friend use your card. Besides the risk of embarrassment if your mother found out about the purchase, it is your information that would be at risk on the internet.|`|kIqq7yIAaa	card companies do not show itemized lists of thing you buy using their card  but they do show where you bought the item from   the business name and address so a short drive will tell her all kinds of info  if you have a license you can drive your friend over and wait outside  while they pay cash for it  but do not let them use your card  if they insist beat them over the head with a 2x4 and leave the bloody wreck on their doorstep  then burn the board in your fireplace to remove the evidence

fvre0o9laa	Seams were made for thousands of years with hand sewing... basic hand sewing manual here:  http://vintagesewing.info/19th.html    Otherwise, it sounds like you may just need a simple straight stitch sewing machine -- you can often pick up a 1950's straight stitcher in a cabinet for $5-25 at thrift stores or garage sales.    Otherwise:  http://www.cet.com/~pennys/faq/smfaq.htm    What I want for beginners in sewing:    - a machine that doesn't scare you  - a machine that isn't balky (cheap new machines are often very    balky or need adjustments often and are rarely repairable --    just too frustrating to learn on!)  - very good straight stitch  - good zigzag (4-5 mm is fine, more than that is gravy)  - a method of making buttonholes that makes sense to you  - adjustable presser foot pressure (which helps some fabric    handling issues)  - accessory presser feet that don't cost an arm and a leg    (machines that use a "short shank foot" typically handle    generic presser feet pretty well.  Some brands of machines use    proprietary or very expensive presser feet)    If the budget stretches far enough:    - blindhem and stretch blindhem stitches  - triple zigzag (nice for elastic applications)  - a couple of decorative stitches (you won't use them nearly as    much as you think)  - electronic machine because of the needle position control and    because the stepper motors give you full "punching force" at    slow sewing speeds -- mechanical machines often will stall at    slow speeds.      Please go to the best sewing machine dealers around and ask them  to show you some machines in your price range, *especially* used  machines you can afford. You'll get a far better machine buying  used than new, and a good dealer is worth their weight in sewing  machine needles when you get a machine problem -- often they can  talk you through the problem over the phone. While you're trying  things out, try a couple of machines (sewing only, not combo  sewing-embroidery) over your price limit, just so you can see  what the difference in stitch quality and ease of use might be.  You may find you want to go for the used Cadillac. Or you might  want the new basic Chevy. Might as well try both out.    Suggested reading: John Giordano's The Sewing Machine Book  (especially for used machines), Carol Ahles' Fine Machine Sewing  (especially the first and last few chapters) and Gale Grigg  Hazen's Owner's Guide to Sewing Machines, Sergers and Knitting  Machines. All of these are likely to be available at your public  library.    Used brands I'd particularly look for: Elna, Bernina,  Viking/Husqvarna, Pfaff, Singer (pre 1970), Juki, Toyota    New "bargain brand" I'd probably pick, if new was my choice:  Janome (who also does Kenmore).|`|6N3yjlXhaa	Visit as many sewing machine dealers as you can.    Tell them what type of sewing you want to do.    They will help you choose the right machine.    If the new machines are too expensive, ask about trade-ins.    Most dealers have lessons and classes.    Buy the machine you like best, from the dealer you like best.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	I am also a sewing beginner, and just bought my first sewing machine last week.  I would highly recommend this machine to you.  I saw it has a lot of good comments online so i went into Walmart and get it myself, it is surprising cheap ($80) so i was a little skeptical at the beginning, but it work just wonderfully.  It is easy to thread, and most importantly the instruction manual is so easy to read (it also include a free demo DVD), I LOVE this machine and would recommend it to anyone who just want a decent machine to sew simple stitches and do not have a whole lot of money to spend.|`|sMWV1pFaaa	I've just begun sewing on a machine also and I have a Kenmore. My mother used it for a few years before me so it's pretty reliable and will last you years, not to mention easy to work.|`|056cd57fe1506567da3828f5884632ecaa	Singer Prelude is awesome! It is pretty much all you need for a beginner sewing machine, pretty easy to use, and not too expensive either!

That one is fun as well.  I would recommend both of them.

Peach is kidnapped in near every Mario game.  The purpose of each one is to defeat Bowser so you can save her.  So it is actually Zelda who is rarely captured.|`|27cd00537a4c79f450c26015e47d2f6baa	Princess Peach.  She's annoying but she doesn't get kidnapped nearly as much as Zelda does...every time you turn around, she gets caught by the bad guy...     I think Zelda could take Peach in a fight though....just saying.|`|vjww5cN7aa	Zelda.    I play SSBB (super smash bros brawl). Since I've mastered both characters, I could probably kill anyone with either.    I personally think Zelda and her other side "Sheik" are more powerful.

Personally, this may offend you/or others, but if we had taken care of the situation at the time, we wouldn't be where we are now.  Same goes for crimes in the US- let the punishment fit the crime, and crime goes away. Another subject for when I am president...LOL!    I personally think President Obama was the right choice for us now.  With the "oil cartel" out of office, perhaps we will use the resources we have. Google this USGS Report  http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp... and see if we might be headed in the right direction.  The other side of the coin is... the unknown.

Make her the active sim, right click on her again and choose "set to birthday." Now click normally on her and choose "grow up." Make one of your other sims your active sim and right click on the townie girl and choose "make unselectable", this should make her no longer appear as a controllable sim. Now just hit shift, ctrl and C again and enter "boolprop testingcheatsenabled false" to turn the boolprop cheat off. Don't mess around with any options while bool prop is turned on unless you know what you're doing because its a pretty powerful cheat and can change a lot of stuff around if you hit the wrong option.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Without cheating, you will need the Sims 2 Free Time Expansion Pack in order to do this.

The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.    There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.    Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network.

VY7dlcx7aa	I would love a plush of him or his yami, lol.  Unfortunately they never really released an official plush in the US of him but I can't say about Japan... anyway, your best bet is to probably commission someone to make one (you can find great plush makers on deviantart or just look up "Yugioh" custom plush- there's this one girl who's awesome but I can't remember her site name- sorry XP).  Custom plush usually look great, but they can cost around $30 to 75 dollars depending on the maker and difficulty of the plush.    If you're at all willing to try I'd suggest making one- my one friend owns every anime plush ever made (she loves them, lol) so I made her a custom Death the Kid plush from Soul Eater using the patterns on these sites-    BODY:http://members.shaw.ca/plushie/ufoplush/    HEAD: http://ashfantastic.deviantart.com/art/N...    HANDS:http://ashfantastic.deviantart.com/art/C...    CLOTHES:http://ashfantastic.deviantart.com/art/P...    (FYI, These are all patterns meant for beginners).  I had a lot of fun making a plush- It was suprisingly easy and I really liked how it looked in the end.  I used a special type of paper that I bought at Hobby Lobby for the face- it was a little expensive, but worth it- I can't remember the name of the brand, but basically you get the face you want (the eyes, ect) on a picture and then you use your inkjet printer to print it onto the paper, which you can then iron onto the doll.  (NOTE- Don't do what I did- be sure to iron the face on BEFORE sewing the head- it wrinkled a bit XP).    Best of luck whatever you chose!  (Ryou is teh cuteness!).  ^.^    EDIT: Here's a chibi Marik plush someone made- http://vegetathealmighty.deviantart.com/...    And this girl on deviantart accepts commissions but she's not cheap (>sigh  http://setsunakou.deviantart.com/art/Thi...

HVKfuhp3aa	I'd say yes. You get extra slots of classes and think how much that will come in handy at 10th Prestige with 5 extra slots. I also find it kind of fun to start over "from the beginning" again.   I hate how you can't get weapon skins now. :/|`|VWO9tW5eaa	only if you get really bored|`|XCZKwQlnaa	it depends, i my self am not 65 yet, but i heard bad things about it. but if you play for a while at 65 and it gets broing then you mite as well.|`|rIFqv8nvaa	No, i stopped playing because all my guns were gone.|`|5TYsbhhEaa	whats prestige mode?|`|wNDGK29gaa	It is somewhat worht it. If you think 5 classes are not enough for making weapons then you should go prestige all the way to 10 so you could have 10 classes. Also it would show that you have a high rank than others but it isnt much of a deal. I would just rather stay in a prestige and keep all my weapons. Going Prestige just changes your symbol and gets a extra class for prestige 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10.

CMhdNPPxaa	First, consider the choices.    Fallout 3 is completely open world.  I bought Far Cry 2, and did not like it at all.  That's the reason I never bought Fallout.  I kept it for the multiplayer, but Fallout is only 1 person.    Halo Wars isn't out yet.  It looks like a great game, but it has just been announced today as a finished game.  It still has to go through manufacturing, and if you want a game now, this isn't a choice.    Resident Evil 5 is an Arcade/Horror Survival game.  I am used to First Person Shooters, and I naturally do not like Horror or games where you move as slow as you do in the game.    In the end, it's up to you.  Consider what you feel.  Official Game Reviews can be great for footage, but I find them unreliable as the people's common interest.    Also, it shouldn't make much difference whether it is used or not.  The condition of the game should be playable no matter what.    (PS Sorry for rambling on!)|`|uXQcDsiAaa	Halo Wars. so u can play with friends.

This game will entertain you till you could buy more games...100hours thats insane!!!|`|iyk9o7UJaa	H A L O      W A R Z|`|TkNv5hGTaa	Get Killzone 2 it makes all those games look so last year. Resident Evil is not for everyone and if your looking for muliplayer Killzone 2 beats them all easily. Its like Call of Duty, but with a much more intense, cinematic feel to it. Halo War is a strategy game so thats an easy no. Fallout 3 is overhyped because its on PC, and all consoles, except Wii. Its good story, but you'll have much more fun with any other RPG like Oblivion. Killzone 2 is the best out of the bunch.

Two: The PS3 does get hard drive problems and sometimes it can crash.    Three: The Wii gets sensor problems sometimes.    Four: Wii Games have great games for kids but not adults which stinks.    Ok.|`|YsSWT9G0aa	Wii has a lot of fun casual games, such as Super Smash Brothers. Brawl, Mario Kart Wii, LoZ: Twilight Princess, and Super Mario Galaxy. Although Wii's online is unfortunetly laggy and today's gaming tends to rely on it.    Xbox 360, In my opinion is the overall best, It has tons of good games, good servers and is rarely laggy depending on your connection and the game.    PS3.. I.. well hmm.. Theres not really that many exclusives that I would consider. LittleBigPlanet is one, MGS4 is great as well, but other than that.

nQga7OYaaa	Get a pikachu from Viridian Forest, its the only electric type you'll come across for a long time!  For a fire type....you'll have to wait till later on in the game to get an Arcanine or Vulpix.   As for grass types...i've always found these to be pretty much usless aslong as you have a strong electric type, so i'd suggest replacing that with something else. But if your still interested in getting a good grass type then wait till you get to Cerulean City and you can get either a Oddish or a Bellsprout.  And by the way, i strongly recommend getting a Dugtrio from inside digglets cave when you get entry to there, they have incredibly high levels!  Good luck.|`|HF19QRo8aa	Squirtle was my starter Pokemon when I played blue.  So I was vulnerable to electric and grass.

So it doesn't matter if you use a rusty dagger or a glass warhammer, you still get the same amount of xp....so more hits equals more xp.|`|oihouY7Naa	You gain a level in Oblivion by working out on your main skills. Like Magic, strength, agility etc...|`|hyCw0Qyaaa	i dont know if the difficulty has anything to do with it. but im pretty sure for the dammage or how many hits.  the difficulty is really just for people who eaither want to play easy or harder.|`|T26KdRXJaa	To gain xp you must use your main skills over and over until the bar advances all the way acroos and you gain a point in that skill.  With spells you must use them on yourself or hit an enemy, spamming is good for easy xp, but kind of boring (spamming is running around casting heal or something on yourself to get xp).    Difficulty has no impact on xp, just the difficulty. Also, if you want to level up, do some of those naggy fetch quests and run around the countryside.  Don't fast travel, run. Kill everything that won't get you arrested, using the spells, or weapon type that you want to get better in. hope this helps. Let me know if you need more info.

AA12042448	For what age?  Is it for the high-schoolers?  If so, a sponge toss is always fun.  It gets a little messy (only water) but is fun.  Get several buckets and even more sponges -- the big fat kind you'd wash a car with.  Cut the sponges in half.  Line the buckets up, put water in them, and let your contestants toss wet sponges into the various buckets.    If it's for all ages, do a fish pond for the little kids.  You put up a screen of some kind and decorate it to look like a lake or a pond.  Someone stands out front to give the kids the fishing poles, each of which has a clothes pin on the end of a string attached to it.  The kid throwns the clothespin over the screen, where another person clips a prize to the clothespin and gently tugs on the line.  The kids pull out their line and think they caught the prize.|`|PXWVGQyAaa	Bean bag toss.|`|vMXk9ohSaa	How about a balloon walk?  Fill up some medium or large size balloons with helium (rent a little tank and bring it along to blow up more).  Each person has to walk down a path and back again with a balloon held between their knees (no holding with hands).  If they make it there and back, they win a prize.  (Time it first to see how fast it can be done and put a time limit like one minute.)  Or, you could make contests with 3-4 people each time and the first one back wins.

6GIrW5eWaa	Is this the mission where at the very end you go through a series of tunnels after following a tank to the entry point? If so you might have missed one of the soldiers that you were suppose to kill in the tunnels. There are a couple of series of tunnels that you can go up, left side, right side there is a chance that the AI's didn't kill of them. There is also at the very end one enemy to the right of the cave opening, there is a Big Gun on the left side and a platform on the right side on the platform is possibley a final enemy. Keep trying, although you are not the first person I have heard to have this glitch.

Here are examples of Pokemon Sprites:  http://arkeis.com/pokemonsprites.htm|`|QlAj0Braaa	You can make pokemon but you can't put them in the game unless you are a huge hacker.

If this is the first world you've been to after Traverse Town, then you can either go to Wonderland or Deep Jungle. If this is the second world you've been to after Traverse Town then you either go to Wonderland or Deep Jungle (if you completed Wonderland then go to Deep Jungle & if you completed Deep Jungle then go to Wonderland). If this is the third world you've been to after Traverses Town then go to Traverse Town again to continue the story of the game (only do this if you've already beaten Wonderland and Deep Jungle). That should help you out! ;)|`|3yvyEmKOaa	It's been a while since i played one but i think you enter the tournament and fight Cloud. To go on to Tarzan's world you have to beat the Trickmaster in Wonderland too so try there if cloud doesn't work. (P.S.- Talk to Phil to enter the fights and if all this doesn't help, check out Jiminy's Journal; it helps A LOT)|`|vtJDHJDYaa	Land in the First District to begin the next adventure right here in Traverse Town! There isn't anything new in the Item Shop yet, but purchase some Potions or Ethers if you are running low. Remember to sell any extra Arts items for quick cash. There isn't anything new in the Accessory Shop either, but buy some if you think you need to.    To the left of the Accessory Shop in the alley that you started in at the beginning of the game is a Red Trinity Mark. Use this to enter a closed off section of the Alleyway. The chest here contains DALMATIANS 4, 5, and 6. Return back to the First District.    Enter the Second District and fight the Heartless here. Once they are cleared out, head towards the Dalmatians' House and enter. If you've been collecting all the puppies so far, you should have 27 by now, which is enough to get you a FIRAGA-G. Head through the rest of the Dalmatians' House to reach the Alleyway.    Make waste of all of the enemies in the Alleyway, and then head over to the grate that the water is pouring through. You will notice that there is a Red Trinity Mark right by the gate. Use it to open up the door to the Secret Waterway. Swimming forward, you'll find Aerith and Leon. Keep talking to Leon until he suggests you see Cid. He will also hand over the EARTHSHINE GEM. We will use this in a second. Things will be easier if we return to Cid first. Before you go, check the stairs behind Leon and Aerith. There is a chest at the base containing DALMATIANS 10, 11, and 12. Exit the way you came in.    Back in the Alleyway, enter the Dalmatians' House to get another prize. This time it's a THUNDARA-G. Sweet. Exit back to the Second District and head back to the Accessory Shop. Cid will install your Navigation Gummi in exchange for a favor. He wants you to deliver an OLD BOOK to Merlin. You will suddenly hear the bell at the Gizmo Shop ring. Strange. First things first though. We have to deliver the book and complete Merlin's favor. Head back to Merlin's Study either by the Third District, or riding the platform at the top of the stairs in the Secret Waterway. If you opt to take the path through the Third District, you will encounter a new enemy.    Once you are in the Magician's Study, talk to Merlin. After the conversation, give the Fairy Godmother your Earthshine to gain the power to summon SIMBA. You can test out the summon by having Merlin bring you up to the training area. You may be curious about that book in the corner... well, we'll leave it alone for now.There isn't much you can do with it for now.    Head back to the Third District to find a familiar face. Once you are done chit-chatting, head up the stairs near the entrance to the Second District and enter the lit up house here. Inside the Small House, talk to Cid. After talking about stuff, he hands over a WARP-G, a very helpful Gummi indeed. You won't have to manually fly to worlds that you've been to before.    After the chat, head back to the Second District and enter the Gizmo Shop. After fighting off the enemies, exit through the other door and climb the ladder to the roof. Defeat the enemies here, and then use the Red Trinity Mark on the wall. Pull the rope inside three times to reveal the keyhole to Traverse Town. Sweet! Unfortunately, when you jump down, a familiar nemesis appears. It's Guard Armor again! Level 21 is a fair level to be at for this fight. Remember to equip as many abilities as possible, and to fill up everyone's item slots. Also, equip Cure on a shortcut button of your choice.    The battle starts out simple enough, but when you cause some damage, Guard Armor will suddenly transform into a different boss. Opposite Armor! After the fight, you will learn the AERO spell. Excellent. After sealing the keyhole, you will get another NAVI-G PIECE. Excellent again.    Return to the First District and talk to Cid for a COMET-G. He will also open up a Gummi shop, and if you want to buy something, buy a COM. LV2. This allows you use more Gummi Blocks in construction. If you enter the Accessory Shop now, there is a scene with Pinocchio. This isn't quite necessary, but it gives you some information on later events. If you were curious about the Old Book you gave to Merlin, you should go there now. Examine the book to enter a new world.

Q7N6EX8Zaa	Use plain old Elmer's glue. This is a water soluble glue and will wash out taking the glue and the sequins off. Just one note :it will not be as durable as the other permanent glues , but if its only for one use ... go for it.|`|vMXk9ohSaa	It may seem like a lot of trouble, but you could sew them on just like the handmade professional clothing.  (Expensive)  Use some tiny beads the same color as the sequins.  Knot the thread, pull the needle thru from the back, then insert thru sequin, then thru a bead and back thru the sequin again and back thru the fabric to the back.  You will just have to clip the thread from the inside and they will all come off - no glue residue or anything.|`|mYp3SSxkaa	Well, a fabric glue will hold the sequins on, but those glues are not water soluble and so the sequins won't come off - at least not without leaving glue behind on the pants. Sewing them on by hand will take a while but they will come off really easily when you're done.    If you still don't want to sew the sequins on, but an inexpensive pair of trousers in the same basic style and fit to glue the sequins to so you don't ruin your pants.|`|0WASp0bHaa	You won't be able to glue them on and still be able to take them off later without ruining the pants. You will need to sew them on.|`|DXQxU3B2aa	Buy double faced tape. Cut it to the size of the sequins even if it isn't perfect. Stick one side on the sequin first, then put the other on the fabric.

Also, VAC (Valve's anti-cheat system) issues delayed bans (to allow as many people to use the same hacks before bans are issued and the hacks are marked "detected" - think fishing net instead of rod), many months after the hacks were actually used. Just because the account is "in good standing" doesn't mean it isn't queued up for a ban.
GcXPibIaaa	Hello there,             I've been the owner of a m3 DS for about half a year now,   and I'm completely impressed by it. Like you, at first I had only heard of the r4, but after doing some research, I believe it is inferior to the m3 real. You see, With an optional ram pack that fits in the gba slot of your DS, you can emulate GBA games. Besides this, the m3 DS comes with "Moonshell" Thought it is not addressed as this on the menu, if you read the description you can see that it is moonshell. Moonshell, if you didn't know, is an amazing media player that supports  a variety of formats.                    As for where to buy, I strongly suggest www.echostore.com  I stumbled upon it google-ing "Where to buy m3 real" I've purchased 3 products from their site (Each one a m3 real, two I bought for my friends for them) They've got Great prices and quick shipping. If they don't look safe to you, you could go to dealextreme.com, they have that kind of stuff.                       Thank you, and I hope I've helped.|`|06203f607d17651cfb71b250c8ef20aaaa	you can check google for each of those products to see what the compatibilities are for those cards. some of them you can flash the firmware or software version to ensure compatibility for more games.
DfPyyDssaa	You receive one as a gift from Bernie Crane after completing all of his missions.   Furthermore, it is believed that your first exposure to the Infernus is after you complete all of Bernie's missions. But if you compete in Brucie's races early on, it is likely that you will see at least one of them. You can kill the driver and steal it but you will cancel the race and your favor with Brucie will go down. In GTA IV Multiplayer it can be seen driving around the streets of Liberty City. Stevie will send you a message that he requires an Infernus to be delivered in his garage. If you find it, don't get in yet. Wait for one of the Infernus cars to appear. If you're lucky, you'll see one of them driving around, giving you a chance to steal it and store it in your safe house.|`|R7x0qIqyaa	Just drive around the middle island, with luck you'll find one.|`|jUEoujN2aa	hahaha who cares man it's just a lambo. when i got it i flipped it in like 30 seconds. you know how you steal them cars for brucie? you'll probably end up stealinga  lambo (take it to your house instead of brucie) and idk maybe when you complete all them missions you can buy cars.|`|dx2Dj9AWaa	you can find em around the city..you just have to keep lookin' around|`|3tYt8aF8aa	If you haven't finished the Stevie's text message cars there is one there,just beat it up enough so he doesn't want it,but don't catch it on fire  Or wait for one to show up on the street|`|COFPXYvZaa	no. there's no cheat codes for it and there's no specific spawn points for them. you can either keep driving around in vain hope that they'll appear, OR, you can call brucie for a race, go to the race starting point (but DON'T actually enter the marker to begin the race) and there's a chance the lambo (or any other sports cars) are there. if there is, then just go up to it and hijack it. if there isn't, just repeat this process until you find one.

It's only 15 bucks.|`|uBzXAJYBaa	well it depends on if you use game cards or if you pay monthly .  if you use game cards just go buy another one and add it to you subscription.  if you pay monthly then just make another payment and poof your back on wow  just like that.

0af7c8af45c772ad750996038c21d9daaa	Yes, you can start doing Monster Carnival. You can go there by talking to Spiegelmann who is found at Kerning City, Orbis, Ludibrium...    To go to Ludibrium, you need to go to Orbis first, then when you arrive, buy another ticket that takes you from Orbis to Ludibrium.    There's a second route but it's long. After you go to Orbis, head to Orbis Tower and go all the way down (it's 20 floors). In the last floor you'll see two doors, one will take you outside to El Nath and the other will take you to the basement. Head to the basement and keep going down til you reach the water. Then walk all the way to the right until you reach Korean Folk Town. There you'll see a huge book, press Up and continue going up to Helios Tower. Finally, you'll see an elevator. Wait until the door is open then go in. You'll be at Ludibrium then.    You don't need to go there if you want to do Monster Carnival. You can do it from Kerning City or Orbis too.    You can't change your haircut using mesos. You need Nexon Cash for this. If you have Nexon Cash, buy a haircut ticket from the Cash Shop. If can't pay real money to get Nexon Cash, you can still get it through Maple Trade System. Sell items there to get some Nexon Cash.
m0dzMbQYaa	it doesnt work , you lose everything and even if there was a glitch it wouldnt last long, dont even bother with it|`|joa30mM8aa	even if you can, they'll fix it|`|z6GVKxBIaa	The flamethrower is rubbish anyway.

efc4fad286ec4bab1cc38b7a839701ccaa	first of all, jagex says "never to give out any of your information to anyone even people claming to be a mod0." ignore him and contiue on with w/e. no one can do that stuff unless you have given it to someone.    relax have a good time. :D|`|uj3TpkW6aa	holy **** it only a game  not even, its a gay game|`|ifNqPNCVaa	A mod would NEVER EVER ask you for you bank pin. He would already have access to that information.    He doesn't have the power to ban you permanently either, its your own choice, and since hes not a mod it doesn't matter.    I suggest you just ignore him, and change your password. Possibly even report him to a real mod.     Play safe :)|`|2SxBqNd2aa	Change your password!|`|k87nUDFtaa	don't tell him, it's easy to find those out. he's the one prboaly hacking your file, and he wants the pin so he can get into your bank. he knows the other stuff because he has already been on your file or seen you most likely.|`|AA10771653	whats the big deal if its just fake.  but still no i wouldn't|`|hNRPQWqBaa	don't give it to him.  a real mod wouldn't threaten to ban you for not giving him the bank pin.  i would try writing to jagex to see if they can sort it out:)|`|SRK8pJ0Qaa	umm runescape is lame, i used to play it. play wow. and dont give him your pin. bankers of any dont ask for your pin ever unless you are actually at the bank, and this is only in real life obviously
hNRPQWqBaa	lol the real issue is finding a d party in a unpopulated world, so there would be less people to steal the booty XP    i suggest hanging out in the german/french servers.  i've gotten a saradomin plate body from randomly going to d partys there.  have fun!
AA10486365	The NXE isnt installed on the HDD its installed in the core system, you would have to connect to Live and upgrade.    Or you can go here and upgrade it through a cd/dvd:  http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/system...
TgtmqsEzaa	Duel Master cards were very popular a year ago and at that time you could find them at every local toy shop. But now there are very few places left which actually sell duel master cards. I suggest you checkout Clown Town or any other reputed Toy store............  ........i wish i could have been of more help|`|nPE7lYATaa	he he he he kiddo........still playin duel master.............aaahh neva mind i used ta be a beyblade fan couple of centuries ago....mmmm try any big shop u will get it
uPalPUjYaa	Only thing I can think of that's anything like switching views is just pulling left trigger to aim, but I'm sure you've figured that one out.  Otherwise, as far as i know, you can't change the camera angle.  You could try looking through the options where they have the screen brightness and control settings and stuff, but again I'm sure you've already looked there.  I've never really had a problem with how it is normally.
a2ZUE0U5aa	No. The price will stay the same until the next machine comes out. The only reason the xbox price droped is because it was so closely priced to the playstaiton 3. The playstaiton3 is such a superior machine to the xbox. If I were you I would move to the ps3 unless you want to play halo3 then get the xbox. But if you want to have linux (basically a full blown computer) on your ps3 and be able to rip bluerays onto the network. Also free online game play. (xbox live = $49/year). The ps3 has wifi connection to your home internet. Also If you have a home server it can see them and play movies over the wifi network. I have a home server with over 2,000 movies on it and when I have friends who want to watch a movie I just fire up the ps3 and let them choose one.       Sorry for the large spill. But ya the price will stay the same for at least another year or so.|`|AA10426969	No, it's like 200 right now, and probably not until PS3 really starts to catch up.|`|qXg3idqXaa	probably, but only when they make a lot of new systems...|`|wGUQqZrVaa	no cheapest i have seen them was 169.99 at game-stop used,although i would highly recommend you get at least the arcade"199.99"new because i have went through 4 xbox 360's  i had bought refurbished.and all 4 broke and im extremely gentle with my game systems i even turn them off every hour or so to let them cool  down.after those 4 i still for some reason didn't give up i went and bought the arcade new at walmart and "knock on wood"it's living up to its expectations. i would recommend investing in a 20g hard-drive later down the road|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Yes.  I think the premium can take another 20 to 50 buck price drop this year.  MS is supposed to start using cheaper chips to help lower the cost of making 360s.|`|3QWqBvHqaa	I think it is about as low as it will ever get.    For gaming news, reviews, previews, discussions and much more check out http://www.notinthere.com/|`|uj3TpkW6aa	no sorry  it deff would of went lower buy now they have been out for a while|`|AwEspXiiaa	Actually it costs $200 dollars new.|`|ujTlIn8Saa	ps3 is lowering their prices soon so xbox will be down 50 $ soon like in a month or 2
AA10426969	Allright, here's a quick history lesson.    STep 1: Pacman takes over the hearts and minds of millions  Step 2: Atari Becomes popular with it's 2600 series system, and releases it's 7800 series  Step 3: Atari became complacent, relying more on market strategy than good games.   The worst example of this is the old E.T. game. This game was despicably bad, youtube a video of it or something.    Either way, Atari hyped the game up to an already aggravated consumer base, and proceeded to sell a steaming pile of crap to people.    In the end Atari had to hide thousands of copies of the game in area 51.    Step 4: People stopped buying Video Games until a certain plumber came along. Quality of gaming was down, as was selection.  --------------------------------------...    A lot of people think that the Wii is in danger of doing the same thing.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Basically, Atari owned the video game business (Colecovision was a competitor, but it was no match for Atari) during the 80s, and Atari didn't do anything but put out crappy games after crappy games.  All Atari did was put out a bunch of inferior games and expected gamers to buy the game because they had no other option.  Eventually, it bit Atari in the behind, and people just stopped buying video games.      Atari also introduced the 5200 and 7800, but they were just upgraded 2600 with better graphics.  The games were still the same, but with better graphics.      The crash happened because there were no new innovations.  It's the same games.
OYfJ9klHaa	of course it'll work  thats  how all of them are|`|PEGZmw73aa	204$ for it o-o    Wow, but anyways it will work.    It's a Sony labled product and it's magic gate.    Most Scan Disks work for PSPs as well.    As of early 2008, Mark 2-certified versions of the Memory Stick PRO Duo became available. The Mark 2 designation indicates the Memory Stick is suitable for use with AVCHD recording products or other faster Memory Stick enabled devices by providing appropriate minimum write performance.      Hope that helps.
r3JPM866aa	My favorite is:    MP40 - Extra Ammo  Frag and Tabun grenades    - Bouncing Betty  - Stopping Power  - Matrydom    You can change the third perk, because everyone is always expecting matrydom so you don't get many kills with it, but I use it anyway :P    When I'm Sniping:    Springfield - Sniper Scope    - Same perks and grenades as above. I like the grenades, but I think the perks should be changed. I'm only lvl 38, so I don't have all the perks or weapons.    I average about a 1.5:1 kill/death ratio when using the MP40 at places like Asylum and Courtyard, and 2.5:1 when sniping at places like Cliffside and Castle (But those are just on my good days :D). I might switch my sniping from Springfield to M1 Garand once I can put a scope on it. I'd probably still use the Springfield in open maps like Cliffside and use the M1 on smaller maps like Castle.    P.S. - I play on the Wii, so I don't know anything about capture the flag or search and destroy. Plus, we don't have the maps, Roundhouse or Airfield, so I don't about them.|`|xgui1LAFaa	cod5 sucks, either play cod4 and own or wait for cod6: modern warfare 2 !|`|ujTlIn8Saa	i always get shot in the back so whip out the camoflauge and use the mp40 up until the stg then use the fg42 up until the ppsh and just try to play headquarters and search. use matyrdom because that pisses people of and use bandolier or satchel charges and ur good to go|`|k87nUDFtaa	type 100 is the greatest gun with box magazine, bandolier, stopping power and steady am/extreme conditioning.|`|UzV0jc2haa	COD WAW HAS NO GUNS SO NO ONE KNOWS WHATS BETTER FOR YOU|`|z6GVKxBIaa	Dont listen to these people. They have no idea what they are talking about.    Only gun you need. MP40 Dual magazine  perk 1 ( Bomb squad)  perk 2 ( Juggernuat) Stopping power isnt needed the MP40 is so powerful  perk 3 (Steady Aim)     O yeah come on . hit me with the comments like Juggernuat is for Bad kids and stuff. All the pros on gamebattles use it and if you wanna succeed in this game you better learn quick matey. And i am on gamebattles :-)
nQga7OYaaa	Get a strong fire type, Ninetales maybe or wait for Moltres.  Dragon types would be useful...or a good Psychic type like Drowzee or Alakazam.|`|kqyANOfsaa	make sure they are high level and know the weakness of the elite four because knowledge is power and have a lot of power ups  and health  ups|`|qbmkMWqeaa	I'd pick up a fire type, Nintales...|`|bh6FLi6taa	You're fine just take a lot of revives they sell them in the store just before the elite
CZJwBpW2aa	Well there have been many rumours going around about release of new Call of duty: World At War Nazi Zombie maps, but the only offical annoucment is that Treyarch (game producers) have said that there will be downloads for cod5 throughout the year. The rumours going around are based on the new maps for the PC version called subway and Cafe, these are unofficial downloads made by people who dont work for Call of duty so thats why they arent on the XBOX360 or PS3    I hope i helped you.|`|SBcxooLsaa	i nebver hearfd anything about new maps|`|gK4gIepZaa	yeah they are coming out  i dont know when though, but they will come
RLy1LTsOaa	You end up owning all of Stillwater, and then you take down Ultor in the epilogue.  There is also a secret mission where you kill Julius.
LnYr2dLfaa	It's called a Pity Final Smash (as said in another answer) and you get them when you are losing by 4-5 or more lives (most common in matches with 20 lives or more).|`|k87nUDFtaa	mercy smash ball, it's when a player is down so much that they just give him the final smash is he can do something|`|Lgf2ARppaa	every 5 deths the person gets a mercy smash ball|`|uctxzjIIaa	It's called a Pity Final Smash. You get them sometimes randomly when you die and are getting blown out.
3OGqz3Uyaa	Not really. Some people's computer freeze (like mine) in the middle of games and we have no choice but to end the game. Especially during the mini games.    So don't be immature. Some people really can't help but to quit early.
