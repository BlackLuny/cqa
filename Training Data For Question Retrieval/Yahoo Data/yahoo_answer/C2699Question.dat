20070818140353AArArWG	Pets;Dogs	HELP! My dog is acting weird for no apparent reason.?	We adopted a 5 month red healer mix about 4 weeks ago.  She is sweet, affectionate, outgoing, great with our two toddlers, has NEVER pee'd or pooped in the house.  She sleeps in her kennel at night without complaining and is always happy in the morning.  She goes outside, does her business and comes back in.  She has never pee'd or pooped in there either.  UNTIL YESTERDAY.  Thursday night she went in her kennel and all was well.  Friday morning (yesterday) she stayed in the back of her kennel and didn't want to come out.  When I finally coaxed her out she didn't want to go outside.  I had to pick her up and put her out.  She is nervous, seemingly afraid of something. She nipped at my husband when he bathed her this morning after she pooped in her kennel again. When I tried to pet her she ran away. We got her back into her kennel, and she pooped again.  Is any of this sounding familiar to anyone? I've called my vet but haven't heard from him yet. PLEASE HELP!
20070831122453AAsz38a	Pets;Other - Pets	Do you place the same value on your pet as you do a family member or child?	I ask this because yesterday I took my dog to the pet park to play. I noticed conversations were similar to conversations people have about their small children. Also there seemed to be the same level of pride and defensiveness. People were only wanting to talk about their pets and seemed disinterested when someone would begin talking about their own. It was very interesting to watch. I noticed it in myself also. Someone asked  "How old?" and I assumed they were asking about my pet! LOL

20081013232112AAEsZkh	Pets;Cats	How often should I bathe my cat and how should I bathe him?	My cat, Bowie, is just a normal domestic cat. He is a very clean cat and he is also and indoors cat but we have started letting him outside  a bit only supervised. Like today I was hanging my washing so I let him outside for a while and he went absolutely mental scrubbing around burying himself in dirt and rolling in I have no idea what. Being a proper feral. We let him out at least four or five days of the week for short periods of time and he always does this but I have never bathed him because it is a nightmare. Today I thought it was just to much so I filled the bath just enough to get him wet and used a towel to get him in the and just got him wet all over then I took him out (well he managed to escape by his self) towel dried him and let him clean himself (he's been at it for about 40 minutes now, very clean little critter).      So is it necessary to do this every now and then? Its summer now is it a bad idea getting him stressed like this in the hot weather or is it good because he has a bit of a thick coat that needs to come off. Bathing techniques what do you do to stop you from ending up in hospital?

20081012105256AATdJ1D	Pets;Birds	? about bare eyed cockatoo bird?	Hi! I visited a bare eyed cockatoo last night to purchase from his owner. I would like to get him but I am worried about his health. He is abut 15-20 years old. The house he was in was filth! They had him in a dog crate.  One side of the house had been boarded up at a doorway. I almost did not go in until I saw the owner come out of the house for viewing and she looked safe. While in the house my husband thought he smelled mold in the house. It was a very old house and musty, and somewhat smelled of cigarette smoke which is what I thought I smelled. Not sure what mold smells like or can you smell it? Anyway the bird was SUPER sweet and immediately got on my shoulder and put his head near my neck to cuddle as if to say please help me. He he was making some soft noises. I was not sure if he was sniffling or if he is sick or if these birds make that type of soft sound when they are happy? She stated she was taking him to the vet for a check tomorrow and a beak trim (it was very long).    If there is mold in the house, how would this affect the bird's health in the long run? Are there any other signs I could look for to insure it is healthy? I can tell that he would make a great pet and want to help him! Any advice would be great! Thanks!

20081013220809AAySmXT	Pets;Cats	I used fronline but my kitten still has fleas?	i have 1 cat and 3 kittens, i bought the 6 month frontline so i can use one for each and then another after a month. i used frontline about a week ago and i still see all of them scratching and i checked one of my kittens and he still had fleas all over him. how come frontline didn't work? maybe the fleas are in my carpets? but still doesn't frontline kill every flea that jumps on him instantly? i don't get it i put it on all 3 of my cats but still all of them are scratching. i wasted $100 for a ripoff?!
20081016084940AAmmXPQ	Pets;Cats	Nothing works on the fleas!?	Both of my cats get frontline once a month. Recently, I discovered they had fleas(which had never happened before) so about a week after i put on the frontline I took them in for flea baths. Two days later, I reapplied frontline. It's been about two weeks and they still have fleas. What can I do?
20081016082741AAIH8nG	Pets;Cats	Please give me suggestions for this cat!?	Ok, here's the situation; There is this female cat that lives outside of my house, I live in the country and I think somebody dumped her off over there because she is very friendly and I've been feeding her. I am allergic to cats so i can't have one in my house. The problem is that she is pregnant, her stomach is really big and I don't know what to do. I feel really bad for her because she lives outside and it's about to start getting really cold. My friend told me that at this spay and neuter place they perform cat abortions then spay them after that, but I don't know if that's the right thing to do? Even if I take her there and do it, I know that she will need time and space to recover and I don't think she can do that very well outside. The nights are already very cold at night here and I don't want her to die. Do you think that her and the kittens would be fine if I just left her alone and didn't do anything? Thanks in advance for any suggestions. 
20081018173649AAwN1mP	Pets;Cats	My cat started pooping on the carpet and peeing in the corners! Always used his litter box before.Help! ?	We have a crawling baby, and I know that cat may do smth because he lacks my attention, etc. or stressed. Could there be some other reason? I'm scared, what's going on with him?

20081018174147AAPbHS8	Pets;Cats	My cat is peeing blood again?	my cat has been having this problem since the beginning of this yr. i first noticed blood spots all over my room so i took her to the vet. they ran a urine sample there was some bacteria so they put her on a wk of antibiotics. she seemed fine after but then like two months later i noticed it again, took her to the vet and they did a urine test and other test for things like kidney problems or diabeties...came back she had some bacteria but no other problems with organs so they put her on two wks of antibiotics. then about 3 months later happened again took her to the vet. they sent a urine test to a special lab (idk just ment for me i had to pay more) came back that nothing was wrong, no bacteria nothing. the vet asked me questions like have i changed her litter?food?environment? i hadnt changed anything cuz she is sensitive. she seemed fine for awhile more. she is 6yrs and black long haired cat and is overweight so i put her on a diet but she seems to be taking it well. i do have a hard time keeping her bottom clean because she has so much hair, she gets really big sores that i know hurt her and i feel bad. i started cleaning her bottom everyday and always keep her litter clean the vet saw it and said it was cuz she was irritating it.  it seemed to work for about 4months but just recently she started urinating light blood.i am almost forsure it is not bacteria related some reason stress probably but i dont know what could b causing it she is very spoiled!am i missing something that would cause her to be stressed? i dont want to take her to the vet again to many antibiotics and they never seem to keep the problem away and honestly i dont have the money to. i have spent over 1500 in the past 9 months on the vet and everything comes back normal. the urinating all over everything is frustrating me and my grandparents whom i live with. they r getting very upset and want me to put her down, they love her to and they dont want her to suffer and there very oldschool. how do i help her or what other reason might be the cause of her peeing blood?

20081018182814AAf8nwd	Pets;Cats	My female cat has another UTI, is there any home remedy that will help her?	My female cat went to the vet two weeks ago, bc she was tinkling everywhere and there was a bit of blood in it. The vet gave me Clavamox to give her for 10 days.  Well as most people who try to give cats medication, I think I got 6-7 days of the medication in her.  She has just started tinkling everywhere again, and I just noticed blood.  I just gave her another dose of the medication and I maybe have two more doses before I am out.  I am going to call the vet on Monday and see if I can get another bottle of the medication, but is there anything that I can give my cat that is a home remedy that will help her with the uncomfort?  Thanks for your help!

20081027215549AAm0uN2	Pets;Dogs	Does anyone else think it's cruel to get a new puppy just because your other dog is old?	I quite often hear of people getting a new puppy, while they already have a dog, but they get a new companion because their other dog is old, or "near the end".      I think this is just awful. Do people not think an animal can't tell when it's being replaced?    I recently rescued two ferrets from a family (who were not caring for them at all), and they told me they were selling them so they could buy a new Pomeranian puppy because their Labrador was probably going to die soon. I couldn't believe they just said it like that.       Does anyone else feel that this is cruel, and people should mourn the loss of their pet before getting a new one. Not getting a replacement before they're even passed away!      Opinions?
20090108021802AAOqVBr	Pets;Other - Pets	Urgentissime !!!!!!!! cherche véto caprin........!?	message re?u aujourd'hui   recherche véto dans le Sud de la France   (j'ai donné le tél de mes deux vétos, mais l'opération est délicate et pas commune - l'anesthésie l'est aussi (délicate) pour les caprins)      Pour tous les amis des animaux.      Très grande urgence.       "Notre petit bouc ''Bambi'' a une tumeur maligne sur la machoire      inférieure.      De jour en jour, elle se développe, mais aucun véto dans le Var ne      veut tenter une opération.      Il ne peut plus s'alimenter à cause de cette grosseur.      Nous lui coupons du foin et il grignote un peu dans nos mains.      Nous allons être obligés de  l'endormir si nous ne trouvons pas une solution au plus vite.      Ses yeux, sont comme deux étoiles qui me fixent.      Comment endormir un animal qui continue à courir, et se comporte      Normalement, sous prétexte qu'en 2009 il n'y ait pas un véto capable de le sauver?       Certains reconna?tront peut être Bambi, vu les nombreuses émissions télé que nous avons faites.      Il a fait rire des milliers de téléspectateurs de 30 Millions d'Amis par ses  facéties.      Il vit à la maison, est plus intelligent qu'un chien, je peux vous l'assurer.       Et à ce jour nous sommes plus que perdus.      Il ne lui reste peut-être qu'une semaine avant l'ultime décision.      Il ne me quitte pas, se colle contre moi, comme s'il sentait  notre future séparation et réclame mes calins plus que jamais.      Lui aussi doit se douter ..............      Alors par pitié, si vous connaissez un véto pour caprins qui pourrait      envisager un  traitement ou opération, dites le nous.      Bambi est tout pour moi,       ci-joint 1 photo tel que vous l'avez peut-être vu ... et Bambi ce jour (machoire déformée).

20081028063708AACq1kB	Pets;Dogs	Dog afraid of the rain and cold?	I'm living in Philadelphia, so not the worst weather conditions, but not great, and it just started to rain and get cold. My dog--a pit mix, we think-- has incredibly short fur and refuses to go out in the rain and shivers afterwards.   Yet he has to go out to go bathroom. I've never had a dog with such short fur, so I've never had this problem before, and I can't tell how much of it is being frightened and how much is legitimately being cold, but I'm sure it's a good combination of both.    Currently, we've been getting him out with a treat which we give him once he's complete the trip and gone to the bathroom. But we can't do this the entire fall/winter and the treat doesn't keep him from being cold, it just motivates him to push through the cold. I'm sure there's someone out there with a dog with equally poor protection from the cold (other pit mixes, greyhounds, whippets, boxers, etc.) who lives in a colder place, so my question to you is how have you dealt with it? As much as we're against dogs wearing clothes, that's the only thing we can think of to keep him warm and dry, so please let me know if you have any other suggestions and also how you feel about the clothing idea?

"morally unjustifiable" breeding practices lead to disability, deformity and disease among show dogs.       "There is compelling scientific evidence that the health and welfare of hundreds of thousands of pedigree dogs is seriously compromised as a result,"       "From a dog health and welfare perspective, such shows are fundamentally flawed and do our much-loved pedigree dogs no favours.

My cat is a 14 year old male, we've taken him to the vet several times, and he got some kind of steroid that we need to give him every night. The first day thereafter he didn't have a bowel movement once. The second day, he went a little (twice, I believe). Today, he went about 5 times, once or twice splattering it all over... He is still affectionate, maintains an appetite, and is very active (especially for an old cat). I am also concerned because I woke up with a little bit of IT (I know disgusting) on my t-shirt (apparently he sits on my back when I'm sleeping? Don't really know, cats are weird). Any advice is greatly appreciated.

20090305045218AAhb3U7	Pets;Dogs	Renting and doggy smell?	I am about to rent and also rehome a short haired bull terrier mix dog. The landlord is okay with me having a pet but is mostly concerned about the doggy smell houses often get. I said I would put the dog outside during the day after I take it for exercise in the morning and then allow it in one room at night. I was hoping it could be my room or the kitchen because I know bull terriers need company.    I plan on getting up, taking her for about 1/2 an hour walk, then into the kennel outside, a break at lunch and a little walk from a hired person and then when I get home some fun on the beach. When it was time for my bedtime (say 10pm) I would let her inside once she's clean and dry into the designated room.       If I confine her to one room will that reduce the odour she produces or will it still spread around the house?      P.S. I wont accept the house if they don't allow the room allowance! The dog is more important to me. It would be cruel to leave it outside all the time without company.

20090305045841AAoGl67	Pets;Dogs	Can I complain to someone about this dog?!?	Hi!      I stay in a big street and there are lots of dogs and I have nothing against them but there's one that's driving me around the bend! It stays a couple of rows away from me and it's owner just opens the door and lets it out to walk itself, they don't go with it. Well it chases my cats, fights with my dog, jumps at my kids (all under 5) and frightens them. This morning it was chasing a kitten and it knocked my one year old right off her feet. It's a great big dog and she was terrified. I think it's really irresponsible they just let it run riot. I don't wanna go knockin on doors as I am unsure of exactly which house it belongs to, but I just wondered if there was someone I could complain to about it? I think it'll hurt someone (or a poor kitty!) at some point and I'm tired of it. Maybe if someone official had a word in their ear they'd walk it properly like most responsible dog owners.       Any ideas what I can do? =)

20090305041247AAzUMJk	Pets;Cats	Any suggestions for me?	My 6 year old cat recently started pooping on my bed again. She uses the litter box to urinate fine, but will later defecate on my sheets.      Right before it began she would start to poop in the box, then get frightened and run off sometimes trailing or smearing it on the floor and my bed. So I think now she just might be afraid to poop in it for some reason. Yesterday she used it for the first time in days and I praised her, but today once again she is crapping on my bed. lol      I'm not sure what to do anymore!   I got a new litterbox   She's healthy as can be   There's nothing new in her life.. no new cats, people, furniture or anything   I went on a 2 week vacation in January but she used the box fine for a while after I got back so I don't think she's mad, but who knows

I have a water bottle for my two guinea pigs, I've been changing it every day to fresh water and been filling it up to the exact same mark on the bottle (I marked it with a marker).  None of this water has gone down even a mm for roughly a week now.  They're getting plenty of excercise, vitamin C, fresh veg, food, straw, and are getting cleaned out twice a week.  They seem ok in themselves, no crusty eyes or anything.  Why aren't they drinking?

Yesterday my boyfriend let both cats into our bedroom before he went to work as the 'boys' like to come in and stay with me till I get up,but yesterday my new cat weed on the bed.Straight away I took him to his litter tray(always clean)I thought it was just an accident till my boyfriend came home from work and he weed on the sofa!I cant figure out why he is doing this,he certainly is happy and we both treat the both of them equally.I remembered last night that the previous owner of my new cat said he had weed one on hr bed but he has been so clean up until yesterday.Both cats have their own litter trays in the same place.Can anyone help?I think the new cat was going to do it again this morning but I took him to the litter tray straight away and after a few minutes he used it.What can I do?Thank you? :-)

20090305044920AA4SrLH	Pets;Birds	My ring neck dove is dying and I don't know what is wrong with him!?	I got my ring neck dove, Teek, 4 years back with a wild dove we named Hickory. They were mates until one day my little sister accidentally let them out of the cage while my ceiling fan was on and Hickory died four days after she hit the fan. Teek was depressed but he pulled through and a year later my little sister got a white female, to be Teeks mate, for her birthday. Even though she was the one to kill MY dove. But Camille, the new dove's name, had a condition that she could only lay soft eggs. But Teek and her got along perfectly and she was his new mate. well a little over 4 months ago Camille got really sick and died. quickly. It is now 4 months later and Teek was doing great until i noticed this morning he was lying on the bottom of his cage and shaking. I brought his water to the bottom of the cage and he hastily drank it down, but then stopped suddenly and started having what i can only describe as a seizure. His head started flailing around and he did a couple rolls and his head was shaking but then it just stopped. And he seemed okay. Then the same thing happened when he tried to drink again. and then when i tried to put him on one of his poles i found out he no longer had any kind of balance. He no longer coos or really moves at all. he just sits there. I love Teek more then anything and I don't want to see him die but my father doesn't want to take him to a vet because he said it would cost too much. I don't know what to do.

20090305045907AAYZKlU	Pets;Reptiles	Please help my 9 week old bearded dragon stay alive. He seems very sick and lethargic. Can't seem to open eyes?	I brought my son a BD for his birthday. I did all the research before purchasing and definately knew more than the pet shop where we got him. I had a custom enclosure made (35.5" long, 23.5" high and 23.5" wide. It houses 2 75 watt basking lights down one end, one for day and one for night. I use a reptisun 5 18 watt long globe that covers the length of enclosure for UV light and have it on a timer from 7am till 8pm. The tempreture of the enclosure is around 30 degrees with the basking heat higher at around 35.  At night I turn the temp down to 18 degrees with a black night light for heat. He is feed on small crickets which i dust with reptical calcium and vitamin D3 and green leaves, carrot and yellow squash. He's been with us now for 2 weeks and was a little docile when we got him but then after a few days perked up and we all fell head over heels in love with him. He has now gone down hill for the last 3 days and i'm worried we will loose him. I took him to a vet and they didn't seem to think it was all that bad since he had had a few crickets that morning. he is still eating a little of the leaves as well but he is extremely lethargic and having trouble keeping his eyes opened. He has also starting to dig in the corner of the enclosure and curl up and sleep all day. I was told that dessert blend was ok for substrate as its digestable but have since read that it isnt so i will take it out and place paper towel down. He has done poo every day which seems normal consistancy so i didn't think it was a blockage but today was the first day he didn't pass a motion. Our family has became very attached to this little guy and dont want to loose him. Oh i forgot to mention that i spray him once/twice a day and give a bath every second day, i also drop water onto his nose and i've never really seen him lick it off. I have done so much research on BD and dont seem to know whats wrong. The pet shop know nothing and our so called reptile vet didn't even pick him up and just printed off a care sheet that i've already read many times over the net. So i feel i'm on my own. Can anyone help. I've bought a dropper to administer some vegie based baby food blended with some green leaves to give to him if he's stoped eating completely but dont want to stress him out by force feeding him. Please, please can anyone shed some light or maybe tell me that this can happen and with alot of TLC he will get back to normal??   I read on one of the blogs that there is this lady that's great with reptiles from a zoo. Does anyone know her contact details?   Thankyou in advance.

I did all that I was told to do for my 40 gallon tank. And I was told to treat them for ick. so I did they died like I said one by one. Then I washed the tank and decided to try again. I got four beutiful fan tail fish two have died the first just died, the second looked awful but I treated it for ick, but it didn't help it was missing tail and just died now another one is looking bad and I'm still treating the aqua. but it's not helping. I love to watch my fish and so do my grand children they name them and they feel so bad when they die and so do I. Can you help.
