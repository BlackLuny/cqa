As part of my requirements for graduation, I have to job shadow someone in the medical industry for 8 hours. I called on animal hospital and they told me they weren't accepting and shadowers.      My teacher recommended another hospital, but when I called and got directed to the project coordinator, she wasn't there so I left a message. I called a few days later after getting no response, but there still wasn't anyone answering so I left another message. It's been two days, and I need someone to shadow before the end of this week.      What should I do? Do I call again and leave another message? Should I wait for a response? I already called twice. Am I being too pushy? Or should I start looking somewhere else?
20090219170450AAd7ZWD	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Public toilet etiquette?	Here's the deal:      You're busting to drop a nasty turd, so you go into the public restrooms and notice that there is only one other person in there. You notice that it's very quiet and she's taking her time to leave. Eventually, she gets up and goes to wash her hands, but of course she has to take the time to brush her hair reapply makeup etc.       If she is in there, she will hear everything. Do you just ignore her and go about with your business, or do you wait until she leaves? At which point do you just let loose?

I was scared and having dealt with my brothers murder years before, i could not suffer the worry of not knowing where she was. can anyone see or understand why i did this? i did't like her sleeping with him, but it was better than wondering if she was dead. idk. i just get the feeling people think this was very wrong of me. thanks everyone who uses intelligence instead of ignorance.

I am very shy @ school and when meeting new people. I admit im am not super pretty and i dont have the highest self-esteem. Howver, i feel I am a nice person and can be fun when you get to know me. In high school I have always been the loner. Like in class when it's time to pick partners, I am always that one who doesn't have anyone to go to. When people ask what I did over the weekend, i will even lie and say i hung out with some of my "friends". I also have never had a boyfriend. Like im never that one that boys look at and flirt with.      I don't get how the really outgoing, pretty girls who can be mean have all of the friends, and how ppl like me don't. I hate only talking to like 2 people. Sometimes i worry about my future. As an adult, will i have friends to hang out with? Will i ever get asked out and date to eventually find my soul mate?      ahhh......... thanks for any words.........

Please help!!!?	k here's the situation:      i am a lesbian, but i only came to terms with it a couple of months ago. my best friend, lucie, is a very devout christian. she goes to church every sunday, spends 2 hrs on sunday after church with her youth group and always wears her cross.       she's a great person, but i have no idea how she views gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgenders. some groups of christians have very strong anti-homosexual views, and i don't know if she belongs to one of those groups. She tells her mum everything, so her mum has a very clear picture of what i am like. Her mum and dad are very strong christians as well.       one time at school, there was this 'scare' in which they thought i was involved with Wicca (which i wasn't), and they nearly took lucie out of school. i don't want to loose her as a friend, i don't have that many!      i have absolutely no romantic feelings towards her or any of my other friends, but i'm always scared to loose them, and always a little over-protective (but in a non-sexual way) towards them. I don't know if she'd believe me if i told her i had no feelings for her, other than friendship.      another factor is, i don't want the whole school to know. i have GCSE's coming up, and i plan to take the most difficult course available (3 sciences, all have 3 lots of 6 exams at the end of the year with all the other exams, so 18 extra exams to revise for), and i don't need any more trouble at school other than being the school 'larry' (loner).      plz help!

Everyone has a fear, but I'm only 16!! Why do I feel like this! I think about death and growing up and everyone I love dying too. It's something I think about all the time and everyday. You have no idea. I want to think of something else. Something a teen can think about. So I do not have to feel like this. I feel 80!      I even thought of suicide to end the pain of growing up and losing the ones I love. The thought of all of it is to hard. I do not want to commit suicide (I would never). I am not a fan of giving up.       Graduation. Getting 18 (an adult) and getting out of the house you can not be dependant on your parents anymore you have to be independant now going off to college getting your own job and home and not being able to do the old things you could do when living with your parents. Like asking your parents for permission to do this or that or asking them for money or having your mother take care of you when you are sick. No...I would have to take charge of MYSELF. Dealing with my loved ones deaths. Turning 40. Getting older than that and being to old to be, to be a kid again and have fun. Then your not attractive anymore and then your looking around and seeing all the young people live their young lives and being young to do all the fun stuff like dating(while I am knitting In my rocking chair) I would not be dating because I will not be attractive anymore and guys these generation want really young women.       Alzhiemers. That could be my biggest fear. :(...........................   I am terrified of getting old. I know that It Is going to happen.....soon   Does anyone else get worried?   Or Is It only just me? :-/

I understand the domicile issue with VALIC, but the company is a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG and as such the company itself is subject to creditors.  Would this not mean VALIC clients may be there, but assets could be controlled in receivership with the State of Texas should failure occur..and..if VALIC sells, the new company will have to find ways to pay for the company...either getting rid of agents, running off business to collect surrender charges (very common with insurance takeovers) or find legal remedies to increase fees and definitely pay lower interest rates which are legal under current contracts.  Am I not right on this.  Thanks!

20090203113410AAb1VfJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Abortion Clinic Bombings?	I believe they are wrong, but I understand the reasoning behind the actions of those who do them.       People who bomb abortion clinics and assassinate abortion doctors, believe they are defending the unborn from being murdered by who they believe are murderers. In order to reason this way, one must believe that an unborn life is completely equal to a life that is born.      So my questions are only for those who believe an unborn life is completely equal to a born life.      1) If the government gave mothers the right to murder their born children under the age of 18, with a doctors assistance, would you stand by and let them do it?       OR      2) Would you forcibly intervene as vigilantes and physically prevent it from happening. Would you kill the doctors and mothers in order to prevent the murder of children?      If you answered yes to question number 2, why aren't you bombing abortion clinics and assassinating doctors right now? Why would you only do that for born children if you believe that the life of the unborn is completely equal to the born? Don't the unborn deserve the protection of vigilantes too?

Amongst the companions Abu Bakr is viewed as the most superior on account of his closeness to the Holy Prophet (saaws). If this is indeed the case then why did the Holy Prophet (saaws) not select him to be his brother when he (saaws) divided the companions in to pairs on the Day of Brotherhood? Rather, the Prophet (saaws) chose Hadhrath Ali (as) saying "You are my brother in this world and the next", so on what basis is  Abu Bakr closer?

It is all down to sensory deprivation, you can induce hell and heaven experiences using the drug ketamine.  When all sensory input is taken away you feel alone trapped and in a total hell like place.  The same thing happens during death and massive amounts of a drug called DMT are released into the brain.  I have experienced this and discredit any experiences people have had of heaven or hell.

There is no way to explain where the stuff before the Big Bang other then Creationism.

Not all the time, obviously, but I noticed they usually are, especially when it comes to a woman's size. Black and Latino men are much more accepting (even loving) towards thicker women than White guys. I guess this is why you often see bigger White girls with Black or Latin men.   Anyhoo, size put aside, White men just seem to be generally way more of sticklers for "hot women" than other men. Could this be because of the way stereotypically "Pretty White girls" (i.e. Jessica Simpson, Paris Hilton etc)? Do White men get brainwashed by this and think all women should look like this?

I worked in another town about 10 miles away, where there is a sort of scummy scottish accent, for only 3 months, and during that time my accent had changed to a scummier one, now it's back to being posh.

I dont want to lose his wife as my friend, I dont know WHAT to do?      Dont suggest I tell his wife, she isnt someone who would take this well, and then I would lose a friend.  WHY do men have to do these things? I am not a flirtatious person, I dont do anything that would make them think I am interested or available !

Someone says something that doesn't make sense, or what they've said just catches you completely of guard. OR... when people meet eachother for the first time and don't know what to talk about. OR... early in a relationship when you're not sure how to act, if you should even make physical contact with he person, or what to say when that happens or to even say anything at all! I guess it might be a personality/ conversational conflict. And awkward situations make their way into movies and shows, we all know its funny because we've been there before! Thoughts....?

20090220112831AAJ3EC8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Honest question for Jews about an old teaching?	I just read an interesting tidbit:  In the second century BC, Ben Sirah taught that Wisdom was not just an abstract principle but a member of the Divine Assembly with female attributes.    She was the divine spirit hovering over the ocean at the beginning of the creation process, among other appearances. I thought that was interesting because my understanding of the Judaism of the time was that it was overwhelmingly dominated by the masculine.      Is that teaching accepted by modern Jewish sects?  Is there any personification of various divine attributes?

Do you really think this and that we wouldn't care because we though that there was no God?   I think that is completely insane and idiotic.    We don't kill ourselves, because that's what we know is right, and not by religion, but by human instincts.   It's just like asking why don't monkeys kill each other; they don't believe in god, it's just in their instincts. If a species just killed each other as they pleased, the species would soon go extinct or be barely surviving.       What do you think?

(Hosea 9:16)      Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.  (Hosea 13:16)      Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. (Numbers 31:15-17)      Thus saith the LORD of hosts ... Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ***.  (1 Samuel 15:2-3)      Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.  (Psalms 137:9)      Their infants also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives raped. (Isaiah 13:16)      Their bows will strike down the young men; they will have no mercy on infants nor will they look with compassion on children. (Isaiah 13:18)            That's just a few of them.        So is god a hypocrite, or are his followers hypocrites?

But when the woman acknowledged her level of being no more than a dog compared to the superior Israelites, he agreed to help her!

I have been using a Hebrew, Egyptian, King James and American Biblical Dictionaries to try assist in understanding the scripture, however given its many translations, I would hate my ignorance of the 'language' to form a misguided decision towards whether or not I will embrace Christianity,      So my question is, are they any resources you would recommend in order to gain a better understand of the wording and structure of the Bible?      Thanks in Advance,      David
20090220142800AAVupVh	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do you think the Satanic Bible has only 1 enemy... Jesus?	Why do you think the "most evil religion" that is known to exist.. "SATANISM" say nothing hateful toward buddhists, muhammad, hinduism, the pope, scientology, etc.?       Why does "satanism" have only 1 enemy that is extremely hated & constantly bombarded in their bible happen to be... JESUS?      My guess is.. cause there's only one truth...   and the most evil religion knows that there's   only 1 truth... hence, the reason for the hatred   pointed at the only one who saves & redeems.

20090220112927AAt5mjN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people ask "How can God send his children to Hell? There is no God!"?	Why is it that people often reject God by saying if God exists, he wouldn't send his children to Hell??      Well, I think this is the answer. God has no children in Hell. The ones that are in Hell are the devil's children. They are sinners and unbelievers who chose devil over Gods.      If they don't believe in God, how can they be God's children??       So you can either choose God to be your father and spend time with him in heaven or choose devil and share his fate in Hell. Would that make sense??

I know nothing about this, and I was just curious.

Do you ever feel burdened and oppressed by your Atheism? Do you feel a sense of loss and guilt, even pain?      Do you ever wish that someone could show you the way to a better life?

Many of you say that the reason I have never felt your God's presence is because my heart is not open to him, or because I'm not seeking him.        However, you also liken him to a loving parent.      I have been through some very trying times over the last two years.  My parents did not wait for me to seek them.  They came to me because they knew I needed them and because they knew I was too weak and hurt to even ask for help.      Why wouldn't God do the same?

I am in a little hot water with the Flight Attendant's union for telling several female flight attendants to "pipe down" on a recent Kingston to Kansas City flight.  I was tired of hearing them run-off at the mouths about how "fun kareoke (sp??) was at the Holiday Inn last night!!!"        I quoted Corinthians to them, beseeching them to stay their mouths in the name of airline safety.  As a pilot, I have a plane to fly.  I don't have time to listen to a bunch of glorified waitresses running their mouths.  My job is hard enough as it is.  Hearing the incessant braying of females just makes me lose my concentration.      Was I out of line?      God Bless you-      Captain Art Griego
20090220121510AAf93Vv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this why atheists, pagans, etc don't like us Christians?	They look at us, and see how we are.  They notice that we don't do many of the things they do, like go to parties and get drunk, steal from our neighbors, have promiscuous sex, and cheat on our significant others.  This makes them feel bad about themselves, but at the same time, they feel as if they are being scolded.  The light that is our righteousness casts light upon their misdeeds, and it makes them uncomfortable, like walking into a well lit room after being in the dark for a long time.

20090220090341AAo1xiL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are you an atheist who just can't seem to muster faith in God?	Why don't you just try to enter your prayer closet & humbly ask the invisible God: If you are my heavenly Father and the Son, Jesus, the Savior of the world, please show me. Let me know personally.      Then, even though your heart is still separate from Gods heart, your guardian Angels are near you. They will alert you to any sign God will give you. The Kingdom of God is near every one of us.      So, since you probably haven't tried this, why be afraid to try. What could you lose?

20090219181421AAAsaEf	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Do you believe that it's wrong to feel as though you're better than someone based on your heritage?	First of all, I am just trying to gather opinions. Secondly, I am Italian.      Did my people not achieve more than any other subcategory of the human species (homosapien)?  Were we not the conquerors of the known world? Do we not still to this day continue to influence the most powerful governments to exist? Think about it, any government based 90% off of Rome is powerful? Look at America, based so much off of Rome, and it stands the most powerful nation on earth. Did we not produce the greatest, scientists, artists, poets and mathematicians etc etc. Do we not have the most beautiful women, and most handsome of men? It's true that Italian men are known for their handsomeness. Italian women for their beauty. Are we not the most Romantic of all the different subcategories? Do we not produce the greatest quality of cars, music, food and drink? Perhaps the greatest man in history, Gaius Julius Caesar, is an ancestors to the Italians. I mean, if we have a man of Gaius Julius Caesar's greatness as our ancestors, are we not to be proud? Do we not have reason to boast?

20090220121307AA3ZFHq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do you know if you need to change churches?	I gave my life to Jesus 3 years ago in April and have been going to the same church ever since. I became involved in youth ministry 2 years ago by being a leader at a kids extreme group that meets every Wednesday. I know going to church isn't all about making friends and such, but I just feel like an outcast. It's been three years and the church is relatively small, but I really haven't gotten a chance to get to know anyone. I am always friendly and smile and greet everyone I see but sometimes get no response. Also, a couple of weeks ago I was invited by the Pastors wife to attend a Bible study on Sunday mornings before church and I was very excited. So, I got 3 of my 5 children ready and left early Sunday to make it. Well when I showed up, she didn't even greet me, so I went to her and asked if this was the bible study. She said yes but it never started and she explained to me that she would call me later on that night about it. I never got a call. I'm lost on what to do, and would love to have some christian friends. Is this selfish of me? Am I over-reacting?

I'm going to Tanzania soon where 35% of the population is Muslim, and it's said to bring a head scarf, even if your not Muslim. You don't have to wear it all the time but it's good to bring one anyways. But then, I'm going to Vancouver next week, and I'm going to be on the train for three days, so I can't get into my hotel right away to shower so I was thinking of bringing my head scarf to wear to cover my hear (it will be all messy and greesy after three days).

And don't say he'll do these things the second time he comes.          * Isaiah 1:26: "And I will restore your judges as at first and your counsellors as in the beginning; afterwards you shall be called City of Righteousness, Faithful City." Some Jews interpret this to mean that the Sanhedrin will be re-established. (Isaiah 1:26)       * Once he is King, leaders of other nations will look to him for guidance. (Isaiah 2:4)       * The whole world will worship the One God of Israel (Isaiah 2:11-17)       * He will be descended from King David (Isaiah 11:1) via Solomon (1 Chronicles 22:8-10, 2 Chronicles 7:18)       * The Moshiach will be a man of this world, an observant Jew with "fear of God" (Isaiah 11:2)       * He will come from Bethlehem (Micah 5:2)       * Evil and tyranny will not be able to stand before his leadership (Isaiah 11:4)       * Knowledge of God will fill the world (Isaiah 11:9)       * He will include and attract people from all cultures and nations (Isaiah 11:10)       * All Israelites will be returned to their homeland (Isaiah 11:12)       * Death will be swallowed up forever (Isaiah 25:8)       * There will be no more hunger or illness, and death will cease (Isaiah 25:8)       * All of the dead will rise again (Isaiah 26:19)       * The Jewish people will experience eternal joy and gladness (Isaiah 51:11)       * He will be a messenger of peace (Isaiah 52:7)       * Nations will recognize the wrongs they did to Israel (Isaiah 52:13-53:5)       * The peoples of the world will turn to the Jews for spiritual guidance (Zechariah 8:23)       * The ruined cities of Israel will be restored (Ezekiel 16:55)       * Weapons of war will be destroyed (Ezekiel 39:9)       * The Temple will be rebuilt resuming many of the suspended mitzvot (Ezekiel 40)       * Jews will know the Torah without study (Jeremiah 31:33)[3]       * He will give you all the worthy desires of your heart (Psalms 37:4)       * He will take the barren land and make it abundant and fruitful (Isaiah 51:3, Amos 9:13-15, Ezekiel 36:29-30, Isaiah 11:6-9)

I can be driving on the freeway or walking during any time or any day and this will happen. at least once a day. The dream and vision thing happens pretty frequently. The light thing happens every day at least once. And The lights turn back on but not while I am there, I know this because I come back the next day and the lights are working, until I come near them. This doesnt happen indoors though. The lights turning off have happened thousands of times. If I am near other technological things this also happens.Can anyone give me some insight or help me relate?

I mean I find myself having these fantasies regularly and most I would be embarrassed to tell people out. Most are forbidden type of fantasies that society would look down upon. I think I am somewhat of a normal guy, but these fantasies and desires are still there. Just wanted to know if anyone else had these. Just interested I guess. You don’t have to admit to what yours are if you don’t want, but if you had the courage to go for it. I just wanted to see how many people would be willing to admit to this besides me. If anyone cares to leave there email addy then we could chat about some of are wierd fantasies if you would like. I would preffer not to send them out to the world, but would be willing to share them one on one. Mine is leavemealone230@hotmail.com add me to messenger or email me.

We only knew eachother for about a year and lost contact about a year or two before he died. He used to want to be with me but I had a bf at the time but I always felt like there was something there...anyway to the dream!!      Last night I dreamt I was down by the river with friends and I looked to my side and he was standing there smiling at me and said "Hey!" and another friend of mine next to him said "Look it's Jason" and I kept saying "It can't be, he's dead" I was in shock and my dead friend said "I know". There are a few blank spots but I remember touching him and it felt so real, gives me shivers thinking about it. I now feel really upset. Then he just disappeared I never fully grieved cos I hadn't seen him for so long I try not to think about it cos I get upset.      I have had a similar dream about him before but only once. Could he be visiting me? Thanks in advance :)

At fist I was like "this could be fun, and I can win another soul for Jesus".      But it turns out that lot's of Russians are already Christian. Which at fist I thought was super cool.....      But then when she was talking about Russia and I find out that abortion is legal, suicde rates are high, as are divorce rates and (I already knew) lot's of people drink.       That doesn't sound like a Christian Nation, does it? Anyway,...      Then she was like "but I am sad that my government doesn't allow marriage for gays".      Then we started argue over the issue of homsexurlity (she is for it!!)      Then we were interrupted by are Wednesday meeting teacher, she started talking about how all this week we are going to save up for missionaries (YAY!!!) in forgien places.      And the Russian was like " no. I'm not going to give any money. I don't think missionaries deserve it."      :O   Everyone was like "OMG!!"      So then the teacher was like "but you do believe in Jesus Christ, right?"      And she said "what's it to you?"   So freakin rude dude!! So rude!      That's not being a TRUE christian is it? :(      Well is it?!!

She verbally abuses his elderly father, and steals his pain  medication. She lies to get money from my friend to buy Oxycontin to shoot it up.   She's wrecked both his cars. She steals from stores. He thinks she is his girlfriend, but she won't have sex with him because she tells him she has no sexual feelings. Yet she sleeps around with other guys. How do I know so much about her? Because I used to be friends with her, too. I am a recovering pain pill addict. I tried to have a talk with him today to try to tell him that she's bringing him down. He's helped her steal among other things. His response to me was that Jesus hung around thieves and murderers, and we shouldn't judge our fellow man. This girl has no intention of changing. She lies as easily as she breathes. She steals. And she uses people. What do I say to him to counter his statements that since Jesus hung around thieves and such? I told him I think he worships her more than God, he said no. especially some biblical verses he can't refute. I want to help him

One example could be anti-tobacco propaganda. People used to enjoy and find smoking pleasant  and since anti-tobacco commercials appeared now everyone starts almost hating smokers. I see so many people who become extremist and start complain about every single aspect of a smoker. I wonder if commercial would be again if favor of smoking, then would people start seeing smoking okay again?      I mean it's okay if you're against or in favor of something but not just because majority do or just because of negative propaganda.   I know smoking causes several diseases and I  still love to smoke a cigarette at night and it doesn't matter for me if I die. It's okay but I hate when people come and tell me how bad I'm doing and starts saying that smokers smell bad, that smokers will have a dozens of diseases all that crap.

20090220184330AABOrRL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do you feel about prayer in the statehouse?	I am wondering how Christians feel about this story:      Groundbreaking Sanskrit mantras from ancient Hindu scriptures reverberated in the Indiana House of Representatives in Indianapolis today, reportedly for the first time since its formation in 1816.         Acclaimed Hindu statesman Rajan Zed read this prayer. Senators and others stood quietly in prayer mode with heads bowed down, when Zed recited from ancient Sanskrit scriptures after sprinkling gangajal (holy water from river Ganga in India) around the podium.         "It is a day of honor for us when ancient Sanskrit scriptures are being read in this great hall of democracy of the great state of Indiana," Zed said before the Senate prayer. After the Sanskrit delivery, Zed then read the English translation of the prayer.         Rajan Zed, who is the president of Universal Society of Hinduism, recited from Rig-Veda, the oldest scripture of the world still in common use, dated from around 1,500 BCE, besides lines from Upanishads and Bhagavad-Gita (Song of the Lord), both ancient Hindu scriptures. He started and ended the prayer with " Om ", the mystical syllable containing the universe, which in Hinduism is used to introduce and conclude religious work.         Reciting from Brahadaranyakopanishad, Zed said, "Asato ma sad gamaya, Tamaso ma jyotir gamaya, Mrtyor mamrtam gamaya", which he then translated as "Lead us from the unreal to the Real, from darkness to Light, and from death to Immortality."         Zed opened the Colorado House of Representatives in Denver with Hindu prayers for the first time in its history on Tuesday and shall open the Indiana House of Representatives with its first Hindu prayer tomorrow.         Indiana State Senate is composed of 50 members. Farm-filled state Indiana, known for its sports teams and athletic events, hosts Indianapolis 500 motorsports race, the largest single-day sporting event in the world. King of Pop Michael Jackson and talk-show host David Letterman are born here.          Hinduism, the oldest and third largest religion of the world, has about one billion adherents and moksha (liberation) is its ultimate goal.         --      Did we ask for it? Would a "moment of silence" be more appropriate? What are your thoughts?

I know from end of Judah kings at Daniel, it was easy for    some to know 2520 years in the future was given, but    now is 2615, since the last chapter of Daniel,    Dan.12:1-9, 10, has Michael in the time of the end    and at Rev.12:7-12, Michael gives Satan a short time,   how long will it take the prophecies in the N. T. to    fulfill as Satan must come down as to Rom.16:20,    then those Jesus prayed to be with him, where he    was in heaven, John 17:1-26, are raised up, John   6:39,40,44; 14:3, Michael is there to last, 1Thes.4:15-17.      Judah kings end year 3460 [ 2615 after + some ? and    future Rev.20:1-6, 1000 =] 3615, and this gives us all   a reason to double check what has been done by all?

There's not much they can do about the issue. If a supreme court justice dies or retires, they can appoint someone that they think will vote the way they want, if the case comes up before the court. And Roe v Wade has become bigger than abortion, it's fairly essential to the way the constitution is interpreted these days, so much so that I think even a hardliner like Alito would be reluctant to over turn the ruling.

Surrounded by cloudy(confused) witnesses:   - some saying there is no God   - some saying awful lawful Jehovah is true God   - some saying cancel religion instead of comparing   - some saying Paul is the anti-christ   - some saying Obama is the anti-christ   - some saying only Jews are chosen people   - some saying you too can have partiality from impartial God   - some saying   lead to the same thing   etc etc etc etc etc      So Paul says, when seeing we also are surrounded,   then it's time to do the end "run" along "with patience",   but patience does it at a grace pace: much more abounds,   so keeping up with patience seems to require a weight loss.      The "run": is it the same as, or different than "flee" in Matthew 24?   Is it an end run unto Grace, instead of fleeing law (worketh wrath)?      What do you think the weight is, in Hebrews 12:1?   Could every weight be every law, if law imputes sin,   and law also imputes unpardonable sin and death?      Hebrews 12:1   Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset [us], and let us run with patience the race that is set before us
20090220192102AAdX1Cc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	PLEASE help me christians?	PLEASE only christians answer, thanks      k well on nov.30 i was sick of not being sure if i was saved so i nailed it down and talked to someone and prayed to God and accepted JESUS as my savior, but now the devil, i think, is putting doubt in my head that i didnt meant it. i keep praying to God telling him i love him and i truly believe in jesus and accept him. I keep reading my bible too. It goes away for a while and then the doubt comes back telling me i didnt mean it.      i really do love God and jesus and I just want to live my life for God and be happy but this keeps hindering me from my fullest potential      PLEASE HELPPP
20090220185113AAStNyx	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do you unbrainwash a majority of religious people who want their religion in the government?	Sure, there are constitutions designed to keep religion out of the government, but don’t make the mistake of assuming constitutions are set in stone. They can change by referendum; it happened in California in the last election. Venezuela just recently changed their constitution to allow their president to become more like a dictator than a democratically elected leader. It’s the mob-like mentality that has the power and what happens if the mob-like mentality wants evolution thrown out of the education system and abortion made illegal and Pat Robertson elected as supreme overlord? It’s only a 10% minority of rational people to oppose them; do you think it’s only luck that this hasn’t happened already?
20090220183455AAVkPpI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is the only way to reduce religion in society to make new laws restricting people’s rights?	Sure, education is a good way to combat religion; the truth really is the best weapon against religion, but people are generally lazy. Religion is a lazy person’s way of pretending to know stuff without going through the effort of learning stuff. It’s this inherent laziness that needs to be overcome to defeat religion and as far as I can see, the only way to overcome that is to introduce new laws restricting people’s freedom. Or maybe I’m wrong; can you think of a way to reduce religion without reducing people’s freedom to believe and spread nonsense if they chose to do so?

Personally,   I think unless you are completely close minded you can easily see how they can go hand in hand and basically support each other.

'Police state is looming'   A former intelligence chief in Britain is warning that a police state is looming because of measures taken out of fear of terrorism... "The fear of terrorism is being exploited by the government to erode civil liberties and risk creating a police state,"       Iran Hails Military Ties with Russia   Iran's defense minister said today he hopes to obtain new weapons from Russia to upgrade the nation's arsenals. Iran has relied on Russian military assistance in the past and hopes to continue doing so, Mostafa Mohammed Najjar said. "Russia has advanced military technologies, we have used them and plan to keep using them," he said at a news conference-Israel and the U.S. fear that, were Iran to possess S-300 missiles, it would use them to protect its nuclear facilities, including the uranium enrichment plant at Natanz or the country's first atomic power plant now under construction at Bushehr by Russian contractors.

After lunch I go to my homeroom, where we have assigned seats (which sucks) the people at my table have been getting into religion big time. I mean the person who sits diagonal from me carries a Bible with her where she goes. I know the time will come when I'll be asked what I think about this and that from the Bible and whether I believe in God or not. Which I don't.       So is it better just to lie and basically be ashamed of my lack of belief, or should I just answer them with honesty?

20090220191344AAihtaW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If we supposdly have religious freedom in America - why no religious class at schools? Why is prayer banned?	RELIGIOUS FREEDOM means that ALL who believe in a religion, or want to learn about a religion, are ENTITLED to that right.      Are US school children entitled to that right? No. They are not. Why? Because religion is banned from public schools in nation. That goes against our right to religious freedom, my children should have a RIGHT to learn about religion in public school. They should have a right to say a prayer every day before class begins.      This nation was founded on Christian values. NOWHERE in the constitution does it mention "separation of church and state". Nowhere. Our school system should be based on Christian principals, and the bible should be mandatory for every classroom in America.      Please sign the petition to bring back prayer to public school:    http://www.petitiononline.com/mod_perl/s...

20090220225739AA1VvNW	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Half-man, half-bird, who can lead me to answers?	Story: My grandpa is on night watch at his neighborhood (this is in Mexico), he's sitting in this truck listening to music, nothing going on. Ahead of where he is, lies a tree. He hears rustling of twigs and what not as well as frantic wings flapping. He gets out of his truck thinking someone is trying to steal something. As soon as he gets out, he shines his lamp towards the tree and he sees what appears to be a big bird flying away, however, this bird has the legs of a man. And as it turns out, one of my aunts didn't see the bird, but she did on one occasion hear the same frantic flap of wings, while the neighborhood dogs barked frantically as well.       Does anybody know of a site that perhaps has information on this bird like creature? Or anything remotely related to it?

Ok well I was at my LGBT youth group yesterday and there was this lesbian that kind of caught my eye...It was strange because I've always considered myself GAY, and I've never been attracted to a female. She wasn't all that butch...she was EMO/indie-ish, with short hair, and very pretty. I wasn't like sexually attracted to her but I felt like I wanted to be her boyfriend. It almost feels like romantic feelings..Do you ever get a feeling of wanting to be a girl's protector, boyfriend, or like a brother?

20090221005108AAC45Ty	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Spiritually Speaking: Is the use of creative imagination of value here?	It may not give us a true picture on all points,but it will convey one great reality. The reality to which I refer is that there is no possible separateness in our manifested planetary life - or anywhere else for that matter, even beyond our planetary ring.      The concept of separateness, of individual isolation, is an illusion of the unillumined human mind. Everything - every form, every organism with all forms, all aspects of manifested life in every kingdom in nature - is intimately related to each other through the planetary etheric body (of which all etheric bodies integral parts) which sub-stands all that is.      Little as it may mean, and useless as it may appear, the table at which you write, the flower you hold in your hand, the horse on which you ride, the person to whom you talk, are sharing with you the vast circulatory life of the planet as it streams into, through and out of the form nature.      The only differences that exit are those in consciousness, and particularly in the consciousness of man and of the Black Lodge. There is only the ONE LIFE pouring through the mass of forms which, in their sum total, constitute our planet - as we know it...

His name is Pan, He was the "god" of shepherds and flocks, and is also known for his romanticism.      THE SYMBOLISM OF SATAN: (borrowed from a wiki article)   It is likely that the demonized images of the incubus and even the horns and cloven hooves of Satan, as depicted in much medieval and post-medieval Christian literature and art, were taken from the images of Pan.      Why did early christians choose the Greek "god" of romanticism as their evil doer, is it because he taught shepherds how to masturbate?

Something. I don't know how to point it out. Like something is wrong with me.       I'm just very nervous around people. I rarely am able to do anything with others because I don't want to be around a crowd of people I don't know. It stresses me out to a point that I just can't handle it. I get extremely nervous.       This past week, I was in the dining hall of my college and there was a lot of students. I actually was able to get a table to myself, but once I sat down, I ate my food so fast because I was afraid (literally scared) that someone would come and sit down next to me. So to avoid that, I ate my food very fast, just so I can get out of the dining hall.       I'm always avoid people, and I don't know why. Today, a guy I work with invited me to go bowling and I REALLY DON'T want to go. It's for sunday and I'm already stressing out, and it hasn't even happened. It's very frustrating to me that I'm like this at all. I don't get me. I'm not like this with certain people.       It's not even shyness. It's like some phobia or, I really don't know. What do you think?

I barely made any friends all four years there.   My dad started up his alcoholism and that lasted for about a year and a half.    My dad went to jail for a year and a half for DUI.   My dad left jail after 6 months because he was diagnosed with cancer.   My dad died 6 months later.   I havent made a friend thats a girl in 4 years.   I only have two good friends. My cousin and my friend that I have known since I was 3.   I was never invited to hang out with any of my friends I made at school.   My dads sisters daughter tried to hit my mom. I freaked out and tried to kick her out.   My dads sisters made a whole lot of rumors about blaming my mom for my dads death.   While my dad was in jail both of our cars broke down within two weeks of each other and we had to buy a new one.   Within these four years I think I was depressed at least once.      So would you say these were a bad 4 years.      I'm 18 about to turn 19 and all that happened within 4 years ending one year ago.   I still dont have a friend thats a girl. I havent had one for a long time. I dont talk to the friends I made in H.S.    I still have my cousin and my long time friend.    I am going to a good college.      I feel worthless right now.

The US has legally full separation of Church and State, but yet politicians are considered unelectable unless they have and declare Christian sympathies.      The UK does not have Church and State separation, but yet (in the words of Peter Mandleson) politicians "don't do religion", and faith is seen as a quietly unintrusive background noise in an otherwise secular nation.      Scandivian countries are essentially atheistic and appear successfully so; and many Arabic countries full theocracies, but basically medieval in outlook.      So my question, which kind of state would you prefer to live in?

I'm asking because at one job I had, I felt like all of the gossipping that went on really started to influence me negatively.  I became mean to a coworker because the supervisor and other coworkers would say mean things about her.  I'm not usually the kind of person who is influenced by gossip, but it was really insiduous.     And after I lashed out at that coworker, the same people who talked about her negatively, started to gang up on me to make me feel bad even though they were doing the same thing.  I take responsibility for it but I also thought that I would never have been mean if other people weren't constantly telling me negative things.  I feel ashamed and also angry at the same time.  Has anyone else been influenced by a negative work environment and what did you do to deal with the situation?  And if you were mean to a coworker, did you ever try to make amends?

I think many men and women are so dumb. Statistics tell us that most marriages will eventually end in divorce. Despite the very high divorce rate here in the US, why do "idiots" still want to get married? Sadly, the institution of marriage has turned into just a really big business and that's all it has evolved into. I've never been married and I never will get married because I'm just too smart. People obviously don't take marriage seriously anymore. That's not my opinion but a fact all over the globe, especially here in the US. Do you think marriage will eventually become a thing of the past? Any answers would be appreciated. Thanks!

20090221000812AAqIGCe	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Would it be more beneficial to be Christian rather than atheist?	It seems to me that being an atheist in a predominantly Christian culture is somewhat of a detriment.       For instance, when I move into my own home and start a family, the question will eventually come up (be it through neighbors, coworkers, extended family) as to what church I go to (because theists are like that).  I don't mind telling people I don't believe in a god, but I think that it would benefit me more if I just went ahead and lied and told them I went to church or am looking for one to go to.  After all, I did grew up Christian and was baptized and confirmed and all that jazz, so I could definitely fake it.  Who knows, maybe it will help me get a promotion, or be invited to baseball games by the neighbors or something like that.      I know I would be kind of selling out but if I had a reason to go to church I would.  I know, I'm an opportunist.        But then again arguing with Christians is a lot of fun.  And it would be quite interesting to be the black sheep of the neighborhood.  And faking it as a devout christrian would be near unbearable.        Another funny idea, would be to go the completely opposite route and convert to some off the wall crazy religion (yes even crazier than Christianity).  That might even be fun.  Seeing all those yahoos jumping around and stuff, listening to their horrendously absurd tales on how life began.  Hey, I would definitely come back with some interesting stories, that's for sure.      What do you guys think?  If subscribing to a religion could improve your life (not talking about being "saved" or any of that nonsense) would you?
20090221002101AA2Xz8a	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why no atheist group?	Would it be too hypocritical?  When you think about everyone has a group and that group is organized.  Gays, whites, blacks, christians, muslims, baseball players, auto workers, janitors, bald men, all have groups.  They all have lobbyists in Washington pulling strings to get what they want done done.  Why no atheist group?       It's really no wonder how politicians can actually consider teaching creationism in schools.  They have people.  We don't.  Maybe I should get on that....

20090221003601AAXPL2V	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	I know a lot of europeans and other english speaking countries hate americans, but?	The current examples are what I've faced online though, but I just wanted to see some opinions.        I was playing a turn based strategy game (we have a limit of time (less than 2 minutes) on our turn to maks moves and stuff). Some guy gets impatient (at a quarter of the way of my turn), starts whining and messages many lines of complaints like "godddd" and "hurry up". I get annoyed, so an argument sparks up. Sometime during the argument he calls me a dumb american (even though I never stated what country or gave evidence of where I was from, and i didn't make fun of any of his background). My cousin playing the same game says he's british, so sometime during the game, the guy tells my cousin that people are all like me in america, and how he thanks god he's not american, just because we were arguing, and I didn't say anything about my country. He just assumes that since I disagree with him and arguing with him, im an american.      I was playing an mmo, an some guy asks "what country are you from" to the people around. One guy says America, then he says "America sucks". The American guy wasn't making fun of him or anything. He just answers, and that's the reply. That's not very nice.      And another time on that mmo, somebody also asked, and when we said we were american, she says she hopes that we can locate U.S. on the world map.      On a youtube video about the game Mass Effect and a controversy it was goign through, somebodyleaves a comment of "thank god im european" and says how the controversy was stupid and that maybe Americans is enough to explain it (even though everybody else was leaving comments saying how the controversy is stupid just like he did, and many of them were american) so it wasn't even relevant that he had to talk bad about Americans, but he did.       And on sites such as this, and all around the internet, we get made fun of so much.      I'm aware that what our government did is very unpopular with the rest of the world, and I know we have our share (like everybody else does) of stupid people.      Why is it that if I argue, I'm an American   If I'm dumb, I'm an American   If I'm arrogant, I'm an American   Is there such a thing as a smart American to them?   Is there such a thing as a rational American to them?   Is there ever a good American to them?      I don't hate them, I don't make fun of them. I understand why others don't like our country, but why are we all grouped as one? Why do they say we are all racist and arrogant, even though they have acted the same way? Just because some Americans act arrogant, why do they assume all, then hate all? Do they not have arrogant people either? Are they all the opposite of what they assume all Americans to be like?

My friend is a lesbian and had her first kiss with this girl she was good friends with and had a crush one. The girl freaked out and never talked to her again, but also never told anyone about the kiss. My friend moved on and dated two different girls in her freshmen year. Then in her sophomore year the girl she kissed in 7th grade transferred to her school. They started talking and the girl said that she liked her and was scared in 7th grade, but wanted to date her now. They've been dating for about 2 years, but my other friend keeps saying that the girl probably isn't gay and is just experimenting. Do you think she would have been in the relationship for 2 yrs if she was just experimenting? Also would you have started dating her in the first place because of how she acted the first time?

He is a rich man in his fifties, owner of a wealthy yal?, a big villa on the shore of the Bosporus. Adnan is a widower, and father of two children: a daughter, Nihal, and a son, Bülend. Against the objections of her jealous mother, Bihter accepts Adnan's proposal: because of material reasons, since she is eager to lead a more prosperous life than her family can afford. But also because she wants to get away from her mother's range of influence. Her mother, Firdevs, is a member of the so-called group of Mr. Melih, a family of flirtatious women, fond of dressing up and going out. Bihter is afraid that her mother's reputation will keep away any other candidates for her, and afraid to end up the same way her licentious mother did. The marriage seems a good solution.      Bihter takes up residence in the rich villa, where life passes by calmly. The villa's main inhabitants are her newly wed husband, Mr. Adnan, and his daughter Nihal, who is fond of her father. Further, there is the easygoing son Bülend, Adnan's nephew Behl?l (a notorious rake), and the French governess Mlle de Courton. Finally, there is the domestic staff, the servants, especially Be?ir, a black slave, who is secretly in love with his mistress Nihal.      Bihter makes quite an effort to be a good wife to Adnan, to be a good stepmother to Nihal, to be a good lady of the house to the servants. But no matter how hard she tries, her efforts lead to nothing. The servants despise her. When one of them decides to leave, Nihal is convinced that it's a conspiracy of Bihter: it must be Bihter's goal to send away all people loving Nihal. Nihal starts behaving hostile. On top of this, Bihter discovers she doesn't feel any passion for her husband, Adnan.      She does find this passion for some time with Behl?l, Adnan's nephew who's living in the villa as well. Bihter resists, afraid that starting an affair will make her the same as her mother, but in vain. They have an affair. Nihal's confidante, Mlle de Courton, is sent back to France. Nihal gets recalcitrant. Behl?l is fed up with Bihter and returns to his mistress in Istanbul's night life.      At that point Bihter's mother, Mrs. Firdevs, suggests a demonic plan: Behl?l should marry Nihal. To Behl?l this seems a reasonable solution to get rid of demanding and insisting Bihter. He even manages to fall in love with the young and pure girl. After some hesitations, Nihal decides she loves Behl?l as well. Bihter eats her heart out with jealousy and considers to reveal everything to Adnan, and thus take revenge on Behl?l, Nihal and her mother Firdevs.      But before she can do so, the whole affair is already told by the servant Be?ir, who is secretly in love with his mistress Nihal. Bent on revenge, Bihter can't stand the idea of living as a fallen woman, which will be her fate from now on, and thus she shoots a bullet through her heart. Behl?l runs away, Be?ir dies from tuberculosis, but the female servant returns to the villa, and Mlle de Courton is on her way back from France. Father and daughter, Adnan and Nihal, can take up their calm, quite life again.

She went to the back of the bus with her friend and she talked about me until she got off the bus. I turned my headphones on my iPod up and tried not to get mad.   I was pissed for two reasons. One I'm mixed with black and irish and second, she didn't even know me. On top of that I don't know what looking black meant. I guessed it was based off of what I was wearing but all I was wearing was fur boots, skinny jeans, a striped shirt, a bomber coat, and hoop earrings.

20090220234937AAqYCf7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I need a religion, open to suggestions please?	I have a problem. I grew up in a catholic family, went to church frequently always wanting to feel a spiritual connection. I never managed this at church. I tried several Christian churches, but nothing. I gave up for a while, focused on school and then during grad school my life completely changed. My wedding got called off, I wasn’t sure about my career path, my dad lost his job, and I met my husband (which at the time was pretty chaotic, with a called off wedding and all). Anyway, I’m not sure if it was a gift because I was in such great need, but I finally found my spiritual connection. I would spend many many hours at the beach (I lived in an Island), not talking, just thinking, praying. I did this many times a week and I really felt like I was being heard, like I had finally connected with the Universe. I guess, maybe because the earth’s elements are so powerful at the beach.       To finish up, I’ll say I’ve moved from the Island to a he!!hole in southern CA. I’ve never been more depressed. I’ve been here almost three years and it feels like 30 and I just want to leave! I hate it so much. I’ve tried praying, but no joke, it seems like the more I pray the worse things get. The bottom line is we can’t leave, so I’ve been trying to get in touch with my spiritual side once again, to see if that makes life bearable. Not going good. Can anyone help me? Is there a religion that can actually help me get connected like I used to be? Do you have info?

I have gay friends who would always have their little "The View" sessions of talking about their love life, namely sex life. Being a woman, I can only have the satisfaction of receiving. Actually, pegging is giving, but not as if I have a penis. Which leads to the question...      What/How does anal sex feel like? Especially those who are a bit more... "uptight" than the norm. *wink wink nudge nudge cough cough* Is it like one of those "you can never know until you try" kind of sensation?      Note: I am not asking how it is to receive. Just to be very crystal.

20090221001246AAbBhLI	Society & Culture;Community Service	Hypocritical fundraiser?	Hi!       I have an animal-welfare club at my high school and we're participating in an event called club day; where all the school clubs sell food items as a fundraiser. Our dilemma is that we don't want to be hypocritical and sell something coming from the factory farms we're trying to stop. We decided on caramel apples, which are by far the most profitable of our ideas (about the only profitable one as a matter of fact), but after doing further research I've found the caramel we want has  evaporated milk in it. So my problem is this: should we go ahead and sell the apples though we're supporting the companies we want to stop, and hope that the amount of profit we make will have a greater impact on stopping the industries than the amount we contributed supporting them. Or should we just refuse to have any involvement with animal products? I know it seems like a minuscule problem, but it's not about the product, it's about the integrity of the group and our contribution to a cause we believe in.             Thanks for your help,      Amanda             ps-no one in my club objects to supporting the industries

I imagine it would be difficult, but I really hadn't been exposed to the situation at all until very recently.
