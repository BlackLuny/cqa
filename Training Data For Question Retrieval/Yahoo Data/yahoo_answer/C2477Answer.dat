That is effectively what the banks have done and that's why the economy is in the state it is.
VENS2WbGaa	The treaty signed after World War I treated Germany very harshly and was greatly resented by the German people.<br>  <br>      * The size of Germany's military was severely restricted.<br>      * Germany was forced to give up territories its overseas colonies, and lost territory in Europe.<br>      * Germany was ordered to pay $33 billion in reparations (war damages). <br>  <br>  This left Germany with grievances. In the Great Depression, which hit Germany early in 1930 unemployment was at terrible levels. Hitler made it his responsibility to defy all of the charges made on Germany through the treaty. He re-armed his nation, built up a massive army, re-militarized the Rhineland, and threatened neighboring states. It was obvious he was preparing for war.|`|Yi0sksmJaa	I think you need to do your own homework.

Germany and austria then attacked czeclosovakia and beat it after 2 attacks. after this Germany decided to attack poland and so they did with blitz kreig (in german lightning war) and britian decided to give a 3 day ultimatum saying get out of poland or its war. After 3 days britian was at war with Germany. shortly after that russia decided it wanted a share of poland so russia and germany started fighting over that and then other countrys just joined in... hope this helped|`|HeOVyxDtaa	japan bombed pearl harbor, <br>  fdr was more concerned with the rise of hitler and the nazis in germany though, so they joined france and great britain in fighting them.|`|pheJnqiHaa	hitler wanted to rule the world n he didnt like jews so he wanted to get rid of all jewish people and take over the world.|`|T0gS8uUtaa	it would take me longer to type it all out, than if you googled it or read up on it yourself.<br>  sorry but its true
AjqO1aJgaa	If the agent can figure out your age from your writing, it isn't worth publishing anyway.<br>  <br>  And you are mistaken. Vast numbers of teenagers write about "serious" subjects - in fact they are more likely to do so than adults are. They think this makes their writing more mature. It doesn't. If you want to be a non-average teen, then don't write about "serious things". Write about things you know about and experience yourself.<br>  <br>  The agent simply won't care how old you are. But you are right - if you write at a naive teen level about serious adult subjects, he will indeed go EW and bin your query. And so he should. There's little that's more sickening than a teen glossing over a life-changing event in a "happily ever after" manner.<br>  <br>  Of course, if you don't do this, he won't know you are a teen anyway. He's not going to go EW about writing he previously thought was good if he later finds out how old you are.|`|AA10242125	Join a Writer's group.

You need to open the camera and check if the film is being advanced. You should take it into a light tight room before opening the camera back just to be on the safe side. Then if you feel that the film isn't being spooled you can reload the camera in the daylight safely. Insure that the take-up spool is advancing the film and that you can cycle the shutter button. The film leader allows you two frame to get to the first exposure frame.<br>  I hope that helps you.|`|EiX4L2xQaa	Open it and see if the film loaded ok|`|GtBOQPKqaa	The FM is a totally manual camera, requiring batteries only for the light meter.<br>  <br>  Chances are, you're not cocking the film advance lever before you're taking the picture.

Try this method before resorting to other, "more drastic" means, such as fiddling with the film.

5wg7tKc6aa	You should go to a huge bookstore and go to the Fantasy section and read the backs to every book.  Just to see all the different story lines, and see which ones sound interesting.  When you find one that sounds interesting, write it down, and maybe chose a few to buy and begin reading.  That way you'll expand your Fantasy knowledge, and get the feel of all sorts of authors.  <br>  <br>  Also, try the Dark Materials series, it's very dark, and interesting.  Also, I've read the Maximum Ride series by James Patterson a couple of times, just because it's so damn awesome (but there's a lot of action).  <br>  <br>  Or, you could go classical and try the Lord of the Rings.

xe0BTHVZaa	In Cooks Brook their is a pool or beach that the author and I think a person named Cook Brooks used to swim. Their were people that were sometimes too afraid to dive or jump of the top ledge of the cliff by the water.<br>  <br>  The only problem to the dive was the shelf or rocks that was 2 feet bellow the surface of the water. The shelf of rocks reached out about 1/4 or a quarter of the way into the water into pool 10. Other than this the author thinks the dive was easy.<br>  <br>  Those that were brave enough to try to jump would stand in a line waiting for their jump. Their was always a moment before you would jump that you were scared and would doubt that you would make it across the shelf. while getting ready to jump you knew that you would rather die during the jump then have to climb down the ledge or cliff to get to the beach or water.<br>  <br>  For a moment before you would jump you would pray for wings to make it past the shelf and into the water safely. As you sailed towards the water into the sky the feeling were indescibable even after you landed safely into the water.<br>  <br>  You are suprized to find yourself alive when you see the sunlight that leads you to the surface and you happily (or leisurly) make your way to the shore as if it was a completely easy task and the jump was not scary at all. But wait she defied the demons who lived so terrible in the haunted hours of your sleep. She didn't make it. She died and didn't clear the shelf and those that did make it are haunted by the fact that she died.|`|Rd3Mj3O9aa	At the pool where we used to swim<br>  In Cooks Brook<br>  Not everyone had guts enough<br>  To dive from the top ledge<br>  <br>  Not that it would have been<br>  A difficult dive<br>  Except for the shelf of rock<br>  That lay two feet below the surface<br>  And reached quarter of the way out<br>  Into the width of the pool 10<br>   is about love<br>  <br>  As the water parts like a wound 30 <br>  To engulf you<br>  Then closes just as quickly<br>  In a white scar where you entered<br>  <br>  And you are surprised always<br>  To find yourself alive<br>  Following the streaks of sunlight<br>  That lead you gasping to the surface<br>  Where you make your way<br>  Leisurely to shore<br>  As though there had been nothing to it 40<br>  As though it was every day of the week<br>  You daringly defied the demons<br>  Who lived so terribly<br>  In the haunted hours of your sleep<br>  is about suicide<br>  <br>  One by one the brave few of us<br>  Would climb the cliff to the ledge<br>  And stand poised<br>  Ready to plunge headfirst<br>  Into the dark water below<br>  And always there was that moment of terror<br>  When you’d doubt that you could<br>  Clear the shelf<br>  Knowing full well 20<br>  It would be better to die<br>  Skull smashed open in the water<br>  Than it would be to climb<br>  Backwards down to the beach<br>  blindness of man marching off to war<br>  <br>  thats what i got.|`|nE5eqyWeaa	Face your fears, live for the moment, don't be afraid to to take risks.<br>  <br>  Read it literally and you'll get the whole metaphor.|`|e3AvZLZWaa	Maybe it's about courage and doubting that you can do something, but when you do it, you feel good and alive. Also about the demons, maybe it's saying that fear is the demons and it's haunting you always because you know that you're going to do the courageous thing again, and you're not sure if you can do it. Therefore, you're anticipating the days to come in fear.<br>  And these lines "It would be better to die, Skull smashed open in the water, Than it would be to climb, Backwards down to the beach" maybe those are saying that doing the fearful thing (jumping off the ledge or whatever) would be better than to show yourself as a coward. Basically, it's talking about being courageous and unafraid even when the most terrorizing things come along for you to do. It's about facing your fears even when your doubtful of you ability to do whatever you have to do. It's about being brave everyday and living life in anticipation of the feared.<br>  I don't understand the numbers though....

cciB0SmBaa	Cam,<br>  <br>  This is some nice writing. I only read down to the capitalized word 'TWICE.' I can see you've been writing before. The only thing I see here is the use of your three periods after a pause in the dialogue by one of the characters. If you are not starting the dialogue with an I, I've I'm, then you don't need to capitalize the next word. Starting the dialogue with ... isn't a good idea either if you're not breaking up the speech pattern and then starting with the same character. <br>  <br>  "I want to make Cam see that . . ."<br>  Cam listened to what was being said secretly.<br>  ". . . he only made some minor mistakes."<br>  <br>  The periods should also be separated as I did above. <br>  <br>  Quote:<br>  <br>  This was not the first time they had had such a talk;<br>  <br>  Unquote<br>  <br>  No need for the second 'had.'<br>  <br>  The word TWICE is not necessarily capitalized. What you do is use an M hyphen. That's done by typing (in your sentence that is) the word 'trick' and then punching in two hyphens and hitting the space bar. You'll see that it will change into one long hyphen otherwise called an M hyphen. Then you type the word 'twice'. This simply shows the word after the M hyphen (in this case twice) is said with authority. <br>  <br>  Nice writing here. I clear that you must do a lot of reading. You have a gift, Cam. Hone it up a bit and you'll really see a difference in how far you go with your stories. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  PJ M|`|TKZAYJokaa	i really liked it, im just wondering about their appearance...is abraham a wolf man?

B1LkXUKvaa	Okay, so I think u have a good idea/ideas going here. but u r just telling me everything that happened. SHOW me what happened. make a prologue, where you describe what have just told me, the parents dead, them taking you in. end with them telling u that u have to terminate the useless. now, u write about jason. u should first write about her finding jason, and get the reader connected to him. form a relationship. make us like him. <br>  and then u make a couple of chapters on them finding out. then a few more on getting caught. and then this scene. but add more detail to the scene (by the time u get to rewriting the scene, you'll be a better writer, and will be able to expand it.) then write about whatever your plot is from there. my main problem with this is that is too fast. now, of course, if u have a major plot and this HAS to be the beginning, u can just ignore everything i say. also, since i am not attached to jason, i don't really care much about him. but u have a really good idea going here. u should continue.|`|PuFlo7onaa	Its good... heres a few pointers...<br>  1. More detail- I don't know if this is a girl or boy. Give a little more background info on the training... What was it like? brutal or easy? long days? did they treat him/her right?<br>  2. Use different adjectives- I see the word pain about 3 times in 2 sentences..<br>  3. Setting- Once again i know nothing about when where who what and why... Work on that some more<br>  4.Why- Why did these people take her? Why was she the target? <br>  <br>  Other than those points your doing  great! keep up the good work|`|EnEEMJmYaa	Your story has a good story line but you need more detail cause your sentences are all short ones so there are too many periods and stuff.

Keep up the good work though, you're doing great.|`|doLGPEr1aa	It was good, but we need to know more about Jason and the training.

a0e2b182b59ad315c4b04f4c34347df1aa	The best way to view your writing is as though it's never complete, you can always make it better, and you should be prepared to be rejected. No matter how great your book is, you are going to be rejected, especially with a first novel. Stephanie Meyer (the woman who wrote the extremely popular Twilight series) was rejected several times before somebody jumped on her project. The best thing to remember is that just because that particular publisher didn't like your work doesn't mean it's not good, it just means you weren't a match for the publisher. It's like dating in a sense.|`|D1A2RruKaa	Your writing is obviously really good, so just believe in yourself and just keep trying. It doesn't hurt to try and get it published. Remember Harry Potter was turned down a lot of times before it was published and look at J.K Rowling now, she's a pretty rich woman. Honestly just believe in yourself.

It's very important for writers to polish their craft and enhance their natural creativity.<br>  <br>  I also suggest that you join writers clubs for you to learn from other writers.  There is so much you can get from those who are already seasoned.<br>  <br>  If you need information on how to get the book you wrote published, get this FREE book publishing guide and a publishing consultant will walk you through the whole process free of charge:<br>  <a href="http://www2.xlibris.com/requestkit/index.asp?src=aop&key=qac" rel="nofollow">http://www2.xlibris.com/requestkit/index...</a>|`|Lcr9FGS1aa	You may never get over it.Writing can be a solitary and torturous process.Publishing and critical response may be emotionally draining.You will need a burning passion and a disregard for others opinion to survive,let alone excel.|`|rSIF5jtSaa	You need to just send it in and take the constructive criticism.

If you already do this keep doing it. The only way you will develop your voice is if you write and if you write every day (I suggest a thousand words a day, but you can do more or less depending on how much time you're willing to put in and how fast you type) then your voice will develop quicker. (There's a rule that I heard that says your voice hasn't totally matured until you've written a million words.)<br>  <br>  Also, read a lot. That helps. Read a lot of stuff in the genre you write in that's selling well. That will give you an idea of how other people who write things simalar to you got successful.<br>  <br>  To boost your confidence: NO ONE at your age can really write very well but you can rise above everyone else if you sit down and write every day.

If that's not creepy I don't know what is!|`|kyBz7Rlmaa	In my opinion organ music sound sinister and a old, moss cover church can look pretty creepy at night.

Hmm...unfamiliar music?<br>  5. Perhaps people aren't that used to organ music and it's deep, resounding bass makes us uncomfortable?|`|bCKvsytYaa	Well, organ music has been played in horror movies before. So I guess our perception of it is, when we hear organ music we think of a scary movie that we've heard it in before. (ie; Phantom of the Opera [the original, as well as the stage production], Sweeney Todd. etc.) In the movies sometimes the church scenes are 'creepy' because of the way they portray it, you know, over-grown ivy and broken windows, a mysterious rustling noise. I haven't the faintest idea of why a hymn would be scary. Now, church statues maybe, some of them don't have pupils, and that is fairly creepy. In Scooby-Doo, the statues would come to life and follow them around, again, affecting the way we look at them. Also, it seems that no matter which way you move, it always appears that they're staring at you.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped. :D|`|Bina7xS1aa	my church aint scary lol<br>  <br>  ermm trying looking at photos of old victorian churches and gothic churches

9YUmSw62aa	okay im basing this on the person lets say a girl walking into the building.<br>  <br>  I crept in, not daring to make a sound. My breathing was ragged, coming in little rasps of air. Under my feet glass cracked. Chairs that were broken were strewn across floor. I could hear mice silently squeaking while trying to find a way to survive in this deathly building. A building I hadn't thought much of before as it was just an old,derelict building, nothing of interest in here everyone would think, never over examining it. i guess things change when your family's been held captive.<br>  I tip toed carefully through the remains of what looked to be an old dining room, maybe in olden days a happy family would have sat down and ate happily at that now crushed table. <br>  I made it across the floor quietly.I could hear his voice now the man that took my family, oh how i wished i could just run up and put a bullet through his brain. I braced myself as i climbed the stairs. This is the moment of truth.<br>  <br>  you can rephrase it if you like or just not use it at all.<br>  <br>  hope this helps in someway<br>  xox|`|O4mdaz1Baa	I ran into the old abandoned house searching for my family......gone.

I was alone.|`|J8xRVPulaa	Shattered glass glittered on the dark floor, it crunched and broke as i stepped into the hall. Gloom shrouded the dining room, where the table had been swept to the side and broken, chairs lay in haphazard heaps of wood, or overturned against the wall. The delicate china on the mantlepiece now lay in shards, a white tablecloth was entertaining a small fire. The house had been so furiosuly ripped apart, nothing lay untouched. But dominating the scene was not the destruction, nor gloom, nor the flecks of blood, but the silence. The absence of any human presence, of the ones she/he loved, was what was filling her/him with rising horrror.
AA12324252	Our movement started because we wanted changes from the 50s. Of course there were other reasons like the cold war, and Vietnam,where we burned our draft cards as protest against the war. Think of the changes we made for civil rights and women's rights. It was fun to burn our bras because we were tired of being in a harness. LOL. It was the 1st time a swat team was put in place with a snipper started shooting students at one of the universities. It was a time when draft dodgers protested by going too Canada to snub the government for forcing people to go to Nam.

kfOpbbCyaa	This is my general summary, though it leaves a lot out. You'll have to read it yourself to get the entire picture. You can read it here <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2042%20-%2045;&version=51;" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...</a><br>  <br>  There is a famine going on all over. In chapter 42, Jacob learns that Egypt has supplies (unbeknownst to him, it is because of Joseph and the interpretation of the Pharaoh's dreams that God had given him - and the fact that Egypt acted on what God told Joseph). Jacob sends his sons, except Benjamin, to Egypt to buy food. Joseph recognizes his brothers, but they don't recognize him. Joseph acts like they are spies and tells them to bring back the youngest brother, while he keeps one of the others in Egypt until they return. He says if they bring the youngest to him, he will know they are not spies. Simeon stays, the rest go back and find that the money they paid for the grain has been put back into their bags. At the end of the chapter, after the others got back to Jacob and informed him what was said, he is still refusing to allow Benjamin to be taken to Egypt.<br>  <br>  In chapter 43, the famine has gotten more severe and people are starving. Jacob (also called Israel) relents and tells his sons to go buy food in Egypt. Judah pledges his own life to keep Benjamin safe. Jacob then tells them to take twice the money necessary to pay for the food. Joseph causes his brothers to dine with him. (His brothers tell him of the money having been returned to them last time.) Joseph asks after Jacob and welcomes Benjamin, but doesn't reveal his name yet. Joseph makes sure that Benjamin is supplied with 5 times what the others have during this feast.<br>  <br>  In chapter 44, Joseph commands his servants to put the money back in his brothers' bags. He also tells them to put his own silver cup in Benjamin's bag. Then he sends his servant to go after them and act like the one who has the silver cup stole it from Joseph. Joseph says the man who has the cup shall stay with him and be his servant, but the others may go back to their father. Judah speaks to Joseph, telling him if Benjamin is not with them, his father will die of grief.<br>  <br>  In chapter 45, Joseph breaks down and sobs. Then he reveals his true identity to his brothers. He tells them that what they meant for evil, God used for good, not only for Joseph but for his entire family and far more. Then he tells them to get their father (and all they own) and come back to Egypt, where they will live in the land of Goshen, close to Joseph, who will take care of and provide for them. The Pharaoh was pleased about Joseph having his family restored to him and tells Joseph's brothers to get their father and all their households and come live where Joseph said. The Pharaoh gives them provisions and the brothers go back to tell Jacob about Joseph being alive and about the offer of land and provisions in Egypt. At the end, they are all going to go to Egypt.|`|877c11ba0aaa509142a50e675e9f83c6aa	READ it!<br>  <br>  It's 4 chapters, for goodness sakes.<br>  <br>  It'll take you 20 minutes, tops.

r9s0VyJgaa	OK, some basic accounting:<br>  <br>  Revenue = the money you take in from ticket sales, donations, etc.<br>  <br>  Expenses = the costs of running your group and putting on your events<br>  <br>  So, over the course of a given period of time, lets say a year:<br>  <br>  Total revenues taken in, minus all of your expenses equals PROFIT if after all the bills are paid, you wind up with more money than you started with.<br>  <br>  Total revenues taken in, minus your expenses equals a LOSS if after paying all the bills you wind up with less money than you started with at the beginning of the year<br>  <br>  A "for-profit" organization is one whose purpose is to take in more revenue than they spend for expenses (or to spend less than they take in) so as to earn a profit at the end of the year.<br>  <br>  A not-for-profit organization is one whose purpose is not to generate a profit, but to spend what they take in, in revenue, on programs and services for the benefit of the public.  Depending on how good they are at forecasting their expected revenues and budgeting their expenses, they may come out at the end of the year with some money left over, or they might come out with a little bit of a loss, but that's OK. Any money left over (surplus) will go into the budget to put towards next year's expenses.  Any losses or unpaid expenses at the end of the year will have to be covered by revenues generated in the new year .<br>  <br>  So there's no reason whatsoever why a non-profit organization can't have employees.  Hiring and paying employees is just part of the expense of running the organization and doing the work that the group was created to do.  And in order to cover the payroll and all of the other expenses of running the organization and putting on events, you have to charge for tickets, or solicit charitable donations, or both, or find other ways to generate revenue for the organization.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Mamianka is correct.  I didn't get into the legalities of organizing and managing a non-profit organization because I was specifically answering your question about non-profit organizations being able to pay employees.  But you can't simply set up shop and call yourself a non-profit organization -- you have to incorporate in the state in which you expect to do business.  That creates a legal entity which can then enter into business dealings and form contracts as any individual or for-profit entity would do.  Then you can apply for tax-exempt status with the Federal government.  That is typically done by applying to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS, after reviewing the application to ensure the organization meets the conditions to be recognized as a tax exempt organization (such as the purpose, limitations on spending, and internal safeguards for a charity), may issue an authorization letter to the nonprofit granting it tax exempt status for income tax payment, filing, and deductibility purposes. The exemption does not apply to other Federal taxes such as employment taxes. Additionally, a tax-exempt organization must pay federal tax on income that is unrelated to their exempt purpose.  Failure to maintain operations in conformity to the laws may result in an organization losing its tax exempt status.<br>  <br>  Individual states and localities offer nonprofits exemptions from other taxes such as sales tax or property tax. Federal tax-exempt status does not guarantee exemption from state and local taxes. These exemptions generally have separate application processes and their requirements may differ from the IRS requirements. Furthermore, even a tax exempt organization may be required to file annual financial reports (IRS Form 990) at the state and federal level.<br>  <br>  You really need to hire an accountant -- and probably a lawyer -- to advise you on setting up your non-profit performing arts group.<br>  <br>  But running a non-profit organization isn't easy.  Its very much like running a business.  You have to find ways to bring in revenue so that you can pay the bills, there are  Federal and state reporting and record-keeping requirements that have to be met, and you'll need to recruit a board of directors to help run it.  Before you get involved in starting something like this, you should be very clear about what it is you want to accomplish.   "Where can I go to get performers?" doesn't sound like you have a clear plan in mind, or any experience in this matter!|`|sc4BtGxGaa	I assume you are a US citizen.  I *think* what you want is a "501c3"corporation.  I am sure that Rachel knows about this, but she did not want to scare you.  This legal designation entitles you to operate in such as manner that your staff are paid, and you can solicit donations from people - as well as charge for tickets, ads, etc - the usual revenue sources.  Connected to this, you should be able to get a tax-exempt status, so that you are free from paying sales tax on the equipment you must purchase to run your business.  You CANNOT do any of this as a NFP unless you have this legal designation.  You can get a local DBA from your municipality, to conduct a BUSINESS - but this is certainly not a NFP.  You are in the same category as someone who owns a bakery, paints houses - and the IRS is VERY fussy about this.  VERY fussy.  Rachel and MY accountant could sap MANY stories about just HOW fussy - you can see that they do not want people to run a NFP as a way to HIDE otherwise taxable income.  And - your performers and staff ARE taxed on their earnings, you know - anything over $600, and you must issue the proper forms for THEIR income tax filing.  You are going to NEED an accountant!<br>  <br>  You will need legal assistance to do this.  Many communities have an Arts Council that will help you find an attorney who will do this on a *pro-bono* basis.  When I did MINE - it cost me $5,000.  My corporation is now inactive, since I returned to full-time teaching shortly after I received the designation - and keeping a NFP solvent IS a full-time job!  Now that I have recently retired, I intend to revive my 501c3 status, as I have more concert and educational projects that will benefit from this designation.<br>  <br>  So - your performers get paid, your staff gets paid, you can solicit donations and generally run the business end of your performing group - BUT - it troubles me that you do not HAVE performers already.  It sound like you want to be some kind of impresario, or someone who PRODUCES arts events - and yet you sound VERY VERY new at all this.  I am a classical musician, and we do concerts of chamber music with added string players, singers, etc.  (BTW, you could not have picked a WORSE time to start all this - corporate AND individual funding is at a low point - have you not heard anything about the ECONOMY???).  Most NFP corporations come from the performing aspect FIRST - there are people who wish to DO something in the arts, and need to proceed in a business-like method.  To go through all this for what SEEMS to be altruism on your part - I am confused.  YOU certainly are not going to get anything at ALL like a steady income from this, not even a part-time income, and the WORK involved is huge -0 it truly must be a labor of love, or you must have some OTHER stake in it.<br>  <br>  Please write back and clarify your intentions, because I worry that I may have mistaken yours.

I always wondered if either way it would matter if we were not here.|`|AA11828439	Yes, and trees that fall in the forest still make noise without a witness.|`|Lcr9FGS1aa	unprovable,with no observation possible....much like faith...|`|spYpsixUaa	According to Alice B., the universe might just continue to exist without us.  According to Quantum Mechanics, physical reality ceases to physically exist when it is not being observed by a consciousness.  Is it really up to us to say that animals do not possess consciousness.  If you say that they do, then the universe would fail to go away with our nonexistence.|`|h2HxsSJ5aa	Yes.  Consciousness is an irreducible property of the physical.  Experience cannot be accounted for by any description of observable phenomena, not matter how detailed, but it undeniably exists.  It can't necessarily express itself, but it's always there, rather like magnetism.  Therefore, in a sense the Universe is always observed, so the answer is yes.|`|GpPclegDaa	There can be no definitive answer, simply because people do exist to observe and ponder about it. One might reasonably  infer that it would still exist, But it is untestable, and will therefore remain unsolved.|`|07fd7ea1dbff60f8707ba40041258bc9aa	If it was any different you wouldn't be here to observe it, and without people the universe would be more messy than it is.|`|BVf2eAWnaa	yes, I believe there's an objective reality independant of humans.|`|NzP09sGdaa	Does it matter?

46IiIKyXaa	I've taken a lot of photographs in cemeteries (including my 360 background) . Most are open to the public from sunrise to sunset . I've never had a problem. Taking photos is not damaging property or disrespectful so don't worry about it. Most bigger cemeteries have rules posted somewhere but it's mostly "do not walk your dog here" or what ever. Smaller/older cemeteries are sometimes privately owned but it should still be okay as long as it doesn't say "no trespassing". If someone says something (which has never happened to me and I've been in many,many cemeteries) just respect their wishes and move on. You won't get in trouble as long as you follow any posted signs. Obviously not while their is a funeral going on, or of other people who are paying their respects. <br>  Some cemeteries from the Victorian times were designed as beautiful park like places for people to stroll through and are very peaceful. Some people get too sensative and morbid about cemeteries and their is really no need for it. <br>   People only get in trouble in cemeteries when they are partying or doing rituals after dark. <br>  I know of a cemetery that got such a bad rap for stupid kids doing "satanic rituals" in it that nobody in the town will talk about it because it attracts disrespectful people. I've been to it and it's not creepy or anything like all the stories people make up about it. <br>  Just be considerate and you'll be fine.|`|AA10961798	Getting permission to take photos of ongoing funeral services is a MUST.  Don't be surprised if you get "NO!" for an answer, and that should be respected.<br>  <br>  Also, get permission before taking photos of mourners at existing grave sites, even if the people's faces won't be recognizable.  It's a matter of courtesy and respect.<br>  <br>  There may be legal issues with publishing/publicly displaying photos of markers and monuments without permission of the that person's family.  If the photos are for a class project, private research and documentation, etc.,  you shouldn't have a problem.<br>  <br>  If the cemetery is a general one that's publicly owned and open for general family visitation, photography in general is okay (but see my caveats above concerning taking photos of services and mourners, and for publication/public display).  Asking permission for photography at private and "open by appointment only" cemeteries is the best idea.|`|B62KOzsdaa	Yes.|`|AA10063059	yes|`|01e7be90a0bc3f8793113187512fc895aa	I don't think you'll get in trouble. You can ask someone that works there if they have some special policy on that but I doubt that they do. I take pictures in local cemeteries all the time, and I know a few other people that do the same.<br>  <br>  You should have no problem, but if you're worried about it, just consult someone there.|`|zjaCDk1laa	yes, i had to for an assignmet for my class, have fun.|`|TLzknS0eaa	Yes; photographers,photography students even art students(sketch) do it all the time.If there's a gatehouse check in with them first and maybe bring some pictures to show that you're a serious student.Just show respect and don't change or move anything.It wouldn't be a good idea to snap people though-still to still life.|`|8jK33jK1aa	Yes, you should be able to take photos.
HAEjoPVRaa	1. to gain land. Darius wanted to extend the land of his empire.<br>  2. A) Marathon B) Athens, with no help from Sparta because of a festival<br>  3. Various stories: one says a man ran all the way from Marathon to Sparta to ask for help, they refused and he ran back. Another is that he ran from Marathon to Athens to proclaim a Greek victory. Probably the latter is the origin of the marathon race.<br>  4. Xerxes wanted to revenge the defeat of his father and wanted to conquer the Greeks, again.<br>  5. 7,000 Greeks, 300 Spartans, 200,000+ Persians. The Greeks held the pass for 5 total days, 3 days of fighting and killed over 20,000 Persians. On the third day of fighting, a traitor named Ephialtes (which means nightmare in modern Greek) led the Persian Immortals on a goat path around the Greeks. Leonidas told all the other Greeks to leave and he, the Spartans, and some Thespians stayed. They were all killed by arrows, which the Greeks thought were a cowards weapon.<br>  6. The Great Wooden Wall, which was Athens fleet, not the wooden wall atop the Acropolis.<br>  7. Much like Thermopylae he drew the Persian fleet into the narrow straights where their numbers were at a disadvantage, then the Greeks utterly destroyed them while Xerxes watched from his golden throne.<br>  8. The Greeks (and its spelled Plataea)<br>  9. Delphi, don't got to war when their is a religious festival.<br>  10. A boat with three rows of oars stacked on top of each other with a large bronze ram in the front.<br>  11. Look at a summary of The Gates of Fire (Steven Pressfield) for this one but...<br>  <br>  We fought three days here on this ground called the Hot Gates, between the mountains and the sea. We killed many Persians, knocking aside their soft wicker shields and cutting through their layers of clothing, they don't even have proper armor. But now, on the third day that traitor, Ephialtes has led the Immortals behind out backs. We will die to the last but the prophesy will come true. A Spartan King must die or Sparta herself will be destroyed, Leonidas is that king! They come now, the Immortals. They are the only Persians who have anything that resembles armor but we will still take many of them to the house of death with us. We can see the whites of their eyes now. Leonidas charges, his sword is a blur and he kills them, cutting off army and punching his eight-footer into the bowels of the Persians. But then he falls, and we drag him to the hill. Our swords or shivered our shields shattered but we fight with hand and foot, teeth and toes. The Persians draw back and blessed death comes upon us in the form of the cowardly arrows of the Persians. We have saved Greece and are at peace.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|RLQPWkXCaa	Watch the documentary "Last Stand of the 300" here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2En9cW9bLhc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2En9cW9bL...</a><br>  <br>  and you will find answers to all your questions.

dLHmyy2Qaa	Oooh, quite a question. I'd think of Rome the most. They built a huge empire, stamped their own culture and way of life onto those of other countries, or in some cases, merged theirs with others. Their building knowledge - aquaducts, drainage, underfloor heating etc, was innovative. Government structures and bureaucratic methods have had influences ever since (whenever I hear of the US Senate I think of ancient Rome). Latin has found it's way into many languages, embedded into many english words.<br>  I'd also say the Hebrews. Their religion is the basis of Christianity, the main western religion.|`|AA11828439	all|`|CwJtuJ8Kaa	ans would be Greek-Roman(art of war/politics) <br>  and Hindu-Indus civilizations(discovery of zero(we are using yahoo because of that!!)/phylosophy-religion/commerce and ofcourse Sanskrit-the source lang of all Indo-Aryan Languages including the language that u&me used to ask ans this Qustion-ENGLISH)<br>  <br>  Mesopotamian and Egyptian coudnt get enough time to influence modern societies..but still they did some(paper/paperus) as did chinese(rockets/gun powder wr used 1st by them)<br>  <br>  Hebrew????? :-O<br>  In my view Hebrew was a mix of roman-iranian-egyptian society

They were farm wives, which included having babies at home, making bread from scratch, cooking without microwaves,  helping milk cows everyday, making and tending huge vegetable gardens and canning each fall.  They also helped their husbands with farm, taking care of chickens, pigs, and cows and cooking for the harvest crews each fall.  And they took care of their kids, sewed clothes from patterns, made jam and jelly, and got up at 4:30 am most days. Today their children care for them. They still like reading the paper, puttering around, but they sleep a lot. <br>  <br>  Will I live past a hundred?  Maybe.  it is in my genes.  tell ya in about 40 plus years.

yWloDrF8aa	First of all it sounds like you really need a user manual for that camera which you'll find here - <br>  <a href="http://www.butkus.org/chinon/fujica/fujica_stx-1/fujica_stx-1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.butkus.org/chinon/fujica/fuji...</a><br>  Assuming things look clear and sharp in the viewfinder, fuzzy and unclear pictures are usually caused by too slow a shutter speed combined with camera shake, try using 125 or faster shutter speed.<br>  Look through the viewfinder and, while watching the exposure meter needle, turn the Aperture Selector Ring on the lens to bring the needle into the center of the indentation.<br>  If the needle isn't moving at all check that the battery compartment contacts are clean and the batteries are the correct type with the plus sides (+) facing outward from the camera.<br>  If that doesn't make the meter work it just might be dead and you'll probably need to buy yourself a hand held meter which will be more useful and effective anyway.

Tom is described as "Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward.".... Tom had "a body capable of enormous leverage-a cruel body”.<br>  "His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts."<br>  <br>  it has to do with how he describes the characters with appearance, voice, ect, when you are first introduced to them

GpPclegDaa	I have never liked this question. I will answer it in two ways:<br>  <br>  1) There is no such sound. "clapping" is "clapping" by virtue of the fact that two hands meet and produce a sound. One hand Cannot clap, so there is no sound.<br>  <br>  2) If, hypothetically, such a sound were produced, it would make a sound like "CLAP" because the term "clapping" is an onomatopoeic term that describes the sound the  action produces.<br>  <br>  The answer is right in the question, either way.|`|h2HxsSJ5aa	"SWOOSH".<br>  <br>  That's a flippant answer.  The real point of the question is to paralyse the rational part of the mind, so it "startles" one into enlightenment.  It's one of a lot of similar language games called koans, popular in Zen Buddhism.|`|uIfbWdsvaa	personally i would say there would be no sound considering clapping is the action of two things together making a sound, if it were one hand then it would not be clapping.|`|7ubZ5jRNaa	Depends, is the one hand clapping AGAINST something?<br>  <br>   If not, then quite obviously no sound at all.|`|07fd7ea1dbff60f8707ba40041258bc9aa	But just after that particular bit on the Simpson's, Lisa explains that it is a riddle to clear the mind.|`|AA12324252	It sounds exactly the same as one hand waving.|`|26DoxkOBaa	It's a Zen Koan. Zen Koans will ask a spiritual question and the answer will be something ordinary and mundane. Then when a mundane question is asked, a spiritual answer will be correct. So because what is the sound of one hand clapping is a mundane question, the answer would be something like, because the hand and sound are one, the Master knows the Reality of nothing and hears the sound of the hand.|`|QYPrM3GPaa	This is another Zen Buddhist question, just like the question about the tree falling (what noise would the tree make if no one was there to witness it).  <br>  <br>  The fact is, I can take my one hand and clap it against a table, a wall, a door - literally anything.  So yes, a single hand can "clap," just not against another hand.  <br>  <br>  Secondly, if it had nothing to clap against would be impossible - simply because there will always be air (unless we are in water in which case, I can clap a single hand on the surface of water).  It is impossible because when my hand moves in air, it moves molecules of air, and those molecules strike each other and produce a kind of clapping - according to current theories in quantum mechanics - everything is tied in the universe and whatever is observed is affect - so if I observe my hand clapping molecules of air, than everything else in the universe is affected by it and that is quite a big "noise."|`|8ekoa6szaa	I, too, think it's one of the dumbest questions I've ever read.<br>  <br>  But, since you asked, I would say that it is the sound of silence!|`|kTc3bfrRaa	its   to  low  of a  sound to  hear...however!!.  if  its  hitting something else..  such  a s  a   leg   or  hand  it   goes     (((CLAP..CLAP)))|`|NzP09sGdaa	The sound of one hand clapping is blue.

Look at people like Vengerov and Perlman, they picked up a violin and were able to do amazing things with it from the start!<br>  <br>  Really, it depends on how much time you are willing to give it.

2TLXfQKDaa	It's definitely not the lens, but rather your setup.  Shallow depth of field works on lots of different apertures from low to medium very well.  At the shallow end of your focal length 18mm your widest aperture is going to be 3.5 and 5.6 at the 200mm end.  Some would tell you you can only do the blurry background at 3.5, others will say you can only do it at 1.8 and lower >.>  Wrong wrong wrong.  Yes you can achieve an overall shallower dof, you can still use something like F11 to achieve a blurry background, take a look at your setup to see what the problem is.<br>  <br>  Most likely it's a combination of things as it takes this combination being setup properly for it to turn out well in the first place.  Suppose I'm using my variable aperture lens 55-200mm F4.5-5 DX non VR, and I want to take a pic of a flower.  Using the 200mm end I can only expect my aperture to open as wide as F5 (which is fine).  Ok I now compose the shot.  The background I'm going to use is the forrest way off in the distance.  This is extremely ideal for a shallow depth of field.  I could also have gone with a wider aperture and just stood closer, but I wanted a narrow angle of view which the 200mm will give me.  So my distance to the subject is a few feet, I'm zoomed way in, and the distance of the subject (flower) to the forrest is about 100 feet.  With my aperture as wide as it is, this WILL give me a shallow depth of field.   Now suppose I were to use the same aperture but decided to take another picture, this time of a flower about 1 foot from the forrest line.  I'll use the same distance for me to the subject a couple feet, same zoom and aperture, but this time the dof won't be as shallow.  The background being closer to the subject means it's not going to be as shallow as it was in my first situation.  Will it still be blurry? You betchya, is it going to be as blurry as I could possibly get it which would draw more attention to the flower?  Nope.  There are many factors for depth of field, but mainly they are.  Aperture, distance to subject, and distance behind subject.   Playing with these will bolster your knowledge pretty quickly.  Give it a few shots and try it out.  Remember wider aperture = lower Fnumber = shallower dof.<br>  <br>  If you want more breakdowns and examples check out the following links.  <br>  <a href="http://www.picturecorrect.com/photographytips/207/creative_settings_depth_field.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.picturecorrect.com/photograph...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.tutorial9.net/photography/depth-of-field-in-photography/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tutorial9.net/photography/dep...</a>|`|FYnI8VsLaa	I have that lens on my Nikon N70. I love it because of the focal length. However, it doesn't do very well in low light and up-close subjects. I went online to adorama.com and purchased an AF Nikkor 50mm 1:1.8D. It was a great purchase! And for a great price too. But without knowing better what's causing the issue, it's hard to tell.

Unfortunately these are expensive lenses.<br>  <br>  Chris

The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.[2]<br>  <br>  Abstract art, nonobjective art, and nonrepresentational art, are loosely related terms.<br>  <br>  Abstraction indicates a departure from reality in depiction of imagery in art. This departure from accurate representation can be only slight, or it can be partial, or it can be complete. Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is likely to be exceedingly elusive. Artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance color and form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially abstract. Total abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In geometric abstraction, for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. Figurative art and total abstraction are almost mutually exclusive. But figurative and representational (or realistic) art often contains partial abstraction.<br>  <br>  Both Geometric abstraction and Lyrical Abstraction are often totally abstract. Among the very numerous art movements that embody partial abstraction would be for instance fauvism in which color is conspicuously and deliberately altered vis-a-vis reality, and cubism, which blatantly alters the forms of the real life entities depicted.|`|GNa37oJXaa	art that looks as if it has no meaning but when you look hard enough and long enough to soon find the inner secret as to why the artist painted this in the first place (or drew it) its the beauty of the human mind!!!|`|AoaKWfW7aa	its a type of art. just paint something random and you have abstract. can you anser my question.what kind of fish get along?|`|FWNbi4tuaa	Abstract art uses a visual language of form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world|`|kJKEwVJZaa	me|`|gO0AmLoDaa	The idea of abstract art is to get the "essence" of something.

It's because you have a slow shutter speed.  Using a tripod (or having stabilization built-in) prevents the camera from shaking when you have a slow shutter speed but it doesn't help prevent motion blur if something is moving in front of the camera.<br>  <br>  Two things that should help are 1) raising the ISO, and 2) using the flash.|`|i5OVORXgaa	You need to use a faster shutter speed... too bad your camera doesn't allow you to control that though.|`|qxy9xCAsaa	My first piece of advice is to buy a Canon.

Somehow in your verbal or nonverbal encounter, something of them ripples into you and through you to others. The witness is the inheritor and legacy of the experience. But I'm giving you the self-centered interpretation. A witness is a bystander who happens upon the pivotal event--the life to be witnessed. The life to be witnessed is the leading actor in the story, and we're the props in their life drama. So to be a witness in this case means being the thing that is used, consumed, adapted, manipulated according to the needs and fancies of the person to whom we are witness. They are the subject of the sentence and we the adjective. We are playing into their life stories as stepping stones to be stepped on. <br>  <br>  This really brings up such rich thinking material.

Pgam2HLuaa	Dearest Ducky. You surprise me. Tattoos are, and always have been, firmly the domain of the servants quarters. It’s all very well for a coachman to have a blue swallow on his hand, or for some feckless youth of below stairs provenance to have the name of his latest bint, or just  ‘Mum’ stamped onto his burly forearms, but that sort of thing simply wouldn’t do for a gentleman. I did once contemplate having my family crest carved into my chest with a ceremonial investiture sword, but that was as far as it went. As for that wanton trollop Barbie, I see that things are going from bad to worse. The next time she comes crawling back to me, she’s in for a surprise. I’ve just invested in some branding irons. Let’s see how ‘cool’ she thinks that is!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Mrs Clean, what insolence - how dare you mention that name,  back to the laundry this instant. And if you must know, it was Pat Pending, a sweet girl from the village with whom I had a dalliance many years ago.

Whereas lying to others is selfish, lying to ourselves is plain stupid. How is it even possible to fool ourselves? How can we be both the deceiver and the deceived?<br>  <br>  We may not initially recognize how much we do lie to ourselves. It is an easy thing to deny because there is no solid evidence that we do so. We do not utter the lie aloud, and no-one is there to hold us accountable. Thus, it is easy to pretend that it never happened (thereby lying to ourselves yet again).<br>  <br>  The reason that we lie is to stop ourselves being hurt, usually to protect our self-esteem. There are thoughts that we find unacceptable, and thus we simply refuse to think them. We hope that soon the reality will change and that the lie will be inconsequential. For example, we may deny that we are depressed, hoping that soon the depression will go away. Our reasoning is that if it does go away then our lie will no longer matter, and we will have avoided dealing with a painful reality. However, it is never a good idea to sacrifice our integrity, and it is never a good idea to lose touch with truth. Just as lying to others will lose their trust, so does lying to ourselves compromise our own trust. We lose the ability to understand ourselves clearly and to be sure about what is true and what is not. The result is the insanity that currently pervades society.<br>  <br>  In an effort to stop lying, it is worth asking ourselves what thoughts we find so unacceptable, and why. This tells us what issues we must work on to cease this harmful habit. We should also make sure that we talk to people who will tell us the truth, instead of those whom we know will support or believe our lies. Other people are valuable for telling us the truth about ourselves. Their view is warped through a lack of information, but our own view is warped through self-deception. We can assume that the reality lies somewhere in between.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, regardless of why we lie to ourselves, we must stop. Although understanding the reasons for our self-deception is helpful, we can still break this habit through sheer willpower alone. When we find ourselves blaming others for our own problems, or talking about ourselves in an effort to sway their opinion of us, we can be sure that self-deception is taking place. This is our cue to stop. In the words of Shakespeare: “To thine own self be true.”|`|11nqBcOcaa	EGO getting in the way your true self|`|SiPGcBnYaa	denial is bliss|`|5agXk9ldaa	this lis life

80fe33f812b38b64e5381d4e48dd195faa	What style of dance is it?  I'm a b-boy (breakdancer), so I only have experience with b-boy battles.  Also, is it 1 on 1 or a crew/team battle?<br>  <br>  Basic battle rules:<br>  <br>  For 1 on 1:<br>  There is usually a certain number of rounds that must be performed.  For example, 'A' and 'B' are battling, each have to do 3 rounds.  'A' goes first, followed by 'B'.  Thats round 1, and you repeat until 3 rounds have passed.  You can also have a time limit instead of rounds.  For example, a battle can last for 3 minutes.<br>  <br>  For crew/team battles (2v2, 3v3, etc...):<br>  Each member on each crew goes once.  For example, you have crew 'A' and crew 'B'.  Each has 3 members.  A member from 'A' would go followed by a member from 'B'.  After, another crew member goes out followed by someone on the other crew.  Keep going until everyones gone out.  Or you can have a time limit for the battles instead of rounds.  For example, a 3v3 battle can be 5 minutes.  This allows for crews/teams to perform group routines as well as freestyle solo.<br>  <br>  If its a free-for-all, then it would be a cypher, where anyone can just jump into the circle and call people out.<br>  <br>  Of course, these arent really the "official" rules.  Change the rules to your liking<br>  <br>  Number 1 rule:  No Touching.  You can taunt, burn (hand gestures), insult, etc, the enemy, but absolutely no touching.<br>  <br>  Also for judging, try not to let the crowd judge the battles.  Most of the time it will be biased.  Try to get some dancers with experience as judges, if you can, based off of what dance style is being performed.  For example, rarely does a b-boy battle get judged by a crowd as seen in movies.  In real life, there are about 3 professional b-boys who judge battles based off of many aspects such as cleanliness, execution, difficulty, musicality, etc...

Pressure built and the water in the cooling system superheated, blowing the roof off the reactor building.<br>  Exact figures are difficult to establish, about 50 station staff and fire fighters died as a direct result of the disaster.

When the nuclear devices get out of hand they start overheating and continue to do so, the unrelenting power continues to the temperatures of the sun, therefore the "syndrome" of it.

b620ee9ffe6252c90305858258e1bd65aa	The most important thing lost is human lives, in WW1 England lost a whole generation of middle and upper class men who could have contributed who knows how much, to their country.<br>  Old historical towns were totally destroyed, cultures were lost, beautiful cathedrals, churches and towers, walls etc. all gone. These losses were on all sides, when you win a war the price you pay is enormous in human resources, economical destruction as well as historical and heritage of ones people. The same and even worse happens to the country-countries who started the war. If you look at total wars before the two world wars like the 30 years war etc. you will see in wiped out the old and made room for changes. Same happened in both world wars. The map of the world changed after WW1 and certainly after WW2, is that good? bad? who gained who lost, those are difficult questions. But for sure most everybody losses. There are winners in wars but I guess that is not what you intend to talk about (weapon merchants as an example).
jqyTUuPHaa	I say freshman, because when your first entering high school, your trying to find out what group to be in, and you enter this world where a bunch of different people clash, and it's the whole clique thing again!  I like the idea with the boyfriend thing, and maybe she can have a best friend who is a boy, who belongs to the non popular group, and in the end the boyfriend cheats on her and she realizes she really likes her best friend and they end up together.  Those always make me happy!<br>  And some of your mini plots are harsh on her!  Mom getting cancer, dad cheating on mom, brother having serious problems!  I hope they get resolved peacefully!  As for the name?  Hmmm.  How about Jenna Copelan??  She could be attracted to the fact that these 'popular' girls are just so flawless.  Their hair, lives, their personalities (they don't have to be mean) and even the fact that they have athletic ability (cheerleading, maybe?) and she just wants to have a life like that.  And I wouldn't make them COMPLETELY loaded with money, maybe just have them have a good amount to afford nice clothes and stuff.  Good luck!!|`|9cBAUMnNaa	Dude, I think 4 very dramatic mini plots is more than enough. I would worry more about developing the existing characters and simplify the whole thing.

Which I think would make it easier for the reader to understand why she is attacted to the unpopular girls, because they're happy with themselves, they don't feel the pressure to fit in and be perfect, and they have self confidence. If that makes any sense?<br>  <br>  But what you have so far sounds like it would make a great story, I think it'll turn out good:)|`|DvToP5h7aa	Short Story Ideas; where flashes of inspiration are only a click away<br>  <br>  <a href="http://shortstoryideas.herb.me.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://shortstoryideas.herb.me.uk/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.midlandit.co.uk/education/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.midlandit.co.uk/education/ind...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_18026_generate-short-story.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_18026_generate-s...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.howtobooks.co.uk/leisure/writing/childrens-story.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.howtobooks.co.uk/leisure/writ...</a>

PFjIVvMmaa	I think that dramatic arts would just be acting and theatre arts would be EVERYTHING in theatre, including writing, backstage, etc. SO I think playwrights would fall under theatre arts.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	They're the same.|`|08ecd8b76e95de5e722d935f06309747aa	they're basically the same. "dramatic" arts is probably just based more on acting but nobody really uses that. it's just "theatre arts" most of the time because they usually want you to know everything about instead of just acting. so playwright would fall under "theatre arts." Just like if you are applying for something on the internet and have to use "Fine and Performing Arts" and they don't have it, it is okay to click "Fine and Applied Arts." it falls under art, drawing, music and theatre. it's all the same, just focused on a certain subject more

0aXRDfOLaa	Almost all the colonized countries wanted their independance. It's not very pleasant to have your country governed by strangers.<br>  The British were very imperialist (just like the other colonial powers) and stole all the natural resources.<br>  <br>  There is often a debate about which colonization model is "better", British or French (because the UK and France had the bigger colonial empires.)<br>  The British model is better for the government of the colony but worse for the people because the natives were treated (more or less) like sh*t, even if usually, the Brits didn't bother with the natives and just killed them, it was more simple (example : Australia). The British tried to make colonies other countries like Britain, whereas other colonial powers like France wanted to make the natives French (even if the French were bast*rds too.)<br>  <br>  Many British people treat the French and the Germans of "colonizing imperialist bast*rds" whereas the British were by far the worst (even if the others weren't really softies.)<br>  <br>  You can only blame the colonizing countries, in your case, Britain.<br>  No country had asked the British to colonize, steal its resources, create taxes even though you can blame some countries in Africa that destroyed all infrastructures and created dictatorships after the colonization, and which 60 years later blame Britain for all their problems.|`|amcqJkWhaa	You could watch the opening scene of the movie Patton. I watched it today for the first time. It is a speech, delivered by Patton, in all his WWII uniform for a general splendor, in front of a huge American flag in the background. Patton says, Americans love to fight, and war is one of our strengths. This opening was shown in my U.S History class, and my teacher, who is a little unconventional, said the movie, and Patton himself in real life, caused much controversy from his words. He said this scene was famous. That's the only part of the movie we saw, so I can't say how well the rest does! <br>  <br>  Also, I think it was, that when people from Europe first came to America, they had to fend for theirselves, and there was a lot of struggle, disease, death, and unrest for a long time. The first shipments of people to America, came 100 or 200 years before independance was declared from Britain, and the people came in waves, with years in between. Different colonies were set up, and many didn't get along, dividing up the territories/regions over and over. So, it was that these colonists, earned their land through their struggles, and the British was pretty much a far away people, with not much influence, because when you're trying to gather food, raise children, having sewing parties, there's not much room to think about them-- possibly many wanted to get away from them. Then, perhaps because there was success in the colonies (I think maybe the British even forgot about the colonies, it was a lost venture), or some other reason-- maybe riots, maybe potential, maybe someone asked,-- Britain sent over some of it's officials to govern the colonies, and they weren't very welcome. They made their own rules when there was already a government in place, of sorts. By the way, my sister tells me, the colonists, at least some of them, wanted to be aristocratic, perhaps copy some of what the fashion was in Britain, but, they were looked down upon from the people who lived in Britain... <br>  <br>  Perfect understanding hardly ever happens, it seems, and if it does, there isn't always a way to confirm it. But I suppose each followed their own values and prospects, and I'm sure each side felt outraged at times, but I think everyone did their best, in their own way... You can find arrogance, stubbornness, misunderstanding, guilt, blame, all in one person, even if the cause of these emotions aren't so big or even make sense, when viewed by someone else. So it doesn't seem wrong to call the British arrogant, yet that seems to be too simple. The British paid, I think, for some of the voyages to the New World, and I suppose for supplies and things. Some officers were brutal, some had manners, some tried not to do too much harm (as it was necessary), some probably  felt not wholly good about what they did... it's there, just find the stories... <br>  www.thedreamercomic.com is a nice comic series, about that time period.|`|iE2sDxDAaa	In my opinion, I think British arrogance was the key factor. They treated the colonists as secondary citizens. The colonists only wanted to be treated equal...<br>  <br>  One thing lead to another and you have a revolt on your hands. Even during the war, and for some time afterward, the majority of the colonists wanted to be British citizens.|`|AA11586960	The British encouraged trade setup most of its Colonies to supply its Royal Navy with safe ports and clean water and good food and after Independence all the Colonies were in a position of self Sufficiency <br>  <br>  Until Adolf Mugabe who has raped the food Bowl of Africa Zimbabwe <br>  <br>  Independence was always on the cards and the British who did make many mistakes did Try to make amends by helping every country to Independence after WW2 India was the First and they were partial in dependant in 1947 and Full in 1952 it took Earl Mountbatten a while t set up the Indian army navy and Air force Public Servants and Police Force and the UK funded this Malaysia and Singapore was similar and  <br>  <br>  and if you look at the British colonies if the UK was so bad why did Most 99% join the commonwealth of nations and some even retained the Queen as head of state <br>  <br>  the Portuguese Germans Spanish Dutch and most of th old Colonialists have Nothing their old colonies rejoiced when they left <br>  <br>  I was in Malaysia Singapore and Bruni when they got Independence <br>  <br>  and Lee Kuan Yew, the First Prime minister  went to the UK with hat in hand and returned Jubilant at the deal offered By the UK we trained their Navy Army I helped train their Air Force <br>  <br>  The British provided Gurkha's to defend Bruni and did not close down the bases in Malaysia Singapore or Borneo until 1972   I was There <br>  <br>  the Dutch gave Irian Jaya to Indonesia the Portuguese just left East Timour to its fate and the Indonesian Military moved in and Murdered its People who wanted Independence  <br>  <br>  So having been there when some of the British colonies got Independence I believe they did A far better Job than Anyone Else and in the process made lots of Friends

VcwWw2EWaa	It's an excellent question and one that my students have asked me over the past few weeks.<br>  <br>  For another World War to happen, a number of things would have to occur. However the primary trigger for such a large scale event would result from a complete breakdown of the worlds financial and political structure. In the era of Globalization, the worlds economies have become largely interdependent of each other. One of the methods by which nations tried to recover from the first Great Depression was to adopt protectionist policies, meaning they cut themselves off from other nations economically with the idea that if governments could help their own national interests. An example of this would be a government making a law that only American cars could be purchased in America despite the fact that better, cheaper cars might be imported from elsewhere. While this might help American car companies in America, nations who had previously sold cars to America would also adopt a similar policy, perhaps not with cars, but other products as well. Thus, the economic rift between a national economies is created.<br>  <br>  However this only prolonged the economic turmoil as more and more nations adopted policies that while helping their own national interests, created a deep rift between the worlds major economies.  This helped to cause nations to drift apart economically as well as politically while at the same time leading to the rise of intense nationalism. The rise of the Nazi party in Germany is a perfect example of how this took place.<br>  <br>  So in conclusion, for this to happen, another full blown world war, you would have to see the geopolitical and economic realities of the world revert back to mid 20th century status, and in reality, we have a long long way to fall before that could happen. God willing....|`|mXUKca6naa	...it will help the economy and make room for expansion...Yes...|`|iJzIIEdfaa	Possibly.<br>  These types of wars happen every few decades to stop the world population from growing too fast. It hasn't been that long since the last one (holistically) so it will be quite a while until there is another one.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	It wouldn't surprise me.  Part of what happened to set us up for World War II was that the Great Depression was global.  Economic conditions in Germany led to the rise of Hitler.  So if similar economic conditions in troubled countries around the world also led to the rise of aggressive nationalist dictators, yes, it's possible.|`|yFKgbkWCaa	Does it look like a WW is going to occur ANYTIME soon? NO!<br>  <br>  North America is at peace, South America and Africa can't even get the attention of other people in the first place, Europe is settled down now, the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians has gone on now for over 55 years and there's been no sign of it turning into a frickin' WW. Australia is safe, nothing in Antarctica. Asia is pretty calm.<br>  <br>  The world is probably not going to experience any WW or even any major wars between two BIG countries.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	I think the multitude of Chicken Littles here on Yahoo Answers would LOVE that.  Then they could say "I told you so"!|`|AbtCfY1caa	it is the way they use to get the economy going|`|cNhQU2tOaa	Don't bet any money on it, but the natural reaction to a large-scale economic downturn on behalf of the public is a popular movement towards protectionism - limiting international free trade through taxes and tariffs so your own country can make more money and keep its jobs. This is already happening, you can watch it on TV. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, this contributes to a "zero-sum game" view of the international economy, in which our country has to defend itself against economic competitors, rather than open itself up to potential economic partners. This makes hostilities rather easier to flare up, and countries whose economic well-being is threatened get hostile a lot easier than those who are sittin fat. <br>  <br>  On top of this, when international trade recedes, we lose a natural barrier against conflict - who's gonna start a war with a trade partner? Only an idiot, that's who.<br>  <br>  This is all exactly what happened leading up to world war 1 - international trade at the turn of the 20th century was extensive and we didn't get back to that level until the late 20th century.

Qnop8tkjaa	1. Practice good hygiene. If you've got bits of food stuck in your teeth, people may indeed say you have an infectious smile, but they might be talking about actual infections. It should go without saying, but regularly brushing your teeth and making sure your breath is fresh are some prerequisites to a good smile. If your teeth are stained, visit the dentist for a polishing or use a whitening product, and take care of your lips to prevent chapping. When you smile people will inevitably look at your mouth, so following these considerations will help you make a better impression, and, more importantly, a healthy mouth will make you feel more confident about smiling.<br>     <br>        2. A smile lights up your face<br>       Get comfortable with smiling. Many people are a little nervous about smiling. They don't think their smile looks good, or they think that smiling makes them look unprofessional or vulnerable. It's true that a smile does show a little vulnerability, but that's part of what makes it so powerful. No matter how professional, intelligent, or in control you think a serious face (or worse, a frown) makes you appear, people almost always respond better to a smile.<br>     <br>     3. Think happy thoughts. The easiest way to a great smile is to be happy. You can be happy all the time, but not everybody is; when you are not, you can think happy thoughts instead. Think about something or someone that you care about, or think about a joke that you just find hilarious. Remarkably, when you're feeling down, smiling can help cheer you up, even if you have to coax a smile out at first.<br>    <br>     4. Smiles are contagious.<br>        Smile with your eyes. When we think of smiling, we think of the mouth, but the eyes may actually be more essential to a warm, genuine smile. Smiling with your eyes is difficult to describe--in general your cheekbones lift slightly and your eyebrows dip a little--but when you see it, you know it: it's that look of your eyes "lighting up" or "twinkling." To get a feel for how to make your eyes smile, get in front of a mirror and practice smiling, but concentrate only on your eyes. You may find it helpful to cover the lower part of your face with a piece of paper. Play around with it a bit, and you'll find that you can make your mouth smile when your eyes aren't smiling, and you can also smile only with your eyes. When your eyes do smile, remember how it feels, which muscles are working and how. With practice, you'll be able to smile with your eyes at will.<br>    <br>      5. Develop your smile. Don't particularly care for your smile? It's a common complaint, and while it's true that any smile is better than a frown, it's also true that some smiles look better than others. What's your best smile? One way to find out is to look through pictures of yourself. Many people who consider themselves unphotogenic are plagued by bad smiles in front of the camera, but just about everybody has at least one picture in which they just look great, with a perfectly natural, contagious smile. Find that picture and focus on what your face is doing. Then practice in front of a mirror until you get it just right. Keep practicing, and pay attention to how that great smile feels, so that you'll be able to replicate it without looking in a mirror. Soon it will become second nature, and you'll likely find that you'll look more photogenic in your next batch of pictures.<br>     6. If you want to improve your smile, look at pictures of smiles that you believe are beautiful. Also, think good thoughts and remember that you are beautiful (inside and out). Your smile is bound to look better if you feel good about yourself!<br>  <br>  <br>   Tips<br>  <br>      * You don't need perfect teeth to have a perfect smile. Not everybody has perfect teeth, and that's okay. Beautiful teeth are nice, but a great smile doesn't depend on Abercrombie & Fitch teeth. That said, if you feel uncomfortable about your teeth you may be reluctant to smile, and that's no good. If that's the case, either learn to appreciate your individuality or look into cosmetic dentistry procedures.<br>      * Begin your smile with your eyes. If you find that every time you try to smile with your mouth, you look like you're faking it or, worse, like you're in pain, you may find it useful to look in a mirror and smile only with your eyes. Once your eyes are smiling, they tend to pull your whole face (including your mouth) into a natural, beautiful smile.<br>      * You've probably heard of "contagious" or "infectious" smiles. There's a reason for this. When you smile, it does tend to make others around you smile. Even in the most stressful times, a roomful of smiles can brighten everybody's mood. Either that or make someone seriously angry at you, just because you are smiling when they are talking about someones funeral...<br>      * Ever laugh hysterically about something you've just seen? Now, think of that instance again will help fuel a full blown smile.<br>      * A lot of men feel uncomfortable about smiling|`|UPhJNCRZaa	noo,<br>  not really just theres something wrong wih your feelngs<br>  maybe when you were young you hated pixs|`|faIU064Saa	Stop taking posed shots because they *are* unnatural. Instead just have a conversation with a photographer while she is snapping away. Let her waste 100 shots to get the one that is of you smiling naturally because there is less pressure to make the shot "the right one" More candid shots where you are comfortable with the camera and the photographer is all you need.

A recent documentary series about 'contact history' between White settlers and Aboriginal people was recently released, it's called "First Australians". <br>  <br>  White settlers brought European diseases which decimated the indigenous population. The settlers and the British Govt. called Australia 'Terra Nulius', meaning unoccupied/ empty land, and did not recognise traditional land owners. Aboriginal people were forced off their land, killed in massacres, tried under British law and hung or shot for taking sheep etc. from White Settlers "properties". Many were rounded up and put in reservations run by missions. <br>  <br>  Very similar story to what happened to First Nations people in the U.S.|`|72LvOwEhaa	<a href="http://givinginfo.reads.it" rel="nofollow">http://givinginfo.reads.it</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.

Poetry should be crafted to appeal to the reader's senses and emotions as well as convey meaning. Be more creative with your vocabulary and experiment with figurative language (metaphors, personification, etc.) as well as sound qualities (rhythm) to see what conveys your point most effectively. Keep in mind that the whole should be more than the sum of it's parts, as the saying goes. Good luck with your poem and your friend! :)|`|l195kTc6aa	I think it's great, it made me sad...

One thing I would change are the descriptions after each dialogue that describe how the words are said (like "I retorted" and "she spat at me"). Used sparingly, they can be effective, but it's usually enough just to have the dialogue stand-alone when the speaker can be inferred. Too many of them just reminds me of those awful Twilight novels. Otherwise, your story sounds great. I like the choice of name for Byrdie! :)
SHNYP6Xpaa	Man I hate doing other people's homework, so I'm not going to give you the direct answer, I'm gonna make you learn stuff.<br>  <br>  Mao's cultural revolution was to bring China out of the old traditional world and promote his ideal Communist country. The effect uprooted capitalism and slowed down the economy of China making it a totalitarian communist regime. Change came quickly through forced indoctrination of the people and the elimination of all western influences and capitalism. In the process, Mao is believed to have murdered between 25 and 50 million of his own people in order to purge western influences and traditional Chinese culture.<br>  <br>  Cuba was also a communist country, with heavy ties to the Soviet Union. In April 1961, Americans landed in Cuba in an attempt to cause rebels to stage a coup against Castro, the coup failed. This was known as the Bay of Pigs Invasion and happened several months before the Cuban Missile Crisis. In October of 1961 an American U-2 spy plane, located and photographed several Soviet missile installations causing a frightening sequence of events that nearly lead the US and the USSR to go into a full scale nuclear conflict.

This has nothing to do with philosophy, except with the logic that supernatural spiritualism is possible, and the metaphysics that it exists.<br>  <br>  This kind of enlightenment is random, unreliable, and a waste of time if you plan to sit around and wait "to become" enlightened.<br>  <br>  Mohandas Ghandi is believed by the ignorant (no perjorative meant; I mean literal ignorance) to be "enlightened," but the truth is he was an extremely educated man who applied his education to his beliefs; or maybe he applied his beliefs to his education. If this is what you mean, then we are not talking "supernatural spiritualism" at all; we are talking about Enlightenment. Ghandi was Enlightened.<br>  <br>  The last generation of human who were of the Enlightenment were America's Founding Fathers. Certainly there have been Enlightened men and women since then, but as an entire generation, they were the last.<br>  <br>  So you know what Enlightenment did; it helped humanity by asserting the rights of men; by upholding justice, dignity, and individual sovereignty. It established modern science, and re-established Naturalism, relegating religious doctrine to its former place as the skeptical position of Naturalism. (That piece of history goes all the way back to St. Augustine, so you can see how much history the Enlightenment is responsible for having reversed.)<br>  <br>  The loss of Enlightenment through the 20 or so decades since America's founding has led to the reversal--again--of the rise of Augustinian metaphysics and logic. It is what is wrong with out world today. <br>  <br>  Perhaps Augustine was somehow enlightened; but he was certainly not Enlightened.<br>  <br>  I don't claim to be too Enlightened, but I'm learning.

cR8UZdi1aa	You can get some tracing paper & trace over your caricature over & over again until you get him just right. If you just want to be able to draw the same caricature each time, tracing him will help you do that. Most people won't be able to duplicate even their own work more then once exactly. subtle changes is okay, it actually gives your caricature life & personality if he's not drawn exactly the same each time.<br>  <br>  You also might want to make a grid. Place grid paper or do your own grid outline on tracing paper & lay it over your drawing. Then on a separate grid paper, draw each square as you see it, copy it. this will help you to learn the features & placements of your caricature & will be easier for you to duplicate it.

Figure out which of these motions/movements are going to be used the most and do some finalized drawings of them. This would go for body and facial motions/movements. If you're using ink or colored pencils, I would create a palette of the colors and their names, with notes about the areas of the character they will be used.<br>  <br>  Trace (use tracing paper) over your original character drawing and slowly build up motions/movements with tracing overlays -- like a flip book or animation. It might take you a wee bit of time, but you'll be able to figure out your characters gradual motions/movements with each overlay of tracing paper. When you figure out the motions/movements, use carbon paper to draw out your character on your board or drawing paper.<br>  <br>  I understand what you're going through. If you're building a portfolio for a publisher, they want to see that you can create illustrations that flow with the same characters throughout a book. It just takes a little time, constant sketching, and practice to do it over and over again.

OR it came about when the using the big bang theory.|`|0YT04B43aa	chicken( from a religious perspective)<br>  egg from (Darwinism)|`|gLp7pvPnaa	The chicken evolved from an egg-like cell, as did we all.|`|EuEHwLLSaa	The real answer, (if you don't believe in gods) is the egg.<br>  The gradual evolution of a creature we wouldn't exactly call a chicken.<br>   One/a few of these creatures lay eggs, with a slightly different gene systems, and will keep reproducing, the new gene systems getting stronger with each generation, essentially changing the species until one of the eggs contains what we would call a chicken, either the gene system of the chicken will grow stronger and produce a species or die out and be classed as a mutant. <br>  Since we have chickens in existence today, the chicken gene system grew stronger. <br>  <br>  The egg comes before the chicken, in an evolutionists point of view.<br>  <br>  If you believe in god, then yeah, god created chickens and then the chickens laid eggs.|`|XfSJZCEyaa	For those that say this is a creationism vs evolution question is certainly wrong.<br>  <br>  They say creationism is when God creates the chicken while Evolution is when the embryo in the egg evolves into chicken...<br>  <br>  Is it also not possible for God to create just an egg and have it hatch? Why is creationism always linked to creation of an animal when God in His description, can create anything? <br>  Would He not be able to incubate the very first egg with his energy?|`|P9vPjQAtaa	This question appears regularly in the question file, so let's take a shot at it.<br>  <br>  In nature, living things evolve through changes in their DNA. In an animal like a chicken, DNA from a male sperm cell and a female ovum meet and combine to form a zygote -- the first cell of a new baby chicken. This first cell divides innumerable times to form all of the cells of the complete animal. In any animal, every cell contains exactly the same DNA, and that DNA comes from the zygote.<br>  <br>  Chickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. That one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken.<br>  <br>  Prior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is the only place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal, and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg. SO THE EGG MUST HAVE COME FIRST!|`|QZFRxZamaa	All life started in water, we slowly evolved...and one day we had chickens, the chicken was fertile...reproduced and layed an egg...<br>  Therefore, the chicken came first...Its scientifically proven.<br>  It depends if you believe in evolution...which in christianity they don't.......<br>  Jews and Muslims believe in evolution and all science for that matter :)|`|Wh8APeXMaa	The egg.<br>  <br>  Because the chicken evolved from another species; therefore at a certain point, its immediate ancestor was not a chicken. <br>  <br>  However, that ancestor would still have begun its life in an egg.|`|M6uIbKXRaa	it depends if u believe in god the chicken if u don't and this is a trick question then neither its an unsolvable mystery|`|gyn3J1xIaa	the egg. where else would a chicken come from? all things begin as something simple.|`|KKWSmZFeaa	chiken|`|de551650e182d2c31b2a3a540b7f7874aa	life Creight's the conditions in order to exist|`|7pM7MbCDaa	both ... lol<br>  well i will ask a question could help you in you t find the answer ??<br>  WHO COME FIRST STUDENT OR TEACHER ????
bP5zyipXaa	it means you are pro choice , you support that option even though you wouldnt do it yourself  it means you are more open minded to realize that even though that option might not not be best for you that other people should have it|`|8ekoa6szaa	That makes you pro-choice and I couldn't agree with you more.  I, too, could never have an abortion, but I certainly support a woman's right to choose to have one.  I don't believe in abortion as an alternative means of birth control, but I remember the days when abortion was illegal and the women who died self-aborting because they couldn't afford another child or, as was the case of a woman from Arizona, who wanted to have an abortion because she had had German measles, but could not have the abortion because they were still illegal at that time.  I believe she ended up going to Sweden to have it--a very unnecessary expense.  I also seem to remember the fetus being deformed once it was aborted and examined.|`|NzP09sGdaa	I agree but my view would probably fall under the definition of "anarchist" rather than merely "pro-choice". The whole purpose of man-made law, near as I can tell, is to give lawmakers the ability to argue "It's only right when it is done for reasons I, myself have done/might do it.". <br>  <br>  Abortion, war, execution, torture, lying, extortion, bribery, theft, crimes against humanity etc..it's all the same. When lawmakers do these things, they are given different names but they are the same. You can't get milk from a brick by calling it a cow...errr...well... I've never actually tried that but I'm pretty sure it doesn't work.<br>  <br>  edit: Happy Hiram gets my vote!|`|rcPnnfmmaa	You believe women should have that choice, even if you would not make that choice yourself. You are pro-choice. Many pro-choice people think this way.|`|g6bBORHxaa	That would make you like me. Probably more into the category of Pro-choice. I don't think abortions are right but I do believe you can't push your beliefs on other people, especially through law. Pro-life is just another way in which religions try to force their morals into law and therefore on to everyone. Theres a reason theres a separation between church and state.|`|f4126b0baa297b82a91a07ad7af89bd0aa	that would make u pro-choice. You personal choice does not reflect the bills our government trys to pass to stop or continue abortion<br>  <br>  I am in the same boat as u, I would never get an abortion, but i believe a women has her choice on keeping the child or not. Its not fair to a child to be born into a family that never wanted it, or a family of lower income or into a society of drug/violence/etc. That child does not deserve that kind of life, that child's probability to make the same mistakes, have mental issues, etc from those things are pretty high. <br>  <br>  Sometimes, another child in this world is not a blessing, but a burden, b/c it won't get the love and nurchering that it needs, to grow into a healthy man or women. Foster homes are terrible to be in, (from exp.) you never get the full love u want, nad most the time u are used for farm work or other labor :(....|`|pbaUAznbaa	You are pro-choice.

Even if it's a bit to concentrated in expressions that I might think are a bit forced: "a figure free of imperfection" / "for from selfishness seeds discontent" / "fragmented confrontation" / "given to us by the mighty before" / "forever meant for them, your definition eternally thought of as abhor", - a bit of polish won't do any harm for its basic idea.<br>  <br>  Also, regarding the aesthetic shape of the poem you should maintain a specific personal rule on the verses - the mix between long and short verses is not well created here.

Simply because the Greeks influenced the Romans so much that to the extent when Rome was in decline, the East Roman Empire was more Greek than Roman hence the term Byzantine Empire.<br>  <br>  The Romans inturn influenced Renaissance Europe, which in turn influenced later Europe etc. Thus many British who were educated studied the classics etc.<br>  <br>  If you are speaking than in more than the list, then I would say Greeks and Romans influenced the Western world.

V2v66A7Waa	The middle splits are the hardest to get because the shape of your hip bones may make it physically impossible to do a completely flat split. If this is the case, you can only get to a certain point before you really can't get any more flexible.<br>  <br>  My favorite stretch for the middle splits is to lie down on your back next to a wall with your legs up on the wall. Scoot up next to the wall until your hips touch it. Then open your legs as far as you can in a split position, and relax. Hold it for a few minutes (I advise no more than 3 minutes). Gravity will gradually pull your legs down.<br>  <br>  It is very important that you always stretch after you have already warmed up. If you stretch while your muscles are cold, it is very easy to pull a muscle, and then you'll build scar tissue which does not stretch very well at all. Do this stretch after a practice or after exercising.<br>  <br>  It's also important to hold a deep stretch for at least 30-60 seconds in order to increase your flexibility. When you stretch a muscle, it automatically responds by tightening - this is known as "stretch reflex." When you do a long-sustained stretch, the muscle eventually stops resisting and allows itself to be lengthened.<br>  <br>  Finally, never "bounce" in a stretch, as this only increases the stretch reflex and makes it more likely that you will tear a muscle. The best way to stretch for increasing flexibility is simply to hold a stretch for at least 30-60 seconds, but no more than about 3 minutes.|`|WrzgiVyYaa	I guess u will have to find a diffrent routine to train your body to do it or ask your doctor lol. I naturally can do the splits so i dont know much about it but my some of my friends in my dance class didnt know how and they just keep stretching and trying to do them until they got it right<br>  <br>  hope i helped :/ lol|`|orOBP900aa	If others in your class don't have their right and left splits yet, it sounds like you're young and you still have time to get your middle splits, don't worry. I didn't have mine for five years, but I stretched every day and I got them this year. Don't worry if you never get them, everyone's built differently.|`|Ht7F5vATaa	some people can never get down in the splits, even though they have been dancing for years. it just depends on how your muscles are made. however since you can get down in your other splits and you say that your joint is hurting when you try, i don't think that the former case applies for you. Are you turning out when you are doing it (are your knees facing the ceiling). If not that is your problem. the hip joint physically cannot do the center splits unless the hip has rotated in the socket. Remember, pain is not normal for any stretch exercise, although you will feel a stretch. (obviously) if this still doesn't work try this. Sit against a wall (facing it) and do center splits against the wall (try to put your groin on the wall. Have some one put their back on yours and push you in. Hold it and then go further. remember knees to ceiling and back straight. repeat 6 times. then relax. .  stretch it out doing butterfly/frog or chest on knees stretch. continue doing this stretch  multiple times a week until you can go down in center.have fun and good luck.|`|rY6wfebpaa	Whoa, that description of bone against bone does not sound too good! <br>  Be proud of yourself that you're able to do a left and right split, all the same.<br>  Middle splits depends a lot on the sideways flexibility of your hips, which is why it seems that wider hip-boned girls seem to do them quite easily whilst being hopeless at front splits. My suggestion would be to amp up the training (gently to begin with, of course, and warm up THOROUGHLY).<br>  1) work on sitting in middle splits outside of class. Just go as far as you can and sit there, ideally for over a minute. Time yourself, because you tend to overestimate time when doing something a bit uncomfortable.<br>  2) Pilates does wonders for your body, a combination of strength and flexibility. <br>  3) Attempt a pancake, or forward roll, or froggy, or whatever it's called where you are. Spread your legs as widely as is comfortable and be careful not to curve your bum up towards your tummy in the effort to spread wider. Make sure your butt bones are seated firmly on the floor and bend forward as far as is comfortable. <br>  These things do not work overnight, but they do help.<br>  All the best.

vsy4QMHMaa	mamianka e-mailed me with a request to comment on your question. <br>  <br>  The live matinee broadcast is not the first time the piece is performed. I expect that the met records or rehearses recording the operas several times before the broadcast. Guaranteed there are a few seconds of mandatory "tape delay" in the feed sent to theaters On a re-broadcast (encore) they may "fix" some of the clunky camera work that was evident in the first act. Seems like the camera mount was bumped by someone at least twice during close ups and some zoom-ins went a bit too far and they had to pull back again. That kind of thing. I think they would do those edits with images taken from another camera angel during the same performance.<br>  <br>  The "cute" stuff like Marcello Giordani carrying Patricia Racette to the interview right after the first ACT I the setting up for Act III (Patricia's "Cher hair" comment while searching for her braid) ... all of that and the 15 minute intermissions looking out over the pit and into the hall verify that the program is live. (Did you see the guy with the bright turquoise shirt ... down near the front, stage right ... during the second intermission?) <br>  <br>  [Edit: Oh yes, and my daughter reminded me of all the audience coughing for the first five minutes.]<br>  <br>  [Edit 2: and Cho-Cho San's missed fan flip at the beginning while she makes her way to the front of the stage.]<br>  <br>  ... and what about that puppetry with "Sorrow"? My God that was good! <br>  <br>  The only recorded parts you saw yesterday were the stills from a previous production, the edits of the interview with Anthony Minghella (1954-1008), adverts for the future performances and the upcoming MET Auditions.|`|sc4BtGxGaa	When you attend the Met, you are TOLD if it is a performance that is going to be taped.  Last week, I was at Il Trovatore, which was taped for FUTURE broadcast.  Reduced ticket???? You HAVE to be kidding!  <br>  <br>  In time, these live performances are edited, etc. Heads in front of the camera?  Sounds like a cheap pirate movie!  I go to the Met live, and and they do not show these in theaters near us (because we live close by) so I cannot comment on the production quality.  I DO know that you can get these streamed from the website, for a fee - and they say THOSE are the same ones you see in theaters.  I have not connected all my cables yet - I bought everything, and then had a injury, surgery, rehab - I'll get around to it.<br>  <br>  Did you see this in a theater?  TV?  Computer?  It puzzles me that anything of other than GREAT quality would be allowed out for public viewing - I will ask around, and see what I can find.<br>  <br>  Added - I emailed the Leaderboard Leader in Classical, who had a question posted about this - he watched it, and he is very knowlegeable. I hope he writes in to you - he is I.Jones.

LeMBw51Aaa	First off you can not paint on finished plates and use them for food. The only way you can do this is on bisque, preferably stone ware. The best place to contact is Placid Ceramics. They are in Washington Pa. Phone number (724) 225 6778. If they can not provide you with bisque stone ware I am sure they will know where.<br>  When you buy green ware from a ceramic shop (not been fired yet) you pay for the slip and 10% of the cost of the mold new. i.e. 1 Qt of slip is lets say $1, the mold cost $50 new, your piece will cost you $6. When it is fired the first time it is another 10% of the mold. If you want it food safe you must use under glaze paint. This is paint designed to be fired to set it to the piece.<br>  Once the paint is set it must be over glazed, you must use a lead free glaze. (food safe). remember, each time you fire it, it is another10%.    <br>  For your party you can have the bisque plates and the under glaze paint ready. Once the paint is dry it needs fired again. The food safe glaze can now be applied, and once dried fired for the last time. Your plates are now food safe.|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	Bisque is after the first firing, the process changes the clay from mud to stone basically. It is dull and porous because it has not been finished with the second process - glazing. A glazed plate is shiny and non porous. You can't use underglaze on a finished plate, and without firing bisque it will not be sealed and safe. Nothing else is food safe. I'd just go for something else. Too much trouble.

And, in an agrarian society, you still need to process the things you grow--you need textile mills, lumber mills, etc.  They're not doing mass production like the factories in the north were, but these were necessary businesses for an agrarian society.|`|VBdXray0aa	Agriculture.

They were centers of commerce, business and government. What was New York City like before the invention of railroads, assembly lines, and interchangeable parts?  Charleston, SC, Atlanta, GA, Charlotte, NC, New Orleans, LA and many other southern cities were crossroads where farmers and plantation owners could meet with buyers, shippers, brokers, and suppliers, and each other to discuss ways to improve yields, profits, and quality of life.  Just like they did in London, Paris, and Rome, as well as Chicago, San Francisco, and Boston.
9iElNpSSaa	The Vandoren B45 and 5RV are excellent mouthpieces for students.  They are also used by some professional players.  Also, Richard Hawkins makes a student mouthpiece which is a little more expensive than the Vandorens, but is excellent.<br>  It’s a good idea to order a few mouthpieces and try them out to select the one you like the best.  A few online stores have a trial policy -- Weiner Music and also Woodwind and Brasswind.  That’s a good option because you can play them in your own home or practice room without any distractions.  Remember that no two mouthpieces are the same, so you have to play on them first to see what works for you.<br>  Also, when trying out new mouthpieces, use new reeds, not the ones you have been playing on your old mouthpiece.  The old reeds will have changed shape slightly to match your old mouthpiece and won’t give you a fair perspective of how the new mouthpiece plays.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6SwaWSoyaa	The Vandoren B45 is a decent mouthpiece but it is rather expensive.<br>  Check out the 5RV Lyre.<br>  If you want something good, but not expensive go out and look at the Selmer brands, but even then we are talking about begginer band style.<br>  A wooden moutpiece is nice and all, but it is soaking in a lot of moisture that isn't good for it. Check out hard rubber moutpieces. Go to your local store and ask them to try out many different moutpieces because it is different for everybody.<br>  <br>  good luck with your search

1hvrQYWiaa	Marshall Aid was the American plan to help rebuild Europe economically after WW2,while at the same time keeping the American economy producing at wartime levels even though the war was over. The overall aim of giving this aid was to prevent a communist takeover of the whole of Europe.Both France and Italy had large communist parties, and with the Red Army occupying all of Eastern Europe and part of Germany,this was seen as a very real possibility by the Americans.It is so called because President Truman put General Marshall in charge.<br>   The aid was not given in cash - that would have been no help to the US economy.Instead, individual countries were asked what materials or manufactures they needed to help rebuild their economies - fuel, food, tractors and so on - and then the Americans sent these over to them as aid (the countries didn't have to pay for these things).<br>   Stalin rejected Marshall Aid, which was offered to the Eastern Bloc countries and USSR, for3 main reasons.The first was ideological.By offering capitalist economic aid to communist countries,the USA would be undermining communism in these countries.The second reason was geostrategic; these countries might become allies of USA because they were grateful for their help, and to ensure it kept coming. This would undermine the Russian military strategic position in Europe (not only Truman thought in terms of a dominoe theory).Finally, by accepting Marshall Aid the communist countries would realize USA was strong, rich, and therefore powerful - not the impression Stalin wanted these satellite countries to have of America.|`|b620ee9ffe6252c90305858258e1bd65aa	The plan<br>  <br>  On 12th March, 1947, Harry S. Truman, announced details to Congress of what eventually became known as the Truman Doctrine. In his speech he pledged American support for "free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures". This speech also included a request that Congress agree to give military and economic aid to Greece in its fight against communism. <br>  <br>  Three months later George C. Marshall, Truman's Secretary of State, announced details of what became known as the Marshall Plan or the European Recovery Program (ERP). Marshall offered American financial aid for a programme of European economic recovery. Ernest Bevin, the British foreign secretary, made it clear he fully supported the scheme but the idea was rejected by the Soviet Union. A conference was held in Paris in September and sixteen nations in Western Europe agreed on a four year recovery plan. <br>  <br>  On 3rd April, 1948, Harry S. Truman signed the first appropriation bill authorizing $5,300,000,000 for the first year of the ERP. Paul G. Hoffman was appointed as head of the Organization for Economic Cooperation (OEEC) administration and by 1951 was able to report that industrial production in Western Europe had grown 30 per cent since the beginning of the Second World War. <br>  <br>  The European Recovery Program came to an end on 31st December, 1951. It its three year existence, the ERP spent almost $12,500,000,000. It was succeeded by the Mutual Security Administration. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAmarshallP.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USA...</a><br>  Stalin<br>  Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's response to the Marshall Plan was to ban the Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe from receiving US aid. When the Czech government showed interest in the Marshall Plan, Stalin ordered them to refuse the offer. Stalin feared that US businesses would be able to take over industries in Eastern Europe, threatening Soviet control. Stalin and the Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov were heavily critical of the Marshall Plan, and saw it as a threat to the USSR. To show that the USSR could help its satellite states in the absence of Marshall Aid, Comecon was set up in 1949. <br>  <br>  <br>  The Marshall Plan marked another stage in the development of the Cold War. In 1945, at the Yalta Conference and Potsdam Conference, the USA and USSR had agreed to the concept of spheres of influence. However, neither side felt that the other had adhered to its promises. The Soviets regarded the Marshall Plan as evidence of US intention to dominate the whole of Europe; the USA saw Soviet insistence that the nations of Eastern Europe refuse US aid as proof of Stalin's dictatorial hand. After 1945 the two former wartime allies moved ever further apart, and the Marshall Plan became an element of this separation. <br>  <br>  <br>  Aside from the immediate benefits of the Marshall Plan for those involved, there were also important longer-term effects – the plan's architects consciously promoted European integration. The Program stimulated new forms of European cooperation through the OEEC, intra-European trade, and the European Payments Union, forerunner of the European Monetary System. These measures helped foster moves towards integration that led to the creation of the European Community, later called the European Union. The growth of cooperation between European countries, coupled with US engagement, also facilitated the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Marshall+aid+plan" rel="nofollow">http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Marshall+...</a>
ceBTTCPwaa	A Separate Peace is John Knowles' first published novel, released in 1959.<br>  <br>  The Threat of Codependency to Identity ~ The central relationship in the novel—that between Finny and Gene—involves a complex dynamic of seeking to establish, yet being uncomfortable with, identity. Early in the book, the boys' relationship seems fueled, in part, by Gene's envy and resentment of his friend's dominating spirit. As Finny demonstrates his physical prowess, Gene feels the need to accentuate his academic prowess. Finny's fall from the tree, however, apparently purges Gene of his darker feelings and steers their relationship in a different direction so that codependency rather than envy characterizes it. The scene immediately following the fall symbolizes this evolution, as Gene dresses in Finny's clothes and sees himself as looking exactly like him. From this point on, he and Finny come to depend on each other for psychological support. Gene plays sports because Finny cannot, allowing Finny to train him to be the athlete that Finny himself cannot be. This training seems an avenue for Finny simply to live vicariously through Gene. But Gene actively welcomes this attempt by Finny, for just as Finny derives inner strength from fulfilling his dreams through Gene, so, too, does Gene find happiness in losing his own self (which he seems to dislike) in Finny's self (which he likes very much). Thus, the boys' relationship becomes a model of codependency, with each feeding off of, and becoming fulfilled by, the other. This codependency preempts the development of their individual identities, perhaps dangerously: by living within their own private illusion that World War II is a mere conspiracy and continuing to believe that Gene (and Finny through him) will go to the Olympics and that the outside world can never curtail their dreams, the boys are refusing to grow up and develop their own ambitions and responsibilities. Not even Finny's death, though it separates them physically, can truly untangle Gene's identity from Finny's—he feels as though Finny's funeral is his own. In a sense, the reader realizes, the funeral is indeed Gene's own; so much of him is merged with Finny that it is difficult to imagine one boy continuing to exist without the other. It is perhaps only his ultimate understanding that Finny alone had no enemy that allows the older Gene to reestablish a separate identity—one that he considers, however, inferior to Finny's.<br>   <br>  The Creation of Inner Enemies ~ A Separate Peace takes place during wartime and is emphatically a novel about war—and yet not a single shot is fired in the course of the story, no one dies in battle, and only the unfortunate Leper even joins the military before graduation. Instead, Knowles focuses on the war within the human heart, a war that is affected by the events of World War II but exists independently of any real armed conflict. For Knowles—or at least for his narrator, Gene—every human being goes to war at a certain point in life, when he or she realizes that the world is a fundamentally hostile place and that there exists in it some enemy who must be destroyed. The novel implicitly associates this realization of the necessity of a personal war with adulthood and the loss of childhood innocence. For most of Gene's classmates, World War II provides the catalyst for this loss, and each reacts to it in his own way—Brinker by nurturing a stance of bravado, for example, and Leper by descending into madness.<br>  Gene himself, though, states that he fought his own war while at Devon and killed his enemy there. The obvious implication is that Finny, as the embodiment of a spirit greater than Gene's own, was his enemy, casting an unwavering shadow over Gene's life. One might alternatively interpret Gene's statement to mean that this enemy was himself, his own resentful, envious nature, which he “killed” either by knocking Finny from the tree or by obtaining forgiveness from Finny for doing so. In either case, the overall theme is clear: all humans create enemies for themselves and go to war against them. Everyone, that is, except Finny, the champion of innocence, who refuses to believe that anyone could be his enemy. In a sense, Finny's death is inevitable: his innocence makes him too good for the war-torn and inimical world in which the rest of humanity lives.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/A_Separate_Peace" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/A_Separate_Peace</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/asp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/asp/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/separate/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/separate/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-168.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/aseparatepeace/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/aseparatepeace...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmSeparatePeace02.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/Titles/separate" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/sepeace.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a>
1404d9070bb3e8dbdfa989926c402b0eaa	Pam Houston<br>  The story is in a collection called "Cowboys Are My Weakness"<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cowboys-Are-My-Weakness-UK/dp/1853815985/ref=ed_oe_h" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Cowboys-Are-My-Wea...</a><br>  "In "Blizzard Under Blue Sky", which perhaps is the most poetic and dazzling, the young woman is diagnosed as clinically depressed. She claims it was a result of "work that wasn't getting done, bills that weren't getting paid, and a man I'd given my heart to weekending in the desert with his ex." Instead of drugs and psychotherapy she turns to nature to heal her wounds, to "fix her machine." She takes off with her two dogs and spends the night in a snow cave, she pushes herself to her limits "
b85d85999255d4f6f91c3214b8669be5aa	Probablemente, no.  Dos personas idénticas no se complementan y pronto comenzarían las diferencias, estoy seguro de ello.|`|73095cb2f2fed479ea17e596616f2f2eaa	Me parece una pregunta muy interesante. No creo que sea capaz de decir si me llevaría bien con mi clon o no, porque las relaciones humanas a veces son un tanto complicadas. Y bueno, por experiencia sé que me he llevado muy bien con gente que era complementaria a mí y también me he llevado bien con gente que se me parecía mucho, así que creo que debería esperar a que me clonen y luego ya os cuento la historia.|`|20d6c015b803dd1e49e54896ee475b94aa	?Sería increíble! Mis hermanos son mellizos y se llevan genial. A mí también me gustaría tener a alguien con quien compartir un montón de cosas.|`|13cfcf58086afce1a77ebc12e57e28b4aa	No creo que me llevara muy bien, siempre queriendo llevar razón, imagínate que discusiones.|`|1861e742e6208d91edabb410a1d7cf51aa	Quizá me gustaría tener un clon, porque los gemelos se llevan muy bien y son casi clones. Aunque por otro lado, no sé si aguantaría alguien como yo. Al principio sería divertido pero quién sabe… quizá no me gustaría verle lavándose los dientes con mi cepillo.|`|661e51defe1acd65ad8e80aa29c9eea8aa	Yo creo que si, como nos ibamos a molar las mismas cosas nos pasaríamos muy bien.|`|1c12936633e43caf3be64a0480c5c434aa	A mí sí que me gustaría tener un clon, seríamos como hermanos: compartiríamos piso, bromearíamos con la gente haciendo que uno pasara por otro… Y bueno, le haría ir a mi trabajo y contestar al teléfono cuando llamara mi ex mujer (algo bueno tendrá que tener tener un clon, no?).|`|2ae01423ddcbbb8fd14615986c3238e1aa	Creo que es genial para los que están enamorados de sí mismos.|`|8f87cac71d56a6177ed66bc32acaf5e2aa	Bueno, imagino que podría llevarme bien con mi clon, aunque quizás sería un poco complicado y acabaríamos cansándonos de saber ya nuestros pensamientos, porque conoceríamos ya nuestros secretos y nuestro pasado. También explicarle a la gente esta nueva situación sería un poco complicado, ?imagina pedirle al jefe dos nóminas! Mi doble tendría que conseguir un trabajo. Y bueno, con mi novia también habría un poco de lío, pero imagino que nos acabaríamos llevando bien.|`|95ff7800e452edb0eea34c57109eef9baa	No creo que me llevara bien con él, porque tendría que intentar arreglar mi vida por duplicado, además, hay a veces que no me aguanto ni yo mismo… Imagina tener otro como yo.|`|adfeb2a7a125271197b5c358da1849fbaa	Creo que sería un poco complicado coincidir siempre al 100% con una persona que seas tú mismo, porque es cierto que de primeras tendríamos los mismos pensamientos, pero luego se empezarían a bifurcar y cada uno pensaría cosas diferentes. En realidad no sabría si vamos a acabar pensando que el otro es un idiota.|`|c481432b34a92be824b8392196345b95aa	Como tener la misma codificación genética no es todo a la hora de desarrollar la personalidad, DEPENDE: de el ambiente en que tu clon crezca, en el que tú hayas crecido, en las aficiones en común que compartáis y el hecho de que posiblemente él te odie por jugar a ser dios y haberlo creado. Ten cuidado, no vaya a querer sustituirte muhahahaha|`|e1a998275faab25edd6275b432c3a264aa	Está claro que no tiene por qué. A parte de los genes que componen nuestro ADN tenemos incorporados MEMES que no son resultado de experimento científico alguno.<br>  Luego está la educación que recibas de parte de tus padres que, aunque sea el mismo hijo, variará por completo.<br>  Así que, categóricamente, aunque seas tú dos veces puedes ser un capullo de impresión.

eca735eb563a6a25bedeef0050127389aa	Smithsonian Deputy Director of Archives Eugene Randall cites quatrain # 243 as an indication of Obama's presence in the codex. In my opinion, it is iffy. The great empire might mean China or Russia. Strictly speaking, Obama is not "from slaves come", but it is an interesting quatrain.<br>  <br>  243<br>  The great empire will be torn from limb,<br>  The all-powerful one for more than four hundred years:<br>  Great power given to the dark one from slaves come,<br>  The Aryana will not be satisfied thereby.|`|2i5GWxUdaa	The guy has been president for a month, he is not a god, and hasn't yet proved himself as a "Great Leader".

It's funny how they never manage to find these prophecies BEFORE an event happens...
amcqJkWhaa	Yes I think you could do more darker shading on the lips, also make it more textured. <br>  And it seems the pupil in your drawing is slightly more centered and looking at the viewer, than in the picture. You have too much white of the eye on the right of the pupil. <br>  I also think you could draw his clumps of hair more arched in their curves... perhaps this could make it appear more sculpture like and less natural? (the original picture is pretty stiffly hair-sprayed)<br>  And it seems you could do more work on the shoulder and the clothes... these are my thoughts to improve your drawing. You have the curve of the arm kinda skewed. Also it seems you may have the shoulder slightly low set. And you can make the vest more thick and stiff... <br>  Oh, and I've just now noticed the forehead. The hair on his forehead doesn't create such a peak as you have shown. And I think the placement of the peak of the triangle the hair clumps make on the forehead, is also not in alignment with the original picture. It's possible placing it slightly more to the right would be more accurate. <br>  Also, even though you said there isn't many shadows on his face because of the overexposure technique, I still think you can darken the shadow in the area between his nose and eye and eyebrow. I think you can work on that more...  get that right. Oh yeah, and there is some slight shades and tones on his face, that are subtle but they're there... like the way the colors of his cheek gradually become lighter, or darker, because of the volume of his cheek. His face isn't blankly white... you have done some shading on his forehead I see, but that doesn't really make it complete, yet. <br>  <br>  And are you planning to work on the shading of the hair more? I feel putting more highlights will further enhance your rendering. <br>  And his cranium seems lopsided because you didn't... well at the top left of your picture, you filled out the hair, when really they're just strands/clumps that stick out-- you can see the background painting through them. Oh, jeez, and look at the top of your picture guy's head. You've got the high forehead there, but the hair on the top of his skull must be really pressed down, because the peak of his forehead seem to be almost level with the top of the hair! <br>  <br>  But anyhow, good job. But maybe his black eye shadow can look a little less glossy. : ) I thought he was a girl.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	It really is quite good. The hair's done pretty well, and hair is hard (I think). The original picture doesn't have much of it, but I would add a little more facial definition in the drawing - just a little more shading around the nose and the eye. That will help the neck seem less unnatural for being shaded darker. <br>  <br>  As for the background, I would leave it light (although, not white). <br>  <br>  Good work.|`|qsOzFNU8aa	You seem to be well on your way, but be sure to add more shadow to the nostrils and lips, they need to be as dark or darker than the shad around the eyes. Also, darken the hair at the roots. If you have a pointed eraser, make highlights in the hair with it. DON'T be afraid to shade! Good luck!|`|u0JCNh8zaa	You have talent.  I would leave the emphasis on the object like you have now.  I took 4 years of art and wish I had 1/2 your talent.  But, I am sure anything you decide to put in the background is going to be fabulous anyway.  Please update when you get finished, I would really like to see your finished product.|`|BSqDYs1eaa	that is brilliant and i am being serious wish i could draw like that you have a great talent mate make sure you use it wisely|`|Uagg9UsFaa	Wow, that's really good, but I think you need to make the upper lip a little bit bigger. It's really quite to scale with the lower one, but other than that, it's really good in my opinion.|`|1qWAWQnFaa	I think it's great! I think once you finish the bottom you'll be super happy with it! Your really talented!|`|VodSyMZIaa	You are very talented.  I think maybe just soften the chin a little.  But you should keep drawing.|`|LnB9U8Fbaa	amazing, the hair looks so real!|`|qTqjlHDtaa	AMAZINGG!! the only possible thing i could say is put more detail on the clothing on the girl. BUT GREAT PICTUREE!!:)|`|9M8WY2vJaa	it is great|`|ta1d1wjEaa	it's hot lil more detail tho..|`|MFAMzb6waa	that is a excellent drawing but who is it?|`|nnN4QDgkaa	well i draw also and i think that you should put a background in it like a forest or a room in a house or anything you come up with cause i drew Eminem and i left the background blank and it looked really good shaded so if you need help email me ok|`|CHHIePqeaa	whats holding you back man thats great <br>  <br>  i suggest you pursue a career as an artist , remember if someone turns you down,,, don't give up !|`|HzydW6Uyaa	THAT IS AN AWESOME PICTURE YO!  The clothing could use a little more color and shading but other than that it's tight yo!|`|yxqMBDLwaa	WOW> that picture is awsome. Great Job! the only thing that doesnt look good r the rocks on the shirt. mayb u can draw them a little bit better|`|9Xt3UpB1aa	I say keep going in the direction your heading in, it looks amazing to me!|`|EV80V2Kraa	clothes need more shading, detail.  Otherwise it's very nice.
AA12071271	there is no real security, there is no way to ensure life wont come crashing down on you. only fools face life with complete confidence. but what other choice do we have? no matter what we do, life is going to bash us. the only other alternative is to move on with life. life is going to screw us badly anyway, our only choice is to expect and accept it|`|85G971RLaa	Confidence is usually born of having a set of core values and principles in which you yourself live by.  Your standards of living is what drives you to continue to live your life.<br>  Deep in the essence of us all, we have accepted that there is no real security, and that life in and of itself is organized chaos and we move about in suspended animation to avoid that lack of security.  Indeed many move forward looking forward to the challenges of the day, month, years, lifetime giving them a false sense of control in the process.  But they tend to live on their growing edge, taking life for what it is, and actually having fun and plenty of experiences with it.<br>  Those that live fearful or regretful waste their lives.|`|14f68b3ce9b74fe1effcb259219a38a9aa	The only true security is death. In life, there are no guarantees, just opportunities to be part of a community, to love and be loved and make every day count. Just because I know I could be killed by a drunk driver does not prevent me from driving and just because I know nothing is for sure doesn't stop me from living life to it's fullest.|`|5bkmSQ3Raa	We can know that if we are willing to love unconditionally that we actually do have security in our willingness to love.  A lot of people talk about unconditional love, but, in practice, not that many people really do it.  If we are willing to meet any situation or circumstance with love, then we can feel secure in knowing that we are living in a world that's filled with love.  Best wishes!|`|TLjbMQPRaa	Become depressed enough to be indifferent to your own life.|`|81f4bd177f89ba16026dc0eb51fd1cbaaa	By remembering yourself. Then you have much self-security.|`|AA11564934	by simply accepting it.  Life can not be made 100% secure.  To wish for that is to wish for Santa Claus.|`|yOK32PM9aa	There is no real security in attaching to objects, ideas, and situations, all of which are subject to change.  But this has little to do with confidence, which can be cultivated as a belief in one's ability to do good and to thereby be happy.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	By truly realizing that there is no security. Saying you realizing it is the opposite of realizing it. Saying "I realize this and it applies to me" is an avoidance of it altogether when life constantly tells us we can't avoid anything. Differentiating things as secure and insecure (even if it's life itself) is not accurate and is there in compensation for something you fear. There is no security, but that doesn't really mean anything. If something is in nothing or in everything, then paying attention to it is useless because that looking is it too (or not it if it's in nothing). <br>  <br>  Indifference is how we treat 99% of the things we receive from sensory input, and it's not good or bad, and it really has no effect (or full effect).<br>  <br>  Nothing and everything are the same in terms of practical use.|`|KK5nbzGuaa	There is no security in bondage of Time Space Causation. Beyond that is freedom. Set higher spiritual goals.|`|tBXn97NNaa	Simple: we are all in this together.|`|YmtNel5haa	fake it.
ZwECcnh1aa	I believe that the place we come from and return to is our true home, which is, like you say, cool and peaceful. Its the death of the ego, which is the root cause of all suffering, and release of our souls from the prisons of our earthly shackles into eternal bliss. People fear it because they dont know this, and I cant blame them, I used to be afraid of that void aswell. But all their fears are misgiven.|`|81f4bd177f89ba16026dc0eb51fd1cbaaa	You don't know what exist at death, unless you have experienced. People of this world, do not know what occurs -- they have neither seen nor perceived. Their thinking is culturally bound, they know nothing beyond their subjective world. So they are afraid, because in death their subjective world ends. <br>  <br>  If the majority of their life is lived in keeping with the mindset, lifestyle, and thinking of this world, to the degree that they are on autopilot and the world dictates how they are, what they've been, and where they are going -- then how can they exist outside of such? How can they exist a part from a world that possesses them -- where everything they are identified with in the wrong way and do not know thy self? It's frightful, especially when you consider the degree at which one is unconscious in their life, how can our life be ours when we are unconscious on autopilot being dictated by what is outside of us? It's a frightful prospect. For one to enter into LIFE they must die in regards the world, they must die to that part of themselves that is in complete dominance and from which all their manifestations come from, that clings to the world. <br>  <br>  Before conception a person does not exist -- this does not mean a peaceful state. Peace is something that is gained through harmonious development between two opposing forces to bring about a ONE-NESS within oneself. This does not exist for a person who does not exist.|`|Nuu5zUWuaa	Because nobody knows what is in store for them when they die, it is the fear of the unknown and the fear of losing loved ones behind|`|Lq4E8mKSaa	Fear of the unknown I should think!<br>  <br>  Even though some people may shun life while the are on this planet, it's an existance they know.|`|AA11564934	death is the end, it's not sleep, or rest,  it's the END.  Poof... dead|`|yOK32PM9aa	Lots of people don't see it as nonexistence - there might be some unpleasantness in the afterlife.<br>  <br>  Those who deny the afterlife would probably not look forward to the actual process of dying - it is usually nasty!<br>  <br>  We are probably pre-programmed with the fear, in order to ensure that we stay alive long enough to reproduce.  This makes the fear irrational, but intractable.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	What exactly is peaceful about nothingness? What possible quality does everythingness-nothingness (same thing) have? Where does this presumption of peace come from? I personally think that awareness has it's use, and being aware of awareness has it's use too, but too much of anything is bad (in my opinion). We as a society put a lot of importance on focusing and attention, but why? Why do we assume that it's necessary to be involved in self improvement? Why do we assume that we wont get better unless we engage ourselves? How do we know one way or the other?<br>  <br>  Peacefulness is dullness. It's totally numbing and unreal.<br>  <br>  "Most of our time in nonexistence" presumes that nonexistence has  any kind of quality to it, being space OR time. The reason quantum science (which is severely flawed in some ways) says that there is a quantum field of infinite possibility is because it has no form or location. Form is a result of resistance upon "something else", if something is whole (completely) it will have no form or age.<br>  <br>  There is the potential for a perception of infinite time, because it has no form (space and time being one and the same).|`|AA12071271	that is the one thing that everybody fears no matter what they believe in. people like me who believe in an afterlife fear death because they're afraid they havnt done their part right. that they havnt been a good muslim, christian, jew etc. people who dont have any religion or belief are scared of being alone. all our lives we have been surrounded by people whether we know them, love them, or hate them. to suddenly have absolutely nothing, being six feet under, is  horrifying. that is why near death experiences break even the toughest of us and changes us.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Once you exist you are..<br>  when you are you want to continue to be..<br>  of course a baby in the womb thinks that is all there is comfort until its pushed unceremoniously out of the mother...<br>  it doesn't know about the unknown, so fear isn't part of its makeup. We fear unknown unless we have complete faith in the hereafter and assured through hope.|`|gspTDufpaa	I just see death as the final act. Nothing more.
AA10729675	Yes.  Torture has always existed and unfortunately will always exist.<br>  It is not a pleasant question and not a pleasant answer. Nothing here can be justified.  Nothing.  It is only a proof that technology does not mean that we are more intelligent, more refined nor more powerful.|`|qDYzdz5daa	More "civilized" countries will use torture, when they think it will benefit them, than are willing to admit.  We are quickest to condemn in others what we see in ourselves.<br>  <br>  Does it work?<br>  <br>  Sometimes.  It's not entirely useless, when it's something that is quickly verifiable.  Say you need someone's password, and they won;t tell you.  You have a computer nearby, you torture them, they talk, and if the password they give you is correct, you can verify it immediately.  That would work.<br>  <br>  The torturer looks for the thin zone where the informant is between not speaking the truth, and telling the torturer anything they can, even lies, to get the pain to stop.  It's a pretty thin line, which makes torturing an unreliable method.<br>  <br>  Of course, that's torturing for information.<br>  Torturing as punishment or as plain sadism, that's a different subject entirely.|`|qdlmy4l8aa	Search: "Sidney Gottlieb." <br>  <br>  Who's deciding where the line is drawn; the TORTURERS?<br>  <br>  If the fate of the country were to rest in my bloody hands, it wouldn't be worth saving. It'd have failed beyond repair, and a catastrophe is always a good catalyst for a swift bringing-about of a new government. Though, it'd most likely be a dictatorship. Those do work the best! <br>  <br>  I suggest "Secrets and Lies: A History of CIA Mind Control and Germ Warfare" by Gordon Thomas if you're interested in this sort of thing.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Every country potentially. We have NO idea about what anybody that is above the law is doing 99% of the time. Government is above the law which to me is EXACTLY the same as organized crime.<br>  <br>  The CIA has bigger fish to fry, the usually delegate that responsibility to some lower agency.|`|w2qV8WEmaa	Every countries have some form of torture.<br>  <br>  In some countries, they make the prisoners strip naked in a cold air condition room for hours. The prisoners will not wounds on their body so they cannot prove that they have been tortured.|`|ZYCRkgawaa	There are 2 opposing thoughts on torture. One says that a person will admit to anything under enough torture, so the information gained is questionable. The other says that the fear of torture may get someone to confess information that otherwise would not come out. <br>  <br>  We have in the last years since 9/11, and in past times as well, used rendition--giving a prisoner to another country--where that country will do whatever it wants to a person to get info. <br>  <br>  If there are drugs like sodium pentathol--truth serum--and similar drugs that gain us information without torture, then I am all for it. <br>  <br>  As far as I've read, the CIA and other covert groups have always used torture, or torturers, to gain info. <br>  <br>  Along with all the tortures that have been invented over thousands of years, you can now add electric, acid, and other modern inventions to the list. In Iraq they told blindfolded naked prisoners that the wires they were holding were electric to get them to confess, and of course waterboarding where you think you are drowning (look up Abu Gareb--may be misspelled--prison). Also they used vicious dogs and other culturally abhorant treatment like naked twister. <br>  <br>  So man will always think up humiliating and cruel ways to treat those he considers less than him to make that person cooperate. <br>  <br>  I am more for drugs and less for torture, mainly because I think the information gained is more credible. <br>  <br>  The problem with fighting a war with people who have no fear of death and are likely to torture you if given the chance, is that you cannot fight them with a different set of scruples and expect to win. They will know that they will win. People may not be afraid to die, but no one wants to experience pain. So as the saying goes, no pain, no gain.|`|AA11564934	OMG, where have u been?  The USA has been torturing extensively throughout the Bush administriation.<br>  <br>  I'm sure we did b4 too, but this is the 1st time the pres tried to act like it was legal.<br>  <br>  All experts say torture is very unreliable and gets u crap information as much as good.|`|yOK32PM9aa	Yes, methods became more sophisticated - there is "white noise" and various drugs that cause psychological unease.  The latter is compounded by increasing sophisticated psychological methods of disorientating and demoralising suspects.  Often, though, the old classic methods are the best.<br>  <br>  I imagine the CIA have evolved their methods, but also that evidence is patchy and hard to come by.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would not torture another human being for the sake of my country.  The country is largely other human beings too!
UqsLUzSiaa	You're correct in being concerned about a studio photographer's ability in an "Event" situation.  Studio Lighting is a very predictable scenario and many dramatic effects can be relied on.  Wedding photography generally occurs in oddly lit rooms, spaces with different color temperature lighting and outdoor situations.  Add to that, unplanned people moving around, adverse weather effects, etc. and you have a situation that's about as far away from studio work as you can get.  Do yourself a favor and put your mind at rest; get a person who knows how to shoot a wedding.  You won't regret it in the end.|`|CyUxMcWSaa	I'm really not sure how to answer this.  I have done both event and studio, but it's no secret that I'm horrible at event photography.  If you leave me to my own devices I would be shooting up close a personal portraits at an event rather than the event itself.  I'm sure if I worked at it I probably would do better, but the best event photographer could also double as a photojournalist.<br>  <br>  Almost all the event/wedding photographers I've met work with zoom lenses and speed lights exclusively.  The big time pros have second shooters and assistants.  The also have a strong grasp on using battery powered mono-lights in a church for the large portrait.<br>  <br>  Studio photographers, such as my stronger point, have much more equipment to set up but are not roving around a church or hall.  All the work is done with either hot-lighting or strobes (my preference).  Cameras are set the lowest iso rating or the slowest film iso, always in manual mode.  Almost always we use fast prime lenses, although the newest zooms are starting to compete with that school of thought.<br>  <br>  Some photographers can do both extremely well, some don't.  Best way to tell is to ask to see thier portfolio of examples.  If they claim to do both, ask to see examples of both.|`|jAwnqfBGaa	I would have to agree with Jerry, it depends on the photographer and it's something you'll have to talk to that photographer about. <br>  <br>  Also, you're using Deviantart to find an event photographer? Really? That seems so crazy to me. I personally wouldn't want to hire a photographer that didn't have a more professional site. I don't know, maybe I'm behind in Deviantart updates or something. I deleted my account a long time ago. <br>  <br>  Again, I would talk to the photographer and ask them about their style, their preference (studio vs. event) and if they've even done event work. <br>  <br>  I'm a photographer and I have no problem telling someone that I'm more comfortable with event photography than studio. I have experience in both, but I prefer event photography and the images you can get from it. Above everything else, the photographer is there to provide quality work for the client, and if you can't provide it, you shouldn't promise it.

OkE3oBZZaa	Overall, if you can separate the actor from the character. They are not in the scene. Can you see when people are thinking on stage about being on stage? When they are considering themselves as actors as opposed to the character they are playing? They are thinking about their blocking or whatever business happens in the scene... that is not good acting. <br>  <br>  Stanislavsky would suggest that you need something in your life to reference to make your performance authentic. I find that that tends to lead actors out of the scene at the height of the Moment... ie something big happens and they are supposed to get emotional, so they decide to think about their dead grandma... instead of being fully in the circumstances of the scene. <br>  Grotowski would try to beat that out of his students by doing things like making them perform extreme physical feats, thus wearing them out, so their brain would stop getting in the way... and then make them act.<br>  I would say that both have their points, but in the end the truth comes out of the actor. Cheating either way is just trying to bypass the part that makes it a difficult craft to master. Opening yourself emotionally and being in the circumstances is what, in the end, makes good acting.|`|hwvQy100aa	'Bad' acting usually is the result of 'indicating', or 'showing' as opposed to 'being'.  When you are aware that the actor is telegraphing his character, his emotions, his intentions, when he is showing you instead of living it, the result is acting that is less than desirable.  This often happens when the actor is trying to achieve a result instead of being in the moment.|`|Mig6O93Naa	Bodder is the best answer so far.  Most people think they can  judge acting in a film, but it really is nearly impossible to do. Films are illusions and much of the effectiveness or lack of it is due to editing, lighting, music, etc.|`|JJARLh3zaa	well, it's all a matter of opinion, really. but i think that if you try and see someone act in more than one movie, then compare the acting. if it's very similar, the acting is bad (unless he/she is acting the same sort of character)|`|nCLcdJO0aa	When you can tell they are acting, when you don't understand the character or story, if they are too over the top or if they are underacting.<br>  <br>  Easy enough, so I'm pretty sure that you could guess it on your own.|`|JfT65q88aa	When you can tell they're acting, it's bad acting. That was easy.|`|P7Ae8j2Xaa	It depends on how believable they are. If it's too overthetop, bad acting. If there is no passion in it, bad acting. If they don't portray the character as described in the script, bad acting.
ecffc7a6f0f52a209ef347ba28b2c1e5aa	San Marino joined Italy in declaring war on Britain in 1940, declared its neutrality after the Italian surrender and declared war on Germany when it was invaded by Germany in 1944.

rtsfPQqMaa	It is called negetive integration- Germany at the turn of the century was plauged by 19th century divisions: Regional, Religious, Class. Rapid pace of economic change outstripped individual’s ability to cope with change- Germany achieved in 40 yrs what it took Britain 100yrs. Traditional structures were strong, but economic progress generated new rivalries, and tensions between the classes and led to a strong sense of dislocation, these divisions were made deeper by this rapid industrialization in the mid 1800s.  <br>  <br>  Negative integration-- has been used by historians to describe Bismarck’s domestic policy. It is a manipulative strategy on the part of the chancellor, designed to safeguard the authoritarian system in an age of rapid social and economic change by focusing the attention of ordinary Germans on a common enemy, large enough to be credible but not serious enough to threaten the Reich’s political survival. In other words, keep the people preoccupied with enemies, both internal and external and then they will not think to question the state in a serious manner.<br>  <br>  essentially he created an in and an out group- its kind of like ralley around the flag (i.e US vs.Terrorism)

35GfsJ3Paa	Check out the Percussive Arts Society website: www.pas.org<br>  <br>  If the humidity in the air at your home and the air at your school is very different, the change in atmosphere could cause warping. I am a clarinetist, and I have to keep both my reed bag and my wooden clarinet humidified to prevent warping and cracking. I use orange peels and Dampit humidifiers (they are actually made for violins). The orange peel thing is kind of specific to clarinets, but the humidifier could help you if your school or home is very dry and the other place is very humid. These are pretty inexpensive and sold at most music stores. They are thin green rubber tubes that you soak in water and put in your instrument case.<br>  <br>  Make sure that your stick bag doesn't go inside a backpack or anywhere where anything heavy (like textbooks) could be against it.

You could take a teaching training course after studying history at university and become a history teacher in a school, although you have already ruled this out. You could do a Masters and then a PhD in history and become a professor at a University. You could try and get a research position in a university, or apply for a research grant for a specific topic and get yourself a position at a university for the length of the grant.<br>  <br>  I'd avoid Time Team. They haven't had a historian on there for years. I've seen behind the scenes behind a recent episode and it was nothing like what they put on TV. I won't say anymore but it's more for people who want to do archaeology and be on the TV....<br>  <br>  I found some great websites with ideas of what you can do, including at least one made by a university showing what sort of things it's students did. They are worth taking a look at. All these pages are in the UK.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/history.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/history.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.qca.org.uk/history/innovating/history_matters/careers/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.qca.org.uk/history/innovating...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/student/career-planning/az-careers/history-671658.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.independent.co.uk/student/car...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ihgs.ac.uk/courses/careers_in_family_history.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ihgs.ac.uk/courses/careers_in...</a>|`|7i6qj4OXaa	You could obviously be a history teacher.  Other possibilities are archivist, museum curator or librarian.|`|xKuWE9gfaa	When I went to uni and did History (1994)I had no choice of period to study, it all depends on the curriculum. I was a little disappointed as some of the periods we studied I had actually lived through (6 day war etc) but it didn't make it any easier. (Mature student) so make sure you check up before you enrol.|`|c12ff2f01aee1d7228df9c10d0d77908aa	Time Team.<br>  <br>  The above answers are viable as well, depends if you want to teach or work in a museum.  Researcher could be fun, especially in relation to historical accuracy on television programs.<br>  <br>  Failing that, join the astro physicists in warehouse work.<br>  <br>  Luck|`|8WdFnf0Eaa	Many companies have historians.  Here in the states, there are historians employed by Starbucks, Kellogs, Mattel (the people who make Barbie), and countless others.  I'm sure the same holds true in England.|`|cwJrCcguaa	Why don`t you broaden your horizons and take in `Scotland,Ireland and Wales you ENGLISH ...........|`|09YWnp8paa	There are an awful lot of careers that value history because it is so academic. The law is the obvious one, and journalism because of the high-level writing skills you have to develop. But these will require you to take further study in your chosen field. So, it might be a better option if you take your A levels and then consider another degree option. True history careers are few and far between; research is probably the most common, or local government or, if you also study a foreign language, the diplomatic service values history enormously.
4dgrwFU4aa	Roman numerals for the Super Bowls|`|2GNFQPdmaa	Let's start with something very basic. Their language - Latin - evolved into French, Spanish, and Italian. Through old French, it's a major source of the English language also. Language is a very basic part of any civilization, and most Western European languages evolved out of Latin.<br>  <br>  Then there's religion. Religion is a powerful force that motivates people to do many things. The dominant religion of Western civilization is Christianity. Would Christianity have spread the way it did if Constantine hadn't made it the official faith of Rome?<br>  <br>  Government: America is a Republic, in some ways modeled on the Roman Republic. There are many similar governments all over the world. Even before Western civilization embraced this idea, the Romans influence them: the German word for king is Kaiser, which originally comes from "Caesar."<br>  <br>  That's just a few ways.
mlI1YvCnaa	It was a rediscovery of old learning and also a time of figuring out new ways of looking at the world.During the crusades europe was exposed to different cultures and ways of looking at the world they had rejected the works of the Romans and ancient Greeks because they where pagans but some of thous writing survived in arab culture and where looked at again by europeans.A liberalization of the society in general also contributed to less ridged thinking. It was a time of recovery from the dark ages, less war, no more Viking raids and a generally better economy gave people more time the think and discover or rediscover knowledge.

If I have trouble with any writing I will usually go for fiction wars in the future or a conlict between two protagonists who never get to meet each other because of so and so. Or last resort write about two best friends fighting over a girl they loved, who likes someone else anyway. Try to broaden what your looking for.   Good Luck!|`|va9TP82Haa	It's something you have to decide.  If it's ideas you want, read alot of books, watch alot of movies, etc.  You can't ask other people to do it for you.<br>  <br>  ...but I do like books with alot of death and mentally deteriorating characters.

AA12029969	A professional critical review is one where a literary editor (or allocated journalist) of a newspaper, magazine or other media outlet expresses their honest opinion of a given book.  Their critique would consist of a summary of the storyline, giving the opinion of the critic as to the good and/or the bad content, whether that criticism is of style, plot or depth of characters, etc.<br>  <br>  I have given a link to an educational guide on what constitutes a good book review.  (See paragraph itemised 1 to 9, which states which points should be addressed in the review).<br>  <br>  One should not underestimate the customer reviews given on web site pages such as Amazon.com or Noble.com, since these reviews (albeit amateur) are sometimes more in tune with the average reader.<br>  .|`|hxBeeBv4aa	I think it would be like a review that sums up the book and also contains your opinions on the book.<br>  <br>  Maybe like one you would read by a critic in a newspaper or online.

Just started using Maya and I'm really liking it...it's got some great tools.  Blender is fast at modeling and doing quick fluid simulation and cloth simulations...but has a tough learning curve.  I don't really think there is a "best" its just what you know and can use efficiently.
