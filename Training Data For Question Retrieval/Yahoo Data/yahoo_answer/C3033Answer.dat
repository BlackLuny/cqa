jeF8bzg8aa	I can only comment about Western Australia, but I think the other states are similar.<br>  <br>  In order to serve alcohol in WA you have to complete a responsible service of alcohol certificate within one month of gaining employment. Most businesses ask if you have completed the course before employing staff these days. The course can be completed online at <a href="http://www.clubswa.com.au/training" rel="nofollow">http://www.clubswa.com.au/training</a> for $80.<br>  <br>  All liquor outlets require an Approved Manager to be on the premises at ALL times so if you complete this course you would be of greater value to prospective employers. This course is also available online at <a href="http://www.clubswa.com.au/training" rel="nofollow">http://www.clubswa.com.au/training</a> at a cost of $300 (this course also includes modules covering the responsible service certificate)
V0gyMerYaa	I used them about 5 months ago for a loan mod and I was very pleased with what they did. Went from like $2400 a month (9.5% arm, yeah I know stupid mistake), to $1600 a month... made all the difference in the wrold for me. Had a hard time convincing the wife at first, but what finally got her was when I said we wouldnt try to represent ourselves in an auto accident or other legal case, why should we in this case when our house and everything we worked for is at stake. We obviously didnt do a good job getting the first loan, so how would the modification be different? I wanted some lawyers on the ball with this thing....thats my two cents...|`|3mAgM405aa	Anyone who conducts a google.com search for "parsa law group scam," will bring some 2,980 search results which simply state:  "It's a scam."<br>  <br>  Sorry about that!|`|cK28Kl0Uaa	I don't know anything about this specific company.<br>  did you read the article in Sunday's (2/15) LA Times about the mortgage modification/foreclosure process? <br>  I would probably read that before sending the money.  The article had info about what you should do when/how.<br>  <br>  If the money is for them to help you get a mortgage modification then it doesn't make any sense.  If the money is for closing costs for the new mortgage as long as the terms of the new mortgage are ok, then it shouldn't be a problem.  On CBS news last week they said 50+% of people who had done mortgage modifications were still losing their houses, so you need to make sure the new mortgage is something that is feasible for you.|`|d2YPsVkDaa	One of my co-workers saw a commercial of theirs and called because when her mortgage readjusted, so couldn't pay it. She told us that they were incredibly professional and like the commercial they were able to get her mortgage re-negotiated with her lender. <br>  <br>  I consider this co-worker very honest and hardworking, so if she recommended them (and even used them in the first place) it was because she really did find them to be trust worthy and legit.|`|Q85YV6bUaa	Just out of curiosity of the last answer, I did a Google.com search of "Parsa Law Group Scam" and there was actually 3080 listings. I also decided to look thru EVERY page (took me a while) and there was only ONE listing that was not positive. The rest of the "scam" listings were interviews with this Parsa guy talking about scams....<br>  <br>  search for "parsa law group SCAMS" - <br>  3079 informative listings.....1 negative listing....<br>  <br>  Sounds pretty reliable to me if even when you search for scams you cant find more than one bad remark out of 3000+<br>  <br>  2 mins of research online will show you how solid this company looks. I think you should do it if you can afford it.|`|cQxHiCYtaa	Never had personal experience with them so I can't say whether you can trust this entity.  I am a firm believer in being an informed consumer.  So before you send your money, read this: <a href="http://badbizfinder.wordpress.com/2009/01/15/another-parsa-law-group-scam-crisis-on-main-street-tv-ad/" rel="nofollow">http://badbizfinder.wordpress.com/2009/0...</a>|`|eow59EaEaa	From what I can see there are tons of positive things written about them and they are obviously doing well if they have commercials and adds. People wouldn't be giving them there money if they were corrupt.<br>  <br>  It also says they are a law group so maybe that's why they have a slightly higher fee?|`|4Ukvjiqvaa	Hey there. one of my buddies works for them so I can def. tell you they are legit. And he is doing very well which means there are other people who have put their trust in them too.<br>  <br>  You have to realize they are actual lawyers who are representing you so you are paying them like you would a lawyer who is representing you in court...it's not just one of those non-profit companies. <br>  <br>  With the way the economy is going you don't wanna mess around with your lenders.|`|9BiGpRrOaa	Just hired them today. Was searching around and reading whatever i could find. I dont qualify for Obamas plan because I missed a couple of payments already so I'm an "irresponsible homeowner" LOL. Looks like a loan mod inside a bankruptcy might be the answer for me. I went to their office and theres like freakin 200 people there, everyone very nice, thats all i needed to see.|`|arYogy8yaa	I have been reading about these guys and they seem pretty solid. They have a A rating with the BBB which is very outstanding. They seem to know what they are doing because their history shows that they have been successful in like 98% of their cases. I am going to call to get my case looked at and see just how much they can lower my payment by.

qO8wiWFuaa	16 years old for a part time job<br>  18 years old for a full time job|`|iRQMldYxaa	13 for some, 16 for others, 18 for others still, and even 21 on some. It depends on the job. Good luck, you're gonna need it to find a job the way things are now...|`|9EVcTnUWaa	In NY city to get an official job you need to be 14 years old to get your working papers.  I know I have a daughter who's 16 and getting her first job this summer.  There are two series of working papers that you get. One set at 14 which determines what type of job you can do and what hours you can work. Than at 16 you get another set which gives you more job options and longer hours and allows you to work after school hours. It depends on what type of job you want to get and how many hours you want to work.  Talk to your school they might be able to help you get your working papers and a job.  You should think about applying for the Summer youth employment program.  You're not guaranteed to get a job but you have a chance and they will hire you if you're only 14. Otherwise its hard to get a real job until you're at least 16.|`|9284ee3983e65d73358926c4a32bf327aa	Like my friend said in the huge paragraph above me said<br>  you are going to need work papers (permit) to work if ur under the age of 16<br>  but i know a site that will make you money and all you have to be is over the age of 13 and need a valid address<br>  its safe free and fast<br>  you can find the link at the bottom of my blog<br>  good luck<br>  james|`|ov2WwZXDaa	-21
Tw0rpc88aa	I have several storage units for my company that don't allow any power usage (no outlets to be found anywhere,) so that might be an issue. Your best bet is to find a locally owned place, not a big chain and read the rental agreement.<br>  <br>  I also know several bands who practice at one of the various Activespace's.<br>  <a href="http://activspace.com/" rel="nofollow">http://activspace.com/</a>|`|4aAhEK9daa	You'd have to ask the particular one you're interested in.  I know some do, most don't.  A lot of depends on their proximity to homes and other businesses (because of noise) and whether or not they allow things to be plugged in (since they could be a fire hazard).|`|GkX0D1IRaa	I sure hope so, since I know several bands that do it.

That way, you won't have to look for work ever again and you help lots of people with their work situations. When you give your new business the time and effort,  you will make the money you need... I do.     This is what I found when I was looking for at home work.   I tried over 19 opportunities in the course of 4 years so I have some great information for you.    A lot of people are looking for work from home companies. All the scams definitely create a big problem but also, there is a problem of people misunderstanding the difference between work from home "jobs" and work from home opportunities. There really are not work from home jobs. To get that you have to start working for a company in their offices first, then they MAY allow you to take the job home.    Most of the work from home opportunities that are legitimate offers are not an hourly pay type job. They are business opportunities that help you in starting your own business from your home. What you should do first is to decide if you are simply looking for an hourly rate type job or if you are looking for more of an opportunity for additional income such as what you would make in your own business being your own boss from home. Small home businesses have some small costs involved, less than $500 to start is reasonable and I would stay away from those wanting $1000-$5000. It does not cost that much to start and run a home business so you shouldnt pay it.    If you are coming across places that say free then I would RUN dont walk the other way! They never are. I tried them many a times and 3 weeks later I had to buy this and 6 weeks later that. After 6 months these free businesses had cost me over $800 on average.    After trying tons of things, I now work about 10-25 hours per week (depending on how life is going) for a National Medical Health care Company. This is a nationally known and reputable home business which is what you need to make sure you are looking for. I have been with the company since Feb. I make a good living with them! In your first month, depending on how many hours you can work, I have seen people make anywhere from $500 to over $1000. And your income will increase each month because you get paid residual income as well. This is where you do the work once, but every month when your customer pays their monthly bill, you get your commission again. Again and again, month after month, year after year. Thats called residual income.    The best part is they have 401(k), direct deposit, life insurance and a benefits package most of which you get from day one. In addition, there are no products, no hard selling or pushing, no cold calling, no home parties and no telemarketing! That was VERY important to me. I absolutely love working with them and I can't believe I am making what I am making and in so few hours per week. The great thing is the people on your team work with you  so you are never alone. You will have team support and make friends.   This company is the number one National Medical Benefits Company in the US. They are a member of the US Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Dental Plans and the owner of the company actually sits on the board of The Consumer Health Alliance to which we are also members. Also they were featured in The New York Times, Wall Street Journal Time Magazine American Medical Review and even in the May 2008 issue of Parents Magazine. Even 60 Minutes did a big special on this home based business.    Even more then all this is they are accepted at over 100,000 retailers nationwide. These are fortune 500 companies like Sears, Target, K-mart, Rite Aid, CVS, Wal-mart, Publix and more. These companies would never work with a company that was anything less than reputable.    You can research the company at www.Freedomathometeam.com/healthndental     There are some legit home businesses out there so be careful. Look for companies in business over 10 years. Look for companies with a needed product or service, something you would be proud to represent. Look for companies that have a national reputation and are members of the US Chamber of Commerce.    As for those who tell you or say ..I want to work from home but I dont want to have to pay for anything. Well, thats great! But it will never happen. Lets be honest, there is no such thing as a free lunch.  Good luck on your hunt and I hope my life experience has helped you out.

BBNsl4W2aa	You have asked too many questions at once. If this is for a job interview or a homework you should put more efforts into answering these questions yourself.
6acf261c60133ec9fab1a6edcff48d15aa	Well the most important question is "Is it opened?"  If the answer is yes, then you are out of luck.  Copyright laws will not allow Target or any other retailer to return an opened game.  You can only exchange it for the exact same item.  If the answer is no, then you will be able to return it for the price the guy paid for it.  So lets say the game is $50 originally, but the guy was a team member (10% discount) and happened to use his Target Rewards for his credit card (10% discount) which would bring the price down to approximately $40.  In this case, you would get only $40.  The sales tax that you get back for it will be determined by how much tax he paid, not how much tax is in your area.  And it will go on a gift card.  When using a gift receipt there is no other option but to get it on a gift card, even if you were the one who originally paid for it.  You could always take it in and have them scan it and they will tell you exactly how much you would get back for it.  But again, if its opened, you will only be able to exchange it for the exact same item.

Just drive along it and you'll see ton.|`|R46rxxGyaa	What Shift said is correct but there are other places too.  The I-85 Jimmy Carter area is another place.   Jonesboro Riverdale Morrow area is another.  There are few parts of metro Atlanta where there are not some Asian shops near by so the easiest thing is to go to the phone book yellow pages or <a href="http://www.switchboard.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.switchboard.com</a> or <a href="http://www.yelowpages.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.yelowpages.com</a> and look up the kind of store you want (grocery, gift, etc) and the part of town (Doravlle, Jonesboro, Norcross) and find those with Asian names.   You may want to call them to be sure they are what you are looking for.
