53216puqaa	You're confusing paying with taking.   Think of our situation in this manner: Obama is Prince John; the Congress are the Court Favorites; the Leftist (Soros, Union Bosses, Al Gore... ) are the crooked Bishops; the Cabinet share the role of the Sheriff of Nottingham; the 'media' are the royal spies; and the lawyers and 'civic organizers' are the Bailiffs who lead the Henchmen at the direction of the afore mentioned leaders.  We need a Robin Hood!|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Paying taxes was patriotic for awhile..... I guess Obambi/Biden went back on their word on that one too.|`|xUQDTEbZaa	Gee, I remember both Palin and McCain having tax issues. Joe the Plumber, too|`|wppUvy4maa	The Dem's. enjoy spending taxes like yours and mine.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Oh please Mike! If those were Bush's picks you would be screaming bloody murder.    Democrats are hypocrites & Obama's appointees & Mike proves it.|`|yHwUbD6Saa	Let's see what Obama's done so far in TWO WEEKS....    1) Threw a $170 million party (pre-inaugural, inaugural, and post-inaugural) funded by the U.S. taxpayers (i.e. us), all in the celebration that his skin color is a shade or two darker than that of his opponents.    2) Supported and rushed through Congress a $700 billion bailout that did nothing to stimulate the economy and only increased our debt.    3) Is currently pushing through an almost $900 billion "stimulus bill" filled with things like $200 million for re-sodding the national mall (b/c it got destroyed during the racist, taxpayer-funded party mentioned in  1 above).    4) His nomination of Bill Richardson didn't go well due to scandal, and Richardson stepped down.    5) His appointee to head the IRS (Tim Geithner) didn't pay $34,000 in taxes that he owed, and Obama still supports him.    6) His nominee to reform health care (Tom Daschle) didn't pay $120,000 in taxes that he owed, and Obama still supports him.    7) He spent millions building three (two decoys) new limos despite the fact that Bush had new limos built only a few years ago. These new limos get fewer than 10 mpg for you "green" folks out there.    8) He spent millions putting a basketball court into the White House.    9) Millions of his bailout money to Bank of America funded a large pre-Super Bowl party.    10) He nominated one of the most scandalous, unethical people on the planet to be Attorney General (Eric Holder). Holder pardoned a terrorist arms dealer in order to impress the dirt ball's defense attorney who was a close confidant of Al Gore in hopes that Holder would be nominated Attorney General if Al Gore won the Presidency after Clinton (Holder was deputy AG under Janet Reno). He also blatantly lied about how the Elian Gonzales case was handled, stating that no night-time raid was conducted (it was) and that it was handled "sensitively" (despite the pic of a federal agent pointing an MP5 at a 6 year old with his finger on the trigger [violating the first rule of gun safety]). His ethical transgressions could fill a tome.    11) He nominated a bona fide member of the National Socialist Party of the U.S. to be in charge of the environment. Her name was quickly removed from the Socialist party web site shortly thereafter.    12) He's closing Gitmo while we're seeing former detainees back committing acts of terror against the U.S. and our allies. These 200+ current detainees will likely end up inside the borders of the U.S. as a result. Smart move.    13) We've seen the largest post-election stock market slump in recorded U.S. history.    14) Iran is mocking us as weak and negotiating with terrorists.    15) Russia, Venezuela, Cuba, and Iran are posturing since the election (passing Russian ships through the Panama canal, Russian meetings with Chavez, etc.).    16) Israel felt it necessary to abruptly invade Gaza and start a war to help themselves before Obama $&* s up our middle east policy by taking office.    17) Obama's chief of staff appointee (Rahm Emanuel) was caught on tape with corrupt IL gov Blagojevich (someone Obama formerly strongly supported).    18) A new senate seat was filled with the nominee chosen by the corrupt Blagojevich despite his impeachment and pending criminal investigation--all b/c of his skin color (supported by Obama).    In summation.....    In 2 weeks, we're viewed as weak internationally, the economy has plummeted faster than in any post-election period in recorded U.S. history, we're poised to double the deficit of Bush, and we've nominated and confirmed corrupt, tax-evading dirt balls to Obama's cabinet!

The leaders of the anti-American movements don't all live in caves.  Their teachings are still being taught, and the are growing their own hate, and spinning it on to us.  Sooner or later its going to happen, and if it happens when the libs are in charge, things are going to change.

SlhuFfuZaa	And the paper is too slick to use in the toilet. My roll of John Wayne toilet paper works better.    The dollar used to be worth a dollar in gold or silver, then they dropped the gold standard and now it isn't really worth the paper it's printed on.   A few years ago i read that the value of a dollar was about 35 cents, and we were in a recession then. The only thing that gives the dollar any value at all is your credit cards and the national debt. If the debt would get paid off and all credit cards were destroyed, the monetary system would collapse and this is why the Federal Reserve causes these little failures and recessions . This is to get the government to borrow more money from them.  At the start of the Civil War, Lincoln needed about $400,000 to finance the war. He went to the national bank to borrow the funds and they agreed and would charge 25 to 35 percent interest. Old Abe told them where to stick their interest and went to the Congress and told them to print silver certificates. We had enough silver to more than cover the $400,000. The Green back silver certificate held it's value but the national bank notes lost.   It is said that this was the main reason for the assassination of Lincoln. In 1963 Kennedy needed to fund the Vietnam War  and didn't like the deal that the Fed offered, so he did the same as Lincoln, with silver backing treasury bills. He was killed a few months later and the silver certificates disappeared as soon as the were spent.  The tax payer is being robbed by an illegal banking system.|`|35ZJauLkaa	Some say it's here others say it isn't    http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?p...

"(We) urge you to ensure that the economic stimulus package does not include trade-restrictive provisions -- including counterproductive expansions of Buy American-type mandates -- that would undermine the ability of American companies and workers to export goods and services made in the United States and thereby undercut the goals of this package," the groups said in a joint letter to leaders of Congress.    The Buy American provisions could encourage countries such as China, Germany, Britain, France, Australia and India to include similar measures in their infrastructure and stimulus packages, the business groups said.    It also could open the door to retaliatory trade sanctions on U.S. goods if challenged at the World Trade Organization and found to be a violation of international rules on government procurement.|`|AA11598520	Because, maybe, just maybe Americans can't be told what to buy and where to buy it from.

We'd be telling other countries we aren't gonna import their stuff. They will retaliate by denying our exports. That's called a trade war, which was exactly what put the "Great" in Great Depression. The trade war, caused by good intentions(!), was probably the root cause of World War 2, which killed 55 million people worldwide.    "Country first" means doing what's best for the country, instead of what's best for the party. Starting a trade war would be the absolute worst thing right now for America, and for the world.

I do not think Orlando is that dependent on the British for their survival.  I hear the Chinese are filling the void.  You should worry more about the Americans who may not travel this year because of worries over finances.  2. A country goes bankrupt just like people do, when they can no longer pay their bills.  With a country it is when no one will accept their money or their bonds.  3. You can also worry about the US.  We are financing all these stimulus by both selling bonds and by printing money.  When a country prints too much money the money loses value until finally no one will accept it.  Once money becomes valueless, we go back to a barter system.

In time, there will be such a desparity between those in the upper and lower class that they country will fall apart. In order to ensure the well being of this nation, we need to fix the way things are handled at the bottom of the food chain in our nation so that we will be able to help other nations in the future.

I think it mostly has to do with trying to deflect criticism.  If America decided to stop spending so much money on other nations issues we look like we are stingy and uncaring.

nr96BgWfaa	no, but those i've known have been complete weasels and only cared about themselves.|`|Uaci5YXWaa	Many years ago, I interned in Campaign Management in college and worked directly with the candidate in several congressional and senatorial campaigns.  I will tell you that politicians sit down with their staff, at least once a week, daily if events warrant it, and discuss events, what their position should be, what the polls indicate the voters in their district would like their position to be, and how they can outshine or undercut their opponents positions on these issues, so as to do good and look good to the constituents.     The candidate has the final say, but often he will change his position or at least agree to keep silent about it, in the interests of his constituents, or the Party, or President, or special interests which are important in his district.   So they sometimes promote bills that they actually disdain as a compromise position.  The degree to which they subsume their own beliefs for those of their party or constituents varies by candidate, time, place and issue.  The Public Relations guys often win out.    But what would you want them to do?  Should they ignore their constituents opinions and vote as they personally believe best, or should they vote the party line, or should they represent the views of their district?      That is the line politicians walk.  Is it any wonder that they fall off the path once in a while?|`|3yXhtBSxaa	I've never been in public office, have no desire to.

AA11963685	I agree with the mainstream Republican Party on immigration.  I'm a hard case when it comes to that.

I think they should tighten the belt when it comes to crime, but the ones that are here for many years, illegally, they should be given the chance to pay taxes after benefiting for so long from free government handouts, no? And I agree with reducing waste, and alternative energy sources, in moderation. I do not think oil should be completely ruled out.

777c8e30251ba73a1981f25573cd02fdaa	Well, the Italian flag and the Irish share the same colors and tones. But the Mexican flag is similar to the other twos but with strong colors. Very strong and bright green and red. In the center has the shield of the eagle. It is a Imperial Eagle and it is standing over a cactus and is eating a snake or serpent. We have a legend in Mexico that they say, the Mexicans were looking for the land to settle and the signal from Quetzalcoatl was that they were going to see in the middle of the lake a small portion of land and cactus and on top the eagle devouring a serpent. So they keep walking and finally they found what their God told them. And Tenochtitlan was founded in the same site, so that's why we have our Eagle in the middle of our flag in the white part. The green means our land, the white the eternal snow that covers the volcanoes and the red the blood of our heroes who died for our motherland. I hope that I help you.|`|gtvs0xb2aa	Yeah, I've noticed the similarity of colors just last year but sorry I still have no clue why. Even my Italian friends can't answer that.

bqJgdcfLaa	From the end of the fourth paragraph:  "If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions."    Auxiliary precautions are the subject of the article, viz. the internal checks and balances.  Elections are the primary check, but the structure of government, Madison believes should also be aimed towards protections from tyranny.|`|fL0wHyNNaa	I used to know that, and even wrote a paper about it.

Ronald Reagan was a creation of the right-wing think tanks that came into being in the middle seventies.If you look at the Heritage Foundation website you will see that they have a section called "What would Reagan do?" it looks to me to be a distortion of the Christian WWJD (What would Jesus do?).

Unfortunately for Obama and the Democrats Kennedy was actually conservative and was one of the first presidents to trickle down and supply side economics!    The difference is that Reagan actually accomplished something which earned him his following. If you don't believe me just check out both of the elections he won. He won them with the largest margins ever. Obama only wishes he could have won by as much! While Obama has done nothing and yet the Obamunists are willing to follow him over the cliff while chanting the hope and change montra.

He has railed against Wall Streets arrogance and greed. Drawing attention to shameful Wall Street bonuses of $18 billion, he described them as the height of irresponsibility.    I am not going to defend Wall Street excesses. It is unclear to me if these bonuses are excessive. But lets put all of this into perspective.    Americas economy is the engine of the global economy. We represent less than 5 percent of the worlds population and a disproportionate 25 percent of the worlds GDP. We remain the reserve currency of the world.    Wall Street has played a major role in American capitalism. Its executives should be well compensated.    I am not angry at Wall Street because the current economic crisis was not caused by Wall Street. And Wall Street is not prolonging the pain.    Our economic problems have emanated from Washington and from the Federal Reserve.    If any one needs to be shamed, how about starting with Congress? Congress has offered so little oversight of Wall Street  not to mention the executive branch and the Federal Reserve.    And yes, both Republicans and Democrats have played a role in the current mess.    What is abundantly clear in just the first two weeks of the Obama administration is that the Democrats have the wrong approach in fixing our problems.    We have seen that in the massive $800 billion-plus stimulus program, which largely goes to directly helping the unions that backed Obama and which benefits a massive laundry list of social welfare and pork barrel spending.    A careful examination shows the stimulus is nothing more than payback to many of the special interests that supported his campaign and the Democrats in 2008.    Almost half of the stimulus will directly benefit the private and public unions that backed Obama and the Democrats in the recent election.    Then, other hundreds of billions of dollars are spent on federal and state welfare programs. Even illegal aliens can collect checks of up to $1,000.    When I hear Obama wag his finger at bankers on Wall Street, I wonder if he really is serious about fixing our economy or simply replaying Franklin Roosevelt and the 1930s.    Unsuccessful at solving the countrys economic woes, some argue FDRs policies actually prolonged the Depression for almost a decade and shifted the publics focus on evil Wall Street.    During the 30s, FDR demonized corporate America in a skilful public relations effort that pitted Main Street against the wealthy elites.    Sound familiar?    Today, we need to place blame where it belongs. Where was Washington when the Fed and our regulatory agencies allowed zero percent loans to mortgage recipients who werent qualified?    Where were they as the financial institutions began collateralizing these loans and then leveraging them 10 to 1 or more?    Where were they when Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan slammed the monetary gas, dropping interest rates to a record low of 1 percent?    Where were they when, in 2004, the Fed reversed course and slammed the brakes on the U.S. economy, raising rates over 400 percent from 1 percent to over 5 percent in less than two years?|`|8SFoQvVLaa	In the past TWO WEEKS?

They are fed BS, sometimes drugged up and often times told they must amend for their sins by killing for God.     To understand Peace, you must understand the reasons for war, hate, crime and murder.    If you listen to terrorist propaganda like Hamas, the Jews drink the blood of Palestinian children.

See... in order to get a working visa (and a social security so you can get hired) you need to get a looot of education and experience in a field, normally more than it will be required for an american, and spend a lot of money in immigration and lawyers.

This video originates from numbersusa.com, an immigration website that is completely on top of immigration (legal and illegal) in Washington. The U.S. quota for legal immigration is 168,000 workers per month, and this number has not decreased despite record-high unemployment. The tech industry absolutely hires immigrants for less than their American counterparts, and they know all the loopholes that allow them to lay off American workers and hire the immigrants. Anyone who thinks this isn't going on is deluding themselves. For those of you who claim "they're just trying to better their lives", I ask if you've taken a few illegals under your own roof to feed, cloth, and pay for their medical? How many should we take in before the U.S. becomes a third-world nation? You cannot see further than the end of your nose to see what this has done to the quality of life in the U.S., and you must not have school aged kids crammed into ESL classrooms learning at levels below their capabilities, or you must have low paying jobs where you're not taxed to death to subsidize all the illegals that our government allows to remain while turning a blind eye to the laws they are breaking.

I think this is an issue that the government can not help. If we want to keep our jobs "We" the citizens must complain against the big corporations so they can not hire more of them. The government and big business want to bring more people for cheap labor. but that is something we are not willing to do. I think if we as Americans should roll our sleeves up and do the job and do it right.     I have a friend who owns is a self-employed carpenter. He have one worker who is from Afghanistan and he have lived here for many years. He is legal and is a citizen. He works hard. He makes sure that his boss is happy. The sad thing is that he hired and fired 25 employees under 3 months. Some of them came drunk to work some just have bad mouth who say the "F" "B" and "N" words a lot. during work.

e43b6e42489365436493bb48c6bb0ce2aa	Good luck trying to get so many huge and vast ideological differences throughout the world to agree on a common world constitution! Do you think you'd get any cooperation with Islamic nation-states to adhere to western republicanism? Or the Chinese and North Koreans? Fat chance, unless you conquered them and subjugated them to western civilization! And isn't that what the world is criticizing the US for doing in Iraq?    Even if we did reach an agreement, I still don't think it would work. With all the many different world views, more power would have to be vested in a central government to bring about global coherence. Which would take the "one size fits all approach" and that would mean less liberties for the sovereign states (especially the smaller, less populated ones) and certainly less to the individual. It's hard enough here in the US to come to agreement on issues, let alone on a global scale. Look how divided this nation of 300 million is. And you think 6.5 billion will be easier? Race, geopolitics, resources, population, and many other demographics and scenarios would create too much strife and fighting amongst each state for this idea to ever be plausible.    Bureaucracy would also be at an all time high. Just look how much bureaucracy there is in the UN, and it has no real authority over nation-states. If anything, a loose confederation of nation-states working together, somewhat like the UN would be more imaginable, but even that I disagree with. I prefer our Constitution and sovereignty.    Furthermore, what's to stop disgruntled states from ceding? And what right do we have to deny them their right to form their own sovereign state? Over the course of history, many unions, nation-states, and empires have fallen apart because of the vast differences of the regions and the peoples inhabiting them. What makes you think this day in age will be any different? Most regions would have their own selfish interests in mind, which is how the world has always been.    Edit: The needs of Tibetan Monks are going to be unequivocally different than a coffee bean farmer in Colombia. Which would make a global federalist system of governance the most elaborate and grandest balancing act humanity could ever conceive. What's wrong with nation-states just working together? The US gets along just fine with Europe and Canada just fine, yet we do not need to merge our governments.    Edit: I would point out that Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin said that the world was a class struggle, and that capitalism was the bane of humanity, and that Communism was the way to world harmony. Well, that didn't work out so well. My point is just because some philosophers or scholars say something will or won't happen, doesn't mean anything. Only time could tell if certain ideas would prevail or not, and just because Europe had nay-sayers about our fledgling nation which were proven wrong, doesn't mean the same will happen with a global federalist governance.    I disagree that common interests would prevail and bring harmony. That's way to idealistic for me. Even with the harmony between the US and EU, you don't think for one minute that they aren't trying to usurp us for the top spot in the world, or at least an equal footing? They obviously want the ball in their court, so again, nation-states have their own or regional interest in mind before the world's. Sure, when things are going well, nation-states are more likely to share some of the wealth, but as soon as the chips are down, or they feel backed into a corner, the realist, selfish nature of a nation-state will come to fruition.    Interesting question though! We need more thought provoking questions like this on Y/A instead of "When will Bush be tried for war crimes?" or "How many people has Bill Clinton had murdered?"    Edit: You'd also have a huge struggle on which system to implement. A struggle primarily between the US's presidential system and Europe/Canada's parliamentary system.|`|T1CuRwm3aa	I do|`|5zBEU99kaa	I am opposed to Federalism in the United States -- of course oppose global federalism!|`|XtQbPiD1aa	This country started out as a republic guided by a strong constitution with deeply entrenched civil/political liberties and look where we ended up.      With the best intentions, our founding fathers designed the framework of this country to decentralize the power of government to the states and to protect the liberties of its citizens.  During the past 100 years most of our elected officials, who took an oath to protect the constitution, have done everything in their power to undermine this framework and the constitution.      We now have a centralized government that believes its has the answer to every problem.  Coincidentally, the larger and more centralized the government gets the larger the problems get.  Here starts our circle of perpetual government.  Our government is so disillusioned in its ability to solve problems that they feel the need to do it for other sovereign nations irregardless of their willingness to participate.    In my opinion, the larger and more globalized a government becomes the less ability it has to represent the people it was entrusted to protect.  Liberties eventually erode until you find yourself a slave to a system that no longer has your best interests in mind.|`|mdHqr17kaa	FROM 1999:  http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/cronkit...    Walter Cronkite, the longtime liberal anchorman for the CBS Evening News, has given a speech before the World Federalist Association in which he has openly called for the establishment of world government. Cronkites association with the World Federalists has been known for years, but in this speech he discloses that he was asked 50 years ago to be a Washington lobbyist for the group. I chose instead to continue in the world of journalism, Cronkite said.      He told his audience that we must strengthen the United Nations as a first step toward world government,     with a police force able to enforce its international laws and keep the peace.     Cronkite called for the ratification of several U.N. treaties, including one that would create a criminal court to arrest and prosecute Americans.     He urged revision of the veto in the Security Council, which is the only safeguard the U.S. has to prevent the main U.N. body was imposing economic sanctions or using foreign troops against America.     First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton also delivered remarks to the group, hailing Cronkite for inspiring all of us to build a more peaceful and just world.     Hillary said that Cronkites receipt of the World Federalist Associations Global Governance Award was well-deserved.     Several years ago the award was given to Clinton Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who, as a columnist for Time magazine, had written about a world in which nation-states would disappear and people would become world citizens.     On that occasion, President Clinton sent a note to the gathering wishing them future success.     Cronkite said we would achieve world government by giving up some of our sovereignty.     He said, That would be a bitter pill. It would take a lot of courage, a lot of faith in the new order.  -----------------------------    and from 2005:  The pro-world government group known as Citizens for Global Solutions has given campaign contributions to four Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee now opposing John Boltons nomination as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.       Billionaire currency manipulator George Soros made financial contributions to six of eight Democratic members of the committee:  Obama, Boxer, and Bill Nelson, Joe Biden, Paul Sarbanes, and John Kerry.    A review of Federal Election Commission (FEC) data shows that a political action committee associated with Citizens for Global Solutions contributed financially to Foreign Relations Committee members     Senators Barbara Boxer, Christopher Dodd, Russell Feingold, and Barack Obama.     Citizens for Global Solutions used to be known as the World Federalist Association (WFA), a group that favors world government and global taxes on American citizens to pay for it.     The organization, which is leading the opposition to Bolton through television ads and a Stop Bolton web site, also contributed to the Republican committee chairman Senator Richard Lugar, who declined to issue a statement of support for Bolton when his nomination was announced.      Two groups explicitly associated with George Soros  the Open Society Policy Center and the American Progress Action Fund are working with Citizens for Global Solutions to defeat Bolton.  http://www.aim.org/press-release/aim-say...|`|uXVbvEX3aa	What the **** happened to national sovereignty?|`|8OaAmwq8aa	ok|`|ofP7bbX7aa	NO|`|i0vcEyJtaa	Global government only increases corruption, more power(tyranny), less rights, limited freedom of speech, and corporations calling all the shots for their own corporate profits, even if it's setting up a global army.

5zBEU99kaa	Why don't conservatives understand that under current US Laws is not murder..     If conservatives really were concerned all they would have to do is pass a law defining when life - for the purposes of protection under the law begins.

Yes, the government does, and should intervene in the case or murder. I agree.    Clump of cells: I consider myself to be alive because my brain functions and I have a self-consciousness. At the very least, without religious interjections, there is no basis for believing anything that doesn't have a beating heart is a living person.    Life at conception: See above, and I don't believe in souls, or divine prospect or anything like that.    Most of America agrees with me: nope, national polls suggest that most of America opposes the banning of first and 2nd trimester abortions, if you don't wanna look yourself, I can provide sources for it.      Since I have now effectively rebutted all of your points on why abortion should apparently be banned, I'll address your editorial commentary at the end: So you think a rape victim should be forced to go through pregnancy and have a child that resembles their rapist, give it up for adoption, and forever wonder how he/she is doing, feel like a bad person for not raising it, and forever have the physical and mental scars both from being raped and enduring the resulting pregnancy? I disagree with you completely, and think that the perspective you have only deepens my conviction to be pro-choice.|`|60YMS1xkaa	How many children have you adopted?

Murder is not equivalent to abortion by any stretch of the imagination.  Abortion can be bad and not be murder.  But, even if it were "bad" there is no sort of consensus on the fact it is bad like there is on murder.  The government has no business forcing mothers to carry babies to term, just like the government has no business forcing you to support individuals who are unwilling to work.

But I don't think it's a good idea to allow the government to control this aspect of our lives...at least not before the end of the 1st trimester.  I agree that, as Clinton said, ...Abortion should be safe, legal, and rare."  The rare part is the part I think we should be focusing on.  Out reach, education, and all kinds of contraception.  You folks who don't like abortion need to pick your battles.  In the bailout, for instance, was $200 Million dollars for contraception and family planning, which decreases the occurrence of abortions.  Yet this money has been fiercely protested and has not been removed from the bill.  You guys need to decide what's more important.  Either your stand against abortion, or your stand against public money being spent to keep young people from getting pregnant needs to be where you stand.  Pick one, not two and get what you want.
eIhD4y8Waa	Good one and drug test them to.|`|nhFsl1JTaa	first off there are only "535" members of Congress not 635.    Secondly while we are at it why not discuss why citizens are being illegally required to pay "income tax" in the first place?    The I.R.S is a private corporation not a Government agency, the Federal reserve is also a private corp.    Here just a few of the reasons why the income tax as we know it is completely illegal.  There is no law that requires anyone in the United States to pay a direct unapportioned tax on their labor.  The IRS is unlawfully imposing a tax on the American people that doesn't exist.      U.S. Constitution  Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3    Representatives and DIRECT taxes shall be APPORTIONED among the several states which may be included within this union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct. The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand, but each state shall have at least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the state of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three.    U.S. Constitution  Article 1, Section 9, Clause 4    No capitation, or other direct, tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.    Note:  The definition of a direct tax is a tax that cannot be avoided.  An indirect tax is a tax that can be avoided    Note: This means that the Federal government cannot directly tax the WAGES of the American people.  Any direct taxes must be apportioned or divided equally among the states which do have the authority to directly tax the people unless otherwise specified in that states constitution    5th Amendment    No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.    Note:  When you file a 1040 form you are giving the government information that could be used to put you in prison if you lie or make a mistake.  This violates youre right against self incrimination which is protected under the 5th amendment    Note:  There is no law that requires you to file a 1040 even though the IRS insists that its mandatory.  The 5th Amendment protects youre right against self incrimination which means you dont have to give any information to the government because it can be used to incriminate you.  Therefore any law that does require you to give any information to the government is unconstitutional  The only information that you are required to give the government is youre name and address which is used in the census to determine voting districts    16th Amendment    The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration.    Note: The Definition of Income was given in the Eisner vs Montgomery case to mean gains or profits from CORPORATE activity and not wages.  The 16th Amendment only allows the government to tax the income of corporations and not individual wages      Note: The government already had the power to directly tax the income of corporations therefore the 16th Amendment granted the government no new powers of taxation    Note:  The 16th Amendment was NEVER PROPERLY RATIFIED.  This is documented extensively in the book The law that never was by Bill Benson.|`|AA11995584	No need. They all come clean during their confirmation hearings.

VK0brk89aa	Obama is going to be HOOVER the 2nd if he doesn't smarten up and remember our history:        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Hoo...    Hoover deeply believed in the Efficiency Movement (a major component of the Progressive Era), arguing that a technical solution existed for every social and economic problem.     That position was challenged by the Stock market crash of 1929 that took place less than 8 months after Hoover's taking office, and the Great Depression that followed it which gained momentum in 1930.     Hoover tried to combat the Depression with volunteer efforts and government action, none of which produced economic recovery during his term.     The consensus among historians is that Hoover's defeat in the 1932 election was caused primarily by failure to end the downward spiral into deep Depression, compounded by popular opposition to prohibition.|`|AA11702773	Pretty much like Obama's.   FDR escallated the pace and extended the Depression by 7 years.    http://www.newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla...|`|3yXhtBSxaa	He was a complete and utter failure.  Just look up the "Bonus Army" and his response to them.  That should convince you he was a total f'ing jerk to the American people...American people who fought their asses off in one of the bloodiest wars in the history of the world.    Don, let's not change parts of history by omitting things to make it sound better.  Hoover was a Republican, so one would think that I, someone who boasts being a Republican, would stand up and defend him.  I will not.  Those vets were suffering, many of them could not find jobs in the rough economic climate.  I may be a Republican, but by G-d I am an American first and the way the Hoover administration treated those people was utterly disgraceful.  Some people died.    All they wanted was to get what they deserved.  I don't know what sort of revisionist history books you read to make you believe that Hoover was anything more than a piece of crap do-nothing President, but I beg you to watch some of the news reels from that time period.  It is on film how Hoover ordered those people to be removed--by any means necessary.    Their efforts, btw, is what got the G.I. Bill started.|`|AA10250939	Similar to Bush...he fiddled while Rome burned.|`|fPMVuB87aa	the H words|`|ofP7bbX7aa	Nothing that worked, and FDR's plan did not work either.  It took WW2 to get us out of the depression.|`|LUQX6Wglaa	People who have not studied history will say that Hoover did nothing.    Hoover tried many things to 'turn the tide' from 1929 to 1932.  These included:    Called for Volunteerism  Enacting Tariffs (taxes on imports)  Halted payments to some foreign nations  Removed Illegal Aliens  Public Works Projects  Tax Cuts  Tax Increases (including creating a corporate tax)    Saying he did nothing is remarkably inaccurate.      The Great Depression did not end until the US was pulled into WWII.  All of the Government spending and programs from 1933 to 1941 did nothing to help the situation, and many historians believe that FDR's New Deal prolonged the Depression.    EDIT - on and for "The Republican" - the Bonus Army was made up of WWI vets who wanted the bonus that they were promised to be paid in 1945 - TO BE PAID IN 1932 (an election year - dirty tricks were around in 1932, go figure) which would have been 13 years early.

Indentured servants had the future promise of fulfilling their servitude, becoming land owners them selves and joining the voters in helping direct the country rather than having the influence to vote on others investments...  (Making it difficult for politicians to buy votes with give away programs?)|`|cYuGYhGmaa	White, landowning males.|`|RPeqzomsaa	It was land owning males. White had little to do with it officially, but since blacks couldn't buy land, that was the end result. The idea was not to favor the rich, but give only those who contributed into the tax base a vote. And since property taxes were the primary means of taxation at the time, well......|`|oKvyaIPSaa	Only free white men and not indentured servants who owned a certain amount of property.
MU9cKqEpaa	I can't speak on behalf of the Marines but I can on the Air Force. The Air Force from my knowledge is very female friendly. There are very few jobs that prohibit women,not so sure about the Marines on that point. The experience you have depends on the job you choose. Everyone experience starts the same in basic, which is a hell of a lot easier than the Marine basic, but very quickly begins to differ depending on the carrier field and base assignment. You could work on planes, work on electronic equipment, be security forces(cops), medical troop,  admin etc. The Air Force is much more versatile people think.  The Air Force also knows how to treat it's people. You'll be hard press to find some to say Marine facilities are better than the Air Force. Not to mention we deploy for 4 months while they for 12. They work harder we work smarter. You choice, either way thanks for you decision to serve.|`|1LB7ogU9aa	The air force is the office jobs of military. Marines are the out cast of the branches but with high respect. Me and my dad sometimes talk about how we lived in the military he's retired Air force and i did 7 1/2 years in the marines.
s1ZxSkQiaa	Sorry but you have signed a contract. If you breach that contract you will be held accountable. That means legal action. If you stop going to drill you will be considered AWOL. That means you can be arrested if you get a speeding ticket. That means you will have a permanent black mark on your record that will cost you future employment.     Now if you talk to your commander you may be able to skip a drill. Or you can let the new job know that you have a obligation that requires you to miss a weekend. You will have to deploy if your unit is called up however.    I strongly suggest NOT ruining your life for a possible career. The worst thing in my opinion is a "soldier" who betrays the trust of his fellow joes and dodges a deployment. That is a betrayal that has no equal.|`|OPAdZMRgaa	You can request to go into the ING (Inactive Guard). However, the amount of time you take off in an inactive status will be tacked on to the remainder of your obligation.  I have known many soldiers who have done this (police/fire academy) for a year or so because they needed to concentrate on their career.|`|CrmPWcgDaa	you can just stop going--dont drill and eventually they will drop you. You can also request a 60 day break--see if you can do an RST--make up drill for the month you missed. But if u totally dont want to drill anymore--just dont go. I have seen many people just stop going-- now, If you got a bonus and did not stay--they could cost u some $$$,

Which could mean a better America, and faster growing economy in the future. Our debt, with the package, is only around 60% of GDP. Not as bad as the 120% after WWII. But for it to work the money has to be spent fast. And over long term things like renewable energy, etc. Things that could benefit us in the future.     Don't believe what I just said?   Link: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/magazi...|`|p9rbEdpdaa	I think he sees pretty clearly, as do most Americans, that the Republican agenda just wasn't very good for the majority of us.

There is a plan, that you aren't bright enough to understand it doesn't mean that it is wrong.
6Fsliwlhaa	Did your recruiter go on line and see what you qualified for?  They have a system that allows them to get an idea what you can possibly qualify for using the Enlistment Standards Test.

Demanding American rights, while waving the Mexican flag, a very stupid thing to do.|`|AA10184465	Hey im mexican so that is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... rude!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|JPPxwbBHaa	Ummm, are you implying those flying the flags are illegal immigrants? So, are you also implying there is some sort of correct identity of Americans?  The answer to your question is America does not have a correct identity, and so no, I love people expressing their heritage, what's yours?|`|AA10504019	Come to Texas,you'll see Mexican license plates on a New Cadillac SUV.Up for some shopping with the poor white folks.|`|AA10473375	I don't mind it if they're just stating their heritage, but when they're not citizens, don't speak english, and aren't trying to do either but want the rights citizens have, then yes.  Why would they think the deserve the rights citizens have when they aren't citizens?  America has always been the "melting pot"- that means when u come here, u MELT and become part of the culture that already exists, not change what we r.  If it was so great in the country they came from that they want to make it that way here, then y didn't they just stay there? I also find it very interesting that we automatically deport people who come here illegally from every other country...so y don't we do the same for illegal immigrants from Mexico?|`|632de8dc54d84dc4c4d0ab831981d077aa	Yeah especially the illeagal ones!|`|AA10818401	THE WINDS OF CHANGE ARE GETTING STRONGER !!!|`|727d7e47afd7d0b1ceb01fdf824d755caa	You bet your sweet azz I am. They trample all over the American flag, sing our national anthem in Mexican and then want the same rights as those who live here legally. There should be a law that says if you spot a Mexican who can't speak English, you have the right to ask for their green card and if they can't produce it, you have the right to detain them until the authorities arrive! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!|`|8b1f760f49d76523b653a351be9247f7aa	Were you tired of school and dropped out in the third grade?  Mexico is part of North America, most of us knew by the fifth grade that this is a Continent, we live in the United States of America.  When living in the US it is appropriate to fly the US flag above any other, Mexicans have every right to display the flag.  In my neighborhood we have a auto shop with the Canadian and the US flag, an Italian Deli with the Italian flag and the US flag, do you also disagree with flying those flags... or are you just whining about Mexicans.. again?|`|jFuGEwdxaa	as  long as they fly old glory first and high, no problem, but if they waive it above ours then they need to be shot|`|ULnmLYqraa	I'm tired of pseudo-"patriotic" Americans blaming all our problems on Mexicans and other immigrants.

Look at it this way. What if we went in their house and demanded anything at all.  I haven't met a person yet who would put up with that. Maybe they can understand how wrong it would be to use their "stuff" and demand more; even so much as to demand that our rights are somehow more important than the rights of their children who are already in the house.|`|vzJMYjNoaa	I'm sick of anyone here illegally having any rights.

All you can do is make it VERY VERY hard, to do and drive off most of the Wackoloons , and dumb attempts. Ya know the ones.
fhABExlGaa	My first impulse was to say that it would be all but impossible to institute a draft under current circumstances. It's like pulling teeth to send more of those who have volunteered, let alone those who haven't. But since you dont want a debate about whether or not its constitutional etc. I will move on.    Secondly, I don't think it's fair to assume that those of us who have not joined the army aren't willing to fight for our country. I personally am not a member of the armed forces; however, if I were to be drafted I would, without resistance, fight for my country.     As for my thoughts on the war? I do not know if we should have invaded in the first place, but I believe that this war is being fought with good intentions. Something had to be done about 9/11. Bush was put in a lose-lose situation. If he had sat back and done nothing he would have been attacked relentlessly by the American people. And now that he has done something, he is being attacked relentlessly by the American people.     Did Bush do the right thing? Perhaps. All I know is that I shudder to think about what Al Gore and his administration would've done under the same circumstances.|`|32a13cc43a0212fa97f582a57f42edd4aa	A draft is a lose-lose situation.  The military doesn't want it, the people don't want it, and Congress doesn't want it.  The only time it would be practical would be if the very existance of the United States was in jeopardy.    In WWII (and Korea), you still had a generation of those who would serve if called.  Today, however, the current generation is much too concerned with "American Idol" and "Grand Theft Auto III" to be of much use to the military.  Draftees of today's generation would hurt the military more than it would help it.|`|AGbq9pcbaa	I would dodge.|`|65cbbef81f2ea11e4dd949bac23156f6aa	hyungbinkim, youre retarded.|`|9533fb9762ea928a05c72b30daee8021aa	I protested.  I was drafted.   I served.  I volunteered Airborne, because if I were going to war, I wanted to be surrounded by the best. I served in 3/325 of the 82d Airborne Division, 1970-1973.    I still feel the same now as I did then. If this nation can not raise enough volunteers to defend itself, then our society is too soul sick to deserve survival.|`|0sN5VCBqaa	The draft is the only way to re-Americanize our military! Our armed conflicts around the world has evolved into a huge drain on our national assets. The bush administration is out sourcing our militarizes needs to private contractors with no oversight. A lot of money is being made at our expense, if we knew how much, heads would roll. What we don't know does hurt Us! Wake Up America, before it's to late.|`|UqN8wicfaa	The weak would run and the brave would serve    To answer hyungbinkim, who would be an obvious clintax dodger, I received prior enlistment paper and tried to sign but seeing as I now have seizures the Corps doesn't exactly want me manning a 50 cal, understood?    your thoughts?|`|b1b878f58acc81bc1bb563fc7ab6432caa	Im in college, but I plan on enlisting for a couple of years in the army after college.  If there is a draft and the country is in desperate need of men, I would volunteer.  I love America.    Dont know that much about Afghanistan.    Iraq:  We thought Saddam had WMDs and planned to use them.  We knew he worked with Osama (there are videos of those two together).  He had already invaded Kuwait and attacked Israel.  We are fighting a war on terror, Saddam supports terrorism.  I still think going to Iraq is a good thing.  However, how we have fought the war and handled the war is bad.  We have been misled, we have fought the war not to conquer, but to be politically correct.  Before rebuilding, we should have wiped out the enemy utterly.  We started rebuilding too early.|`|c6zkOSZwaa	Why aren't you serving now Devil Dog. OH WAIT, YOU'RE WEAK ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN LOGIC.    Ahem, on a more serious note, I don't think blindly following what government officials tell you to do, regardless of whether you're in uniform or not, is very patriotic. I don't think I would serve on moral opposition to the point of the Iraq war. If I felt like we were in a legitimate war, I'll see you in the front lines.    *EDIT*    I was just kidding devil dog. Jeez people are uptight these days =/. No need to bring politicians into this especially considering how many people in the Bush Administration evaded the draft. Best not to throw stones when you live in a glass house ;p.    On a further note, I don't understand why people still think blindly serving your country regardless of whether its in a moral war or not is still considered patriotism. If you're driving along with a friend in his car and he's about to drive off a cliff, would you be a true friend if you just shut up and followed along?|`|WNlRzpDaaa	I feel that service should by compulsory anyway.  It does no one harm to serve their country.   I proudly did my time in the Army as a paratrooper in the 2/325 A.I.R., 82nd Airborne Division, Ft Bragg NC.  By having compulsory service, most Americans would understand what it means to serve and what it means to have good officials in office.  As far as the draft goes, I would gladly go back.  This time though I think I would go for the 75th Ranger Regiment.  If you have a problem serving your country, whether you believe why we are there or not, then leave.  Good men and women died so that you can enjoy the freedoms that you have, to include the right to blast me in this forum and make rude and crude comments about me.  I don't agree with a lot of what happens, but I vote in order to hopefully change that.  Even though I am not in the military today, I still continue to serve my community.  I am a paid firefighter/emt in the community in which I live and spent a good portion of my life.  I work long hours without much in the way of compensation, but I don't do this job for the money.  I do it for the love I feel for my community, the brotherhood, and because I actually enjoy helping people.  There are those who wouldn't understand even this.  This is something that makes me sad.  When did materialism ever enter into the equation of public good?  Where are the morals and values this country was founded on?  Have we become so obsessed with getting ahead that we fail to help those who need it most?|`|b0bc1ec5d87a3cdf337ee8fb8d47660baa	Thank god i'm Canadian.

If the parents is receiving SSDI,meaning they worked the required 10 years to receive benefits through SS,the minor children are entitled to receive dependent benefits until age 18 because of their parents disability.

Normally, benefits stop when children reach age 18 unless they are disabled. However, if the child is still a full-time student at a secondary (or elementary) school at age 18, benefits will continue until the child graduates or until two months after the child becomes age 19, whichever is first.     http://www.ssa.gov/dibplan/dfamily4.htm

I was amazed at the quality and accuracy I had with the Springfield XD in .40.    I was a dick and handled a lot of OIS cases and homicides. The .40 seems to do the job for urban sidearm work. The only round I found better was the .44 special for revolvers. I assume not an option for modern police.|`|ZQZCJmD1aa	I have used a sig sauer p226 .40 for years as my duty weapon. My department did extensive field research on this weapn and founf it to be extremely reliable, I would STRONGLY consider this eapon. For the money, it is best in class and you should be able to get one in your price range.I trust this weapon with my life. I've never even had a malfunction using junk range ammunition.|`|1XqmVsgwaa	Well, my personal favorite duty weapon is a Sig P226 in .40 caliber. It fits my hand like a glove and shoots like a dream. That comes at the a very steep price though (compared to Glock, Springfield ect).    Really though, a Glock 22 is the safest bet. I'm not the biggest fan of Glocks (they just don't fit my hand well), but they are solid weapons that will serve you reliably for years. Also the Glock 22 is the most common Law Enforcement weapon. So you will see it in a lot of holsters in most areas.    Aside from Glock, almost all major gun manufacturers make pistols designed as police duty weapons (Springfield, Ruger, HK, Glock, Taurus, Beretta, Sig, Smith and Wesson, ect). For the most part, they all are reliable, chambered in a variety of calibers (9mm, 357 sig, .40, .45 being the most common) and suitable for the task at hand. Check out all their offerings, test fire a few of them and pick what suits you the best.        Added: Just to agree with the people that like the Springfield, I have a .40 XD and it does seem to go in my hand a lot better than a Glock and the trigger seems smoother. Check one out if you aren't thrilled with Glock's offerings.|`|5tdKQjgBaa	You should try looking into the Springfield Armory .40 XD.  It comes highly rated for both durability and reliability, and is a big competitor to the Glock.  Interestingly, you will find it takes features from the Sig Sauer, Glock, and 1911.  I have included a number of links which detail the handgun itself.  It's worth a look, and it is priced in your range.  Best of luck!|`|ftELrRJraa	Glock 22 in .40.  You will not get a better weapon for the price.  High quality, accurate and dependable under all conditions.  It is also very user friendly for field service.  I have carried Glock pistols as primary and secondary duty weapons over 20 years and have never had a weapon related failure.  If you want a slightly longer barrel and sight radius look at the Glock 35 in .40.  same grip and magazine size, longer barrel.|`|AA11411302	the new spring field HD is a great weapon it comes in both full size and compact with added saftey via grip saftey trigger saftey like the golcks. they are and excelent gun. Turas aslo makes a good polymer gun for around 500 to 600. which is a good buy. I personaly would go glock due to they amount of after market items for duty gear.|`|7KZMMYjQaa	For the money, you can't beat the Glock model 22 .40 cal.. Extremely reliable and very accurate. I also find it to be a very comfortable firearm. Plus, you won't spend $700 on one. More like $450 range.|`|aInu1r54aa	Asking which handgun you should purchase for is kind of like asking what car you should purchase.  You are going to get a lot of different suggestions about what is the "best" one.  A great deal of it boils down to what weapon not only fits the department's parameter, but also what weapon specifically works for YOU.      I see a lot of suggestions for the Sig P229 and P226.  Both are excellent weapons and they come in 9mm, 357 sig, and .40 cal. I previously carried a P229 in .40 (I now carry a USP 45 for SWAT) while working patrol, but I also own a P226.  The 226 and 229 are very similar, with the exception of the 226 being a bit larger.  Advantage of the P226 is that it is larger; therefore it carries more rounds and it has a longer sighting plane/barrel for greater accuracy.  Advantage of the P229 is that it's accuracy is very very close to the P226 and it is still compact enough to carry off duty.      Other quality weapons for police work include the HK USP, Springfield XD and the Glocks.  Bottom line is that the majority (but not all) of handguns that are produced by the major handgun manufacturers are pretty darn good quality now days, so I suggest that you find a range that rents guns and/or find a friend that owns one of the major manufactuers and you fire a box or two of ammunition.  Buying a handgun is like buying a car in that you wouldn't just blindly purchase a car off of someone's suggestion, you would test drive it first to make sure it works for you.      As for caliber, don't get too wrapped up around the axle.  9mm, 40 cal, 45, 357 sig will all work just fine so long as you do your part in putting the round where it is supposed to be in the bad guy's body.  All the BS about a 9mm not being able to stop someone is just that...BS.  Of all the people that tell you this, ask them if they have ever shot someone or personally witnessed someone get hit with a 9mm and the bad guy just walked away.  Instead, they are going to tell you about how they heard that this is what happened or they read somewhere about how this happened.  Before becoming a cop, I was a Green Beret and I served in both sand boxes.  One of my fellow green beret's dropped a dude with his 9mm using military FMJ.  On the other hand, my junior gave a guy a burst from his M134 Mini-gun and they guy didn't drop immediately, he had to be hit with a second burst.  So what does that tell you?  Sometimes even multiple hits with by a 7.62x51mm may not drop a guy instantly.  Same goes for 45, 357 sig, 40 cal.  Shot placement is everything, so pick out which ever caliber YOU shoot well with.      If you do test fire a Sig and you the weapon fits you well, you might want to take a look at the factory recertified Sigs.  Many police department (mine included) turn their Sigs back to Sig Sauer for trade in credit to purchase newer models.  Sig takes these trade ins and they refurbish and recertifiy these weapons back to darn near new condition.  The advantage to these recertified weapons is that they are are cheaper than a new sig AND they come with a factory Sig warranty.  When you look at a gunshop display, you can usually identify a factory recertified Sig by the red tape around the grip.  If you don't see one, you can ask the gun shop if they can get them and get a price quote at the same time.      I wish you good luck with your weapons search and I would also like to welcome you to the ranks of the Law Enforcement brotherhood.|`|a9dd122f6e9e49753e088e4b5d0b3c65aa	Jasper said it best.  Look for the 5" tactical model in .40 cal.  Great gun for the price.    A couple of things though:      1.  It needs to fire, without mishap, every single time you pull the trigger.    2.  You need to hit the target, every single time you pull the trigger.    If you or your pistol fail in either, it isn't worth it.    And for those who say the 9mm has no stopping power I say this.  The FBI did a study of actual shootings over a 20 year period, pre .40 cal.  Part of the study showed the percentage of one shot stops.  9mm FMJ +P+ beat the .45 by a couple of percent.  The reason?  Likely due to the less recoil, weight and the fact a 9mm is easier to shoot, thus easier to hit a target.    Again, it does not matter if you choose a .50 ae Desert Eagle.  If you can't hit the broadside of a barn, knock down power is meaningless.|`|o3Z0Xrjsaa	I don't own a pistol but the ones I would like are the Beretta 92F 9mm or a Taurus PT-92 9mm. These two are my preferences but these do come in .40cal also. As for me, I have held the others listed by other answers and was not impressed by the Glock or SIG-Sauer, Ruger, Colt, Smith & Wesson, or Browning. To me these listed either looked like toy guns or cap guns and others too big or awkward in my hands.   I know everyone else is telling you Glock and SIG-Sauer but it is your personal choice. Test fire any or all of the above before just buying one as this will give you an idea of which weapon you like. Choose wisely as the weapon you get may save you one day, and if you don't like it it won't do you justice.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_92  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_PT92
CpTQagJOaa	I am sorry to hear about your dad, but if he was deported it is unlikely that he will be allowed back for at least 10 years. If you have the money, you can always find a good doctor to come to where you are. If not, does he have medical insurance? How would he pay even if he was here? Also while he was in America, the system does offer help for drinking problems, we have AA and rehabs here..better than nothing and they do help a lot of people. Anyway, I would try to find a good doctor for him where he is at now. Surely there must be at least one. Good luck.|`|AA10045620	If he was deported it was for good reasons.  He will not be allowed back into this country.  He should seek the medical help he needs in his own country and at their expense.      There is no way the USA government would pay for any of his medical expenses.|`|G4TJ8nibaa	He is a Mexican and was assaulted by Mexicans in Mexico, murdered in Mexico, and run over in Mexico. Why is it that you feel it is the fault of the US government? Do you think Mexico and Mexicans MIGHT have SOMETHING to do with it?  And if he is dead why does he need medical attention?|`|H7SQEM4Daa	How is it that he was stabbed to death and still needs medical attention?  He was deported,he is no longer welcome here. He will not be allowed to return for at least 10 years. Who would pay for his medical care here even if he were allowed?  Yes,it is fair. He chose to break the laws of this country severely enough to be deported and his residency taken away.
6Fsliwlhaa	If you already went through school then you can get up to $65,000 in loan repayment funds.  You can also work towards your masters while serving using Tuition Assistance.  You cannot get the GI Bill and use the Loan Repayment Program at the same time.  The only catch is that you get an honorable discharge.  If you get kicked out then you don't get your benefits.  Talk to a recruiter for more information.|`|8704d6bf53d5099969addcfa560ad9eaaa	The decision is yours, the military is not for everyone.  But if you do chose Air Force is the best and you can continue to go to college, while you are serving.  My daughter has already received her Associates and if you wait till you get out to go back to college you will get college credits for your service (Honorable discharge is required).  Good luck with your decision.|`|7fgATXX2aa	Although I am younger than you I am a member of the Navy for that exact same reason and yes the Navy can make you an officer if you have a four year degree and they will fully facilitate your study financially, except for your books. I would Highly recommend that you join the Navy. Also yes the G.I. bill will pay tuition, But even better than that while enlisted you can go to college and the Navy pays 100% tuition not including the gi bill after service.! i didn't believe that either but after i joined i was made a believer it is AWESOME! You are also automatically excepted wherever you are!|`|SkwdQLdVaa	You can get the GI Bill by joining in the military no matter which branch you join in.  The gi bill would pay for your classes and books.  It has a set maximum amount, i think right now it's in 40,000, you have to look it up.  you would have to pay 100 dollars a month for the first year of your service and it will be deducted automatically from your paycheck.  The only catch is that you have to serve your term and get discharged honorably.  There're some soldiers that I know that's about to get dishonorably discharged because they messed up and won't be able to get the gi bill although they've paid that 1200 for the first year and served their time|`|s1ZxSkQiaa	You could always go for a 68X in the Army. Mental Health Specialist. Sounds like it would be right up your alley. Honestly as far as the GI bill goes you might want to talk to your recruiter. They will be able to set you up with a program for your school.    If you do want to serve then by all means do so. If you still want to have a practice look into National Guard or a reserve component. I have found my enlistment to be fulfilling and have many good memories from my time in so far.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	After you have served a tour with the military and have paid into the G.I Bill, you can apply to the VA for education benefits. Keep in mind that there is a war or two going on right now and there is a better than average chance of you getting sent somewhere in or near a war zone. Since you are looking to go into clinical psychology, this would give you some first hand insight for future reference.   As far as my time in the military, I served in Vietnam. I'm disabled, both physically and mentally (nuttier than a can of peanuts actually). Saw sh*t no human should ever see. Went to places that were so beautiful, that if it had not been for the war I would have though I had found nirvana. There were times that made the bravest of men cry, of fear and sadness and of love and friendship. Joined a  brotherhood for life, remember the lives of lost brothers. Would I do it again? Yes.|`|eGFr38PKaa	The GI Bill will pay for your school.  There are some stipulations that you can read about at     http://www.army.mil/-news/2008/07/29/113...    I know in the Army you can also take part in a program called GoArmyEd or TA (tuition assistance).  It allows for $4500 a year, but a maximum of $250/credit hour.     As far as what branch, that depends.  Think about which one would benefit you.  I want to be a pilot, even though the typical choice would be Air Force, it is very difficult to obtain flight status in the AirForce and the network of the Army is very large.     Everyone's going to give you a "hell yeah" or "**** that" about each branch of the military, and usually for good reason.  The "**** yeahs" usually come from people who shouldn't have enlisted in the first place, or did something really stupid while they were in.    Good luck man
WyCmQBuvaa	Child support and cash assistance / food stamps / child care and medical are two seperate things.    Child support comes from the biological father.  Is her boyfriend the father of her child?  Or some other guy?    Cash assistance & other State assistance is different.  If you suspect fraud, which it looks like this is, contact your State Department of Economic Security or Child Support Services.  These State agencies are so understaffed and overwhelmed, it is hard to catch the scammers.  It is your duty to report them or her.  To receive State assistance, you have to list everyone in your household and the income of the household.  Just saying that she lives with her mom is fraud.  What else is she lying about.  I just reported someone who was using this money to buy drugs.  She also tried to sell her food stamps.  If you report them, they must investigate.  They need you to help them find the people who are defrauding the system.  There are a lot of people that need this money to take care of their kids, not buy themselves a new outfit.|`|hvFN0JLVaa	Call the police and get them involved.|`|kA237kT8aa	yes|`|vVTmJjJDaa	it's completely illegal....and they can't investigate everyone - however, if they receive an "anonymous tip", you can bet your bottom tax dollar that they WILL investigate the situation!|`|AA11789493	I don't know how else to say this but to say it--this is none of your concern.

Be grateful that YOU have a family to stay with.

I think of a neocon as a big spender who is part of the religious right.  Many of them were previously Democrats who left the Dems when they started taking up for abortion & gay rights.

8qqpB7Vsaa	I don't know about his personally, but the whole Iran Contra deal did involve the Reagan adminstration in the drug trade according to the CIA's inspector general:    _____________________________    In 1998, CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz published a two-volume report[35] that substantiated many of Webb's claims, and described how 50 contras and contra-related entities involved in the drug trade had been protected from law enforcement activity by the Reagan-Bush administration, and documented a cover-up of evidence relating to these activities. The report also showed that Oliver North and the NSC were aware of these activities. A report later that same year by the Justice Department Inspector General Michael Bromwich also came to similar conclusions.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_contra...  _____________________________    That article has links to the relevant congressional reports.  In fairness to North, similar things have gone on with our involvement in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia.    There must be an MBA somewhere whose job is to figure out whether a business will be more profitable if done legally or illegally, and then makes recommendations to major investors.    The BCCI scandal showed a similar connection between not just politicians, big business, and the drug trade, but also similar ties to terrorists.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Cre...|`|MoGopDNHaa	No he wasn't.Liberals were working hard to undermine President Reagan like they do now with President Bush.Anything to slur the President,anything to embolden our enemies,anything to hurt America|`|r3K7wbLlaa	Drugs were a side line.

Pretty interesting reading.  /s/  BobH|`|gN2dmu2aaa	CuteJenna     Get real, the Reagan administration was the first in US history to have people working in the Oval Office convicted of felonies (the current Bush administration was the second).     North and others were indeed involved in trading drugs for guns between Iran and Nicaragua.    Of course, Reagan was also instrumental in aiding Saddam Hussein (who, up until his death, still considered Reagan to be a great personal friend). Have you forgotten the lovey-dovey photo of Rumsfeld and Hussein from the 1980s? Reagan also sold the WMDs Saddam used to gas the Kurds (and Iranians during the Iran-Iraq war).    There truth is that you do not understand any of this, and you have no knowledge of the cultures, historical dynamics, or geopolitical realities of the4 Middle East  do you? You are just another ill-educated Bushbot who repeats the lunacy of your equally ignorant, and un-American, leadership.|`|0c91b79437b0e602213a070c2fc739d0aa	What's up with you and LtCol. North?

NY Penal Law reads like this: A person is guilty of rape in the second degree when: being 18 years old or more, he or she engages in sexual intercourse with another person LESS THAN 15 years old.     There are of course other sections for rape in the Penal Law, however non of them would apply to your situation.|`|WrDGhduxaa	In Texas if you are both underage then there is no  crime. If you turn 17, then you are legal. If your girl friend is within two years of  your age there is no crime.  In your situation you must wait until she turns 16, or you could go to jail, if someone reported this or she complained, which can happen if she is mad at  you for some reason.|`|F3UxxmrLaa	As statutes vary from state to state, I would suggest you check yours.

7BdOMd7Iaa	I am definitely not a fan of Bush or the Republican party but I'm sick of people making such a big deal out of Socialism. The Cold War got the United States into this obsession with Socialism. Everyone should stop obsessing over it. I mean, I like having a police department, a fire department, and libraries. Those are technically Socialist. Who cares? I mean, anything that involves helping anyone is automatically Socialism. It doesn't mean the red army is going to come marching in and everyone is going to have to work on a collective wheat field. To answer your question, screw the ultra rich wall street execs. They hurt a free competitive market just as much as too much government control. Money should go to small businesses. Who cares if someone says its Socialism. If it helps while also maintaining competition in a free market it doesn't really matter what you call it, does it? If you want real Socialism we could just let the state run all national business.|`|kH0IxFa9aa	Bush said everything but "Let them eat Cake".|`|BQdXnCcHaa	Congress voted for the war in Iraq, therefore it was done with your approval.    Bush did not outsource jobs. Democrats like Bill Gates outsource jobs.    The bail-out was a bipartisan bill (that's a big word that means both Democrats and Republicans).    To answer your question: No, none of your examples, including the only one you got correct, demonstrate that Bush and/or the GOP were socialists.    Besides, Obama is more of a fascist than a socialist.|`|FRpkuABlaa	Bush was just stupid to begin with.|`|eBRkh2HLaa	I have thought for awhile now that they have a lot of similarities. Remember the Bush Family has always supported the New World Order. And no I personally do not think they give a rat's behind about the people who put them there. They all, every side have their own agendas.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	They are closer to FASCIST than socialist.  True socialist care about the welfare of the people, which Bush/Republicans are not.  What they care about if the welfare of the corporations. Under Bush we've seen the merge of Corporate into segments of government in such a massive scale that even the segment that is the most sacred is breached.    Bush had the most people from lobbyist background in as his cabinet members.   It shouldn't come as a surprise when 17 of 24 cabinet members got lucrative positions and money for no work position (consultant work...meaning they don't go to office at all) for 119 companies, 65 lobbying firms and 40 firms that ACTUALLY LOBBY THE DEPARTMENT THEY HEADED  http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/po...    Bush Corporate welfare in managing the war is something people call war profiteering at best. When the number of contractors exceed the number of soldiers in a war, it's out of control.    Fascism is the merge of business and government. When he started using a for-profit organization like Blackwater to pacify and police American's population in New Orleans, it doesn't get farther than that.  http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Blackwater_m...  although you will be hard pressed to find mainstream media covering this news extensively.    When the government is so full of Oil people in the higher echelon, Dick Cheney, Condi Rice (as in Condoleeza Rice, the name of Chevron Oil Tanker) and Bush family are all in oil business.   Cheney visited the Saudis more times than any VP ever in US history.  Yet oil prices are the highest during their reign and Oil companies made the record profit years after years during their time in office (while receiving tax break and multitude of government money)    Fact that Gale Norton, the ex secretary of Interior (the person that is responsible in Oil companies drilling approval in US soils) now works for Dutch Shell is certainly not a co-incidence either if you ask me.  http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_49...    True Socialist will stay awake in a Representative meeting to help people suffering from natural disaster in California fire.  Dick Cheney, being a fascist, just sleep during that kind of meeting, but wide awake when it's time for the tax break for the rich session.  http://www.truthdig.com/avbooth/item/200...    Those buildings in Iraq is not a socialist program as much as it is a corporate welfare program, since we know who gets the contract there.      While Capitalism is probably the best economy system in the world right now. (Since there is no such thing as Socialist Utopia)  What we have under Bush was not a capitalism system, it was fascism mixed with ultra capitalism where no proper oversee was done.|`|e19ukSO0aa	They were plutocrats and wannabe oligarchs.|`|7e45ea9e2cad770cb7a1dd48907df0a9aa	Yes.

AA11626262	Everything that Obama said and promised during the election disturbed me. It was all feel-good, emotional drivel! It never was and never will have any reality in any of the problems that we face and any of the White House's decisions. Everything that he said that got everyone fired up and made them feel excited means nothing if his administration is not honest. All of his emphasis on "change" was a load. Washington will never change, and with some of those people calling the shots now, it will become worse.    Him and his fellow Democrats better get their act together fast before this gets worse. Daschle is one problem, the insane stimulus package is another. The lobbyists presence is a hypocritical and upsetting broken promise that will too be a problem for him. This is only the beginning...

McCain wasn born in Panama!    Summary  In June, the Obama campaign released a digitally scanned image of his birth certificate to quell speculative charges that he might not be a natural-born citizen. But the image prompted more blog-based skepticism about the document's authenticity. And recently, author Jerome Corsi, whose book attacks Obama, said in a TV interview that the birth certificate the campaign has is "fake."     We beg to differ. FactCheck.org staffers have now seen, touched, examined and photographed the original birth certificate. We conclude that it meets all of the requirements from the State Department for proving U.S. citizenship. Claims that the document lacks a raised seal or a signature are false. We have posted high-resolution photographs of the document as "supporting documents" to this article. Our conclusion: Obama was born in the U.S.A. just as he has always said.    Update, Nov. 1: The director of Hawaiis Department of Health confirmed Oct. 31 that Obama was born in Honolulu.    Analysis  Update Nov. 1: The Associated Press quoted Chiyome Fukino as saying that both she and the  registrar of vital statistics, Alvin Onaka, have personally verified that the health department holds Obama's original birth certificate.    Fukino also was quoted by several other news organizations. The Honolulu Advertiser quoted Fukino as saying the agency had been bombarded by requests, and that the registrar of statistics had even been called in at home in the middle of the night.    Honolulu Advertiser, Nov. 1 2008: "This has gotten ridiculous," state health director Dr. Chiyome Fukino said yesterday. "There are plenty of other, important things to focus on, like the economy, taxes, energy." . . . Will this be enough to quiet the doubters? "I hope so," Fukino said. "We need to get some work done."    Fukino said she has personally seen and verified that the Hawaii State Department of Health has Sen. Obamas original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures."     Since we first wrote about Obama's birth certificate on June 16, speculation on his citizenship has continued apace. Some claim that Obama posted a fake birth certificate to his Web page. That charge leaped from the blogosphere to the mainstream media earlier this week when Jerome Corsi, author of a book attacking Obama, repeated the claim in an Aug. 15 interview with Steve Doocy on Fox News.  http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/...

Also they dont do a full exam but they do check you for herpes and other visual diseases. You need to talk to your recruiter about it being alright to go to MEPS while you're on your period.

Radical means extreme. Extremists are radical. Not all liberals (very few, in fact) are radicals.    Some conservatives, such as skin-heads and Neo-Nazis are extremists.

Look it up.|`|Y8TS6Do0aa	"Liberalism" is leaning to the left on the political spectrum.    "Radicalism" is the extreme far left - attempting to bring change at all costs towards a certain future.

Our country was FOUNDED on liberalism!    "Modern liberalism has its roots in the Age of Enlightenment and rejects many foundational assumptions that dominated most earlier theories of government, such as the Divine Right of Kings, hereditary status, established religion, and economic protectionism. Liberals argued that economic systems based on free markets are more efficient and generate more prosperity.    The first liberal state was the United States of America, founded on the principle that "all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to insure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." This said, much of early liberal thought originated in and influenced the politics of The Netherlands, the United Kingdom and France. wiki    I don't like dumb questions but there seem to be a lot on here!|`|b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	That really depends if you consider "liberals" liberal.   Im an open minded guy, I should call myself a liberal but I dont because I dont want to be grouped with those who have taken the name.   The typical wannabe liberal is not liberal because they exhibit a good deal of hate and prejudice. Those kinds of people are closely linked to radicalism.   The Oklahoma City bombing could be classified as both radically liberal and radically conservative, although the main reason of being against "The Man" is obviously a radical liberal idea, the reasons for being against the government were typically radically conservative.   You cant just say one side is wrong, because nothing in life is black and white.|`|nODNjNY6aa	Radicalism is just as directly/indirectly related to liberals as it is to conservatives.
AA10344136	Scott's answer gives me pause for thought: Just how different IS America from Britain?  America was created to be FREE and DIFFERENT than Britain--totally clear of British rule.    Interesting how America is more parallel from it's native former homeland.    Constitutionally protected as an executive right, it really IS a power British rulers had ( and rarely ) used; an epic act of kindness, primarily done out of political favor when needed rather than sincere compassion.    Personally, I think the executive right of pardons should be taken out of the President's hands---and put into the hands of the Supreme Court.|`|QONFn7vXaa	Because sometimes (very rarely) they are needed.

Thank God Bush pardoned him!|`|AA11622716	Those who set up the government recognized that sometimes a purely legal remedy is inadequate.  A person has been treated in accordance with laws passed by congress, but it is still unfair.  Other times, the prez might recognize that society will be better served by releasing one from the consequences of his crime.  Recently, the prez commuted the sentences of two border guards who shot a fleeing criminal.

RESERVES ARE BEING SENT TO IRAQ AND ARE BEING MADE TO STAY THEIR FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE,    If you enlist in the Army Reserve for six years you may qualify for    Non-Prior Service Enlistment Bonuses  up to $20,000   Seasonal/Quick Ship Bonuses  up to $5,000   High School Sr. Bonuses  $1,000   Prior Service Incentives  up to $10,000   Army Reserve Prior Education Bonus  up to $4,000   Army Reserve Bonus For Civilian Skills  $5,000   Army Reserve Chaplain Bonus|`|AA10057599	IRL is right to an extent.  but even when i read the answer it looks like all those figures are additive.  their not.  so lets break it down.  Non-Prior Service Enlistment Bonuses totalling up to $20,000   Seasonal/Quick Ship Bonuses up to $5,000 (right now quick ship bonus' are not being made available)   High School Sr. Bonuses $1,000, the way this works is you get 1K for every month you are in HS and in the DEP a 1k bonus upon graduation is also provided.  again your total bonus amount for the reserves WILL NOT exceed 20K   Prior Service Incentives up to $10,000, most prior service arent getting bonus' except for those with critical skills that dont need to go back to AIT.   Army Reserve Prior Education Bonus up to $4,000, this applies to OCS only.   Army Reserve Bonus For Civilian Skills $5,000, again only if the civilan aquired skill is a critical MOS.   Army Reserve Chaplain Bonus, not even in a million right now is this being offered.    and all of this depends on how well you do on the ASVAB, the MOS you pick and term of service.  so if you scored a 38 on the ASVAB, while you are qualified to enlist you may see a significantly lower bonus if you see it at all.  generally scores 50 or above see the better bonus'.|`|5P3cHR4Taa	Dat'l be $2.50.|`|s1ZxSkQiaa	Depends on the MOS and the need for personnel.

82e62204f1233511508a75bdb7acf417aa	Members of Congress and the President get their health insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB). The benefits are a significant piece of their compensation package, and offer a richer menu of coverage than what is typically covered by Medicare.  Members of Congress also have given themselves a generous tax break, which lowers their taxable income on the portion of the premium that they pay.  the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the FEHB program offers working Members of Congress, retirees, and their survivors the widest selection of health plans in the country.  In addition to health insurance benefits, Members of Congress may also receive dental, vision, as well as long-term care benefits.  Generally the federal government (funded by the taxpayer) pays up to 75% of the health insurance premiums, and Members of Congress cover the other 25% out of their (taxpayer-funded) salaries.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	They have a choice of providers who are under the federal employees health care system.

c9efb9774c2c4a0a3e5040b9d214c4d7aa	It depends on the situation.  As anarchist Emma Goldman said, "Necessity knows no law, and the starving man has a natural right to a share of his neighbor's bread... Ask for work. If they do not give you work, ask for bread. If they do not give you work or bread, then take bread."    Clearly in this case, Goldman does not believe anyone has the right to stop a starving man who steals bread.    In general, however, anarchists do believe in everyone's right to protect each other's freedoms.  (In other words, instead of waiting for politicians or police officers to carry out the policies they want, anarchists will do it themselves - this is called direct action.)    However, in terms of protecting freedoms, anarchists see things in terms of oppressors and the oppressed.  They protect the freedoms of the oppressed, not the oppressors.  The starving man, in this case, is one of the oppressed, of course.    However, you can't really make much of a society where everyone runs around taking bread.  Anarchists instead encourage people to assume democratic control over the companies they work at, and democratic control over the farm land of the nation, and then use it themselves to produce things - thus there's no need to take bread from others and they don't have to worry about oppressors living off their hard work.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	I believe that's their philosophy.  They want chaos.  I haven't a clue who in the hell would want to be an Anarchist and have NO government at all.    But I don't think people who talk about wanting anarchy in this day and age really understand what anarchy really means.|`|GuTUQpSpaa	I'm assuming you're talking about an anarchist society here.    If it's true anarchy, there would be no government, no legal system and no police force.  You'd pretty much be stuck with vigilante-style justice.    If a group was formed to prevent theft and the like from being committed, it wouldn't be an anarchist society anymore.  The group would be a crude version of the government and police force, and the thing they're trying to prevent (theft, murder, etc.) would be crude versions of law.  That's one of the many problems with anarchy -- it would never last.  Groups of people would quickly band together with clearly defined leaders, setting rules and cultural norms.  Never mind the fact that humans are still too selfish and violent to be trusted in a world that has no rules...    In short:  Laws = rules. (Don't steal)  Government = counsel that sets the rules, makes decisions and represents the people's interests. (You and anyone else who decide that stealing is against the rules.)  Police = those who enforce the rules and punish the people who don't obey them. (The group that tracks down the person who stole from you.)|`|YFlGfj6daa	Property is theft. Share, dude.

Obama has only been in office for a couple of weeks.  You can't just wave a magical want and make everything perfect.    I do not know where all the tax cuts are being taken.  It looks to me like Obama has taken an overall view of the current economic situation and placed a few changes into the budget.    Another fact here.  The stock market has almost always dropped around the time of an election.  The drop usually lasts from 3 to 9 months. I believe our economy will be in better shape sometime between March and September of this year.

However, ethanol itself (which is the proper name for alcohol) has a shorter lifespan, only around 12ish hours, depending how much you drink.  Does the test specifically say that it's for drugs and alcohol, or does it only say 'drugs'?|`|R5LuKSUXaa	If it states it is just for drugs,  then it is just for drugs...

Where as there's plenty of nice places to visit in America, the people aren't always as witty. When coming here, you have to prepare yourself as if you're watching your 12 year old nephew.    I'm from New Jersey, which as you know is close to New York City, and Manhattan's an incredible place. It's really the one city in America that's unique. However, the other boroughs aren't that much more interesting than what's on the other side of the Hudson River. Brooklyn's not bad, but it's not Manhattan. You can go anywhere and do anything there. It's really expensive though. Isn't Tokyo, London and Paris too though? I guess you pay for what you get. Houston? What's so interesting about there? The Texan drawl? Well, maybe. I'll be honest, I visited Birmingham, Alabama, and people were friendly there. Two hours east was Atlanta though and there were more bums there than prostitutes in Atlantic City.    Anchorage, Alaska seems interesting too. I've always wanted to go to Alaska. Honestly, when it comes to American city's, I wouldn't pick NYC or DC because I've been there so many times, and Philly's barely worth recognizing for it's sleaziness. Chicago, Miami, Los Angeles and what other than Las Vegas? Sure, there's sleaze there too, but who doesn't love gambling? lol|`|zzVnIoHbaa	London, Sydney, Rome    Y'know, if you get a magic thing called a 'Passport', you can visit strange, foreign lands...known as 'The Rest of The World'    *sighs*|`|q9BItD25aa	You want Americans only to answer........?

eulMjLtPaa	Yes, there are people from many countries who are here illegally, including Ireland.      McCain believes there are about 50,000 Irish here illegally:  http://thinkprogress.org/2008/09/22/mcca...    The prime minister of Ireland spoke to Congress about rights for illegal Irish immigrants:  http://redblueamerica.com/blog/2008-04-3...    More info:  http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-o...|`|4WxJvc5Raa	1 in every 25 in the US are illegal. The Irish only make up a minuscule percentage of these. I think you need to concentrate on the Mexican border.|`|321517b8db292e8ce3489dc477fc7fb2aa	I believe there are illegal immigrants all over our country from millions of places in the world. As to how many who knows.    Your question of why is answered in why not? For someone looking to go some where, america is great place. If they work they do not have to pay taxes, they get to see the world and the only price that they will pay is if they are caught they are returned to where they came from.     Why would millions of explorers before Christopher Columbus embark on around the world missions? Why did Magellan sail around the world? Some people are just looking for something. Some people just want to get away from places.     And just because a country is or is not prominent has little to do whether an individual is or is not prominent. We see that here in the US.    I once worked with a man from Ireland. He said he loved it over, and had no intentions of ever returning. When I asked him what there was to do in Ireland, his only reply was "drink!".      Your obsession with this seems to be biased with wanting to live in Europe. And as far as illegal, who really cares?  Do you ever come to a rolling stop at a stop sign, speed down the highway anything over the limit, not use your blinker at some point, change lanes without signaling, park where you are not suppose to, or anything like that? Or in any other fashion do you break any law that you are aware of you just consider it  not significant so you dont worry about it?  I don't know why you have such a hard time understanding it. They want to live here. That simple. Just like the rich kid that has a chance at education at wealth and a nice job smokes pot everyday instead and goes to the pen when he gets older. If Ireland is so great why don't you go? I guess you don't go because you like it here in the States. Same with whoever else is here, either legally or illegally.      And about a visa, have you ever applied for one? It's not a credit card where you get instant approval and then can do anything you want. Many apply every year, and don't get one. Sometimes companies apply for temp visas for workers to come here and work. Large banks that want our money for survival applied for over 21,000 temp visas last year. They prob only got half of those, but it saved them around 10 to 30 thousand per employee because overseas labor is cheaper.    We are taught that it is illegal for immigrants to come here without a visa to live. They are not taught that in other countries like we are. We are raised on it, from the Cubans coming into to florida to mexicans across the border, we hear it almost every day. It seems more of a crime to live here illegally for us than to rob a bank. Other countries are not brought up this way in a lot of cases.|`|6pksPo7Zaa	No time to read all this, but I know an INCREDIBLY pretty Girl from Galway (where the prettiest girls come from) who worked for 3 years in Boston with no papers.|`|jWNcZ0zBaa	There's illegals from a lot of different countries, but people only like to attack the Hispanics.

AA11454606	"(WHAT DOES CRIMINAL USE OF A COMM. FAC. MEAN??)"    You sold smack in a phone booth.
3yXhtBSxaa	Jolson was popular between the teens-40s.  He died in 1950.    Ah, my darling Ally.  People in this day and age misinterpret what he did back then.  It's understandable.  I mean, the thought of a white Jew in black face seems pretty offensive.  And there were a lot of minstrels back then who made fun of blacks, put on stereotypical roles.  Jolson did not.    I used to think he was offensive until I really started to do some research.  I was appalled that a fellow Jew would have had the audacity to make fun of another minority (and we Jews WERE a minority back in Jolson's day).    He was a Republican Jew who stood up for the rights of black people.  He fought to get them rights.  He even refused to do some shows because they wouldn't allow black people onstage.  Which leads me to the reason he wore black face.  Many actors and singers did this back then because blacks were literally not allowed on stage or screen.  Jolson is known for it because he was one of the few who became world famous, a great entertainer.    At one point, he had more black fans than he did white ones!     My dear Al's act would not go over today because thank God people don't view blacks the same way they did back in the 20s.  Jolson and Bill "Bo Jangles" Robinson (his dear friend) would be so proud to see how far we have come.|`|DB7UMkGCaa	"How well do you think Al Jolson's act would go over today?"

You may have a chance with the unemployment office, if you can convince them you only made one mistake, for which you were warned, but then you were fired for it later.    Good luck.
IUXriZQJaa	The articles were the original body of the Constitution, and the amendments were necessary to bring all the states on board because some things were forgotten or neglected. Since then, that same amendment process has been used to modify our Constitution as needed.    This is why the "Living Document" school of thought is such a pipe dream and should be abandoned in the trash-heap of history. The Constitution is based upon an ORIGINAL INTENT interpretation, also known as Constructionist, not a LIVING DOCUMENT (or DE-constructionist) interpretation.    Under Original Intent, I can listen to my teacher on the first day of school and know what the rules will be on the last day, because they are based upon his original intent.    Under a Living Document interpretation, I can say 5 minutes later that it is okay to shoot spit wads and kick my neighbor's chair because after all, the rules change with the times to fit the new scenarios that arise and couldn't have been foreseen five whole minutes ago . . .     I had a prof in college who taught the living document theory and harped on it until I turned it on his words and had the whole class roaring with laughter. He got beet red, stormed out of the classroom and never again mentioned or attempted to advocate living document theses during our class.
3d732fe812c55b9e23a945f5ccd45859aa	Actually, it is slander. Move over "Criminal Justice major", this is called a tort and rests in our most important primary source of law; the Constitution.    Our Constitution, under the infamous First Amendment, proclaims freedom of speech but also protection against slander and libel.    "In law, defamation (also called calumny, libel, slander, and vilification) is the communication of a statement that makes a false claim, expressly stated or implied to be factual, that may give an individual, business, product, group, government or nation a negative image. Slander refers to a malicious, FALSE and DEFAMATORY spoken statement or report, while libel refers to any other form of communication such as written words or IMAGES."    Now you could sue, of course without the evidence or proof that you were not intoxicated, it will be uphill. Emotional distress is also viable, however the case is rather feckless. The rewards of going to court would most likely outweigh the benefits.|`|AA10206116	If you have picture of the vandalism of your car and a friend who kept a copy of the multimedia message, you could possibly pursue civil litigation for slander. However, it would be hard to prosecute a group of people doing it. You could get them banned from your job too. It's not a constructive work environment when people are bad mouthing you, and you boss would certainly agree.|`|AA11327241	If you can trace who took the picture and sent the mass emails you can sue them for slander. Yea, I know it sounds like over kill but taking someones money is the only way you can 1. get their attention and 2. get them to stop.|`|v4GLpEBqaa	State Laws vary, but for the most part there isn't much you can do. The police for the most part won't waste time trying to trace back where the photo came through multiple providers, unless you were underage and nude. Otherwise it isn't really worth their time, and there really isn't any harm in taking a photo and MMS'ing it to people. It is NOT slander, unless it was in some way altered to do so. I would talk to a store owner or manager about the employee who did it, and if you get your point across they may be the ones losing their job.    You probably pissed someone off, or people love to pick on you. You can find out who's doing it and file a harassment report to the police. If they are damaging personal property and trying to get you fired (I don't know how...), they may investigate more into the matter. Sounds like bad teenage hazing.|`|cmGds6qdaa	This would be impossible to convict in a court of law.

iWrOmQemaa	I'm assuming this is your homework, and I'm not doing this for you, but I'll give you some pointers.    Look at the articles of confederation and why they didn't work.  Compare it to our constitution and the need for a stronger national government.  You'll also need to look at a lot of the "implied powers"  that our government/president have that are not necessarily written anywhere.|`|9vvaFxEeaa	Much of the increased control of the federal government was possible as a result of the great depression as it relates to FDR's New Deal.  If you examine the judicial precedent regarding the Sup. Court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause over the past 80 or so years, you will see the judicial precedent and doctrine that has been used to justify the extension of power.    Concerning the use of grants and mandates to increase control, the federal government will use its taxing and spending power to get the states to volunteer to be bound by federal mandates that would not otherwise be constitutionally enforceable.  Examples include federal highway and commerce funding, funding for education, etc.

We refer to our Snipers as our Guardian Angels, meaning they serve with us in a Conflict Zone and on Combat Missions, but not all.    Yes Snipers are also assigned M16A4s as well as all other Marines.    Every Marine in our Corps is a Rifleman first then Sniper or whatever MOS(Military Occupational Specialty) second.    You have to qualify for the position after Boot Camp, around the time you are in your MOS school (the Enlisted Job you contracted with whatever Branch).|`|J9rj2JNzaa	the best advice i can give you is to research, research the marines then research marine scout snipers. to be a sniper in the marines you have to do boot camp, after that you can apply to become a sniper. that repuires a lot more work like learning about ballistics, camoflarge, remembering things for recon, team work. and to answer your other question you will probably need good eye sight to be able to see a person at 1000 yd through a 10x scope.|`|lLPIs7WFaa	this is the point where you go talk to a recruiter.  But dont be too disappointed if you dont make sniper.  They are very very selectiveabout who gets the training and even more selective about who passes.  Good luck.  If you want truly dangerous talk to an air force recruiter about the PJ's.  Para-Rescue Jumpers.  This unit is so tough that even former SEALS fail to make the grade.  If you want to be where the action is...getting shot at...look into Marine Force Recon, Navy SEALs or Army Airborne Rangers or Green Berets.  Or there is always the Legion Etranger...The French Foreign Legion. You can find out about them and how to get in online.|`|FKJaQXQLaa	Marine snipers are in their own platoon within Headquarters and Service Company.  They do not interact with the infantry units directly.  They consist of 2 man teams.  One being the Scout/sniper and the other being his spotter.  The sniper platoon supports the infantry by selectively engaging high value targets.  Namely the enemy commanders and their radio men.  Take out their leadership and communications and you really demoralize the enemy.  Why send in a platoon or company when 2 men can do just as much or more damage with a high degree of success.  Being a sniper in the USMC is a very difficult task.  You have to be in the very best physical shape.  You have to be an expert hunter.    You have to be an expert at camouflage and concealment.  You have to be in the USMC infantry to be a sniper.  The Scout/Sniper school in Camp Pendleton is one of the toughest schools in the military.  Quite a few marines wash out and have to retry.  The snipers carry and use a sniper rifle.  When I was in, they used the M40A1 7.62mm  sniper rifle.  I am not sure what they use now.  I had a few friends who were in my unit become snipers.  A great group of guys they were.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	Marine snipers conduct many missions two of which you have mentioned. They can be sent out on individual sniper missions or they can be used just like a machine gun team as a support element for an assault. Snipers typically use a specially designed sniper rifle.|`|nZBVbVbkaa	To my knowlege, snipers stay with their squad just like any other rifleman would, but are called out on special sniping missions as well - or may go with the squad with their sniper|`|CKQtOusTaa	You need a deep vision is maths.    Maths is used quite a lot in any type of marine subject / sniping.  You will need to do long maths equations in your head.    For example wind = an angle you need to pass to get to your target.

For going 26+ mph over the limit, the scheduled fine is $435 (which includes assessments on top of a $100 fine) in 2009.  Your fine will be within a few dollars of that. You probably will not be offered traffic school automatically at that speed, but you can go to court and ask for it.  If allowed, it will cost more, but keep the ticket off your record.|`|AA11513482	It can go as high as $10 for each mile over.

I had to go to court and was denied traffic school because of how fast I was going, I had my license suspended for 30 days, and I paid OVER $400 for the ticket.

WyCmQBuvaa	How did you find this person?  How did you get her false resident card? What other information is she using besides your name?    I was a victim of identity fraud.  They got all my info and made my life hell.  I first contacted my banks.  Closed all accounts, cancelled cards and set up new accounts with high security.  I then had to go through all my statements and indicate which charges weren't mine.  The bank investigates these.  I was able to get my money back that they tried to steal.  I contacted all the credit reporting agencies.  If someone tries to open up a new account in my name, I am notified immediately.  I filed a police report last when I had as much information as possible.  The total theft came to over $10,000.  I provided the police with copies of everything I had.      I never went to the district attorney.  Are you a resident?  Are you a citizen?  I don't know how this works, but I am sure INS would like to know about this.  If she is not a legal resident, she could be deported.  See what damage she has done with your identity.

The easiest thing for you to do is go to your local police station and see what they can do in terms of directing you, or get in touch with the DA's office, as people have been saying. Do it before they can ruin your life, quite literally, identity theft is no joke.|`|L5IsUhacaa	Call the police. The police report goes a long way when you have factual evidence in case you sue the person for fraudulent expenses. I would first put a freeze on all of my accounts, and place a secure password for any expenditures over a set amount. I would have the bank prepare statements of pass expenditures that can be accounted for. I would then petition the court for any possibly legal ramifications, such as the statute of limitations to file to sue a person using your identity. With all this evidence, you maybe able to convince your local DA's office to pick up your case.

d718e68db0e03feea7b7b84e8684264daa	The National Guard is a Reserve Component of the Standing Army, formed under the power of Congress "To raise and support Armies".    The National Guard is a select militia, like the Second Amendment was passed to defend against.    "Congress may give us a select militia which will, in fact, be a standing army - or Congress, afraid of a general militia, may say there shall be no militia at all. When a select militia is formed, the people in general may be disarmed."    -John Smilie|`|nfXbqCgZaa	You are only partially correct.  The National Guard Mobilization Act of 1933 made it where the National Guard can be ordered into military service by Congress.  Additionally, the National Defense Act of 1916 gave the President the authority to activate the National Guard in times of war and national emergency.    States have never been "free and independent."  The Constitution clearly states, in the 10th Amendment, "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."    So they are obviously not independent, they are only as independent as the Constitution says they are.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Yes, they have lost it.  Most citizens today are spoiled and sheltered, ivory tower elite, lazy cowards.  They want someone else to do everything and pay for everything.    The National Guard has the responsibility to protect their state and the country. The Guard can be called out instantly, by the governor of their state. They are charged with being ready to assemble at a moments notice.    All able bodied males (now females also) have the Constitutional responsibility to keep minimal military arms for aiding the National Guard at such times, or fighting them if they are used to abuse us. Read Federalist Paper No. 29 titled: "Concerning the Militia." Pay particular attention to the concerns of the "republicans." Those were the anti-Federalists, the opponents of Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Party.    The Federalists, favoring merchants and banks, called for the constitutional convention because they wanted state borders opened to their out-of-state businesses and they wanted national access to state militias for fighting rebellions like Shays' against Massachusetts banks.  There was no federal army then, and all able-bodied males were obligated to state militia service, and we still are.    Alexander Hamilton, the Federalist Party leader, wanted  "well regulated [fully trained and equipped] select corps of the young and ardent" (see Federalist Paper No. 29).  The anti-Federalists feared, and didn't want, that formal militia and wanted to remain with only a citizens militia of all ages.  They were concerned the "young and ardent" would be "too readily influenced by arbitrary power."    The anti-Federalists  created our Bill of Rights and demand its institution, or they wouldn't accept the new constitution the Federalists wanted.  It's Second amendment dedicated (as Hamilton convinced them it could be) to it's first responsibility for fighting the federal government to protect a state's autonomy, and the people to keep military arms for fighting against it, or with it, as necessary.    As I noted, the "people" are now lazy cowards, they don't keep or even know how to use military weapons, and wouldn't put down their beer and walk away from the television long enough to save their state, nor the country, even from tax-sucking racketeer politicians now bleeding them.    Hopefully there's still enough of us -- ten million's probably enough -- to form three-man fire team cells.  Those are highly effective against any forces when they are dispersed and converge on them.

OfPQVR1Naa	Actually, no.    In fact, the Social Security Administration maintains a "Death Master File" of every person who has been reported as dead and what their SSN was.  (There are presently over 83 Million entries).    Even in this day of "Identity Theft", once a person is reported to the Social Security Administration as deceased, they release not only the person's name and Social Security number, but you can even order a copy of the person's original SSN application form (SS-5) which contains a multitude of genological information.    The reason this information is given out so easily, is that once a person dies they are no longer protected by Identity Theft laws, and since this information is "government record", it must be made available in accordance with the "Freedom of Information Act".  The "Death Master File" is used to prevent fraud so that no one can steal a dead person's identity or take-out credit cards in the name of a dead person.    Which is why they NEVER reuse Social Security numbers...      ....contrary to some people who like to pull answers out of their back ends without taking time to research them first.      The "Death Master File" is protected by the Social Security Administration, but a database has been created called the "Social Security Death Index" which is accessable through many geneology web sites if you are interested in researching information on a dead person.  The database is searchable by many different criteria.|`|AuWHIJPKaa	They wait until the SSN can be cleared from the person who held it, but eventually yes.

I feel that N. Korea won't do anything. I feel Iran and Syria may want to get more into the insurgency business by hiring their oppressed poor, including Afghanis. We will just keep fighting off insurgents. I have a good friend from Iran who thinks that if Iraqs economy picks up, as it should, without terrorism of innocent to stop it, Irans youth will want what Iraq has, lkie Afghanistan wants now too. He si presently, with paranoia, also buying Iraqi Dinar...lol Russia and China have too many oil, interests in iran to get DIRECTLY involved. Noone struck Israel when they fought back lebanon, that tells you something. Israel would crush Syria and Lebanon militarily, very quickly. Japan alone (besides us, Britain, S. Korea) would crush N. Korea. And Iran would be done within a month. My Irani friend said most Iranis secretly WANT a capatalistic society, but they don't want to get "sang-sarred" for saying so. > It is my opinion that maybe some of the above mentioned may happen, but more than likely, the iraqi economy will just fluorish, and other countries will make threats so THEY can have a better economy too. Realize, they don't have what WE realize as even POLICE in Iran (the way we know it) or social security, or ALOT of things. Also, from EXTREMELY good sources, the death count of Iraqi since the war is around 50,000-sad-but compare that to our civil war. AND, look at what happened yesterday!!! Innocent teen girls and below age ten girls kidnapped and killed by terrorists???? HOW are these people dying? From direct orders of Oppressors, that's how. And how do they get them to do it?, not with religion. With promises. As soon as the oppressed terrorists figure out that REGARDLESS of religion, the promise of FREEDOM and PROSPERITY (food, water and non-oppressive leadership included) is ALOT longer lasting than a run and gun of innocents, they'll come around........but as to hillary's comment.......................... Bin Laden Invited to the White House?   Christopher Ruddy  Thursday, June 6, 2002   Osama Bin Laden Invited to the White House!  Now that sounds more than far-fetched. And certainly President Bush would rather see bin Laden's head on a platter than to have him as a dinner guest.    But a senior former CIA agent who served in the Middle East for almost two decades fighting terrorists thinks that bin Laden may believe that, like fellow terrorist leader Yasser Arafat, he may find himself someday a guest of a future U.S. president.     This former CIA officer, Robert Baer, recently wrote the explosive book "See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism."     Baer writes that when he sees Arafat "standing in the Rose Garden at the White House or when I hear that a CIA director has met privately with him at some desert tent, I wonder sometimes if Arafat's example doesn't make Osama bin Laden consider that he, too, might become a statesman in time."    Baer's point seems fantastic. However, we now know for a certainty that Arafat has masterminded and backed too many terrorist acts to count, from the Munich massacre to jet hijackings and worse.     A veteran of the Mideast, Baer knows Arafat. Baer writes that while "terrorist organizations operate like the most complicated interlocking directorate ever created," he discovered that many of the trails of these groups and their activities "converge at the feet of Yasser Arafat."    Yet today our liberal media prefer to describe Arafat as a freedom fighter. Baer's observations are deemed politically incorrect.     That may be one reason his book, with many important revelations, with a foreword by Seymour Hersh and published by Random House, has gotten such little media attention since it hit bookstores earlier this year.    Perhaps a companion book might have been titled: "Speak No Evil: Why A Veteran CIA Officer Should Keep His Mouth Shout About How Bill Clinton Undermined America's National Security."    While Baer fairly criticizes problems in the CIA and its handling of terrorism from the days of the Reagan and Bush administrations, he also clearly shows that the infrastructure of the CIA's ability to fight terrorism completely collapsed under Bill Clinton.     Here are just some of Baer's key points:     In 1991, the CIA closed up its activities in Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. During the Clinton years things got even worse, when CIA operatives around the globe were directed away from spying on the bad guys and told to start worrying about "human rights, economic globalization, the Arab-Israel conflict." By 1995, the Clinton administration thought spy operations were so unimportant that a CIA analyst who had never served as a spy or even overseas was made director of operations, the CIA's chief spy.     Iran remains a major player in the terrorist world. Baer says that in 1982, Arafat "had put his entire worldwide terrorist network at Iran's disposal." Baer believes that the Iranians were clearly the culprits behind the bombings of the U.S. Embassy and Marine barracks in the early 1980s. In 1996, bin Laden formed an alliance with Iran. The purpose of the alliance was simple: Attack America.     The Clinton White House's gross negligence and malfeasance was demonstrated by its handling of Saddam Hussein. Baer states that in 1995, top staffers at the National Security Council prevented a planned coup by Iraqi military leaders against Saddam Hussein. Baer was the top CIA man in Northern Iraq working with Iraqi dissidents.   Baer also reveals just how much the Clinton White House sought to protect Hussein.   In 1995 Baer was summoned by the CIA back from Iraq to Washington.

Possible candidate would be US and allies. It is widely believe that they don't have capability to hit US with nuclear weapon, but wrong. They do have capability to hit US which is why we warned them that any nuclear explosion in US or it's allies will be assumed that it's their doing. Why is that? The uncertainty of nuclear testing by North Korea has brought us questions. As of now it is confirmed that it is nuclear test. We do not know why it has small magnitude of explosion. We can conclude that the test was either dud or it is possible that it's a small nuclear bomb capable of mounting to missile or possible portable nuclear bomb. It means that the bomb was designed to be small that you can carry as well as fit in to the missiles. If North Korea can not reach US by missiles, it's possible that they will adopt the means of smuggling such bombs to US and it's allies. If you look at the past news, there has been report of North Korean spies and commandos has been spotted and etc. in South Korea. Also there are some pro-North Korean that lives in Japan. I have not seen news in regards to spies/pro North Koreans here in US, but I am sure there are some people here. We can easily destroy them, but they do have capability to cripple us if we can not do so with precision.

The insurgency, however, is aimed mainly at innocent people, like today, with the kidnapping of teenagers, and children, and killing of innocent people trying to run a press station>>> (of ALL sects of religion within that country-that were killed within this press related killing)-which will only deepen not only the peoples of iraqs resentment at their freedoms, and safety being taken away, remember their Vice president has already lost three siblings-BUT-from VERY good sources, the total of iraqi deaths stands at about 50,000....but still, how? And by whom? The peace that will be given effort at maintaining in Iraq, and building infrastructure and economy will only pick up, enliven, and excite, not only the iraqi people to keep standing up for a MUCH better life than they had under Saddams reign, but also, Iran, we will leave alone (outside of fighting off sent terrorists of the innocent, that they wish to control)-and soon too, it is my belief, and an Irani friend of mines, that the younger irani generation will want the same growth and freedoms that will slowly but surely seep into Iraq.     Also, an extremely good book to find out what is REALLY going on over there, and was, is "See No Evil" by Robert Baer....ex CIA

Unfortunately, that's a big reason that Obama got elected - there's a part of the nation out there that actually thinks he's going to pass legislation to support them without them having to work at a job at all.  Lunacy at its best, and those people are in for one heck of a rude awakening.    As for the US being respected when "Slick Willy" Clinton was in office...yeah, right.  The other nations of the world really respected a guy who gets a BJ while in office, gets caught at it, lies about it under oath, and then becomes only the second president in US history to be impeached.  Yeah, right!    And before all you Clintonites out there starting whining and crying about Clinton not being impeached, I suggest you look up the impeachment process on Wikipedia and educate yourself before you open your mouths and stick your colletive foot in it.    Oh, and Romare....your beloved "Slick Willy" wasn't impeached because he got a BJ in the White House.  He was impeached because he lied about it under oath while giving a deposition....you remember the line, I'm sure, the one that went, "I did not have sex with that woman!"  Lying under oath is a crime called PERJURY, and that's what he was impeached for.    And now, I guess, you'll respond with the tired old Clinton-supporter line/lie that "oral sex isn't sex."

9tcv3TiWaa	Deployment and Stationed/Based are two different things.  Stationed means he is assigned to a command at a certain base.  That is where he is based out of, reports to, medical, dental, etc... Deployment means that he (including the unit) leaves the base to go to another location for a certain length of time.    You can never go with him on Deployment, no spouse or family member can.  If he is stationed at a base then you can be there as long as he has accompanied orders.  In the lower 48 (CONUS) all orders are accompanied unless he will be going to school or training less than 22 weeks.  OCONUS (Alaska, Hawaii, US Territories, and foreign country) can be accompanied as well as unaccompanied orders.  It will depend on where he is going and for how long.  An example is Korea, usually orders for there are 12 months, so it is unaccompanied orders.  He can put in a request to get them changed in which you would have to undergo an EFMP (medical & dental) screening  and if it is done then you can go.|`|tDZMJue9aa	deploying is different than pcsing or  moving somewhere...deploying means he is in a war zone normally..pcsing or moving means his new base will be in germany arizona hawaii or somewhere like that..why would you want to deploy with him? he will not have time for you and its simply not allowed|`|XbIoIUclaa	It depends on a lot of things.

Some are paranoid conspiracy theorists; others sincerely believe that Obama is a danger to America as they know it; others simply and sincerely believe that Obama is a closet communist or something like that.      What do you plan to do with your life?  What responsibility do you have to your country?  The second question is not one that in my experience many kids ask themselves with any seriousness, and they discard options that are not immediately comfortable.  They are entitled to their opinions.  It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy though... the degree of Obama hatred is such that I fear for attempts on his life by misguided "patriots".  I don't know that this would bring chaos and turmoil, but expect that it might.    My other fear is that the sunshine supporters who like the idea of Obama as president will just go on their merry way without putting themselves out to actually work on solutions... to not only think outside of the box but act and plan ahead and work at achieving a better America.  Hope people don't shoot me down for believing that there is room for improvement.    What do you intend to do with your life?  Does serving your country play any role in your plans?  Is it  all about making money and being entertained?  Are these bad or unfair questions?|`|a7gdFHhraa	Because all you ignorant toads do not study history and the repercussion of disarming the common law abiding citizen.

People stock up on ammo because it might not be readily available one day when you need it and speculation to rising cost/taxes on it. We buy certain magazines and firearms recently because since democrats are in charge again we might see another ban on "assault" rifles or high capacity handguns like it happened in the clinton administration despite the FBI census a year or so back stating that "assualt" rifles accounted for less than 2.8% of armed crimes. It's not the movies, robbers don't rob stores with 2,000 dollar Mp5's or highend Ar15's. They use cheap, 380cal small capacity handguns that are readily available (Top weapon used in the census).

In certain areas it depends upon agreement between the member states. However, it also has supranational bodies, able to make decisions without unanimity between all national governments. Important institutions and bodies of the EU include the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, the European Council, the European Court of Justice and the European Central Bank.

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	False.  Violent crime rates are actually HIGHER in death penalty jurisdictions. This may seem counterintuitive, and there are many theories about why this is (Ted Bundy saw it as a challenge, so he chose Florida  the most active execution state at the time  to carry out his final murder spree).     It is probably due, at least in part, to the high cost (capital punishment is MUCH more expensive than life imprisonment), which drains resources from police departments, drug treatment programs, education, and other government services that help prevent crime.     Personally, I think it also has to do with the hypocrisy of taking a stand against murderby killing people. The government fosters a culture of violence by saying, do as I say, not as I do.|`|2uINYiMfaa	no, I think anyone who would do something that can call for capital punishment is so crazy that nothing you do will stop him or her.     plus most people would rather die then spend life in jail

X4kSnB4gaa	I would say no that's definitely not true. Not EVERY woman gets raped. That's ridiculous. It does happen though unfortunately. I was never physically assaulted as a woman in the military, although at times I have been verbally harassed and had to put up with quite a bit of sexual harassment, jokes and innuendos. As a woman in a man's world, it is just something we have to deal with, as sad as it is.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	This is news to me and I gave 7 years of my life to the NAVY SEALS Recon squad.|`|3f52d29b3acdfe08f6df1f86ebe1eaa8aa	It does happen in the Military but not as often as people would like you to think. The numbers for rape in the civilian world and in the military are very close. With the numbers slightly higher in the military. Naturally because there are more men then there are women and the ratio men to women is higher than it would be in the civilian world. With that you also have a slightly increased number of false reports as well. Happened to one of the guys I worked with on the ship. (not saying all are false reports just that numbers on both sides are going to be higher due to the difference in the ratio.)    Wow I used the word ratio alot in the this.|`|1LB7ogU9aa	Not all women but it happens.|`|FmEsMOKVaa	yes..it does happen. Most of the time the military covers it up.  But sexual harassment if far more common. A lot of male officers and high ranking seargents show up to enlisted female barracks and try to hook up.     Once a guy pulled rank on a girl that just turned him down. I stuck around so she had a witness. He tried to say she was disrespectful which was a lie.    Some rape stories are too brutal and gruesome to repeat them here but I don't recall them happening all the time. It happened on every base I've been on though but not like every week or something off the scale.    But sexual harassment ...that happens quite a lot. The thing is the guys that do it are usually very intimadating and women are too scared to say something.     But ....the funny thing is...if a guy is a dork and said a joke....but he is harmless...women make complaints.     I don't understand chicks....they don't have the balls to make complaints against the very aggressive guys. They end up trying to get thrown out of the military or something stupid to get away from them.

There is no gender discrimination.  I was a Unit Victim Advocate for my unit.  More females will report rape than men.  THAT is a fact.      Rape is human nature of the ugliest kind.  To say that it always happens in the military is a falsehood because it happens ANY WHERE, ANY TIME, ANY PLACE to ANY ONE.      There was a case at Ft Hood where a Platoon Sergeant threw a welcoming home party for his platoon at his house.  This particular SFC was not liked very well but Soldiers still attended.  Towards the late evening hours after a while of drinking beyond coherence, that SFC ended up getting gang raped by his Soldiers.    Maybe your uncle is trying to scare you from not joining the Army...JMHO.

"You've heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession," he said, noting that growth has held up at about 1 percent despite all the publicity over losing jobs to India, China, illegal immigration, housing and credit problems and record oil prices. "We may have a recession; we haven't had one yet."    "We have sort of become a nation of whiners," he said. "You just hear this constant whining, complaining about a loss of competitiveness, America in decline" despite a major export boom that is the primary reason that growth continues in the economy, he said.

ZUKz3XDvaa	Someone's seat?    After Senator Clinton (from New York) was selected for his choice for Secretary of State, people started speculating about who would fill her vacant senate seat.  Because, that's what people do.  This was of course before President Obama had taken office and before Senator Clinton was confirmed and there was a seat to be vacant.          Who is she related to?    Caroline Kennedy is the daughter of , the daughter of President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy and their only surviving child.  She is the nephew of Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy.  There's a good Kennedy family tree here: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kennedys/sf... (if the flash doesn't work, there's a text only version too)          In re the office:    Caroline Kennedy was one of many names that surfaced during the "who's on first" period where everyone was speculating something else everyday--who would selected for what position, who would be appointed to what seats, whether Minnesota would ever finish counting their votes.  She did take interviews at the time her name floated around and said that she would be interested in the position.  She drew criticism from some media outlets for lacking clarity in interviews, and for using the phrase "you know" 168 times during a 30 minute interview.  On January 22, she pulled her name from consideration for the seat, citing personal reasons.  Governor Paterson selected congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand to fill the senate seat until the special election which will be held in 2010 to fill the seat until the next regular election in 2012.        What does she do?    She's an attorney, a writer, an editor and serves on the boards of numerous non-profit organizations.  She worked as director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships for the New York City Department of Education (she helped raise more than $65 million for the citys public schools).  She currently serves as one of two vice chairs of the board of directors of The Fund for Public Schools, a public-private partnership founded in 2002 to attract private funding for public schools in New York City.    I could go on, but since I didn't even bother to look for articles from the recent election (Mr. Obama's)--I just went to wikipedia.  Why don't you start there....it's one thing if googling turns up nothing, but you didn't even have to do that--Caroline Kennedy actually has a pretty good Wikipedia article that's well sourced and up to date.|`|AA10691319	she wanted to be given sen. clintons seat from new york.  her only experiance was that he dad was president.|`|70503caf06f4695beca81e8a95fd439aaa	Caroline Kennedy is the daughter of John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Onassis Kennedy.     She had initially vied for the position of junior senator of the State of New York, made vacant by Hillary Clinton's nomination as secretary of state, but soon dropped out of the race, citing personal reasons.    She has made a career as an attorney, writer, editor, and has served a number of non-profit organizations, specifically public schools in New York State.    Her husband is businessman Edwin Schlossberg who, like Caroline, is primarily involved in non-profit work, but has never been involved in politics. John F was her father, whose assassination occurred when she was about 6 years old.    And a small tidbit, the Neil Diamond song "Sweet Caroline" was written in honor of Caroline Kennedy    EDIT wow... thumbs down already? I guess someone isn't a Neil Diamond fan... or a fan of factual truth, for that matter.|`|fPMVuB87aa	dunnno|`|AA11285960	she wanted hillary clinton's NY senate seat (hillary is now the sec. of state, leaving her senate seat empty)|`|5zJq5XJoaa	mine|`|NqNbIp2caa	She was contemplating the NY Senate position vacated by Hillary Clinton when she was nominated to be Secretary of State.

Z4PxfObXaa	Well I guess I wouldn't know for sure, since I've never been a part of either one of them.  But in my opinion, they're equally important.  They are both working toward the same cause.  Go for whichever one you are more interested in.  Talk to people who have actually been a part of the Marines or the Navy.  And as for what you would do afterward for a job--that's really up to you and whatever you are passionate about.|`|vKxt1i0Faa	You are not very smart, are you.|`|npMVWV7raa	Typical ppl who don't know about the Marines will say that. It depends on what you wanna do. The number of jobs in the USMC are more limited than that of other services. I've known other Marines (active and reserves) who are out who have good civilian jobs because they actually work hard and plan for it, regardless if their MOS is applicable to most civilian jobs or not. It's not the branch that will make you become successful- it's you.|`|7fgATXX2aa	Now i wouldnt say the Marines are"dumb" They are preaty wesome at what they do, but as your last question stated there wouldnt be much to do after the marines. As a member of the navy i can tell you there are A TON of advancement opportunists *if you are willing to go get them* its not all easy but it is possible. For instance you can go to basic training as an E-3 if ou bust you but in D.E.P. (delayed Entree Program) and then by the time you deploy you could bee up to e-4 (petty officer 3rd class). There is also much better job experience opportunity not to mention better pay and benefits while enlisted.|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	With the Marines on your resume you'd could get a job anywhere. Although they do alot of brainwashing to their enlisted ranks and at boot camp, the reason for it is so they can train you to become "a rifleman first" because EVERY Marine is a rifleman. The thing is when they send in the Marines to do a job not as many die as if they were to send in the Army; they are more well trained at combat. Go look for the Discovery Channel's documentary "Making Marines" if you're interested in what boot camp is like.    The Navy is just as commendable as the Marines too. Any service really is. Inside the Navy you might have more job opportunities than the Marines. The Navy is much bigger and has lots of technical careers if that interests you. Either way you're going to have to do a mandatory 6 month leave on a ship, so if you're not ok with boats, then both services would be out for you, as well as the coast guard.|`|AA11261867	I you are a wuss....then join the Navy. Unless you want to be a Seal, then you better be tougher than ever!|`|lXsSmPugaa	navy|`|J6e9WPKFaa	Dude! Marines all the way they can brain wash you if you let them, but they are a lot tougher and can do a lot more then you think you can and the Marines show you how. When you become a Marine you actually have something to be proud of, but Navy on the other hand there is really nothing special about it anybody can join the Navy. When you become a Marine you can become a Fire Fighter a lot easier that is what I am going to do and also you get a lot more benefits when you become a Marine|`|5950b11aa7fc909533dc7655eada356aaa	You're kidding, right?    First of all, all branches of the military have a lot of job opportunities, many are the same across the board (admin, supply, truck mech etc). Each branch also have unique jobs within their ranks - that's just the way it is. And for this government, whenever they needed a fast-attack force ready to go and give their lives for freedom...it wasn't the Navy or Army they relied on ... it was the Marine Corps. Read your history books and learn about the battles of the Corps, such as Iwo Jima, in Vietnam, and the Devil Dogs of WWI.    I served in both the Navy and Marine Corps, and frankly, if it hadn't been for the training I recieved in both services, I would have never gotten the better jobs that I did throughout my career. I'm proud I served, but by far, the Marine Corps has a sense of pride and "Esprit de Corps" that NO ONE else has...and I speak from experience!|`|YnfOf3YKaa	Ok first of all Marines and Navy are part of the same department and marines offer the same oppurtunities as do the navy except you are better and quicker trained in Marines so Marines is more hands on|`|v6KSGrlJaa	Usmc all depends on what you do usually low svab score Marines get the simpler jobs like basic infantry or jobs that anyone can do.and 90% of these kids are 18+ so they are supposed  to be retarted alot of them never had a job .as the navy i would say likewise i meet crapload of people thinking they were gonna be navy seal cause they had a contract for the navy seal challenge and they ended up cleaning the ships not a smart move ..,but Navy has more money so if you for trying to get an education Navy its the way to go.

z88IMXNFaa	Judgment of foreclosure was granted.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	The judge favored the party that filed the case.|`|07YBD5mJaa	The word sustained is a past tense of the verb sustain. The verb has its origin in the Latin word sustinere which means 'to hold from the base'. It was modified by the Old French as sustenir. Then, it was adapted as sustenen by Middle English. In court, the term sustained means 'upheld the validity or correctness of'. For example: the judge sustained the objection of the prosecutor. It can be illustrated that the judge affirmed or favoured or accepted the doubt or protest offered the lawyer.    In court, this term sustained means backed, approved, bolstered, confirmed, endorsed, kept up, supported, validated or accepted as true or proper. The above instance occurs when one of the two lawyers raises a doubt over the clauses or points made by the other lawyer.|`|8ZoSSslFaa	it means that the charges where dropped the house is not in foreclosure anymore|`|QP7VyPV6aa	well there are two classifications along those lines. sustained, and overruled    over ruled means that the judge ruled against what the party making the assertion claims    sustained mean the judge agrees with, and therefore sustains, the party making the assertions claims.|`|m4G9jqgPaa	What it means, in plain English is that you lost the case.

AA11494150	The burden of proof required to make a traffic stop is "reasonable suspicion". This is a fairly low burden of proof.   It is defined as information causing a person of ordinary intelligence to suspect a violation of the law.    There are two legal requirements when it comes to stop signs. First, you must make a complete stop. Secondly, you must remain stopped until you can determine it is safe to proceed. It sounds like they got you on the second.    If you can get the reason for the stop thrown out, they must dismiss the insurance ticket by a legal principle called the "Exclusionary Rule" (also known as The Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine). However, as I mentioned, reasonable suspicion is a low burden of proof.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	she sounds like she had probable cause.  besides, she got major brownie points for the trainee..pulling over somebody for a minor traffic violation, then hitting the big time with a non insured driver.  your lucky your car did not get towed.|`|AA11285960	Absolutely plead NOT GUILTY on the ticket.  request a court date.  If the cop doesnt show up as a witness, you get off scott free. (Cops are no shows to court all the time, i've beat 3 tickets because of that). If the cop does show up, you need to prove that there was no way the cop had an unobstructed view of your car.  Take photos of the alleged stop sign and try and show that the cop was too far away or couldnt see your car from that angle.  Good luck!|`|5mCm2XTLaa	Yes it's illegal to pull someone over without probable cause. Trouble is how do you prove you were stopped for no reason? Your word against a sworn badge carrying peace officer...And it did turn out you were guilty of something. Try and work out some sort of payment schedule for your ticket. You're not going to beat this thing.     You're lucky you don't live in Los Angeles County otherwise you'd have had your license suspended and car impounded.|`|18167e6cb8bb213b37ad670e7870b7fdaa	Whatever he stopped you for, sounds like you got wrote up for no insurance.  And you just said you don't have it.  I don't think you're going to get out of paying that ticket.      If he wrote you up for the 'not looking' thing in addition to that, yeah you could contest that.  But if you end up in court admitting the insurance thing, the rest may not go your way.     I've been pulled over for excuses like that around here.  My experience is, if they don't find anything more serious to write you up about, they'll generally let you go.     You should make sure you're insured and have your card with you.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Why do you say "pulled over for nothing" and then tell us what you did wrong. You weren't "pulled over for nothing." You broke the law and on top, didn't have insurance. YOU are at fault, not the cop. Why is it everyone in here breaks the law and acts like they're the victim. TDoes the person you hit tomorrow care that you were planning on getting insurance at the end of the month? People like you have no business on the road. It's always the idiot like you who rearends me and says "well I was getting insurance at the end of the month."     I sincerely hope you lose your license.    Hope this helps.    PS - and the morons telling you to fight it because cops "are no shows all the time" are lying. Cops are not noshows, they get paid overtime to go to court and if they're not there, they reschedule - the person is lying. And you would have no case and your fine is for the no insurance.|`|CjkT6ZjNaa	the amount of the ticket isn't because of the traffic violation, it is the no car insurance; so don't plead not quilty...because you were guilty of not having car insurance, which is definitely against the law.|`|1XqmVsgwaa	No, officers can't stop you for absolutely nothing. However, the legal requirements to make a traffic stop are very low. Officers must have reasonable suspicion that a crime has occurred or is about to occur.    Officer's can stop you for *ANY* violation of the law, no matter how minor (unless state law prohibits the law being a primary offense, such as seatbelts in a few states). An example of this. My state law prohibits you from displaying a sticker of an auto club you don't belong to on your car......If you have an old AAA sticker on your car and I somehow have cause to believe you don't belong to AAA, I can stop you for that. Most officers don't get super nit-picky like that. But they are within their legal rights to do so.    That means if you don't obey the absolute letter of the law, officers can stop you. If the law says you have to stop at a stop sign for 2 seconds before moving and you only stopped for 1.9 seconds, they can stop you. If their city ordnance says you must look both ways and you didn't, the officer can stop you. If in the officers opinion, you didn't make a completely safe stop before preceding, he can stop you for that (though he has to prove his case in court).|`|a9dd122f6e9e49753e088e4b5d0b3c65aa	$550 for no insurance?  You must be in Washington State.  The best bet for you is to request a mitigation hearing, get insurance before the hearing and explain to the judge you had a lapse in insurance but made it right.  He should cut the ticket down to court costs.  At least they do in my county.

G4TJ8nibaa	If she has her green card she is free to leave the country. There are some things to take into consideration though. If she leaves for 6 months she will lose her "continuous residency" for citizenship. If she stays out for over a year she need to get a re-entry permit BEFORE she leaves the country or she will lose her green card. If she stays out 2 years she will lose her green card. If she trys to go back and forth too many times(spends too much time in Japan) she may lose her green card. If she wants to visit her mother for a month or two it shouldn't be a problem.

My husband and I actually moved out of country 4 months after we married.  He was in the process of residency status and we processed at the embassy in the country where I was working.      Before we moved overseas for two years we went back to his home for a two week vacation.  It was not a big deal.  He just couldn't be gone for extended periods.    If you are using a lawyer for the paperwork talk to them about a short trip home, I think the limit is two weeks.  If not talk to the embassy or immigration counselor who is doing to the processing.

WE can call it HOPE and pretend that the messiah is the answer to all of our problems, while in reality he and his elected congress are the problem. We can believe that the New World Order will take away the American dream as we sell out to China, Russia and the Arabs!   We can only wonder WHY we needed a bail-out in the first place, where did the money go and why aren't all the people who lined their pockets with it -PROSECUTED! We can ponder this, "Why are the same people in charge of our economy and financial institutions today?"    WE can get on our KNEES and PRAY for America, it's leaders and people will see the error of our ways, and stop the mass genocide of unborn babies, and of worshiping the golden calf~We can pray for our furture generations, and for the peace of Jerusalem....
SRF2FiWPaa	-- I might be able to help - all important pivotal battles   Midway-- the Americans had a base at midway island in the south pacific-- after their success at pearl harbour apparently the Japanese felt they only had enough fuel to fight for eight months and so they wanted a fast victory to defeat America before American could mobilize and start war production ( because the Japanese were afraid of american war production and ingenuity )   -- so the Japanese attacked Midway and the Aleutian Islands trying to ambush and destroy the American fleet-- but partly because of American code breakers and American pilots, many of whom sacrificed their lives, well the Japanese in turn were ambushed  ====== battle of Midway resulted in the Japanese loss of four AirCraft Carriers  ======================================...  El Alamein  Up to this point Rommel the desert fox was undefeated and had defeated every British General up to that point. At El Alamein, close to Cairo the British launched a successful counter attack. Allied forces special trained to it. narrow front tonnes and tonnes of artillery, short britich supply lines , long German supply lines, close Allied fighter and allied bomber support. lots of allied soldiers and reserves. meant allied victory  ======El Alamein - first major British ( allied victory ) against what appeared to be an unstoppeable and invincible enemy-- ( only a battle victory total german defeat in North Africa would come later with American help.   ========  Stalingrad--- Hitler ordered the capture of Stalingrad in Russia, and the Russians cleverly stopped him. The Russians fought tooth and nail for months in the city.   === secretly -- historians are amazed because they thought some kind of German airplane reconnaince should have seen something. But some how some way the Russians brought up lots of reserves and later used these to attack on both sides of Stalingrad, and join up and surround the Germans who were still inside Stalingrad. The German sixth army was forced to surrender at Stalingrad. And the first German field marshal was captured.   === Stalingrad-- major Russian victory and major German defeat on the Russian front.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	All three battles.  Good guys won, bad guys lost.

Battle of Stalingrad - Soviet Army defeated the German Army, stopping them from further advances into the Soviet Union.|`|YnfOf3YKaa	Battle of Midway is the turning point in the pacific just basics  El Alamein drove the germans out of Africa  Stalingrad turning point in Eastern Europe basically defeat of the Germans|`|UoAZLRG8aa	World War II For Dummies  $20.00 + s&h|`|AA11995584	Midway, was the first decisive Victory of US Forces over Japan and forced Japan to uses it's Navy in a defensive posture rather than offensive posture. It is also the first navel engagement where air power was the only tool used in combat, and neither armada of ships ever saw each other.    El Alamein was the first major defeat of Rommules Panzers and forced Germany out of the Oil Fields of North Africa.    Stalingrad was major defense of a siege Russian City that forced German retreat from east Europe. If Stalingrad would have fallen, Russia would probably have surrendered to Germany thus allowing the Germans to consolidated forces in the west.

PZaGrNVZaa	"Censorship is a term pertaining only to governmental action. No private action is censorship. No private individual or agency can silence a man or suppress a publication; only the government can do so. The freedom of speech of private individuals includes the right not to agree, not to listen, and not to finance one's own antagonists."    Remember that freedom of speech actually means; the right to say whatever you want - as long as it is true! But it does not guarantee you the means to say it; if nobody wants to publish or broadcast your views that is their right and is not censorship. A law making them propagate your views because you are black, gay, religious, etc, is an act of censorship.|`|RfTyTA5oaa	Perhaps this will help.    It's easy to get people to support the censorship of unpopular views, such as the ignorance spouted by the KKK and white supremacists.    However once they've been silenced, who is next?  Look at the laws in China; how people are jailed for speaking out against the government.    Now imagine we had the same laws here.  How many people would go to jail simply for opposing the war?  Is that the kind of America we want to live in?|`|ejC5wVG2aa	Some reasons:    - everyone has a right to speak their mind  - if you everyone can speak, the best ideas will win  - if you censor, people won't be aware of bad or evil ideas|`|rAcQW9afaa	Why is censorship wrong?  That can be answered, I think, by asking another question, "Who is doing the censoring?"      How does that person/authority/government make the decision whether to censor something, and should that power be given to just that one entity?  Isn't the decision about whether the content of a newspaper, magazine, book, or movie is "appropriate" best be left to the public?
h7ygMBP8aa	excessive isolation is indeed a cruel and quite rare punishment which i d like to think only becomes available as  a form of penalty in extreme criminal cases.  Isolation is a mental torture that goes against the human nature and if practised for a long period of time can be the cause of serious mental disorders or even physical. A lot of people nowadays believe that such a punishment is actually much more cruel than capital punishment.  Your last question of "when does it become so" is already answered in the start of your question by the use of the word excessive!|`|AA10245589	THE MINUTE IT BECOMES SO IN YOUR MIND|`|135ea6e86799240fbf32bf034df9c50faa	Are you referring to isolation as in Isolation from communicable disease? or Isolating criminals in prisons? I'll be back and check on this question.|`|cilYUWgtaa	Cruel maybe.. unusual? Not so much. The law says that cruel and unusual punishment is unlawful. It says nothing about punishment that is only cruel OR unusual.|`|u0IodZtYaa	It depends...first only the government can commit cruel and unusuall punishment.    The only time I can think of this happening is in prison...and since it takes more resources to separate individuals from the greater population they usually have a good reason to do so...either the inmate is attacking others or  is in danger of  an attack....did you have other examples in mind?|`|AA11209680	Yes. It may not be defined as such in law books, but if you really want to torture a human being, prevent them from communicating or being communicated too, and see how long he/she remains sane.

Also remind her as much as she feels for you and - that's great, good on her - she is young she has tons of life in front of here and far better people then you to find. She will find some one that fits her far better then you do.    Hopefully this helps, Remember be professional and not childish about this. I would also recommend being forceful to anyone whom starts teasing or name calling.|`|AA11999780	no this is not stalking... get over yourself
5Qo6OWNzaa	I've seen tickets dismissed for less so give it a shot. |`|Gezfmghuaa	You MIGHT be able to fight this one, but here's the rub.  The violation number itself refers to a specific speed range (i.e. lets say 10-15 above the limit).  Where your actual speed falls in that range is irrelevant.  So even though there is no actual speed, he did note the range.    That said, its certainly something you can mention in your plea conference with the prosecutor, might get them to be a little more generous to avoid any contention in court.  |`|DWODMHcQaa	Just pay your ticket and try harder not to get caught next time. :)|`|AA12118274	You can give it a try. BUT the cop probably wrote the speed in his report and just did not put it on your ticket. If that is the case they will just re-issue the ticket and re-schedule you for court, giving you time to review the ticket.     However maybe they are to busy to deal with it and will just let you off. What do you have to loose. |`|Xztm7mh7aa	Saying sorry, and asking to be let off with a warning are both indirect admissions of guilt, Bub.......you're going to take your lumps and slow down in future, if you "Poke the Bear" as it were by citing minor omissions on your citation, you may get more than you wanted for a response from the Judge.....get it over with.  
AA12118274	I think Jefferson would be disapointed with both parties. |`|MEReSvZeaa	Republican.    The center, center left, and left would be completely alien to him.  He lived at a time when religion and tradition were extremely important parts of culture.  He might have hacked off the head of anyone who would dare question Christianity or a Christian.    As for seperation of church and state, it was the church that kept vital records and held important political meetings and interest groups.  That concept might be alien to him as well.  Remove the 10 commandments from a courtroom?  He would show up with pistols to defend the court room.|`|2jNQhT7laa	Almost certainly none of them.|`|AA11288277	Jefferson would be a Republican.  The Republican party as we know it today rose from the ashes of the Democrat-Republican party of Jefferson.  This party died out when Andrew Jackson became president and the Jacksonian Democrats took over.  The party reformed as the Republican Party when Abraham Lincoln was running for office. |`|Ippd6MuPaa	Jefferson was opposed to parties and would be running as an independent    "Men by their constitutions are naturally divided into two parties: 1. Those who fear and distrust the people, and wish to draw all powers from them into the hands of the higher classes. 2. Those who identify themselves with the people, have confidence in them, cherish and consider them as the most honest and safe, although not the most wise depositary of the public interests. In every country these two parties exist, and in every one where they are free to think, speak, and write, they will declare themselves. Call them, therefore, Liberals and Serviles, Jacobins and Ultras, Whigs and Tories, Republicans and Federalists, Aristocrats and Democrats, or by whatever name you please, they are the same parties still and pursue the same object. The last one of Aristocrats and Democrats is the true one expressing the essence of all." --Thomas Jefferson to Henry Lee, 1824. ME 16:73|`|oqAPBwXNaa	I agree with the sentiment that the Republican and Democrat parties of today would be foreign to Thomas Jefferson.  Although it is pretty sad, I don't think there would be a place for Jefferson in today's politics.

You can agree or disagree with Jefferson and/or his concepts of individual liberty but anyone familiar with his writings knows that this is not a difficult question to answer.|`|CWOF23MVaa	From what he's said, neither. He would mount a rebellion and be considered a terrorist as he tried to pull the system apart with any means at his disposal, be it weapons or whatever. He'd be so pissed off, he'd be put in prison faster than protester in history.|`|SnkaH7W6aa	I think he would become independent--the republican party was different when Jefferson was alive---and the democrats are not his thing--so he probably would go independent....|`|b3yGRefVaa	 libertarian, but only if the definitian of a "citizen" was the same as it was in 1801.

When is the last time you saw that woman anywhere?|`|oMOiAFRBaa	Your question should read "why did she say it TWICE." That's right, she repeated this comment at two different rallies, proving that it wasn't a slip of the tongue, but that she meant what she said.  She still has made no effort to publicly retract or explain this comment - not that it would help much.  I think the American people can put two and two together.  Barack Obama's wife hates America, his pastor hates America, his buddy Bill Ayers hates America, and his  1 financial backer MoveOn.org hates America.  So do most of his endorsers, from Michael Moore to Jane Fonda.  There is a narrative building here that no one can deny.

I had the "Ion-retexturizing" or "Japanese straightening" and you are right, it can look good when you leave the salon, but you won't know for sure until you wash your hair (3 days later, at least).   Well, the first time it didn't even look good right after she was done, and it just got worse after I washed it.   She ask me to come back so she could fix it. This time she had her sister help her, and it looked great when I left. Four days later I washed and realized that most of it was still wavy.  I called her and she asked me to stop by so she could take a look, I did and then never heard form her for 10 days. I finally decided not to do business with them anymore, god knows how many more times it will take for them to fix it...So I asked for my money back (they charge top dollar for this, $800) and she said there's no way I would get my money back because I accepted the price during our consultation.  So here i go to small claim court.  Good luck to me and you, let me know what you decide and the outcome of it :)|`|L6kIV3Liaa	Did you get a bad color or cut?   If it turned out ok and worked for 3 days is it bad now because YOU can't get it to style correctly? Can you give us a little more   Whenever you have such harsh chemicals put in your hair YOU should ask for it to be tested first. I'm sorry I know that doesn't help now.   In stead of being on the defense try going back to the salon and see what they can do to help. Your hair might just need a deep conditioning. They could probably give you some good tips on how to dry it to give it good lift and volume. Some styling products would probably help too.     After 3 days I doubt you would get anywhere in court with this or get any kind of refund. Sorry, I know it sucks.|`|4b9a85a6035089657723b2a7f272c834aa	It's not worth suing over $300.

I presume you live in USA, because over here in the U.K we have somewhere to discuss these sort of problems before we take further action, it is Citizens Advice... Hope this helps and Good Luck....|`|AA11481224	no you cant  you left the salon satisfied  to sue you have to have proof of damages done at the time  there are none    it took three days for you to be unhappy they can turn it around and say you did something to it to get your hair done for free and they would win

Probably, but we can't bank on that fact. The average life span for white males is in the 70's. If he were to pass in office, we would be stuck with Palin. If he were to be assassinated, we would be stuck with Palin. How can you not factor that in?|`|AA10903893	Let's See:    Obama can site Supreme Court cases outside Roe v. Wade.    Obama can actually list a newspaper he reads.    He knows what Constitutional Mandate of the office he is running for entails.    He knows it is illegal to conduct State business out of a Yahoo e-mail account to circumvent mandatory retention policies    She can't answer a single question that hasn't been scripted for her.    She charges the State of Alaska a per diem, and works from home, so she spent LESS than 143 days in the office of the Govornor.

On the economy, where you are struggling, his plan will help you out. It's better then McCain's plan says advanced economists.  Health care, he will let you keep your previous insurance and decrease it, while helping those who really need health care and don't have it.  On the environment, he wants to invest a lot of money on alternative energy sources so in the long run we won't be dependent on oil.  Off the top of my head I can't go into to much detail, but many INTELLIGENT university GRADUATES that specialize in the environment, economy and other things say that Obama's plan is better then McCains.  That's the change. A change from Bush policies.     Edit: Ok they don't apply to you, but why would you vote McCain? Either way none of his policies will affect you either. But you are voting for your country. TO make your country a better place, if you love America, you vote to fix its problems.

People need to read if they think that everything is equal all of a sudden. That slave trade was huge in the developement of our history. White had the advantage by 400 years of free labor and untaxed wealth accumulated since then. How many people got rich and owned land during that period. And still have ties to that money today.ALOT..Now i read about slaves being sold how does a slave trade a slave. they cant they both are slaves. Things will never be equal until Whites understand they are benefitting from this in ways they dont see. The stocks the land all wealth in America stems from this|`|aCadUAEUaa	In a nation that was founded on genocide and then built on the backs of slaves, it was an unexpected moment, shocking in its simplicity: Barack Obama, a good man, a black man, said he would bring change to Washington, and the majority of the country liked that idea. The racists were present throughout the campaign and in the voting booth. But they are no longer the majority, and we will see their flame of hate fizzle out in our lifetime.|`|sKXzYvaRaa	"Especially given that Africans were brought here to be enslaved "    Uhhh... they were enslaved before they got here.      For it to be "justice" would mean that it needs to be a punishment for the United States which means you must think that Obama is going to be a horrible president (if he is a good one it is hardly a punishment).  Why do you feel this way?|`|RXwuljUaaa	If you think this election is about race you are a fool. A President cannot have race, they need to be an American and take care of all Americans, not matter how they look or who they pray too. This claim that he is African-American is very disappointing.|`|Wlt9Ypjkaa	If we look at our ancestors, all of them were treated unjustly. Hell, some of mine were slaves in Egypt. We can't repay those debts, because they aren't alive and we didn't contribute to their suffering. What we should be worrying about is providing equality and a good future to the people alive today. By electing Barack Obama, we demonstrated that those of us here now have gone a good part of the way to doing just that. Not all of the way, that won't happen until racism is completely gone, but part of it.|`|AA12195052	I don't think very many people look at it that way at all. Most of us rejoice that to a large degree our country is getting less racist. It is a bright day for America that an African American can be elected President. I look forward to the day when we as a nation do not even notice skin color, just ideas. Just so you know, I did not vote for Obama, but I do celebrate his success.|`|N0iM1mo8aa	Justice for what? an insane practice that was rectified a century and a half ago.  What a stupid question.

It has nothing to do with race.  There is no justice because a black man one.  If we elected an intelligent one them maybe.  Slavery ended a long time ago.  Who wants muslim traditions here anyway.  Besides, how many of the slaves were muslim?  Oh yeah, they were traded by their own people.  It wasn't whites trading to whites, it was blacks to white.  No I don't support slavery in anyway, but now we will all be slaves to his socialist agenda.  |`|g2yUDLygaa	If you define "justice" as serving your selfish, racist agenda, then yes.

Everyone, mostly white people with racial issues. are asking the same question, however, I think is time to move on and think of our president elect as a man capable of leading this country out of the mess some righteous white people sunk it in. I don't think of him as a black man, I think of him as the political figure who brought me to tears with his inspiring speeches, integrity and a phenomenal campaign   |`|Rq3FOK2Taa	That's a racist statement.   Being a president has nothing to do with race, it has to do with running a country.  You just proved why you and everyone else voted for him.  America used to be about freedom.  Now that Obama's gonna be President, it's gonna be a racist contry again.   On the news, it said that there were threats that if Obama doesn't win, there will be riots all over the country.  There were groups threatening people with nightsticks if they voted for McCain.  There's gonna be 4 years of this with Obama as president.  |`|AA12334663	Justice doesn't have anything to do with an African American being elected president.Political change and human nature does.     The sad thing is that this euphoria won't last long and our president will be Joe Biden. I do not know if this will happen, but I am afraid it will. Down south somewhere is a redneck who is not going to want an "n" as his president and that somewhere and sometime there will be a bullet waiting for Obama.

I think this is an historical moment for America, but at this point-- not even a full 24 hours after he was elected-- any semblance of "justice" has only been symbolic.  The singular thing he has truly accomplished as of this point is mobilizing America-- and that is something huge, but I don't think justice is simply served by Obama making it to the White House.  This is truly about what he's going to do, not whether or not he's black-- because that may be true, but that doesn't say anything about what kind of president he will be.  We just have to wait and see.  I, for one, am excited to see just how he will take us in a new direction.    It does irk me that people feel the need to forget that he is half white.  Not because I feel I need to hold onto his race as much as possible.  But because being biracial myself (and appearing to be entirely white-- and especially now, since my father is Iraqi), I understand what it's like to be treated like you are wholly one thing when you have another part of you that is also very important to who you are-- a part of your family and your experience that should not be overlooked just because you're not able to suggest it with your skin.  And I can't help but chuckle knowing that the fact that he is biracial will be one of those little tidbits that is taught in history classes years from now.  "Americans went crazy about finally having their first black president... but his mother was white."  But I understand that there's a desire for and a definite importance to this symbolism (regardless of whether he is biracial).    I wouldn't call what has happened "justice", but I think the prospects for minorities are great at this point.  I feel as though people can't just see what has been as *enforced* as "status quo" & normative anymore-- when they see our *president*, for God's sake.  Maybe they'll think more about how many people are out there.  Maybe this is an opportunity for some of them to be in as much upheaval as some of us we have been.  I'm definitely painting with too broad of brush here, and I apologize for that.  But it's crazy.  The prospects are truly awesome, but especially because I expect that race (& other topics that have been tucked away from public life by nearly everyone) are going to be something that can be talked about more openly now.  Right now, people are expressing how *they* feel.  And for a lot of people, that means expressing anger that our president-elect is named Barack Hussein Obama & that he "is" a Muslim (although he is not).  For many other people, that means feeling empowered and joyful.  But I think we definitely need to remember that he is not yet the leader of America.  And he may be our first black president, but he may also just be a horrible president and a great (great, great) orator.  This is a historical moment, but let us remember that we *must* judge him by the true content of his character, and not by the color of his skin.  For therein lies the true value of this moment.|`|v71wb9MBaa	no..i don't think a president should be elected bc of his race...which was the case in this election...now blacks will think they run the world and the country will be more segregated than ever|`|faAlDRWBaa	How much longer are you going to play the race card?

First of all Africans were not Muslims, some may be now, but they weren't during the time of slavery.    Obama is not descended from slaves, he is an African American, not a black person (this is the politically correct term).    Slavery was ended in this country 150 years ago and we've made slow and steady progress at eliminating institutionalized racism.    While it's cool and all to elect a black president, it's not proof of much.  Barrack Obama's black skin doesn't give him any special powers or abilities or anything, it's just a "thing".|`|rUgC7SPsaa	I don't think it's JUSTICE.  I am just proud of our nation for taking that tiny step and voting him into office even though his skin color happens to have deeper pigment.  I can see some irony in the fact that he is a dark-skinned person and our President Elect.  Other dark-skinned people were used as slaves in our country's tainted past, but I don't think that voting him into office makes up for the fact that this country was built by slave labor.  How can you give justice to that?|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Has justice been served are you serious. Yeah many people dont realize that blacks were sold by their own people yeah "SOLD" so. I hope that there arnt a lot of people like you out there that voted just because he's black, and they think it would be "justice served" if he became president. I think he could make some good changes, but not because hes black just because anyone is better than bush.    And I hope maybe someone can educate you a little bit more slavery has been over for over 100 years. Are you even old enough to vote and if you are did you vote for him for the right reasons?? Or because hes black?|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	You might want to ask their own original tribes that sold them off as slaves first. |`|qYZ2QFlbaa	Sure.

Just another hate filled post from a sore winner.|`|2oSlvvdNaa	No, since he is not a part of those who are descended from slaves, nor did he lose his language, and the Muslim traditions you mention were imposed on the slaves by the Muslim slavers, and were not a part of the slaves original religious beliefs.    As a matter of fact, Obama is descended from a family which made their money capturing slaves in Africa and selling them overseas.|`|EjD36wj9aa	That is just silly. first you need to consider learning some history. African slaves did not have a muslim culture. They had their own religion and culture.    Justice has nothing to do with the election. Elections are not about justice. Elections are about who got the most votes, that derives from who has the most money, and who has the most support from the media. Justice was not served. Big money was.    We are not better for it., and I speak about the process not the result.    And by the way you are acting like a racist for the way you ask the question. Think about that for a change and see how it feels.

6Fsliwlhaa	Make that blunt your last and wait about 30 days.  Even then, the recruiter will ask you if you ever used illegal drugs.  You will be tested at MEPS before the actual physical, possibly again before you go to basic, and randomly throughout your career.  If you are not sure you can ask the recruiter to give you a urinalysis prior to you going to MEPS.  If you fail at the recruiter station it can stay in-house but if you fail at the MEPS you have to wait 45 days for a retest if it is marijuana and you need a waiver from the lieutenant colonel in charge of the recruiting stations in your area.  If you can't bring yourself to quit now then you might find yourself getting kicked out with a discharge you DON'T want after you get in.|`|jXs6CtWNaa	i just went to the navy recruiter today and in the recruiters office he did a pre screen test, i stopped smoking probably like 3 weeks to a month ago and i actually passed to my surprise, the recruiter said it usually takes 30-45 days to get out of the urine with regards to how strong the marijuana is and the quality, dont go to MEPS! and get your first test because if you do test positive you will screw yourself over and they will not let you in and it will be a big problem, MEPS btw if you didnt know is the medical examination they perform on you after the test and stuff, if you really wanna be certain buy a test at CVS and test yourself prior to going, good luck future soldier|`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	I just want you to add to the first answer, do lie about drug use. Otherwise you will have to get a waiver and that isn't guaranteed. If you don't have any record proving you smoked weed, it is very unlikely that they will ever find out. And this is true even if you get a secret clearance.     You might get in trouble if you go for a top secret clearance, maybe, but otherwise you are in the clear. Just make sure you have a month window until your MEPS, and you should be fine. You will take a physical then.|`|480393beb0bd8d738e3d33a34301d4faaa	After you contact a recruiter, he will not make you go to MEPS (where they test you) until you are ready. But honestly, sometimes drugs stay in your system 6 months afterwards, depending on how much and when, but this usually doesn't apply to marijuana. I would say to not smoke for 2-3 weeks then try, but there is no 100% guarentee.     I would also suggest you let your recruiter know so he/she can help you, I promise they will do anything to let you in, because they have a monthly quota to reach for recruits. Never lie though, lying can get you in deep trouble.    But, if you want to join the military, I would highly suggest that you get clean and stay clean. You will be tested many times throughout your career at random. You may get a dishonorable if it is found in your system after you join, which is a felony.
WyCmQBuvaa	I disagree with Pebbles here.  If you followed all the procedures in your employee manual, how can you be accused of fraud?

But i promise if you try to take a notarized copy of your passport to go to another country you will be turned away.  You see there are special colors, or watermarks on government issues documents, that help to prove they are not fakes.  Copies, even notarized, are not going to have those marks.|`|AA11705476	In CA, the only document a notary can certify is a power of attorney. When a copy is made of a document, such as a passport, the notary is actually notarizing the client's statement that the document is a true copy of the original.    Here's an example of a copy certification http://www.freewebs.com/docdiva/CA%20Cop...    A copy never takes the place of the original so they probably just wanted the notarized copy for processing.|`|56jJd8RJaa	It's DEFINETLY NOT a original passport document in any state under any state notary laws. All any notary in state can do is verify you are who you say you are and the document you sign is just that. Nothing more.    www.mobileaustinnotary.com  "The Nicest Notaries in Texas, That Go To You 24/7!"

The actual length of time it will take before a visa is issued depends on who filed the petition (US citizen or Green Card holder), what family member is being petitioned (spouse, parent, child under 21, child over 21, etc...) and the country the person being petitioned in lives in.    For instance.  a brother, US Citizen, petitioning his brother or sister in the Philippines has a 23 year wait for a visa.

Your duties will vary from running paper work, to crash scene traffic control and investigation. Get in good physical shape, go the library and check out he Police Officers test book this is helpful.

1KGXts5Daa	CALIFORNIA WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE (WIC)  SECTION 5170, 5174:    5170. When any person is a danger to others, or to himself, or   gravely disabled as a result of inebriation, a peace officer, member of the attending staff, as defined by regulation, of an evaluation facility designated by the county, or other person designated by the county may, upon reasonable cause, take, or cause to be taken, the person into civil protective custody and place him in a facility designated by the county and approved by the State Department of Alcohol and Drug Abuse as a facility for 72-hour treatment and evaluation of inebriates.     5174. It is the intent of the Legislature (a) that facilities for 72-hour treatment and evaluation of inebriates be subject to state funding under Part 2 (commencing with Section 5600) of this division only if they provide screening, evaluation and referral services and have available medical services in the facility or by referral agreement with an appropriate medical facility, and would normally be considered an integral part of a community health program;  (b) that state reimbursement under Part 2 (commencing with Section 5600) for such 72-hour facilities and intensive treatment facilities,  under this article  shall not be included as priority funding  ... for involuntary treatment services,   but may be provided on the basis of new and expanded services if funds for new and expanded services are available; that while facilities receiving funds from other sources may, if eligible for funding under this division, be designated as 72-hour facilities, or intensive treatment facilities for the purposes of this article, funding of such facilities under this division shall not be substituted for such previous funding.|`|AA12020119	Well, ours is 10 days if the person is found to be a danger to themselves or others by a court.

You sound like a real winner.|`|D8SpQAgLaa	fraud, if they do anything.|`|rVhrVyRGaa	It could be internet fraud and/or theft (basically, you "stole" money from the prospective buyer), I would think. An example, as listed on wikipedia is this: Auction and retail schemes online     "Fraudsters launch auctions on eBay or TradeMe with very low prices and no reservations especially for high priced items like watches, computers or high value collectibles. They received payment but never deliver, or deliver an item that is less valuable than the one offered, such as counterfeit, refurbished or used. Some fraudsters also create complete webstores that appear to be legitimate, but they never deliver the goods.    Sometimes fraudsters will combine phishing to hijacking legitimate member accounts on eBay, typically with very high numbers of positive feedback, and then set up a phony online store. They received payment usually via check, money-order, cash or wire transfer but never deliver the goods; then they leave the poor, unknowing eBay member to sort out the mess. In this case the fraudster collects the money while ruining the reputation of the conned eBay member and leaving a large number of people without the goods they thought they purchased."     http://www.fbi.gov/majcases/fraud/intern...    Internet auction fraud was by far the most reported offense, comprising 44.9% of referred complaints. Non-delivered merchandise and/or payment accounted for 19.0% of complaints in 2007.      http://www.buggrit.com/ebay.html   "While many quite vocally complain about the horrible rash of deadbeat bidders on eBay, people who never pay for items they win, an even more prevalent problem on the site is BAD SELLERS. These dishonest sellers are barred from eBay"      http://www.auctionbytes.com/pages/abn/y0...     "Brian D. Wildman, age 31, of Miami, Florida, was sentenced to 5 months in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, followed by 5 months of home confinement with electronic monitoring, for his role in connection with an eBay Internet auction fraud scheme.    On September 19, 2001, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Brian D. Wildman with twelve counts of Wire Fraud and two counts of Mail Fraud. The indictment alleged that Brian Wildman advertised for sale on eBay certain rare, valuable and collectible baseball and basketball card sets, and that after the successful bidders sent payment to Wildman, either via the U.S. Mail or via Paypal (an Internet payment service), Wildman failed to ship the items as agreed"    Another story: "A father and son were arrested and charged with wire fraud for allegedly selling PlaySation 2 game units on online auction sites and not providing buyers with the units, which they did not own."     Another item: "Richard Wesley Morris of Arcata, California pleaded guilty in federal court in San Francisco to charges of bilking online bidders who never received the items he had offered for sale on EBay. According to prosecutors, Morris had been posted items on EBay but did not ship them to winning bidders. Authorities believe that over 50 people in the U.S. and other countries were defrauded by Morris, with losses of at least $10,000. Morris allegedly used numerous EBay IDs and e-mail addresses. Using different user names, Morris built his feedback up by selling items back and forth to himself, according to an FBI affidavit. Morris plead guilty to one count each of wire fraud and mail fraud. He could face prison when sentenced on Sept. 12. "     (So, what do you think?? Is it worth facing jail time??Also, if you do it too many times you can be barred from buying or selling on ebay. )|`|LxfjzzM2aa	i hope your not thinking about doing that.  if so, your trash!
AA11494150	The requirement is "probable cause"    That is defined as information leading a person of average intelligence to believe the search would probably turn up something illegal.     Information from a single person is normally not enough without other evidence. However, if that person has given you information in the past, and you found it reliable , it could be enough.|`|AA10206116	An extensive investigation would take place before any search warrant is served to a private residence. If the police get several complaints, they'll take the case more seriously, and if they find conclusive evidence that illegal activity is going on, the police are able to get a search warrant that day if they feel it is necessary.|`|D8SpQAgLaa	It's in the constitution: "Probable cause" not "proof". As long as what you've observed is probable cause that something illegal is happening, they can get a warrant. Even one witness is probably telling the truth so there don't have to be multiple witnesses.
Cx8EKcemaa	Well I'm sure you know it is broken down into three phases.     First Phase-   You learn basic drill, customs, courtesies, rank structure, history, Martial Arts, etc. Basically a lot of knowledge packed into 4 weeks. And you will learn what the quarter deck is and of course "The Pit" be prepared to get smoked a lot.    Second Phase-    Is the rifle range, snap-in, and mostly field exercises.    Third Phase-   You refine your drill, rifle manual, and prepare for the crucible. I can't remember if you do repelling during second or third phase, you can find a schedule on-line.     The Crucible-   This was by far the hardest thing for me. Over the course of 72 hours you do two 12 mile (I think) humps, this doesn't include all the other running/walking you do. I read somewhere each company averages 50-60 miles during the crucible. It is filled with tons of exercises, hard as **** but tons of fun.     And throughout all this you are also having inspections, learning first aid, preparing uniforms, PT, O-courses, Confidence course, and learning everything there possibly is to know about the Marines.     Graduation/EGA Ceremony-  Just know that graduation will be the best day of your life. Or it was for me.    Boot Camp is hard, but it is worth it. You will come out a completely new person. All you can do is keep moving forward and keep the motivation up. There was a documentary made about it called "Ears, Open, Eyes, Click" it gives you an idea of what boot camp is like, just times by like 100 and that is what boot camp is really like. Remember in your platoon though, there won't be any cameras.     Good luck and Semper Fi!    Edit: To the ranger guy. Why do you compare our BASIC training to the Rangers? Rangers go through Ranger school to become...Rangers. Every Marine goes through our boot camp to become everything from Admin to EOD. So if you are comparing one of the hardest schools in the Army to Basic Training in the Marines, I guess we must have a pretty bad *** boot camp.|`|dSbAz63baa	marines boot camp is a joke. Excuse me, no offense, not mentally, Excuse that entire last line but im trying to put it a nice way : ) marines run 3 miles to complete boot camp. Rangers run 12 miles, take a 30 second water break, pack on 60lbs and hump 10 more miles *daily*    Edit:) marines are sore losers. Thumbs down indicates everything. I can piss 3 miles dude. And whats sad, im sure many marines could as we'll - before even entering usmc.|`|vKxt1i0Faa	When did boot camp become so damn hard. Be fit and determined and it is NOT that hard.|`|npMVWV7raa	There is surprisingly a lot of classes you would attend throughout boot camp. Some will be long and my advice is don't even look like you're falling asleep... or else. Physical training for the most part wasn't too bad either. The Crucible to me wasn't too bad. During that period, you'll be learning basic combat skills and doing teamwork orientated stuff (ie: obsticle courses, causalty evac, etc.) which wasn't the worst part physically speaking. If one guy is falling behind or is having trouble, we help him out immediately to get the job done. For me the worst part was the 12 mile hike and the lack of sleep which is 4 hrs at most assuming you don't have fire watch.|`|JDxpjT34aa	First phase you have a lot of classes and it can be very hard to stay awake through them, but believe me you don't want to fall asleep! If you're physically prepared for the PT it won't be so bad but if you're not conditioning yourself  you may have a hard time. You do a lot of drill and a lot of mcmap. Second phase is the rifle range where you spend the first part of it learning how to shoot and snapping in before you actually shoot at the range. Not only do you shoot but you pull pits too (which sucks). Third phase is when you do all the fun stuff like A-line and the crucible. The crucible is a great experience, you'll see how much the platoon has grown in knowledge, leadership, and teamwork when you do the crucible.|`|jumISG9laa	its tough butif ur determined u can do it  http://www.marinebootcamp.net/
dLw9RAovaa	when i saw my husband when he graduated USAF BMT it was so wonderful. saying good bye the second time was very hard but easier. ( if that makes any sense lol) he was in tech school for 3 months but it was muuch easier than when he was in boot camp because he had his cell phone and we talked EVERY NIGHT!!! i was so glad that there where NO MORE LETTERS!!! so if he has a cell phone bring it, or if he brought it with him he will get it probably that saturday. tech school is just like a "job". he will get off at 5pm and have the rest of the day to himself and weekends off. 8 weeks is long but it will be alot easier in tech school. good luck and dont worry!|`|CXjuuUViaa	Honestly, you can't make it less painful.  My fiance is in the Army and I went to his basic training, it was awesome to see him and i knew he was coming home for Christmas two weeks later, and it was still hard. After he spent two weeks home for Christmas, it was even harder to say goodbye. He left Jan 2nd and he graduates AIT March 6, about the same time your husband will be away. It's still hard. I know you say only 8 weeks and I said it too but it's still very hard. My fiance gets to have his phone that he can use after classes and on the weekends. It should probably be about the same.   If there is any way to make it less painful, I would say try to stay positive, talk and think about the things you will be able to do together when he finally gets home rather than the things that you can't do now because he is gone. Just really enjoy the time you get to spend with him. He really needs your optimism, it is much harder being one the other side of the fence. I'm in the Army too and when you are the one who is away, it gets worse tenfold. When you are in training you are not only away from your significant other, you are away from everyone and everything you know, in a completely alien environment.   So, my advice would be to stay as positive as you can, good luck!

If you want the Army Story presented to you talk to a recruiter and they can tell you about bonuses, college money both during and after service (the $4,500 worth of tuition assistance a year is free and doesn't come out of the GI Bill), and adventure.  Most people who say the military is bad either never been in the military and go by rumors or they were in but got kicked out because they couldn't behave.|`|iHpknoLwaa	Contrary to what your cousin thinks, the government/military is not trying to "take over you."  Will you be a different person in some ways 4 years from now if you join the military?  Most likely.  Will you be a different person 4 years from now if you don't join the military?  Once again, most likely.  It's called maturing, and either way it's going to happen.    Joining the military can be a very rewarding opportunity, now more-so than ever .  You have a chance to truly say that you helped make history.  The benefits can barely be beat by other civilian rivals.    However, if you go into it with the attitude that you aren't going to let "the man" break you, then you're going to have a miserable time.  You need to learn that you will be following orders, and you will start out on the bottom of the totem pole.  If you have a problem with that and go into it with a chip on your shoulder, then save everyone the trouble and don't join.  But if you go into it with the right frame of mind, then you can make the most out of your 4-20 years of proud military service.|`|YnfOf3YKaa	You dont join the military so you can see if they can break you military purpose is to train so you want to be broken unless your a natural but your instincts will get in the way so of course you will change for the good, and yes your mother is right about the benefits|`|CXjuuUViaa	Well, I'm in the Army, and I love it. I think it is a great career choice and there are definitely a lot of benefits. As for the "taking over" thing, I agree and disagree, I agree in the sense that the Army does change you, for the better, mostly. It teaches you to live a fit lifestyle and instills values like honor and loyalty and that kind of thing. Plus it gives you great skills for life after the Army. Employers will see you've been in the Army and probably automatically think that you are prompt, dependable, and a hard worker. I disagree with that because the Army does not "brain wash" you. You KNOW when you join the kind of values you have to live up to and you know what is expected of you. If that's not the life you want then DON'T JOIN.   That's just my take :)

Don't be surprised if it keeps you from joining the Air Force, since they have plenty of applicants.  It won't be as big a problem for the Army though.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	Moral Standards   The United States Military Services make every attempt to assess the moral quality of potential recruits, and several categories of moral offenses may preclude enlistment. This is primarily accomplished based on criminal record.   I should note here that there is no such thing as a "sealed record," or an "expunged record" as far as the military is concerned. The recruiting services have access to law enforcement and FBI investigative records, which -- quite often will list arrests in these categories.     Air Force. The Air Force divides criminal offenses into five categories. Category 1 offenses are considered the most serious (felonies), and category 5 offenses are the most minor. Applicants with one or more convictions or adverse adjudications from category 1, 2, or 3 offenses require a waiver. Those with two or more convictions or adverse adjudications in the past three years, or three or more convictions or adverse adjudications in a lifetime for a category 4 offense also require a waiver. Air Force applicants with six or more convictions or adverse adjudications in any 356 day period within the past three years from a category 5 offense also require a waiver. For complete information, see our Air Force Criminal History Information Pages.

President Franklin D Roosevelt was president during the Great Depression. But it was at the end of it, just as the worst passed. Economy was recovering itself. So FDR didn't really help that much. But people looked at it that way because they didn't know that the depression was over. FDR was inaugurated after everything started to recover. Obama just became president at the time we started having a recession. We should be having another depression. The problem is, it won't be Obama's fault next year when everything is bad. It will be the PEOPLES faults. The reason why we are in this state is because we are scared to invest in stocks, so the numbers lower. Then the idiotic banks, who invested OUR money into things like houses, cars, boats, etc... are losing it all since they also invested in stocks. That is why banks are going bankrupt. Like Obama said, people have to watch how banks spend their money. But we citizens must start spending money. All of us. We must start investing in stocks. Once we do that, we will not have a depression. But everyone is too scared to do that...|`|AA11031985	Um, can it be in the negative numbers?

Regulation inevitably gets it wrong, so let's just accept a series of smaller disasters and say that's the way it is.  Resistance is futile.

uh2bkRrFaa	I think most of the time when a cop is accused of killing a black man, it's justified, the black man was reaching for something and cops know very well doing something like this is going to get them a lot of heat and they're not just going to blindly shoot a black guy because they're "racist" knowing full well of the consequences.    But in this instance, I'm with you. There is no defense for the cops. The cop was arrested for murder one and the other cops on the scene should be arrested too. It's a very sad situation.|`|rUNlmQG5aa	The lawyers who win the case will make out big time as well as to a lesser extent the family of the victim. Apparently the deceased was not an Angel by any means and just perhaps the cop did in fact reach for the wrong weapon, but what would that matter when such an obvious video seems to encompass everything that need be explained by the mass perception? The funds are virtually waiting at their doorstep regardless of any exculpatory evidence. I'm less than in favor of excusing thugs merely when a hugely threatened police force makes a mistake.Certainly this individual should never have been allowed to become a cop. In short, **** happens, don't like it, don't commit a crime.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	If he's found guilty he's gonna get punished. Do i hear a big fat DUH?  What do you think? You people's problem is that whenever a cop does something bad you act like nothing bad happens to him, on the contrary, he gets screwed just like the other bad guys.   Cops defend their own from people like you who automatically assume that a cop murdered somebody in cold blood when he shot someone. Retards. You don't have a beef with firefighters do you? Didn't think so. Cops protect your life just as much as firefighters. Without them you can kiss your peaceful nights sleep goodbye.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	It's not my job to defend his actions, so I won't. But there weren't "2 cops on top of" Grant, nor was Mehserle fired. And it remains to be seen whether this was murder or something else. It may even be justifiable homicide, although that is not my reading of it.     Oh, and the Fruitvale BART station (I know it well as I use it regularly) is not "subway" but elevated.|`|1KGXts5Daa	there is no evidence to support a finding of "murder" - no matter what the D.A.'s office chooses to label it on their complaint - and no responsible, justice-seeking jury-of-12 would ever find reason to support a murder conviction against Mehserle, as this was not a premeditated (planned in advance) act, and there was no "malice aforethought" on his part.     DEFINITIONS OF MANSLAUGHTER AND MURDER:   manslaughter n. the unlawful killing of another person without premeditation  It is distinguished from murder by lack of any prior intention to kill someone, or to create a deadly situation.     murder n. the killing of a human being by a sane person, with intent - "malice aforethought" (prior intention to kill that particular victim), and with no legal authority.

Get your facts straight.|`|cYuGYhGmaa	He shot a subdued man in the back, and killed him.  His race should have nothing to do with it.|`|1XqmVsgwaa	Honestly, I don't know too much about the case. If the officer is found guilty of murder, he should be given a sentence on par with others that commit the same crime.    I don't know what you want officers to say. Sometimes officers screw up, it's tragic, especially when it results in someones death. As I said before, if it is apparent that the officer acted wrongly or illegally, there is no excuse for his actions.     Though, I am usually confused by the shear rage at police in general when something like this happens. Obviously if the officer is wrong, he should be punished.    Things aren't always what they seem to be though. The officer hasn't been convicted yet and all the facts probably aren't public. I think I heard officers contend that they thought the suspect was reaching for a weapon. And that is certainly justification for shooting. Police are not punching bags and I imagine if the suspect had not resisted arrest (or broken the law to gain police attention in the first place) this would not have happened.    I know I am placing blame on the victim here. But cops are murdered on the streets and if a suspect does anything to make an officer think that his life is in danger, expect the suspect to get some holes in them.    My final thought, a doctor in my area was recently convicted of murder. And I haven't heard one person damn all doctors or troll internet forums demanding other doctors attempt to defend one bad apple's actions and certainly there hasn't been any rioting over the situation.|`|86dbf689c9539acccd15feefb8b8f2a7aa	Ok, so what that this guy was a cop?  He did something wrong and he has begun to pay for it, and should get jail time to whatever the extent of the law dictates.  Good cops wouldnt defend that guys actions.  It was a little more than a simple mistake.      With all of that being said..keep in mind that if this guy were just some shulb off the street you probably wouldnt be asking this question.

PT7umXL0aa	Actually, i think that someone who cares about the groundwater is more inclined to love whales, or more likely to know who Rachel Carson is. I think good environmental poliy is intrinsically left-wing.    It think it all has to do with the ideas one has about individual empowerment or group dependence. Someone on the far right typically believes that everyone should be free to do what ever they want, and that the collective action of these individuals will make up a functioning society. If a shortage of say, whales, or groundwater arises, companies will arise to provide protection to whales or provide in clean water. Someone on the left believes that someones actions are determined by their surrounding group. The act to conform to group norms and they do not seek (only) to maximize profit.    The environment is a common good, and understanding they way we treat the environment as we do requires looking beyond the individual.   If you don't the problem is simply reframed as "shortages" or "markets to small to operate". If you think it is someones own choice to live next to a highway, or global warming an optimal market solution if everybody "chooses" to drive a F150, there is no environmental problem, and no task to the public.     Interestingly, the american right does have a sense of community, but is more of a "moral" community, against abortion and gay rights. The protection of the environment requires a sense of "material community", which stands perpendicular to the core of right wing ideals, such as unrestricted rights of ownership, and the enshrinement of private ownership (as opposed to public ownership). A lot of the environmental services are not market compatible, you cannot exclude people from their benefits. Take for instance biodiversity. How could a market be constructed so people who invest in biodiversity, be the only benefit from these investments. Those unwilling can keep their money, and visit the special rainforest, which they didn't save, by only paying an entrance fee.    Ofcourse you are right (no pun intended) when you say that it is just plain stupid to deplete our environmental resources beyond their carrying capacity. But i think it requires a fundamental reformulation of right-wing ideals.|`|bc1a10f4df223596a7823cf0ba6ac3e1aa	I am a fiscal and social conservative as well as a scientist that can read the evidence and see a problem with the environment. Fiscally, I believe in balanced budgets and paying down the national debt over tax breaks.  I do not support any of the social engineering schemes that liberals are prone to.  Liberals, please leave the work ethic and family alone.     The political problem works both ways.  There are some conservatives that label the environment as a liberal issue. It is not. In Canada Brian Mulroney, a Conservative did more to preserve the environment than his Liberal predecessors or successors.  Conservatives have a tradition of being on the right side of an issue.  True conservatives should recognize this rather than simply opposing anything a liberal supports.  Very occasionally liberals do get something right and the environment is one of those rare occasions.  Modern liberals smugly presume that anyone that cares for the environment is one of them. I, for one, am not.     I am interested in finding pragmatic solutions to environmental problems because I think that renewable energy must and will displace fossil fuels over the next three decades. My company's renewable energy is cost competitive with fossil fuels and profitable at today's prices. Fossil fuels will become more expensive to extract and the price will rise over the next three decades.  My company's costs per unit will remain static or decrease with automation and economies of scale, but the revenue will grow in line with fossil fuel prices.  The profit margin will increase and we will be able to invest in more renewable energy projects.  To a conservative, that is just good business.  If it also makes a liberal happy, so be it.|`|L5ayUwpcaa	I agree with Joe Romm. The massive environmental problem we're now facing (er, climate change) just can't be solved by the free market alone.    It needs government regulation, incentives, penalties, etc. in conjunction and isolation from the free market. This means three things that many conservatives inherently dislike and see as 'liberal'. First, it means big governments. Liberal governments are always bigger than conservative (privatizing) governments, secondly, it means governments with more control over our lives, and thirdly, it takes power away from the free market and gives it to that big government. Conservatives naturally see all this as sliding towards socialism.    As you know, we NEED those things (regulation, etc) if we're to have any hope of mitigating climate change. And the strongest weapon conservative commentators have (just ask Frank Luntz) is to make it as partisan, as liberal as possible, with the goal being to automatically capture the majority of conservatives out there in voter and consumer land. With the combination of (false) doubt over the science as well as making the issue partisan, it's no wonder we still have so many skeptics ot there.|`|KfCJDp0Laa	its directly down to business interests. 'cheap stuff' depends on externalizing environmental costs.    but now, there are obvious opportunities in 'cleaning the place up again', so the capitalists will be wanting to get in on the act (no offence d/dx, nothing wrong with that).    it is becoming less polarised in the u.k. at least; for the last 5 years our conservatives have had a very comprehensive environmental agenda, in some respects better than labour. our centre party the liberal democrats have had the best policies for many years.  but then, our 'conservatives' equate to about your 'independents', and our big business has become more used to constraint by pollution regulation. us being a more densely populated country and all, the health effects came to a head much earlier.|`|LnCIs86Caa	It's not that all environmentalists are necessarily liberal.  But quite often, those that are promoting protection and conservation are the ones screaming the loudest about the need for more government action.  The problem is, they see an issue and instead of convincing other people of the cause through discussion and example thereby changing THEIR minds and then they take up the cause, they insist that government will fix all the problems through more freedom restricting mandates and more taxes.  Sadly, this almost never solves anything because government has proved to be incompetent at solving almost every problem it has ever confronted.  So resulting from this, people have lost the freedom to decide how they want to live their lives, whether it be through buying a larger and safer SUV that may get lower gas mileage to something as seemingly insignificant as a mercury-free incandescent light bulb.  They have also lost the freedom to keep what they earn because more government is not only a loss of rights, but a loss of income because more government doesn't come cheap.    Government was never intended to mandate how people live.  It's intended purpose was to keep us free, not to babysit and command us to buy a certain light bulb.    Believing in taking care of the natural environment is a good thing and yes should all attempt to keep it clean and not destroy it.  However, taking away the rights and income of those that want nothing more than to live their lives the way they choose to live it is not only the apex of liberalism, it's just plain wrong.    Also, you're absolutely right on the money about Bush, Crist, and Schwarzenegger.  These guys are nothing but big government loving bureaucrats who have signed the same deal with the AGW devil that the entire Democratic party has bought into (which is a one of the main reason the Republican party has become an extention of the left.  But McCain, while he might be a good person, has also drank the Koolaid of man-made global warming among other issues.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Because most Republicans/Conservatives see issues in black and white terms.

Everything in our country turns into 'us vs. them', black and white, good or bad, Republicans vs. Democrats.    Some other examples - Democrats made 33% of the economic stimulus package tax cuts to appease Republicans, and got a grand total of zero votes from House Republicans.  155 out of 178 House Republicans voted against the benign bill to delay the transition to digital TV after the bill was passed unanimously in the Senate.   There's just this mindset or partisanship that if the opposing side supports something, it must be bad.    For environmentalism, conservatives view it as a liberal issue, so they automatically oppose it.  Thus anyone who's an environmentalist must automatically be a liberal in order to fit into this black and white us vs. them mindset.  A good example of this is James Hansen, who considers himself politically a moderate conservative, as you can tell from some of his proposals (i.e. carbon tax and return the dividend to the people rather than having the government spend it).  Yet because Hansen realizes the danger from AGW, he's automatically labeled as a liberal, even a socialist.  Another example is our buddy Jim, who once called Huddler a socialist site simply because it's green.  Huddler, which is a green products website - capitalistic in its very nature.  And of course anyone who believes AGW is a "leftist" in Jim's mind.    This sort of mindset is why talking heads like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity have jobs.  People like to see the world as black and white because it simplifies things.  If you have to actually consider whether environmental regulations might be a good thing, that's too much work.  It's much easier just to say environmental issues are liberal and thus bad.  Especially with AGW, because dismissing the opposition as "liberal whackjobs" allows deniers to dismiss the science instead of having to argue against it, which they can't.|`|uXVbvEX3aa	Environmentalists are generally associated with "tree hugging hippies"...be careful when you label yourself.

Business will typically go to the conservative side for obvious reasons. Environmentalists are, consequently, associated with the left. I think it also has a lot to do with the ideals that the two parties embrace. I don't really see Pat Robertson preaching about preserving natural habitats or holding businesses accountable for atrocious pollution.      I digress.|`|s9zefBbvaa	Most Conservatives are Pro-Business, and laws that protect the environment are often viewed as being bad for business. So, over the years, it has become a common assumption that environmentalist are Liberal....because (the assumption goes) those who are in favor of protection for the environment Must be against businesses and their success. I don't believe issues are so black & white, but that is the rational behind much of today's politics - you're either pro-business or you're anti-business!|`|E1gKL2fSaa	I think farmers are the biggest environmentalists.

There used to be more REASON behind the philosophy, but since the 60's, it has become quite a radicalized, activist movement.    Out here in Wyoming, you will find many "conservative" people talking about how to balance usage with preservation, how to maintain the lands so they aren't destroyed for future use... it leans more towards the idea of "husbandry."  But these people are very concerned about treating the environment with respect, but they simply do not WORSHIP the environment like these radical environmentalists wackos do.    And, generally speaking, these radical environmentalist wackos are on the LEFT end of the political scales.  And... trust me... any conservative, REASONABLE person who desires "husbandry" doesn't want to be associated with the nut cases on the left... so conservatives will AVOID using the nomenclature when referring to their own views.

If taxes are raised too high, the corporations will move their headquarters to foreign countries to avoid the high taxes.      Corporations are in the business of making money.  Most have a set goal on the amount of money they expect to make.  Increasing taxes will reduce the amount of profits.  Corporations won't reduce profits but will instead find other ways to increase the profit.  This will be done by not reinvesting money in new equipment or more people or by reducing the labor costs of the corporation.    Higher corporate taxes will always be a negative for the economy.|`|HEpBYfWWaa	None.|`|3785eeef30e9bd9c24c59001fddabeb6aa	Well, you can make an argument for both.  Corporations tend to generate huge profits, and taxing them more lowers the burden on individuals, on the flip side, if you tax them to much, they'll up and move to Mexico to avoid paying the taxes.  If you ask me, I think that we should get rid of the IRS completely, contract the government back to the size we had in 1999, with no corporate or personal income tax, and you'd still have a balanced budget.  Because corporations are multinational now, we need to be very competitive.  Unfortunately, we have this $1 Trillion a year empire to maintain.

You came up with 1 'racist' one--where Obama was not present AND that Obama thoroughly denounced.

GuTUQpSpaa	The teenager should have been held in jail until his 21st birthday, at least, and ordered into mandatory counseling.  He's a predator and he's not going to stop after a slap on the wrist.    The laws about molestation differ from region to region, but overall, they tend to be much too lenient.  For starters, the majority of stranger rape cases are never solved, and the closure rate for cases where the attacker was known to the victim is also depressingly low.  Of the perpetrators that are brought to trial, most end up taking plea bargains, which carry a lesser charge and generally limited jail time. It's usually those who are repeat offenders or have killed their victim(s) that do any hard time... and even the repeat offenders generally don't get particularly long sentences, which causes them to escalate over the years, eventually graduating to homicide on top of rape.  Of the ones who are put away for life, the majority had been in prison before for sexual assault (sometimes multiple times), were released, then went on to kill one of their victims.    Thing is, when it comes to sexual assault, particularly stranger rape and pedophilia, it's usually not a one-time thing.

Each person in the Army has a story about how they had to perform duties not typically covered under their MOS. And its not always a bad thing. For example, my recruiters best friend was a helicopter pilot.  Being friends, he would sometimes get to tag along on whats called "required flight time."

Government needs to stop spending in the war, withdraw the troops, liquidate/reduce debt, stop borrowing/printing money, downsize the scope of government, and concentrate on the problems we have here at home.

The Constitution does not require Members to live in the districts which they represent. The age and citizenship qualifications for representatives are less stringent than those for senators.    Furthermore, under the Fourteenth Amendment, any federal or state officer who takes the requisite oath to support the Constitution, but later engages in rebellion or aids the enemies of the United States, is disqualified from becoming a representative. The Amendment, however, allows a disqualified individual to serve if they gain consent of two-thirds of both Houses of Congress.    happy to do your homework for you,    -Shamar!|`|ayhDyb16aa	A total frontal Lobotomy|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	Must be at least 25 years old and a resident of the state in which you are running.

i0vcEyJtaa	We have a debt because we borrow from foreigners. We spend a lot in defense (CIA, FBI, NSA, Drug war, Iraq/Afghan conflicts), after defense it's health care (Medicare), we spend in education, on roads, on foreign aid, on housing, on subsidizing companies, on the wars, on federal bureaucracy, and on global organizations like the UN, NATO, and IMF.    In order to reduce debt and spending is to stop borrowing from foreigners, save money by stopping war funds, halting education/health care/welfare spending, these issues can be handled by Local/State levels. We need to reduce defense aid by 60%, withdraw troops from Korea, Germany, Japan, re-deploy them here at home.    Pay back debt when we do this, repeal NAFTA, and jobs will come home.

36H5Lk4Baa	your view on affirmative action is shared by many. Over the years, I've been on the fence and now I've come to this conclusion:  While what you wrote about a minority getting a position they are not qualified for simply because of their race or skin color is probably accurate, it's probably also the exception.   Without affirmative action many minorities would be shut out of main stream businesses, causing class and race separation, then isolation. Those are ingredients for severe civil unrest. Is it a truly fair and balanced program? Well no, it's not but it has become a necessary equalizer in the work force engine and all in all it does more good than bad.    Abortion is a staple issue that divides people. You just can't legislate anything permanent that will ignite one side or the other. I don't like the idea of abortion but I simply can't see ordering people to have children they don't want either. Just think about how many kids would grow up neglected or abused at the hands of parents who didn't want them but were forced by law to parent. I don't see a solution to this issue.    If by some tragic circumstance a member of my family were harmed by someone, I would rather know the culprit is looking at a concrete wall every morning he wakes up, day after day, for years to come. I think I would get more satisfaction from that than ending the person's life and ending his or her misery, letting them off the hook.    In the end, I think Michael Steele will redevelop the base and centrist collaboration. I think he's smart and will find a way to tap into the youth vote.Guess we're gonna' have to wait and see...|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Right now, I'm neutral.  I wish that I could jump on the bandwagon but I can't.  I have a "wait and see" attitude.  I can be flexible on two of the issues but there is one that I just can't stomach.    One issue.  That's all.  I wish that I could say "ah, it doesn't matter".  It doesn't matter to most folks.  However, most folks didn't grow up like I did.    My parents were an interracial marriage.  I was called a mutt, a half-breed and felt the prejudice from both blacks and whites.  My parents STRONGLY enforced in me that skin color doesn't matter.  Everyone is the same.  Now get out there and make something of yourself or you'll have no one to blame but yourself.  They told me that I could do anything that I wanted to do if I tried.  I believed them.  Things are much different now than they were back then.  Yet still, even then you could make it if you really wanted to.    Now (years later) I am supposed to accept that I am not capable of competing with others by my merit alone and I am supposed to have the government "help" me so that I can succeed.  Since I'm a bi-racial woman I am supposed to need extra points to get into colleges.  That companies won't hire me because my skin is darker.    I'm sorry but it's a little late for that.  I was successful and I didn't accept any help from affirmative action.  I'll keep my 3.9 GPA.  I'll keep the respect that I've earned in my field.  I'll keep my honor.  I see affirmative action as a very deep and personal insult to my intelligence and my work in my field.    I'll try my best to support him but honestly, whenever some affirmative action person tells me that I'm a "victim" and I'm not good enough to make it on my own merit, I want to spit in their faces.  The opportunity is there for everyone.  The results are up to the individual.  I don't want their help and I don't want to work with anyone who can't compete on their own.|`|tDZMJue9aa	no on affirmative action, i am white grew up poor..why should my chances not be the same as his...cause they werent...my son doesnt have the same chance as black kids in his school there are well over 1000 scholarships available to black kids only..and perhaps 20 for any race kid...is that fair...no its not...i am pro-choice and i love the death penalty and i think we should use it more often less crowding in the prisons and perhaps scare the **** out of some someday criminals into thinking twice before committing their crime..and yes i am a republican|`|v1dnnMQuaa	I'm surprised you mentioned abortion and not stem cell research.

I think he was a good choice.|`|4vLt3SqFaa	I do not blame Steele for his view of affirmative action - it is a product of his background as a child during the civil rights movement, but one must always bear ion mind that the battles of decades ago do not always reflect the battle facing today's young people.  So respect his history but disagree with the concept that discrimination cures discrimination.  I believe that this continues and aggravates the racial conflicts rather than helps resolve them.  Victim-hood has never helped anyone and the sooner it ends the better for all concerned.      Chairmen do not represent the entire party.  He holds the view that the republican party must try and expand the tent to others with more moderate views. I am are for being inclusive but what united us needs to be principles.  It is sort of like allowing imigration where new Americans do not embrace the concept of being an American citizen.  To my mind  Steeles stated views mean he would favor candidates like Mccain who is as moderate as they come.     Republicans must stand for something and moderates are not it.  Being a moderate is basically not making a choice about having values - it is a gutless choice.  To my mind being republican has always meant holding core values about both the country and the role of government.  My first presidential vote was for Ronald Reagan.      The Republican party is split between the so called intellectuals and the conservatives.  between those who want core values and those who think victory is achieved by moving to the center.  The two sides are categorically opposed to each other on basic values.  I like Steele and his fiscal views but I do think he leans too much towards the moderate wing of the party to unify the base.  Our recent moderate canidate showed how string mioderate support was.  Only Palin on the ticket got Mccain as close Obama as he was.  Without the base supporting him that Palin brought, he would have lost by 12-16% easily.  I was at McCain events.  I can tell you that nearly everyone there was there for Palin not Mccain.  The enthusiasm for her was overwhelming.    Other moderate canidates of recent years have been real sleepers - Bob Dole, George H W Bush.  The base may have voted, but had no enthusiasm for them.|`|DfK4JSytaa	I can only say that after reading the question and all the answers, I have experienced the first glimmer of hope that I've experienced in a long time.

You either have talent or you don't. Your deeds and actions should  be the only criteria for acceptance,    Abortion: From my Law enforcement career, and my military career,  I must plead the 5th. This to me, is a right of passage for the mother  to make and competent medical personnel. Without contributing  medical and or legal factors involved I believe the child should be   carried to full term if possible and then given up for adoption, So  as u can see I'm kinda on the fence on this one,    As far as the Death Penalty, I will only say, that once the DNA and  or smoking gun evidence is no longer subject to interpretation and   no longer subject to being wrong, but only conclusive, Hang the   bastard.

Apparently no american wants to raise their children!|`|8704d6bf53d5099969addcfa560ad9eaaa	Obama only picked them so that he has someone else to take the blame when Obama ruins our country.  What a shameful waste of votes!|`|1amF7oNwaa	LOOKS THAT WAY
tqD9xUpYaa	Kentucky doesn't have a smoking ban.  There are many other states as well.  You can develop your own list from the link below.    I really only care about Ohio, where I live.  It has a ban and I'm a smoker.  I still can't stand being in a bar and having a beer and not being able to enjoy a cigarette with my beer!
JDltTREfaa	Are you still in high school and getting ready to go to a four year college?  If so, it doesn't really matter what you study.  I attended law school with people who had degrees in everything from political science, criminal justice, sociology, psychology, nursing, biology, etc.  As long as you get good grades, get a four year degree in something, and get a decent score on the LSAT, you'll be able to apply to law school.    If you're about to get your four year degree and you want to persuade them that the law is a good career choice, I guess you would need to figure out what is important to your parents and what their objections to the law are.  My entire family was thrilled at my decision to become a lawyer.  We're a military family and they all knew me enough to know that I wasn't going to be one of the ambulance chasing, blood sucking, sue McDonalds for dumping coffee into your own lap kind of lawyer.  I use my law license to help people.  I work for a pro bono law clinic and provide legal services for people who can't afford to hire a lawyer.      I don't earn a huge salary, but I had some great scholarships in college and lawschool so my student loan debt was really low.  I'm pretty happy with everything!|`|0JL3Mg78aa	You have to get a bachelors degree first, so get a degree in something you like, and then apply to law school afterward.  Problem solved.|`|6JXrlnYsaa	If you're over 18, you are legally an adult and you don't need their permission for anything.    Why are you even asking them?|`|rUNlmQG5aa	Welcome to the most well paid but least productive segment of society, add to that the fact that there are nearly as many people attending law school as are practicing law right now. This is an enormous waste of educational potential at best and should no longer be suffered if we may train competent engineers for the same or similar cost. Your parents are right- don't become a parasite, learn to contribute.Remember this- our country is really stupid, OK.|`|YsBrTBmIaa	Because you will support them if they ever get into any legal trouble ;) *HINT HINT*|`|bgtNYOp5aa	Your a Greedy bastard and want to take peoples money and create wasteless lawsuits against innocent people.|`|c6a9a1a3c9c51130f64f579fb6522cf3aa	...money?|`|z88IMXNFaa	There's a glut of lawyers in this country and most graduates cannot find a job that pays enough to live on and pay off their student loans.  Plus, more and more law firms and corporations are outsourcing their legal work to India.  It will cost you at least $150,000 to go to law school - that's after 4 years of college.  How do you plan to pay off that kind of debt without a job?    Forget law school.
JDltTREfaa	If you can get documentation from your brother's doctor stating that his medical condition makes the heavier tinting a medical necessity and forward that you can probably get the ticket dismissed.    My grandmother actually had a "prescription" for heavier tinting.  We kept a copy in every vehicle she rode in so we could present it to any officer or trooper who might have stopped us.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Medical Exemptions can be purchased from the Department of Motor Vehicles for Lupus patients.         This exemption allows you to put a darker window tinting on your vehicle that is normally allowed by law. The exemption stays with the vehicle and upon sale of the vehicle, the darker tinting must be removed.    To find out your state laws on auto window tinting, go here:   http://www.autowindowtinting.com/stateLa...|`|0JL3Mg78aa	Yes, you can go to the court and  tell the judge.  Do what the other person said and file any medical reasons forms before you go.|`|tqD9xUpYaa	I doubt your brother's lupus will help you with the window tint after the fact.  If you wanted to have darker than legal tint on your windows, you probably should have consulted the courts and his doctor before having the illegal tint applied.    This would be similar to parking in a handicapped zone without a permit rather than getting the permit and then parking in the zone.|`|QONFn7vXaa	I'd follow both suggestions above and then go to court and talk to the Judge.  Be supper polite and respectful to the Trooper and explain that you did not know that you could get a prescription and/or a DMV notice and show the Judge that you have obtained them for any further incidences.  Judges are usually pretty understanding if you are nice & respectful and can show that you have educated yourself before your court date.  Good Luck, I don't see why any Judge would make you pay that ticket.|`|992f4ed91495448a70fe8e6c36df9007aa	No. You need to apply for a suntinting exemption based on medical need. Contact your state department of motor vehicles and highway safetly for an application. The doctor will have to sign it.|`|BUI2nlUVaa	Come on, really?  Are you trying to use your brother's disease to get out of a ticket...grow up.  There are many, many people out there with severe lupus and severe sun sensitivity who are able to normally drive in a car without any problems.  First off, most regular window glass has UV block in it, secondly the window pane blocks the damaging rays and thirdly, he can wear sunblock like every other person with Lupus and avoid the problem completely.    My wife has had severe organ involved Lupus for 25 years and she still has to obey all the traffic laws.  Pay the ticket and fix the tint.  End of story.
