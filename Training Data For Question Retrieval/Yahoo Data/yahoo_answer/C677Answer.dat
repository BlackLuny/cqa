xXa3eQOeaa	First off, THIS should have been resolved BEFORE he even proposed.<br>  IF he knew how important this was to you, he should have stepped down, because he obviously isn't YOUR "right guy". If YOU did not make this clear BEFORE you said "I do", this is YOUR fault, as you married him thinking you could "change him". Why do Women always do that, then get upset, when he simply won't change?<br>  YOU knew this before you married him. Here are your choices:<br>  1- Treat his daughter as your own(not one bit of THIS is her fault), as you claim to. You may earn a special place in her heart. SHE is not "raised" yet, she's only 6!!!<br>  2- Get a divorce. Find someone who wants to be part of YOUR "plan".<br>  <br>  It really IS "as simple as that". Be an adult, make an intelligent decision. You already made a foolish one. This was your mistake, not his.|`|CCFhjtNBaa	This would be a deal breaker for most women and you if you knew before you got married, shame on you for thinking you could change him. Now If I was you, I'd leave because your not getting any younger and you need to find the right guy who's nice and wants kids.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	this is something u really should have talked about before marriage.now that you are married its a little late. you can always trick him,but that is not right at all. so u really just have to deal with it. if hes not willing to change then thats that. it really sucks and im sorry.|`|707gOCvbaa	You have 2 choices? Stay and hope he changes his mind or leave him and find someone that wishes to start a family. . In the end only you can decide what you want. good luck.|`|PwmgKx2eaa	which is more important?  only you can decide. if it were me, i'd get a divorce.|`|OHfZFR31aa	This should have been discussed before getting married. If you would have communicated before you walked down the aisle, this wouldn't be an issue now.<br>  <br>  He's already been a father for 6 years and knows by now if he wants more kids or not. If he definitely does not want more and you do, then find another man who WANTS to have children with you. It's something you need to discuss while you are dating, before you even think of getting engaged.<br>  <br>  Don't expect him to change his mind. A friend who is 8 months pregnant had her husband of 7 years walk out on her because he never wanted kids and doesn't want to be a father. He said he will pay child support but doesn't want any involvement with his kid. She's devastated because he never said he definitely didn't want kids - he was always non-committal about it and she though he'd change his mind. But now she's going to be a single mother in a month and it's killing her.|`|wPD3BGEHaa	This is definitely something that you and your husband should have discussed before you got married. I believe that if you really want a child and he really doesn't want another one then this may cause serious problems in your marriage. Seriously consider if this is going to work out or not now because it is better to cut your loses and lick your wounds now while you are so young than years from now when there are more emotions to deal with.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	Why did you marry someone who didn't want kids?  That should have been the end of your dating, before you married.  Did you think you'd change him?  If so, stupid?  If he changed his mind after he married you, I wouldn't stay married to him.  That is not fair.  Either way, you now have to decide if you want to stay married to him and not have children or to end the relationship and the marriage.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	Discussing this BEFORE marriage was the proper order, don't you think?   <br>  If you know what you want  and you know he didn't want what you want, you should of held out for a man who did want what you do.<br>  <br>  He married you for better or worse, so just get pg  and make him deal with it.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	He sounds a selfish pig. Why on earth was this not discussed before you married him. If he is not going to change his mind you have no choice but to divorce, he cannot deny you your chance to have your own children.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Too bad all those childless men who were interested in you were losers eh ? Maybe its time to lower the standards and look elsewhere ?|`|AA11538662	This should have been discussed before marriage, it would have saved a lot of issues now.<br>  <br>  Now, you will have to decide what it is you want to do about this situation. You are young and I do understand your desire to become a mommy. So, if hubby won't agree to a child or children, you have to decide if this is where you will be spending your life, you will continue to feel cheated and this will only get worse as your biological time clocks starts to tick. So, you either divorce him and move on and find someone with the same desires as you to be parents or you live being miserable inside forever.<br>  <br>  Maybe you & hubby can sit down and have a heart to heart and tell him what you deeply want and if he can not oblige, that you will have no other choice but to divorce him and move on to find someone that shares the same desire as you.<br>  <br>  Boy, this really should have been resolved prior to marriage then you could have made the choice then before you married.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you & I hope you do find your true happiness in being a mommy.<br>  <br>  Mary in Camden, MI|`|d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	Don't use any birth control and just have a child. It's your dream so live it. Just one thing though, if after you have the child, he doesn't want it and files for divorce, don't go after him for support. Take care of the child yourself since you wanted it in the first place. I do understand about you wanting your own child. His daughter is not yours. He can't even begin to understand your feelings because he has a child. Divorce is not the answer. Don't divorce and look for someone else. That next guy may be horror and terror to deal with. Don't feel that it is dishonest to just get pregnant either. This is your husband and your marriage and you should be able to at least have one child.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	You need to give him some time and space.  For some reason he doesnt feel ready for another child. There can be alot o freasons for this.  But if you show him you are willing to meet him part way you will be rewarded. He will appreciate you and love you even more.  Tell him you want a child but you are willing to wait till he is ready.  Then work on building your marriage and the time will come that he wants it to.  I know a couple who went through this and she snuck and got off her birth control. She got preg and he really resented her and the baby. It has ruined their relationship because he feels betrayed. <br>  good luck. Iknow its hard and difficult time for you. If it keeps eating at your heart then make an appt with a therapist to help you learn ways to deal with waiting.   Take care and hope you find peace.|`|bcea9e0597ee026b8f88013b95d84be3aa	If you think you are cheated now think how that child will feel! Bringing a child into a relationship where there is only one nurturing parent is very childish and inconsiderate of you. I don't think you have thought this one through.|`|zkPSQs7xaa	Give him an ultimatum and respect his choice. If he still is adamant he doesnt want kids move on or you will resent him.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	huh.  apparently you should have had this conversation before you ran to get married toots.|`|YZDwA8psaa	you should divorce and marry another guy|`|RfRGyweCaa	you should have found a man who didn't have a child and who wants kids|`|c28925a42319d47558b135bd8dc66e6daa	get a divorce|`|IPJ5LMMRaa	I have been there before. Before we got married he said he wanted them. When I had to face surgery for my endometriosis the doctor said it's time to have them if you're going to. He freaked out and said he didn't want them. We fought long and hard about this. In the end, we separated, because I would not be happy without children and he really didn't want to have them.<br>  Do not ever get pregnant thinking that once he sees the child he will change, he might "like" the child, but he will not like you. He'll resent you for it.<br>  Make up your mind about what you want to do and what you're willing to give up for your relationship, then tell him and see what he does. Be prepared for the worst and make sure you're ready to follow through.|`|kTUL01tfaa	you are cheated, you have a God given right to have children seeing as you are married. Children are a blessing from the Lord, he has no right to deny you. He is extremely selfish. Get pregnant anyway, this is not deception, there is no discussion, you have the right to have children and he is stealing your right away. Who knows the future? you could go years being sad and bitter and at 40 he gets some other girl pregnant. His daughter is not yours, you have the need for your own baby in your arms, I understand. Quit your job and stay home, part of this could be he wants your paycheck to continue.|`|y0DYwomYaa	give it time. he needs a little space. he loves his daughter but you guys are still young you have time. ask him if he would be intrested in doing foster care, this way he starts to see children, maybe alls he needs is to see an after. when the kid gets bigger (espically boys) how they can go to games and have fun. in the end i think he will change his mind, but give it time, this is a relationship that takes two, a decision that takes two, and if you both dont want it there has to be a mutual decision you can both come to undestand and benifit from

You are still really young and a lot of people your age certainly cannot say they had a two year relationship at all.  Sounds like you know how to treat someone you just lack the balls a bit to ask someone out.  In todays society it's not all that hard just to ask someone out.  If they say no, so what, move on at least you've tried.  Don't kick yourself for being turned down trying to find a new girlfriend it happens.

You still love her and want to support her but she MUST realise its not fair for her to expect other people to all stop their lives just because she's had a tough time. She's just attention seeking basically, wanting her parents to notice HER instead of thinking about themselves all the time.

Take things slow, and in a YEAR after dating....you can tell her this, maybe even 6 months.<br>  <br>  But if you feel this way, and feel she might share those same feelings, ask her to go for a walk, or some activity were you guys can talk in person.  Dinner isn't good--to busy eating, Movie isn't good--to busy watching.  Try going out for coffee, keep the first date brief, the goal here is to keep her interested, if you put everything you have to offer on the table right away...then the excitement for her to continue to meet with you is gone.<br>  <br>  date 1 -coffee date (or whatever your beverage of choice is)<br>  date 2 - fun activity (skiing, snow shoeing, ice skating, go for a walk, go to a game...something she likes<br>  date 3- dinner and a movie<br>  date 4- her choice<br>  date 5- you're golden and can assume this is going somewhere.<br>  <br>  Keep things light and fun...nothing serious like you speech above until after she's told you she loves you. <br>  <br>  Depending on you timing she will find your speech creepy or romantic.  (to soon=creepy)<br>  <br>  Hope this is what you're looking for!!! and GOOD-LUCK!
AcgDcQG0aa	Yes, I'd say this is a relatively minor form of abuse.  As long as you don't have any bruises or visible scars.  Then the authorities probably won't do anything about it.  <br>  <br>  The best you can do is avoid your father as much as you can and concentrate on your school.  So that when you turn 18 years of age.  Then you will be prepared to move out and live on your own.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	Call the police. Seriously.|`|fBVW11xGaa	Call the police. Get in touch with someone quick. <br>  <br>  tell you what tell your Dad if he wants someone to push around i will come see his *** and see how big and grumpy he is with me. <br>  <br>  Seriously..... call someone anyone just get out, you do know that you can divorce your parents. drastic maybe|`|AA11180444	It sounds like your dad may be depressed or else he is just unhappy with life in general (money, job, marriage).  There may be other things going on that you don't know about, like stuff between your parents that either of them won't tell you.  Things you wouldn't want to know about, like money problems an affair, or just plain trust issues.  Don't take any of what your dad says personally.  Like your mom says he's just grumpy....in not so many words she's telling you that he is an unhappy man.  Your mom should listen to you because if you can't talk to her about this, who can you talk to?  She is the closest to the situation that would understand your feelings.  If your mom tends to agree more with your dad, and if you aren't happy with a school counselor, then maybe you should tell your mom that dad is right and you'd like to start seeing a professional counselor.  Counselors are there to see your point of view and help you get beyond the problem.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you have to go through all this crap.  Trust me when I say that all of this will make you a stronger adult.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!
D3hYbsVJaa	What I want to know is where the snap are all you initiating women? You need to put on seminars for women like my wife. She is wonderfully open to intimacy with me, but it seems like she's afraid to try anything, no matter how much I encourage her.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	If a man wants to be with you, he will call you, and ask you out, etc.|`|eb60e1f3b263ec23d3ce29f87f8756acaa	I just think it's funny and kind of sad how women act like perusing a man is somehow beneath them or something. Back in the 1970s with that whole women's lib thing women were saying that they shouldn't have to wait around on guys to ask them out and that they were going to start doing it. <br>  <br>  But it seems that women tried it and realized that, alas, rejection hurts. So women decided that they liked men having to take all the risks after all. Yet they still sit back and complain about having to wait on guys to do anything. <br>  <br>  I know plenty of guys who complain about always having to initiate sex and now you know how it feels. It feels like your partner is not interested, right? Well that's how guys feel who have women who always make the guy initiate everything. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't be in a relationship like that. Thank God my wife isn't that way.|`|X2QUJsUaaa	I'm not a girl, so deal with my answer please. Why do girls stay with guys like that? It's because that is how she is. Plain and simple. Some girls like the chase, and the challenge, basically taking the stereotypical male role in the relationship. Typically, but not all the time, they are the tom boyish type.<br>  <br>  Haven't you looked at it that way "Tom" that in fact it's role reversal.|`|rwrDD14Jaa	well maybe the guy wasn't ready for sex or maybe he wasnt that attracted to you. You can't just assume that all guys are horny sex obsessed pigs.|`|3rBYqlCJaa	yess thats me! i hate it so much! but im a virgin lmao, but im the one that if it wasnt because of me and my ex wouldent of ever had been together nor we would of talked at least by text! i hate it so much! tell me about ur story, just email me

It sounds like he doesn't even know what protege means, his context doesn't make sence. Secondly, refering to love and husband and wife in text????? and you havn't even been on a date???  Scary!!!|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	He has no concept of the meaning of the word.  Tell him to grow up.
i9nlUZb0aa	You should be honest with them. Tell them the truth. Let them know that people are getting hurt too. Let them know that every time they insult someone for something they do that it really bothers them. And when they brag about themselves it becomes very annoying. that they shouldn't flaunt about themselves all the time. Its ok to be happy about yourself, but those less fortunately you should also be happy for, and not negative. Someone needs to let them know now before it gets worse and who better then a relative like yourself. Good-luck|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	When you are with them you shut up, smile and pretend to be nice.
cmEi3CVqaa	ask your son what she likes to eat/her favourite meal, if that sounds too difficult or you've never heard of it then think of something that is traditional to your home town and ask your son if she would like that. <br>  <br>  good luck (: x|`|i1rDJY2aaa	Call her and ask her what her favorite meal is - it's a good way to break the ice!|`|d1862ba8e4c727c54e3035f0293c5a14aa	Nothing too different. I had my friends over and made a bunch of fucocchia(sp?) sandwiches and the ones I loved the most with onions and all the goodies didn't get taken. The boring plain ones were the ones that people went nuts for. Maybe you could ask your son what she likes and is there anything she talks about having back home that she misses.|`|AA10473274	You should all go out to eat at a nice restaurant.

i4bjQbPcaa	I think you are an attention seeker who is playing games in a relationship to make her boyfriend 'prove' he loves you, when you show him very little love or respect.<br>  <br>  You sound annoyed that he won't wait for you whilst you swan off abroad to have whatever fun you feel like.  No of course he won't, its not very fair on him if you have been together for 2 1/2 years and you decide you want a break.  Don't you think you should discuss these things as a couple.  <br>  <br>  You say you only see each other once a week, how about making time for each other rather than getting him to drive you everywhere.  If it's not working then end it.  Find someone else (a friend) to go on holiday with instead, it won't cost too much to change the names on the tickets|`|498JdszFaa	Follow your gut feeling. If you two are done, then don't go on that holiday, it will be a waste of money and a major disappointment. The fact that you want to work abroad and his attitude towards you and his health... It all adds to the snapshot of a love gone by.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	if you're going to work for just a few months, i don't see why he can't wait for you, however if its for a few years, don't expect him to wait, that wouldn't be fair to him. relationship takes effort and time spent together.<br>  <br>  i think he's just being very lazy. he does seem to let himself go. he doesn't care about his weight, or health and he seems to pout about driving you everywhere. where is YOUR own car? if you start driving yourself, he'll realize that you're not relying on him for anything anymore and maybe he'll come around.<br>  <br>  if i were in your shoes i would just cut to the chase and ask him where he stands in the relationship.|`|uhZneNORaa	He doesn't sound very great.. If he says he doesnt bother to wait for you he is definetly not worth it. But maybe he says it because he doesnt want you to go because he does like you alot.. You should ask him why he wont wait. But it sounds like you should dump him..|`|0XGWM9nUaa	dump him before he dumps you! and tell him how he made u feel like you dont mean anything....|`|GUUa1s6Laa	Is unbooking the holiday even an option? I mean like, are you even allowed by the company to cancel?<br>  It sounds like your boyfriend doesnt appreciate you and doesnt respect himself. Is he depressed do you think? Those signs like signs of depression. Or laziness.<br>  I think its time to move on, he is not willing to wait for you means he doesnt support your dreams, which is not marriage material. You need to consider if you are happier with him then not. As in , 50% of the time you feel happy? I find most of the time people don't end the relationship until the are unhappy more than 50% of the time. Or when the bad moments out weigh the goood.<br>  As for the vacation, that is... 2 months away. Can you continue this thinking pattern for two months and not let him in on it? I think you are absolutely right about the vacation testing your relationship. Will it ruin your vacation?I find that once you start thinking you dont want to be with someone, its like every time you are with them the pressure builds and builds, until finally you cant handle it, even if you are waiting for something, often the case.<br>  I think you need to weigh your pros and cons and ask yourself those questions.|`|NP98ui6xaa	He sounds like a good guy that just needs a wake up call..<br>  dump him for like a day and tell him you only did it to wake his *** up and tell him you dont wanna be with him if he is going to be the way he is.. and he is losing you.. and youll scare the **** outaa him and thats good! and im sure that will help! i have experience, he sounds Identical to me.. except the gaining weight.. im in crazy shape. i choose the gym over a girl anyday lol|`|nhG4hUNAaa	The first part of your question says it all, he would not wait for you<br>  <br>  You are worth it so get rid cos he aint worth it. If he cared he would let you do what you want and encourage you and support you to do it.<br>  <br>  your have a wonderful life ahead - go be a childrens rep and be happy instead of drowning on this loser<br>  <br>  Peter|`|iembGsl9aa	You want to go away for a few MONTHS and he's not willing to wait for you? <br>  Dump the bastard. 2 or 3 months should not be a huge factor as long as you are keeping close communication.<br>  He is trying to block your dreams, and it's not healthy. <br>  <br>  See if you can find someone else to go on holiday with.|`|oIuWWH8yaa	yeah, I’m not saying ‘dump’ him, but just let him know the basic facts, and<br>  maybe even threatening to leave him would work,<br>  but if he’s complaining, and not willing to wait<br>  for you, that’s pretty lousy, you could find<br>  someone so much better than that, and <br>  someone who takes care of their self too.|`|2zKBJkM8aa	You have to figure out your priorities.  What's more important, a vacation or your self-worth?  Yes, it would be a waste of money, but there is something far worse than that; a waste of TIME.   And that's what this boyfriend of yours is.|`|5mWZrA97aa	u?dont?deserve?him<br>  there?r?better?boys?out?there.<br>  dump?him?and?save?ur?money<br>  I?promise?God?will?not?let<br>  u?down.Just?make?the?right?choice?<br>  than?ruining?your?future<br>  =]|`|6Rru2901aa	I don't drive, my bf does and he doesn't like driving too much so I often stay over at his place at least for 2 days so he doesn't have to go back and forth. If it's been 2 years and he's not willing to wait for you or even go with you then he probably doesn't really love you.<br>  You need to find someone who is willing to fight the fight with you, I assume after 2 years and a half, you may have thought of marriage, so anything you do in college will be for both of you. I say go on the trip see how it goes, if you break up before still on the trip and enjoy it. One doesn't need a man to feel beautiful and enjoy a trip!<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  Moe.|`|q84KT11saa	If I were you, considering you already booked the trip, just go.  Have fun.  Enjoy yourself.  Don't let him spoil it for you.  Sounds to me like you have already made up your mind about him.  If he has already said that he is not willing to wait for you, then he can't be all that serious about you.  If I felt the way you did about the relationship, I would go on the trip, and afterward call it quits.|`|dlf5pTueaa	About his health, tell his parents and urge them to see a doctor. Go to your own doctor or a doctor near you and tell them you need help; explain the situation.|`|YeIDYkBxaa	maybe u should talk it out with him.  tell him how u feel.  if he doesnt listen make him listen. u wear the pants in the realtionship if he really does like u then he would listen and try to improve himself if he doesnt then dump as a patatoe|`|rscHoVntaa	Dump him.

Oh no- he's the one not worth it. But before you decide on anything, try to see and understand his side and feelings as well.<br>  And seriously- do you still love him? And from what you're saying, I'd think that he doesn't listen to you and is very arrogant. <br>  I would say to let him go... or spend some time away from each other or try and solve the problem together.<br>  <br>  Again, try to understand and listen to his side and understand him and what he's feeling right now. Maybe he doesn't want to go to the doctors because he's afraid perhaps? Scared?<br>  But urge him to go and give him courage and be brave! lol<br>  But don't say the scared parts because he might go berserk! maybe not, but you know: that's something he'd have to admit on his own.|`|jregy4Uwaa	He doesn't sound like a winner.<br>  Just because he can't value what he has in front of him doesn't make you unworthy. <br>  I think I can understand how you feel. I've in a situation before where I knew things just weren't going to end up with a happy ending and yet I still wanted the guy to like me, even though I knew he wasn't exactly what I wanted.<br>  I wouldn't cancel that trip abroad.<br>  You just can't force someone to care about you. And from what you wrote he really doesn't seem worth it to even try.|`|rKCueXHdaa	I would go on the vavaction with him still and see how it goes. While on vacation(or whatever you guys were going) Id think about what YOU want. If you want to continue trying with him I would sit him down and really talk to him and have a "take it or leave it" conversation. Meaning tell him like it is, Tell him youd liek it if he'd wait for you. & if your not willing to wait for me tell me now and I can find someone willing to. He can either say one or two things. Make it simple. And as for his health, If he doesn't want to take care of himself he will just face the consequences later. Im sure your healthy, So don't let his health worries be your worries. Let it be his.

JhOcPHEsaa	This is a very sad situation,the reason her dad probably did that was because he is possesed and needs the word of god in him to cast out that demonic spirit.My advice is you should tell them that her dad is going to a depression and no matter what everybody has to help this man out, a divorce is not an answer to all this situation.The reason why is because with a divorce this time the poor man can really kill himself and suffer even more than what he is. I suggest for you to tell them to help him out and give this person treatment. hurry up before anything crazy happens.Seek the lords words and spread it to them and pray.|`|vdfEE7WTaa	Tell her that you're there for her 24/7 or something.

AA10473274	Your male friend obviously isn't a good friend. He didn't want you there. Your close female friend doesn't have a phone???? She couldn't call you from a payphone when they were out???? I honestly think it's time to find better friends. Tell him you know that he didn't want you to hang with them. If he asks you how you found out tell him "it doesn't matter how I found out, what matters is my so called friend screwed me over" Don't make a big deal out of it but make sure you tell him "thanks a lot friend" then walk away. If he was ever your friend he'll apologize, if he doesn't then you know he never was.|`|cmEi3CVqaa	well it's either a really big misunderstanding that your over reacting to or your friends are being deliberately excluding you. either talk to them about it, ask them why you wern't invited and tell them everything that you've heard from people as you should let ur friends know that your not stupid and people do tell you things whether they wanted them to or not. if they are excluding you on purpose, you are in the right here, not them!<br>  <br>  if u don't fancy confronting them, then why don't you try ur best to 1) make some other friends so you have people who you can fall back on as your friendships elsewhere are struggling currently and 2) you could make the arrangements to meet, that way you will always be included as you made the meetings and will obviously be there. if they continuously say say no or make excuses why they can't go then really the only other option is talk to the and explain whats been happening, how ur feeling and ask them what they're doing and why they're doing it. <br>  <br>  hope it helps x|`|PEVkrOVVaa	You can't do that without letting the friend know the other friend told you and you'd be breaking a promise.  Get over it.  It happens.  There are times we all want to go out with other people and not really with those we see everyday, Nothing personal in it, unless you feel they are doing this deliberately, then I guess they really are not as close to you as you seem to think they are.  I suggest you ignore their behavior, and get some life of your own, which means, go out on your own with other friends, and if your "close" friends should ask why you did not invite them, then you can approach the subject with some justification.  If they don't that means they really don't care that much and you need some other good friends.
lWUknox6aa	ya, my husband is on my lazy list.  lol.  Sometimes I get so frustrated trying to get everything done.  Even when he see's the house is a disaster, he does nothing about it.  I've tried talking to him several times about helping me out more.  Sometimes the talks work and he will help for a couple days but after that, it's back to being lazy.  I just chose my battles now.  He says it helps him if I make him a list of things to be done.  I think it's just the way they were raised.  He probably didn't have to clean up after himself growing up so now he doesn't know how to do it as an adult.  just try talking to him more about it...good luck to us both!|`|2DKRF3qoaa	Tell him to help out, if he wants to get his laundry done, or anything else... Tell him to do his part.  Also, get him to wash his own laundry for a few weeks. Also, get him to do the work that you would do if you have to. Make him countable for the things he does.|`|426a3dee7ed8c56e74b81f48767f2bbaaa	No it isn't right but I do this same thing at different times. I guess it's a man thing and we need to get over it. I do the outside work and she does the inside. We help each other once in a while. Sorry but get his attention before saying something next. (2x4 works for me)|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Aaahhh, the sweet sounds of wedded bliss.|`|mPfDlG2Laa	Sounds to me like he has a lot of growing up to do before he is ready to play house.  A relationship is work with a great deal of give and take involved.  Being a couple takes a huge amount of work, it isn't all flowers, candy and lovin'-that's all icing on the cake.  Flowers and a show are nice, but that doesn't fix the dripping faucet or change the dirty diapers.  He has shown he can take, now he has to show that he can give.  Ask yourself this; mother of two, or three?
63a5e4aa71cbea07611f89f87df0073eaa	I would see how your beau feels about it. If they ask about it directly, you might say that he had previous relationship that is officially over.   As long as he has been open and up front about it with you, that's what is most important.<br>  <br>  Try to agree on an answer with your beau so that he doesn't feel blindsided if he happens to meet your friends on other occasions, however!|`|AA11538662	Well at least your not seeing a married man, right?

n8lXItGraa	Plain and simple my dear, she's sick of being used by you.  It's obvious she has feelings for you and wants more than a booty call...as she hinted when she said she wanted a man of her own.  It sounds like even though she has feelings, she is trying to let go of you.  She will have periods when she misses you so much, and feel bad because she hasn't called you..so will call or text.  She needs you more than you want her...and she knows that.  It's hard to be in love with someone you can't have.  Eventually if things continue like this, she will no longer call you at all.  She will tell herself she's had enough and will try to find someone that will treat her with love and respect...something she hasn't gotten from you.  <br>  If she wanted to talk to you the night you called...favorite show on or not...she would have answered.  Then the following day she felt bad, and used the excuse about her favorite show and the phone being turned off.  She's probably been riding an emotional rollercoaster for sometime now.  Now my question to you is...do you love this woman?  Are you prepared to have her in your life in a meaningful relationship?  Will you be single?   If the answer to these questions is no...for God sake let her go. Leave her alone to find her own happiness, she deserves that...don't you think?  If the answers to the questions are yes...go to her and tell her how you feel.  You're running out of time...she's not waiting anymore.  Hope this helps...|`|4c655677b43f3ad2987b10a4703cb3c0aa	It sounds like she has given up on having a relationship with you and is now using you for sex.  Good for her!!|`|0WnYz7Z4aa	Moat likely she got tired of you , and got her self new friend .|`|oW4nY3ryaa	You're a pig and should give the woman a break.  You've never spent the night over there before so you don't know how she normally conducts herself in the morning.  Why should she change her routine for you?  <br>  <br>  If she's dumb enough to take you in and tell you that you're welcome there anytime, why do you have any reason to believe that she means otherwise?  Cheaters always assume that other people are as deceitful as they are.
jOLtcXufaa	maybe you should talk to her about this, but it does sound like shes in it for the same reason she was a t first.... sex and thats it

LAXbJfvwaa	Most hymns are quite easy to transpose - your organist/pianist (or whoever is playing) will be able to do this for most songs if you ask.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise, hymns are usually not to high so I assume you mean two G's above middle C?  That should be reasonably easy for a Mezzo to get, however it is probably in your passagio which makes it hard.  To try and get up there use more rounded vowels (no one will notice that you aren't singing the words exactly right at that range).  <br>  <br>  The other thing is just to sing what you can and just mime the higher stuff - I am sure no one else will notice.  Even if you mimed the whole thing it probably wouldn't be noticable (except to *maybe* your fiance/hubby!)  <br>  <br>  And does it really matter if you don't sing perfectly?  I mean you are not there to give them a show - it is group singing to show your love for God - no one really cares how bad it is - no need to stress over it!|`|onbwN4csaa	I'm assuming that you will be singing with others. sing for real and at those high notes let the others carry you. I mean you can only do what you can do.<br>  but be there throughout the song.

Hugs can be as simple as friendly hugs.<br>  <br>  I think you should definitely stop being too aggressive for now. Wait until she makes it clear that she does likes you, and wants the relationship to move on further. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, she might feel way too uncomfortable to even be your friend.

If he doesn't say stuff like this on a regular basis, then maybe his mind just happened to be elsewhere. As for you, maybe you were being too sensitive, but oh well. You were in a good mood and had your bubble popped, so of course you won't be the same!|`|01a19d2b8982bebcfca1b5520fa5d1e1aa	I think you are being a little too sensitive and him being a little insensitive saying that.<br>  But let it go. <br>  <br>  I agree with the other person<br>  He obviously didnt want to talk and you did...nobody's really at fault.<br>  <br>  Its what they call "not being on the same page" at the time.<br>  <br>  It wont be the last time either.<br>  Maybe next time ask..can I ask you some things about _____ and see if he wants to discuss it first|`|KmC0K59taa	I would have been upset too.

I would have asked him what his @#$% problem was, since he wanted to ruin your good mood (he was obviously not in a good mood himself). And when he says you're being too sensitive, you should say "I'm not being too sensitive. You were just being a jerk and trying to ruin my good mood. If you didn't feel like talking you could have just said that, instead of insulting me and making me feel like you don't want me involved with your life!" lol that's a bit wordy, but yeah. That's what I'd say.|`|kTUL01tfaa	I'm a woman but I don't talk alot.

We like to chat and talk about how we feel.  He does need to listen and actively participate in your conversations, but we need other women to be able to chat with and vent to.  Its just like if you have a problem, you really just want to talk about it and not really looking for a solution.   A man will be looking to solve what you asking just because that is the way they process and think about things.  He needs to realize he should want to listen to you and actually care to hear you.  Talk to him about how you felt and maybe you will be able to open up lines of communication.|`|4uuubr3Haa	lol.. next time he says something (anything), cut him off mid sentence and tell him "shut up, u talk to much" then laugh. If it makes u feel like you are being rude, then he was probably being rude. If u find it kind of funny, then he was just trying to be cute with u. I think it was the second option to be honest. Sometimes us women take things a little too seriously.|`|yBBjTVQaaa	In a word yes. But that's just the way women are. This senario happens to me with my boyfriend all the time. Men are women are just so different. I have to say that I always go in a huff aswell.

See if he'd like to help you pick out baby stuff, or go with you to your appointments. If you're having a tough time and need his support there isn't anything wrong with just asking for it. If the two of you are still cool then maybe he won't mind. Maybe you could try texting him back that you could really use a friend right now and you'd like it to be him.

Although its not my "style", she is human and she has her rights. She can do whatever or whoever she wants. I say as long as your being safe [[even though you can't get pregnant anymore, there are still STD's]] more power to you. Women have need too just like men.

Now that I'm pregnant can I still have sex, and if so, for how long into my pregnancy?<br>  <br>  A. Sex in pregnancy is wonderful! You can continue to have sex as far into pregnancy, right up until birth, as you and your partner are comfortable. This includes orgasms. There are a few reasons why you shouldn't have sex during certain periods during pregnancy. These include:<br>  <br>      * Bleeding<br>      * Preterm Labor<br>      * Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) (you or your partner) <br>  <br>  Be sure to talk to your practitioner about specifics for you. When your practitioner says, "No sex." Find out what they mean, do them mean no orgasms? Do they mean no intercourse? If so, for how long? For example, if a woman has a slight bit of bleeding in the first trimester, it's common to be told to avoid intercourse and orgasm for the period of one week from the last episode of bleeding.<br>  <br>  Q. Now that my belly is growing we're having a harder time having sex. Any suggestions?<br>  <br>  A. Be creative! While many people tend to prefer the missionary position for sex during pregnancy, it becomes a very difficult maneuver to perform as the abdomen gets larger. Try some of these positions:<br>  <br>      * Woman on top. This allows you to control the depth of penetration, and the majority of the movement. You can go as fast or as slow as you'd like, while controlling the depth of the penis. This position works really well throughout pregnancy and at the very end of pregnancy.<br>  <br>      * Spooning. This position gets it's name from the way spoons fit together in the silver ware drawer. Usually it's best if the man is behind allowing his penis to go between your thighs and enter you from behind. This creates no pressure on the abdomen, and allows for a shallow penetration. Many women find this a very relaxing position for sex during pregnancy, and it can be used throughout.<br>  <br>      * Hands & Knees. This is a very good position for pregnant women again because of the lack of direct pressure on the abdomen, although as your get larger your belly may actually rest on the bed. Some women find this difficult at the very end of pregnancy, depending on how high they are able to hold their belly off the bed and still allow for penetration.<br>  <br>      * Side lying.

It WILL backfire if he sees it.<br>  <br>  Mary in Camden, MI|`|hWuS3AlLaa	I think you should, he might just need to get his freak on.|`|W0KQTXrvaa	you show him and it will be trouble, you should of thrown it out before|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I would not.<br>  <br>  I don't even know what to suggest at this point.  You're screwed either way.<br>  <br>  Someone e-mailed and asked me why I would say this if hubby wants to watch it and says he's okay with it:  It is based on my personal experience dealing with men.  Men have two categories for women and wives are in one.  Sexual objects are not necessarily in the same one.  And when a wife goes from being an object of respect to a mere sex object, well, I don't see anything great for a marriage coming out of this, personally.  I just think the husband is setting up the marriage for failure, whether he realizes it or not.  jmo<br>  <br>  Please come back and tell us how it went, if you will.|`|3iNobwVraa	Destroy it, then explain that you couldn't handle watching it with him.  Tell him you feel like it could make things weird between you, and you aren't willing to risk your relationship for a cheap thrill.  Tell him you'll be more than happy to act out anything he could ever want in a live show!  Just apologize and tell him you couldn't handle it, it made you feel nervous and weird.|`|01a19d2b8982bebcfca1b5520fa5d1e1aa	Are you nuts !    No .. dont let him see it .<br>  Throw it in the trash.<br>  <br>  How could this possibly benefit your marriage ?<br>  <br>  Would you want to see him have a good ol time with an ex ?<br>  He might like to watch it..and you may feel curious..but it'll be poison later on.  Poison that festers.<br>  <br>  Say you destroyed it because you love him, and he's the only one that matters now.<br>  <br>  If its a VHS tape..go snip it with some scissors so it wont play.|`|AA12367807	You should have thrown it away before you got married.

If you watch it with your husband I advise you to check with your ex if he is prepared to take you back first.<br>  I am sure you husband believes he will be ok with the tape, but also sure he won't be.<br>  Say you destroyed it because the thought of seeing yourself with anyone else will upset you now and past is past.|`|nxeQFPEfaa	WTF does he wanna watch it for???<br>  <br>  There is something terribly strange about that. He should have thrown it away for you. I would never want to see that mess if I were in his position. He is going to watch it anyway, because for some strange reason you STILL have it, so you may as well get some popcorn and get ready for a crazy next few weeks. Because even though he is asking for it, YOU are going to get the WRATH of it from him. You will never live it down.|`|VsqHIoJYaa	i say no not only can it distroy your marraige how would you feel if your ex bf showed this movie to people.  its ashame you didn't throw it away.  i think you need to apoligize to your husbands for not throwing it out but it obviously wasn't something you intended to keep.  tell your husband you would rather make a movie with him. good luck|`|IhvRyyxtaa	To me it sounds like you secretly want him to see it because you really enjoyed making it and are hoping he will be OK with it...but are also secretly thinking that he may not be. <br>  <br>  Why not get a video camera and record a new tape with your husband?|`|97b7d9795e7ae2ee4648b9cbb2fe32a4aa	unfortunetly, your kinda stuck. he knows about it and if you get rid of it. hes gona be mad.  your stuck. just show it to him. maybe it will open it up a bit so you can have that sensation with your husbandd.|`|nDJ9zwZuaa	it leaves me to wonder why your husband wants to see you having sex with some one else|`|5144fbcd1bbb6d5a84af3b01841807d1aa	erase it|`|99d4ebSUaa	You are asking for trouble! It will back fire for sure. <br>  <br>  Next, time if you what to keep the tape take it to you mom house and put in old room or you best friends house, that you trust and that's single.<br>  <br>  If he see you behaving in a way that you have never behaved with him, he will get jealous. Especially he see that another man can make YOU squirt and he didn't. <br>  <br>  Do not show that tape, it is the past and keep it that way!!!<br>  <br>  He has to respect, your privacy. It is none of his business, you were not with him at the time.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|g4mvfBQ8aa	If you know what's good for you and your relationship, you won't show it to him.  He may think he is ready to watch this but you are setting yourself up to fail.  Especially since you climaxed in a way you never have with him.  It may start off as fun and games to him but could flip to where he may feel inadequate as your lover if you don't do some of the same things with him.  That is your past and that is where it needs to stay.  Get rid of it.  Do it regardless if he wants you to or not.  It is not a good idea to watch it.|`|DytsjZKpaa	you should allow for the 2 of you to watch this tape. believe me, it will lead to a lot of better times for the both of you.|`|77d7d84d5a4a1152b83fd0114e664134aa	NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER watch this with him or let him see it.  You are asking for nothing but trouble.  He will say whatever now because he wants to see it, but you will never be able to live this down.  It will definitely bother him immensely and he will never let you forget it and it will probably make him insecure if it is really that good and the ex gives G spot O's. <br>   Now, if you guys have an open relationship or are swingers that would be different.  But if you are a normal couple who dont sleep with other people, I would just somehow "lose" the DVD.  Hide it in a better place, maybe even outside the home
NrEyfsDYaa	Blowing up in his face will not get a confession. Any verbal suspicions you have do no communicate it to him. Get evidence. Don't be like this one dumb girl who keeps harrassing one of my friends by emailing her and lying to her husband like my friend said anything to her. Be Smart. Stay silent, gather your evidence..paper trails, hire a private eye, get pictures, tape converstations, put a low jack in his car. Whatever you do, don't make any moves until you have iron clad irrefutable proof.|`|ee2eb688bade7663b57e940f752dc454aa	You can point blank ask him. However, there's absolutely NO guarantee that he'll tell you the truth.<br>  In my (relatively limited) experience, (most) men don't 'come clean' until presented with irrefutable  evidence (incriminating e-mails, for example, or text messages). And, if you already have the hard evidence, you already know he has been cheating.<br>  In any case, is it possible to sit down with your husband and talk about what marriage means to you both (be sure to listen as well as talk! And don't interrupt or debate...LISTEN)?<br>  Would he be willing to go to a third party (a trained counselor, for example) to help you both with effective communication.<br>  Tell him how you feel when he stays with other women. Ask him how he would feel if you stayed with a 'strange' man you had just met in a club because your ride had abandoned you. (I can't imagine he would be OK with this!)<br>  The 'rule' is: what you don't feel comfortable doing with another in front of your spouse, you shouldn't do. It is inappropriate, disrespects your partner and says little about any integrity in and commitment to the marriage.<br>  If your husband is unwilling to discuss this with you, you may want to rethink your marriage.<br>  Good luck!|`|FeEU1IDOaa	Girl...why do you even WANT a confession???? There's your proof right there! Him staying at an ex's house would have been enough to get him a one-way ticket to divorce court from me!<br>  <br>  First, you can't get him to confess. The ONLY time a guy will ever confess to cheating is if he feels guilty and wants to alleviate himself of that guilt, and that is VERY rare. You need to find some female friend that you trust, that he doesn' tknow, and get her to follow him to a club or wherever he goes, chat him up and get him to confess to HER, then witness for you in court. That's probably the only real way you're going to get any kind of "confession" from him. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OM7tdtx2aa	Regardless of whether he has actually done the deed or not is a little irrelevant right now ... Given the fact that he stayed over at his exes house (What?? No one else's house he could've stayed at in his home town?)<br>  And why the hell is he staying at a strangers house?? Sounds like he picked her up/she picked him up. On thins point, why the hell couldn't he come home that night?? And it sounds like he enjoys time away from you, going out without you... A husband doesn't act like this, so don't let him get away with his actions! <br>  <br>  Has he actually given reasonable explanations for his actions?? <br>  <br>  I think I'd suggest divorce... you deserve better!! Otherwise, maybe a PI could uncover a few things for you ...?<br>  <br>  Hope all works out for you :)|`|FvDsMku4aa	Put yourself in his shoes, will you admit that you cheated if you did? I am sure you will deny it  unless proven. Be tactful when handling such situations. Stay cool and calm and slowly piece by piece will surface. But I am sorry to say that judging from your questions, I think you must as well be prepared to find out later that he did cheat.|`|97b7d9795e7ae2ee4648b9cbb2fe32a4aa	&& hes still your husband because....?<br>  <br>  <br>  because hes having his cake && eating it too.<br>  grow some balls and file for divorce..|`|th7C1aoaaa	ask him.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	yeah, we already heard and responded to this one before.  get over it.|`|yBBjTVQaaa	Wear him down i guess.

The truth will sound like bullshit as will his lies.  I'd confront him about it while packing his things.  Good luck.|`|naequcqlaa	No husband stays w/an ex, stays w/a complete stranger while out of town.  This is just not what married men do, you have EVERY rite to question his actions.  They are far from being "normal".  How does he expect you to believe he's been doing these things & NOT cheating on you.  This is totally absurd & unbelievable!  Would he actually expect to believe you IF you did the things he's doing to you?  Does he think you're a total idiot for even thinking he's not doing things on the up & up!  He has some "talking" to do, some "admitting" to you.  Let him know you are NOT going to accept the unacceptable.  You have absolutely NO reason to do it.  Tell him to start talking, you're listening, & it had better be the truth & nothing but...Good luck to you...:)|`|2YX18RE2aa	Really, why does it matter if he confesses?<br>  <br>  Act on appearances and go from there. <br>  That's what you are doing so have at it.<br>  <br>  If he won't confess he either,<br>  A. Did nothing wrong.<br>  B. Does not think he did anything wrong.<br>  C. Did everything wrong and is trying to avoid the consequence.<br>  <br>  Your choices are believe him or do not believe him.<br>  Your choice.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	Most cheaters will deny everything and never own up to the truth even when faced with proof.<br>  <br>  Trust your gut feeling.

Durring Saturday just call her up and ask her if she's doing anything Sunday.  Then she can't say she forgot.  <br>  Good luck|`|tzxNppCyaa	that's very simple. she is taking you for granted. If she's aware of the fact that she has a boyfriend, she would never forget to call you and stuff like that. it shows lack of interest. You guys are going out for 2 weeks and that's how she's acting, man that's a major problem. might as well leave her before things get worst. Good luck baby|`|2OyAJxcFaa	well...you should call her or email her that you need to talk to her about something important...then ask her if ya can meet up somewhere, and talk to her about how you feel...but when you talk to her talk to her straight up...depending on how that gose make your choice|`|tpnVVRceaa	WHAT :O you only say her 3 times and you have been going out with her for 2 weeks?

I'm a little concerned about your desire to 'make' her love you in return and how to be more exciting than her ex.  <br>  <br>  Since you are best friends, she probably knows you very well.  Making yourself into a different person in order to appeal to her sense of adventure or excitement is probably not going to bring a lot of success -- she would probably see through it rather quickly.<br>  <br>  I notice that you haven't talked about one of the easiest ways to find out or encourage her attention to you in a romantic way - TELLING her how you feel about her.  Look for the right moment, give yourself a plan for regrouping if she says she's not interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with you, and let her feelings guide your choices.<br>  <br>  Trying to 'make' anyone else like us by being someone we are not is not a good use of energy.  At some point, you can't keep up the appearance and you'll return to your old habits or personality.  Why not let her love you (or only like you) for who you really are?|`|urQnRQ4jaa	ask her out dude!!! And if she is your best friend like you say tell her how you feel!!! hope that helps...|`|gUhQ3N3Iaa	well , since she have kissed you , she must have some feelings about u<br>  try to tell her how u really feel about her , if that was hard for u , try showing to her that u like her , maybe by getting her roses , chocolate or something<br>  try telling her to get over that guy like by saying : i know another guy who really likes u ;) and he happens to be ur bff !<br>  that way she will understand you<br>  <br>  hope i helped <br>  marah :)|`|Waiiu3s4aa	Start doing things..that take you out of the "friend" category.  When she feels down, instead of letting her talk all day about her ex to you, buy her some flower's instead and invite her to dinner.  Take small steps and eventually, you will no longer be looked at as the "friend".|`|ksvl0bWWaa	When you tell her explain very carefully|`|0c2jew2xaa	Ok... what you have to do is hang out with her more often. Don't try to compete with her ex cause that won't really help. Try to act nice around her and act like friends. Invite her to dinner and just talk like friends. Eventually what will happen is that she'll get a lot of feelings towards you.|`|14PkXbTDaa	Don't change who you are to impress someone.  Especially if you believe she has feelings for you already.  Just being there for her and helping her through hard times is a good start.  If you really must know then ask her how she really feels about you, and answer with what you really think about her.  Hopefully everything works out for you!!|`|8yGLf3Byaa	well, from what the above post said about, telling her, DONT never tell a girl how you feel, show her, make like a date nothing romantic or anything just a chill date, make some moves, tell her some past stories of exciting times, and if you dont have any, then get out more, show that your the exciting guy, that everyone should know about<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Alg23rh0vurcXE0i8_12R4zsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307145217AAUufI3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|RNdowYxeaa	oh this happened to me!! except i was in the girls position.

URZNtrxsaa	Good Question Sky!! I grew up in the city and we use to ride bikes, roller skate (with old metal skates), played with toys, swim and play sports as we got older. In the winter, we would Ice Skate, play hockey, sled or toboggan and read.

t7S4vU7Qaa	Of course, nobody is perfect. I think the problem really is with your mom and the fact that you don't want this problem to affect your social life (seeing that you don't want a counselor nor want to talk it with friends).<br>  is your mom schizophrenic? I guess all that you can really do is to keep away from her when she has her mood swing. Avoid her. And be gentle on yourself, don't believe what she says when she is in a bad mood. <br>  you also need at least someone who would be willing to listen to you. You need someone to whom you just talk it all off. Someone maybe that you do not know you personally. <br>  just be good, avoid her. <br>  and f*** the fake bitches(?)<br>  <br>  enjoy life!|`|QlXhPFSwaa	well i want you to know that it is not YOU that needs help but rather it is your mom. she is just not depressed but a wacko. i am glad my parents are not like that. except for that one instance when i was like 7(i think). my mom beat me and i got welts from that broom she hit me so hard with all over my body but she only did it once but i think i need a psychiatrist for that. she actually asked me when i was older if she ever beat me and i said for sure i even got welts from that. she told me to beat her up now. in my mind  i was like "WTF? what for?" damage has been done. cant believe she forgot that she did that to me. another proof that she really does not care about me...<br>  <br>  anyway enough of my childhood trauma. what im saying is. perhaps you be the adult in this situation then. if you love your mom, just try to understand her. in my case my parents has never cussed us or we never hear them utter those words. i actually learned cuss words when i went to school.<br>  <br>  i repeat.it is not YOU that needs help , it is your mom. if she tries to go psycho on you the next time. just turn your back on her. or just say... "i am tired of this non sense. i love you but..

Well, all i can say is, you have to take it in. my mom and i used to fight alot as well. I then learnt that this fighting will go no where, so i decided i would take it in. Everytime she scolds me, i'll just keep quiet, not ignoring, but keeping quiet. This might simmer the situation down a bit. And sometimes, even when you're both angry, try to crack jokes. Try to go into positions that do not allow either of you to start an argument, and if you are in the wrong, put your ego down and apologize. <br>  <br>  <br>  Also please don't kill yourself, of run away from home. that will not solve the problem, only heighten it by making your mom think that you really are a loser for running away from your problems. you have to try to make it into a comfortable situation everytime you all start to fight okay. <br>  <br>  I wish the best for you!

XE1OKdOOaa	Face with your fears.I think you're quite scared about talking to girls face to face.Think about this things:why via msn you are more confidential;'cause you have more time to think what you'll say,or 'cause you can pretend to be who ever you want to? <br>  Well,better silence than rubbish.Everything isn't lost still,you probably seem mysterious and interesting to them,'cause they don't know what are you thinking about...guys like that are always the most attractive to me personally,because I wanna find out what's happening in their heads...Sincerely,real disappointment comes when I find out there's nothing there...don't let that happen!Practice in front of mirror,ask your friends about some good jokes(but better avoid them if you don't know how-you'll make a fool of yourself),smell nice,be cool and relaxed and don't forget-girls don't bite! <br>  And no one is going to hate you even if you make a mistake(hey,we're all people,and life goes on...) <br>  Remember:Girls love to be admired...(just don't go too far...) <br>  Think positive,be yourself,life is one,so don't take them too serious and have fun...you'll meet plenty of girls in your life...consider these practice:-) <br>  Good luck,hope I helped:-)))|`|6febee8b4757d9cd4857176f7b29c818aa	Girls are human beings just like you, gender wise, no, but as a person, yes.

So without talking to them in person, how will they find out about your personality?<br>  Maybe you could try practicing with girls you talk to regularly over msn, ask them if you can call them. Call the one you feel most comfortable with and just work on talking over the phone first.|`|6Rru2901aa	if you're not capable of talking to them in person, perhaps you're not really being yourself when you're on msn in first place. perhaps you have an alter ego who comes out while you're talking to girls online.

But seriously...do NOT try to be funny if you have not had a previous record for being funny...because then it's just embarrassing and is a MASSIVE turn off. If you're not funny then don't even go there, just act normal and laugh at other people's jokes but try not to crack one. <br>  If there's a girl you have in mind, talk to her, but not so much so that she finds you annoying. Talk to her a bit and wait until she starts conversations with you (that is a key sign) <br>  Girls don't really like it that much if you constantly act like a big idiot, like sometimes it funny if you don't get something right away cause it can be 'cute' but if you're ACTUALLY dumb then...try to get smarter. Girls don't like it if you act smarter than them but they also don't like it if you can't help them with anything at all.

Hj5LZSUUaa	i went through something like this with my current bf [of nearly 10 months] b4 we got together, we would flirt and  we would kinda give hints about liking eachother. but wouldnt admit it, so this went on 4 a while. thennn one night..... he's talking to this girl on AIM and she tells him she likes him. and he says he likes her too so he asked her out. [byyyy the way, he had never met this girl, she lived 45 minutes away, and had only known her for a month] so he told me about it the next morning and i was completely crushed.... and he would tell me how much he loved her and stuff. and so i tried to act as if i didnt care and i would tell him that im happy for him. and he would always ask me why im not as happy as i was anymore. and i would just make up stuff. and they went out for about a month. and while he was with her he wrote me this poem [he always writes them] about how much he still loved me and how he made a mistake and stuff. and he broke up with his gf and we're still together. aha<br>  <br>  soo i say let it be for a little while and see what happens. send him little hints that you still have feelings for him. hope i helped :P|`|498JdszFaa	I'd say the last: leave them alone and get on with your life.

How do you know he's not just waiting for you? Maybe he doesn't think you like him, so he's trying to move on. If he doesn't feel the same way back, then there would be nothing lost, right? It's up to you.|`|aVgaBK15aa	no, i think you should forget him.<br>  he was obviously telling you how much he likes his girlfriend because he is trying to hint he's not interested in you anymore, because if he knows you like him he wouldnt say that to him, so i think he's quite nasty.<br>  you should stop waiting on something that might not ever happen, and find a better guy who will treat you properly<br>  :)<br>  good luck!<br>  ox|`|Zc0sDaK1aa	He could be trying to make you jealous. Tell him to quit talking to you about her and see what he does. He might just be waiting for you to flip, and if he's not, at least that way you won't have to hear him talk about it all the time.|`|2zKBJkM8aa	Tell him how you feel in a calm and mature manner.  If he still wants to be with his girlfriend, then the matter is closed and you move on.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	in the end, saying your not ready for a relationship is a BIG sign.<br>  <br>  i didnt want a relationship when i first gotto college, and i met a guy, and that just went away.  when you find somone and they really are perfect, you have to be with them...theres no "i shouldnt be in a realtionship, im not ready now..."<br>  <br>  i say often, that i met the man of my dreams too early, an i would have enjoyed a few more years of freedom, but meeting somone young has its ups too.<br>  <br>  anyway, i would tell him thast you care abotu him, and express that you hope to remain friends, but that it hurts you when he talks abotu his gf, andthat you wish that hed stop.  <br>  <br>  past that, move on.  if he wanted to be with you, he would have been, and he wouldnt have been with a different girl.  its plain and simple.<br>  <br>  good luck, take care of yourself, and you will find somone that wants to be with you...|`|MuIndhLXaa	forget him... i understand how hard that would be but if he said he wanted to be with you and is now stringing u along as u said then there is no reason 2 be with him. u need to find someone that wont lead u on and really wants to be with u. u arnt being an a***** by wanting to be with him. its him not u (: hope this helps u!|`|lJTodKayaa	i say you should tell him because i bet he just is trying to go out with you sooner so once you tell him he'll probably break up with her and go out with you. or you could just roll with it and wait for them to break up then make your move|`|ILyrLkX2aa	Yeah, I'd say you should try to get over your feelings for this kid. He's not into you like that obviously, because if he was he would be with you and not her. Maybe he just likes having you around as a little toy or something. I mean, haven't you ever been liked by a guy that you weren't really into but the attention from him was kind of fun or pleasing or something so you kind of kept them around? No? <br>  <br>  In any case, I don't think you will ever be in a relationship with this kid and even if you do it probably won't last. Maybe you can stay his friend if that's what you want, but you might want to try to move on to avoid any further unnecessary pain.

Did you just take it quietly? <br>  But knowing that he loves you (and her) and that he is a good guy, what do you really think about the spankings he has given you?  Of course you didn't like them at the time!!<br>  <br>  >my seven year old little sister was bad during the sermon. <br>  <br>  Why?  How?

I have known a dad with young sons; one of them got restless during Church, dad would take him out give him perhaps 2 or 3 smacks, hand on backside, then they would soon return. It didn't take long for son to realize he'd prefer sitting in Church without the short break.<br>  <br>  >Kristen told him to shut up.<br>  <br>  Wouldn't that earn most children a "spanking", maybe more so than for being "bad" in church?

It's supposed to hurt.   He doesn't sound mean. You just don't agree with his displinary skills..
bdeymNvHaa	Hopefully you're not in California.  They have a very warped sense of justice there.  They like to give fathers custody because the mothers don't give up on their children, like many fathers do.  The fathers use this as a way to hurt the kids' mothers and to avoid paying child support.  My children suffered irreparable damage at the hands of my ex-, his family, and his girlfriend/wife and there was nothing I could do to help them.<br>  <br>  My ex- would go to court, say he just got an attorney and needed a continuance, then use these sorts of tactics to avoid getting any kind of resolution.  His check would bounce, the atty would drop him, he'd show up in court saying he needed time to find another attorney - it went on for 18 months and the courts just let it happen.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you find an attorney you can trust and who won't rip you off like 2 of mine did.  <br>  <br>  Regarding the girlfriend, keep a recording device handy and let her see it when you two are talking.  Tell her she's being recorded and the tape can be used in court as evidence.  Some states will still allow recordings to be used as long as one party (you) are aware you are being recorded.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	Yes you should get a lawyer.  Maybe if you had continued with visitation he wouldn't be taking you to court.  Get a hand held tape recorder, any time you are around his girlfriend have it handy, while you can't use it in court, it may make her behave if she knows  you are recording her insults.<br>  <br>  You know, she's probably the one pushing him for joint custody. Talk to your lawyer.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you. If you want a really weird idea email me through my profile, just remind me of your situation.|`|p9m0yAYHaa	Get a lawyer. You might be able to agree that his girlfriend cannot be in the house while he is visiting your daughter however he might also be able to say that your boyfriend cannot be in the house if he has joint custody. Also you are not allowed to stop visitation without a court order. He can use this against you as not following the order unless he has been shown to be physically, emotional, or verbal abusive towards your daughter.
EDXh0tk9aa	There is nothing you can do, other than ignore them.  Select your friends wisely.|`|FeEU1IDOaa	Well, ARE you a bully? I know you don't want people talking about you, but maybe you should take a closer look at the way you treat people. Maybe you could ask Perry if people have been saying you're a bully, and ask him to tell the truth, promise him that you won't go nuts or start a bunch of drama; ect. And ask him WHY people have been saying that. Sometimes people don't realize how they treat others until someone actually tells them. <br>  <br>  Also, if you've done anything to hurt these girls I suggest you try to make it right with them. That way you can ask them to take down those web sites and they'll be more likely to say yes.|`|l1UwQRBTaa	Sounds absolutely mental, you need to have a word with this girl and see why she has done it.|`|D20JGTwXaa	umm u shud report her to the police ...se has problems.

SwNDuQadaa	I am not going to read all of that!|`|QP8LdPLeaa	dude that was TOOOO much to read, but i read it anyway.<br>  <br>  overall i think you are a GREAT, G-R-E-A-T guy. and i think its girlfriends like yours that put men down who are emotional and make fun of them. to me guys who are sensitive are worth my time because that lets me know they have feelings and are not so macho to hide them. i don't think you should be speaking to either of them. the woman lied to your girlfriend and your girlfriend has been messing around with her ex, KNOWING it was going to hurt you or bother you. why would ANY girlfriend on the face of this earth NOT care or CAN"T see the problem in going to her ex boyfriend's house? she's STUPID dude. she's controlling you and you're letting her. i would have broken up with her.<br>  <br>  go back and read that whole thing and give me one good reason Why you should stay with her? because i don't, she seems very snobbish. second, she can't tell you who you can't and can be friends with. as long as its not interfering with your feelings for your girlfriend.|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	Did you say, "briefly"?|`|e1c7a6271ad6e2c76bcc9db56e32540baa	Grow up.  Ex is a problem but so are you.|`|84b2777cc69c41b43d99c853cd3c3469aa	Sounds like you've been through a lot with her so there's one simple question to ask yourself... "Can I stay in this relationship and be happy?' It sounds like girlfriend plays too many games and is not mature enough for a relationship with a guy like you. Maybe sit down and write a list of positive and negative reasons to stay in this relationship. If the positives outweigh the negatives then stay. If the negatives outweigh the positives then send girlie on her way. It really sounds like you have a better connection with other woman you started talking to so you may want to think about whether or not you want to pursue anything with her. Good luck to you man!|`|pWoMaxwkaa	I'm not going to attempt to read your novel.<br>  But I will answer the question , she feels insecure about herself and thinks that you are capable of cheating and can get any woman you want. I think you should try breaking that ice and tell her that shes beautiful and make her feel that she can get any man of her dreams. Maybe have one of your most trustworthy bad looking male friends hang out with her and talk to her.|`|s5y6SZhnaa	are you trying to debate open borders to mexico? no? then freaking SUMMARIZE!|`|OhYE3GhKaa	your gf didn't want you. she just didn't want anyone else to have you|`|1zfwLsQpaa	Holy Sh!t that is long...<br>  <br>  I think you just need to either talk with her and tell her that you deserve to talk to other girls that are simply friends just as she could with guys. I think she is just being selfish. But make sure that when you are with her you make her feel special and you can tell "yeah that's his girl". If she says no, dump her.|`|6Rru2901aa	LOL, and this you say is the short version? Damn I know at times ppl don't give us enough details, but this is too long, and I'm not going to read it. <br>  <br>  Giving an advice just by reading the tittle, as long as you're not doing anything withe other girl all you have to do is give your girlfriend the respect she deserves and try to make her feel confident that she has nothing to worry about you being with other girls.|`|BjS8k8Cyaa	Ranting is illegal on Yahoo Answers. I would REPORT you but you seem like a nice guy who took a lot of time to write this and is obviously troubled so I will let you off, poor guy.<br>  But next time if I see you ranting I will report you so keep on your toes mate.<br>  Question details from 5-10 lines is reasonable k? <br>  Good luck with your girl issue mate|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	Ok wow, I feel that if someone has a serious problem, they deserve a serious answer.<br>  <br>  <br>  It sounds like things were already on the rocks between your girlfriend and yourself. You must understand that her fear of you talking to other women is due to her insecurity that you will find love in someone else and leave her. Her fear stems from her deep care for you, so do not get that wrong. However, it is through the wrong median that she is trying to show her care towards you. She is being very protective and jealous, while you see no problem in doing this. I think that your girlfriend now is demanding your feelings, rather than you feeling them. It seems that she wants to control your every move, and because of this you are not happy at all, which explains why you've already felt like breaking up with her. She is playing games with you, trying to evoke the same feelings she feels for you, jealousy. With the whole ex boyfriend thing, she just wanted to get a reaction out of you because she knows you are a strong person but you never show that sort of protectfulness that she shows you.<br>  <br>  In all, I think that this whole thing is pretty unhealthy for the soul. I have not been in a situation even close to this and hope I never do. If your family is even unsure whether you should stay, you should not take my or anyone elses answer in total completeness. Nobody knows how you truly feel inside, we can only observe from a far and add our opinions. I think that if it is causing you deep grief, and you dread seeing her than you should just leave and live.|`|hoWFYhwKaa	Your gf sounds seriously mentally unstable. She tried to commit suicide for goodness sake. She went back to her x to be spiteful then has the nerve to invade your privacy on skype and tells you u cannot talk to another woman when she is obviously screwing her x out of spite. Really, think about it. Do u honestly want to spend THE REST OF YOUR LIFE with this crazy girl. She may try to kill u in your sleep or something or chop off your penis like lorena bobbitt. This girl has some serious issues. I think you had a much better connection with the other girl and would be alot happier with the other girl. Get rid of psycho and move on with your life.|`|z67BUETnaa	wow! so from what it sounds like, neither of these girls are really healthy for you-i think it's time for you to move on. tell them you're done-there are plenty more girls out there and you deserve better. or even be single for awhile. theres nothing wrong with that.|`|RzBaoGw4aa	Don't be women handled<br>  Put her back in her place and tell that b!7ch that you control the relationship...|`|ILyrLkX2aa	That is a ridiculous request.<br>  She doesn't want you to talk to another woman?<br>  She sounds jealous and controlling, neither of which are desirable traits, especially if the relationship is long-term.<br>  I'd say you should have a talk with her and tell her it's not right for her to request something as silly as this from you. We all have our insecurities, but that doesn't give her the right to dictate how you live your life.<br>  <br>  Would you ask something like this from her?<br>  It doesn't sound like a healthy relationship, you might want to consider getting out.|`|RStOQvSWaa	oh dam dude lol so much to read. i didnt read but i know this. if your GF doesnt want you talking to another girl that means he knows you talk to lots of girls and doesnt want you getting the idea of leaving her for another girl. just tell your GF that the girls you hang out with are just FRIENDS and nothing more.|`|XIT7B3xnaa	Ummmmm DNAGGG. I just read a little bit of it and i was like. well if hes wiling to write all of this about her than obviosly he cares about her. Dude dont waste yourtime just writting about her. I mean just go talk to her. If she says she dosent wana listen, then just raise you viocce a little, grab her attention. and after u guys talk it out, and she still wants 2 be a grumpy person, tell her to take a hike. u tride. or get a relation ship councler, if she agreas. Just let her know how much ya care about her. YOU BOTH r the problem.|`|kVPscU5Jaa	okay...dats freakin' long!!!<br>  <br>  well tell her shes the only one in yourlife,and dat if she doesnt trust u.....who will.(look into her eyes and say)"plus,there is no other girl in this world that has glittery,crystal eyes like you."<br>  "ive never loved a beautiful girl,as much as i love u".<br>  "the ONLY GIRL i care about is u,the rest r jst friends.....u.......r my girlfriend...thats a WHOLE NEW WORLD".
i9nlUZb0aa	Tell them the truth. Tell them that you need to talk to them and you need them to sit down and not say a word until your done. Then let them know that this teacher is a good man and that you admire him. That he is always there for all the kids. Not just as a teacher but as a friend. And that if not for him and his encouragement you would not be doing so well in school. That it is him that helps you and listens to you. And that he is not a molester he's just a caring teacher who loves kids and wants to see them do well. He should be recommended for the teacher apple award. Then let them no the truth that he doesn't call the kids that its you kids that call him. And that whatever punishment they want to give is fine but to please not blame the teacher for being a good person and to at least talk to him before they judge him. Good-luck|`|L2AWPUVXaa	you are going to get him fired!! tell your parents the truth, and face the consequences alright! and if you really want to talk to that teacher you can email him, or MSN with him, its free!|`|lvzlpjl2aa	you can't do that. it shows the bill payer the phone records.just tell them the truth.. you can get this guy in a lot of trouble. it's not normal.|`|jrcBgCxeaa	Hate to break it to you, but you are caught....<br>  All calls show up on bills time and number....so.....the jig is up.<br>  Secondly a cell phone should be used as a tool, if you were given it, it should only be used for emergencies or to call your parents as to let them know where you are. Lastly you broke trust with your parents..they told you not to do this and you did it anyways....<br>  Sorry the best thing to do is take your lumps......|`|f4126b0baa297b82a91a07ad7af89bd0aa	Not that I thinks its a good thing that u are talking to an older teacher, does not seem right, and he should not have that kind of relationship w/ his students, not at the age u are at. <br>  <br>  But if u want to talk to him, u need to get a phone card or something like that, ur parents are upset at the fact u are using up hte minutes w/ out even considering how much its costing them...and in economical times like these ever cent counts <br>  <br>  there is also Skype.com its an online phone, u could call him from your computer, u just need a headset<br>  <br>  I still don't approve of the idea of u talking to an older man like u do, and I am sure your parents will flip out and get this man fired if they found out.. so i think in his and your best interest, you should start to calm down those phone calls|`|t7S4vU7Qaa	That is quite a mess you got there. Seeing that you can connect to the net, why not just call your teacher thru the net, thru YM. or you could get a fixed rate for net surfing on phone and install nimbuzz so that you can make calls for free.<br>  <br>  Gosh, for now just do the crying stuff. I think it wold work for your parents for now. ok?<br>  <br>  Be good, don't let your parents worry about you so much!|`|ecbb8885dceda8d096f5e8eb4efe2af4aa	There is no good reason why a teacher should be keeping in touch with a 12 year old, and if his boses knew this , he could be fired. You should tell your parents the truth, because if it ever comes out, then they will never believe anything you say.|`|JNY4BEASaa	wow you need a life get a bf or a good friend

hLozB0MUaa	ummmmm she's busy? wow, u guys think things thru way too much... it's prolly something simple like she didn't know the number or was busy, or had her fone off..... settle ok?|`|GR8jl7vZaa	Well she might not have turned on her cell yet.....that happend to me...this guy texted me yesterday but i didn't get it until just now 'cause i didn't have my phone on.|`|a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	I miss text messages soooo often! She may have not even gotten it. Don't be in a rush to judge|`|d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	this most likely means that she forgot to charge the phones battery and is dead now.  Other than that it might mean she is ignoring you. Happens all the time to me with my women, they are always forgetting to charge the phones  up
9BsyKN9haa	WHAT? My husband would KNOW if I had a gun! That is the worst excuse I have ever heard! UNLESS she plans on shooting you someday.... good luck dude! <br>  <br>  Oh yeah, I would make sure all your family KNOWS your wife has a gun and didn't tell you...|`|v8lSuNQzaa	I don't, but why in the heck would you do that to her? I would have hurt you with my bare hands.|`|AA11969451	No, I do not own a firearm that my husband doesn't know about and if I did I wouldn't carry it around in public.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	I don't live in Compton I don't need a weapon, ever.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Good god no!  It's illegal to carry a gun in England.
bcea9e0597ee026b8f88013b95d84be3aa	Don't play into that. You're not in a contest for your mother-in-law's affection. Let the relationship between Sandy and your mother-in-law run it's course and you continue to be yourself. You're a great girl!|`|NQwljNOoaa	I had a mother in law just like that.  You need to just let her go.  She is a shallow person and will never be anything but shallow.  Why would you want to be part of that.  My mother in law not only did to me what yours is doing to you, she would tell me and my husband that she liked us better because no one comes around unless they want something except us and we never asked her for anything.  Then when she died, she left my husband (who is one of six) and three other siblings out of the will on purpose and only acknowledged the two favorites (of which we obviously weren't).  My husband felt so unloved because of the fact that we treated her better and it felt to him as if his mother kicked him in the gut (his words).  He said after he picked his heart up off the floor, he told every one of his siblings (both parents are dead now) that the funeral was the last they would see of us (we live out of town but not too far).  No one had in the past bothered to come see us much, so my husband pretty much washed his hands of them all.  I suggest you stand back, because it sounds like your husband may go through something similar and he will need your support.  Good luck!|`|3NoQuoWuaa	You don't owe mother in law anything. Consider getting another baby sitter. It is probably best you do. Stay as far away from mother and sister in law as you can, but to their face be sweet. Do not bad mouth either of them to your husband. He has to get along with family and you do to when it is unavoidable. Your self esteem is important and you don't need to sacrifice it for them.r.

What could it hurt to see if he likes you. I know htat in the 8th grade it is hard to tell someone you like them (and trust me it does not get any easier, it took me over 5 months to tell my husband that I thought he was datable.) But what could it hurt to say, Hey I think your cute and I would like to catch a movie with you!|`|JjS4ARPYaa	I think he knows you like him (or assumes it) and he likes you to.|`|aVgaBK15aa	aww, he definately did that on purpose :)<br>  sweet lol. i tihnk he probaby likes you<br>  xo|`|UfmxdEFkaa	AWW thats so juvenile and cute.<br>  When I was in 6th grade that happened to me and we KNEW our hands we touching and the next month he asked out my best friend.<br>  <br>  He probably didn't say anything because he doesn't like you and just wants to be friends.|`|0deec76c1f446c59ff2a003764245ad3aa	if a girl says sorry when your leg touches hers<br>  or her hand touches yours<br>  its pretty much says in a guys head "crap, she thinks that was an accident, and she doesnt feel close enough to me because she just apologized"|`|Jhr68T0baa	Chill out! He probaly didnt even notice. Its not a big deal. he probaly isnt even thinking anything of it.|`|fBqenlcbaa	I'm in 8th grade too.  <br>  I know it seems like an awkward moment, but it should be an exciting one for you. <br>  He likes you.|`|34RxkN6eaa	you're in 8th grade stop worrying about it. next time one up him and grab his junk...he'll know you did that on purpose|`|f2129bc33b7957a77b67647b1f8d266baa	Talk to him.<br>  <br>  Go out on  date or something.|`|4gyOqTqGaa	wooooow<br>  <br>  thats a 9 on the awkward scale|`|RtBKHxQDaa	8th grade....wow im in da 8th grade too...omg dsa memories to tell u something even more awkward than that well me and my crush had to work on something for our teacher all day midsing clas.. da good part, datz cus were da rtists in da class. and da two other girls with us left to go to an impirtant clas cuz dey had to and i kno he like me he said so but he still had a gf at da time, and we strted havvin a play fight with a roll of huge paper, he kept hiitng my hed or my butt or anywhere on purpose, he dropped da role of tape on purpose and his nasty mind wa like bend ove so he could stand right behind me and i was like u kno wat no....more stuff happened i'm just skippin and onatha was dat he was layin on da floor and i was siti down on da flor net to him and i was tryin to make his lazii *** write sumthin but he took the pencil and strted poking my knee with it and i was wearing a skirt {part of da uniform} and he strted goin up my skirt wit da pencil and it wa s a mechanical pensil so it actualli poked through my clothes and omg he was turnin me on, but i had to hold it in i was like stop dat hurts but mad softly and in a flirty way, which made him do it more and omfg dat conv afta school on aim was mad crazii..lolz  so itz da 8th grade awkwardness is a part of it go along with it dont worry to much....make memories cuz dis da year to rememba|`|b75f927c9f10fa43476cc2ab92b409e0aa	He probably enjoyed the moment.  People can say a lot with their eyes.<br>  Guys sometimes find it hard to find the right words.  Articulating a feeling isn't always easy.  He may very well feel the same way you do but sharing unfamiliar feelings can be scary with someone you don't know very well.  Try to find out what interests him and get him to talk about that.  If it doesn't work out then at least you will have a new friend.|`|TmPiF9hcaa	guys sometimes find it hard to show there emotions so he was probly just as embarresed as you were id go for it and ask him out/ :)|`|pUhOkFAJaa	Maybe he's shy.|`|5ekbXw9saa	How cute! He did it on purpose!|`|e3Yg5DCBaa	the best thing to do is ask him. it probably got him thinking as much as you are. or be brave and ask him out
y9UyAe2waa	reminds me of my ex, natalie, shes a ***** now tho!|`|AA10471659	Do you know some girls you do talk to that also have no trouble talking to guy's?   Use one or two of them to get the door opened up so you can talk to some guys. You have a big heart, and you just have to show people who you really are. Girls can conspire to get a guy talking and they do a little she (you) likes that kind of thing too, don't you.  You have the advantage over guys as you are more mature than them, Use all  the ways you can to get what you want. You really shouldn't have any problem talking with guys, with a little practise.|`|N2BAdOXEaa	Sounds like a keeper for sure. But guys are not interested in a serious lasting relationship don't go for these type of girls, most of the time. The guys that do, usually are shy and it is very hard sometimes to get two shy people together in a relationship. You should work on making the first move, have a guy go to a movie with you. Not much pressure for first date, don't have to talk much or anything. If you really like him, reach for his hand and hold it. He should get the message somewhere threw the movie. Good luck with your choices.|`|KiYWJDDKaa	she needs to start talking to girls a bit more so even if they are not intrested in you, you will get some parctice talking to guys who hang out with your friends.  also on mondays wear bright clothes that make you stand out so that way guys have something to say and can compliment you to make you feel nice.<br>  <br>  *can i get the ten points*|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	I think she is porbably a good person.  The athleticism is a PLUS.|`|rnMZHdCraa	And what are the negatives, don't say she doesn't have any. <br>  because everybody has their faults.|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	I think your normal, The right guy will notice you in due time. You are special.|`|4Lzf3wenaa	You sound like a great person, or this girl.  Try to be more confident.  I have the same shy, lack of confidence issue.  Guys at school will love you, I"m sure.  I know I would.  Good Luck!  I'm sorry, I mean the tirl that you know, I keep referring to you, sorry.|`|34RxkN6eaa	having low confidence is not attractive...start thinking you're better than everyone that should help haha. most guys are concerned with very few things you just listed up there.  we like funny, attractive chicks mostly|`|6Rru2901aa	She's posting questions like these on Yahoo! answers and it's a big turn off in guys! Get some confidence!<br>  <br>  Good luck, <br>  <br>  Moe.|`|f2129bc33b7957a77b67647b1f8d266baa	You need to build up your self esteem and stop worrying so much about what other people think about you.<br>  <br>  Focus on what you think of yourself.|`|RStOQvSWaa	umm thats fine its just she needs to learn to start talking to other people and not just wait for somebody to come up and talk to her. doesnt work that way sorry :/|`|s6itMDRTaa	she might need to be a bit more open <br>  if she's smart she won't make dumb mistakes and be smart about who she sees|`|5ekbXw9saa	Confidence is what makes a girl sexy! Wait for a group of your friends 2 be talking to some guys then join in(:|`|JjS4ARPYaa	She has to talk and build up her self of stem and confidence.|`|2NmS09yVaa	Ive talked to girls like her and they end up thinking that I like them more than a friend cuz I'm socializing with them, they aren't used to guys talking to them so they get it twisted. It just annoys me bcuz I dont want them to get the wrong idea, Im just tryin to make friends not a relationship.<br>  <br>  She needs to try starting conversations more with guys or girls and slowly build up her confidence that way.|`|wCOySYL2aa	She should really talk to the people that are trustworthy, because if she starts talking to everybody to become "popular" she just might get hurt down the road, and being a freshman rumors will spread quick as warm butter.|`|WIpohuihaa	have more confidence and open up more with other people. That would be a start. These guys that are just messing with her are probably not worth her while anyway. If they can't see her for who she is then she should associate with others|`|TmPiF9hcaa	she sounds like a really sweet and genuine person but she cant always leave it up the guy maybe if she got more confidence and spoke to more guys she would blossom .#<br>  i hope she finds someone :)|`|VKGnX0Lvaa	I think it is very important that this girl have confidence!

A8wS807daa	dude... don't you'd think she would realize that you sacrificed your friendship with the other girls so that you two could become better friends?<br>  <br>  also... if she was that much of a friend she wouldn't just ditch you... and if she does then she wasn't much of a friend in the first place.<br>  <br>  =]|`|rEUI5sVvaa	Honey, a real friend would understand the situation and it's just like a situation I went through a few years ago, I was cheated on by a very serious boyfriend and when I got with my fiancee' he once thought  was cheating on him (which wasn't true in any shape or form) and it's kinda like this...."Don't do something to someone that you wouldn't want done to you" I know it sounds old and mother-like but as they also say "mother knows best." After being hurt that bad, I would never want anyone to feel the way I felt when I was cheated on, so therefore I would never cheat on someone. Just be honest with her, I know you two are young, but as you grow up you'll find out who your true friends are and who the fake's are, I hope this helps =)|`|XKoVjG2kaa	well i am also 14 and i understand wat you mean it's hard to have  really good friend and loose them for some other friends so the best thing i think you should do is to talk to her and tell her that you wanna stay friends with her and your scared that she will ignore you and not talk to you anymore if she goes back with them but that's  her choice on if she wants to go back with them or not and you did the right thing by letting her hang out with you so first i think y'all shouldd talk then i think if she wants to go hang back out with them then you should try to become friends with her friends so all of y'all can hang out .
tU5NJVL3aa	Well, 1) it's not a NEW stereotype, and 2) maybe it's because black men don't buy into the ridiculous "6 foot tall and skinny as a fencepost" stereotype that the advertising world has foisted on everyone.  A little "cushin' for the pushin' " makes for lots more fun.  I'll also let you in on a little secret:  the girls with just a little more meat on them are for the most part healthier than the starved emaciated ones.|`|2tn8EALqaa	Racists saying it to make themselves feel better...<br>  <br>  <br>  haha, the last question I answered was actually saying that fat white women get hit on "nonstop" by black dudes<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: I can't help but notice that few people actually answer the question.

d99c36d5f56f277ffb1672213daabd95aa	Most definitely, even if you feel scared to, ackward, if you don't you will always wish and regret that you never had, As for dating her, etc. she can only say yes or no, and if so, yu've known that, that's why you never anneciated before a long time ago, it's never to late, the good thing though, is you willl still be friends and friendship can last a lifetime, even after one has moved, memories are shared and if the friendship was as strong as you thought, they will continue, as in not just you, but she will make efforts of keeping in touch, texting, calling, visiting, writing, etc...Lucky girl to have someone care for her as you do as just friends, good luck don't let any person get you down, if they don't feel the same way as you do, it suck when they don't but then you know these feeling you have and felt are out there waiting to be showed and given to the one person who is really out there waiting for you. Just have fun, and enjoy whatever time youhave left while she's still around.|`|Jhr68T0baa	You need to tell her how you feel or you'll regret it forever. <br>  Why leave it so late?

6o2SUuhVaa	The answer to this question lies in how you are feeling right now.  If you feel guilty about having made out with him before he told you that he loves you then that may be a sign that you are moving too fast.  Simply having second thoughts is different.  Personally, I think that waiting until you are in love before having sex is a good way to go.  However, kissing, hugging, intimate touching, etc. is normal and not something I consider moving too fast.  There's no right way or wrong way, just your way.|`|uhKBBQ9raa	At 18, it's completely normal. And the "I love you's" come whenever you feel it. Before or after, it doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  Just be careful about the "sex" part if you're a virgin, cause that's what comes after the making out.|`|mL07N3IAaa	i think it should come before. cuz it takes time to say to someone that you love them but not for kissing..

Or ask about an assignment|`|KSC9fCwOaa	dress slutty..that should get him to notice you..no joke|`|frBJEpSnaa	boy crushes are the best, lol. I had that same problem. Mention something like "You wouldn't believe what happened-" or if he has a class that he has before you can can ask him what their doing today, i know its lame but its an excuse! but to be honest you just need a little courage and talk 2 him like that other girl. good luck!
95211d0e5eb98a4a0fdb5680545d4d06aa	I get upset when I can't see or talk to my boyfriend too. What helps me is trying to do my own thing, something that makes me happy and occupies my time. If he's out with friends, I call up my friends and make plans. If he's busy, I can see my own friends, just relax and listen to music or read, sometimes I'll even study because it's not going to get done when I'm with him so I might as well do it while I've got some time. I also try to get involved, like I volunteer with kids and I'm active in my church now. Just find something you'll enjoy and then time will fly until you see your guy again :) You are your own person, so once you live your life a little I think you won't feel as dependent on him for fun. In fact, it'll make your time together that much better!|`|fJOtjZ7Yaa	You need time to be you.  Don't take a break just do your own thing with friends.
wZtDLjO8aa	Welcome to marriage and children. Doesn't' get much better.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Your problem is that you two are not doing any alone time. Yes, kids take up time, but hire a baby sitter and go out to a hotel for a few hours or ask one of your moms to watch them for the night so you can have alone time. You are allowed to have a life outside of your children every now and then.|`|MYU46ap5aa	Yes..  This happened to me (mother of 3).<br>  <br>  Try to put the children to sleep or find a sitter to watch them.  Cook a nice meal for your husand or while he's watching tv put on your sex lingerie and stillettos and let the old you take over.<br>  <br>  There was a reason why he couldn't come up for air before and two made three kids.|`|7jA1FiY8aa	Yup.  3 kids, very little sex, and even less interest.  It happens.  I'm told it comes back around when the kids get a little older and are not so all-consuming, but for now, that's the way it is.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Yup, that's the turning point. It can be hard to get back in the groove...If you are on the pill - talk to your doctor about switching to a lower dose or other alternatives. I went off it completely and WOW what a difference...I never realized how much it was affecting my sex drive. <br>  <br>  The other thing you could try - if you don't already do it - are date nights. Nights you spend together, child free...if you can't remember who you are together (not as parents or workers or whatever) you'll never get to the level in your head that lets you enjoy the relationship again (and the hot sex that goes along with it).<br>  <br>  Lastly - if you are too tired for sex at evenings end - don't wait!  Put those kids to bed and go hit it...don't ask him - tell him to meet you in the bedroom!  Even if it's for a quickie - a quickie is a start and it'll get better from there.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|rpnFxnCQaa	Leigh,<br>  <br>  What you are going through is unfortunately so common. That does not mean you should not take action. But you have started to do so by posting here. Good!<br>  <br>  I think that, perhaps, you and your husband should talk more. This is key.<br>  <br>  Beside communication, you may want to spice things up ... My husband and I tried this website (recommended by my best friend) ... It is very Erotic, in the nicest way. When my husband and I tried some "games", it was like having a new partner. Like falling in Love all over again. We had still been in love but our relationship has since reached a new level. More completeness. You may want to give this a try.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fire-up-your-sex-life.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fire-up-your-sex-life.com/</a><br>  <br>  All the best!|`|58JgbttAaa	yep it happens. i only have one kid he's 5 and we don't really get to have sex that often because he's always here and we have to wait till he goes to sleep but sometimes we fall asleep first so we don't even get to do it. you should try getting someone to babysit, my mom watches him over the weekend, it's good to get away from your kids once in a while and have some alone time.
AA11830890	just have sex with him itll be ok.|`|71VRvldJaa	12 yrs old is too young to be dating and if I was your mom you wouldn't be kissing or going anywhere with a 14 yr old boy!  Give yourself a few more years to grow up!  There will still  be lots of boys around when your 16!  Regardless of how mature you think you are, you are still a little girl!  <br>  If you're not even supposed to be on Yahoo Answers until you're at least 13, why should you be allowed to date!<br>  <br>  By the way.....why does your profile say you are 15 when you're saying you're 12!!|`|FHrQzaPqaa	your father must not know about this. because l know he would not<br>  let you have a boyfriend right now. you need to give yourself some<br>  time to grow up.
AA11909552	Patience. Befriend him. Start a conversation and eventually, you two will talk more and more. Be friendly. Perhaps you could ask him questions about the studies you two are doing in the class.<br>  He might not have a "girlfriend" at all. Don't be scared. Just talk to him. There is nothing wrong with *that*. He obviously likes you, else he wouldn't be staring all the time.<br>  Even if he *does* have a girlfriend, it's not like he's married. You can be his friend and eventually, he may fall for *you*. You REALLY need to start talking to him. Eventually, something may happen that's good.

So this will actually add to future shyness!<br>  <br>  So here is a bold line for you. Find a good looking girl and say: Hello baby! How about showing me your ****!!! <br>  <br>  Trust me, it will get rid of your shyness!!!|`|4ku0wasbaa	Be open and honest with her.  Tell her you are new to the country or area and ask her to show you around.  Just work up to it and when she says yes it will really boost your confidence.|`|QEuZl2e1aa	First, try talking to the girls in your class. You can ask them questions about something going on in class or try to answer their questions. You can ask, "Hey, when is the project due?" or "When is the test?". This will make a good impression because girls will think your are responsible and really into school. Then when you've gotten to know one a little just say, "Hey would you like to get a cup of coffee?" or "Would you like to study with me?" or something like that.|`|x7QFtMZIaa	well, the first thing is observation. you can always comment on her clothes, the music she listens to, maybe even the car she drives (yes there are some girls who know the difference between carburetor and a spark plug). you can always ask about her major, her year, etc. Then you try to let your humor slide in but be observant, sometimes they like coarse jokes, other time they like more sophisticated ones. When you close off, just let them know you are interested in getting to know them better, probably hang out at some event like a social at your campus. then as a coup de gras, ask them for their number or some form of contact info. its safer to ask for email or text numbers since it seems less creepy. good luck!|`|c91sWmqHaa	I assume you have classes with girls.  That's a really good way to get to know someone pretty easily.  You share at least one thing in common right off the bat.  Other than that, you might want to join some clubs or organizations in which you're interested, since you'll meet girls there and be able to talk to them about the club.<br>  <br>  If you're just talking to random girls, say hello, tell them your name, wait for them to tell you theirs, and then ask what they're studying.|`|N7utoIfiaa	Just pretend they are guys, and start up any conversation you would have with your friends.|`|EVs8bXEtaa	creepy.

sqaey2Siaa	Of course. I have been so mad I've thrown things, mostly my cell phone, I slamed the door once causing a picture to fall down and break too. Men have a good way of getting under your skin!!!!|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	I have been that mad, it's weird how you can't even remember the thing though. I think it has to be hormone related or something...<br>  <br>  I think I threw down something that I already had in my hands, like some sort of food container... might have been plastic. It made a mess, but I just stormed out w/o cleaning up.<br>  <br>  I think taking a walk is the best thing you can do. You just need to catch yourself before you get that mad.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	We were on the phone and I pulled a - Ya Ya Sisterhood - move and beat the snot out of the phone while he was still on it...poor phone...I am usually pretty laid back but that was one of those moments I could've reached through the phone and choked him!|`|sVdQSMvJaa	I got so angry at him one day that I was scraming hysterically at him and I threw a pen.  I had bottled up so much anger towards him and it just exploded!!!  Then I looked at my sweet 4 motnh old laying in his arms and it broke me.  I felt awful!!|`|dFUqPcWKaa	Well, I didn't break anything, but in an apartment that we used to live in, the bottom shelf on the refrigerator door had a tendency to pop off and spill everything on the floor - happened every time we got into an argument. Whoever opened the fridge got more pissed off because they had to clean it up, but the other person always fell on the floor laughing, so it was a good tension breaker. :)<br>  <br>  Other than that, I'm sure I've slammed cabinets and whatnot. Never broken anything, but I've slapped him two or three times for disrespecting me.|`|8Vw7Nblpaa	a picture frame, a picture of him. the glass sliced into my hand, bloodied up my knuckles, and sliced into the tendon on my pinky-finger. oh i also broke a chair too... What happened was he was upset about something and ended up going to a friend's house, this obnoxious, vile thing, the girl is far too close and possessive of him, and he thinks ignoring her advances is an "ok" way of handling it...|`|XH5TLKaQaa	I've broke dishes, wine glasses, remote control, bowls, and little knick knacks.  Men do a good job at driving women to the breaking point|`|JmmBCQFjaa	Yes, Threw a cell phone out the window i was so irritated with the situation at the time.|`|AA11825142	I have thrown around some pots and pans in the kitchen lol<br>  You know slamming the cabinets shut... but it was just because I was trying to show him how mad I was.. so mature of me huh?|`|41skve2Yaa	Yea, I broke him.  I broke his heart by leaving him.|`|ufOSDnetaa	several times...one time i threw out all of our dishes he made me so mad..one time i put my hand through our front door glass window, then threw my dumbell out of it to finish it off..|`|AA11967247	my ex did. i was a big thrower of things, the most effective being a large 3 wick candle to the kneecap.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	Back when I was married.<br>  <br>  Once flung my phone across the parking lot because he called me while I was walmarting after work on a friday afternoon and accused me of being with another man.

Looked like hell, but worked great!<br>  <br>  Once cheated on me, so I used his toothbrush to clean the toilet.

RFeYz59maa	Yes, every now and then I have that feeling. Sometimes, I just want to quit everything when it doesn't seem to be going right. But then I think of God. I think of how good he is and I just know that whenever something seems to not be going right, he always turns things around. God reminds me that I will get that husband that loves me for me and not just for my body and that my dreams will come true. There is more to life than bitterness. There  IS happiness too! Life is what you make of it. If you sit around and feel sorry for yourself, well then you're gonna have a sad life, but if you get up and think positive and make things happen for yourself, then you'll have a great fulfilling life. Its ok to cry and feel down sometimes, but don't cry too long because you have a life to live. Good luck!|`|8VclqMZQaa	I do feel that way.. im right there with you...

I actually find the little "cute" girls to be sexier than most of those celebrities you are talking about.  <br>  <br>  But if I had to say I would say a fit body and the right curves are what make those celebrity girls look so sexy.

Make sure the baby is in bed for the night or taking a long nap. Start off by apologizing for being such a nag lately and that you think some of it is just adjusting to motherhood and has nothing to do with him. Then ask him again if he will go to marriage counseling with you. If he says no then you go to counseling on your own and learn how to deal with marriage and a baby. There is a great book called "The Dance of Anger" I forget who the author is but it is well worth the money. I think the author is Harriet Lerner but I might be wrong. I loaned my book to a friend.  It is not a long book and comes in paper back. It basically tells you that every time you get into an argument or disagreement with your spouse or any close relative or friend, you do it the same way every time. After a while you and the other person know how to push each others buttons. You have to learn how to get away from falling into this trap. If you think back on the fights you have had with your husband, I bet you have said the same things in anger over and over again. You have to stop the cycle of anger and learn how to communicate without getting angry and without getting your husband angry. Please go to counseling and find out how to communicate in a marriage. You sound a little insecure and a little immature and I might be wrong but you sound young and needy. Just get some professional help.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Go get help yourself,your husband does'nt have the problem.Your the stalking and snooping on him so go get the help you need if you truly want to change things for the sake of your child|`|D3hYbsVJaa	He sounds like me, a few years of work on my anger at the world removed. Is it possible he's upset about other things, you make it like he shouldn't be? That's called invalidation. It's not entirely your fault , but your both responsible for where you are. He needs to open up, constructively mind you, and you need to realize he's not mad at you and stop villainizing him. I suspect he's only emotionally abusive after you protect the things that annoy him. Stop it. You don't have ot agree with him, or do anything about it. Just let him do the low-volume grumbling that you want us to think is emotional abuse and stop acting like he's mad at you.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	give him a apology and talk to him about your being insecure and the reasons you feel that way and respect his answers.<br>  when you share from the heart you give a great gift beyond value share your personal secrets with your husband alone, and comfort him and try to be understanding as he married you and be glad he did not fight you but left instead, and stop fussing about every little thing let some things that are not really important go, and laugh and play and kiss and hug and share. go put the baby down for a nap and go back to bed with your husband, and if you won't listen then how can marriage counseling work. check your self first. read your question and you can see you have more issues then he does, change them. good luck.Edit<br>  stop nagging and snooping and be the woman he had in the beginning, you are not a mistake, but you are making him think that maybe his ex was not so bad after all and if he won't talk you write him a letter, you fight for him if you want him and you and baby boy will win, but stop nagging and how do you know that he did not set you up to find the e-mail cause he does know you snoop.|`|f2129bc33b7957a77b67647b1f8d266baa	One night apart doesn't mean your marriage is over. That seems like a big leap but you can't force someone to be in a relationship with you if they don't want to.<br>  <br>  Just because his ex is in another country doesn't mean he isn't cheating on you with her or with someone else.|`|11cf8f776163fff338cd696072ad743aaa	get help for yourself. that is all you can do. you know you have an issue or two. he might see this and be inspired to work things out with you. it does sound like the end, but that doesn't mean there can't be a new relationship based on something deeper. i encourage you to help bring about transformation - in a good way.|`|wsyeQQhWaa	You ned counseling and you need to  do it for yourself first. Also, read books on marriage, like Dr. Phil's Family First. I read it and it helped me with a few things that bothered me. Plus, I just love Dr. Phil.<br>  Hang in there, things are rough for everyone these days.|`|AA11969451	He is emotionally abusive but he isn't a bad guy?!?!?! Lady, abuse is abuse. Do not enable him by justifying his bad behavior. He is a bad egg and you are an insecure snoop. Quit being codependent and stand up for yourself and your son.|`|zu10q3Qyaa	Maybe it would be good for you to go to marriage counseling without him.  You sound like you could benefit by talking to someone about your problems and getting advise on what to do.  Good luck to you.|`|dzNnf3LHaa	COMMUNICATION.  Number one in marriage, without it your marriage won't work.  You two need to sit down and talk I mean really talk.  If he doesn't say anything then you just keep talking until he breaks.|`|14tr16uuaa	To be frank, you both really need to see a marriage counselor, or at least a minister. Problems like this are usually very hard to solve with just the two of you and a mediator is wonderful to help keep you both focused.(and not arguing)<br>  <br>  Both of you are under stress with an infant in the house and it will probably only get worse as he gets older.<br>  <br>  I know he doesn't want to go to marriage counseling, but I think it would really help. Just try out one session and see how you like it. I think is would do you both good.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped, Good Luck!|`|cDRXtuJCaa	well it sounds like their fault on both side so stop trying to take all the blame <br>  I think if you are going through a lot of emotions you should see a doctor,you may have postnatal depression <br>  I ask your husband again about counseling when he calm but if you want a good marriage with love and respect it take both of you working at it but it foolish to accept the situation in fear he leave as it not the answer either|`|vk3dKR3Caa	Why don't you trust him?  trust is very important in a relationships.

Tell him that you're not trying to get him to make a decision about the marriage before the seminar but that you just want him to go to the seminar to see if it can work. It's important for him to know that you are just asking him to go to the seminar and not to make a decision about the marriage yet. <br>  <br>  The best marriage seminar I know of it sourced below.|`|4POGapREaa	Go to individual therapy instead.  I've done that 3 separate times in my life when I just needed to clear my head & get some inspiration for change.  You're absolutely right that people get sick of the snooping & accusations.  It can kill a marriage really quick.  I understand you say he's cold but has he ever given you actual reason to feel you need to check on him or think he's having an affair?  If not, then those are your issues alone & you need to work on resolving them.  If you can't afford or don't want individual therapy, then look into buying some books on marriage & trust issues.|`|EQeX35dWaa	I am sorry for you and your son.   I hope you get some counseling.  Maybe a good friend to talk to as well.   I am sure he is not a bad person but the emotionally abusive part is not good.   You and your husband deserve peace and love in your life.   If you go for help maybe he will see the positive change in you and get help too.
7gDeqlfnaa	Yes, the same situation happens to me most times. Here is what I suggest, only suggest, don't really qualify for being a good adviser, or at least I think so. If she goes with you, then you go with her, if she goes with a bf, then you go with a bf too, or if you don't have a bf, then 2 things you can do. First, bring another guy who is good friends or just bring in another friend who can crash the scene. For me, it is sad if I go out with my bf, they together and i'm all lonely, came just to watch.|`|6Rru2901aa	The question was answered once you said that your mother said no. Mothers are mostly right. You will thank her one of these days. If possible ask you mom why she doesn't want you to go and try to understand it. Your friend doesn't give you clothing nor does she feed you so if she never want to talk to you again for that, who cares. <br>  <br>  It's better to lose your friendship, than your mother's trust!<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  Moe.|`|AOwZNtQuaa	well it depends on how close your friend and her boyfriend are. and how all over each other they usually are. ive gone out with my friend and her boyfriend before and i didnt feel like a third wheel at all. but ive also gone out with another one of my friends and her boyfriend and i felt so out of place because they were all over each other. if you arent comfortable going with just them invite a guy for you or just tell her that you arent comfortable. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aj2_dVA4xBSKcJL_gMwzBhHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090308091948AAOHkCK">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|QAz85Uuraa	Don't go.|`|wCOySYL2aa	Seems like shes a bit scared of being alone with her bf, so you should go with her and explain to your mom why you're going.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	If your mom doesn't allow you, then that's your answer, you don't go.

rnbt5PEOaa	i'd say break up with him, you owe him that. BUT PLEASE PLEASE do not use the "I'm not ready for a relationship" line, everyone knows that that is just a line. So then he's going to start wondering who you want instead of him, and what's going on, he's going to become extremely moody towards you because he won't think he can trust you. Don't use it, just tell him that there's no one else, you thought you liked him, you do care about him, but there's no intimacy there. Might sting, but it'll work it's way in and out all at once, not like the one liners which will mess with his head. : ) bottom line is, end it, but be careful what you say!|`|VKGnX0Lvaa	I think you should break up with him. It's not fair to be led on, just like you wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone who is only with you because of pity. If and when you break up with him, be sure to be as honest as possible and be gentle. Make sure to put yourself in his shoes and be careful how your words are coming across.<br>  Good luck! :]|`|F0sJR0jbaa	Yeah tough thing.  You have to end it though.  Just make it painless like you said.  You feel horrible and you don't want to hurt him so just be nice.  Tell him your not ready for a relationship right now.  Thats all you have to say to him.|`|N2BAdOXEaa	Look at some point you will just have to tell him, and yes it will hurt, unless you find him a replacement for you. Just try to point out that the two of you are not compatible, but he will be a great catch for the right girl and you will help introduce him to someone else. Good luck with your choices.|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	Just be honest with him.<br>  <br>  Tell him he doesn't have enough money, and then tell him to get lost.<br>  <br>  It's easy!

gQBqgzJmaa	I've heard there are two reasons people get divorced:<br>  <br>  1)  People break up within the first five years, in which case they were probably not right for each other.<br>  2)  People break up after many years together, in which case they usually experienced some major life change and couldn't cope with it.<br>  <br>  So it could take any number of years to "erode" a happy marriage.  I'm not sure what the average would be.|`|WUwIk3Fgaa	Not all happy marriages "erode" and end in divorce. Nor, do all of the marriages, that were never happy at any point, lead to divorce. There are so many factors involved when making the decision of whether or not to divorce and end an unhappy marriage. And I don't think I feel like listing them all. I don't think there is a set amount of time that it takes for this to potentially happen. It just depends on the husband and the wife and how much or how little they want to give to the marriage and whether they are willing to work on their issues or not.|`|wCTq9p2Uaa	It's real easy if you let it come down to that. For example, a couple can get mad about bills or anything that has to do with the car or the house. If one of the couple says to the other " That's it. We are getting a divorce." The other has the opportunity to try to save their marriage or he or she can agree that it's time for a divorce. You have to make some sacrifices to succeed in your marriage, such as working hard to get the bills paid. Even in the summer, you have to make a sacrifice to mow the yard. Marriage is about total commitment. You have to be totally committed to your spouse. I hope this helped you. Good luck!|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	It depends on how dumb the guy is.

Parents are just people too and it is not easy , all they can do is be the best that they can and are. there is no instructions on how to be a  good parent. If they didn't freak out or say anything.. They wouldn't care, their just worried, or maybe tired of repeating the same words to you over and over, not they are tired of you, but the things you might do... only you know this, example, talk back , don't come home when you should, etc.. bad grades.. but this is normal kid behavior, that we all go through and grow out of as your parents and all we are just people and no one is perfect. But we can think things through, stop for a minute, Make choices, right or wrong,if wrong, take it as a lesson and know what does not work for you, etc. As for these people writing things or saying things about you,Ignorance, it sucks but there just their opinions and think of it how bored they are that they have time to put into writing anyhting about you, don't let it bother you or hurt you, easy said that done, but know who you are inside. Be strong and don't let things that other people say or do to bother you, their just bored and actually maybe they think your a real interesting person, that they have time to take out of their everyday lives to sit down and write or talk about you, they need to get a life,.Be strong for yourself ..Try to, as you should respect your parents , even if it not easy and it seems hard to, but they just want what is good for you, they are not your enemy, but the only people you can trust and hopefully go too.Also what you have little or alot they have provided what they have, appreciate it all even if its a little, but appreciate them for trully, really, loving you. Learn to love yourself. Be strong ,turn the other cheek , delete and disconnect yourself from any situation that is causing you to feel the way you do.Hurt , sad, upset, , Life is great and it hasn't even begun for you, take a deep breath, Inhale .Exhale, stand up tall, shoulders straight, chin up,  head high,look straight ,move forward and keep going. Never look down always hold your head up straight and high, onward.Best of Luck to ya, chicky. Go outside and feel the sun on your face, even when the sun is not out smell the air and enjoy whats around you, the things that are all around you naturally. take care of you and always know that you are number 1.
cUO2zYsnaa	There's two things. She's either turned off by you, and that's why she's asking people if you ACTUALLY like her, or she is interested in you, so she's taking the time to ask people if you like her. But I would put my money on the fact that she likes you, because she laughs at a lot of stuff you say online, or in instant messages. But one thing, dont ask her out by making it a "hang out", make it a date. So dont say "wanna hang out with me and my buddies?" Say "wanna go out with me to catch this new movie? I heard it was good", or something like that. Girls dont like it when you pretend to hang out, but actually think of it as a date.|`|LGnWz7F2aa	She's at least interested, period.<br>  <br>  and yes it does increase your chances. but go at her pace too and think of her and how she feels on your acts if she does like you.<br>  Make sure to make her laugh and smile! lol|`|ILyrLkX2aa	Just ask her.|`|ONrxMuDNaa	Yeah she seems to like you :)
v96pYAg1aa	Answer is yes its natural and its not weird to think about it ur only human right?...yes that  is a fact considering the conversation ive been having with you :3...so yeah its normal to think about sex and to be curious about it too|`|9MTJ5Ip0aa	Yes its natural, I was curious before I did
cmEi3CVqaa	no need to punish him just explain that it's not polite and tbh if anything it's funny and it's good to have a laugh with ur kids but dont let it go too far. and maybe he's picked it up from somewhere, at skl, other kids, the park, at home? <br>  <br>  he hasnt done anything wrong and he's probs really confused right now wondering where he went wrong, dont confused him for another 25 mins, go up there now and explain that he needs to be on his best behaviour and not be silly. dont shout but have a firm voice, give him a hug and get him socislising again. <br>  <br>  my parents used to tell me off for the most littliest stupidest things when i was little, like telling a joke my dad had said the day before soem where inappropriate but it shows how impressionable little kids are and i wud constantly get mixed messages, it takes a toll on ur relationship, im now 16 and dont really have that gd a relationship deep down with either of my parents, i dont really trust them and think they are unpredictable. so set it straight with ur son now before it gets too late. <br>  <br>  hope it helps x|`|FeEU1IDOaa	Tell him the truth about what, exactly? If you mean giving him the birds and the bees talk, then that's up to you. But I don't think punishing him is necessary here. He was probably just trying to be funny. If you don't want him to do it again, just tell him so - but don't make him feel that he was doing something horribly wrong. It's normal kid behavior, after all, even if he is a boy. Just tell him that you know boobies are pretty fascinating, but don't pretend to have them. And when he asks why, tell him that it's not very nice and he might offend a lady, and he wouldn't want that, would he?<br>  <br>  Don't freak out. All kids do stuff like that. It's normal. It doesn't mean there's something wrong with him or anything like that.|`|i9nlUZb0aa	Just talk with your son and let him know that what he did was not something that he should be doing. And that if he has any question for you that he would like you to answer, you would be glad too. Then ask him where he learned that from and take it from there. He's only six and must have seen someone else doing it and thought he would mimic them. Just tell him not to do it again, but punish no. Good-luck|`|uIWSJYa7aa	Im a girl,<br>  but what i would do is just tell him that he shouldn't be doing that, <br>  he prbly was just trying to be funny and has no idea he did anything wrong. but just tell him he is not in trouble but i would tell him the truth and try not to be 2 upset because he doesn't really understand|`|XroZY4xQaa	although, im not a guy imma say. Tell him the truth, he has to understand what he did, and how disrespectful it is to the women around him. its better he finds out from you, then his friends. (imagine what his friends will tell him?)|`|1QUruNqkaa	I know you didn't women to reply but its like a red button and being told not to push it. I think its normal what you did. I really wouldn't go into a lot of detail with him since he is so young but I would tell him that that is for girls and not boys. Punishing him isn't the best thing to do since he doesn't even know what they are. Good luck.|`|L2AWPUVXaa	LOL your son is just having fun, but be serious and tell him that you should not do that, because he is not a girl, he is a boy and boys do not have boobies and therefore he is in the wrong for doing that. <br>  <br>  dont punish him!|`|OXr6AKyaaa	Tell him that boys don't have boobies, not unless their fat LOL!, Don't freak out. That'll only freak him out or make him think you don't love him. Don't think the worse- Maybe he is "fascinated" by breasts! In a good way! Good Luck!|`|Ipj0dbrQaa	DONT punish him, all kids experiment and he wont realise that it isn't appropriate to act like that unless you explain why , by punishing him you make boobs a dirty thing|`|sgwe4DpBaa	im sorry im a girl, but if i were his mother i would tell him the truth and punish him a bit but not to much because he is young|`|PhwOfrrgaa	why can't women respond I think this question is for everyone. Anyways I think you should just tell him that it is wrong to do that and that he need to behave like a normal 6 year old boy. There is no reason to punish him he is just a kid talk to him and hopefully he listens
zzaScg0haa	It depends on the girl and the type of relationship you have
i0jVqB0Gaa	well listen my sister had this same prob to so it all depends if your friend really is ur friend if she is then sure shell be angry but shell get over it and u guys will be friends again but if she really isnt ur friend then u just apologize and shell for give if she is a true friend hope this helps good luck and bye|`|AGnXddI9aa	Whatever happened to the days of Fonzie and Potsie huh? When things were simple and Joanie loved Chachi and there was no mistake about that. The good old days when people didnt go out with their best friend's crushes. It's a real sick world we live in, overrun with immoral people who don't know the difference between right and wrong in life. All the animals come out at night, the buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets.|`|AA12042031	that suxx! u either loose ur best friend or u loose the guy u rele like...idk i think u should go out with him if shes the sort of person that would get over it. just like talk to her and tell her how u feel and tell her that u dont like him on purpose..like u dont like him and wanna go out with him because she likes him but bcause u rele like him and u cant help it...hopefull shell understand!|`|W8KWaHlnaa	Yeah I know you were probably expecting an answer from a chick but I might be able to help. Tell your friend that you like him too. Try and see if you can come up with an agreement.  I suggest that neither of you date him and the hotter of you two call me. lol just kidding! but neither should go out w/him. if one does, that will create jealousy and then your friendship may end.|`|m5tvuGA2aa	i think you should talk to your friend first about him to see if she would be ok with you going out with him. hopefully she would be a good friend and let you go out with him, but if she gets mad, is this guy really worth possibly ruining your friendship? good luck :)|`|S3JbeBCYaa	ask her ''if i liked a guy and he asked you out what would you do'' and see what she says. then tell her what has happened and say that you are sorry but you REALLY like him. she will be piss*d off at first but if you are close enough then you will get through it!<br>  <br>  good luck:)|`|j2Ca8sgjaa	umm, if you want to keep your friend you wouldn't do it. <br>  <br>  if you're selfish and don't care how you hurt your friends then go for it|`|LA5JUW5Iaa	kay here's the thing...GUYS will come and go. Best FRIENDS are forever. They are the ones who pick you up when the guy breaks your heart. DONT DO IT|`|Likst1Mxaa	like I always say:<br>  <br>  date him: don't have a best friend anymore (for at least for awhile)<br>  <br>  don't date him: be annoyed with your BFF for ruining your love life, which will end up iin resenting her and being annoyed everytime she talks to this guy.|`|7eaf5c689c77b9c042b4be96ab16b8abaa	Do you want to be happy or do you want your friend to be happy?<br>  <br>  If he is working on you, he isn't that into her.  Have a talk with your friend - then go have fun with him.|`|BftuXp1Iaa	well if you like him yeah.<br>  if you don't tell your friend you are going out with him, and do this. bring up your friend all the time and how she is great, and try not to be the best you are. then break up with him, or get him to dump you.<br>  then she can go ask him out|`|PsVZrmTOaa	I don't think that would be a good idea....If she's really your best friend, then you shouldn't hurt her feelings...maybe you could somehow tell her that he likes YOU, and see what she says?!|`|KqQlWbYsaa	If you did not have any actual agreement with this friend tat you would not go out with a fellow that she likes, even likes to the point of love, I cannot say that you cannot do as you please as to the being asked out.  Look at it this way:  If this fellow liked your friend, wouldn't he have asked your friend out, not you?<br>  <br>  While it would certainly be better for you to let your friend know in advance that this fellow has an interest in you, if you feel that you don't have the courage to do this, I guess, ultimately, the chips have to fall where they may.|`|QBV4cFbqaa	DONT go out with him. Do you love your friend more or this guy? She's your best friend. Yeah she might understand if you do go out with him because that is what friends do we understand each other. But imagine when you guys are kissing and hugging goodbye right in her face. How sad would that be. Imagine if your crush would ask her out. In other words put yourself in her shoes. <br>  I would never do that to a friend. It's like against the law. LOL. <br>  It's up to you. Piece of advise: talk to her before you say yes or no to him she will appreciate your friendship even more. goodluck.

Now would be a good time to change your mind.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	I am a girl but if you want to try something new just go to your local video store get a xrated video and watch it together and practice on him. that way if you do a few tricks for him, he won't wonder about where you got those ideals from with out having the movie.|`|iZDsMCghaa	Why wait until later that night?<br>  When he gets home have dinner ready, be dressed(or partly so) in something very hot. Serve his dinner, serve him in general. Before you eat, remove his shoes then or after remove his shirt. Give him a sensual(not deep tissue) ,massage with oils or lotion (my husband hates the oils). Oh and have candles lit or dim lighting and nice music, low when he arrives.<br>  So, yeah, I lost track, the massage, dinner,your hot something to wear. Be nude when you rub him down and rub "yourself" "innocently" on him while you do. <br>  The hottest part will probably be the serving him in lingerai and heels, the sex will already be expected but the way it will all play out will be hot. Have the room already lit with candles and other "supplies" you may use so you dont have to fundle for them later.when he is on his stomache and your on his back, kiss his ear and all that good happy stuff, whisper dirt talk. Finish the "massage" with oral, slow and in a savoring way, tell him how yummy he tastes and make love t it dont just do the deed. Rub it on your face, all that happy stuff but dont let him finish and YOU do all the work until he decides to take over. <br>  <br>  <br>  He will be a happy man.|`|zu10q3Qyaa	I'm not a guy but if your into oral sex then that is probably one of the most erotic things you can do for him, besides a massage first.|`|bRghNySvaa	wear something sexy with a lot of but showing serve him dinner in it make sure you bend over alot in front of him grabing him once in a while getting him excited then when the time comes he will love it|`|FZLiRKIjaa	lap dance|`|0WnYz7Z4aa	Invite to the dinner woman that you would fell comfortable in bed with , and let's the games begin .

bdmRHIaZaa	This is tough, i prefer love but with children involved this requires a lot more thinking.|`|Hkb7xoaQaa	wow, thats pretty tough. I think you should try and distance yourself from the second person for a while, just to get a hold of your decision without the emotional reinforcement. It is a very tough decision to make, you have to worry about the kids, your future, finances, and so much more.... but i think giving yourself some time to think about the cons and pros and weigh out what is best. Of course you being truly happy and truly in love is important but sometimes you have to put love on hold, especially when its your children involved. My dad left my mom in a pretty similar situation, he ended up happy but he lost the great relationship he had with his kids. I hope that last part didn't sway you in anyway, i just wanted to convey the severity of the situation.
c91sWmqHaa	It depends on what you're really looking for.  If you're looking for absolute certainty and closure, you need to confront him and tell him how you feel.  If you just want to be out of the situation with as little complication and muss as possible, just stop flirting with him (hell, you might try not talking to him).|`|CeVvhTckaa	tell him how u feel about him<br>  if he doesnt feel<br>  the same back<br>  then yea u should stop
RpIdwgzJaa	Depends. Is the serious side worth waiting for? Is it worth what you'll end up enduring?<br>  With some guys it's totally natural to act gay, even though you aren't. It's almost like saying any girls that walk arm in arm or hug in the halls are lesbian. Sometimes they're just friends.<br>  "i'll ask him why, and he'll answer with an "i just didn't wanna talk to you"." Sometimes, we just don't. That's him being honest. I'd consider that with whatever else you're thinking.<br>  But if you think you can get someone better, then by all means move on. Never hold yourself back.|`|AA10336148	girlfriend, my advice to you is to leave him. You don't deserve this kind of treatment no matter what. There's gotta be someone out there who you will love wholeheartedly (and not "halfly").<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|i8fj5qkbaa	If you really like him, tell him  all the reasons you love him and also tell him you hate when he's in that certain mood.|`|ybEOjgTwaa	If hes getting jealous and moody already id stay away.  Sounds like the warning signs of an abusive boyfriend.|`|TkHFoHpJaa	he sounds really moody..<br>  you should move on and find someone that ALWAYS wants to talk to you and loves you all the time not just on whatever day they feel like..|`|lO5wyK50aa	the guys gay! lmao|`|wJLOTRIaaa	I think you should leave him alone.

If you truly love him then you have to love everything about him.  Most people don't know the true definition of love only their own understanding of what they think or want it to mean.  The Bible states that love is patient, kind, enduring, boastless, not envy, and etc.  Love conqueors all things and you seem to have a long list of things that you do not like about him where as to the short list of things you do like about him.  That right there tells me that its not going to work.  If you feel that he is gay then why even take it any further?  You need to pray and ask God to reveal to you the things you can not see about the guy and then ask God what to do afterwards.|`|bNx1q5oWaa	leave him <br>  im like him with the cool side but the bad side can be dangerous<br>  just imagine u talking 2 some other guy while yall going out what do u think hes gonna do?|`|CKMH0tloaa	STick him between a rock and a hard place.

gILygKvRaa	Unwanted Goodbye?|`|874EAxkfaa	how about Oscar and the Pizza!
bDoJuBEkaa	First it sounds like you guys already agreed on a separation before he even got back in contact with her. So really since you guys already agreed to break up it's none of your business really.<br>  <br>  Secondly there is obviously and intimate relationship by what they are sharing, if that extends to sex or not no one can say. But again since you have already said you want a separation too and nothing you have said indicates either one of you wants to work it out it again is not really your business.<br>  <br>  Finally, someone said text the woman and for all intensive purposes threaten her. I would urge you not to do that it will only make things worse and nasty for everyone involved including the children. Honestly I think you should just go on with the separation and your life. To do otherwise would just be whiny and vindictive and your child needs a role model of a strong independent woman with pride and self respect.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Why do you care if you're getting separated and have been having problems anyway. It sounds like you know you shouldn't be together. The new relationships he form now are really none of your business. Get out of there, stop focusing on him and focus on yourself and your relationships.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	well i think he a liar for the tex meesages sound like he at something with her <br>  I ask him to leave and sooner than later he making a fool out of you,why are you letting him <br>  If it over let him go and i arange for access to be at another house <br>  If you get a chance i send her a message and tell her you be using all the tex messages in the divorce settlement and better still find were her husband works let him see it see if he happy|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Should you believe him! are you for real? how many more clues do you need.|`|e1c7a6271ad6e2c76bcc9db56e32540baa	All the signs are there.  Men (and some women) will lie about this until their last breath.  If he hasn't had sex with her yet, he is having an emotional affair and soon will.  Actually, from the texts, sounds like they already are physically intimate.  I've been single for a long time.  I am no longer amazed at how many married men are out there looking for some fun, and I'm sure they don't all run home and confess when asked.  You're scared to move on.  Change is always scary.  Just got to do it.  Step off the curb and take it one step at a time.|`|jBigEy0Caa	I do not text guys that are my friends saying that I love them.  I also do not call them sweetie.  I am a married woman, and that would be incredibly inappropriate.  He has been acting strange and now you have confirmed his behavior by seeing it.  You should really seek marriage counseling before this gets any worse and I would tell him to stop seeing her or it's over.|`|TTjDATeOaa	He is definitely having an affair with her. That's my opinion. But if you guys are on the verge of seperation you should go ahead and do it.|`|AA10064730	I could have written your question. I'm going through the same thing. My husband still claims that the woman sending him messages is just a friend at work (but she's sending them at 4am then good morning messages at 10am). My husband and I are starting marriage counseling next week to try to move past all of this. It may be something for you to look into. <br>  <br>  I know that in the past my husband has had an emotional affair where he turn to another woman to discuss his feeling with her. They never did get intimate but she fell in love with him and left her husband for him. He walked away from the affair shortly after I found out. <br>  <br>  Your husband may not be having a physical affair with this woman but he's turning to her for something. Try to talk with him about it (I know it's hard because husbands don't listen). Maybe set up the counseling to see if the marriage can be saved.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	WOW, girl more clues you cannot get. C"mon! he's been OBVIOUSLY cheating on you with that ****. Divorce him now and if you can tell her husband, she ended up destroying your marriage, you destroy hers. He doesn't deserve her anyway.|`|ee2eb688bade7663b57e940f752dc454aa	You are already, by your description "on the verge of separation".<br>  As difficult as that may be, especially with a baby, I think you should just go ahead with the separation because if this guy hasn't sexually cheated on you yet, he certainly has been having an inappropriate relationship with this other woman. The text messages more than confirm this.<br>  He has already demonstrated that he cannot be trusted; he lied to you about having lunch with her. How many lies do you have to catch him in to accept that he is a liar? How can you trust someone who lies to you?<br>  All the other stuff about her texts is simply BS on his part.<br>  Courage and strength to you. It really is time to get away from this man. No marriage should be like this. You deserve better.|`|lvzlpjl2aa	well it's obvious he wants out. he's said it himself. the fact it, no married man should be carrying on with another female in that way. messaging that way either. i think that once you are separated, if not already, these two will hook up. now, my suggestion, if you want this to work between the 2 of you, you need to tell him you want to make it work. he stops all contact with this woman, and if he feels like going to lunch with her again, you and her husband need to be present. i would also advise you two to get some counseling.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	You don't need to put up with this crap. Tell your husband either he is an open book or you're through with him.<br>  You shouldn't have to share him and you're right, he's not being honest about his relationship with her. If he was, he wouldn't be secretive about it. You and your child deserve better. I think your husband and his skank friend deserve each other.|`|yw7AeZn2aa	Im not sure what you are looking for everyone to tell you but I think he is def having a relationship with her. For sure. <br>  <br>  I think you should get your affairs in order, get a lawyer, figure out how you will support yourself without your husband, figur eout childcare so you can get a ajob etc. Maybe you can work it out- but you need to be prepared for your childs sake and your own. It sounds like he is going to be ready to leave soon. Im sorry.|`|zu10q3Qyaa	Short answer.  They are both way out of line.  First of all she is messed up for talking to him the way she does and he is messed up for not telling her to stop it.  They sound like children.  If your getting seperated then move on if your working on your relationship then you should be very worried about it.  I'd tell her and her husband that you think it's inappropriate for her to talk to him that way and she should probably not even be friends with him.|`|7vAYJZSkaa	You don't need contact lenses to read the writing on the wall. His actions are speaking volumes.<br>  <br>  Stop questioning him about it, stop questioning yourself about the relationship lasting, and start figuring out how to get out out of it smoothly, and safely.<br>  <br>  Best of luck<br>  <br>  K<br>  <br>  SWEET MILDRED SENT ME TO HELP YOU|`|9DSSJTrUaa	The unfortunate answer is no, you should not believe him.  If nothing was going on he would not be lying to you.  It is one thing to not tell an event to avoid an argument but the moment he started lying about his whereabouts - red flag #1.  The moment he started hiding his phone from you, he does not want you to see what he is sending and receiving - red flag #2.  The moment he started telling "his friend" "love you" - red flag #3.  Regarding whether you should leave him - in the end that is your choice - only you know whether you should - but I would suggest you at least should start financially and emotionally preparing for possible separation - so you are not caught unprepared if he should up and leave you. - No matter what - focus on you and your baby and do what is best for the two of you -|`|EjHJ0al6aa	Don't take any of that crap from you husband "oh that's how she normally talks with her mates and I'm like a total ********".  JUst get away as fast as you can, you don't want to get tied down by bastards who need to get their heads out of their arses.  You are your own priority- not them.  LEAVE HIM NOW.  Let them have their own little relationship and regret it but run now and don't ever go back.  Get help from mates and family.|`|lNl1bdWXaa	Im sorry you are going through this right now but is a separation the best way to go. To me there are lies going on and you need to get to the bottom of it. Find out where their having lunch at and do a surprise meeting and ask this woman if she feels that she wants your husband and make your decision on that meeting. See he wants out and there is a reason why and if the woman is the reason, take him to court and get that money. He cheated, stepped out on you.
CBa9G4j4aa	Be really sweet, stand up for me when people are making fun of me, hug and talk with me when I need him and still stick around with me even if his friends are saying he's whipped or something.|`|OrPz8Zhoaa	BE FUNNY!<br>  when a guy is picking on her tell them 2 knock it off and that she doesnt deserve his crap<br>  Complient things a guy wouldnt normall compliment<br>  and when ur doing it, do it like its no big deal<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  "Whoa your eyes are really blue/green/brown/WATEVER. Its awesome!"
784H1Qujaa	You can only check the history if he saved it on to your computer. Get a fake name and start flirting with him.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	You have to go into options and tick the bit where it says save conversation or something like that. I personally have never done it but if you suspect your bf is talking to other girls on msn he wont be saving his conversations will he ?<br>  After 5 years you should be able to speak up surely rather than sneaking around and causing your self grief. Have it out with him for goodness sake.|`|H4wa95QTaa	Msn chat log - Mine is usually found in my recieved files.  But that's if he keeps a msn chat log for all the chat messages he has had.<br>  <br>  Snooping is not good though, just ask him.|`|efzoxU0uaa	go to my documents then either my reidieved files or chat log and click his email and it should bring up his contacts emails,hen click the persons email you think he is cheating with and simply read..have fun<br>  <br>  listen to carrie underwood - before he cheats i think it suits a time like this.<br>  x.x.x|`|6Kx2QP7Faa	you can only check his history if he has saved the conversation ..<br>  sorry.. if you think he is cheating-ask him questions that can give you clues or just have a conversation and tell him how you feel|`|JQjs3cB3aa	you can only if he has saved his history and most ppl dont
HgN8S3A1aa	You deserve so much better than either of them, get out of this love triangle and find someone who wont mess with your feelings! If you are serious about this guy (the 2 month ex) I'd say go for him.. but stay away from his friend! He sounds like trouble!! He sounds like a d*ck!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|61649d6425b61bc4f5b5ea20d6e20a1faa	You should take a couple months off from dating any of these guys.  It seems their needs to be some time for whatever is going on between you and these guys to blow over.  Seems it is really confusing and time off would do some good.  So take a month or two and just be friends with these guys.|`|d48679660a0be6c2df638cb133b247eaaa	Yes you should talk to him. Probably you should talk a little about the wierd stuff and let him know its wierd because lettin it out is the only way things might not be so freaky. then you both can be best friends who knows
ZC4ZNVzGaa	I personally think you should back off. He has a girlfriend and you said they are "in love" and just because they are opposites and you two are very similar doesn't mean anything. He apparently likes her and she obviously likes him a lot too so you should step back and give them their chance together. You wouldn't like it if some girl was constantly trying to movie in on the boy you love would you?<br>  <br>  But if you feel so strongly that he may have feelings for you, the best thing you can do is talk to him about it. You will never know unless you do something about it. But if it turns out he's just really flirty or likes you as a really good friend, then just let it be. But you never know, so talk to him.|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	No posting|`|EDXh0tk9aa	that question has been deleted so there is no way to answer it.<br>  <br>  Could be he likes you but is afraid to break up with her or doesn't want to hurt her. However, as long as  he has a girlfriend he's Off-Limits and Unavailable and you should stay away from him or you could be the one with a broken  heart.|`|dkevqCtkaa	Maybe you could just ask him what his feelings are toward you, that way you will get an idea without asking him to go out with you and risking your friendship if he says no. Just be careful how you put it because you don't want to upset his girlfriend, especially if he says he just wants to be friends.Good luck!|`|07A3OFDFaa	leave the guy alone. he gotta gf!|`|2c88J3M7aa	Maybe he likes both of you at the same time.. it happens (:<br>  Just give him some time to figure out who he likes more <3|`|fj0ioMpjaa	yes maybe and no it's take a guy a lot quicker to get over girls then we do so just ask him be polite with he can either lie or be honesty if he's lie then it not worth it he honesty then maybey'alll can work things out|`|TmPiF9hcaa	maybe you never kno i think you should go for it and ask him out :)
sRKO8s6jaa	Yes we do feel them. Unless it's only a light hug, then we might not.|`|Hkb7xoaQaa	Definety. Not to a point where we're completely distracted or focused on them, but we know there there and we know how great they feel. It becomes less and less of something to notice the better you know the girl and the older we get...|`|uhKBBQ9raa	There's some guys who hug VERY tight, so I guess those kind of guys do. lol<br>  But I wanna know :P|`|0VDMp2Q0aa	Yes.|`|gRXy66dOaa	well yeah, i would do that back in high school..|`|rAr5j962aa	Well, they are right there.

He's expressing an interest in the only way he can - indirectly.  He's not in love with you or anything yet, but he likes you.  If you like him...smile at him, touch his arm when you're talking, ask him to help you with your homework or help him with his.  Let him lead.  He'll let you know if he wants to take it to the next level. :)  Good luck!
RDgyb7W8aa	Best thing to talk to your friend first. You know how she feels now tell her how you feel.  Ask her if she is going to ask him out and when. Tell her you want to be friends but if she doesn't ask him you will.  That way you are not stabbing her in the back.|`|3ydmsRA1aa	well, you need to talk to your friend about this. <br>  ask her how she feels about him?<br>  if she cares for him alot you have to let her know that you like him too and your not gonna give him up for her..<br>  so yous will just have to drop him because no guy is worth a friendship.<br>  believe me..  ive been in this situation before and all it does is get friends to fight.|`|yFSv9sfgaa	yeah, when two friends like the same guy it sucks. I've had to make agreements with friends that we wouldn't date the guy because it wouldn't be fair for one of us. And plus, those friends are the ones that are gonna stay around a lottttt longer then the guy.|`|zs28jN4Eaa	Tell your friend you like him! Talk to each other :P|`|AdL8Y4X1aa	well since shes your best friend i'm assuming she already knows that you really like this guy therefore you liked him first so you should go ahead and ask him out<br>  <br>  but if your friend never knew that you liked him, tell her that you've liked him for a long time and ask her if she would mind if u asked himout because u can't gethim off your mind<br>  <br>  if shes not really into him she'll understand but if she really likes him and so do you, then i suggest both of you just let him go and neither of you date him<br>  <br>  this way u get to still have your friendship with both of them , and trust friendships last way longer then relationships!

AA11349832	the question should be does she likes you and if she does and you are really good friends then she will say no, happend to me i asked my nest friend to be my gf but since we are really good friends she doesnt want to jeoperdice our friendship<br>  <br>  $hit happens and when it happens its nasty|`|COsBr4h2aa	Welll ok. <br>  1) get her #, her facebook, or myspce, aim, etc<br>  2) talk to her, get to know her better<br>  3) FLIRT with her. if at school, compliment her on her hair or shirt, or ask her to be ur partner in an activity<br>  4) her b-day coming up? surprise her with a gift<br>  5) ask her out!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  6) hug her<br>  7) call her beautiful instead of hot<br>  8) dont flirt with other girls<br>  <br>  And if you already are really good friends or u think she likes u, just go for it!!! But dont get a friend to, it makes it seem like a joke or that ur not "manly" enough. And heres some hints she likes you: when she looks across to the clock from across the room she glances at you, in the cafeteria at lunch she walks to the garbage can the same way you did (if you walked quick and spun on ur heel shell do the same w/out realizing it), and in a class u end up catching each others eyes<br>  <br>  :) good luck sir, and i hope i helped|`|LIFASlbIaa	Just tell her you like hr more than a friend and see if she says anything back if she likes you back ask her out on a date.|`|A7biMvrTaa	just ask her out on a date and while on the date you 2 have time to get to know each other a lot better and see what can happen from there|`|otmPmfNIaa	I have the same problem.

First ask her out to a movie or something as friends, get to know her better, and let her know you better, then slowly make your way up. But if she dousen't feel the same way about you, then stop hitting on her|`|EyJlCH0Naa	If you don't know...she won't be your girlfriend.<br>  <br>  Seriously, go up to her and tell her how you fell...why do you need yahoo answers for that?|`|IrABbSLoaa	aww, Willy, you should really just ask her out.<br>  Take a chance, what have you got to loose :]|`|NDoyhCZYaa	First open your mouth, then use your voice box, and say the following words in this exact order:<br>  <br>  "Will you be my girlfriend?"|`|OSnmnuQPaa	You could ask her directly on a date :) Alot of girls like the direct approach (Take it from me lol, I'm a girl!) or you could ask a friend to ask her out for you.

My bf has been divorced now 7yrs and he still talks about the X wife and what she did to him...i am always having to hear about her and its annoying as crap.

Bad enough for him to ignore you and speak harshly with you?<br>  <br>  He's probably over you, especially if he has a new girlfriend (you're probably the last thing on his mind except for when you text him, in which you become the annoying crazy stalking ex-girlfriend.)<br>  <br>  So what if he bought you an engagement ring?<br>  Maybe he's just lost all interest in you after you did 'some things'<br>  He probably just doesn't like you.|`|oPxssbHfaa	Some people deal with things in different ways, perhaps, if you did hurt him, he wants to just forget about the bad things and move on.

This is why 80% of ppl who file from divorce are women. <br>  <br>  Because the women don't work hard on purpose and live a relaxed life of leisure from not working hard, and then they use their looks to find a man who HAS to work hard to eke and scrape together a life for himself and who is successful and rich or upper middle class. A woman is entitled to what a man earns even though the women doesn't put in the time to work hard like the man does, but the spoils of the man's hard work and time is equal to the wife, which is fine unless the woman decides on her own to divorce (like Linda Hogan who only married Hulk Hogan for her money). <br>  <br>  It's easier to marry and everything is all marital property rather than earn everything yourself. After all, everybody only has one life to live, who wants to spend it working and studying. Why not use your looks to have somebody DO IT FOR YOU!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  IF YOU WANTED TO BE WITH ANOTHER MAN....WHY DID YOU GET MARRIED!!!!!!!

You have more than one kid, you should pay more.<br>  <br>  You and your overbearing family create a larger burden on society and the environment, you should be taxed for that too.<br>  <br>  You need a larger home to raise your brats in, and a freaking SUV to drive them around in, you should be taxed for that too.  Not to mention that the years between getting their drivers license and when they finally leave, (if more cars are purchased for them) they'll be taking up more public parking- they should be taxed for that as well.<br>  <br>  I could go on for hours.

You want to have those little rays of sunshine in your life. No problem, but YOU have to pay for them (just like I want my home/car/vacations). The rest of us already pay to support them through school taxes etc etc. <br>  I agree, it's just a traditional American ideal.|`|JwNZ7kK5aa	Are you crazy? Your life will be so much easier without kids or marriage.

She's worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Do you think you would ever even hear the name Oprah if she had kids and got married?|`|tCI8ksvdaa	In case you haven't noticed the government makes it difficult for anyone to become successful!  And the government is making that harder each day.|`|QilfSBfsaa	Government encourage people to have children because these children are also the tax payers after they grow up.  If everyone has no children, who is going to pay for social security money?|`|2zKBJkM8aa	The gov encourages familes because that is apart of the American Ideal.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	cheat on your taxes. that's what i do.|`|BLPBzpyUaa	I'm going to give you two answers: the short one and the long one.<br>  <br>  The short answer to your question is that the United States government is pro-natalist; meaning that it is the policy of the government to encourage reproduction and therefore incentives are given to this end such as tax credits and deductions.<br>  <br>  The long answer is that the tax benefits you will attain from reproduction are minute compared to the cost of raising children.  This is part of that reason that many Americans (myself included) are electing to not have children.  In an educated industrial society, children are not neccessary for survival; they are merely an expensive hobby.  Those who have children tell me there will be consequences to not having them such as tax benefits; the funny thing is that I've been too busy partying in Las Vegas, backpacking in Japan, and fishing to notice.
Q7ALl9zeaa	Your mom has some very intense hormone issues, and they should be addressed by you talking to your dad so he can ask her to see a dr. They might get worse and she could really lose it one day, hurting herself, you or someone else. Let's face it, she can't enjoy feeling so angry and uptight...especially if she isn't normally like that. Unbalanced hormones can cause some real distress in the body, but it is easy to fix with a visit to the dr, as long as she is honest about the effects of it. I have seen women go crazy due to menopause and hormone issues...but it does NOT have to be that way. If she is ok now, this is the time to do it..before it's that time of the month again. If your dad isn't the type to bring it up for discussion...outright tell him he doesn't have much choice because it rip the family apart eventually. I am sorry you have to go through this, good for you for letting others know and seeking help. Hang in there and good luck. I have added a couple sites you can read and share with your dad and or mom if you wish.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/premenstrual-syndrome/DS00134" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/premens...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.womenshealthchannel.com/pms/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.womenshealthchannel.com/pms/i...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/premenstrual_syndrome/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicinenet.com/premenstrual_...</a>|`|AA10209966	It sounds like your mother is frustrated and angry and is need of some psychiatric help, perhaps you should speak to your father privately and see if he can convince her to see a doctor. She probably needs meds. for P.M.S. also.|`|i9nlUZb0aa	I believe that you should talk with dad and tell him how you feel and what your feeling.

What is your dad doing about this?<br>  <br>  This is child abuse and she needs to speak to a doctor. I am a teacher by the way.<br>  <br>  Please speak to your dad about this. Also speak to your school counsellor and ask for help. <br>  <br>  Show your parents what you wrote and the replies you got. She is mentally bullying and abusing you.<br>  <br>  At your tender age this is just bang out of order.<br>  <br>  Period problems are NOT an excuse. It sounds she has mental problems. Also she may be jealous of you. <br>  <br>  She needs to be put in her place-she needs to act as a mother, not a child.<br>  <br>  Yanking you?

Just sit down with her (when she is in a good mood) and tell her how much you love her but that her behaviour is getting you down and that it scares you. Are in secondary school? If you are then you could see a councillor in your school for some advice.

Tell him about how it affects you and ask him how he feels about it. Chances are, he is growing tired of it as well. Ask him to have a talk with her regarding this, heart to heart. <br>  <br>  Your mother needs to visit her family doctor, who may be able to give some treatment for the symptoms that are creating her moods. First she needs to realize how deep this problem is becoming.|`|DQkDQraOaa	Talk to your dad about this. He should not be allowing her to abuse you when she is on her period or any other time. And abusing you is exactly what she is doing. If that doesn't help, try to avoid her as much as possible during that time. When it's over, ask her why she acts that way towards you. It may give her something to ponder.

You have to ignore him completely for a month or so .  you have to keep the distance from him for month or so . He think you are his wife and easily available to him. So you have to become very bold now to achieve your target.  If he ask any thing respond him in a way he gives to you. You just make a discipline schedule of your life . Go every day for exercise/jogging/walking ,do yogas,  take nutritious diet.<br>  Make your self very spicy/charming by wearning attractive dress, take care of your face and body very well . Wear revealing dress at bed time but don't ask him for love and any thing . A smile should be always on your face .If he comes and try to make  relationship with you , turn down his request very politely pretending one reason to another reason. So if you ignore him and pretend yourself very happy and make yourself more spicy and charming, he will compelled to think the reason behind it. If he has love for you may feel jealous. If he feel jealous means you have acheived the target. he will be after you if you ignore him completely for a month or so.<br>  Divorce is not the solution of your problem. This is a challenge for you and you have to accept it and show that you are capable to  cope withall sort of  problems come in life with your strong mental and will power. <br>  So you have to take tough decision  to mend the ways of your spouse and betterment of your married life. <br>  I pray from almighty god that your all dreams may turn into reality.<br>  Wish you all the best.|`|aNipRfrXaa	If you are wanting to save your marriage then sounds like you still love him.

But he feels it difficult to practise. So tell him that you will help him to improve by adopting any method whether he likes or not. Put off all lights early and tell him to sleep.  Set alarm at schedule time to wake him  up and make him get up forcibly.  dont hesitate tio be rude and harsh. It is in his and also in your interest.

FeEU1IDOaa	G-spot O's means g-spot orgasm. They're pretty rare. <br>  <br>  First, you should stop trying to make her orgasm by just intercourse. It's most likely not going to happen. Most women need clitoral stimulation, and lots of it, JUST the right way, to "get off". If you want to get better at it, just take direction from her. Ask her what she likes. Make sure you're not being too rough or too gentle. Watch what she does with her "toy" if she will let you, and try to do what she does. Don't think that you should automatically just know what she likes...every woman is different! You need to ask her.|`|01a19d2b8982bebcfca1b5520fa5d1e1aa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-spot" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-spot</a>  <br>  G spot Orgasms explained courtesy of Wikipedia.. thank goodness !|`|KmC0K59taa	It means a g-spot orgasm.

5dd9437d2887d5800d393adb8a4b516faa	Emily Posts rules are so old school, especially if you do not have a reception card!  We put black tie optional on ours and I have seen it on all of my cousins invites.  It is definitely the best way to get across that you want it formal.  <br>  <br>  This dress allows those who wish to go all out and dress in black tie to do so, but provides leeway for those who wish to dress a little less formally. This option means that men who don't own or want to rent a tuxedo need not feel compelled to do so. Men can opt to wear a dark suit instead of a tuxedo, but a black, dark navy, or dark grey suit would be the best choice. Men should dress as formally as they can, short of actually wearing a tuxedo. Women can dress as formally as black tie, but can also get away with a shorter, cocktail style dress. (taken from weddingchannel.com)|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Emily post says that you don't put it on the invite, but you can put it on one of the cards included in the invite-such as information about the location of the ceremony. It is supposed to be in the lower left hand corner.|`|LAXbJfvwaa	I have to agree that it would be much easier to say either cocktail or black tie - one or the other.  However - saying that, I also agree that some people can't afford to rent tuxes and you don't want them to feel left out.  For our wedding (and my cousin's too) we had 'lounge suit' written as the attire.  I feel that it was a basically cocktail dress - maybe a little more formal than cocktail - without being as formal as tuxes and gowns.  But if you want to put Black Tie Optional then that is fine also.  (P.S.  Why can't you write that it is 'formal'?  I have seen that done and do not think it is tacky.)|`|gfEQbww0aa	Do not put optional either have black tie or cocktail. When an invitation says optional it really means, you'd better have a gown on or you'll look out of place. So just go with black tie if its a formal event, so you don't leave the guests wondering. It's less tacky.

But here I can mention only one point that is believe in relations and do respect the relations you may find something good.

gfHutvEFaa	Nope it isn't right. She should at the very least sit down somewhere "neutral" and talk about what to do next.<br>  <br>  Write her a letter or phone her one more time, if she doesn't respond I would go and speak to a lawyer.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|PUXmTrnMaa	The hard part here is that we are only hearing one side of this story, yours. With that in mind all I can say is that regardless of what the issues are, you are married and have an obligation to each other. Unless you are truely a threat to your wife you have more right over her than her father. If you are a threat then she needs a restraining order, without it she or her father can not deny you from seeing your wife.<br>   If it has been five months which I agree with you is rediculouse, and she has no intention to talk and work this out then I see you having no alternative other than to play hard ball. If you love your wife and want to stay with her then I would march over there and tell her father that you want to talk to your wife and if he doesn't let you then you will involve the police (this is where your story has to be on the up and up) i would then get your wife in a private location where you can talk without being interupted and ask her to lay everything out to you. Ask her to tell you everything that is on her mind. YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO EVERY WORD WITHOUT ANSWERING!  As guys we are naturally terrible about not really listening to what our wives are trying to say. We always form an opinion or come up with an answer before they even finish talking. Hopefull after that you guys will be on he road to recovery. <br>   One thing is certain, she either needs to come home so you two can comunicate or start divorce proceedings.|`|m81dfyOYaa	No, it isn't reasonable or right that your wife won't speak to you. And, if you truly don't know why she left you have the right to know so that you can discuss it and work on the issues. Call her parents house, insist that you talk to her and suggest meeting for coffee. If that doesn't work send her a letter.  If you haven't heard back in a couple of weeks go see a lawyer, it's over. Good Luck.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Regardless of her probably shallow and baseless reasons for leaving, you need to force her hand. 4 months of abandonment will get you off the hook for any alimony, so go ahead and file for divorce so the ball will be in her court. Make sure you send her everything that belongs to her so she will have as little ground to stand on. If it was a week, I'd say offer to go to counseling. Four months is grounds for instant marriage disolvement in my book.|`|hhL1G3Ofaa	Confront is the wrong word.  You need to discuss what is going on in your relationship so you know exactly where the both of you stand.  If there is hope for your marriage, you need to seek some type of counseling.  There are always 3 sides to a story:  Yours, Hers, and the Truth.  Why would someone just up and leave their marriage for no reason.  Do some soul searching and then try to talk to your wife---No need for confronting her because that will only upset her and make the situation worse.  Good Luck!!!|`|FewhKlx9aa	Contact an atty she obviously does'nt want to married to you any longer and I think there is more to this that you saying|`|AA10736285	Check with local law enforcement to see what options you have and that you don't violate any court orders<br>  <br>  Don't look at it as your right but as a matter of satisfying your curiosity.

For whatever reason, she has made it clear she doesn't want any contact.  You are not in limbo.  You are merely sitting around waiting for her to tell you how your life should go from here forward.

And when your friend who started all this tries to befriend you again tell her to kiss your  a--, cause she is nothing but trouble and you don't need here in your life. Cause if she can do it to you once she can do it to you again.

GO FOR IT.|`|0TuWYaneaa	Hurts so good.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	The first time can be painful when the hymen breaks upon penetration. There can also be some blood. Not all girls bleed and not all have pain. I never bled but there was a lot of pain. <br>  <br>  The hymen is the thin membrane that sometimes covers the opening to the vagina if you're a virgin. Even if you haven't had sex, the hymen can do a bit of a disappearing act due to an overzealous workout at the gym, horseback riding, tampons, and even passionate "heavy petting" with your boyfriend. (It's not an impenetrable barrier, anyway, as it has holes to allow menstrual blood to escape.) <br>  <br>  For some, the first few times might make you feel sore, as the vagina has been an unused muscle or even hurt if you aren't properly lubricated, or if the guy is in a hurry, doesn't arouse you and your body isn't ready. <br>  <br>  Relaxing, foreplay, (oral sex, more foreplay – touching, kissing, etc) being fully aroused or better yet, you having an orgasm FIRST or using a lubricant like KY-Jelly or Astro-Glide can help.|`|eOgHbhHxaa	sex most liely will hurt the first time.<br>  but it might not.<br>  it really depends.<br>  the reason why sex hurts the first time is because you're tearing your hymen, or "popping your cherry." but you don't always pop your cherry when you have sex. it could tear by putting in a tampon or even riding  bike.<br>  don't worry about it, because it will pass.<br>  it may sting a little bit when you pee, but the pai should be gone within a day or so.|`|wDisAke1aa	Let him finger you first.

Pain or discomfort during the first time a woman has vaginal sex have three common reasons: the inexperience or lack of attentiveness of her partner, the fact that she may be too young and her body isn't ready, and the stretching open of her hymen.To Make it less painful just relax and foreplay (sexual activity before penile-vaginal sex). As a woman becomes sexually aroused, more blood flows into her genitals (this is also true for men). For a woman, this increased blood flow allows her vaginal canal to lengthen and widen. It also stimulates the production of vaginal lubrication. All these changes allow insertive sex to be more comfortable.The most important key is communication. Let your partner know what is comfortable and what is not comfortable. Encourage him to take his time<br>  <br>  <br>         -Hope This Helps|`|ETV7yvNbaa	I've never had sex before, you should know. I know a lot about it though. I know it will hurt the first time, something called the hymen will break. But it will be natural after that, so I say go for it! You have to have a first time, and I hear it's not that bad when you really like the person because you aren't really thinking about the hurting.|`|6Rru2901aa	It hurts a little the first time. (Be prepared 'cause there will be a little bleeding! - I didn't know :( )<br>  <br>  The second time you may be a little more confortable and it might hurt a lil less, By the third you should be fine, but it's different for everyone of us, so it could be by the second or third.<br>  <br>  If it's possible on the first time for you guys to foreplay and he goes down on you! It's magical and may make it much easier for him when going in because you'd be wet!!! :)<br>  <br>  Best luck!!<br>  <br>  Moe|`|AA12363623	Most of the pain I experienced was from the tension. If you can relax, it shouldn't be all that bad. Though the hymen may or may not play a role, depending on whether you have one or how much of one you have. <br>  <br>  It took me a while to let go of all the tension. I didn't start enjoying sex until about the 6th time because I just could not relax. I expected pain, so I became tense and the tension caused it. Self defeating prophesy. If you can relax and go into it without expecting pain, it will be much easier (though that in itself is much easier said than done).|`|1a706718a4b83f6f555a5f56b16c07a6aa	The first time will not be so good.  There are both physical and emotional issues.  Like most things, the more you practice, the better you get.  I would caution you that there will be some emotional baggage after the fact that you should expect.  Also, and not to sound square, but 'GOOD' men very much prefer to marry 'GOOD GIRLS '.  And I emphasize 'GOOD MEN'. That is a fact that was true 100 years ago, and will still be true 100 years from today.  My advice would be to look five or ten years down the road, and try to understand how the consequences of your actions today, will affect your life in the future.  Come hell and high water, protect yourself from both pregnancy and disease.  Both will wreck your life.  I wish you the best.|`|FzdRrgMqaa	I wont lie to you.<br>  I was in the same situation as you!<br>  I recently lost my virginity to about two months ago.<br>  My boyfriend and I are doing long distance so we've probably have had sex about 7ish times now.<br>  And the last time we had it it still hurt me.

And with the same boyfriend I have now, we're planning on having sex again pretty soon, and I'm scared too.

Talking to him will go a long way to help you win him over. If he sticks around to talk to you then you are succeeding. Listen to what he saying. Laugh at his jokes even if some are corny. He is probably shy about meeting girls and you just may win his heart.r|`|oVcXGsTOaa	he cant feel anything he doesnt want to feel. you cant MAKE him fancy you. he does, or he doesnt - simple. dont look for love. let love find you.|`|O5CIDWqfaa	Just be nice to him and talk to him.

Good-luck|`|uIWSJYa7aa	depending on were you live there might be apartments were you can rent them for like a month or two for free and then you have to pay, but you should probably try and get a job anywhere,<br>  if its possible try and stay with a friend for a while, and have a job at the same time, so you can get your own place<br>  good luck|`|LLnNjH94aa	If you're in the US call the police and tell them that your parents are neglecting you.  They can't kick you out until you're 18.|`|oKEkKhd4aa	Oh my God!  Why the heck did they kick you out?? They must be horrible parents.  I feel so bad for you.  My advice is to stay with a really close friend and his/her family|`|35AfY6gTaa	a close friend, or if you have any relatives in town.  are you sure they are kicking you out forever though?  or are they just pissed and making you leave for two or three days?  if it's forever that's against the law, unless they have stated a new place you need to go, which they obviously haven't<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   go to the police.  their threat is probably an empty threat.  and its not your fault you have MS, so why are they mad???|`|MMIrGwDAaa	ur bf, ur bffs, grandparents, aunts, cousins?

Sorry to hear you've been kicked out. Where are you asking this question from right now?<br>  <br>  Do you have any family local to where you are or friends who would offer you a safe place to sleep until you sort things with your parents or find somewhere permanet?<br>  <br>  Youth hostels are often a good idea. There must be local authorities that will help you out.<br>  <br>  Don't sleep outside. Your young, people will understand.<br>  <br>  Take care of yourself xxx|`|5y5h5VYIaa	Friends.<br>  Because if you go to the cop it's going to make your life a living hell anyway.

y9CgveCGaa	I think you just have to tell him.  Do it after he's had a couple of drinks.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Just tell him.  No easy way out of this.|`|521041d52a46b112c25727367e1164beaa	i guess my main question is did you do anything to prevent a pregnancy, tubes tied, vasectomy, etc? if you did then there might be some questions...if you didn't you just need to tell him. I mean you can't change the past, it's done now. You were meant to have 3 children. Congratulations.|`|41skve2Yaa	You don't have much choice.  I think the sooner the better.   Just out with it.|`|JaeIZZKRaa	Just tell him the truth. It will work out.|`|CBbsulYCaa	don't tell him .... then he will never find out!!|`|dFUqPcWKaa	Well sooner or later he's going to figure it out, so you might as well tell him now and get it over with.<br>  <br>  And, if the two of you decide again that you don't want anymore children, agree on a form, or several different kinds, of birth control.|`|ufOSDnetaa	i just wanna say when my belly was bigger than i thought it should be...i found out i was pregnant with twins...either way, it's a blessing. it happened, he'll get over it
qGVAvefSaa	well just smiling n hearing wt he says is a good move <br>  if u think u two r good for each others then try to talk to him by askin him few simple questions like how r u today or i didnt know ur name yet simple questions n he will do the rest <br>  <br>  good luck|`|gTjtaG0Faa	next time say "I bet you say that to all your customers" he either will smile and allude to big tips or he will say you are the only ray of sunshine blah blah blah which means you go from there.<br>  Small chit chat but you let him steer the conversation either to safer waters or the more adventurous.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I think this is shameful for a married woman to be asking!|`|dFUqPcWKaa	I agree with a previous answer, he's prooooobably looking to get a good tip. I'm not saying you're not beautiful, but sometimes it's easier to get a good tip when you're being honest, haha.|`|6GFKXsCGaa	He's either interested or just out-right CREEPY!! If you are interested in him, then go for it....ask him out to coffee or something simple, if the vibes flow then you'll know it!! Best of luck!!!
QHJoFyfUaa	I would say to find a good time and place to talk to him. Find a time when he's not busy, so he can definitely hear you out. Either that, you could write a note and stick it in his locker. If he's a great guy, then either way, he'll listen to you. :) Good luck!|`|ReCy0Omxaa	Make a move....like kissing him randomly...I think he'll get the message!|`|75Xj9yhmaa	I think the best way to tell him is to say somewhere along the lines of "we've spent so much time together and i really like you" or you could change it, just make sure it doesn't sound too cheesy, or he might get freaked out. And if if says "I like you too" then HIP HIP HOORAY! :)<br>  BUT,<br>  if he doesn't and says something like "sorry i don't feel like same way as you do" or he may look like he's disgusted and doesn't like you back, quickly say "It's okay if you don't like me the way i like you, we can still be friends. Just pretend this conversation never happened". (:<br>  It might be weird for a while, but if you guys are really good friends, I'm sure the confession you made didn't break your friendship! :D <br>  GOOD LUCK :)|`|NVdf3uAEaa	invite him out to like a street fair, or the movies, or ice skating... i don't know something you both like to do. <br>  and show him how nice, and cool you are.|`|nn39PpUyaa	Tell him you think he's "kinda" attractive and see what his response is. If he blushes or says something similar then I guess you could tell him.|`|0xp9Oobnaa	usually guys will always make the first move on the girls, to ask them out. just give him a small sign that you want to go with him.
BLOcQtCTaa	Tell them that your midterm is on final and you need to get a good grade on it so you can pass the class and its very important to you. promise them that after you take your midterm that you can hang out with them. If they still keep bothering you trying to convince you then idk ..i guess they dont really care about whats more important to you. They should understand. <br>  <br>  Good luck on your midterm!!!!!|`|wnjvvRiqaa	b calm and tell her again that u will b back with them spending all the time if u cud clear the exams.. and that if they could help you in some way!|`|0mHEhjYcaa	First off, I understand how important Exams can be, and I also now how important friendship can be. It's always good to make time for your friends no matter what you have going on, not only is it good for your friendship, but it's also good for you to take a break from studying. Studies actually show that over-studying can increase your risk of failing and not taking in, and learing the material, and taking breaks completey unrelated to your studying (like going to the mall) can actually really help your capacity to learn the material and do well in your studies. It sounds to me like your friends understand the need to get out and do something, and take a break, and like you said you've been busy and haven't made any time to hang out with them, so can you blame them for being persistent in wanting to spend time with you? I'm sure they completely respect what you need to do, since it sounds like over the past few weeks they have let it go easy, and it shows that they are actually really smart and good friends to actaully get you away from studying for a while and to spend quality time with them. If you made an effort to make more time for your friends, then you probably wouldn't have to worry about them being persistent again. It sounds like your friends are making all the effort, maybe you could meet them halfway. The time that you spent writing this ( and obviously not studying) you could have been spending time with your friends. Just remember the Lord has blessed you with the joy of friendship, be careful not to abuse it. good luck, and God Bless!!
ry3bsIukaa	Aww, I think the best thing is to move on. It sounds like she got freaked when you "told her your secrets". And if she went and spread lies to your friend and another girl, she doesn't sound like someone you could be able to trust in any case. Good Luck!|`|EehmyeWWaa	Start taking to her, ask her if she wants to hang out sometime... if you hang out sometime then just confess it and say 'heyy i think you're a really nice girl, i REALLY like you. :)|`|Blg13fmvaa	I'm asking the same question in my head.<br>  This boy name Yusuf, he flirts with me, but I don't know if he likes me, coz I like him.<br>  Well, talk to her.<br>  Put a message saying: "I like you" "Guess who?"<br>  In her locker or bag.<br>  Try not to get caught.<br>  <br>  If the girl thinks that someone else wrote it, then say it was you.<br>  ok<br>  Best advice I have given!
QMAqzpKEaa	Maybe she has issues from the past. It sounds like she may have suffered abuse in some form at some point in her life.<br>  I suggest that she goes to her doctor. Perhaps you could accompany her and give her moral support. Was she a virgin when you got together?<br>  Why do you not feel passion towards her. <br>  You say that she is in love with you but you never said that you are in love with her.<br>  It is a relationship but you are making it sound more like a business partnership. <br>  I had a problem letting go with one of my exes. I thought that it was my problem and that it might be to do with my past. I even went to the doctor, who referred me to a sexual psychiatrist.<br>  About 3 years later, I met someone else and the sex was great. I guess that although I told the previous ex that I loved him and had convinced myself that I loved him I did not. I must have loved my ex because the sex was good.<br>  Sometimes, girls are just in love with the idea of being love. You say she is 24. She is still quite young and prone to being fanciful and more romantic (less of a realist) at that age.|`|Po2UqfvWaa	she wants more than just sex. that's what a relationship is. it includes many things. she many never be into the full blown sex all the time deal. it seems to me that what you need to do is always take the first step. a lot of foreplay too. good luck|`|yFGfucRXaa	try to experiment. let her take the lead.|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Use more lube.|`|OuXnOkZuaa	Yea: but usually sex..even if awkward at first is very wild and passionate if you are in a new relationship...It was awkward with my man and I at first we were young..but then it was awesome and Fun...But I am 21 and don't know what its like for a 24 year old woman...hmmmm maybe she is not feeling totally secure yet is why she has not let herself go...but wants you to feel that its not you..its her insecurity that she will probably get over....Good Luck|`|AA11922229	And you buy that story?|`|4YxuxEIOaa	Its still a little early. you need to find out what really turns her on in bed... be a little more passionate with her, tell her to do things to you, tell her how good it feels to be inside her etc etc. make the sex work for you. try doing sexy things together, massaging her, teasing her with foreplay, going down on her and driving her wild. it will (excuse the pun) come eventually.|`|rg1OpthBaa	If you two love each other than you need to talk and communicate in the bedroom. have her tell you what you are or are not doing and you do the same. Maybe sex is just not important to her and she just loves being with you. there is no problem with that. but you have to communicate man. that is the only way things will get better.|`|oIsW8FnFaa	well umm you have to be in a realtionship to have sex so then its not akward and wait untill like the middle of the realation ship.|`|TsQumtCLaa	yes ...it wont be long and their will be whips and chains
TAdQsVrsaa	what she sais is true, you shuld like her for who she is and not dislike her jus bcos she does sum things that you dont like. everyone has good points and bad points but you learn 2 love them for who they are and take the good wiv the bad. if you do rele like this girl and decide to be her boyfriend then maybe your dislike for smoking and drinkin may rub off on her and she may not do it as much because it will upset you. jus go with the flow and just see how it goes|`|24aa8ef00e60cd021ba919036bf14330aa	Honestly, I wouldnt go out with that kind of girl<br>  First she asked u to be her BF which is kinda demeaning<br>  She smokes,drinks, weed possibly u said<br>  U have nothng in common<br>  Besides she cant force u to like her by saying "u should lke me for who i am". it's kinda like she's tryna blackmail u wth guilt in a way so dont fall for dat. Afterall u dont love her for who she is, just be honest and dont deceive her. She cant force u, go out with her if u like her or just let her know u just wanna be friends|`|xUZh6Ag8aa	well..she should be a bit more understanding.. but shes right..<br>  shes young, and living life how she wants to.. take her how she is and hope she grows out of it.. or just leave her be.<br>  good luck..x|`|0ejfWPytaa	that is true you should like her for who she is .. i totaly agree with that.. but relly ya can not trust a girl who does all those things.. in my opinion i wud tell her that she needs to stop the weed....and try cut down on the drinking and stuf if she really wants to be with you she will do it ... <br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps :D|`|cILIQBG3aa	if she's not prepared to make sacrifices in life them she isn't the one... she has many years ahead of still doing those things and won't give them up til she has had her fun. it will be a long while till she grows up im afraid so i wouldn't count on it. find someone genuine and be happy =)
sBm95Us4aa	Are you sure he really doesn't like you. Maybe try to ask a friend to find out, he might be shy or unsure. Look and see if he treats you different than other girls.
Ivg9nEDVaa	bebo says I need to be one of your friends, which apparently I am not currently.  So blindly I'll say that the one in the middle is pretty good looking, but the one on the left is smokin'.

cggkcAC5aa	let him know that you like him, if you dont, he will never know. One night you can say something like, "I want to tell you something, but there's a possibility it might make things weird between us. Can I tell you?" If he says yes, then say, "I really like you as a friend, but I've really started to like you as more than a friend. I'm not expecting a response because I know it might make you feel awkward, especially if you don't feel the same way. I also don't want to put you on the spot because I don't want to ruin our friendship. But I just wanted you to know in case you do feel the same way." I hope this helped. It would be nice if you could help me with mine too<br>  =]<br>  <a href="http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306155431AAlnTBs&r=w">http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|angW1Lkfaa	If you know he's a player forget it more then likely he will break your heart.|`|A1hfquASaa	Make yourself more noticeable than those other girls. Talk to him and make great conversations. Guys like funny girls so you should make him laugh. Then he will like you even more and it will all work out.... :D|`|xOf2OUJkaa	wat you need to do is send him a text saying do you like me if he says yes hes all yours but you must keep this a secret from the girls that like him they'll spread a stupid rumor about you and the boy and he'll brake up with you|`|sR0pOtqjaa	I think you should at least give him a chance, if things go well, then great ... otherwise if you caught him cheating then it's over ...
G7OVlkqzaa	I am in the exact same situation as you currently.<br>  <br>  All the advice I have gotten from my friends is to just tell him. That's really the only way you would know.<br>  <br>  If he's shy, it's more likely he won't make a move first, even if he does like you. So it's best you just go for it, or you might lose the opportunity.
zzaScg0haa	Try something else
gRXy66dOaa	call him a dork<br>  thats wat my GF calls me
dckhOavsaa	Well that's an easy one- other girls hate us so much because you guys love us so much!

ALSO....i hate girls who die there hair blond for attention! and get a life!|`|JCGckRu6aa	I don't see the hype with blondes. Everyone just assumes that all blondes are good-looking; and they are not. There are many nice looking blondes, and many ugly ones; just like any other hair colour.|`|uhKBBQ9raa	:o I don't hate blonds, I just hate air-headed people, and sometimes there's a coincidence that they're blonds, but they can be brunettes too.<br>  And that's sad, you're just asking for the number of blond girls, not brunnettes or red heads. That's stupid, intelect and sympathy doesn't get defined by the hair color. <br>  And probably you won't get any number ;)|`|L8J5nNjDaa	other girls hate blondes, cause blondes are usually very hott! and the stereotype about blondes being stupid is wrong! cause not all blondes are like that.|`|UhHMgKbkaa	bc blondes have more fun baby!!<br>  other girls are just jealous cuz we get all the guys =)|`|KcK8W40faa	cause we have more fun ;)<br>  <br>  no number but feel free to email me...|`|G4pmbc0Qaa	Stereotyping for the lose. Blondes are sometimes thought of as snobby or airheaded which isn't true in all or most cases. <br>  <br>  I'm brunette but I don't pay much attention to hair color really. I don't think anyone should, it's no indication of personality.<br>  <br>  And grow up, would you? :]|`|MuSYw7m3aa	screw you man if all you want is a girl with blond hair youll obviosuly get NO ONE because no girl wants to date an asshole who just likes girls for their hair colour. and maybe they dont "hate" blondes they just care more about more things then HAIR|`|SfvfPpwKaa	I don't hate anybody because of their hair color.

WDs4fRoxaa	Your mom needs to tell her that she has to go to rehab or get out.<br>  <br>  She is not going to hear any other words.<br>  <br>  A strong ultimatum of such magnitude might make her listen.<br>  <br>  If she says she will leave...she might, but she will be back.<br>  <br>  She is out of control, and could get seriously hurt by going<br>  with strangers for alcohol.<br>  <br>  Your mom has to take this seriously.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|nOrWOZU4aa	The AlAnon is a good answer.  You cannot help her, sorry to say.  You could also not help in helping her drink (lending money, etc). Alcholics just don't realize they have a problem, it is really bizzare, alcohol helps you justify all your bad behavior.|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	The best suggestion I can give you is to call AlAnon which is a support group for families of alcoholics. They can give you advise & support on how to approach her and also how to not let it ruin your life as well. An alcoholic must make the decision on their own to quit or to seek help. As you've seen, talking to her doesn't work and she laughs it off. She probably doesn't consider herself to be an alcoholic, and if she's not one yet it sounds like she's on her way to becoming one with the company she keeps. If she's still living at home with you and your Mom, the one thing your Mom could do is to not allow alcohol in the house. Of course, then you have to be worried about where she is and if she's driving under the influence. It's a tough thing to deal with a situation like this. I have a friend who's an alcoholic and we've tried everything to help. The bottom line is the first step is for the person with the problem to recognize there's a problem and start talking about it then seek help for the addiction. In the meantime, you & your Mom should at least call AlAnon & try to get some support for yourselves. Good luck to all of you.
zLnerUqqaa	yea he probably just needs some time to himself y'all have been together for a long time after he gets himself together, if he still loves you he will probably ask you back out don't worry|`|SV0LZWUiaa	oh boy thats the chance of antartica in the equator.  sorry for being pessimistic.|`|ODblt2gTaa	it means that you two have grown apart..|`|3ROdgg8Taa	he obviously is confused and going through that confusion stage of guys where they are unsure of what they want. he is acting like a fool right now. don't give in. just let him be and hang out with others. you will get over him trust me! I had this guy i really liked and he liked me but ofund it awkward so i said w/e this isn't worth the pain so i moved on. You'll do the same. Forget this problem and smile.|`|fc6bFYHvaa	It means he can't be gay with you since you aren't a guy.

L2mJmZDtaa	Wait until you are more mature (not embarrassed by your body) and you find somebody else who is mature who will understand that every anatomy is different.|`|OauZKhKVaa	Don't worry about it! Every woman has different anatomy, and odds are if he's relatively experienced, he's been around labia of all different shapes and sizes. Don't judge the way you look based on what you've seen in magazines or online, because most of those pictures are airbrushed and super unrealistic. He'll be much more at ease and you'll both have more fun if you're confident about the way you look!|`|w5DmFiojaa	you said your not going to have sex but, when it starts to feel really good you want he's pennis inside you. then you will get pregnant. my advice is dont do it! whats wrong with you.
r9lfDeRmaa	It is perfectly normal for ANY guy to be aroused by kissing and cuddling.<br>  <br>  Why? because their heart starts racing, blood starts flowing to various parts of the body, fantasy and imagination kick in.|`|6Tj70Xv5aa	It's completely normal. Just animal instinct. His body thinks he's gonna get laid, to put it simply.|`|oU3c8U3Gaa	Yes, it's normal young men are more prone to get excited than older more experienced men.
nJ9lGMmQaa	I like both. Kissing my girlfriend's neck and chest really turns her on, so I get turned on. And it feels great when she kisses down my neck too! Ooo, shivers! :D|`|AKc8EaKTaa	i do it to my guy all the time, and he just rolls his eyes with pleasure. he loves it. if you love it, your guy will melt just the same|`|kRhsgZdnaa	CHICKY!<br>  if you like it he will have to LOVE it! i mean my boyfriend loves it! =]|`|FOWQ8d0Qaa	either way, tho i wish i had the chance to :(|`|AA10687516	Both...but that whole it's better to give than receive crap doesn't apply to intimacy...<br>  <br>  As a guy...nothing gets me going than when she is kissing on me.  It's a feeling of being wanted and being attractive.  And I promise if you do it to him, he'll happily reciprocate on command.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Vote for best Answer|`|tpioRQHkaa	i prefer a girl to do it to me. i think over 80% of guys prefer to do it to the girl|`|ZV9LBsMJaa	i would prefer both but then at the same time i love it when my girlfriend does it to me it really turns me on cause it shows that shes in to me.<br>  <br>  - kyle|`|TNjKwlA9aa	I could imagine that guys think it's sexy.

Has she been hanging out at someone's house she won't tell you about? Sounds shady to me. I'd be doing some investigating. Just don't get arrested for stalking.
NwpGhT31aa	I think so. One of my friends is really REALLY loud and outspoken. She is one of the most outgoing people I know.

I hate that this happens because it is so hard for both people. I am trully sorry that this happened to you, I know it has to hurt. I wish it was as simple as in time it will get better. Its not like that in a situation like this. You are going to have to go out with friends and try and not socialize with her as much. I know thats going to be very hard but the less you talk to her and the less you see her the more you will have more room in your life for someone else. Date around, LOL dont sleep around, just kidding but date different people. Go see what else is really out there and when you meet that one person thats going to change your life forever you will know. Everyone is meant for someone. I never believed that until I met the guy I am with now. I hope this was helpful.|`|WfnbN8ASaa	I have the exact same problem!!! I like one of my guy friends. He used to like me, but I didn't go for it at the time. It has been since like October. I am just now starting to get over him though I think. If you text her stop. Hang out with your friends. Write it all down sometimes it helps me. I know it sounds lame but I did it for this guy I wrote it all down about me liking him, why(and I dont even know why?), and anything else about him that ran across my mind. I do a lot of after school stuff so that keeps me re-occupied, and hang out with your friends. Try real hard to keep your mind off of them. I really hope this helps :)|`|Vj1VIqLcaa	try not to focus on it and ask questions about her...just keep busy and hang out with your friends. eventually you will find someone new and have a crush on that person.<br>  play a sport or do something else you like and focus on that! dont give your self to much time to think about that person and eventually you will stop with time|`|RsKOydnIaa	Dude, you should ask her to stay a bff or just ff maybe even an f.

c998b0820f5eab481123e2a3db854d7daa	i like mata better even tho im persian lol|`|MybJpwQlaa	You are totally getting mixed some mixed signals from Mata.  I know she's a really good friend, but it isn't usual for a girl to be hugging and kissing a guy who isn't her boyfriend or someone she doesn't like as more than a friend.  (I'm not saying it's impossible, just, not likely.)<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like Mata likes you.  If she's so open about her hugs and cheek kissing it seems like she's sort of marking you as her own.  It will be hard for another girl to try to approach you if Mata is always hugging you, you know?  It also sounds like you trust Mata a lot and you aren't opposed to the physical contact.  I think that you should go for Mata.  You guys are already good friends, and in the end a good girlfriend should also be a good friend.<br>  <br>  But, if you wanted to try to get to know Ghazelas better, you might want to tell Mata to stop with the public displays of affection!<br>  <br>  Good luck.  They both sound like nice girls.
BqVcz1R1aa	no, at first I thought you were talking bout random people on the street.  ha ha   just kidding...that would be odd. I like it when my girlfriend has her hands on her waist and when she moves her hips. its all bout the hips at first. then she tilts her head up and starts rubbing her chest with her finger, and she plays with her bra. you could also bend over with you butt in the air, and have your boobs hang out, and show cleavage. also look at guy magazines and the websites such as maxim or fhm and see how those women are posed.|`|l7g5JBEEaa	Lay on your side on your bed and look seductively into the camera bite on index finger with bottom lip slightly pushed down.

Well if you are one who wears from neck to toe fully covered in your business formal or chudidar kurta or kimono even then just twising a few hairs by your side of the face with your index finger and giving a lusty gaze at your man will provoke them.<br>  <br>  Being fully concealed makes men feel more provoked they feel such women were sexy when they get even a slight signal or glimpse of what they believe no one other than them might have had a chance to see.<br>  <br>  To me the sexiest post wear anything thats you intentionally carelessly wore to attract they eye that's seducing.<br>  <br>  Well if you wish to do it by icing with exposing in nudity! well you need to go completely nude and lustful eyes but still a man shouldnt be able to see your vitals or your n i p p l e s or  a s s h o l e , tease em.<br>  <br>  My favourite pose Sitting on my bed completely nude with myself fully waxed and my feet firm on the bed me clasping my thighs and my head rested on my knees. Well it looks too cute the man can see my full leg and my outer side upper thighs. My breasts are completely hidden as I lean and clasp my thighs but not my legs in the front. I embrace them so close and my chin rests cool on my knees. I have a great flowing and slightly wavy hair thats not too long or short while it adds to the seduction. I used maskara on my eyes and eyelining is too perfect to convey my message. on my body I applied good moisturizer to get the steamy feel. My room was all white with good white clean bed spread and all in white and grey tones. While I was the only one in wheatish creamy white figure on bed with naughty thoughts and lustful eyes ready to be undone! Just to be asked to lend my hand! That would be the most sexy pose. You see my legs are held close so that my inner thighs and any of my vital is never exposed!!!<br>  <br>  You know something my man did sex to me within minutes I showed him that snap of mine on my timer camera.

b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	As in all surgeries, there is a chance for bleeding to occur. A little is nothing to be overly concerned about here Mom. Now alot and alot constantly, then start to worry and head for the ER but no need to panic now. Your baby is just fine. I think Id be more concerned about the vomiting than the bleeding. Also your respons as a Mother is quite normal too. So relax before they have to take you to the ER.|`|pTlnCNYJaa	Seek another medical opinion to put your mind at ease. This is your baby and you can never be too careful.|`|WLLqdPXeaa	Have patience and faith in doctor and God. He will be alright. Best of luck. May God bless both of you!|`|yL3Qxsmaaa	because of the catheter it irritated his urinary tract.|`|li5YD9kmaa	Because of Catheter.<br>  My grandma had stroke and aneurism like 2 years ago. She was on catheter for at least 12 to 14mos. And i remember she used to bleed like tht.. <br>  its normal but if it bleeds worse than it can be infection or something around that area tht needs to be checked out. <br>  <br>  Possible causes and effects<br>  Common indications to catheterize a patient include acute or chronic urinary retention, orthopedic procedures that may limit a patient's movement, the need for accurate monitoring of input and output (such as in an ICU), benign prostatic hyperplasia, incontinence, and the effects of various surgical interventions involving the bladder and prostate.<br>  <br>  For many patients the insertion and removal of a catheter can cause excruciating pain, so a topical anesthetic should be used for patients of both sexes. Catheterization should be performed as a sterile medical procedure and should only be done by trained, qualified personnel, using equipment designed for this purpose. If correct technique is not used then trauma may be caused to the urethra or prostate (male), urinary tract infection may be caused or a paraphimosis may occur (male uncircumcised patient). Because of this it is important that any practitioner undertaking this procedure first is both trained and adequately supervised until they are able to demonstrate an approved level of competence.<br>  <br>  Complications of catheter use may include: urinary tract or kidney infections, blood infections (sepsis), urethral injury, skin breakdown, bladder stones, and blood in the urine (hematuria). After many years of catheter use, bladder cancer may also develop.<br>  <br>  <br>  Combating infection<br>  By indwelling (long-term) catheters it is very important to take everyday care of catheter and drainage bag. [2] To reduce risk of infection:<br>  <br>  Daily wash urethral area (area where catheter exits body) and catheter itself with intimate soap and water.<br>  Disconnect drainage bag from catheter only with soap-washed hands.<br>  Disconnect drainage bag as seldom as possible, only in necessary cases.<br>  Keep drainage bag connector as sterile as possible = do not touch connector by hands or by any other possible infectious surfaces (bed, cloths, floor...). If you are not sure that connector and end of catheter inside are sterile, wash them by soap and water, or use some antiseptic disinfection.<br>  If possible avoid disconnecting of drainage bag in hospitals - there is increased risk of antibiotic-resistant bacteria infection. For such cases carry small bottle with some kind of antiseptic to always be able to keep connector sterile.<br>  Cleanse your drainage bag periodically<br>  If possible use thin catheter to reduce risk to harm urethra during insertion of catheter<br>  Drink enough liquids to produce at least 2 liters of urine daily<br>  Before and after sexual activity clean carefully sexual organs of you and your partner, avoid contact of sexual organs to other not cleaned parts of body (e.g. anus). Sexual contact is especially for catheterized women very high risk to get urinary infection.<br>  <br>  Do not get scared like that you can have as much information you want anything, Online, libraries a lot of places. But also keep in mind not everything out there is true but what doctor advises you. certainly question him if he says something outside of your knowledge.<br>  Good Luck|`|AA11280073	I would ask to be referred to a specialist. I would be scared, too.

mmrcaoUzaa	Seriously, me and my best friend are exactly the same way. On and off all the time, it's completely annoying, both of us waiting around for the other one. But, if you get him alone on a one on one hang out and just do something normal like watch a good movie, especially one with a little bit of romance in it so at the part where the characters kiss, he'll get nervous and look at you. As long as you're still not with your boyfriend I say GO FOR IT ! Especially if he's as cute as my best friend, it's always the shy ones who are so awesomely cute and so hard to get. Haha, I really hope i works out for you, even though I ended up making the first move on him, if he really does like you, he will make the second, third and fourth. LOLZ! laterrrr <33|`|MRxm67DPaa	YEA! he dose come on it shows all the sighns alright well the thing is hes just shy but like he really does love u he shows all the sighns try to make a move on him shy ppl are really sweet so like u have to have patience and like help him out a lil like so that he can tell u how he feels ok but he DOES LIKE U! and u should be happy and call him back and tell him srry for lien that u just wanted to see what he would do like if he would really miss u and good luck alright but grul<br>  <br>  he does like u CONGRATEZ|`|9btcOpxXaa	Hell yeah he does.|`|m2eHPeciaa	well if he didn't like u, then he wouldn't call u. soo i think he likes u, but i dont think it was right to carry the lie on soo long as u did.
wck4MHREaa	Yeah, hell, it's hard for me to just open up to my friends! <br>  <br>  Its extremely hard for me to say "I love you" unless I mean it. I do mean it towards some people but in a brotherly, caring way. I would not have any idea what to do or how to say it towards someone I'm actually in love with. I have told girls that I've had romantic feelings towards them, but I've never been in love, and I wouldn't know what to say.|`|1ZExFF5Daa	It took me MONTHS to get the words "I love you" out to my boyfriend. :P So yeah, it can be hard sometimes.|`|GXoQbjbLaa	Only sometimes|`|HRQjffv8aa	Not really.. I mean if I like them I just act around them the same as I would normally act, and if they like me back then I know that they like me for who I really am not for words that I scripted or something.. and its a pain to think for so hard for every sentence your going to say to them. Though the words "I like you or "I love you" would always be hard to so especially at first.|`|JDC02N8waa	Yeah. LIke... it's only when I try to be funny though. Like normally I'm really good at being naturally funny but around him even though we're close friends I just can't be funny.

X4i2jej5aa	I think that hes annoyed because he probably knows you like him and he's scared that his girlfriend might get the wrong idea. I think you shouldn't text him as much and find someone else to talk to. I use to call my friend, who's the opposite gender almost everyday and he got really annoyed too. But then I decided that I need to give him some space and not talk to him for a while. A while later, he called me instead. So if maybe you stopped for a while, he might just be the one to text you next time.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Why not just ask him out and get it over with?|`|Fb3PMgD2aa	well 12345,  U just anoyed me by what u said,, BUT however I will say this.. <br>  <br>  BOBOM GAGA LOLO MIN, okey.. okey..|`|feb0df556be60b6ae1592e3a13327aedaa	Give him some space.|`|l8f8xCneaa	"how was ur day???"<br>  "whats up???"<br>  "hey"<br>  "watcha doin???"<br>  stuff like that<br>  or maybe tell him something weird that happened today|`|0ktcvglRaa	Buy him flowers!|`|0sI33S9Kaa	tell him|`|TZgVGcb8aa	Girl do you like him or something. If you do then that makes you the extra on a plate. I am telling you it doesn't matter what the subject is if he gets annoyed sometimes he telling you to stop bothering him. Hes not intersted in you and he has a GIRLFRIEND. Beside your making yourself look soo cheap. Why are you trying soo hard for someone who isn't intersted in you. Really, if you try too hard hes not going to be impressed k!! He is going to think your weird and if his girl find out....one word...DRAMA!! Just leave it really I don't think he is worth it and I don't think your easy. So stop portraying like you are.|`|kyAi1c8Xaa	Too be honost, the mere fact you like him && he in fact has a girlfriend makes texting him so much not a good thing by any means. <br>  If he gets annoyed just don't text him, I know it may be hard but try texting someone else or turning your phone off for a few hours.|`|iJeGjRTTaa	Leave him alone for a little bit--you're just going to have to refrain yourself from texting him for a while.

Let me tell you. There are tons of people out there that take advantage of people for one reason or another.  Choose your friends wisely. You are young and will make and lose many friends in your lifetime. You are probably going to believe lies of many other men in your life.  Sometimes when you like someone you just don't want to believe that they would lie to you, but that's life.  Learn that now.  I'm not saying never to trust anyone, but look the right places to find the ones you can.  Personally I don't believe Myspace is the place to do that. You can write anything about yourself, doesn't mean it's true.  Use your intuition about people.  You'll find that most of the time you are right. I would never talk to this guy again. He sounds like a controlling pedophile A hole!|`|a4p1Kvijaa	STEER WELL CLEAR OF HIM!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  that's my first pointer, my second is to remind you that you are still so young, i know it sounds so cliché but soon you will meet someone soooo much better.<br>  <br>  i would reccommend staying single for a little while at least, it helps to clear things up as you get to know yourself a little better and have a more objective view on men<br>  <br>  pls take my advice - i'm 22 so young enough to relate, but old enough to have been through things you shouldn't. i'm 'wiser' for it, for better or for worse - feel free to message me if you'd like more advice!! xxx|`|7CAUiE0taa	First of all your dating all the wrong guys, either you are attracting them to you somehow and you need to change your attitude, personality, or looks.

5iOHJHUzaa	I think that you are treading on unsafe territory seeing that he has a girlfriend. But are you absolutely sure he has one and are they still together? It really sounds like he likes you. So simply ask him if he has a girlfriend and if he says yes, then ask him why he flirts with you and if he says no then you probably have a good chance with him. Either way, if he has a girlfriend and he's flirting with you like this then you don't want him because he will probably be unfaithful. Good luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT- Why are you flirting with him if you have a boyfriend? Are you unhappy in your relationship?|`|U5dCFomCaa	well you guys are both in relationships right now. more flirting and people will talk about you two and that leads to trouble. so if you don't want people thinking you're easy or a h03, then stop flirting with him. you must like him if you are asking this question. if you do, stop going out with your boyfriend, it will just hurt him. since he is already with someone, it's best to back off. if they break up, maybe you guys can get together. what to do? it's simple really, just stop flirting. i wouldn't want my boyfriend to be with me and then flirt with this girl and rub her butt! how annoying...|`|nnZDsSBFaa	He's just messing around with you.<br>  I do that a lot as well :D<br>  It's not really a bad thing. It's fun.|`|Uyz7U8Uraa	no doubt he likes u or hes a perv No OfFeNcE to anyone

I didn't have my first real boyfriend till I was 16.  And I know I'm a hottie.  :D  Hope you feel better about yourself.|`|O4mdaz1Baa	Don't judge yourself by not having a boyfriend.  I have had one and it was horrible.  I don't want to date till later on (Mid high school).  Overall you are very adorable.  You are pretty to me and your body is fine.  Everyone has a little chub chub :)|`|VCoq0wYGaa	you are pretty and very young<br>  dont worry|`|bPaJXHw8aa	Hey ur realy very beautiful. Can u be my friend? I m male 17 mail me at akash_halwai@yahoo.com ok i m waiting.|`|PRjvY6Vgaa	I think you are really pretty. You have nice hair and very pretty eyes. Who cares if you're not skinny, you definitely are not fat, and are too young to be trying to lose a bunch of weight. Just start getting to know some guys, and be patient til you meet the right one.|`|hQHWVRyTaa	You are very pretty, and don't worry about being chubby, many guys like that!|`|BwBwSu9naa	i think your really shallow to just come on here and fish for compliments.<br>  <br>  Personally, you shouldn't care what other people think. Having a boyfriend isn't the world, ya know. Everyone is different and pretty in THEIR OWN WAY.<br>  <br>  This site is for people with actual problems, not just people who want to make themselves feel good for 2 minutes.|`|5oj5YfKMaa	Yes you are pretty. Love yourself, there is nothing unattractive about you. Be confident in yourself and don't listen to mean people. God loves you and so does your family and life really starts after high school so don't put so much pressure on yourself or think much about what mean people may say cause in the end the real world is better then high school.|`|HsrRNnIBaa	I think you have a fine body and a cute face. But your bangs don't look very attractive to me. They take away from your nice face. And they make your forehead look big. Let them grow out and wear a hairband to get them out of your face until they are long enough to brush to the side with the rest of your hair.|`|kHLWDgmIaa	I WOULD DATE U <br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  NICE PIC...
e5k8Bsxpaa	A best friend and a lover (just like what we look for)<br>  <br>  That implies:<br>  - Open communication- both need communication skills<br>  - Other variables that the particular guy would want in his best friend- depends on the person-- it's about whether or not you "click"<br>  <br>  And<br>  - Both about equally attractive|`|AE6Rap6vaa	Well...Im pretty sure someone who is willing to love them enough to completely take care of them and always be faithful! Kinda like a mother?|`|NaKW0E5Baa	Conversation.<br>  <br>  Trust me. If you can't talk to someone, it's useless. You don't want those awkward silences on the phone where you both struggle to find something to say:<br>  "...So... What are you thinking about?"<br>  <br>  Shared interests, but enough controversy to keep conversations fun.<br>  Someone they can just hang out with.<br>  <br>  They look for a friend, not just a date.<br>  <br>  Same as we look for in men, really.<br>  <br>  I mean, appearances help get their interest, but really, unless you have good conversation, its a relationship, not a partnership.|`|gpCjrJFcaa	Beauty and Faithfulness

I think the above are some good characteristics in order to lay a foundation of love and caring (Sorry that was kind of sappy [shrug])|`|tEy9hvebaa	DJ is pretty close... "The perfect wife is a lady in public and a **** in the bedroom"... add to that a few other random things (some guys like blondes, others brunettes, big chests or itty bitties, etc) but be his lady in public and his willing enthusiastic lover in private and he'll stay happy.|`|fjCxv2I4aa	well,if i was looking right now(im not)id have to make sure she had at the very least a modicum of intelligence.looks are nice too,but i could not date an idiot.|`|s5N28gsDaa	We just like short-term ones.

RvVvaVsAaa	well, in order to stop getting jealous of people you need to start being confortable with yourself. untill you do that, then youll always be jealous of SOMEONE. but heres some help in the meantime:<br>  <br>  1. you can stop frying your hair and putting heat on it or any chemicals. to have healthy hair you need to take GOOD care of it. as if it were silk. dont tug at it with a hairbrush when its wet. and you can also try taking a vitamin e supplement to help its vibrancy. <br>  <br>  2. go to the gym! (thats a no-brainer) walk, run, jog, lift weights.. if it really matters that much to you, youll do something about it! i recommend a treadmill for about 45 minutes 6 days of the week to loose some weight. hard at first, but youll be so happy with the results!<br>  <br>  3. you could wear colored contacts! directvision.com has a good selection, i wear the dark green ones and people always comment me on how amazing my eyes look! :) other than that, you could visit a makeup counter in the mall and ask for advice on a good eyeshadow color to bring out hazel eyes!<br>  <br>  sorry this is so long, i hope i helped!! and good luck girl! you dont need to be jealous of anyone, we are all beautiful!|`|mXhWvMveaa	i doubt ur chubby,  many girls just say that! loose weight well i have a fun and easy way, YOGA OR CARDIO WORK-OUT! and...make a list of everything that is good about you! and use garnier fructis or herbal essences or even head and sholders! I LUV HAZEL EYES! i have green/blue and i luv hazel eyes, guys do 2! so don't sweat it! STOP BEING JELOUS, THEY R PROBABLY JELOUS OF SOMEONE TOO!|`|rUjUmXNjaa	Just be yourself. You can always look better, but stop trying to copy people. So what if she has green eyes your eyes are unique, mine are just brown, so your a little fat? why would you want to be skinny curvy is much better<br>  As for your  hair here are some tips, buy some hair shiner I buy Smooth N Shine hair polisher, that keeps my hair nice and soft, then I Use a hair straightener, It takes me about 15 minutes to get it the way I want it, then just comb through and add on a little bit of that hair shiner, and don't Iron your hair too much because this will damage it.<br>  About your weight just eat healthy, don't torture yourself with exercises and diets unless your really serious about sticking with them, once you stop the diets you will gain that weight back and then some.<br>  How to make your eyes stand out? Makeup, Eyeshadow and Mascaras, I buy Avon and I get tips from my Avon rep about which shades look  good, she even has samples, and the makeup is cheap. Like I said there are always ways to look good, you just have to work with what you got, you never know? have you ever stopped to think that maybe that other girl might be jealous of you???|`|39LyjRE7aa	You could lose weight by simply staying away from fat foods and exercising. Eat a lot of vegetables, soup, and drink a lot of water. <br>  <br>  For your hair, easy, buy a straightener. Yes, maybe it DOES damage your hair, but really, no big deal. You can't really tell the difference or anything. <br>  <br>  And for your eyes, you could always get cool/pretty color eye contacts that are un-proscription.  (:<br>  <br>  Good luck !<br>  <br>  <br>  ~Namine|`|AA11199456	just think about the flaws she might have. remember that everything looks perfect from far away. she may be pretty but she probably has personality traits that make her unattractive. i know tons of people like that. i knew one girl who was gorgeous but her personality traits made her unappealing and dull. she wasn't too bright.<br>  <br>  do you have a flat iron? get a nice one and it should make your hair nice and straight. :) as for weight loss, just keep up good habits for a long time. don't expect to lose a lot in a short amount of time. wear a bit of black eyeliner on your top lid. :)|`|D2WIkmthaa	Girl everyone has their own style and their own beauty. Dont be jealous of her i mean think of how hot you can look after u fix yourself up a bit. Maybe you could go on the acai berry diet which is a great diet i ve taken myself and lost 20lbs off of. Any how you can get a free sample just pay shipping and handling. Hazel eyes are pretty! Is your hair dark? Well maybe u could wear some purplish dark eyeshadow and wear some blush and eyeliner.. Maybe straighten your hair.
BsjLu0hhaa	i say just go for the threesome
eIwF4Y62aa	1st, you should probably hurry before it is too late. Some things that might get his attention would be if u told him the things u like about him but not all at once. You could also start talking about the fun u 2 have and ur similarities. Just do whatever u feel is right for the moment.<br>  Good luck!|`|E6DEJGI1aa	Ok, as a guy let me admit this right now. These words will help any woman out there. SUBTLY DOES NOT WORK ON US. If you have something to say then just right out and say it. We miss everything that has nothing to do with whatever we are currently focusing on. If you don't come right out and tell this guy then you are going to lose him.|`|0ktcvglRaa	Either tell him how you feel, or forget about it and just be happy that he's found someone he likes.
D0IcWZfnaa	she probably thinks your cute or wants to get to know you.. alot of girls do it whenever they wanna get to know a guy lol.. she might have a small crush but start talking to her more maybe once she gets to know you more she will start liking you if she doesnt already|`|erf2yItaaa	im thinking maybe she likes to flirt alot but she likes you but you not the only guy she likes

Just tell her you don't want to have that kinda relationship with her. Don't say you think she is ugly because with will freak.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Stop taking her calls and leading her on. And next time do not give your number to a female you are not interested in. Why would you want to tell anyone they are ugly. That is so cruel and unnecessary.
TNNSHdypaa	I hate hate hate it when girls pile on makeup, because it covers up from their natural face.  Also, if I was to meet a girl and she was wearing make-up and looked stunning in make-up but below average when the make-up was taken off, that would be a huge turn-off.|`|3Y7RJu3taa	I'm not a guy, but many guys have told me that they don't like girls to wear a lot of makeup.  Too much visible makeup is a turn off because it makes the girl look unnatural.  Just wear the right amount to enhance your features without looking like you've painted your face.|`|RmQzb0Avaa	i dont know<br>  but i have on tons of makeup (black eye shadow, false lashes) and guys still like me (skaters, emos, ghetto ppl) <br>  i think all that matters is the personality and the looks maybe come 2nd|`|ZX8gOyfTaa	I don't like when it looks like a girl dipped there face in a make up kit it shows insecurity and hides their true beauty<br>  just some eyeliner and lip gloss for me x]|`|45UTKuamaa	simply as little as possible .

Usually eyeliner, lip gloss, and possibly eyeshadow. Too much more than that and it seems too insecure and hiding herself.|`|SrmR5iNxaa	Depends on the girl really. Some are just naturally beautiful.

Chances are he misses you, but it wouldn't be wise to hop back into a relationship with him. How many of your exes have you not missed anyway? You miss people. You just do.|`|dm1Iy6koaa	im not trying to be mean.<br>  but im so tired of seeing questions <br>  like this.<br>  "does my ex miss me?" "how do i get him back?"<br>  Listen.<br>  he is a EX for a reason.<br>  i know things get hard.<br>  i was in love for 2 years.<br>  but if i can get over it.<br>  anyone can.<br>  just forget about it.|`|6bSIAne3aa	Remember guys misses girls different than girls misses guys...  Most guys misses physically and most girls misses emotionally..|`|G3p7cglxaa	if it wasn't a violent break up then usually both miss each other.|`|D2WIkmthaa	Yeah it seems like he has feelings for you still and still likes you because no guy would sit and talk to a girl for hours at a time if they didnt like her.|`|ppWXraSHaa	wait until later just live life for right now and you may have a chance in the future|`|0tKNkAMuaa	its possible, or maybe he just wants to hang out, and be friends. Maybe its because he feels bad. He is your ex though, so don't act like he isn't because if you rush it then you might ruin it. One time when you guys are talking, ask him why he really broke up with you. If he is still dating don't mesh with going out with him, face it, its hard, but he is going out maybe if they break up. good luck, and i hope it works out for you two!|`|gcsnMAlCaa	No.  The harsh reality is, he doesn't miss you at all.  If he actually missed you, he would ask you out again.  As the first poster said, there's no point in asking about your ex.  He is the past, so move on with your life.

558BFdfTaa	It sounds like your b/f is getting to know your body quite, with a little more practise he'll have you in screaming O's in not time at all|`|AA11447210	Let it go on until it's not pleasurable, then change up and do something else...might be able to go back to that after a bit. If you can give yourself an "O", then he can learn to also...you just might have to guide him.

It's not terribly uncommon.

There are pleasant caring ones who aren't into the drama...If you find one of us, you should give us a try.

You know more about the situation than we do and you are guessing.  Is your guess right?  Who knows?  Are any of our guesses right?  Who knows?<br>  <br>  Who knows?  Hmmm?  YOUR CRUSH is the only one who knows for sure!!!  Ask HIM!!!  Always, always, always, no matter how hard it may be, cut out the guess work.  TALK to each other.  Good communication it the solidest basis for any relationship.  Again, cut out the guesswork.  Yo!  NO guessing!!!  Get to the facts.

lMbLirnfaa	wow this is a toughy.. I'm kind of going through a similar thing except due to my issues i havent had time to go see my best mate and shes taking it out on me...<br>  <br>  in your position theres a couple of choices... <br>  you can try and tough it out and painfully wait for her to message you but the downside is she might not text... but then again she might?<br>  another option is she seems like she misses you and is getting frustrated with you not being around...this shows the constant question of when your coming back... <br>  and i can tell how annoying it is... but then again with the bf thing..thats a difficult part.. and you being home schooled. Before you stopped talking to her did she come over and visit or anything? <br>  <br>  my advice would be to text her and tell her what yours and her freindship means to you..then explain the reasons of why your getting upset and that she has to understand about your circumstance... or you could just message her and do what you normally do until theres a break through or tough it out... if she really cares she will text you.. im a girl... and trust me we care about our friends but sometimes boys get in the way and so do our feelings when we miss someone close...|`|efTvaFFFaa	she might be feeling rejected, despite ur ear infection. Lonely maybe too. And friendship takes effort on both sides. If she doesnt want to make the effort to text you even, maybe you should rethink whether you want to keep this friendship going. Unfortunately theres not a lot you can do, good luck :)|`|FIMGjA4Waa	if  she doesnt understand that you have a inner ear problem then maybe she isnt a real friend. she should understand your problem and try to help you out.|`|gT1Ger8faa	Maybe your friend is just having a hard time and misses you a lot.She doesn't't hate you or anything like that.Some friends just don"t understand the pain that friends and others feel until they feel it too.She doesn't want to show that she really cares about you so she just fights it.Just give her some time to think things through and try again later.Maybe then she"ll be more opened to the conversation and remember don"t come on to the situation too hard because she"ll assume that you"re jumping to conclusions....|`|vvBb1ZPjaa	ask her out. shell prolly be ok then|`|3EM66IWFaa	If u don't need to talk with her what can we do?

He is married and so he's off limits. If you get involved with this man, he will hurt you. If he can cheat on his wife with you then eventually he will get tired of you too and he will cheat on you. How would you like it if you were married and someone was doing to your husband what you are doing to this woman's husband? I think there are enough guys out there without you having to pick on married men.

Ask her for some assistance.  Tell her your dilema... you feel like a lost puppy, ask her where room whatever is.  Thank her then begin to walk away... Then oh you fogot, "hi my name is Dofus.: Wait abit she will tell you her name.  Then say, "thanks again' as you hurry off...cause you're late... then spin around and yell... "Nice to meet you", and wave... <br>  The next day you can talk to her like a man.  Oh, thank her again for the help she gave the day before... it saved your life.|`|QLji3RCLaa	Whoa...that's like me. When I first got into college, I was always standing around by myself and my male classmate who I never knew before and later became my crush just randomly went "Hey, how was your weekend?"

It's difficult at first, and occasionally, because when you're in a relationship you want to take the relationship as far as it can go (when you really love a person).

87Yhfk5Faa	No, you are not dumb.  Taking advice from a 17 year old is probably not what you want, because I'm guessing your much older.  I dated a guy for a year and we broke up months ago, and it has been the hardest few months of my life.  We had excellent times, some bad times... but mostly amazing.  It was the best year of my life... and I'd do anything to get him back, I just don't know where to start.  I think that in love you should try and do anything to keep/get the person you want.  You should be able to over come all obstacles, and forgive all mistakes, even if it takes years to be okay again, it's worth it.  You should really talk to him...|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	I am naive!

062dcebc0cae227b915e6808bf0dcd18aa	Role play?<br>  You know, you could dress up as a nurse and so on, perhaps?|`|KhyPqoFIaa	Hello there<br>  I am the surfer <br>  <br>  Try talking dirty<br>  Use an outfit of sexy nurse<br>  Get to dress like kinky schoolgirl<br>  Dress like sexy nurse!?<br>  Use hand cuffs!<br>  Be the french maid<br>  Be the construction worker!<br>  <br>  From the surfer!
0ClA7HlEaa	Flirt with him. :) dance in front of him :P|`|CeyuSMT9aa	suck his ****|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  Buy some new clothes and change your hair color.<br>  If you say you are a dancer and have a good shape than nothing more will get him interested.|`|e28afc3a2533a60ee5465b6b8d794962aa	Really don't see what the problem is unless he simply has a lower sex drive then you. Communication is the best idea when working on a relationship issue, no need to hide how you feel.<br>  There is something you could do even if it is only once that may peak his desire; offer to swallow if you do give head. <br>  Seriously I'm not fond of it but men seem to like it!!|`|dBqV5ZjQaa	Lay on the couch completely naked with a can of whipped cream - when he walks in tell him that desert is served and spray the cream anywhere you want him to eat up!|`|kTvn2Nltaa	oh yea my girlfriend has a "dancers body" (Ballet) and i just love to see her body. i would just get anything that highlights that dancers body of yours|`|PbCeuT36aa	Do a lap dance for him.  God damn, he will probably bust a nut.  Trust me.  And after that start kissing him in the neck and breath in his ear.  You singled out all other options.  After all of this, give it up to him.|`|UOmH9vaPaa	I love when a woman takes charge and talks dirty in bed. Initiate everything and try something that maybe you wouldn't try before.|`|tV1D6pIIaa	Ask him if he wants to see a dance, if he says yes put on a hot outfit and then give him a big hug. start rubbin ur stuff on him then he will b hard|`|JUEVrk5gaa	some guys .. but not all get turned on when someone blows or sucks on there ears =D|`|J0PTYGAmaa	un button
khmKdTkpaa	thanks for answering my question!! i really liked your answer!! <br>  but with your guy, idk, guys are hard to read some times!! i mean if yall have hadd this flirty thing goin on, then i would guess!! bc i mean honestly, shy guys are not the type to mess with you, and not end up liking you!! girl, i think if you really like him, you will brake through his an your shyness!! i belive in you!!<br>  Hope I Helped!!!<br>  ~Ellie May~|`|Ddfff5psaa	Guys lose interest really fast, I don't know if he was interested to begin with now! Makes you wonder! Anyway, if I were you I would purposely go talk to him when you two are walking home!|`|w5Oedybqaa	Contrary to popular female belief, guys don't lose interest fast at all. Especially shy guys (like me and apparently him). Just talk to him I guess. It's really tough to talk to someone you like, but if you don't, nothing will happen.... OR you could have a more outgoing friend find an excuse to get you guys to talk. Whatever works.|`|wdYJqrnHaa	use the whole friend question thing it will let him know he is into u unless he's completely oblivious and will let you slide in to make the first move|`|JRJGUTNHaa	dont waste your time, he's prob playin wth you im a guy i would know
khmKdTkpaa	i personally think YOU should ask him!! he will then know that you are interested, and willing to talk to him!! this mite make him open up to you, but im not for sure!!<br>  Good Luck!!<br>  Hope I Helped!!<br>  ~Ellie May~

qzRDh8Rgaa	You a guy? Hmmm, it is fine to hate porn, but then you like it ... but regret watching it after you are not horny, dude do whatever you want, everyone is different, most girls hate watching porn and many guys love it but that doesn't mean everyone hates or loves, you are fine, the rap thing, there are a lot of people who hate rap because they think it demeans women, nothing new trust me. And ya you stand up for women when a guy says something, but that guy just is horny you know? He isn't saying I wanna rape her, he is saying he wishes he can do her... but ya just don't do anything crazy unless he says it about your sister.. chill
HOVvKqxsaa	i prefer her to be serious but not sad<br>  i wouldnt want to hurt anyone's feelings and i'd try to keep her as a friend

That you're not interested anymore, that your cat just died, that you just crashed your car into the garage.<br>  <br>  As long as it's the truth, then you should tell them.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to tell them the truth, then oh well. <br>  <br>  Best excuse I've heard: I've gotten REAL sick, and I don't want to contaminate you.|`|hxQaqSvkaa	The truth or tell a lie that is believable.

If you never want to see him again, you don't have to. But, who knows? You might actually have a good time.
LxfqUaaIaa	Friends with benefits means he doesn't plan on having any emotional attachment to you (ie: a relationship) but he's open to being physically close. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't go there.|`|0mcvCOfyaa	Yes ask him out, and ABSTINENCE IT THE ANSWER! You are a bit clueless aren't you? So i think that he is a bit of a perv btw!|`|0sI33S9Kaa	he likes you|`|s8pSHKpIaa	He deffinitly likes you, he just kinda sounds like a perv....|`|VLvwmPGCaa	im guessing he likes you
168Be95faa	something similar happened to me and it took a while until it stopped hurting. I told myself that he wasn't worth it and and as time passed i started to like him less and less.|`|83pyUYI4aa	the same thing happened to me=[[. i was so heartbroken i didn't think i could get over him. i pick the song cry by Rhianna but it's not a love song more like a heartbroken song. hope you feel better and everything turns out better=]
yuwjQjKqaa	Yes he still likes you.
BbT3DCHvaa	Just be confident, relax, and smile.  As long as you are relaxed girls should gravitate toward you.  Just have a good time and good luck!|`|XasLRQnXaa	you're looking in the wrong places for a girlfriend. Clubs are mostly for one time things to be honest, i would try somewhere else.
vfv7YqhPaa	Hi,<br>  It's me. I have had a crush on you for a year now.  Not just a little puppy love crush, but a heart-wrenching, agonizing, consuming, can't-get-my-head-straight crush on you.  I thought I made it clear how I felt about you.  We talked a lot, had a few laughs.  I'm done waiting.  I can't cry anymore.  So I just have one thing to ask you.  What is your excuse?  Are you gay?  Do you have a girlfriend?  If you were too scared, I'm not that intimidating.  If I had known a year in advanced that you would not approach me, I probably would have given up long ago.  <br>  <br>  Then again, I guess it is partly my fault.  I should have at least tried to ask you out.  I guess I was too afraid to approach you.  I...don't know what to say except...I can't take it anymore<br>  <br>  -me<br>  <br>  <br>  How was that?|`|ox77vqviaa	EVER WONDER WHY ICECUBES ARE SO BORING?!?

I rele like this guy and i know he likes me too n ive waited forever for him to ask me out n im getting mad..!!! So you shouldve def asked her out!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|LaE7ksIaaa	Oh, my gosh!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You waited a year!!!<br>  You're stupidd!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hahhh.|`|TyQciyGKaa	uh no i would just talk to you and be like "dude, it's been a year, why haven't you made a move?"

2f0137f09289e62bcaf3e3903473e994aa	Well I would say that the abusive relationship is the reason that you've been feeling so down in the dumps. If Your not unattractive and before the abusive relationship happened, were a a generally happy person? I suppose deep down inside those feelings that happened to you have finally caught up. <br>      Try to see a Counselor. perhaps a school Counselor, or talk to an older sister, mom or close family member that you feel close to. I can tell that your feeling suicidal when you say you wish you could disappear' and that is NEVER the answer. you need to find an emotional outlet for all of these feeling that have stopped up you true spirit. I was once like you. Trust me. I know what your feeling.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|eQENZXz1aa	Well you just gotta convince yourself really is not any other way.<br>  <br>  and don't dog yourself for sleeping around if you were a guy you would be a hero ...so don't feel guilty for that|`|HUvcQvQYaa	It's because you are a woman and naturally like to be abused and have low self esteem. Most likely due to your hormones.|`|AdL8Y4X1aa	beauty starts from the inside sweetness, you have to think about your personality and why that makes you such a beautiful person, think about the things you do in general and for other people and how you handle situations those are the things that make u a beautiful person..<br>  <br>  as far as the outside, even if u were the ugliest girl on the earth, YOU shoulld never think about yourself in that light, you should embrace all your beauty and flaws, and learn to love them this way you understand and respect yourself<br>  <br>  if in your past relationship your boyfriend was verbally abusive that probably has alot to do with it, but when people are abusive verbally or physically in a relationship its because their probable unhappy with themselves <br>  <br>  as far as your body, its all you have, don't give it to just anyone because when u meet the perfect guy it wont be as sacred anymore, i think you should start respecting yourself<br>  <br>  also you have to start loving and respecting yourself before anyone else will ever began to do it<br>  <br>  good luck|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Yes, things that happened in our past can destroy our self esteem. Just try spending some time with yourself and find yourself and get yourself back together,to find your self's worth.Good luck|`|pMDY89KQaa	sleep with mr rogers he will make the sad go away for you.
N8oaGQPBaa	come on girlllll <br>  embrace your beautifulness<br>  i bet a thousand girls would KILL to have your face hair and body<br>  just forget about the past, move on, those were old days and those days are over.<br>  flaunt it girll!! <br>  hah : )
A8kFnvw1aa	I would be really mad if I didn't like him, but I might only think that way now because I've never kissed anyone. You should get another worker  to ask her if she likes you, or to somehow find out. If she does, that would be a really really cute and sweet thing to do. I would love that so much if the guy I liked did that to me. But if it's someone I didn't like...|`|Kl4kv5khaa	I am unsure.|`|VN3R0I5Oaa	i think its good movement but like dont do it unless u think shes 100%%% OKAY with it|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	don t do that ,, you better tell her first tha t you like her if she likes you that s the time to ask for a kiss don t steal a kiss , she will get mad at you|`|RlCxB1J8aa	Dude I think that is sweet and an awesome idea. You should make sure it is ok with her though. Tell me how it goes. Good luck.|`|3oBgOlqJaa	IT  depends:<br>  If she likes you- it would be an extremely cute move...go for it<br>  If she doesn't like you that way- it would be really wierd, but I'm sure u guys could just be friends and joke about it later|`|o4fykobbaa	try to compare yourself to that of the other she has dated in the past, and if you see some similiar qualities than i would make the move, but if you are nothing like them, i would think that it wouldn't be the best move on your part, but who reallly knows, right? What do you have to lose?|`|rFCJ0eW3aa	aww thats cute. (:<br>  but if i were you i'd make sure she liked you too.|`|CT64FYrvaa	that would be pretty sudden, if this girl has no idea wat-so-ever, don't do it! she will just get freaked out
awUzUxo5aa	He wants you....<br>  <br>  But he sounds a little odd....<br>  <br>  Turn your phone off and get a cuppa coco inside you....|`|q4kEXT9maa	He's a show off.....i guess he's interested but beware....he sounds borderline weirdo.|`|p9A61dFgaa	Hes probably texting when hes relaxed enough not to worry about it.|`|xDom6mr3aa	hes in love :op<br>  <br>  gets drunk and thinks of you!!!<br>  <br>  kinda sweet... :o)  He'll reget it tomorrow :o)

But actually it's her that gives him safety and comfort when all else around him is going bad, or he's in-between girls at the moment. He gets the feeling she's the one who's the love of his life, when in fact she's just too soft to realize she's being used and made a fool of.|`|l6rSKl46aa	yes and i have fallen in love with you. seriously stop doubting yourself so much as i read an replied to your other questions|`|Fb3PMgD2aa	Circus

A5W8LQzVaa	Most probably he really just want to be your brother. If he don't consider you as a sister then, he won't mind your feelings. Also, probably he's taking  much time to check on you if you can have more than a brother/sister relationship.|`|3EZfZ8gwaa	That was exactly like me and Josh, we were like that for months... I looked out for him and never let him out of my sight, everyone knew us as being brothers and best friends. In time however, rolls reversed or became equal and he looked out for me constantly...<br>  Then we became equal and we were thicker then thieves...<br>  I would say if he doesn't call you his brother, he still cares about you like one...<br>  <br>  If you read my questions however, you will know that Josh is more then my friend... I'm gay, and turns out he was to... one day he actually kissed me and that started alot of trouble...<br>  <br>  Now I wait for the thumbs down...|`|3EM66IWFaa	consider him as your brother
BbT3DCHvaa	You need to sit down and talk to him.  Communicate your feelings about what he was doing and how you were feeling.  If you really want him back, don't give up.  Good luck!|`|eQENZXz1aa	well there is only like 100million other fish and your not old so you got time to find one better even|`|chZFmJOPaa	You CANT get in touch with him? Hmmm... well leave a message and/or an email explaining you're very confused right now. If he really wants to be with you, then he will contact you back. <br>  Yeah it might be nerve wrecking to wait it out but it'll be worth it... if you guys cant talk about this more, then how is a marriage going to work, right?<br>  <br>  So just email/call him. Leave a message, tell him you care about him but you need to actually have a long talk with him, in person. Tell him how you feel. Let him know you want to make it work, but you both need to talk about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|LpedVLedaa	Gotta keep moving on, as that is the only way you'll know for sure...is from the outside of the situation looking in.<br>  <br>  based on the drugs, I'd say you did the right thing.
AA11899313	Continue talking.<br>  <br>  Sash.|`|WFFXHFfVaa	Its hard to really say from just what uve said, how old is this woman? maybe she is just being friendly towards you.
ppDu6qUbaa	Asking if he would date you if you were ugly or overweight is not the same thing as asking if he is only dating you for your looks.  While dating based solely on looks is shallow, looks are legitimate selection criteria.  No man wants to date an ugly girl.<br>  <br>  Most men actually prefer how women look naturally without make-up.  Putting a lot of effort into your appearance instead of being genuine is going to attract men that only care about the social status of having a pretty girlfriend, as you have demonstrated.  Try toning down your level of make-up stuff and see if he treats you differently.|`|Me14R9gKaa	What the hell is a peacock? Like the bird? <br>  <br>  Ok, if you really feel like he's using you as a trophy girlfriend, test him.<br>  <br>  Take a couple days, and scrub yourself down.  Don't put a whole lot of effort into your appearance. Go see him... in public... in sweats, tennys, no make up, and your hair up in a pony tail. If he negatively comments on it... then you'll know if you're just his trophy girlfriend. <br>  If he doesn't even mention it... or look at you any differently, then your relationship is the real deal.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|WIXH1OFVaa	Trust your gut instinct! If you're beginning to feel like maybe he is just parading you around and is shallow, you're probably right about him.<br>  Sometimes it's hard to find someone who likes you for you, but there are good men out there - you just need to search.<br>  But I think the best advice I can give you is follow your intuition.|`|JP8nyXEBaa	What does he do that makes you feel like you are a "trophy" girlfriend? <br>  <br>  Ask him what he likes about you, if you havent already... Or you could always put it to the test, intentionally make yourself look bad for a date and see what he does.<br>  <br>  Just trust your judgment .|`|uLyBjMonaa	harsh truth is most guys judge everything based on appearance and honestly if you really cant decipher whether he likes you based on your looks or personality then you should move onto someone else<br>  <br>  PLEASE ANSWER!!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ante5XjV1pqAY79Js1z9If_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306190011AA6rXkQ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|NgeZASTYaa	If you don't wanna be a Trophy gf, don't date a Peacock bf.|`|4TD4xg5Xaa	Can I use you?|`|mKZXFe22aa	well, i don't necessarly think he is treating you as a trophy gf lol, i mean would he date you if you were fat, probably not lol. i mean he might not be attracted to big girls -- would you still date him if he were ugly or overweight? <br>  <br>  well, i would say end it then! you are obv a pretty girl, and if you have a nice personality you dont have to settle for a guy you dont REALLY like, right? <br>  <br>  hope that helps :) <br>  <br>  xo<br>  <br>  ps.

If he spends more time looking at his reflection than he does looking at you, then you are less than an accessory. Try going on a date with him looking a little less than fab. If during this time he gets bummed out because you are looking a little less than your usual fab self. You might be an accessory.|`|0oyiXko0aa	when he delibretly takes u infront of his freinds and really is all over u in front of his freinds, especially other dudes, thats when u know<br>  <br>  <br>  when that happens<br>  <br>  dump him|`|PVYJYVaAaa	try playing 20 queatsions and if he doesnt ask any personal questions then..<br>  or trry and find out if he knows anything about uother than ur looks|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Well if you wear make up and have your hair always done. <br>  Don't have your hair done and your make up mostly off in front of him and wear not as nice clothes..and see if he still likes you than. Also another sign is, if he is just using you he will be all nice to you around his friends, but when you guys are alone he will be just a big dick.|`|qpmGLd7laa	Being attractive and female makes it difficult to find a descent guy, probably because you're so distracted by the attractive *** holes that constantly flirt with you.  (Being attractive and male makes you an *** hole?  Fact.)  You don't seem stupid or vain, but you do seem nice.  That says to me that you're easily flattered, and will think of your dumb *** boyfriend's initial kindness as actual kindness, when it was really just to get into your pants.  To answer your questions, no he would not still date you if you were ugly or overweight, and yes he is probably using you to boost his ego.<br>  <br>  Really, all relationships involve a boost in ego (i.e., ego support; also important are stimulation and utility).  But I think your problem is that he doesn't quite use you for a respectable form of ego support, such as sharing ideas, but to draw attention to or add to his own physical appearance.<br>  <br>  How do I know all this about your specific boyfriend?  I don't, of course, but psychology is a science, isn't it?  Don't people pay for counseling because they expect psychologists to predict and correct their behaviors?  Why yes they do, and that implies that we all agree that people are predictable...<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Stop dating douches.|`|nOAlXAJ5aa	You can't really use the "would he date me if i was ugly or overweight, it is mostly that he would not, and you are not so it doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  but as for making sure he really likes you, ask yourself, does he do nice things for you, does he call you to see how you are, or does he only care about himself.<br>  <br>  You could always just spend the night in and see if he wants to join you.|`|CVWizvy6aa	Investigate what your vibe is telling you. You say he worries too much about his image, then there is a possibility that he is using you. <br>  <br>  How would i know if he would still date you if you were ugly or overweight??<br>  <br>  Maybe you should spend more time getting to know him.|`|498JdszFaa	I think you should trust your gut feeling on this one.

I2aRDvQyaa	Well me i would wait a little bit longer to see what will happen. And maybe he wants to wait a little longer because he might be trying to get over his break up. Maybe his heart was broken and he needs some time to think things through , He might think that he is going to get his heart broken again. So he might even want to wait to see if you really love him or not. Because he might fall in love with you and then you might break up with him and he don't want that to happen to him so those are my opinions why he might be wanting to wait.|`|PkDL8vemaa	give him a little more time cause he probably wants to wait till you like live closer to him so you can come over anytime but dont wait forever meet some other guys after like two months or less|`|5cb325d6a30d690ba203659662ae054caa	I think the more important question is whether or not you two are exclusive or seeing other people.

7AVMS7Mpaa	He's an immature idiot. Block his number. Change your routine to avoid him. Try to avoid common friends. If these don't work, hook up with someone else in front of him.

UpHGcyZyaa	well for a tounge kiss, hopefully if you go with the flow it should go naturally.<br>  just do what you said and if your not sure wait for him to make the first move with his tounge and then its like a sorta little game, whichever side his tounge is on you put yours on the opposite side and when he moves his move yours, but this is all very slight, if your moving your tounge around too much it can get gross.<br>  for starters just run your tounge along his lower lip while your kissing.<br>  when i madeout for the first time it really was all just a blur, he just sorta slipped his tounge in my mouth and then it kinda just came naturally what to do, and you just kinda follow his lead.<br>  dont worry, all it is is kinda wigglin' your tounges around together, haha<br>  it sounds funny<br>   =)|`|QWeh9Xmoaa	i felt the exact same way before i did, but it just happens. theres no certain way how to do it, you just know how, i guess. but dont worry, i was nervous too. haha my first time was funny bc the first time i was about to make out with him, his dad called. omg it was sooo funny i started laughing so hard bc i was like of course that would happen to me!! haha but then we ended up making out like the next day or something, and i was soooo nervous but dont worry about it, its like natural instinct to make out or something haha no one can tell you how to do it, it just happens. good luck :]|`|9DLsBJJQaa	just stick ur tongue in there and swim or wrestle<br>  just fuk around inside lol<br>  <br>  dont make it harder then it is.|`|Do310qvTaa	gosh no! don't listen to roovz.. .that's terrible! swim? wrestle? ugh.<br>  <br>  This is your first.proper.sexy kiss. Its pretty big, and can make or break the way you feel bout tongue.<br>  <br>  Now in all seriousness, don't stick it in his mouth... just stick it a tiny bit outside of yours resting on your lips so he can feel it when his lips are there, he will take the initiative and touch his to yours to, this is the BEST and can get yah pretty hot (but not to much...because your only 15 ok)<br>  <br>  Its the best way to do it as a start... and when you're reeeaaallly into each other (if that happens) then the tongue does venture further (:<br>  <br>  Good luck and dont think about it... just sorta...feel it!!
AA11050777	Why do you think he is a Jerk? Maybe he is just a bit shy, and now that your friend told him you liked him, it makes him awkward around you because he likes you too. And by the way, blushing is one of the most obvious signs of attraction, so I would act on it if I were you before you both regret not making a move when you are 38 and remembering your highschool days at your reunion.

FZKFLTyLaa	Clearly, yes he does!!
Av8aVFAaaa	Since you seem to be close he may be comfortable with flirting with you even though he wants nothing out of it. But my guess is that he has a little kindergarten crush on you, and if you like him back you should act on it, but not come straight out that you like him. Flirt back then see where it goes.

PLuSpKRIaa	Just give him a chance. Your boyfriend needs to have friends as well as a girlfriend! If he starts hanging out with him more and you get no time alone with him that is when you  need to start to worry. But for  now just let him hang out and have fun. Make the time he has with you worth it!!!!|`|HOdUzES4aa	I understand you want to be the one he turns to and to be his best friend but it is good for your boyfriend to be friends with his bff. Sometimes guys just need to be with guys plus if your guy spends more time away he will realize how much he appreciates the time he is with you. I wouldn't be concerned and would just be happy that that have reconciled.|`|aCMkyR3saa	no matter how much they hang out hes not going to "steal" him from you  men need space ive been with my guy for 5 years and im his wife and best friend BUT he still has his guy best friend men are weird!!!! lol|`|ZOgZumRGaa	Bros before hoes!|`|71ULvUQwaa	Bros before Hoes, Its not right for you to take his best friend of nine years away especially since they have been together a lot longer then the two of you, and probably will always be friends while your relationship may or may not last. If you try and he has any since he will break up with you.|`|0ktcvglRaa	Doesn't your boyfriend have enough time in his schedule to be with you and with his old best friend? It's unhealthy for couples to spend TOO much time together.|`|AA10250756	He's not going to lose his best friend. Smile and be nice to the guy. Find Nick a friend of yours to date so it's double dating instead of the three of you.

RO5fRyIvaa	I like mimi answer the best, but I would do a little bit more than just that. FIRST! you must see how he interacts with others. Maybe set up a situation and have one of your friends talk to him and find out how he carries a conversation. It's quite obvious he's awkward and NOTHING is worse than trying to talk to an awkward person. After you find out more about him, talk to him at a good time. Not the first time you see him, but you'll know the moment. Maybe he is extremely shy, but he sounds a little scary to me. But just try those things and see how it goes. Do you kinda like him, too?|`|WKAqqYXEaa	I think he's just shy maybe he hasn't had the guts to approach you.<br>  If he's good looking or if you think you two would hit it off then approach him.<br>  <br>  If you don't like him and you want this to stop ask one of your guy friends to have a word with him.|`|PVYJYVaAaa	STALKER sorry but thats real wierd|`|J7diy2goaa	ok it's very weird, he probably stalks you and has a shrine and now wants to kill you|`|W9GTkt3Jaa	he's not just shy, he's HARDCORE shy.<br>  lmfao.<br>  maybe he does like you.<br>  ;]|`|PytpVZx0aa	Maybe<br>  He's a stalker.<br>  How old is he?|`|gKhR0sgLaa	Extremely shy|`|5lm9D2zdaa	weird.<br>  try to like talk to him first, and if he still acts like some crazy stalker he probably is.|`|7hZLgQOMaa	He's obviously got sever shyness lol looks like if you're interested in him at all you will have to go up and say something.

4d7f164df9b799e88fffba204ae0183faa	I agree with you.  Some people are sooo stupid or desperate or something.  They just wanna get married ASAP to anyone who will have them and don't even bother to find out if they're a good match.|`|xoDfbfBNaa	I think there are many people who never consider all of the "details" involved in a life together when they decide to get married. They're too caught up in the being in love thing, and figure the future will sort itself out.|`|nOrWOZU4aa	The statements that you wrote, to me, are not strong enough, for me anyways, about wanting or not wanting children.  Neither one is a YES or a NO.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	People think they think they can convince their partner to have kids or their partner will be okay without kids.  Some women think once they have the baby the guy will come around and love being a dad.|`|OHfZFR31aa	I know too many people who think they can change their partner's mind. A friend's husband of 8 years just left her when he found out she was pregnant because he didn't want kids. Another male friend's wife has always said since they started dating that she did not want kids, and he married her anyway. Now he's regretting marrying her because he wants children and she still doesn't - and never will.<br>  <br>  If children are that important to you, then you should only marry someone who feels exactly the same way. If they are not sure, then don't take a chance unless you want to end up a single parent someday.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	It sounds great in theory, but in reality that doesn't happen too often.  Truth is, each partner is always hoping the other will change their mind about it down the track, and when it doesn't happen, problems arise
wuZXqYPGaa	well i do think she still wants ya she just may be acting a little itty bitty playin hard to get, just a bit tho. and theres only one way to find out if shes worth all the hastle, is to go to the dance with her, whut could be the worse that could happen? good luck bud

(to mention). Besides 3 kids don′t let much time for learning a new hobby,,it′s too much.<br>   Women need more time to communicate our feelings, to feel in love and to bring desire back. Women are by far more emotional than men, we need time together to feel we still are in love and we still are loved..We need the "feeling",,,Husbands are more into rational behavior, they need to work and provide what′s needed, that′s how they say I love you..If you understand that you could start understanding your wife′s behavior. She′s living with a stranger.|`|QS6hSdZNaa	Get a marriage counselor talk to her.....she is not in love with you that is very obvious....you also need to understand that it should be 'love' and not 'obligation' .....may be you are demanding certain behavior thinking that it is an obligation that she should obey....you are also not in love with her.....So both of you need counseling|`|2nGa3N38aa	she is taking you for granted knowing you are a good man|`|OojlfDlBaa	Honestly, it sounds to me like you are way over worked and so is your wife. If she is not working it is her responsiblity to keep house and watch the kids while you are at work. At the end of the day it is the husband's duty to give her a break. I feel that your wife may be depressed with her life, which will cause her sex drive to decrease. Sometimes us moms don't really express that this is not how we really want to spend our lives. I suggest having a calm one-on-one talk with your wife. If this doesn't resolve the issue I would seek counseling. Also, never push sex. This will cause a woman to withdraw from a man. Try sparking the romance again and maybe taking a weekend for yourselves. Hope this helps!|`|SckWdjnVaa	Probably with your hectic schedule & responsibilities, you have forgotten to appreciate your wife for the small things that she does that binds the family together (the routine work) !!!<br>  <br>  Try wooing her as if she is your GF & see if that stirs her a bit? Take her on a date, give a surprise gift, do anything that might have once made her feel special...n chek her reaction.<br>  <br>   If that doesn't help, you need to have a serious talk with her before jumping to any further conclusions!|`|pTlnCNYJaa	12 hours a day aye, well maybe she's a bored housewife and you guys need to ditch the kids for a weekend and spice up your sex life.  Do something different and explore other  exciting ways of having sex, buy some naughty  stuff from the sex shops and take her somewhere cool.|`|NlulTfFOaa	Sounds like you're married. That's how it goes. Have fun.|`|aCMkyR3saa	maybe shes insecure or cheating|`|EB9lR5AUaa	Maybe she's having an affair. Or maybe she knows about your overuse of CAPSLOCK!|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	You are obligated to communicate frankly, candidly, and openly about your expectations, likes, and dislikes.  She should do the same.  It took quite an amount of "routine" to get in this shape.  Let her know that you are not satisfied with the way things are going.  You may find that she isn't also.  It is never too late to change it.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Your love life is dying, be careful, the next thing is an affair then a big ugly scene of jealousy and pain. Then the threat of divorce and the loss of everything you've worked for including your wife.<br>  <br>      You can stop it all by initiating the sounds of a consular, both of you before it's to late. Maybe they can bring out the problems your having.

U5dCFomCaa	OKAY, just add him on facebook!<br>  i added this guy i liked on myspace [i had him before], and i was already sweating and nervous before i clicked the add button. i clicked it, then waited FOREVER to click the "do you really want to add this person?" button. but you know what? i just clicked the buttons and scram. 5 seconds later, i got an approval. so i ran all the way to my room and squealed and called my friend. SO GO FOR IT GIRL.<br>  <br>  just give it time. you guys will eventually talk, trust me. if it's anything like me and this one guy, i'm sure you guys will start getting to know each other more. baby steps first.. then you decide what to go from there or ask another question on yahoo answers! (: hope everything works out(=|`|u1JnaA5Jaa	you should become his friend and see what happens. i relly relly like my friend Steven, and i tink he likes me back. his eyes twinkle when he stares at me and he starts to blush when i talk to him. become his friend and see if he does things like that. and F.Y.I boys always datte younger girls cuz they're more mature then them. i learned that from my teachers n my friends (cept Steven...YAY!) sooo... ya. btw, luv ur avatar
PkDL8vemaa	they probably do that cause they like love sex and stuff and ask your mom if she could cover up when friends are over and not to make out in front of them cause its kinda embarassing|`|K8uYKj06aa	just tell her it's embarrassing|`|RgbARcJTaa	"mum dad Stop IT YOUr F^ckin Embarrasing ME <br>  PLease Stop Go To Your Room!"
ajKJcoBFaa	Just Be Confedent and go up to him and tell him that you wanna talk to him and just walkaround with him and tell him that youre starting to have feelings..<br>  dont be shy or anything cuase then guys will think that youre unconfidant but anyways good luck and just go up to him and tell him.|`|vKctajqiaa	wow i have the same problem|`|f49NiNrdaa	body language....make eye contact,simply tried to flirt but don't overdo it!|`|a1iam8Zvaa	i think a note<br>  you dont want to go through the awkwardness of talking to them in person and saying it<br>  unless your really close with them<br>  but most of the time a crush is with some one you dont know so well lol<br>  so i think you should either have a friend tell them that you like them or just write a note and pass it down to them<br>  =]|`|PJZRGsc3aa	that's stupid<br>  <br>  don't beat around the bush, get to the point. Make our life easier
IPirciPFaa	best advice is to play hard to get if you want him guys want what they cant have if you don't call him or anything he will call you and when he does call you act like your busy or something.trust me it works|`|q3XXDlhwaa	It sounds like you love him and hate him all at the same time. It's probably a normal feeling that you get when you break up with someone, but it could also mean that you didn't never wanted him to break up with you too. If I were you i would move on, go to the club and have fun at met new guys. He's stupid to break up with you in the first place. The only thing you can do that will make him jealous is that you play the game he's is playing. Just have fun at the club and flirt with some guys, you might find someone you like better than him.|`|D2WIkmthaa	Keep doing what your doing because he probably thinks he can get you back whenever he wants. Act like you dont care and leave him alone for awhile and he will come back beggin for u to take him back and hopefully wanting to change his ways. If he loves you he will realize what he lost GOOD LUCK|`|yFSv9sfgaa	Girl, you don't have time to play games. If he's not for real then don't waste your time. Point blank.|`|angW1Lkfaa	Why do females fall for jerk?|`|UDGBrOqaaa	He is flirting cos he does not have any stable relationships.<br>  Make him happy. Let him feel a real lady close to him.<br>  Let him feel that you are the only one and he does not need anyone else. Make children and call me in the end of the day I will be a God father,!!!!  LOL
llepn8nyaa	yes it is<br>  love isn't a matter of time but feeling<br>  not of speech but of a spiritual connection two people have|`|00FghzGfaa	it is possible, you never got over him from when you guys went out. and from the sound of it, hes not over you. you could go on and never find the answer, but you said he was going to college, right? well its now or never, just trust yourself, be confident, put it all on the line. get him alone, with no distractions and tell him how you feel. he'll either go with it, tell you he feels the same and you guys will hit it off fine and have a nice good strong relationship, or he will tell you that he is over you... but either way now you know. if its for the worse, then its not too bad cause hes leaving and you dont talk to him that much any ways, but i say you go for it girl!
ETV7yvNbaa	Well, you just need to watch what you say to guys. Mostly, you should just try to talk to your girls. Make sure you talk to the guys as friends. Flirting with other people when you are in a relationship leads to bad things.|`|mXZ4825aaa	I think girls who are flirtatious are gifted. I wish I could be a flirt is so hard for me to flirt with a guy. But sometimes you have to control your flirtatious side when you with or around your boyfriend because he will get mad. Just try to prevent guys when you with your boyfriend.|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	dont be, stay as you are, it shows you are still alive , nothing wrong with that at all.
kIM2Brx9aa	Trusted someone that didn't deserve my trust in the first place, and not following my heart.|`|BCgp7GTpaa	unprotected sex.|`|aYVJTSCWaa	Not left home to attend a university because of a boyfriend.

Kj02Sqseaa	Well it depends on the guy.  For instance, If the girl I liked asked me if I liked them, I would say yes.  However since I doubt this girl likes me, that will most likely never happen.<br>  <br>  But as I was saying. Some guys will and these tend to be the ones who are normally outgoing but are shy among girls, or people like me who you might just have a vibe that they will tell you.  But this is tricky business to determine, and if they say no, then you may make it very awkward between you two.<br>  <br>  However here is what I recommend in order to get a guy to admit he likes you:<br>  1.  First try to make sure your not really around anyone else<br>  2.  Be having a convo at first that is light, and isn't really awkward.  Slowly, and somehow progress into talking about people who are dating or who someone else likes.<br>  3.  This step is optional, but I would highly recommend it. If you want to make it easier for the guy to admit if he likes you then you have to first tell him you like him.<br>  4.  Then ask if he likes you.  So for steps 3 and 4 combined, this is what it might sound like "Listen... this is hard for me to say, and if you don't think the same way then lets just continue with our lives as though it was insignificant.  I have strong feelings for you, and I have been dying to know if you like me back."<br>  5.  If he says no, don't make a scene, just say you understand and your sorry if you made it awkward.  If he says yes, then continue with whatever you think is right.  Maybe you could even ask him out or ask him if he wants to go do something.<br>  6.  Act the way you normally do around him, whether he likes you or not!  This will prevent as much awkwardness as possible.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope I helped, and I hope the results turn out well!|`|POfAilFfaa	if their important enough to you, just get them alone and ask. but don't be a jerk about it or be rude just ask him how he feels about most guys will tell the truth but only if your willing to be open with them to.|`|2vS7qaZLaa	try making he close friends to tell you, if you know he likes you and want him to confess then you can either give this knuckle head very obvious hints you're interested or make his friends encourage him.|`|ZBWVBdAGaa	only if he is open|`|jwRcAOtfaa	i dont think its possible|`|8SRjELNBaa	yeah it's possible. During my freshmen year in college, i was talking to 3 girls & the one that was starting to go downhill, i told her "i like you" just to see what she'd say.... lol. Turns out she's crazy.<br>  <br>  However, we'll most likely show you other means that we would like you.

Walk up to her and start an everyday conversation (hey, what classes do you have today, etc). Be kind to her, dont try to be cool and act as a jerk...mention how nice she looks(girls love compliments). earn her trust...do small favours like carry her bag, compliment her....and after all that...i would say in about a week (dont rush things)...ask her if she wants to do something sometimes...like do homeworks together, go to movies. REMEMBER: girls like guys they can trust and who are honest(no lies). Do all this and you will have a great relationship with her. Good luck buddy.|`|JPY2Papiaa	walk up 2 to the ***** n say hi

jE0Y9su5aa	No difference at all. When I was in junior high I dated a girl with braces and we made out all the time and trust me I enjoyed it : ) The thing is that when your making out only the lips and tongue should be touching and the teeth should not be affected.  So as long as you know ho to kiss it should be fine.<br>  <br>  Also the good thing about braces is that in the future you will have very straight teet, so alll of the guys will be enjoying that!|`|APctQdilaa	sometimes braces make a girl shine|`|yULnOJUwaa	Been there done that - female's point of view<br>  Years ago when I wore braces I kept my lips together so I wouldn't scratch him up but it did kind of tear up the inside of my mouth.

What a stinker. Boys are like that, if you have a boy you're close enough to wear his sweater, act cold around him and make sure the stinker sees you wearing it. Irony is awesome, I tell you. And if you can make it one of his friends, it'll be even better.
b733f6d70469e1993c15a54c325797f9aa	it shouldn't be that hard, it's not like you're proposing to her...<br>  <br>  keep it simple, ask about her weekend, find a common ground... then see if she'd like to hang out sometime|`|rULYGvz9aa	Same way you would ask out anyone else.|`|ml2FDYECaa	Relax...don't rush into anything.

Either write a letter or buy her lunch during lunch time and then ask her for her digits|`|RwujkZeLaa	not hard
UpHGcyZyaa	yes!<br>  <br>  trust me i am a girl and i know girls, and we do silly things like that because we think it will somehow make a guy notice us and like us, hah<br>  she probably has a crush on you but is too shy to talk to you.|`|JfsN4FSraa	defiantly into you!|`|T6VDbr5Faa	That's kind of weird... I think she wants you to hear what she's saying or she wants you to notice her. Maybe you should give her attention!|`|kf56x8K8aa	tell her you have a big dick she will want to ride that thing all night. GIGGITY!!!!!!!!!|`|FFh9NyT5aa	she might like you... from experience... she wants you to notice her... do you like her? cause if so, you could definitely make a move!|`|Y5032C2laa	yeah she likes you now you need to do something about it r u ready?|`|E7TkNO00aa	Yeah, sounds like she likes you.|`|D3zmTOKQaa	sounds like it. try talking to her and seeing if she is interested.|`|sLkMlt8kaa	Doubt it.|`|uqwL9544aa	No|`|qaWtwRGpaa	she is soooooo into you! :)
AA10776535	You can have a commitment ceremony and not get a license, but you cant get divorced if your not married in the first place.  Get a lawyer to draw up some papers and do you thing.  But there you go more law stuff, you cant get away from it.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	It's not illegal to get married without a license, but the marriage will not be legal, valid or binding. If you wish, you and your intended can stand under a tree, look at each other and declare yourselves married. You're not breaking the law to get married without a license, but you're not legally recognized as married without one.<br>  <br>  A license isn't permission, it's informing the state/country in which you live that you're married, in case of one or the other of you trying to defame, steal from or do harm to, so that YOU have legal rights.<br>  <br>  The argument about the origins of marriage licenses is moot, seeing as how times have changed and mixed racial marriage is a non issue now.  <br>  <br>  Your "power of attorney" is called a Pre-nuptual Agreement, which is widely used for the purposes you describe here, and also completely useless without a marriage license to make the marriage a lawful one recognized in the US.<br>  <br>   State shenanigans? You call what the state does shenanigans ?? Why don't you go look in a mirror and ask yourself where you got your ideas about government, and then look again and see if juuust maybe you're not taking this to an extreme that's unnecessary, tedious and conterproductive. I think you're barking up the wrong tree.<br>  <br>  Just so you know - the religious ceremony means nothing to all but you and your partner. The only thing that matters to the state is the license. Without that, you are not legally married.<br>  <br>  You have a warped idea of what government is for. You keep saying that you don't want government to intrude in your life, but where do you live? If you hate government that much, just GTFO and move to a place where there is none. See how well you do there.<br>  <br>  Best of luck !|`|NB4h4jTyaa	You will have to check what the statutes are in each state. Draw it up in NY and if you move, make sure it's fireproof in Missouri. Also, make sure that all of your next of kin are on board with it as well. <br>  <br>  That's my reason for wanting legal civil marriage available to everyone, regardless of gender. Too many times family decides what's right FOR you instead of you and your partner deciding what's right for yourselves.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Eh, it's not actually a benefit to married for tax benefits if both work unless they're earning very low wages.  I don't mind the marriage license I use to carry it with me all the time when I'd use my husband's debit/credit cards because I never changed my last name and sometimes they ask for ID.  Neither my husband or I have worked at a job that allow domestic partners or whatever to get on the insurance.<br>  <br>  I had a civil ceremony and I personally like how it's done.  It was cheap and we have a nice certificate.  You don't permission to enter a relationship.  Just documentation if you want to be legally married (although this isn't necessary in some common law marriage states)  The original intent of the laws weren't to prevent mixed raced marriages it's just some states decided to use it for that.  My state I don't think ever had any laws prohibiting interracial marriage.|`|c07v7O80aa	You get to decide you don't want to play by the legislature's rules. Fine. But they get to decide that you don't inherit his IRA without paying the penalty, they get to decide that you don't get the pension when he croaks, and they get to decide that you have to terminate the partnership in a civil suit, rather than a family court action. And no one happened to ask you to approve the law. <br>  <br>  Oh, and you're imagining things to suit your own desire when you imagine marriage didn't require lawful sanctions before the 20th century. Do what you want to do, but don't whine that the mean ole racist government did something for some social reason you think validates your position. What's glaringly obvious is that nowhere in all this did you say WE WANT.
ZCLdV2HBaa	i bet he is wondering the same thing about you... you can't expect a guy to show that he likes you if your just acting like a friend to him. if i were you i would invite him somewhere.. like im in college so id be like hey i know some friends who are having a party do you wanna come with me? and than that night take it to the next level ya know.. touch his arm when your talking to him and stuff. and hug him when he gets there bla bla. make it aware that you like him.. <br>  <br>  hope that helps? just dont want it to end up in one of those situations where someday he does have a girlfriend and ya'll get in the conversation of why didnt we ever date and he's like i liked you i just thought you never liked me.|`|v7fsd02Naa	ok, so he's leavin it up to you because he doesnt want to seem pushy, and if you still dont want luch or dinner, then just say something like,"im not feeling for the food idea write know, but maybe we could go bowling" or something like that. hope this helps|`|diZcujn2aa	maybe he likes the phrase; a mans heart is through his stomach.. maybe just trying to keep the relationship in the friend department.|`|g1sLFY7Raa	this guy maybe acting like he doesn't know that u like u him. so he is giving you the chance to make a move.|`|KMabQOhqaa	Well it's upto you isn't it?<br>  Either you go out for something to eat with him or you don't.<br>  I'm not sure if he's asking you out on a date or if it's like a friendly dinner/lunch thing, you'll only know if you do meet him.<br>  If your really not in the mood then suggest something else to do.<br>  Or just go " yeah i'm up for some food, where do you wanna go? " and see what happens.<br>  x|`|WFFXHFfVaa	Well sounds like he likes you, if u dont want to go for a meal, suggest to him something that u want to do instead, just say I dont feel like going for a meal this time, but feel like doing (whatever u wanna do) instead. Sure he wants to hang out with u, so dosent matter what u will be doing|`|Ddfff5psaa	He put you in control, so obviously he likes you but is a real loser.  He didn't take control like most guys would.  It's kind of a good thing.  He respects that you don't want to eat out, so yea just let him know what you want to do.
ETJgEzZZaa	He finds you delicious idk haha|`|9gkgSFJhaa	it means he want to EAT YOU! :)
AA10757358	My heart goes out to you and your siblings.  I know you don't want to be separated from them but none of you can continue to live in the situation your in now.  Do you have relatives you can talk to and maybe live with them.  If not then talk with your school councilor.<br>   Do not lie for you mom.  You children deserve a good home with someone that will take good care of you.|`|zZdF5qUIaa	I think you should tell the whole truth to DCF dear. You need and deserve a better environment.|`|M9wX28Q1aa	oh my goodness, you are in over your head.  i'm sorry to say this, but i think you should let the social worker know the truth about everything.  i hope it all works out.|`|wUWvO5r6aa	Your mom needs to deal with her self and get some help, You need to get out of there with your sister and brother and hope for the best. My mom was a drug addict and alcoholic it was hard to see her like that all I did was pray for her every night and now she is all better after many years of getting help.Please let someone who could take care of you do it.And always keep in mind that you want to be a better person that her and don't let her addiction stop you from achieving your goals pick the right road. Don't use your mother's excuse to hit the wrong  road.
p0pDGL6zaa	Well.<br>  When you love someone, saying those three words arnt enough.<br>  Like, just being with the person and the feeling he/she gets..is when you know your in love. knowing that the other person has your back and feels the same way , is comforting. which is why, us humans say "iloveyou" to our bfs/gfs:] Its also, when the bf or gf..looks past the outter beauty and gets to know the person..if you know what i mean.<br>  saying "iloveyou" to someone, is no joke. i mean, when you find that person..youll know how it feels. i guess you havnt met that girl yet!<br>  <br>  well, goodluck and i hope you do.<br>  ciao!|`|tM35loy4aa	I believe for me its like love of first sight. You feel so happy and never get bored of it.|`|qSRsqWqpaa	Well, it's really quite simple.  <br>  This link explains it in detail.<br>  <a href="http://www.truveo.com/Anchorman-Afternoon-Delight/id/1966816574" rel="nofollow">http://www.truveo.com/Anchorman-Afternoo...</a>|`|D3zmTOKQaa	i wish i knew. i'm pretty sure love is mythically.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	tina turner has the answer!|`|79FON9cCaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsCXZczTQXo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsCXZczTQ...</a>|`|2uxaGUNqaa	Love is unexplainable, the feeling could never be explained. You just know in your heart when you find that special someone. It may sound cheesy to you, but it's true. Just, go slow and don't try to go out with every girl and try to possibly find love. Let love find you, and when it does, you won't have to ask any questions, you'll know (:|`|x61pDxeiaa	It is like magic.
9UQlhzitaa	each time you love it is different.<br>  <br>  the shaking and getting teary just proves you have had your first love my dear.Your missing him is genuine not just a crush<br>  <br>  the expecting to see him with the others filled you with so much joy it took your breath away literally,you fell hard for this guy is all<br>  <br>  if you 2 don't get back together then the feelings will fade in time and someone else will get you to fall in love with them|`|X4i2jej5aa	This happened to me with my old crush, except that he didnt move, I just love to see him and can't bear to part with him. If you are wondering if this is love, then you really get into the subject. Many ppl have feelings like this, and they want to feel the feeling of being in love so bad, they think they are, but chances are, they're not. <br>  Have you ever talked to him? How much? Does he seem interested in you? There is a chance that this could be just another huge major crush, or this can be love. But if you guys are not close friends, and you think you are in love, then you should think again. If he loves you back, thats great, and if he doesn't, you can always find someone else, this I can assure you. <br>  This question, you need to ask yourself, for it is only you who can answer this question. I'm sure you'll know. For love and him just being a crush is two very different things that I know you will know. Maybe not now, but you will know.|`|UTQjqk4Baa	you might be experiencing a bit of puppy love|`|ppWXraSHaa	what rayann said|`|FHrQzaPqaa	did this person die? that's the only thing that would make anybody<br>  freaked out.

Just try to flirt with him a little and try to be close with him, simple as that. I hope this helps, have fun have a good night.|`|On09PfPYaa	I have not but to answer you question how do I act, be yourself. Even if you are a little shy or can get that way I would personally tell him I am little nervous, if he asks you why I would tell him. He would appreciate your honesty and being up front. Then you being shy and not saying anything he could take it as it is him, if you are up front then he will know it is nothing personal you are nervous.
OZZlaR1caa	if it bothers you thats up to you... some people might be fine with that.. but if youre not happy, youre not happy. and chances are he will probably never change.|`|AA12229316	yes you are justified. 1 and 3 are especially annoying and weird. I think i have a similar situation in that I feel like sometimes my bf convinces me that i overreact even though in the first place i totally feel that he is wrong about something. Does he not have any money to go out? If he does then he needs to take you to at least coffee or something. If things are like this now, how will they be in 5 years? Not a good path.
S2xWbrgpaa	Ha Ha as a fellow gamer chick, horseback rider and a "no sex before marriage" girl, I totally feel your pain. It definitely seems like you have a strong head on you shoulders and the right ideas. On the other hand It sucks because you feel like you like him, even just as a friend, but your afraid of the man slut reputation. Plus everyone keeps telling you what you should think and how they think of him blah blah blah. I have been in similar situations a few times before. First, do not listen to others besides very close friends who know you, yourself and how you feel about him and his actions. Second, I noticed the comments that you mentioned that Gerry said. I may be wrong, but knowing guys, he seems to have his mind on the "one thing" rather than getting to know you. This is popular for guys no matter what age you are. Although he may say sweet and nice things to you, pay close attention to the sexual references- these may tip you off that he could be using you or he only sees you as a challenge to get in your pants. AKA hes a jerk that doesnt deserve your time. Unfortunately, you will find that some guys act a bit shy, cute and chivalrous to get what they want- just keep this in mind.  On the other hand, he may just be nervous around you and saying dumb sexual jokes for a laugh out of you- this is what my current boyfriend does, its really annoying lol. But it is your call to decide what type of guy he really is since you know him better than me obviously lol. Either way you have every right to feel weird and uncomfortable when he acts that way. If I was in your shoes though, Id probably be very curious to find out more about him and see what could happen between us. I encourage you to do this. But if he blurts out one of his obnoxious sexual comments, say something that kind of knocks him down a few notches like: "Id buy you a lollipop if I could find the stick" then laugh.  This tells him that your willing to joke around, but he needs to chill out a bit with you cause you are "not that kind of girl." In addition, its great that you told him how you feel, you are truly awesome! Its also great that he seems to understand, he may be a good guy. BUT If he tries to push sex or related actions on you definitely get AWAY from him. There is a lot to be said about a girl who ACTUALLY has the guts to reject a player type guy! Hopefully it turns out that he really is a nice guy. But if you find that he really is a total jerk, do not be afraid to stand up for yourself and make it known that you are a lady and you demand respect! Again, I get the feeling that you are a strong woman who knows what shes doing. On the bright side, keep in mind that there is always a huge shortage on gamer type chicks etc out there. I assure you that there are tons of guys out there who have respect for girls, and who are willing to love you for your Zelda loving self and who would rather wait until marriage than lose you. Good luck!!|`|2vS7qaZLaa	I'm the same here, "no sex before marriage", You can never trust guys like these, I have a friend like this and all he does is flirt with every girl in sight. I highly doubt and guy around this age would truly change because of a simple crush on you, I mean you even said he been out with couple of girls. I suggest you shouldn't go out with him, he sounds like he just want the "bed". You can still be his msn buddy but don't get to serious with this guy. I also have a girl friend (friend that's a girl) like this and she really hard to find out if she views you differently then others. Even if you think he is seriously considering to have a relationship with you, you won't like it, you know why? He is a guy whom would get people whom likes him jealous due to his habits of flirting a lot.|`|63JKaFVGaa	(this is purely on the information u gave mah)<br>  <br>  date him, figure out something to work with. u can email me if u want to report me on it.(anafreakydude@yahoo.com) then, after u get to know him, go with him to the fair. dont go ahead. just stick to games. <br>  <br>  then, have a "talk"<br>  say you wont have sex yet.<br>  <br>  u really have to tell him to fall back, but if u REAALLY like him, u could get with him. But, i think he just wants to put his ____ in ur ___|`|IkjSbxO1aa	Sorry  most juys just want that and he first asked you about the casual sex to see how you reacted if you reacted wrong he would say its a joke if not the GIT ER DONE you know Talk to him as a regular dude he doesnt like you theres more fish in the see<br>  unless its radioactive and 50% of guys like first person shooter games<br>  Whats out there uhh<br>  Halo 3,Halo Three odst<br>  Counter strike<br>  Gears of war that sort of stuff.<br>   (\__/) (\_(\<br>  (='.'=) (=' :')<br>  (")_(") (, (')( ')<br>  For your troubles<br>  No such thing as an ugly girl|`|d9mhyVmSaa	What really matters is whether you like him or not and whether you think you would be happy with him or not. If you don't like him, just ignore him and I believe he would understand. If you like him and you are always happy around him, don't give up the chance [:|`|o3d3NBVzaa	He's interested in one thing, and one thing alone.<br>  <br>  If  you value yourself, then save yourself the trouble of expecting a good relationship with him.<br>  <br>  You may want to flake out for the fair...like tell him you have another girlfriend from another school or something like that you really want to take. He might take the hint, but I doubt it. He will probably be pretty persistent.<br>  <br>  So, if you like him, and want a relationship with him, he will want sex. If he doesn't get it,  then you will break up, no doubt.<br>  <br>  Or you can tell him about your values, and IF he cares more than sex, then he'll be cool with it and respect you. You can then try to start a relationship. At your own risk though.|`|XasLRQnXaa	he's only trying to get in your pants i don't know why you keep leading him on if you don't want sex...

Leave skid marks. He is showing signs of passive aggressive behavior. You dont want that. He is not going to change. He will keep being a jerk and then apologize afterwards. Everytime he does that, he chips a piece of your self-esteem and heart. It is abuse but not the physical kind which can be just as painful. You are better than that. There are other guys who will treat you so much better!|`|Me14R9gKaa	Yeah... you should break up with him. <br>  <br>  It may seem like he's being honest, but from the outside looking in, it doesn't seem like it.<br>  <br>  He kind of likes your best friend... what the crap is that? <br>  <br>  If he keeps hurting you, you really should break up with him.

Good luck.|`|5iOHJHUzaa	- He breaks your heart<br>  - He calls your friends b!tche$<br>  - He tells you other girls are hot<br>  - He tells you he likes your BEST friend<br>  - He likes some chick at his church<br>  <br>  And you have to ask us if you think you should break up with him?<br>  <br>  Anytime someone is hurting you in any way, it's not a relationship you want to be in.|`|NgeZASTYaa	He can ONLY hurt you if you LET him.<br>  <br>  WHY would you wanna be around someone who doesn't treat you with respect? Don't you know that you deserve respect ??<br>  <br>  Dump him and find someone to treat you right - you DO deserve it.<br>  <br>  pls take care|`|KIqxPxTJaa	Sounds like he's not faithful... I'd break up, even if you really love him. If he really liked you, he wouldn't be looking at other girls the way you described. I think you should end it...|`|Y5IZdvQNaa	God, i can't believe ur still with him!<br>  <br>  I wud've been dumped him<br>  <br>  i dont think he deserves u
zzaScg0haa	If you aren't into him leading him on isn't fair, if you are into him then there is nothing wrong with staying with him
t2R3mEMoaa	It's just your imagination, we all have one. You are quite normal if you are in your youth. It's just wishful thinking.|`|W36vy2iCaa	not normal u weirdo|`|daSyJZyeaa	Honestly, I'd say so. Happens to me MANY times a day.
AA11909552	More data would have been helpful, but I would suggest to compliment him. Agree with a lot of what he says and just be a happy soul that isn't too demanding.
sBm95Us4aa	First, think if you said something that might hurt her feelings. If no, then maybe she's playing hard to get. Or... it could be she was REALLY busy with something and couldn't contact you. Just wait a day and see if she replies back. I think she's probably busy.|`|zIGTzoxjaa	get over yourself<br>  she COULD be busy<br>  or maybe she doesnt have her phone with her at the moment
1qkdHe8jaa	haha! dont think ur gonna get 50+!!!!!!! lol! well, have u heard the phrase "trust ur instincts?" well, its true! trust ur instincts! it works! and if u hug her, then ull find out if she likes you by the way she hugs back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! gl!|`|0oyiXko0aa	keep trying don't give up. but dude eventually u will have to move on if she keeps saying no. she might really start to dislike u and like think ur a stocker or something. there are plenty of fish in the sea man.|`|Qbczt3ivaa	It sounds like this girl did have a previous crush on you, but when you gave her the cold shoulder, It showed that you had no interest. I hate to tell you this, but  from what it looks like, she has probably moved on. Maybe she has, and maybe she hasent. Being a girl, I'm trying to figure this situation out..which is pretty complicated... I think she was willing to give you a chance, but after your expressions, she has probably changed her mind. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you say you have crushes on you right now, why not give them a try? This girl doesnt sound like the girl who would be open in a relationship because her emotions and reactions are hard to tell....You'll get over her one day trust me.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  Sara|`|cflktD34aa	didnt read all that. just foreget the girl well the first one anyway
707gOCvbaa	He likes you but is either very shy or taking his time to get to know you. Tell him you hate going to the movies alone and more likely he will invite himself. So it's a date but not really a date. Find out what he likes to do on the weekend.Ian seems like a real keeper. I wish you luck in winning his heart.
0ClA7HlEaa	Because She's an adult responsible person and are willing to be able to help students. She just wants the students to be succeed in life. <br>  Thats why shes doing her best to help. You know people can mature when they're older anytime. They learn from their mistakes. <br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helped! :)|`|YR9l82vmaa	what? you're asking "why is someone nice?" well, gee i don't know. perhaps you should ask her. maybe she's simply a nice person. that very well may be, you know.|`|DRQMnXpKaa	No its cause she has a thing for younger (way younger) guys....lol

In my opinion-hell yeah!|`|imKCvvFKaa	OF COURSE I'D HUG HIM BACK!!! lol awww that's cute! good luck with this girl!!!|`|IXCAJdBiaa	lol of course if know FOR SURE she likes you'll make her day for sure id say got for it!|`|ab1f7d57468e90d9853d1bcd3fa04263aa	well idk about other girls, but that would make me really happy knowing that the guy that i like actually noticed me because i am too shy to go to them myself :( and i would probably hug them back!|`|urQnRQ4jaa	I would most definitely accept the hug especially if I liked the guy and he asked for a hug...good plan man!!! I hope everything works out with her...|`|0917sYkqaa	Depends on the girl.<br>    I hugg every persond i talk to except for my crush cuz he is just a jerk :p|`|rULYGvz9aa	I would hug him.|`|rk88caKaaa	I think you should talk to the girl first. Otherwise, you'll probably intimidate her. Hugs are great and all, but it's a little creepy and potentially stalker-ish to just randomly hug people you've never really talked to before.

I sat behind him (not directly behind him) and was so happy I had something interesting to do in science (look at him).  I'm sure I'd talked to him at different times, but one day he came up to me and genuinely complemented my outfit and how I looked.  I just said thank you, but was so excited inside because he said that I looked nice that day. <br>  <br>  LoL.  Ten years later, I still remember this.  I was enthralled he noticed me.  However, I was a bit quiet and awkward.  If he had offered a hug, no matter that I thought the world of him, my response would have been, "Huh?  What are you TALKING about?"  Weird, huh?  I guess it depends on the girl and how she feels about herself.|`|sf0xtpeeaa	I'm a guy, but my ex-girlfriend told me when i first asked to hug her, that she was beyond happy!

cMzA8qTMaa	How would your bf feel about it?  If you think your bf would be upset then you did the wrong thing.  If he wouldnt be upset then there is no prob.|`|g1qoAtaRaa	There's no problem with that; it's not like you're marrying the guy.<br>  <br>  If your bf has a problem with it, then so be it, the dance is in the past and your only hope would be is to apologize.<br>  <br>  But the easiest thing to do is to tell him exactly what you said up there^ that the guy was upset.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Dani|`|lkSDiQ8Naa	Cheating on someone is a bit different to dancing with someone... I guess that is something you learn as you grow up.<br>  <br>  Be honest. Tell your boyfriend you wish he was there. Make a joke out of it? <br>  <br>  Something like "I was miserable that you weren't there! Then (the boy) asked me to dance. It was so funny! We started dancing and talking about how much I wish I was dancing with you and a slow song came on! It was hilarious!"
qzRDh8Rgaa	You are not an idiot for asking.<br>  So what is wrong?<br>  Here is the best thing you can do, girls tend to like positive guys. Meaning brush whatever is bothering you off your shoulders if you want to have something with this girl whether it is a relationship, sex or simple friendship. You really don't wanna show that you are down, or depressed, be like sorry I was busy and be like what's up, what are you doing. If she likes you already, she will like you more if...<br>  <br>  You smell good, are clean, look confident and happy, positive...|`|ABvnT9xKaa	You should just tell her and get it out of your chest. You need to take risks. I had to make 2 risks in my past, and i was nervous as HELL!!! I'm not the person to get convinced to ask someone out or tell someone i like them, i'll go, "Nope, i'm not going to." It's Very hard to convince me to do something. But i took those risks cause i needed some experience, and it's helped a LOT! So, take that risk!|`|Hc16k31qaa	Girls like it when guys open up to them, but if it's too personal, I suggest you share it later on when your relationship develops. If you're comfortable with her, she might even give you help with your problem.|`|RmQzb0Avaa	talk to her about it and tell her that ur not trying to be pathetic..im sure she'll understand<br>  and shes trying to connect to you and she cares for you thats why shes asking you..duuuuuhh<br>  <br>  my point is...JUST TELL HER!|`|CTJZhkdiaa	Tell her.
JikGoEGZaa	sheesh...what a coward. break up on text!!?? She can have his tired butt! You can get a better guy than that. If she dates him she will find out what a wuss he is.|`|WFFXHFfVaa	Real friends wouldnt even consider going out with an ex, esp since u still love th e guy. Just tell her you wouldnt feel comfortable if them 2 were together as u still have feelings for him, if she dosent respect that, then she not worth having as a friend.|`|g6ENt03Oaa	At least she asked. My ex best friend just went ahead and dated him anyway. Needless to say it ruined our friendship and I didn't have feelings for him anymore. I know you don't want to hear this but if she's really your best friend she wouldn't put you in this situation and no I wouldn't tell her yes if you still love him. I'd tell her you still love him and you'd be hurt if they went out.<br>  <br>  Edit: If she didn't even tell you then she isn't even worth being your friend. I know it hurts so much that she could do this too you but believe me if you don't get rid of her she'll walk all over you and treat you like dirt. I let a friend of mine do that for 18 years and finally got sick of being treated like dirt and told her I had enough and I don't speak to her anymore. If she was a true friend she would tell you to your face of things like this. But at the end of the day it's the 'girl code' you don't date your friend's ex's especially not your best friend. I'm so sorry I hope it works out for you!|`|XH1YP57Oaa	i think u should tell your friend 2 do what she wants. <br>  just because u wont be happy, let her be.. u have to. :] <br>  your her frind &nd if she thinks u dont want her 2 be happy. things could get ugly. <br>  although she is breaking the girl code ;] lol <br>  since he so harshly broke up with u..  <br>  good luck.|`|dn5BmFVhaa	haha yeah well ima kinda on the other end of that question... well my bestfirend like means the world to me but like she waz going out with this guy named tyler and she didnt even like him. she was just going out with him jus cuz he asked her.. well then i didnt really like tyler.. well like she was always hugging other guys and flirting with other guys and tyler started gettin mad at her and i would have to like sit there and try to convince her to stop but she didnt care which i thought waz like really rude! well like me and tyler were talking and like he jus got so done with her like 3 weeks ago and he broke up with her jus cuz something i said which was she wouldnt be going out with tyler if this other guy didnt have bad grades cuz her parents would get like really mad! well i thought that she was beinga total ***** for doing that and tyler was like one of my bestfriends and i thought he deserved to know<br>  well that night he broke up with her we talked on the phone from 630 pm to 530 am none stop.. i was letting him vent and we were just having a good ol time lol... well then he tells me that the last 3 weeks that him and my bst friend were going out he didnt even really like her.. and that hes been liking me like ALOT and he likes me more than he ever did with his x.<br>  well ever since then every night me and him talk on the phone for at least 2 hours at min. and we even have a song lol.. well i really like him like ALOT but like im not allowed to date even though i have been secretely.. but ive been cought and im like still introuble lol.. well were even saying i love you like everyother minuet....<br>  i like really want to go out with him but like it would be to akward going out with my bestfriends ex boyfrind and like she knows that he likes me but not how much and she thinks i dont like him but most people think and pretty much know that i do...<br>  idk but like he would be the best bf ever hes sweet he buys you things talks on the phone so long that he even falls asleep cuz he didnt wana hang up on you lol... he did it again lasnight :) and hes fuuny and his friends like me to :) always good....<br>  but like i know your problem to cuz thats happend to me! but i know how your other friend feels and its not a good position to be in.. but i think that you shud tell her cuz that means everything for what in this case what you would say to her....
ZjM0ghSnaa	I definetly think you have a chance with her. Why not? She probably is interested in you if she sat next to you. Yet, there might've been no other seats. <br>  Anyways, it certainly is a bad idea to let someone know that you like them before you actually know them. Every girl reacts in a different way, so she might be a little freaked out, and will think that you like her mainly on her looks. Get to know her better, and talk to her first. You sit next to her, so that should be no problem. You could go for it and tell her if you want to, but dont rush things.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|jjvP7Kkzaa	i think you should ask her out somewhere as friends and see if you like each other.

Clearly he admitted he doesn't want anything so I think he is just using you.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	talk to him about it when you both are ready for a relationship...<br>  <br>  can you please answer my question ?<br>  <br>  go to my profile under my questions the first one that says <br>  <br>  "HElP!!!!advice....."<br>  <br>  i would gladly appreciate it<br>  <br>  thanx :)

OlK0Pa1Gaa	It really depends on what guy. Some guys like it and some guys don't. Looks definitely matter no matter who says it but whether or not if some like it or not is a different story. I don't think that you should be self conscious over it though. It's your body don't feel bad about it. And If it really does bother you that much then I'm sure you can fix that tiny flaw in no time :)|`|XhexwM1faa	I'd rather see a big breasted woman with a "curvy tummy," as you put it, then a flat chested girl with sizzling abs. Think about it: a girl with no breasts and hot abs? Those are the traits of a man! Not a woman! Be proud that you actually have decent sized breasts and look like a real woman. I think a bikini is meant to flaunt your boobs, legs, and hips, not you stomach. Its a huge turnon when a thick, curvy, big breasted woman is wearing a bikini. But when a flat chested girl wears a bikini, i just laugh to myself and think "what the hell is she flaunting?"<br>  <br>  So yeah, your poochy stomach means nothing. wear that bikini proudly! Besides, I like a poochy stomach and love handles much more then a toned stomach where I can feel her bones when i'm, touching her|`|RDgyb7W8aa	How many gals do you know that have a perfect body?  Not many I am sure, some have more than there,  Ask your friends if they are comfortable with their body.  It is the who package that counts, personality, a little bit more here, a little less there.  Don't be self conscious guy like you for everything.  Not too many have a toned stomach.|`|cyRKzRqFaa	Depends on the personality of the girl really. I know several fat girls that have a high self-esteem and are always kind and fun loving.|`|0EUBc2hRaa	absolutely not. a little meat isn't bad. too much is not good.

There are guys, definitely, who will find you attractive because:<br>  <br>  a) they find you physically attractive<br>  or<br>  b) they conenct to your personality better, so looks dont mean as much to them<br>  <br>  If you feel bad about your looks, you need to improve your self esteem.  Being self-conscious and having bad self esteem is more likely to be a turn-off than your stomach.|`|vfgzBRsraa	It actually depends on the guy to tell you the truth.  Some guys don't seem to mind but then there are the others who make you feel like you have to have a perfect body, even when there are things wrong with them.<br>  <br>  If your lil tummy bothers you then you can do something about it, but if you're cool with it, then he should be too.|`|ci7Q54Gwaa	Honestly It depends on the guys. Sometimes like twigs, some guys like Huge girls, and Some guys like inbetween. If you're a little round then that really should't be a problem cause alot of guys arent exactly toned so they cant say nothing. But then again, it really depends on the guy. :-)|`|ad5gMHlgaa	ohk.My rule is.<br>  If you way more then me we dont date.<br>  A flabby tummy is not gross TO AN EXTENT.<br>  Just get out there and run a little.<br>  Tone it up and stop worrying about how you look.|`|qJVazXKvaa	It really depends on the person. But a lot of guys like their girls to be curvy and meaty rather than the anorexic models modern day TV promotes.|`|EVc90HV0aa	A girl with a little meat on her is the SEXIEST thing on earth. I'm not saying fat, just a little meat.|`|4g2EAbtMaa	Personally, I like curvy women. Go ahead and bare it, girl.|`|AA10112105	It depends on what we're dealing with here.  I mean, girls shouldn't be bigger than me (200 lbs), but lots of girls are just paranoid and don't have anything to worry about.|`|0ysJ0KHWaa	no one likes an incredibly skinny girl, i like a girl with a little bit of meat on her (kinda chubby) sme men like fat chick some like skinny women. u have to find someone who likes ur body|`|DuC5hfdfaa	If you have a pudge/roll/MASS OF FAT on your stomach, that's not gonna help you anytime soon.

Search BBW and see how many sites are dedicated to the Big Beautiful Women out there. I prefer a more cuddly woman myself.|`|DET61tGPaa	Not really, if your stomach isn't fat than it's not a big deal, and usually if your boobs stick out farther than your stomach thats a good thing, i would say by your description that you shouldn't have any problem, and sometimes it's cute when you meet a girl with a bit of a curvy tummy(depending how curvy, but a bit is good)<br>  <br>  Everyone says that size doesn't matter, but you have to be physically attracted to someone to like them, doesn't mean it should be as abig a deal as everyone makes it though|`|hQHWVRyTaa	Nope, I actually prefer women with some curve to them.|`|GqTSa85daa	It wouldn't bother me.|`|eQENZXz1aa	some guys like it

As long as you just touch the outside of your thing, then yes you are still a virgin for sure. But if you enter anything inside your vagina (a dildo or something lol) and break your hymen, then you are no longer a virgin. But generally masturbation keeps you virgin.|`|AA11103763	Masturbating is not the same as sex. You lose your virginity when there is actual penetration and your hymen is broken.|`|AA11353473	Yes, you are still a virgin.<br>  You have to have ___ with a guy to not be a virgin anymore.<br>  <br>  Answer mine please?:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aq.YAP4TDTdtrBR4BSoAy_zsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304152842AAjiLa3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Og9abf2baa	yes, you're a virgin...Have FUN!|`|0OyYUI0iaa	yeah you're still a virgin
W9dabUw7aa	It sounds like you are basing how you feel about yourself of your perception of how others think of you. There's the problem, right...you try to just feel good about yourself and some people will find you attractive and some people will not. Each day, just do the best you can with your self and say....yup...this is me...and that's great....could be better, could be worse...looks are only one part of me anyway...and I only really need for one special person to find me attractive...and in the meantime...take care of yourself and be a decent person in all the ways you can so you will attract other decent people. Good Luck and Take Care!|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	It means different people have different tastes.  Welcome to the real world.|`|0k9IJYS1aa	we have our good day as our bad|`|b70cNqyqaa	Here is what I think it means:<br>  <br>  Those who say you are ugly, are ugly inside, avoid them totally from now on. <br>  <br>  <br>  Those who think you are sexy, ummmm, is that a compliment or a mere observation? <br>  <br>  Sexy doesn't always mean something worthwhile. People can be sexy and be very bad too. <br>  <br>  So what it means is, you have to decide what kind of people you enjoy surrounding yourself with, the meanies, or the sweeties.<br>  <br>  Im rooting for ya...|`|EqI76IRVaa	well chances are you just a very specific type. like some think you are really attractive, but some dont, because they go for different types of ppl. like your probably rare, and so like theres only a certain group of people that find you super attractive|`|NfA7nDQkaa	it's a matter of opinion for other people and for you, well, everyone has those days. go watch a really funny animated film like horton hears a who in your pj's and eat some popcorn.  you'll feel better instantly! i guarantee|`|AA10025781	different people have different tastes. and nobody can feel sexy or beautiful all the time, everyone has moments where they feel ugly.|`|YLkD4lgPaa	In this world Everyone is different and they have there know point of view.<br>  or maybe its because someone wants u to be happy and someone is jealous from u.<br>  but<br>  remember that everyone is nice and good from inside, the outside doesn't matter that much|`|rgCWPPLmaa	I have the same problem. I get offers from modelling scouts every few months or so, and I swear to god that sometimes I look like a weird old man, or some kind of donkey-creature. I'll never figure it out.
d7ZAmllcaa	what do you mean 'not an original story' im insulted.  my dad IS wealthy, he was the owner of 5 companies, and i DID fall mentally ill at 18, im 21 now and you know what life hasn't got any better, consider yourself lucky you have not yet met hell.  if it wasnt for my fathers dedication i would have been in jail or dead
zC3SLBKJaa	If you feel you have stood up for yourself and your feelings and she doesn't want to compromise with you, there is only one thing you can do.  Leave the situation, leave her to herself, and go your own way.  Don't yell, don't wait.  This is like ripping off a bandaid on a hairy arm, you gotta just do it, and do it quickly to suffer from the least amount of pain.|`|ML7FRVzIaa	Break up|`|MKHd10MYaa	Just from reading your description, my first impression of you is that you're a really good person, probably a really good boyfriend as well.<br>  <br>  From what I see it (since you said that you already tried to talk to her about it) you should just sit down and tell her. Let her know that you understand that her friends will be gone for 15 months in 2-3 months and what not, but you're her boyfriend and she has to realize that a couple must spend time together. Let her know that it's great that she wants to spend time with friends who she will not see again for a long time, but she needs to realize that she's in a relationship and she can't just push you off for her friends like that, even if it's temporarily.<br>  <br>  Tell her that if this keeps up, that you will consider a break up, possible a temporary one but who knows how it would turn out. Let her know you don't want to break up with her, nor do you want to hurt her or yourself, but you don't like the fact that she's putting you off like that.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you talking to her and hopefully you two resolve this problem without a break up.|`|zIGTzoxjaa	let her have some fun<br>  god damn dude<br>  she doesnt need to be with you 24/7<br>  go have some guy time|`|UhWQuxLVaa	just follow ur heart|`|dIw1112Zaa	I think you should just stick it out because her friends are leaving soon and it might be really hard for her. You should be the nice boyfriend who helps her instead of yelling at her because she's not giving you attention.  After her friends leave you'll have all the attention. If you yell at her now then you might ruin it forever, but if you help her now it will pay off.|`|ppWXraSHaa	Just leave her alone for a while and focus on other stuff. You don't have to break up. you just have to make her miss you. As tough as that may be, it will work.|`|rPoKRm8gaa	Too long...:( But good luck!|`|2v3l5Xfiaa	Break it up or it is tearing you apart!|`|18oPqW2gaa	make a smaller question next time|`|FkB3jQzWaa	i wouldn't verbaly abuse her. that just sounds stupid. just let her do her own thing.|`|0fbcc59fc901bca7e0ca600714a7fb88aa	You don't think that maybe she is wanting to take a step back and breathe do ya?  So far that is what the first paragraph is telling me. Its also telling me that she has the opportunity to have fun with friends before they leave and she wants to make memories, (hopefully positive ones).<br>  Getting emotional isn't a bad thing at all.  It lets us women know that you are human.  It really helps us to connect when you show some kind of emotion.  There is a huge difference between  the two of yelling and verbally abusing as to just putting your foot down and being stern. <br>  <br>  All in all?  If you do break up with her, you may jeopardize your relationship with her in the future. But if you continue on this path and eventually yell at her, you may make her see you for what you are not.  You may want to just ask her if she needs time apart.  There may also be a huge maturity level difference between the both of you.  I wish you all the luck in the world.|`|0ocU0LJ0aa	If she is into you that seriously...I think you should give her the time she needs but let her know how it is affescting you.Dont keep yourself cooped up i'm sure you have friends,go out and enjoy yourself.Do things on your own besides it sounds like you dont get much time to hang out so why spend it thinking about someone that is hurting your feelings..of course you would only do this if you talked to her about how you felt.Tell her you want to go out with her and her girlfriends you may have a good time.And as a guy express to her girlfriends how much she means to you and be sincere...believe me in all the time they spend it is likely to come up how much you love her if they feel you are sincere.But it sounds like you are leaning towards a last resort...dont do it because later on you dont want to think she is only with you because you mentally battered her...she is a person just like you and because shes a woman shes likely to feel more emotional in knowing how she is making you feel.You will be ok just be yourself thats why she loves you.|`|QUKc25Fcaa	ok this is a tough answer, because same things happened to me, and i do tell my bf wat he can and cant do.<br>  1. my ex was always with his friends, everyday all day. and we would fight and get in arguments, but he stayed with me...the thing there was he had us both over...his friends and me at the same time!<br>  2. my current bf, he keeps saying he wants tattoos and piercings, and i say "if u get any im leaving" (like break up) and he automatically says ok i wont! so im not like telling him wat to do, im saying if he does it im gone! so u have to make her wanna be with u! <br>  tell her ur going fishing or something, and u can ask if she wants to come, cause if she says no, u tell her its her loss, and if she doesnt go with u then, then u wont take her on other dates....|`|yfuJRBmYaa	hey kevin, <br>  you cant expect to spend every waking moment with  her. You need to  negotiate   your time, her time and together time. <br>  <br>  It  sounds like you need to  do more with your time, so you dont worry about  how she spends her time.|`|j8PbHQsGaa	dump her now, but more of a mutual break up, then when her friends leave she will come crwaling back and you can ball her discretely
y2XKYhsyaa	you should do it for yourself. its the number one killer.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	Yes, he will.  And you'll find that you'll think better of yourself, too.|`|3rwoKaYMaa	Yeah smoking is nasty...|`|0ktcvglRaa	If you stop smoking for him, it will show how much you care about him! I dated two guys who smoked and they never even attempted to quit for me. I wasn't offended, but I was annoyed when they would smoke a lot.|`|XwMn6aY5aa	yeah!  he will plus that means he cares about you and doesn't want you to have lung cancer in the future! throw away that death stick and make him be interested in a healthy pretty girl ^_^|`|AjPbtm7oaa	You can only successfully quit if you do it for yourself.<br>  I am a former smoker & now it's the biggest turn off in a woman.|`|cBKpDtWNaa	I think he will ..... but stop smoking for your own health........Katie|`|Voq6D4a1aa	first of all, you shouldn't be smoking at all its bad for you and its a turn off because you obviously don't care about yourself enough to keep yourself healthy. So my advice to you is to stop smoking for yourself and keep yourself healthy. Its only a bonus to get him to like you. Good luck and hopefully you can stop and get your guy.|`|ZtHmcRQ0aa	Uh smoking is an ugly thing and personally if you're only quitting for affection than thats pretty ugly too.<br>  <br>  you're an ugly person and i don't want you to date anyone.|`|a731b8aa7fc67026e29be142b6102c8aaa	Stop smoking for yourself; It`s wayyyy unhealthy.|`|85294ca7b4849e5282e9f017650e63feaa	I think he would love that. It would really help your relationship and might make him really feel like u care|`|OZbfhG50aa	why dont you ask the lump of cancer in your lungs...|`|BsjLu0hhaa	tell him that you'll stop smoking if his cousins stop bombing our country
d0WQ2pZNaa	yes she likes you, she may have been called a flirt or a slu.t for flirting with you all the time and people may have had a go at her for 'leading you on' so she stopped all that.<br>  But now, the fact that she stares at you heaps, and shows signs of nervousness around you, she obviously likes you.<br>  She asked why you don't say hi to her at school, so she wants you to. so say hi to her at school for a start.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|gCSulFhIaa	Is it possible that maybe she wasn't on IM when you messaged her? Or if she was online then maybe she wasn't at her computer. You really can't trust internet conversations, so don't read into it. But don't ignore her in school, because if she still acts interested after two years, don't risk it by acting like a jerk and ignoring her. Plus, maybe she is just too nervous to answer you back in case she says something stupid. Anyway, good luck with her!|`|ETV7yvNbaa	The only way you will get answers is to go up and talk to her about it. Ask her why she hasn't been replying. You will get your answers. Maybe she was away from her computer. It seems like she might like you, but just don't ignore her because that will give her the impression that you are uninterested! I am assuming you don't want that! Well, good luck! =]]|`|2Zoq6Lj5aa	talk to her. i kinda had the same problem. ask her what was up with it. a good way to ask without being hateful or anything is like "Hey i im'ed u the otherday, u get my message?" nothin hateful. seems to me she has an interest in you. most likely there busy doin somethin. dont sweat it though bro.|`|gNEfUvRuaa	thats so cute. but the pulling the shirt up and down is kinda weird. but yeah totally go for it. definately DO NOT ignore her!! just be like.. so did u get my aim yesterday? and then she will explain. but yeah, sounds like she deff likes u. good luck! :]|`|s8Kg0ciqaa	Ok chill.

That would have saved you from this confusion. Say Hi on Mon. and give her a good stare and act like today never happened!|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	You have one of two choices here. Walk up to her and ask her what's going on, either she confesses her intentions and stop playing with you feelings because she's driving you crazy or Forget about you altogether and find someone else to harasses.|`|46932e299a057eec247337f7bca2654baa	of course she likes u... u just screwed up... u shouldn't ignore girls like that... it confuses us.... duh :P Just say, that u had alot on ur mind or something and hook up w/ her or something... and for the computer thing... maybe she was too nervous to reply or she wasn't at the computer at that time... sometimes when the computer says i'm on, i could be downstairs watching tv.... well good luck :)|`|YeoCTM0haa	DUH. She likes you. Shes interested in you if she seems nervous around you and ask around to find out more about her. And then start getting closer to her. And when you do, ask her out.|`|IPFCtyvQaa	Dudes don't over complicate things.... girls do... if you like her.... act on it, the more you wait the more you turn her off.|`|un1ddMEHaa	maybe her AIM is online, but she's not on her computer. it's not a bad sign she just doesn't chack it that often. or she's nervous and is scared to talk to u on AIM. she likes you, it seems.|`|yROLq2l1aa	yes! she likes you!
je2j9SYuaa	Hunny! Don't worry about it too much. From what it seems, you seem really upset about this and I don't think you'll ever do it again. People make mistakes and bad decisions all the time. The good thing is that we learn from them :) You're still a good kid! You just made a not-so-good decision, which is normal.|`|bkgBLjuvaa	just apologize to the teacher .&. tell them, you won't do it again.|`|nRcSFAxlaa	don't worry about it so much. the fact that you feel this guilty about it is a good thing because then it shows that you really feel sorry for what you did. i know it's hard, but just try to forget about it. everyone makes mistakes, just accept the consequences and move on. tell yourself that you won't do it again. you really should not beat yourself up over this, i can totally understand why you feel this way and i would feel the same way but just don't do anything like that in the future. if it would make you feel better, you could apologize to your teacher and tell him/her exactly what you told us. seriously, you should not hate yourself. there are soooo many worse things you could have done.|`|r8VvBxM6aa	Whatever you do, do it for you, and not to please anyone. At the end of the day you have to face yourself, not them. Just be careful about your decisions in the future, and at least this was a learning experience :)<br>  <br>  btw i've started an advice column on youtube about questions like this. i actually just made one on self esteem that might help you out. if you want to check it out and comment whatever other questions you may have i'd be glad to answer them. :)<br>  <br>  just type in thatbrowngirl890 on youtube or go straight to the link with<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZ6cS7QtfM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZ6cS7Qt...</a>|`|8YkKLshNaa	Just don't worry about it.<br>  if your teacher didn't tell you anything it was for a reason.<br>  Don't stress--everyone has done it at least once.=)|`|WQ4hXvzmaa	oh get over it,  this doesnt make you a bad kid|`|RsBmU4pvaa	okay, well like everyone said, get over it. but i think your question is more like how do you get over it. listen to music. lol i get embarassed and stuff really quickly, so i made my own playlist that helps me get over stuff (lol, it's sad i know). it's got like that song outta my head by ashlee simpson (even tho i don't like her), and like all these songs about meaningless topics. and it just sorta calms me down. then go listen to some calm music and meditate. clear your mind. and then go to sleep. honestly, you'll forget most of the guilt and embarassment when you wake up. and everytime the memory comes back, block it out with a good memory or visualisation. The most important part is to remember that you've learnt your lesson and you won't do it again.  <br>  <br>  peace out <3|`|zDvHmIaEaa	who cares? I got caught helping a friend cheat in high school and got in trouble. Looking back now (5 years later) I'm laughing. At the time I was scared to death, but who cares? Besides whats done is done.

exEvgDssaa	Well you're obviously not going to get back with your ex, so who cares if she thinks it's revenge. Sounds hard, but you need to hate your ex in order to forget about her.

If anything, it'll make her jealous and might make her want you again...if you want that.|`|GEvnskVVaa	I think you should just go for it if you have broke up with your ex <br>  who gives a flying **** just get in there son have a pop if you know <br>  what im getting at.|`|dMjqsxD3aa	dont bother.. save the embarrasment.

BbcBTIrUaa	I agree, the second guy does sound like a jerk,or <br>  at least he doesnt sound like he would appreciate you as much as<br>  the first guy.<br>  <br>  I think the shy guy really does like you, if you catch him staring at you<br>  alot, then it should be obvious, I mean, why would he stare at you<br>  if he wasnt contemplating your beauty and fantasizing about your hugs.<br>  Also he seems to stay quite while his brother is trying to get your attention because his brother is just obnoxious and he thinks its <br>  pointless to try and compete.<br>  <br>  I would say give the shy one more of a chance than his brother,<br>  though it seems like they both like you but what would you want <br>  to happen to you if you were shy? also the quite ones tend to be more<br>  interesting.  the older one will just get you into trouble.<br>  <br>  anyways, its not wrong to take a chance with him, because<br>  you guys are not really related.  If your parents dont mind,<br>  and if you have not developed an opinion on it, then go for it.<br>  <br>  I made out with my sister-in-law, I think that it doesnt matter<br>  because its just like meeting a stranger anywhere, and if<br>  your cousin did NOT get married then it wouldnt be a problem.<br>  <br>  Oh and to get your yahoo questions answered:<br>  I just asked the question<br>  "How do I get my questions answered?"<br>  and someone gave me a very good answer so<br>  look at my profile and in my questions you will find that<br>  question I asked and some tips that someone gave me<br>  for this answer thing to be more helpful...|`|BrvrqPTnaa	hmm if hes quiet he might be too shy to talk to you. and by the sound of it the brother likes you. or maybe he just likes making people laugh, but thats hardly ever the case.|`|POfAilFfaa	the second guys sounds like a jerk! don't bother with him as for the first guy no way to tell unless you get to know him better and as for the whole being related thing its not as big of a deal as it sounds your not blood related no big deal. oh and before i forget tell his brother your not interested. fast!

Ui7WuDrJaa	Hi! Being nervous on new territory is completely normal (I used to get nervous around the guys I liked even on my early 20's) so don't feel bad, we just learn to hide it ;). But are you sure you just want to be friends? If so, you can do that by replying to one of those cute messages he sends you. If you are not sure, just take it one day at a time, hang out with him doing something you are comfortable with, in a place where you know he won't make any moves.<br>  Best
6Tj70Xv5aa	Hmm... if I had to choose a pitch I would say kind of neutral-high but relatively quiet.|`|NgeZASTYaa	a country drawl  *____*

0NcndQb8aa	start by talking to her, a simply hi and a kiss in the cheek helps you start a friendship and if you continue doing that im sure you'll have a pretty good chance in 2 weeks.|`|rkkyNwBqaa	start talking to her saying hi and go on from there please help<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ahjedc41F.PMPajnnd6EEv_AFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090306205256AA5ICtL">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>
MtQ9ea2Uaa	I really do think there is something there. I just think you've thought about it so much that you can't see it anymore :)<br>  <br>  Yes, I think he likes you. Since he hasn't dated anyone I can see how he's really shy. He probably does want to hook up with you but he probably would rather wait till you guys are committed in a relationship AND the entire shy thing comes back into play. I say there's a huge chance in a future with him.<br>  There's things that you listed that sound extremely caring and nice that even a guy friend maybe wouldn't do but a guy that was interested in you and wanted you to think well of him would do.|`|k7jInxBXaa	it sounds like there is something there, but maybe he's shy. That's my guess because he hasn't asked you out yet. I've met quite a few guys like him in the last couple of years and I've dated only 2. I was the one who asked them out and I was basicly the leader in the relationship. Anyways, deff. DON'T let go if you like him. You should ask him out on a date and I am almost positive that he'll say yes.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck (:<br>  <br>  <br>  ohh do you mind answering my question?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuIwnPXEpKZliyM9GEdr5uPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306231120AACgsdV">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|CX5RGqZuaa	It sound that he likes you and when you talk about other guys hes thinking "damn why doesnt she want me?"|`|jQhyQGCiaa	honestly, i think hes just a nice guy and would do that for anyone. but the only one to know for sure is him :)|`|Qv1zeDFvaa	Ask him and find out....WTF do we know?lol|`|urQnRQ4jaa	I think that your best friend is right!!! If he has never said that he sees you a like a sister or something like that then he likes you...and he could be nervous to talk you out since you would be his first girl friend...I think that you should talk to him maybe more serious conversations and see if you can pick up anything...hope that helps...|`|AA11080680	I honestly do not know what to tell you. You can go one flirting with him or you may be wasting your time with him than wonder if there is another guy that likes you but knows that your interested in this other guy than there goes your chance with that guy.|`|QoVsOK3Daa	Sounds like hes in to you but scared to ask you out|`|s564PQUHaa	let me be honest with you. yeah you might have something there, but the balls and the nerve has to come from you. i can tell right now from what you said, he ain't asking you out, not cause of you, but cause he's shy. so ask him out. if you have the... balls... but only guys have cahones. well if you have the ovaries. yeah. that sounds better. yeah.|`|xA1fdVimaa	there are definately signs that there may be something there (no one online can tell you that for certain - plus, we're only getting your side).  but, given the details you've listed, i'd say it is worth the risk of talking to him about it.  a couple of things that you have stated are serious signs that he generally does like & care about you.<br>  <br>  timing is everything ... so pick your moment & talk to him about the possiblity of starting something up with him.  for no other reason then the fact that you OBVIOUSLY like this boy.  life is too short, lil ms ... use good judgement, & if you think he's worth the risk, take a chance.
jfcYmke9aa	the one thing that could mess things up is if you guys got intimate. once you pass that threshold then there really is no going back so if you want to date him then go ahead but make sure that neither of you go that far. this way if it does no work out then you both can go back to being friends and it won't feel weird.|`|UYRIJ7ETaa	it is always a risk with friends but you either take the risk or don't. it might end up being a good risk|`|D87FepZoaa	I was in the same situation,i tell my bestfriend that i like him and he said he like be has a sister,but we are still bestfriend.but just say what is on ur mind before its too late and u regreat the fact that u did  not tell him u like him.|`|PMrTleDJaa	It depends on his personality.  If he's shy he would really love it.  If he's friendly and nice he would fall for you.  If he's a jerk he'd agree to date.  Any way he would probably like it.|`|PFLx104Waa	well,it depends how long u been friends with him and how u treated him so far.
pNMaWHcbaa	Love is a very difficult thing to understand for most people. It sometimes is very difficult to tell what you are feeling, or if you are confusing feelings. Here are some simple tips to see if you are in love.<br>  <br>  Determine if you have the ability to make a commitment to that person. To say, "No matter who else comes along, I will be faithful to you." That's what love is. To be willing to make sacrifices for that person. Believe it or not the sparks of emotion won't last forever. They sometimes don't last past the first few months of being together. Which is why when real love is concerned, commitment is important. <br>  <br>  LoL Hope that helped =]|`|WAoUjP6faa	there are multiple things that effect if ur in love. sometimes people think they are in love but it is just infatuation. i cant really help you because i don't know what feelings u feel. but i can tell you that its very hard to know if u in love with someone. im sorry if this isn't want u wanted but i hope it helps if u don't want to be with him make sure it starts out slow to make sure u know what ur getting into or if u truly love or like him
kvmWDuOJaa	Haha I was really getting into reading that!<br>  I'm sure it will all work out completely fine. It's early days and you don't really know each other. You'll be comfortable around each other soon enough and then there won't be awkwardness, leaving room for the good stuff!<br>  The girl who really hurt you by saying that he didn't like you was obviously just sh-t stirring to try and ruin it for you. Forget about her. She's obviously a completely retarded and horrible person to do that, so you don't need her in your life. It's her problem, not yours.<br>  <br>  Other than that, I don't really know what to say! It's obvious he really likes you, and seeing as you seem to like him loads back I'm sure it will be amazing. The next few weeks will be an exciting time cos you'll be getting to know him much better and still be in the early days of your relationship.<br>  Just don't freak out at this point. There's no need to worry yourself, so calm yourself down by listening to music or deep breathing if you feel yourself losing control. You haven't got anything to worry about, trust me, and I'm sure he wouldn't want you to be freaking out so much. It will all work out good!<br>  <br>  If you need to vent again feel free to email me. Weirdly I like listening to this kind of stuf haha!<br>  Good luck!!<br>  If I helped, could you please consider sparing a few seconds of your time to vote for my school by clicking the below link?

jlXPsVfdaa	I am far more attracted to a woman who is well put together.  The more stylish, the more attractive in my book.  I rather have a woman who is very well put together but average beauty over a beauty who cannot put herself together.|`|uhKBBQ9raa	That's why most girls dress well, to catch boy's attention...|`|565df5fe4c276dc3f59d54d1b9259380aa	Yes. Fashion is important and that is what I intend to look for in a wife. I do not want thinking just anything goes, because that can be ridiculous. I would want my wife to have a knowledge of proper dress and grooming and fashion sense. The fashion doesn't have to be the latest, but it should be modest and well-presented. School clothes work clothes should be clean and presentable.|`|uJOWhThlaa	Of course you need to care about your looks but don't over do it cause that would be odd.just flirt and be cute but don't interfere with him 2 much|`|IlSGU9Yzaa	Yes because a girls lack of fashion knowledge can distract us from the real you.|`|KCS862Qaaa	i prefer she just doesnt wear clothes at all|`|lwXGNizGaa	Absolutely, being put together and fashionable (or at least trying to look nice) is a big plus for girls.  It's a lot easier to find yourself attracted to someone who takes care of themselves and makes an effort than someone who's frumpy and gross all the time.

Take if from me, i was with a guy for 5 years, that did drugs, cheated, and refused to work.  You will get to a point where enough is enough and you will leave and get out. Mine was when my daughter was born, and he disapointed and lied to her like he did me, and I was not going to put her thru that.  Good luck.|`|0ktcvglRaa	Realize that he's a cheating, druggie loser.|`|umuaX3MAaa	shoot him dead.....jk|`|xUWejoiQaa	Think about all of his weak and bad qualities.  Think about how better off you'll be without him and remember that it's not your fault.  It takes time for people to get over things, but you could try meditation.  Ask friends for advice and they'll help you by a great deal.  Also, do an activity that will get him off your mind.  Maybe you could go on vacation or start something like painting.  Also, writing poems to express yourself helps a lot.  There are billions of other guys out there and remember how everything happens for a reason :)<br>  <br>  I hope this helps :)|`|K6egI6O4aa	Cut him out of your life! Permanently! It's too easy to go back if he's attached to you somehow. Try to make a clean break and make it abundantly clear that you are not going to take him back. It also helps to tell family and friends what you're going through with him. That way they will help support you if you feel like taking him back.|`|2f0137f09289e62bcaf3e3903473e994aa	wow ive been down that road. kinda like the guy in the breakfast club, they are so attractive yet forbidden. just find some one better. at a mall, or in your class.|`|aIC8UpMVaa	Get a dude who does not do drugs and choose someone you knew for a while or start talking to someone else you liked at one time.|`|rV4uJVWmaa	Smoke a joint.|`|eQENZXz1aa	yea that's pretty much self explanatory <br>  <br>  nice slayer tune for a name|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Get some counseling and figure out what is going on with self that allows you to feel the need to be with someone who has so many issues.

We expect respect,someone to make us laugh and just have fun......life is really easy, find out what you like and share it.|`|7sFNyeOhaa	All I know is Girls liked to be listened to unless your not the only one listening.

And make it clear to them that they are never to mention anything about your boyfriend or your relationship to you because from now you are not going to bother answering them. And if they continue to annoy you then ignore them. If you ignore them then eventually they will get fed up.|`|4tDTQOgNaa	I hate to be the bearer of bad news but if people are constantly telling you he's bad news or they think the relationship should be over then chances are they are right. I know it maybe annoying but you might want to pay attention. He may have stopped drinking smoking and ditching for such a short period of time but that doesn't mean that he has stopped for good. He maybe doing this to put up a front. I don't know but you may want to look at the options you have in front of you.|`|Hw5eIMRYaa	They just want to be single again ....... don't do that stick with him if he really likes u and u really like him ... to hell with the world let them say what they wanna say u stay happy with him and tell the world to F off !!|`|S2xWbrgpaa	If the ppl who are telling you these things really know you and care about you, consider their worries as advice. On the other hand, if you care about him despite his flaws, well then good for you!!!! Only you can say who is good for you and who is unhealthy. Hey! My friends did the same thing to me when I met my current boyfriend who drank, smoked and gambled. I talked to him and he gave up the smoking, and gambles and drinks less. In return, he is honest sensitive and an overall great guy. It got so bad with my friends though that I actually left them, and ive been with my wonderful man ever since. My friends were not willing to accept my new love, and essentially chose to hate him rather than stay friends with me. Im not saying you should go that far, but consider how much your boyfriend cares about you, and how much your friends care also.|`|dKUSJ23Qaa	ya!!! what jessica said! <br>  he took the effort to change for u and girl, most guys wont change a thing for a girl, stay w/ him and watch him carefully, take care of him and make sure he doesnt go back to that crap cuz without u he'll be lost<br>  <br>  i think ur like his lil angel|`|UYBMWmn0aa	oooohh gurll ppl are just jealous!!! i promise you! :)<br>  if u like/love him stay with him...(follow ur heart) and 5 months is a long time(kinda).....ALL THAT MATTERS IF U LIKE/LOVE HIMM...

His behavior isn't because of you or your son. It's because he wasn't given a good example on how to treat women, children, etc. His dad must have been a real azz. There are TONS of trustworthy, loving men who don't come with extreme emotional baggage like your husband. You don't need to settle!!!!!!! Oh, and your husband is the ugly one. He has no inner beauty and he will never find true happiness with anyone unless he really gets a lot of help. There are plenty of resources for women in your shoes. Call 1-800-799-SAFE or get in touch with YWCA. Don't be scared. Get out on your own two feet and never put up with this sort of disrespect again!|`|1OJgKMzVaa	Be thankful he stays away you don't need a husband like this. You have the best love of all your child. Husbands are replaceable but children are not. You husband is not deserving of the love that you want to give him.

I don't think he cares about what he has at home. He probably has someone else who is making him happy. He has treated you bad in the past? What are you still doing there? It is not about looks. Men need more than looks to keep them interested, but if you have a bad apple from the start then nothing that you do matter. You deserve to be treated like a queen. All of us women do. Take your son and go, he has already done it a long time ago. A piece a paper doesn't mean family. It's just something that keeps you tied to the misery you're in. I can keep going on and on and on, but I won't because you probably won't read it. Just leave, find a way, stand up for yourself and be strong and demand respect. We are in the USA not some middle eastern country. Good luck.|`|c07v7O80aa	He treats you badly because he's messed up. Nothing you can do will "wake him up" or change him. You now know what you know, that he's an a**hole and, although he may come home, he won't be coming home TO YOU. Put you energy into planning you life - without him. All else is wasted and is just you helping him hurt you by you hurting you even more.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	I don't know why.   Why are you still there?

This will not last. She will either know how to be a proper enforcer to teach to take your life seriously and to do good for your own benefit in life or you will revolt. Try to explain how you feel. Only you know what will be a good motivator for you to succeed and that is all she is trying to help with. But you sound like you are depress and that is unhealthy. Things desperately need to change. Find the guidance counselor, they may be able to speak to your mother for you if you feel you are unable to do it on your own. <br>  But please remember you are worth so much to her, if she is hurting you she would love to know. She hopes for you to do great with your life. And in her way this may be the way she feels she is helping.

Lemme guess, all your life you have (for the most part) been getting off on porn? If so, it seems like you've become dependent on it. If this is your problem, all you can do is try to "teach" yourself to get off through nothing but your imagination (ie. stay away from that computer and your porn collection). Maybe you'll want to wait a week or so first for the sexual tension to build up, then go for it. Obviously it'll suck at first, maybe it'll take 15 minutes to get off on your imagination (if you can at all), but after awhile you should slowly improve.|`|4e1nRQCUaa	If you are having fun and she is having fun, then "normal" should be the farthest thing from your mind.|`|m8f7rnBEaa	Try being in bed with a guy and see what happens.|`|Pswqhimoaa	probably low testosterone...|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	Then shes the wrong girl, if you get no reaction.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  help me?<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306161235AA62VP6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|J03Qy5aoaa	Maybe its because you realize sex is meaningless, and you long for something more.|`|0mcvCOfyaa	yup, that is a very open question.

lvOR401haa	Hey -<br>  <br>  First of all - congrats!!!<br>  <br>  Second of all, I lived in MN for 18months (I am British and live in the UK again now), but only in Minneapolis.  It doesn't say where in MN you live, so if it's not in Minneapolis this won't help!<br>  <br>  There is an amazing arboretum in the Twin Cities that is both inside and out.  It's kinda hot and misty in parts due to the types of plants there, but it's really nice and would be ace for piccies.<br>  <br>  Como Zoo also has a 'plant' bit which would be nice - it's like abig conservatory full of really pretty flowers and plants which lead sinto another areas behind. Plus free entry for you and wedding party (though a small donation would be nice - used to do work for them so it's somewhere I cared about :-) ).<br>  <br>  The up-town art gallery is both inside and outside I THINK (I may be wrong, I went once and it was 5 years ago now!).  This would be good for good weather too as the art pieces are pretty cool and would make for some more abstract pictures of the day.<br>  <br>  I bet there are more places, but I am thinking of places I spent time in that would be suitable!<br>  <br>  Hopefully I have helped, but if not, have a wonderful day and good luck for the future.  I recall July being HOT (I am not used to that kind of hot lol) so I doubt weather will be a problem though :-)<br>  <br>  Plus - my friend has rain on her day and she got some cool white lacey (but useful) umbrellas and had some funny pics outside using them too.  And if it DOES rain, it's good luck in some cultures ;-)|`|U3fwQPcjaa	I'm not from the area... or even the county he he, but are there any 5 start hotels in the area?

AA11515948	Be there for her, and tell her you will wait for her for as long as it takes - just be a gentleman!  And if she starts taking it further too soon (when you know she isn't over him yet), let her down gently because you don't want to take advantage of her.  First of all, if you don't it wouldn't last long because you'd just be a rebound; and second, she will respect you and trust you all the more in the long term!<br>  But keep paying her compliments and make her happy so she knows you still like her: don't friend-zone yourself...<br>  <br>  So be patient and understanding, and you will be any girl's perfect man.  This shouldn't be hard if you really like her.  The slower you take it, the more likely you are to end up together!

7PJFouzPaa	middle school is one of a kind. people actually like other people for who they are in the real world. its not so much of a status game. middle school guys don't want to admit who they like until they know that the other person will like them back.if hes confident maybe he just doesn't want to risk his image by getting turned down. if you guys get along and talk well flirt a little. touch his arm, bat your eye lashes, and laugh a lot. if it turns out he doesn't like you, you can always say you were just being friendly and hes stupid to look to much into it.|`|iOa7rriGaa	Well in high school it mostly changes but you still have the few who claim to not like anyone. My guess is they do it because either they don't want anyone to know who the really like so no one tells their crush or because if you ask them and they like you of course they won't tell you if their shy. There are a number of reason's why some guys claim to not like anyone but sometimes it's because they really don't like anyone.|`|51cd856f9c2a18d1e26ffbefc3cea6d8aa	because they are boys... <br>  <br>  besides, you're young... plenty of time for that|`|HoUdB8COaa	ur in middle skewl babez boys r so imature.....wait a year they'll get 2 be better

I mean, its hard for guys sometimes to get women like that.  And unless he has another relationship, I do not see why he wouldn't go for you.  And, sometimes guys love it when beautiful (or women that they like) are willing to do anything for them (I can tell you I would).   And I would respect your feelings.   That is a very important part of any relationship....even friends.|`|ca0f5a47cf09cbd5e44eadcb861c8819aa	LIL... this question got my attention. When i was 14 i was convinced i was in love w/ a 24 year old man. Now on my late 20's,  know now it was so an obsession . But let me tell you...i was a virgin and i did everything in my power to seduce this man. I would try to get him into bed or make out. Of course it took me two years but mission accomplished. I believe if you want a man really bad and don't give up you will succeed.|`|VN3R0I5Oaa	Yes, Once a guy is turned on u control him.|`|7An35QYPaa	Ask him if he would be interested in consensual sex in the missionary position for the sole purpose copulation.|`|jLdmFH8paa	if someone offering its better to accept her proposal think 10 times that it is good or bad.|`|OY5Ud2q5aa	No guy is going to refuse if he finds you even mildly attractive.|`|XIhGx6dvaa	Is this a trick question?
NtSQcyHLaa	I'm sorry, but it sound like he's not interested any more. He's a jerk for not saying something, if that's the case. Give it a while longer and if he comes to you and says that he was, in fact, just really busy, say it's ok. But if it happens again, then you should probably just consider quitting the situation altogether. I hope this helps, and I'm sorry if he ends up being the jerk you don't want him to be. Most guys can do that, sadly. (That's coming from a guy, I might add)|`|w5DmFiojaa	move on. you know he is hidding something from you. dont kid yourself.|`|6R18Vr2aaa	Forget him. He snoozes, he loses. If a had the balls... He would say something|`|EhQhbrMkaa	Did you take a shower before going on a date with him?|`|XyVnWc4zaa	Well if he says things that every girl likes to hear but then suddenly stops talking to you you should probably move on.  I wouldn't say that he's cheating on you (unless you yourself think so)...but maybe he's the kinda guy who has that kind of personality where he loves you and then just 'takes a break' from you.  <br>  <br>  If you really think he's busy, then try calling him up more often (not enough to be called clingy) or leave a message just saying that you'd like to hang out sometime.  <br>  <br>  but remember that it's one thing to be busy, and another to be a bad boyfriend.

vBIwaQ0qaa	I don't think it's cheating. You didn't get physical with this guy? Right? Besides, what h e double hockey sticks is emotional cheating?|`|TpJbtJCfaa	yes|`|FHrQzaPqaa	were you kissing and hugging this other guy? if not your bf has issues<br>  if you was kissing and hugging this is cheating.|`|5826c0f958be58086ad9de0d1be3724daa	this is a form or emotional cheating which everyone does. If you think another man is sexier then the one you got it's emotional cheating. If you flirt its emotional cheating. I think you need to talk to ur bf about what he thinks is cheating and what you think is cheating because people have different explinations for cheating. <br>  <br>  ps.I'd say either react on ur feelings for this other guy if ur feelings for ur boyfriend are not true|`|W618lfZ6aa	Talking is not cheating, I am very flirty with other girls and my gf knows this, but shes secure with the relationship and knows I won't do anything to break that trust. Your boyfriend is probably insecure and immature.|`|3CeJHTDqaa	emotionaly it is cheating but cheating is when you do physical things with other ppl that don't include your boyfriend.<br>  so no not clarified as cheating.|`|zIGTzoxjaa	no, that does not clarify as cheating.<br>  cheating would be if you were to get physical with the other guy or if you were to start going out with the other guy behind your boyfriends back|`|nkiwlf7Paa	I say no.  You haven't done anything like kissing or holding hands with your friend yet.  It may be "emotional" cheating as the other person said, but everyone does it, even married couples, it's harmless, but if your going to continue, at least break up with the other guy.|`|K6egI6O4aa	It doesn't QUALIFY as cheating if nothing physical happened. I don't think it QUALIFIES as emotional cheating. Lots of people develop little crushes even though they are with someone else. If you like him more than your current guy you need to move on.|`|Ke5BUqu9aa	no its not i have a freind thats married and sure we click and joke around but when shes with her husband she acts diffrentry and to her im like one of her girlfreinds but im a man may be u like her that way and know your loyal to your boyfreind........ need more imformation|`|1lUxd2t9aa	no way! you just have feelings for another guy so what? you never did anything behind your boyfriend's back.<br>  <br>  please answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306170611AAcnY93">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|RfZK3FBzaa	yes. why would you stay in a relationship with someone you don't like? esp if you like someone else. that's rather sh!tty of you.|`|vV1hPhfWaa	To clarify . . .

As long as you keep your pants on, and don't go making out with the dude. I would understand if you were spending the night at his house and spending more time with him than your boyfriend, I mean, I would be mad, but I wouldn't classify that as cheating. Now if you actually did something with him, then yeah, that's cheating.|`|rEUI5sVvaa	Okay. So did you do anything sexual or flirting like with this guy? That's constituted as cheating (in my opinion) If you like (or liked) this other guy you should have ended it with your boyfriend before continuing anything with this other guy. It was wrong, cheating, maybe not so much. It all depends on your demeanor and your actions. I hope this helps. =)|`|5PWmGqzTaa	that's emotional cheating, and a word of advice, if you suspect yourself of cheating, you probably are|`|1n6LMCS3aa	If thoughts were cheating, then every dude who looked at porn while married is cheating.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  To answer your question, no it is not as long as you did not do anything to him|`|ppWXraSHaa	Yea its cheating.

Y5rK9zQAaa	just start talking to her about how her day was and casually ask her if shes doing anything saturday or friday night. don't think about it too much. i have a friend thats a guy and he kept rehearsing lines and silly stuff to ask a girl out and he got all nervous and screwed it up. just do it casually, don't make it a big ordeal. and don't ask yourself "what if" like "what if i mess it up?" that just brings your confidence down and makes you more nervous to ask her out.|`|WsLqPvcHaa	well, first off you should let her know how you feel about her. then if she feels the same way, make a move... but noting that'll scare her off.|`|98LDN0Quaa	take her to dinner or a movie..something she wants todo...*even if its lame* then if it goes well...which it will...ask her then|`|uS1PLDYVaa	just be yourself! go out somewhere were you both like and just ask her out. im sure she will open up to you straight away|`|BEEX2G8Iaa	Well I felt the same way to.

I dont think he doesnt like you anymore. its tough being close friends with someone you dont have classes with.

Set a day to hang out with you, him and maybe a couple other friends so its not so awkward.

entB7tPQaa	How old are you? You sound young. No one as young as I assume you are is 'the one" thats just a stupid thing girls think and then they get dumped and heartbroken. Sorry to rain on your parade. I also don't think you should go out with this guy, unless you want to lose your friend. Be a true friend and ignore him because to date him right after he breaks up with your friend is a reallyyyy b****** thing to do.
THiWa3Imaa	im nice, but quiet too!<br>  <br>  it means you are a nice person. a very nice person. like you are well mannered and polite and friendly and nice to be around. the "but" part just means that your all of this, and not really outgoing. your quiet and more held back. its ok. your probably just shy. <---thats me. lol<br>  <br>  =]|`|0btrijJCaa	Isn't he saying your a nice person but can be too quiet (not a bad thing by the way)|`|uRbeSOMwaa	your nice, but are very shy and don't talk that much.<br>  another word that might describe you is 'innocent'|`|yzrOahBFaa	Sorry, but i dont know how to put this in a better way. But this means that he thinks you're a nice girl but too quiet which often means he thinks you're uninteresting. It sounds like you like the guy; so sorry to say this to you. But this is the truth.|`|QYaWJu8vaa	Nice, but quiet sort of means nice but not interesting. Many guys equate quiet with not interesting or boring.|`|jN4Eprtxaa	by but he means also he's not saying its bad that just what the phrase is
2c88J3M7aa	Wow, your brave ! =)<br>  Hmm maybe you should hint about it on aim or something, or just come out one  time and say it be like "I hope this doesn't mess up our friendship but I really like you - like more than a friend" or something<br>  Good Luck ? =)|`|RyRLahS7aa	I'm in 7th grade too! :D<br>  <br>  Just ask him "will u go out w/ me?" on aim. Make sure he doesn't have a girlfriend already. LOL.|`|caraDLHTaa	om gosh heaps of people in year 8 go ou with yr 7s at my school the same in other grades as well just tell him<br>  just say to him that you really like him and you wanna go out with him and see his reaction aplus if you want things to go a bit further than talk to him in person not just on the net <br>  ok hope i helped byebye|`|e36555cb5eddc5c5eff104279c80ed5baa	Well, you walk up to him and say "I really like you".  <br>  <br>  It's simple.  It's easy.  And, it's too the point.
1V1r6il7aa	Talking about grant taylor?<br>  Ha Ha
WKBVrHhbaa	Well I'm a girl but with experience on this....<br>  <br>  he has a history with this girl, and that means alot. He might get back with her, unless she really broke his heart and he wants to have nothing to do with her. <br>  <br>  Honestly, stay away from him, if you don't want to, then stay alert sweetie...the chances of you getting hurt are really high. You couldve been his "temp" and now that his ex is back and available, he'll choose her over you.<br>  <br>  Be careful
c2jTBSn7aa	Yeah. Well heres one thing you got to know. Friends before Girls. You should talk to your girlfriend and tell her. "Hey,look. No need to be jealous of friends name here______. Im with YOU. Its like telling you to get rid of your best friend. And if it makes you feel better..." And tell her a funny joke or something about your best friend. Something your girlfriend does that your best friend doesnt. Like if your girlfriend loves colorful rainbow socks. (This is just an example.) Tell Her. "She doesnt have an interest in weird colorful fruity socks." And give her a nice grin. And if her jealousy continues on. You should give her up. If she cant trust you around another girl. Can she really trust you about anything at all? But this is just my own opinion on this.<br>  <br>  Ps - Thanks for answering my question. :]
He5OH4b4aa	I would say outgoing people because they are too shy to make any kind of first move on a person, so they get together with an out-going person who asks them out first or whatever.<br>  If its two shy people neither may get the guts up to say anything. I actually saw this happen with my friend and her crush. Clearly both liked each other, but neither one ever did anything about it.|`|y8dTsfdxaa	cause sometimes opposites attract|`|eAIapfXsaa	They probably end up marrying introverted people.<br>  If one person likes to go out and socialize a lot, while the other one doesn't, I think that would probably be a big problem and result in a break up.|`|Rq5dEYwOaa	Sometimes it's true that people attract others like themselves, like if you're shy you'll be with another shy person. But I think that sometimes shy people can be with outgoing people. My older brother was 19 when he moved in with his girlfriend who was 17. They both got married a year later. My brother is a shy guy, his wife is very social and outgoing and parties. They're now both in their late twenties and are still very much in love.
79632f5cafa59cc02272fe8777999b37aa	My voice is like that too. I reckon shout real loud and it will come off to them as talking slightly loud.<br>  Hel* you are allowed to be depressed and that does not mean everyone should frigging well stop talking to you. that seems a bit harsh.<br>  Just try and force yourself to talk a little more I guess.<br>  Orrrr you could go the one on one route. Pick the one you like best and maybe suggest getting together for a coffee or whatever. Then they cannot ignore you cos you will be the only one there. Then gradually this should help you insinuate yourself back into the loud group as this person could be your allie after all they know you are not quiet anymore cos they had coffee with you.<br>  To be honest I think they are being kind of rude.|`|RYiSYJvTaa	Ok what I think is that you should write your friends a note and tell them what you feel and what you think about it. And also, you should give them a phone call to start talking again. Another thing, is to go up to them and join in with the convo. That way everyone is talking and having a good time and your not left out. Trust me, I have been left out before I think everyone has. Also, you might want to check out this website to give you great tips and advice. Good luck and thanks for asking!|`|U61wyMDNaa	Are they worth being friends with if they don't like you for who you are? Even through bad times, if they were good friends, they would help you through it. <br>  <br>  I'm really shy too, by the way. Don't try to force yourself to change unless it is totally and completely up to you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and sorry if it sounds offensive, I don't mean to be.|`|W20xtX5oaa	sounds like they aren't really good friends, realy friends would know that something was up and would have asked you about it.<br>  keep trying to talk to them, and if it doesn't work i think its time tot find some real friends|`|LOfZNNdfaa	It's simply stop being shy.  All you got to do is..........wait why am I talking to you?  I DON"T WANT TO TALK TO YOU!
StJGeiFyaa	go for it. don't punish him or yourself to what ur ****** ex did. good luck :)|`|u5HmOfhRaa	give him a chance|`|EumQhRTgaa	It seems by what you have told us the chemistry is there. If the chemistry is there then what's stopping you? Ha ha. I think you should just go for it. What do you have to lose? You both seem to have a lot in common and make just an absolute perfect match, so go for it and when everything ends up perfect your going to be so glad you did go for it.|`|Sl4Vtxwiaa	well it seems like he cares about u from what you're telling us. but on the other hand, he knows that you're hurt and vulnerable and that u need someone  and maybe it's all an act to get closer to sleep with u. consider the only two options carefully.|`|FLpgOAWMaa	hey, just because he's ur ex's best friend, that doesn't mean that he is like your ex. and hell, why not? you only live once, so make the best of it. and even if it ends badly, would you rather live your life wondering what if, or would you rather take a chance and maybe be the happiest you've ever been? my advice is to go for it, and hope for the best!
2uxaGUNqaa	This question isn't really clear. You could be talking about someone with large breasts, or someone who works at HooterS. But whichever, girls with large breasts aren't just interested in one type of guy, they can't help it they have big boobs. And someone who works at hooters, just ask them? But I wouldn't hold my breath. Walking around a restaurant in booty shorts and a belly shirt, I'm sure they have many other guys going after them.|`|AA11620807	It's gonna sound trite or sarcastic, but there's a one word answer to your problem. the word? "MONEY"  you'll get slapped for tryin to buy sex from her, but all women are after is to land the best "fish" they can catch.    money, status, power, whatever, Women SAY they're after love, and some are but try getting a date by being a penniless nice guy.
cn5ecUmEaa	i know its not easy to dump somebody u like very much but she probably deserve much better then that guy..if he is ignorant then he is not going to change anything but his underwear... so tell your friend she just be going threw the same thing all over again if she dosent cut him..|`|BEdpwFsWaa	Give him some time, he's probably on his man period.<br>  If things get worse, tell your friend to break up with him.
mtwxVpnWaa	It depends on what your girlfriend is like, but you could always burn her a cd of songs that remind you of her, her favorites, songs that are special to both of you, etc.  <br>  <br>  Hm, or maybe if she likes taking pictures, you could make a little collage of pictures of you two or something like that.<br>  <br>  I think she will like anything you give her, but that's some things that were on the top of my mind.<br>  <br>  Hope she has a good birthday and good luck! :)|`|AdL8Y4X1aa	a scrapbook that u made with pictures of you two<br>  a mixed cd with songs that you dedicate to her<br>  a list of 17 reasons why you like or love her and make it a detailed list|`|vmauRjsIaa	17 roses.<br>  a teddy bear with a big head.<br>  and a pretty necklace or bracelet, with a carved pendant.<br>  (hehe, eclipse... =])|`|iCBTVyPWaa	diamond ring neckless and card with money kiss and exotic sex if she wants it .|`|LiscSv5Oaa	A nict wristwatch will be good|`|4v2ZTZvAaa	u should make her a cute video or something. . .sorry i dont got many suggestions , good luck tho!!|`|89RviNLBaa	a vibrater always works beast
l1FfxlwAaa	just ask him who he likes<br>  *|`|mLsP2M0taa	show signs that you do like him. the way he reacts will give you the answer|`|9Bu7ioEhaa	OK.<br>  <br>    You might want to get classes with him and try to stay around him a lot.  Get him to notice you, and talk to him directly, like you don't want anyone else to hear you.|`|ayOWrkNtaa	just casually go up to him and say "what would you do if i asked you out?"<br>  <br>  he will say "why"<br>  <br>  then say "just curious" until you get the answer u wanted|`|3EM66IWFaa	May be he wants one more sister
o4fykobbaa	IF she has somewhat of an attraction to you, i think it is possible for you to win her over. Its all about how you portray yourself to her from here on out though, lol, being that i'm a girl, i know these things. First off, you need to stop paying her any attention, bc she is getting an ego booster from all the attention you are giveing her, and at the same time, she is gettting turned off by you being obsessed with her, so therefore, maybe if u start showing interest in other girls, however not to one in particular, BUT TO SEVERAL, she will start to take interest in you. When you play guitar, flirt with all the girls and pay no attention to her what-so-ever, bc for soem reason even for me, when other people like the person i don't like or that i like somewhat, i start to really really show interest in that person.<br>  <br>  ps: the older you get, the more you will start to realize that 11s on a scale of 10 are actually not as hot as you see them physically. Personality does count if a sexy hot ***** is a *****, why would u want to be with that person?!?<br>  <br>  haha, u dig?|`|9en6c7cRaa	1. Yes, I'm sorry though.<br>  2. No, I don't suggest it. You see, girls are fickle, so just ignore her for a couple of days and she'll realize that she likes you and if she doesn't then don't talk to her any more.<br>  3.N/A|`|7LpuNEqlaa	Try 2 b her friend and just get 2 know her. Make her laugh a lot|`|1wyYntWeaa	sorry bro she obviously knows you like her if you sang a song you wrote to in front of those people(that takes balls) She wouldve made some definite signs, or if she liked you she never would say you are creepy|`|As8Q0exgaa	awww thats so sweet that u wrote her a song. if she says that ur creepy after it then shes not worth it go find someone better.|`|oYlX1rgMaa	Umm if she is telling her friend that you are creeping her out or whtev then you should back off at least for a lil bit. maybe even flirt with someone else so that she sees that its not just her you flirt with. but yea don't freak her out! after like a week start talking to her again but take it slow. and if you ask her out then wait and give it time cuz now is really not the right time to be asking her!<br>  good luck dude!
CjamvYzKaa	FYI never type in a question saying "girls only" because all guys would be to curious to kknow what's going on!! lol like me :D|`|1dVoVp1gaa	no theres none|`|kJy0KwBOaa	Not a girl...we all can't be so lucky...lol<br>  <br>  Internet situtation/problem???<br>  <br>  As in omg...I might need law enforcement?<br>  <br>  I've been working on an Internet safety project.

vFldqvN4aa	yes lol im not super shy in fact im very outgoing just not when im around my crush lol so we just text and talk on the phone.|`|9a506c84f370dbf2fecea59b04578a36aa	Man, i need more info to answer this question. It's hard to tell you based on what little you gave me. However, if you think she's giving you all the signs and everything but is just being shy and immature about letting you know then maybe you ought to make your feelings more known so she won't be as afraid to show hers. Perhaps she is shy becuase she doesn't know if you like her back. If your ballsy, go ahead and tell her you like her if you're pretty sure she likes you back. Then, if she's not stupid, she will admit her feelings for you knowing that you have the same feelings for her. Make sense? Good luck.
0NkWwOsPaa	Of course, all girls are sweet and sensitive on the inside. She may just be a really strong person, who doesnt take bs off of people. But dont not talk to her because she seems tough. It may take alot for her to fully trust you and for her to talk to you period, but in the end it will be a good relationship.
CFPSVMJIaa	u could try acting normal and pretend that shes another person, u tend to act different around ppl u like so if u acted normally she may c u as a different personality then she thought, and be sure that u just havn't convinced urself that u like her more then u really do|`|eObzadUhaa	you're in the friend zone, for sure.<br>  but there could be a way out.<br>  stop liking her.<br>  or at least pretend like you don't like her anymore.<br>  but stay being her friend.<br>  when she thinks you're over it, she'll automatically wonder why.<br>  she won't be able to stop thinking about it, basically.<br>  it usually works pretty well.<br>  reverse psychology and all that.|`|8SRjELNBaa	***** your in the FRIEND ZONE, there's no getting out.|`|e28afc3a2533a60ee5465b6b8d794962aa	Simply just hang out with no expectations, be her friend. You never what could happen, give it time and you will know.
qSRsqWqpaa	You're a cute kid, so you're probably intimidating them (not scary intimidating, just looks wise).  That and they're shy.  <br>  <br>  Try talking to him.|`|41S75G5Eaa	happens to me too (kinda) lol<br>  maybe they just think you're pretty<br>  and don't know  how to approach you|`|7CAUiE0taa	Of course he's shy us guys are very shy and we just don't understand women. My suggestion is for you talk and comfort him. Make him comfortable around you and he will open and sooner or later you will guys will hit it off if he had a thing for you. Don't be shy to ask questions and such, just because your a girl doesn't mean you have to be shy too.|`|Qtha4ZjHaa	There's nothing wrong with you there just being shy truthly i would be to|`|3F8v8bgQaa	whoa girl you are very hot. you should hit me up sometime|`|Pi4tU2Pyaa	You are so pretty! <br>  Sometimes guys can just be stupid!
qxgkhN8aaa	Hi, it depends whether you already know what you like or<br>  perhaps, do you have the money to do what you like.<br>  <br>  Sometimes when we get bore with a lot of things as what<br>  we like we didn't have a chance to play with it.<br>  <br>  For example, though I don't have the physical to play what<br>  I like, I only will enjoy extreme sports,<br>  things like XXX movie did. By Vin Diesel.|`|xp4mhkqgaa	Go out with your mates.  If you don't have any, then try to meet more people, and take up any offers of socialising.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes I get lazy too, and don't go out in a while, but it becomes a bad habit.  Just decide you're going to have a night out at the weekend, or whenever, and call up some friends and go out for a few drinks, go to a club, or whatever it is you like to do.  And, make yourself go out every so often.  <br>  <br>  It does become boring staying in.  I've been doing it too much recently because it's been winter.  But, the weather is getting better, so it's time to get back out there :)|`|b34a54682dc09f70279f26554322d78aaa	Go out ... go dancing .. enroll yourself in a yoga class/rock climbing/dancing/poetry/whatever floats your boat class.

You never claimed him.|`|NVg06Egwaa	Hey I <3 the JB too!! SO MUCH. Ok, well believe me, you're NOT alone! I've had this happen to me O so many times!!! It's sad. And I know it's hard to get over, but I always think " I can't MAKE him like me. How would I feel if he MADE me like him?" <br>  <br>  Just become good friends w/ him, so he knows u'll be there after him and his gf break up.|`|G4pmbc0Qaa	He doesn't like you.

Otatq4LTaa	I'm sorry but I think you should try to get over her it doesn't sound like she's going to be interested anytime soon. Try playing the field a little bit or talking to more girls, your feelings may change. (:|`|DNQnhxntaa	go for the jackpot

She probably just wants you man up and give it to her strait. none of this theatrical stuff.  Next time just f*** her and make it rough.  Also don't call it "making love".  <br>  <br>  From what I can tell you're really clingy, she's right to say you're annoying and that you never give her room to breath.|`|Y1npBMS0aa	i think that maybe you should back off that way she does miss you and she will start to appreciate you. if she likes a different guy during your "break" then shes not really all that loyal to you. you seem like you would deserve better.<br>  <br>  good  luck:) you sound like a good guy!

The only time I mind is if it's one of my wife beaters, (undershirt) she has giant boobs and they make boob marks in them. lol Whats wrong with boxers? Boxers on chicks are hot. Easier access, if ya know what I mean! lol<br>  <br>  3. Whats wrong with putting lotion on her? Some times it leads to other fun things!<br>  <br>  You're not too young to be wondering thoes things, I got married when I was 18. What a mistake that was. Technicaly, I'm still maried, but we sepperated 2 years ago, and I'm with someone else now. Take my advice, wait 'till your at least 25 before you get married. It changes EVERYTHING. It's like as soon as you sign those papers,  things get more and more rutine. And be carefull about getting pregnant, unless you see yourselves staying  together. Just listen to someone that has been threw it. I had 2 kids with that chick, now I never see them. Just be wise about the choices you make. But, to answer your question, no, your not weird, everyone does that stuff, don't they?|`|HfdtsEkUaa	1 is okay, #2 wouldn't bother me, but #3 is a little strange, I don't think I would do that.|`|66fMJo6raa	1.yes<br>  2.my wife sleeps in my shirts and i dont care<br>  3.yea i would|`|NlYGbqnkaa	Its really funny to me that at 16 this is what your concerned with when it comes to being married. Believe me when you co-exist with someone there are so many other things to worry about. But, I took a shower with my wife almost everyday. I used to put lotion on her back quite often (usually as part of a back rub) I didn't do this everyday simply because there wasn't time. As far as wearing my clothes to bed... we usually didn't bother with clothes. It wouldn't bother me if she did. There are several other things you constantly do for each other that are done everyday that you didn't mention. Little things like getting up at a commercial while watching a tv show and asking the other if they need something while your up or packing her lunch when i'm packing mine. There are so many things that you do for each other the key is to never take the little things for granted.|`|8iCzrsGmaa	I would do those things|`|b5FcU8zpaa	Everyday I would take a shower with you. let u wear my clothes and put lotion on you!!|`|6Tj70Xv5aa	1. Of course!<br>  <br>  2. nope, I wouldn't care<br>  <br>  3. If she didn't mind it, yes :P<br>  <br>  Ps- I'm 17 almost 18. <br>  <br>  But I actually don't think it's weird you would think about marriage or being with someone. You're not the only one at that age who does, I guarantee it.|`|dqbUp4nGaa	Yes, of course - besides, everything you mentioned is just small stuff.  And you are very, very wise to put more thought into the honeymoon and the rest of the marraige than the wedding day - it is amazing how many people - men and women - who live for that day and then say, to themselves, "Now what?"  or "What the hell did we just do?"<br>  Read a book called "Getting the Love You Want" by Harville Hendrix.  He explains why we choose the partners we do, and his explanations make more sense than ANY other relationship book I've ever read.<br>  Good luck!<br>  Oh, and by the way, NO man will make you happy until you are happy with yourself, being by yourself.  Any other way won't last.  You're there to support each other, help each other, laugh with each other, not emotionally rescue each other.<br>  Good luck!

zzaScg0haa	This is so long I don't feel like i can give it the attention it needs|`|tK7XacH7aa	Okay, I'll use this question and the previous one that you asked because now I really understand the situation. <br>  <br>  You need to let him know that you want your friendship to be non-touching and that you want him to be at least 4 feet away from you (more or less depending on what you think) Just tell him that you want this friendship to have no touching whatsoever. Tell him that you don't like him asking so many questions and that you want to have some alone time throughout school. Instead of him asking questions about you tell him that you'd rather talk about things. If he's been depressed and hasn't talked much then asking questions is the easiest way to start a conversation. Although they normally don't last that long, which is why he continues asking.<br>  <br>  From what you've said about his depression I can connect so I hope I can understand him (except I never thought about suicide). Right now, backing off won't be the best decision because it does hurt a person more because they become more confused. Try to get him to know more people. If he has become more social, then it'll be easier for him to open up. Try to get him to meet people and actually talk with people. For me that's still hard and it really depends on how much the person is willing/trying to meet someone new. If you are his only friend then you have to get him into a group of friends otherwise you really do mean a lot to that person. I can say from experience. Get on chats like on Facebook or something and get him to talk with you other friends and see how well he opens up to other people and not just focuses on you. Do not feel guilty if you are trying to come up with a solution to the problem. Just don't avoid him. Also tell him some that there are some days where you just want to be by yourself. That you don't mind talking to him, but that you really just want to hang out with your girlfriends or just be by yourself to just not have to worry about anythng. <br>  If he hasn't had any friends until you, then he is a very independent person. If you say that you want to just be by yourself for at least twice a week hopefully he can understand. It all depends on how willing he is to change. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  P.S. could you please turn on your email so I can contact you more on this. I can relate to this guy so I may be of some assistance. Just let me know if you need any help.
FZKFLTyLaa	1. She seems pretty flaky and immature. Sorry, but that's what I'm reading here.<br>  2. Your parents do need to loosen up.<br>  If I was your age and my parents treated me like that (note: from the way you express yourself you SEEM mature) I'd be making some sort of move toward improving this situation.<br>  What are they gonna do to you if  you go sit on the porch if you WANT TO? Beat you or something?<br>  I'd figure out some sort of protest against them, seriously. I'm for kids obeying their parents, but GEE!<br>  Maybe you should act like you're 4 years old around them. Maybe you should just shun them, ignore them when they talk to you without actually "breaking their rules." When they ask you what's up, just tell them you're acting out against what they stand for.
sQBcIcAnaa	I think you should keep in touch with him  but just remember  and don't be surprise that he starts dating a collage girl  if he is for real you will know  by what he dose  like he knows you don't drive then it is on him to come and see you  <br>  <br>  if he starts making excuses why he cannot come see you then it is time to get out he could probably be cheating
R2hbZi1Faa	You have to give more information about this...I mean why did he tell you  that he's secretly dating some other girl? Are you that close? Perhaps he said it to see your reaction - sort of to MAKE YOU tell him.<br>  Maybe he just said it for no reason and if you tell him you like him - could turn out to be a bad idea...you don't want to scare him off. <br>  Maybe if u tell him this like you're making a joke about it. See his reaction...if you notice that he's not too happy about it just say - Oh, come on, just messing with ya or something...<br>  Hope it turns out ok. Good luck anyway!|`|qAVADb9vaa	I told my good friend that I liked her, well actually my friend told her, and to this day she wont talk about it with me. everytime i ask about it she plays dumb like she doesnt know what I'm talking about. ultimately, if you think he might like you back, then yeah go for it. but if you think that it could ruin your friendship if you tell him, then dont do it.
PWS0x8Gwaa	Facebook is pretty casual so you should be fine... did it take a LOT of searching to find him?<br>  Also, is he on your friend's friend list already?

Good luck!|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	connect to him on facebook. sometimes I get friend requests from people I don't ever recall meeting. I reject those, but most people would rather have a bigger friends list. Either way, he has met you, so you're fine.<br>  <br>  Once your facebook friends, you are under no obligation to actually message him. Perhaps he'll message you. If you're looking for an excuse to try and start up a conversation, then I would suggest say something about volleyball, since that's what you two were both doing when you met, and it's obviously a common interest.|`|HuVfzU06aa	Doing that isn't creepy, facebook is a social network.

mfcVhbYhaa	Why did you guys break up then if you loved him that much ?<br>  Apparently he likes you too if he really spends that much time with you. You just can't spend that much time with a friend, it's absolutely love.<br>  <br>  But I am afraid it's pretty complicated with him having a girl already. It's critical at this point that you shouldn't interfere because he might not respect that and it isn't any decent actually.<br>  <br>  About your boyfriend, I admit it's been too annoying for me too when I used to see my girl friend only twice every week. and in your case, it is even harder, I guess. If I were in your shoes, I would just give it up and draw back. Enough wasting your time with such a relationship if we can say that.<br>  If you agree with me about your boyfriend, I think it would be helpful to tell your ex about your current relationship and how it is getting worse or may you would break up soon. That may make him think of you both together again...<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)
TCZz2OKvaa	Willingness to fight for what is right is nice.  Men don't like bitchy women but they admire women of principle.  "Fight evil" = sexy.  "Fight men" = turn off.<br>  <br>  As far as looks, not every guy likes every girl.  Don't be hurt if one guy isn't attracted, the next guy might be.  It's important not to let your looks go, of course; you need to be somewhat "put together."  Same thing for guys:  try to stay in some kind of shape, wear decent clothes, and for girls, light makeup skillfully applied.  Then just be a nice person.<br>  <br>  Actually, I think the best thing to do is get involved in some kind of group.  Then you'll meet guys who are interested in the the same activity, and things will just kind of happen naturally.  If you like music, a lot of guys have bands, and if they had a girl in the band, well, that might just be the sexiest thing ever for them.  But remember, a lot of guys start bands because they think they look geeky and they're just trying to meet chicks.

You have to take the first step, though, and force yourself to talk.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER- **There are some ways to let him know you are interested without actually talking to him...<br>  First off- eye contact. But when they notice hold the contact for a second and a half more, THEN look away. <br>  Do this a few times.<br>  <br>  But see, eye contact only goes so far... Sometimes you gotta build up the guts and just go for it!|`|KJAKihaCaa	Confidence.<br>  <br>  Girls are always in groups giggling together, squealing, just being annoying.

When he looks at you give him a little smile put let the other girls do your work for you by making themselves look like stupid air heads.<br>  He will notice you.|`|7CAUiE0taa	I love this question because really 90% of attractiveness comes from our body movements.

NaKW0E5Baa	My Dad calls me "Princess" all the time. Always has done. I'm 24 now. He doesn't have a pet name for my brother.<br>  <br>  Mum called my little brother "Babe" or "Bub" until he was about 11. Then he got really upset at her doing it in public. She still does in private though, and he's 16.<br>  <br>  She also calls me "sweetie" or "darling".<br>  She also calls my Dad "sweetie" and "darling".<br>  And you can't think it's ok for a mother to do so, and not a father. That's sexist ;)<br>  <br>  It's a term of endearment. He's probably calling his daughter "Babe" because she's his baby, and he loves her. That's all pet names mean, that someone is special to the person using them.<br>  <br>  He's just cuddling with her when he's hugging... Depends on the child's love language whether it's OK or not. If she's a physical girl, and likes hugs, that's good. If she's not and another love language (and you could tell this about her by how she shows love: doing things for others, hugging others, buying gifts for others, or saying nice things to others) then you could tell that to her father, and say that you've noticed her love language isn't physical (as I imagine his is - or word related) and ask him to maybe praise her in a way she'd appreciate more.<br>  <br>  I'm confused about the humping comment? Does he hump his daughter, or hump you? If its you then there's no issue... If it's her, well, that's a SERIOUS issue.<br>  <br>  I understand that you're upset about your daughter, as you have right to be. But different families show love in different ways, and maybe the way your boyfriend shows love to his daughter and family, while not being perverted, is just not right for you.|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Babe is also short for baby. The girl is his child, his baby. Babe is just a shortening affectionate term for baby. I doubt he is a perv, in fact he sounds like a doting father. Maybe that is what really bothers you. If you cannot deal with it then perhaps you should date someone else. Making a man feel like a perv for caring about his daughter is cruel. Men cant even look at any female anymore without someone suspecting he is a perv.|`|AA10757358	Personally I think it is wrong.  I have also heard father's call their daughters "girlfriend".  A father should call their child by their name - honey is OK|`|25sTuyULaa	No, I don't think there is anything wrong with it.  I have a 31-year old son that I call babe all the time.  I also call him baby, sweetie, darlin, etc.  A parent calling a child by a pet name should not be considered weird or deviant, unless the behavior toward that child is strange or abnormal.  I think it's very healthy and helps the two to form a bond.  I know that my son and I are very close.|`|zZdF5qUIaa	I think it's probably okay, although my dad has never called me that (and it would seem kind of weird if he did)...My mom has called me that before but she probably wouldn't dare to call my brother that...I guess I see your point. I've noticed in the Hispanic culture, men call their daughters that more often so maybe it's a cultural thing???
VSXUa9lraa	Flirt.<br>  Talk to him.
A8kFnvw1aa	Beauty is on the inside. Take my mom for an example; she says (but I don't think) that she is not beautiful on the outside, but she is totally beautiful on the inside. Everyone she meets, and I mean everyone, down to the cashier at the grocery store, will tell you that she's beautiful because she treats them all with courtesy and respect. She's really nice, does nursing for a living, and (in her own words) has that "special touch with people" that makes them look at her with admiration. I can tell it makes their day better.|`|aVGnsATJaa	you need to provide more info like pics and more details because saying your biger then other girls does not help me decide weather your ugle or not because theres guys and girl all different sizes and still good looking|`|js58iOmAaa	well let me put it this way, i am a 15 year old guy and only 5 2, but girls like me. I am going to be straight up with you. Guys may not like you because of other things, which i dont know if you have because you did not go into detail.<br>  <br>  First off, there is no excuse for a girl to not to be well kepy. Short, Tall, Big, Small, Black, White, i dont care. A girl who wants guys to be interested in her should be dressed well and look like they care about their appearance.<br>  <br>  Second, i am not trying to be mean but a lot of times bigger girls are quick to insult people because of their size. For example, there is a girl in one of my classes that is big, and all she does is insult people like me and my height. no one likes her because she is a b****. There is no excuse for being mean to people, no matter how big you are.<br>  <br>  Third, do not bring so much attention to yourself. Like i said, i am short. the more attention i bring to myself the more oppurtunities i open up for people to call me short or recognize my height. If being big bothers you, and you feel it is the reason people do not like you try not to stand out or be the one who is the loudest or funniest, this will only bring unwanted attention in the long run.<br>  <br>  Finally, there are tips for bigger women. if you are bigger in height, trying wearing horizontal stripes and two different colors in your outfit, one color for pants and one for shirt. This will make you appear smaller. If you are bigger in body weight, try wearing dark colors, and one colored outfits, this will keep a constant eye image and will not seperate you body in sections, making you feel smaller.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped|`|8cN4e8Vmaa	I've seen BIG girls with thin handsome men and I don't understand cause I get left with the "weird" ones? I don't know what it is about me that attracts them? haha Yeah its your confidence. Seriously that's all. Smile put on make up that looks good on you (don't over do it) dress pretty. Don't wear stuff that wont look good on your body profile. Have self respect and keep your head up that's all. I'm chubby too and i know what I can and can't wear.|`|rULYGvz9aa	Post pics, you're either ugly or you have a bad personality.|`|f4K08k0Raa	you just stated the problem its not how you look its your confidence..|`|9fqCbmUTaa	definatly not. you just need to be confident... i know, its really hard, but once they see that you are great fun and they get to see the real you, then they will start to want to get to know you... some of the most beautiful people I know are bigger. It just depends on the person!!! (:<br>  I hope you are able to  give off a confidence even if you just pretend and inside you still feel shy. I do it, I am so shy, but I just pretend to be confident haha <br>  good luck and remember don’t worry about what others think. Everyone is beautiful in their own way (:<br>  bye bye x|`|vuf8Y8I3aa	Just because your bigger doesn't mean your ugly. It shouldnt matter what they think anyways, eventually you will find someone who will like you. So dont be someone your not ok? (by the way - I think guys are jerks, so im just having fun to pass the time until i meet someone)|`|b733f6d70469e1993c15a54c325797f9aa	Most guys do judge appearence...<br>  <br>  but, as long as you can charm them with your personality, then nothing eles should really matter.|`|6pu9jNZ1aa	post pics
EN1GgC43aa	You are better than him and he doesn't deserve someone great like you. Just tell him I couldn't control my feelings but now everything is over.|`|ptActoJ7aa	omg! thats way rude! okay what u need to do is call him, text, or talk to him in person and regain ur friendship to a sence where u guys can feel comfterble around eachother again!|`|wUQG3lZDaa	Find out why he stopped talking to you. Talk to people who talk to him a lot and have them ask questions for you. Or, go up to him and ask him in person. I don't know what to do about the fact that he's going to Arkansas though... you should just try to stay in touch with him so he knows that you're still there for him when he needs help.<br>  <br>  Is he embarrassed to talk to you in front of other people? And is he moving away just cause he has to or if he wants to?|`|EuLpNMtGaa	hi nichloe friend i waana to give a suggestion that be a friend with him and ask the details that what type of girl he want and if he had a worse things try to change her  and u can be change some what according to him attitude if he did not listen make up own life  with person whom u like<br>  friend
MtQ9ea2Uaa	If you have to ask yourself (and us) this, if you've considered it, then yes, you do like him.<br>  <br>  1. Love is a STRONG word! So instead it should be "like". I'm guessing yes. Here's your clues: "i look at him so much differently now. i don't no y. it feels like my heart skips a beat sometimes. he has an amazing smile and his voice is pure." <br>  I definitely think so. Pretend someone else wrote that about a guy. Does it seem like she likes him?<br>  <br>  2. YES! Before it's too late for good. And he moves on. Again. For good!<br>  <br>  3. I don't know that and it's not too obvious that you don't either. Only he knows. You have to figure that out yourself.<br>  <br>  4. Next time he mentions his latest crush bring yours up! Just say, "Yknow who I think I'm liking now.." This can also work if he asks you about who you like. Or you just feel like updating him on your latest crushes like you guys usually do.<br>  <br>  Chances are that he likes you. Most friendships between a boy and a girl end up liking each other. Chances are he's thought about going out with you and probably even developed feelings for you at one point.|`|urQnRQ4jaa	One I think that you like him I don't know about love yet...you liked the idea about him being your best friend and helping him but now that you know that he use to like you and you thought about him that way you like what you see...two I think that you should tell him especially if he can tell you are different some how...three you will have to ask him if he still likes you some how...four if you really tell him so much i think that you should just tell him the truth and not beat around the bush...what i would do was say i think i like you or some thing like that...hope that helps...and i hope that everything works out...|`|lTsONvwQaa	tell him that you might have feelings for him but you are not sure and see how he feels about it. it sounds like he likes you. and face it if you didnt like him you would not be writing this|`|10VL5ennaa	Hmm maybe seeing him with someone else has made you realize that you have feelings for him... or maybe just seeing him with someone else makes you want him because you can't have him. But from the way you're talking about his voice and smile kinda sounds like you love him lol.<br>  Before you say anything to him you have to make sure you really do wanna be with him... if I were you I would wait until he is single or whatever because if you say that you like him and he's seeing someone he will be put in a difficult situation of what he should do.<br>  But that's just what I'd do...<br>  Good luck I hope it works out :)
0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	They certainly seem to have it out for you. If his family has their hooks in him like that, and he's not standing up to them as a husband should, then it might be best to simply cut your losses. Go for child support though, it's his responsibility.<br>  <br>  That's a fight you won't win. Let the courts decide about the child support.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Ya think? The Economy is bad, and sorry, but its about to get worse for illegal migrant workers. Most cultures sit there and rag about us being racist/sexist, then turn around and are 10 times worse than their baseless accusations. Cut your losses and divorce this bum. There are people who can and will help you.|`|c07v7O80aa	He chose them over you. He showed you. Then he told you. Doesn't matter if he thinks he loves you. Start planning.|`|y21VcTjDaa	Bill C said it best.|`|RPhla0R7aa	How does his ethnicity influence him leaving you?! I think its just the influence of those horrible people that have it bad for you. IF he loves you he'll do whats right and if it is necessary bc of his work then move and get an apartment where he's at. Maybe he just gets lonely and feels that your not helping bc you complain about his brother.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	wow, i am so sorry you're having to go through this. If he wants a divorce then give it to him. If he wants to stay there with his brother, then let him. Its a race thing, that's all it is! I can't believe that she would let a 3 month old baby go hungry, that is just pure child abuse. If it were me, I would have socked her in the jaw for it. I have the same problem, my sister in law lives here with my husband, daughter and I. She won't let my daughter into her room and she pushes her out and shuts the door in her face. She's only a baby, and Loves her Auntie Jen. I got really pissed once when she pushed her away and said "No, go away, I don't want you." Then I replied, "well this is her house more than it is yours, so if you have a problem with her, then get the f*** out of her house."  If his family can't accept his children, then that is truly offensive, and I would make sure to let him know that, that those are his children and they are half hispanic. Those children didn't ask to be here and if they want to treat anyone badly it should be you, because they are their family and they should treat them as such. I'm not saying they should treat you badly, because no they shouldn't. I'm sure you'd rather take it so your children didn't feel like outcast in their own family. I will make sure to keep you in my prayers honey and I  hope God shows you the proper path.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	I wouldn't encourage your husband to quit a job while waiting for another job to open.  The economy sucks and you're already having financial hardships.  Deal with it.  Don't visit him there if the in-laws are that awful but your husband has to do what he's got to do to help support the family.|`|YMgm99gdaa	*shakes head*  Wow...|`|AA11080680	Wow what a trip. The economy has hit everyone hard. It sounds like your husband choose his family over you. For what reason, I don't know. However I do know that you do not want him back in your life. Him and his family treated you and your children horrible. Why would you want to be around people like that. You deserve better. Do you have family or friends that would be willing to let you stay with them until you get back on your feet? Also you need someone to talk to or talk this through with, talk to people at your church or a good lawyer or you need some counseling.<br>  Remember you need to take care of yourself to be the best mommy to your kids.
4u2wUsiDaa	well.......I think you should just not worry about it.I had the same issues when I was in school but I didn't sweat it and I found plenty of other friends. I sure that your a pretty cool person and you shouldn't worry about people liking you. If you be yourself and the person still likes you then you've found yourself a real friend.|`|3EM66IWFaa	First of all try to realize the reason why your friend hanging out with others.
sPvhK9eLaa	maybe your single because your not confident in yourself? you have to learn to love yourself before anyone else can =]|`|WKBVrHhbaa	you're ok, for my taste and opinion
Dbr0MO3Vaa	I know this isn't what you want to hear, but if your parents have made up their mind and decided to move you will be moving, i'm sure they are saddened that you are un happy but they have to do what they feel is best. And although no one will ever replace the friends you have there you will make more, you won't like them any more or any less just differently!
2nGa3N38aa	*zzzzzzz*  oh...oh  im sorry i fell asleep reading your question. but  you shouldn't expect things that you do for him to be returned to you because you think it's the right thing to do. in essence just chill if he likes you like that he'll get back to you|`|za2IxgALaa	don't worry, it's gonna be alright... just hold on there, hun... !<br>  <br>  nothing's bad gonna happen...... for sure :)|`|AA10250918	Honey I don't think this is a "situation". I think you miss him and maybe are having some trust issues?|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Maybe it's a trust issue thing, maybe because he never replied on what he was having it made you think he never ate at the restaurant at all, or that he was there with someone else. Just relax, and give it some time. To me it sounds like yes, he could be hiding something, but you never know it could be a great surprise for you. If it continues then I would say worry. If you love this man, and trust me, I've gone through some tough situations with long distance, try 10,000 miles, a phone call once a week if you're lucky. Not seeing them for year, and wondering if there are any women over there. If you feel deep down inside that something is wrong, then trust your instincts and do a little lookin around. But don't do this and expect not to find something, don't look if you don't want to find something disturbing. If you find nothing you will be relieved and your trust reinstated.  I've always said, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. So try to do your best and not be blindsighted, do what you need to do to protect you and your heart.<br>  <br>  I knew for a very long time that something just wasn't right, and after 3 years found out that he had cheated on me. I should have listend to that little voice that God gave me.
5agXk9ldaa	first if you are good ;)|`|mDMnhqwdaa	second or third, but never kiss on a first date is stereotype..it's all about the chemistry and when you want to/whenever you think it's right.|`|LHhds2tQaa	I got a kiss on the cheek the day before I asked her out. And we made out the day I asked her out. <br>  <br>  It depends on the girl. And shes not a whore.|`|BXXNFPUTaa	every kiss begins with kay.|`|eeHgm5hGaa	if your really nice to her 1 and sometimes even zero|`|t6azk5sUaa	Depends on the girl.|`|Y0NALNzyaa	4 was the most it took and that bothered the crap out of me.  Second date works for me.  When he doesn't go for it on the first date, it's kind of sweet.  But if it's after the third date, I'm thinking what's going on with him.|`|s564PQUHaa	alright, most of the answers say it depends on the girl. NO totally WRONG. it depends on YOU, the DUDE asking. YOU determine whether or not you will get a pleasant kiss from her. the best way to make it happen:<br>  <br>  Go google David Deangelo. he's the bomb. no i'm not david deangelo.|`|p6zDSNnVaa	depend on girl, and age<br>  <br>  some girl's might be to shy, some might not, some might not know how to kiss yet (even though its nuthin to it)|`|JjoLo4e1aa	1, you get your first kiss at the end of first date, but if your lucky or she is easy then you might get more|`|QoVsOK3Daa	i have seen it all..<br>  one time i almost had sex with her in a movie theater haha<br>  <br>  Another took weeks<br>  <br>  so it all depends on the girl|`|FBSOBz0zaa	Idk,just kiss her xD|`|6pu9jNZ1aa	Don't need dates if she's a whore|`|qca43wgkaa	depends on the girl and when she feels shes ready
vEBfp8yHaa	I was like that too - somehow I never ended up killing myself and I'm so glad I didn't!!!  My life suddenly turned around - In college I became super popular, I met a hot, smart guy and we got married!  Life is so amazing right now and I can't even imagine that I was ready to throw it all away because of some losers who I don't even care about!  tell him that these people are lame *** holes and that soon enough he will not have to deal with them - just be patient - don't kill yoursel over something that will eventually pass!  Tell him that you need him, because all he can think about right now is that people hate him.  Tell him that if he kills himself then you'll do it too and he'll have two lives on his conscience!  tell him to just stay strong for a little while longer becuase things always get better - if he's on the bottom there is nowhere to go but up!|`|Ad5DlqfPaa	Call a mental health professional ASAP. In the meantime ask him if he has a plan and if he gives you detailed info about how he plans to kill himself then this is one sign that he is very very serious. If he does  not have plan then chances are he is crying out for help and those who love him have a responsibility to help him find this help.|`|Bm5TLWgdaa	this all too bad. a big thing youll want to do is make him keep talking to you. get his closest friend. have that friend open up to him so hell do the same back. that way you keep his nervousness down. then, talk to an adult. his parents, get help close. dont let him get out of your site. then you need to assume the position of getting him to a hospital for help in calming down.|`|dTxwbooaaa	I had the same problom but i went up and kicked the dude that was teasin me in the nuts and he aint mess with me again. He needs to go get some help or something if he sounds serious about it. I would try to hang out with him alot and try to change his mind about it.|`|44fgRAeqaa	You should tell him that he shouldn't listen to them. Your born. You live life. Your time is up you die. You should be thankful you have life. Cause' you'd never get to experience it!|`|AmPQYTC3aa	If he seemed happy 2 days ago, he probably was.  Don't actually count on him killing himself: wait 7 days, and then take him to a psychologist if he still wants to die.|`|DDIZsZWeaa	DONT LET HIM!!!!!!!!!! DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER TO STOP HIM CONVINCE HIM OF EVERYTHING HE WILL MISS MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER IF YOU HAVE TO EVEN IF HE SAYS DONT TELL ANYONE TELL A PROFESIONAL BECAUSE HIS LIFE IS AT STATE!|`|wiDW2Dtbaa	no one likes to be teased<br>  maybe he just being depressed<br>  i'm sure he doesnt really mean about that suicide thing<br>  maybe he just wanted to let everyone know that he was hurt all the time<br>  tell him that you understand his pain<br>  n ask him to share them with you<br>  that will comfort him|`|9KDE7v7Haa	He should move somewhere_ if it's getting too much that he doesn't want to live anymore, he might as well try living another place first. If then he still want to go ahead then there's not much you can do..good luck.|`|0VqXYmiTaa	Tell him that he shouldnt care what people say, its stupid on how people sometimes treat others. He needs to focus on the people that care about him, andd that want him alive|`|3EM66IWFaa	if a man decides to kill him self even God can't resist him. then if a man doesn't need his life why should we bother.|`|9JAadroiaa	ur friend was very mad.that is not bad|`|896be109453cf76b326ad27023084d3caa	Since this is really a serious matter, a proffesional therapist should be told ... that's it!|`|ayOWrkNtaa	make him feel guilty-that sounds mean but it works.<br>  <br>  tell him all about how his family would feel, how you would feel.<br>  someone committing sucide in a family can make his family very depressed and life will be hard, he will be cutting a slice out of thier hearts.<br>  <br>  then tell him how much everyone loves him.|`|epHk7Fb9aa	tell him to think about how his family and freinds would feel after he did that. and if he didnt succed the first time he would have to live witht that his whole life. you should really let an adult know because no one person can handle this. and teasing and bullying can hurt evennt the strongest of people. tell him that by killing himself he might just be giving the bullys exactly what they want. taking your life is never the answer in fact you should listen to streetlight manifesto "a better time a better place" ill put a link to it i think that it will help him alout.|`|rIFqv8nvaa	I felt very much the same way throughout school. Was constanly picked on, growing up a native in an all white town, and beat up a few times for it. If he is really serious he may require counselling. Keep a close eye on him, if he persists, tell your school counsellor, principal, and his parents. Personally, i just saw the good in life and being an atheist i would prefer life to endless nothingness. Do not keep this to yourself if it persists! My friend hung himself in his closet because we all ignored the warning signs.|`|2nGa3N38aa	bi-polar maybe ? he's in alot of emotional pain and needs immediate help, please tell his parents or someone you trust  to get him the help he needs before it's too late !!!!|`|XADP739faa	Seriously you have to watch him, even the people who you think are the happiest in the world can commit suicide just like that.

y3cp05Pgaa	ok i was going to say you were too young but... it looks like i am going to help you with your problem. your just going to have to break up with him it really sounds as if he doesn't like you. Even if he does you like someone else and dating someone for pity is wrong. Remind his friend that it could mess up the friendship with the guy your dating. but hey it can't be your fault you like who you like and no one can change your mind for you. Just take a deep breath break up with your boyfriend and try the other guy. If it doesn't work out it's ok. <br>  (please vote me best answer!!!!!!!) good luck!!!|`|svXtmpvNaa	I'm sorry but you are too young.

Don't be  trying to grow up so fast.|`|zYgD1jVJaa	You don't know what love is till you get to highschool, what your "feeling" is a crush.|`|mMSVmDr2aa	I am 13 and I would lay back awhile and focus on friends!|`|BltBopVgaa	Well first off it seems like your boyfriend is playing you and he is being very shady;if he wanted the relationship he would act like it.This displays his immaturity and lack of input/dedication to the relationship.Before you think about dumping him,talk to him about whats on your mind and how you feel.But on your part you shouldn't have asked his best friend if he liked you because if you want a relationship to work both people have to be faithful.Two wrongs don't make a right.He is using you to show you off and  is just with you for the title.Don't let your friend determine what you do with your relationship.Dump the boy and start to talk to the other kid.Don't move too fast though.|`|sMsKzTZTaa	im 15 and i still think im too young to be in love. and you definatlyy are. you need to be more mature and know what love really is to love someone. its not love that you have for this bot it sthat you like him alot. and i know how you feel bout having bigg boobs cuz when i was twelve i was a b cupp.|`|wRHhpanmaa	dating? honey you are wayyy too young lol.<br>  <br>  what do you do see each other at recess?<br>  <br>  you have your whole life ahead of you, and honestly since you insist on being in an adult forum, and trying to put yourself in adult situations, i will tell it to you like you are an adult...<br>  <br>  slow down. girls that try to grow up to fast end up pregnant by age 16.<br>  <br>  honestly.... you dont even know what love is..... <br>  <br>  so be a good little girl and go and watch hannah montana like all the other little 12 year olds....|`|co3kk4fYaa	wow. i love this guy who is my friend but i don't think he likes me back... i would break up with your bf ( i know, i would hate to do that too, but don't waste your time.) and, not really date the other dude, but just be great friends and maybe later you can get together or something. i wish i could help more... this is whey i hate these questions, they're so damn hard to answer!!!!!|`|PJZRGsc3aa	pffff, like you know love<br>  it's pure lust. <br>  Stick with your current one. Life is too short to get all tangled up in relationships<br>  and unless u pumped yourself with steriods you have | in 6th grade<br>  <br>  just another fyi, what you're saying is that a 9 year old girl could have breasts the size of a 20 year olds. LOL|`|QP8LdPLeaa	omg a little daycare kid dating already! what was i doing when i was 12? oh yea i was watching power rangers!!|`|20dfea55369b7c48d3aa2ed4fee31352aa	Your 12. Your too young to even know what love is.|`|JO3HiGfHaa	Biggest "bust" in 6th grade huh? I bet my chest is bigger then yours and I'm a guy.|`|rkoxkAPDaa	First of all, you have no concept of love.  You can't even spell committed and break up correctly. And yeah, I am going to say you are too young. You're immature. He's immature. It's not an insult. It's a fact. I was too at your age.<br>  <br>  Love is unexplainable. It's unconditional and ever-lasting. It's throw your self in front of a bullet to save their life. There is a fine line between love and lust, yet the barrier is immense.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love</a><br>  <br>  You have no idea what love is. And guess what, the chances that your "boyf" does, is even more slim. And that's been scientifically proven, kiddo. Females process emotion with both hemispheres of their brain, while males only use one. That's why guys don't understand women as well.<br>  <br>  You're going to look back on this in two years and you will feel so ashamed and you'll feel like a fool. So don't get yourself all wrapped up in this because it's so not real, and you are so way too young.<br>  <br>  So f u c k i n g what if you are 100lbs and 5ft5. NEWS FLASH: It has nothing to do with the development of your brain. And just a side note, girls can start puberty at age 5, so that just goes to show you how much you know.<br>  <br>  My best guy friends (who are 16, 17, 18 and 23) don't even comprehend love and they all agree with me that you're not in love. (yeah I asked)<br>  <br>  Anyways, forget about those guys. They are far too stupid, girl. Give them like 3 more years.
xl7Ifj2Maa	I was in a very similar situation. My boyfriend wants me to go to his house sometimes, but I just tell him, "not tonight.." if I don't feel like going that day. He'll understand. My boyfriend and I talk about a lot of stuff, and we are really good friends so he respects me. If your boyfriend doesn't respect you, then he shouldn't be your boyfriend. If you don't feel comfortable going, then tell him. Maybe when you get to know him more and trust him then you guys can do so. Good luck.|`|BCgp7GTpaa	you obviously dont sound comfortable doing it so I wouldnt.|`|d6c1c9b41cdd7f1278ae2d338064377daa	if you don't want us to tell you that you need to tell your mom you have a boyfriend. what advise would you like. do you expect us to tell you sure go ahead to your boyfriends house.you wrote that you have done this before and don't want to do it any more. well it sounds to me that you do want too, your just looking for someone to say sure go ahead. well it wont be me. stay home where you belong. and your not mature enough to tell your mother about this boyfriend then you are not mature enough to be sneaking out and getting your self in a situation you may not be able to get out of.|`|WlHXOIenaa	If you don't want things to "get outta hand" then guess what?  You don't have to let them.<br>  <br>  Decide...right now...how far you will let things go.  You are in control of what you do.  If he's trying to push you to do anything...it's time to get a new boyfriend.|`|AA10232243	I find this stuff kind of funny. The new generations bring so many new issues to the table that just never existed in my time. If two people wanted to f*ck they f*cked, otherwise they wouldn't. Case closed.<br>  <br>  Do you want to have sex with him or not?|`|PhPwAGVNaa	I think you answered your own question when you said "I don't want to t do that anymore"
xVKEVGUZaa	Why would she call you and do that? What an immature mom. I suggest that you find out why, if you didn't know all that. Did she tell you it was over, or did she make you tell her son it was over? You just need friends and to talk to them, it works and you could probably just met new people who's moms don't control their lives. I mean, would you want to last with someone who's mom seems like a total *****, anyways? But if you want to, you could get back with him secretly. But if he doesn't know that his mom called you, I suggest that you tell him. I REALLY REALLY suggest making friends or hanging out with the friends you have to take your mind off of him.|`|sMsKzTZTaa	first of all thats fuckedd up tht she would do that. and if i were you i would of said fuckk you im not breaking up with him. but it will get easier as time passes to get over it you just need to spend time with your friends and do stuff to get your mind off of himm. and you should really talk to himm about what his mom did.|`|4gVgujsXaa	No one can "make you" do anything. Call your ex bf and get him back. His mom can't decide hsi relationship with you. Good luck
fovMmVBYaa	Please remember if you decide to do anything that everything has its own price.  Never leave birth control up to someone else, always use a condom and remember that if you have sex, nothing is guaranteed so you could be a father at a very early age.<br>  <br>  That said, this is what I think about your relationships.  Examine them to see what is missing and what you really want in a relationship.  Then talk to the girl you have been dating and discuss those things with her.  If you decide to break off your relationship with her, then you can explore the possibility of a new relationship with the girl who like hugs.  Hugs, however, are not necessarily a sign of wanting a bf-gf relationship.  Some people like to hug, some like to kiss their friends, others prefer to keep a distance.<br>  <br>  As a high school freshman, you have to decide how you want to live your teen years and do think about the costs involved.  Some people pick out their spouses in their teenage years, they grow together and have a wonderful marriage - but others do not succeed because they make the marriage commitment a number one priority in their lives.  <br>  <br>  Not that you are planning to marry either of the girls, but this is your time to discover what you really like in a girl and what it takes to make a relationship work.|`|9a506c84f370dbf2fecea59b04578a36aa	jesus christ, son. third base with a senior girl and you're already looking for fresh booty? i'm assuming by this whole new chick in the picture thing that you are over this senior that you are dating (atleast i hope this is the case..) and if i'm right then you need to dump the senior (no more senior booty for you..wah wah..) and i guess if you like this sophomore chick then you should just pursue her some more. But please, don't try for both at once. You're a freshman, for god sakes, and you're not quite the sex god yet. Nice one, though, scoring a senior girl. Most freshman I know look like they are eleven.
qMnuRO50aa	I think it's completely normal to be more confident online than in person.<br>  <br>  When you're face-to-face, things seem much more intimate, while online you can be anyone you want to be.<br>  <br>  Plus online you have more time to think about what you're gonna say, since no one expects you to answer instantly. In person, however, you're much more in the spotlight and have to be quick on your toes to keep an interesting conversation going. If you hesitate even a little, everyone immediately labels you as "awkward".<br>  <br>  I think maybe he feels like the person he REALLY is is undeserving of you, that maybe you're "too good" for him, so he is trying to convince you that he is more than he really is, just to make you jealous and/or make you consider him to be a feasible future love interest.|`|Qv1zeDFvaa	First off he's uneasy in person because it is much easier to sound cool if 1) you don't have the chick in front of you<br>  2) you have all the time in the word to come up with the perfect answer.<br>  <br>  He likes you, but he's playing stupid mind games all teenagers do|`|Bm5TLWgdaa	hes self conscious in person, but can talk and be big online because your not there to see how goofy he think he looks.  here  is my thing. life is short Hun. and if you don't take the chance you will never know.<br>  my saying:<br>  go crazy in your life or let your life drive you crazy.|`|HMzUeqTmaa	He could or he just might be like you said " the awkward guy". I know though that when i am around girls that i like i am am completely relaxed, he just might be the type that is different|`|LDBlXyjqaa	Yeah he likes you!  By being a jerk and gloating, he's trying to make you jealous, even though he pretty much already has you, and by making you jealous, he's trying to get you to want him.  But, if he's a cocky jerk, just ditch him.|`|AA10687516	Run.<br>  <br>  He likes sex.  And talking to you online is easy because he really has no feelings for you at all.<br>  <br>  You're better than anyone who talks to your about his other conquests...everyone is.<br>  <br>  Move on, Move up and the find a guy who knows he's supposed to bring you flowers...not because you told him to or because he wants anything, but because he knows that it will make you smile and that's enough for him.<br>  <br>  Run.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Vote for best answer!|`|AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Why are you waiting around for him? I'm assuming you both are over 21 since he mentions the bar.

Many people can tell you what they did or what they would do ---but you are the one that must decide.<br>  It is to bad that your parents feel this way--but , then again, maybe if you told them the situation might turn out differently.<br>  I wish you alot of luck .|`|szVvf7Nkaa	I think you really need to think about this and figure out if now is the best time for you to tell them. Your dad is a preacher so he won't accept that you are bisexual. And your mom already told you that she would disown you if you turned out gay. I can understand your frustration because you need to come clean with them so you can move on with your life. And you know by telling them you could be losing your family. It is going to be very hard for your dad to accept this because he's already preaching against homosexuality but don't forget he is your dad. You dad may not accept that you are bisexual but he loves you and that will never change. The same thing goes for your mom. Your mom loves you and I don't think that she will disown you. <br>  <br>  It is very hard for me to tell you go ahead and tell them because I don't know how old you are and I don't know if you are still living at home. If you are living at home and if you are not 18 yet then I would advise you to wait until you move out. And if you are more than 18 and not living at home then I think you are old enough to know what you want and then it's best if you tell your parents. It is better for you to tell then for them to find out from someone else. Your parents are going to be furious and disappointed in you but this is your life and never forget that they love you and eventually they will come around. Good luck.

xUWejoiQaa	What you're feeling is completely normal.  Maybe you could e-mail or talk to him on the phone.  Think about him.  Is he really worth it?  What are his best and worst qualities.  If he has just been causing you problems, maybe it's time you let go.  If things don't turn out to be the best, just remember, there are Billions of guys out there and everything happens for a reason :)|`|fb3aad21d8783ffe3b227fd0b9240204aa	ur not crzy u just need another guy in ur life to get ride of the guy who went to mexico|`|AnfbrZFuaa	You're fine. don't worry about it. talk to him on the phone, facebook, any way you can. It should be easier to tell him now that he's in mexico because he's so far away. try to visit each other as much as possible. if he doesn't like you though, move on. still keep in touch with him, just find someone else. it's not good for you to be in a long distance relationship. trust me, it's not fun.
UEMzV6uXaa	I don't really know how to help you, but I'm 18, and I've never had a boyfriend either...|`|eQENZXz1aa	bad taste in guys you hang out with|`|71204fadefeb0aef75f4761be2bfbc09aa	Hey!<br>  I'm a guy and I did a study on height. One of the common things with shorter people is that a lot of people think they are younger and immature, so they don't take them seriously.<br>  There's a lot you can do to deal with this. Firstly, a mature layered haircut can make a cute face look older. Secondly, the kind of clothes you wear can make you look a lot older or younger. Thirdly the way you act around guys will change how they see you. (I'm not saying to flirt 24/7 though!)<br>  I have loads of info on this sort of thing- like what clothes to wear to make yourself look older and even taller. So if you want to talk more you can contact me through my profile.<br>  Simon<br>  ;-)|`|OdvWnBC8aa	Maybe it's the way you act when you are around them that makes it hard for them to see you as anything else but a little sister.  I don't know though.  Anyways I never had a boyfriend (over a week) till I was 20.  We've been together now for almost two years :)|`|nCRUnCJxaa	never had a bf either and  im 19. shoot. and mm black guys. haha jamal crawford, baron davis, nelly. haha<br>  <br>  maybe the right one hasnt come by yet.|`|FzFSzilmaa	show off more skin and be assertive with guys you want to sleep with... ;)|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	Put your guard down. you remind me of someone.. i just dont know who....yeah just do that:)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306161235AA62VP6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|WNzBmpyraa	Don't change a thing....when I was a teenager I had the same kind of attitude with boys my age...I was even told that I was "as flat as a board and as skinny as a nail" [ouch that hurt my feelings]...but when I was 18 years old a young man loved me as I were and we got married and had 3 children and have been married for 27 years. Someone will love you just as you are.
lHWJljNPaa	Tell him....just make sure you confess when they're not together.|`|eQENZXz1aa	save yourself the headache if he keeps going back to her then even f you date he will end up cheating with her|`|7a70fb3c44b029e3904dc31c1edd79c3aa	i think you should forget it. i understand you like him but  you will set yourself up for hurt if you go there. these two obviously are not done with each Other  and anyone who they date in between is just passing the time till they get back together , do not torture yourself like that!
7ot3Rqgpaa	Ask him why he showed it to you and more importantly was this a picture that he took of some girl's breasts because if so then you have a bigger problem. What is he doing taking pics of girls tatas? He seems very immature and I have to agree that you should break up with him. When you walked away did he follow you and try to console you. Because if not, that should tell you that he just doesn't care.|`|5UJSX3vJaa	i don't like giving advice to underage people don't want to get sued <br>  <br>  but yours seem harmless enough <br>  <br>  I think you over reacted i don't think he did it to break up with ya i just think he was showing you something he thought was funny <br>  <br>  your friend said is here-say <br>  <br>  accept apology and go from there|`|Qyt5uoq4aa	Tom: I think he's just a hormone raging boy!  Everybody makes mistakes in the beginning and if he wants a second chance you should give him the chance to do better in the future.  Forgive 7 times 77 times.  But if he's actually seeing this gurl, you should end it.<br>  <br>  Greg: when you get older you'll look back on this and realize you can do better and you don't need this guy.|`|QLji3RCLaa	That guy is a douche. Dump him. You're only a teen? Good, you have loads of time to find someone so much better.|`|RqFjvfKbaa	you owe him an apology for smacking him. guys like that sort of things<br>  either live with it or ask him not to show it to you|`|xOTPS2qDaa	ask him why he showed you that and ask him if he really loves you
BbT3DCHvaa	just move on to better things.  She is right if you guys are meant to be then maybe sometime in the future it will find its way.  For now, move on.  Keep yourself busy with friends, family, hobbies, even a new girl.  Good luck!
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	for things to work out with an ex...you two will need to work on the reasons why you became ex's in the first place...|`|48BGp8Njaa	Okay. For starters, he is your ex. Key word: EX. of course things won't be the same between you two. If things aren't working out, maybe it's because you two are so stuck on what USED to be you're "perfect" relationship. But as u have figured out, times changed. So if you think you can fix this and it's 100% worth it, then give it a shot. But if you don't think is is, and its a waist of time... It's best to end things now, instead of when they get real serious.<br>  Best of luck!
ugRN86bYaa	Once I felt like that, broke up, and regretted it. That doesn't mean you will, though. I think it depends on how long you've been thinking that. If it's been several months, I'd say break up. If it's been a few days, you might wait it out a while. He'll look a whole lot better on another girl's arm. Just be careful.|`|HdVHfVhRaa	That happens with people you get tired of the same old thing. Maybe sit down and have a talk with him. If he's being sorry then just forget him and let him go, but if he's not talk to him. Don't let him go if he's good try and work it out. See if you can try and work it out.|`|5PWmGqzTaa	tell him that you need to go on a bread (about a week or so), and while your on a break if you forget that your dating him, your hearts not in it and if your hearts not in it why do it?|`|Qnrkpvmeaa	so u only hate ur boyfriend for benig wit him for so long.....y r u sick of him too does he annoy u well can u give more information|`|reFCzUnwaa	You know what!!! when you feel like that its good to take a break and be single and clear your head|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	break up with him.
kxUigIkraa	It's actually a really good thing. The fact that he says he likes you, but doesn't want to date you really shows how much he respects you. Because you are right, it sounds like he is in player mode at the moment. I dated a guy once in high school who was like that. In the situation, I was kind of the initiator of everything. It was fun and then it kind of fizzled out. Later, I found out that he was actually cheating on a serious long term girlfriend with not only me, but several other girls. That was pretty shocking to find out. Just take it as a compliment that he respects you enough not to suck you into his stupid games, and move on to someone who is ready for you.|`|0ktcvglRaa	Why can't you just listen to what he said? He obviously likes you, but DOESN'T WANT TO HURT YOU because he's GOING TO COLLEGE. Is that so difficult to comprehend? Also, he probably had his own reasons for ditching that girl at prom last year; if it concerns you that much, you should ask him why he did it.<br>  <br>  Also, what does any of this have to do with using you for sex?|`|v7fsd02Naa	ok, so if the stories people told you is true, he probably regrets what he has done in the past, and thats why he said he couldnt get hooked up with you because he doesnt want to hert you, so thats why he insnt ready, plus hes going to college.|`|0sI33S9Kaa	he likes you|`|uoKgJW2daa	it's a trap<br>  hes a loser<br>  get out before its too late|`|kHLWDgmIaa	I THINK MAYBE HE REALLY LIKES U|`|VLmOtoEyaa	i know cuz thats what i do, he wants to have sex then leave. go for it if u want a short relationship, but its not going to be anything over a week most likely|`|rV4uJVWmaa	I would just sit back and watch season 1 of Laguna Beach on Dvd. Then maybe it would make better sense.|`|NYH28cyraa	he's definitely afraid of commitment|`|S7uGTirdaa	do what your heart tells you to do

VNWnaKD9aa	its true sometimes! depends|`|WFFXHFfVaa	I think your friend prob mean try playing hard to get, this dosent always work, my advice would be if u like him ,and he likes u, why mess about?? just go for it lifes too short to be playing silly games|`|AA11899313	Question:  Why 'play at games'?<br>  <br>  Yes, maybe, or No, maybe not.<br>  <br>  Pulling away could result in him thinking you are signalling that you are not interested, No?<br>  <br>  It could result in him 'chasing you further', but then again ...maybe you are signalling that you are not interested, No?<br>  <br>  Why play games and risk problems?<br>  <br>  Sash.|`|WyLm1HmZaa	Well there's this guy that I really like and he likes me, and like, we'll be flirting and he'll say I'm not allowed to leave and he'll grab me from behind to keep me from leaving, and I'll pull away and he just pulls me closer.<br>  <br>  It just depends on how much he likes you.  It can be considered flirting but it can also send him the wrong signals.  If he looks upset because you did it, just go up to him and give him a hug. <br>  <br>  :)|`|feb0df556be60b6ae1592e3a13327aedaa	Yes, but also depends on how much that guy likes you, Some might take that as a hint that your not intesrted, and they will pull away too lolz|`|bimwlw0qaa	i absolutely agree with Acckmed|`|hNFtO9vXaa	usually when u avoid the guy that likes you he usually backs off.. but that's not all guys.. some guys wil just think you are playing hard to get.. if he's  not giving up you need to tell him how u really feel.|`|ovBNlMTsaa	yes if you play hard to get he'll want you more, if you make it too easy there's no challenge and its boring|`|vNXBZbZyaa	My nose makes bogies.
SFUM3Jgvaa	Maybe he's just a genuinely good guy.
0ktcvglRaa	And yet your best guy friend hurt you by going out with your girl, right? Some friend.|`|h7KrFGZBaa	Don't go out with her right away. Think about your friend first. He's probably like butt hurt. If he's okay with it... I guess you can just go out with the chick.|`|iCWKhbJSaa	Okay, first of all if you are going to get with this girl you need to wait at least a few months before dating her after she breaks up with your boyfriend. How long were they dating? He needs to be completely over her and then you need to talk him about how you feel. Who is more important to you? Because if he says no, you will have to choose. Trust me, waiting is better, if it is meant to be those feelings will still be there. Right now, just be there for your friend after his break up.<br>  <br>  And this is beside the point, but why would you want to be in a relationship with a girl who looks for other guys while she has a boyfriend? She is trouble. I would advise to stay away.|`|7AVMS7Mpaa	First off the girl isn't worth it man if she would say something like that. She basically meant you are her back up: basically a pad to catch her in case she falls. For your best friend, if he knew you liked her and still asked her out then I would reconsider his status as your best friend. Somethings bros don't do to other bros. And that is one of them. But if he honestly did not know you liked her, then I would suggest moving on from the girl and finding someone else.|`|VD694WY1aa	Stay out of their relationship and let it runs its course. It may be that you will lose out completely with both of them - and if that happens, it will be sad for you for sure, but better than cheating with her while she is dating your friend. I say don't interfere with their dating and stay out of it|`|JH9u8VaRaa	i'm sorry but that is really weird. first of all, if she really liked you, why is she dating ur best friend? and secondly that would be a messed up thing to do to your friend
rEWVy1Sraa	Well no matter the age all women love getting flowers so your best bet would be to get her a bouquet of flowers, hope this helps.|`|0tKNkAMuaa	flowers, sweet and then she can tell everyone you gave them to her! good luck!|`|MQVmh5hiaa	trust me roses and candy never gets old for a girl.|`|SHEhwsUaaa	i am a 15 year old girl, and i would want something from the heart!

Or pay attenchion to her really close. What bands she likes, what movies she watches ect. Maybe get her an MP3 (If you can) or just take her to a movie and buy her a cd that she would love. x-)|`|GsiO38baaa	Im 15 and if you sang a song for me even though u cant sing tht would make me happy.I would always remeber a boy who did tht for me.|`|q5BYljxZaa	You could get her roses, candy, a teddy bear, a bracelet, or whatever comews from the heart. Trust me she will like whatever you get her.|`|VD694WY1aa	well don't buy expensive jewelry - her parents probably won't like that. The teddy bear or stuffed animal idea is cute - she can hold it and keep it in her room. Flowers are nice - or a journal or cd|`|6mpfxYwmaa	something really thoughtful..maybe a necklace or charm bracelet or a stuffed animal..good luck!|`|leKt5XqSaa	Shes young so anything sentimental will do lika a teddy bear or a dozen roses something that shows your really into her.|`|sMrYGtdmaa	a teddy-bear and a kiss:)|`|e2i7KRnUaa	Something from the heart
1epMphSmaa	A lot of this depends on your age. If you are 19 or 20 and havent "sowed your wild oats" yet....then you are finally figuring out what you are missing out on.<br>  The fact that you crave these feelings and ideas of being single and going out and mingling means that there is something missing from your current relationship. <br>  I honestly dont know how you would go about doing this without hurting your guy. If you truly truly love him.....then stay with him....but if the feelings just arent there like they should be and you are craving new people and new things....then just rip the bandaid off and follow your instinct. Unfortunately, he will be hurt and you will have to carry that with you also.<br>  good luck in whatever you decide.|`|M2xyrBjEaa	I think that you should overall do what's best for you. If you're in a relationship you don't feel a hundred percent committed to, then that's not fair for either of you. Although, if you have something really great with this person, then I don't think you should throw that away either. You just need to figure out if you still like this person like you did, and then go from there.

3lQYvISgaa	i cant believe you text him with a question like that question of that importance should always be asked face to face because the body signals that are sent at that moment is part of the answer if it is from the heart|`|5tmU8cbAaa	I bet what he meant about that is that he'd never actually thought about it. Since you said he'd been going through a hard time, you should probably not bring it up again until things are settled again. But, on the other hand, if he was drinking, you never know. Good luck!|`|nVkMSRY5aa	ok give him time and when a guy says he cant talk about that rite now that better then most guys....i no like 10000 guys that will just say um g2g by and its really gay.. also if he is going through alot rite now just like hang out with him alot and help him (if u can) just like show him how good of a grl friend u can b...and if he does ask u out and u say yes b how u were when u guys weren't going out....|`|Xel3S1W5aa	hmmm, that's a tough one. How well do you know him? Maybe he was just trying to get in your pants and then gave up.<br>  Or maybe he really is a great guy but IS going through some tough stuff. <br>  Whenever drinking is involved in relationships its never good. What he said, he could have not meant if he was drunk.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :]|`|nlPWS7Rgaa	all he needs is a friend he obliviously dosent want to date anyone geez you probably screwed it all up now. he wanted a friend and you ****** it up cause you wanted to date him wtf thats messed up.|`|cggkcAC5aa	Wow, it seems that he doesnt feel like talking to you at the moment<br>  give him time<br>  It would be nice if you could help me with mine too<br>  =]<br>  <a href="http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306171522AAvPXrb">http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|7l12OlHcaa	look he seem to be going through many problems in his life he needs time to assort his feelings and emotions that are troubling his mind.|`|NQ8fKb3Haa	He is probably just confused. You should try talking to him face to face so you can interpret his reactions. Also, if you suspect that he is drunk, wait until he is sober. Also, don't rush into things. If you both have been hurt by people in the past, I'm sure he will understand if you need more time to adjust. Good luck! :)|`|8TDnfCkaaa	Don't push it. It sounds like he's just ending a relationship that he may still have feelings for the other person involved. Thats too much baggage to take on. I would just sit back and let him make the next move.|`|hxQaqSvkaa	He likes u he jus has stuff goin on. Be patient n he might turn out to be a really great guy. Just make sure you don't hurt him.|`|3f04d9ffb6ff4f3a0291d329acc40e45aa	Well he told you that he wants to get to know you a little better, maybe that is why he didn't wanna tell you.
n5tTBNcMaa	Lemme give you some advice, honey.  Don't get his number, give him yours (but only if you have a cellphone, cause landlines are too risky unless you're unlisted).  If he's interested, he'll call and, yeah, this is old-fashioned, but guys like to chase a girl, not the other way around.  If you chase them, then all the mystery and allure of being with you is off the table.  If he doesn't call, oh well, you missed out on a dud - no great loss.  Also, if you decide to accept a guy's number, don't call more than once, it seems a little desperate and don't ask where he is, say, "just calling to say hi, give me a call later."  Then leave it at that.  If he's interested, he'll call you back.  If he doesn't call you back then he's lost interest or he's a player or he's moved on and like I said, that's no great loss.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Maybe they have a tight schedule or the phone number they gave you, is not theirs. They were just playing with you or they are with a girl already. Maybe they just lost interest in you.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	Guys I have found, are not phone people. I am not a phone person either. I prefer face to face contact. It's easier to tell whether they are being truthful or not.|`|AA12157752	Players who aren't interested but needed girl's attention to fill up their selfesteem.|`|ZxCK2vi9aa	Cuz they're jerks... Maybe he has a busy schedule, or just forgets things... try not to hold it against a guy, unless he does it repeatedly...|`|eqPFKpVqaa	Uhhh, maybe he's not interested.|`|QYaWJu8vaa	My guess is that if they never call back it's because they're not interested.

xJCc01oRaa	How are we supposed to know?<br>  <br>  You should know if you love him.<br>  <br>  But it sounds like you don't.
kvmWDuOJaa	Well if he seems to be giving you obviously more attention than the other girls around then there's a good chance that he likes you!<br>  If you want to find out for sure whether he does and perhaps take it a little further, the best move is flirting.<br>  Start off subtly, like:<br>  Moving a little closer to him, smiling a lot, giving him a lot of eye contact, touching his arm when you speak to him, letting him catch you watching him from across the room.<br>  If he seems to be enjoying it or mimicking anything you do then he probably does like you. As time goes by, I'd recommend getting to know him better as a friend, and gradually starting to filrt with him more until he makes a move.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I'm sure it will work out really well for you :)<br>  If I helped, could you please consider sparing a few seconds of your time to vote for my school by clicking the below link?

It was like that for me with some other guy but thats just the way they are.  you guys are like flirty friends. But you don't have to take my word for it. I dont know you or him so just do what ever feels right for you.  Think about it, if you guys went out would it be worth it? would you be happy? would you realize that it was only meant to be a friend relation ship? Pay more attention to what he does it might be that he is interested though.|`|jB2p4fSmaa	Not to intrude on you little chick question or anythin buuuuut, girl if you like him you should definitely know that he toootaly likes you!

(;|`|Voq6D4a1aa	well hopefully your not trying to rush things because telling a girl you love them can be pretty overwhelming.

So good luck and hopefully she says yes.|`|3EjaVKj6aa	well i mean u may shouldn't have said i love you but maybe she likes you or maybe not i mean it depends on the grl. the thing is if she liked u idk wats to think about. idk thats me. i would just get ready for the best or the worst cuz since idk her it's hard to tell.|`|adNnf6Ppaa	dont worry she likes you for sure..<br>  but maybe she just wants to get to know you better before she makes a legitimate answer.<br>  m bestfriend asked me out and it took me almost a month to decide.<br>  turned out great BTW..|`|ylcYx79Baa	You told her you loved her.

He flirts with them and they call you names, if he really cared this would not happen so dump him and move on.  Take my word for it I had the same situation, I told myself he was just being nice, being friendly but no, he was messing around and eventually move onto to my best friend and they both cheated on me for a long time until others just couldn't take it anymore and told me.  I took him back eventually and it turned out he was still seeing her!!!!  Girls get insecure and question themselves but here's the thing to remember, from one old enough to know:<br>  1) If you are uncomfortable and feel something is wrong, guess what you are not crazy you are probably right<br>  2) you deserve to be treated well and if he is doing this and these others feel free to treat you so badly he is not being a good boyfriend<br>  3) no boyfriend is better than a bad one, some girls think they have to have a boyfriend but maybe being tied to this loser is preventing you from noticing other guys who are better. <br>  <br>  move one babe|`|l3zcx5ITaa	maybe you should break up with him since he flirts with other girls but that is just me you should follow your heart if you really like him stay with him|`|T8sM6RRDaa	i have the same problem<br>  dump the guy if it is bothering you or stand up to those guys<br>  feel free to email me. i m also 14|`|WKBVrHhbaa	They're all jealous of you, and they're "hating" thats why you're getting called those names, just ignore them.<br>  <br>  Have a talk with him and tell him that it bothers you that he is so social with the girls.

NlYGbqnkaa	Yes it has happened to you...The best thing to do is sit down with her and explain your feelings. If she tells you she just wants to be friends then you will have to explain to her that you can't be her friend. You have feelings for her and you can't stand by and watch her be with other guys and get close to her as her friend when you feel the way you do. Be prepared to walk away and end the whole thing. The idea here is that once your gone she will miss what you had and maybe see there is more there then what she had thought. If your there doing all of the things a boyfriend does without any of the boyfriend benefits it will never change.|`|Uyz7U8Uraa	it depends u mite have put urself in the friend zone but others may think u were put i the lykeing zone/ when u only give signs to a girl that are friend signs that is putting yourself in it but i dont know how to get out of it

And it will suck a lot  you want to be with your bf /gf whenever u can but when they are so far away you can't the closet thing you can do with them is talk on the phone .|`|E7TkNO00aa	Long distance relationships don't usually last, unless the communication and faithfulness is strong. Have a nice day.|`|5nkcIfKXaa	Been there, done that.  It DON'T work.
MPxd2nDHaa	Let's see: Cheating:<br>  2.  Though I've never heard of this girl before and when I ask about her he says she's a friend he's known since 7th grade. And the entire time we talk about it he stutters.--- Check.<br>  <br>  3.  The talks have recently shortened to around 30 minutes and he seems rather distance. Like he's always making small talk instead of actually carrying a conversation. --- Check<br>  <br>  4. All of it --- Check.<br>  <br>  This guy is a jerk. Get rid of him. I'm sorry.|`|KJAKihaCaa	oiy that's rough. You need to do some deep investigating but the way you wrote it makes it seem pretty bad especially if he has a history of cheating. I mean if your instincts are telling you some thing's up then you've got to trust them.<br>  I would just say investigate without letting him know what you're doing. and if you find something out slowly ask him about it. Don't tell him you know anything until he's done explaining himself. Then pounce on him with everything you KNOW to be fact. He won't have time to come up with a good excuse and you'll get your answer.|`|0ktcvglRaa	He's cheating on you. I read the whole thing, and you totally described my ex-boyfriend. I almost thought it was the same guy, but he's 22 now and is dating a 16-year-old.|`|0M5XYROfaa	wow hun, im really not sure aye but most people would say to trust your instincts, you could try and catch him out maybe? Thats how a friend of mine found out her boyfriend had cheated. <br>  confront him nicely(dont seem like your accusing) and see what his reaction is. If he gets all defensive and angry and tries to turn it around on to you then id say hes guilty! If he just laughs and says nicely no, then hes either very faithful or just a good as lier lol.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|F5eKBBaXaa	Hey it's okay just believe in yourself, and say yes you can loose that extra weight. Hey the fat and unattractive have rights to. I think but we need people to point at and make fun at it makes us all feel better. It's what we into it's simple when you party with me.|`|VUKDrd2taa	He's a cheater cheater pumpkin eater!<br>  <br>  Its kinda of funny thought, my ex did the exact same thing with the myspace, it went from in a relationship to swinger..what theeee ?And he had some lame excuse too. Trust me, boys arent smart enough to hide being a cheater for to long, he will slip up, they arent good with being descreat.Pay attention more to what go's on on his myspace, it sounds childish but thats seriously how i found out EVERYTHING with my ex.|`|0oyiXko0aa	hes cheating on u<br>  <br>  dead give away<br>  <br>  age difference<br>  <br>  dump him|`|Ix4wLPJ5aa	My advice to you is you is rust you have to get so eons I. The inside to see. Someone you trust very well.  I'm sorry if he is but I don't know you personally but it looks like he may be.  One day when your together sit him down and ask him some questions about it.  Go onto YouTube and search: how to detect a lie and watch some videos of it and use those techinuques when your talking to him.|`|PPlLiMuJaa	well, before you jump to conclusions, maybe you should ask the girl he got drunk with. also, if hes not cheating, then hes losing interest. he acts like hes not into you. also, ask yourself do you still love him. you should also try confronting him. tell him that if hes cheating on you, to tell you. swear you wont get mad and if he tells you, you will pretend it never happened and will love him still. he should tell you by then.|`|zoAJBAupaa	I'm an avid reader of books like "He's Just Not that Into You" (amazing by the way), and I just gotta say.<br>  <br>  <br>  This guy is totally not worth it. I've been through this before with my ex of 2 years. He stopped being all cuddly, he cut our phone conversations to less than 15 minutes, changed his status on facebook to "in an open relationship", and would constantly go on weird, secret outings, but constantly say "No no I love you baby".<br>  You know what? That weird reassuring he kept doing made me suspicious. And I was right...he had slept with my friend.<br>  <br>  <br>  If things are starting to become minimal, and you feel paranoid, is that what kind of relationship you want? He's not man enough to tell you himself. I don't know if he's cheating, but he's definitely not that into you.<br>  <br>  Now if this continues for another few weeks, dump his pathetic ***, and get your hot, smoking self out to a club and have the time of your flirtatious life!

4gVgujsXaa	If he has a girlfriend then he is unavaliable. Think about it: He may be saying the same thing to his actual girlfriend. Get it together and find a guy who wants only you
PeJnA85Raa	Most relationships are amazing in the beginning, when everything is new and you are still getting to know each other. Often times when people get more "comfortable" in the relationship things start to change, and other personality traits begin to come out. I would advise you talk to him about it, and if he is not interested in treating you better, than I would consider ending it. If you really think he is not treating you right it's better to get out sooner rather than later, because you will go through more pain each time he hurts you. I hope things work out, good luck!|`|uA0MGxyHaa	Well if I were you I would sit down and talk to him. <br>  Tell him how you are feeling and how you feel the relationship has been going latley.<br>  Maybe he will understand and you will work things out, you never know. <br>  Just like us girls, guys cant read minds either, he may not have even noticed a difference in the relationship. You should let him know that you dont like the way he has been treating you. <br>  <br>  <br>  Well hope I helped. Best of luck :))|`|Qtha4ZjHaa	u know this sounds just like my last relationship exactly. What i did was make it funnier to be around me, hang out a little less but not to much less or it will end in a flash, i came up with new ideas of where to go and hang out and when ever we got into fights i gave her a little time off to calm down.|`|7CAUiE0taa	It's not always the man job to spice up the relationship get that straight. Women also have to take care of their man, I suggest you got out and buy yourself some sexy lingerie and wear it one special night and make him drool his *** off!!! Making him know that you still got it.|`|WQ4hXvzmaa	Have a heart to heart with him.  Tell him how your feeling.  If you both love each other you should be able to work it out and get the relationship back on track.|`|sSTXLQEUaa	or it could be he lost interest in you. Some cowards, males particularly, would rather make you break up with him than fess up and break up with you.|`|uqwL9544aa	It's because your entire life has been meaningless, and your using this relationship like a emotional clutch.
0ktcvglRaa	Don't go back with your ex. Just don't do it. They're ex's for a reason.|`|euQFQzc5aa	When you say still treated you like a girlfriend do you really mean he was still having sex with you?<br>  <br>  He probably realized he was about to get sucked back into the relationship so now he's treating you like **** so that you disappear.<br>  <br>  Sorry lady.|`|AA11263103	Best Answer - Chosen by Asker<br>  1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|XYBCQz8Naa	reason guys become jerks are because they're hurt more than the other person and try to make themself feel better by bashing the other person or just acting like a jerk. if hes being a jerk, then hes a waste of your time, forget him. there are other guys out there.|`|AA12022610	sound like he could be seeing someone else and doesn't want to tell you but i would ask him how he feels to be sure.|`|1FEa56xCaa	Oh tough one....<br>  I'm not sure what to say..keep your chin up though!|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Time could be better spent on self enlightenment and enrichment.  There is a selfish element of egotism that attempts ownership or  possession of a romantic partner.  This is immature and naive.  <br>  <br>  The only person who can really be owned is self.  Rely on self to enhance how you feel about anything.  Achievement and accomplishment towards career and educational success will build personal and professional confidence.<br>  <br>  Focus on what can be done independently without the definition or validation of a male romantic partner.  This is your opportunity to mature socially.<br>  <br>  Discover how reliable auto erotic exploration can fulfill sensual expectation.  Learn to function without male interaction.  This will improve articulation of quality time when you decide the appropriate circumstance for social interaction.  It must become your decision to control romantic intimacy.<br>  <br>  You must learn to be comfortable with or without male companionship.|`|AJ1vAIBvaa	give up he has moved on you just dont know it because he found somebody else broke up with you but still wants you because of what you and him had but now he has somebody else and does not want to break up with them and make them sad just to be back with you|`|JfsN4FSraa	he probably does like you just to boyish (retarded) to admit it|`|2Zoq6Lj5aa	theres alot better guys out there. u dont need to go through that.|`|uqwL9544aa	Give up|`|o2mKm6zVaa	give up .. <br>  if they ignore you for that long its kaapeesh.|`|jdJ74Hjaaa	move on forget that loser|`|6pp9O7iWaa	we've alllll been there girl . he really does care about you. keep your head up.. he'll come aound|`|nstpvfluaa	I really think that he's just trying to show that he's the guy that broke up with you and that he's the one who's the man. He really just wants to look tough and show that he's over you. After a month of so I think that he will stop talking bout you behind your back. I can tell that he still likes you and he will stop once he recognizes that you are over him! <br>  <br>  Good luck and Hope all goes well with your relationship with your friend!|`|ep7Yss6maa	I think you should have one last crack at him, maybe take him out to some place nice and ask him if he still likes you.

Maybe dinner after? If the "date" goes well then you can ask her if she wants to get something. Plus this way you'll have something to talk about if it's awkward.

Just move on or find someone else.
0ktcvglRaa	Wow, some best friend! You have a right to be mad at her and not be friends with her anymore. Don't even fake a smile; she doesn't deserve that!

Just act like she's a total stranger. don't ignore her-- just act as if she's just another person.<br>  <br>  That'll hurt her more.|`|xwDzek6uaa	I guess you have to ask yourself whether you still want to be friends.<br>  <br>  If you do, then you are going to have to talk about it.

I would tell her how you feel. Talking always helps and you should be mad at both your ex and your friend. He must've been a jerk to break up with you that way! NO ONE can EVER break up with anybody through and indirect form of communication. He didn't even have the guts to tell you to your face that he didn't like you....what a jerk. Plus, if your friend was truly your friend she would've talked to you about going out with him before she actually did, but she didn't. That's not the best sign of a good friendship. Anyways I'm being completely harsh, I would just talk to your friend and maybe your ex. Get things out in the open and show your true colors. Best wishes!|`|NmRE6VTfaa	WoW! That's one sticky situation there! Ok, you should tell your friend how you feel, rehearse what you're going to say before you say it. Tell her that you don't appreciate her doing this to you and encouraging this bad behavior from your dumb "x" boy friend. <br>  <br>  If I were you I would drop your friend unless she is willing to say sorry for what she did.

XxqUBcozaa	heres an option<br>  <br>  rather then waiting for him to say something or make another movie, why dont you bring it up in a convo. remember he did take the big step to tell you he loved you at the wedding. so in a way the ball is now in your court, i think its up to you to make the next move<br>  <br>  good luck!

YMgm99gdaa	Take a handful of Aleve...problem solved.|`|c07v7O80aa	No. It's not unbearable. It's not a tenth of the pain regular ole folks bear up under in far worse situations than yours. It feel bad because you assumed, quite naturally, that if you loved someone it would just all work out. That's not the way things always work. And this is one way you find out how to find out whether or not things will work between people. Time will take care of the hurt. If you think hard about the experience, you'll be better prepared to (1) make better guesses and (2) work better on relationships because you'll know assuming and hoping isn't what does it.|`|qXkTatLMaa	It seems as if you have reached a crossroads.  You can either talk to him, and the two of you can make a plan about being together and making it, or you can try to let him go, get over him, and make the most of your current situation.  The only thing about that is that the first option involves another person. And, no matter how hard you try, the only person that you really know exactly what they are going to do is yourself.  Seems like it is time for some major soul searching and evaluation of your lifestyle and desires.  If you want to move on with him, talk to him about you two building a life together, and see if he is willing to follow through with it.  Question:  do you believe that you are a better person without him?  If so, continue to love him and wish him well, but make the most of yourself, and your life in your current situation.  I wish you the best.|`|kTUL01tfaa	you must have fell hard for him. find comfort in the bible, psalms and proverbs, new testament, not clubs.|`|Vh3TGfdEaa	play some gears of war 2 <br>  <br>  get into some recreational activities <br>  <br>  find a better man|`|3ioUdPuZaa	I know it seems like a year and a half is forever when you are young. But in the GRAND SCHEME of life, it isn't. <br>  You didn't say WHY your friends think you are a better person without this guy, but you DID elude to the same thought yourself. Whatever the "trouble" was that caused you to be "not the same good person" with him as you are without him, is VERY IMPORTANT. <br>  But I don't have to know what it is, only YOU DO. But it IS important. It's important because you couldn't make it with "it" between you. Face the main reason you are apart...it wasn't JUST being able to make it financially. <br>  Fact is you can change yourself, but NO ONE CAN CHANGE SOMEONE ELSE. So your choices are (unless he is gone bye-bye and wants to end it) to either find a WAY to live with it, IF YOU CAN. Or stay away from him and OUT OF GOD'S way so that HE can decide on his own when he wants to change his "bad habits."<br>  IT DOES take TWO! One cannot love enough on their own!<br>  Your must stick close to what YOU KNOW is right and good and do not let yourself deny the problems or overlook them. You aren't loving him the RIGHT way, if you do!<br>  He must learn and perhaps, so must you. Time will tell. And that might be the hard part. Time may be 15 years or Never, we have no way of knowing.<br>  But bad cannot change to good without someone TRYING to make it change. <br>  As for the hurt, you hurt because you are a caring and loving and trusting human being who someone has "dumped" on. The shame isn't for you, it is for him. <br>  The hurt can be managed with daily or even hourly prayer...feel the pain and cry if you must, have your sorrow, but then get up and live each and every day ONE DAY AT A TIME...that's all, just one day at a time think to yourself, WHAT will I do this day to get through it. Then do it! Every day will be a little bit better. There are lots of people due to divorce,death or any number of horrible circumstances that HAVE to learn to move through the pain one day at a time. YOU CAN DO IT.

Don't let the stars dictate your life.|`|fJFPbyqTaa	First of all astrology is real, but magazine/newspaper horoscopes aren't. scorpios are usually very sexual, but also very intense.

I had chances too but I really want to just meet a great guy who understands that its just more than a physical act its an emotional one too and its just really meaningful and special. I agree with the whole rap sheet thing. I think im okay im not a weirdo or anything either. Yeah even guys are turned off to girls who aren't experienced..or just like to be the first one to have sex with that girl first. Its more than just a physical act and it really means a lot in a relationship ...i mean you are completely opening yourself up to someone. <br>  <br>  I cant understand why any girl wouldn't want to date you- you seem pretty awesome to me.<br>  <br>  Where are all the guys like you hiding? lol|`|nctI8wmBaa	DUUUUUDE!<br>  you're so cool dang<br>  OF COURSE IT'S OKAYYY.<br>  i'm 14 and saving mine until marriage.<br>  wow. i thought there would be no more guys like you anymore, haha<br>  be an inspiration to others (;|`|Kx3I4RC7aa	Yes, I am 18 going to be 19 soon.|`|Rj7L1Rc6aa	yeah its ok. im 18 and still 1. but i never really had the chance|`|fb101442e93f61cc6d8149465ab7e585aa	Yes it is okay to be a virgin at your age! Some girls will actually think that is very cool and will be more interested in you since they know you are all about building up a "rap sheet" as you call it. Its awesome that you want to wait and find the right person to share that 1st experience with because it is a special thing.

It's alot better than them finding out through someone else. Talk to them, since you have a good relationship with them and tell them that you've made a big mistake that you feel terrible about. Stealing, no matter how much the item cost, is not good as you know. Explain to them that you don't even know what you were thinking because you loved your job & you are very embarrassed & disappointed in yourself. I'm sure they will forgive you and you will feel better about it too.

M5VAv0jMaa	There is nothing wrong with being a transsexual. It is a part of who you are and nothing to be ashamed of. You are also not alone as there are many many people who are going through the same issues as you. As for what other people will think, it will just depend on the individuals. Many people will probably be jerks about it and that will obviously by very hard to deal with. Hopefully you will eventually be able to surround yourself with people who will accept who you are, but be prepared for a rocky road. It sounds like you have a good relationship with your parents, so you should tell them. Be patient with them after you tell them, they may not accept it right away. But if they have always loved and supported you, chances are good they will come around. I'm listing in the sources a transsexual support site specifically geared towards helping young people such as yourself get through the issues you are dealing with. I hope this helps and wish you the very best in life!|`|TZMBn5z7aa	there will always be people who dislike you no matter what you do  thats just life <br>  as for being a transexual well if you are 100% sure that is what you want then I wish you luck  if you think you can tell your parents then do so if you are not sure then maybe wait until you can live on your own  so that you are taking care of you and don't need to worry what they think <br>  <br>  but if you ask me I think that as long as you don't harm others  you should be able to be who ever you are   so if being a woman would make you happy  well then go for it <br>  <br>  good luck|`|xutAEx7Faa	theres noting WRONG with it, alot people will just find it werid. but if it truly makes you happy and thats what you want, go for it. dont try to live a lie because theres nothing worse then that. and dont listen to people like " YOULL BURN IN HELL" burn in hell? for what? wanting to be the other sex? lol see how stupid that sounds? good luck.|`|A91tV4P5aa	i dont think it is--go for it before its too late|`|KnTrvQd6aa	Being transsexual is not a choice, so it can't be "bad" or "wrong"; it simply IS.<br>  <br>  Transsexualsim is a congenital condition;you're either BORN transsexual, or you're NOT transsexual. <br>  If anyone insists  that it's "bad", "wrong" or "sinful" to be transsexual, they must also consider it "bad", "wrong" or "sinful" to be born with a cleft palate, a clubfoot, many heart conditons, or any one of the thousands of congenital medical conditions that exist. There's no in-between; if ANY congenital condition is "wrong", ALL congenital conditions must be.<br>  <br>  If you think you might be transsexual, it's a good idea to tell your parents, and also your GP/family doctor; you will need medical input at some point, and your doctor is the first port of call for that.<br>  <br>  Here's a link to a website dedicated to suporting young transpeople; you might find it helpful;<br>  <a href="http://www.antijen.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.antijen.org/</a><br>  <br>  And, you say you're good at art, languages & maths; that's not surprising. One of the few compensations for being born transsexual is that it does give you a higher IQ (around 20-30% higher, usually).  We may have been dealt a poor hand in life generally, but at least we're smart ;)<br>  <br>  Good luck on your path, wherever it takes you.|`|BtxQogSzaa	theres nothing wrong with it! however you are  only 17, i'd advise you to wait until you are about 20...if you still feel the same then go for it.<br>  you do need to tell your parents how your feeling tho, its best to get them knowing about this befpre it happens, plus it wont be such a shock when/if it happens.<br>  <br>  you also have to have an open mind towards others, im afraid there will always be ignorent people in the world who will say its 'wrong'...but think about it...is being happy and being the way YOU want to be wrong? of course not. just keep an open mind about these people.<br>  <br>  good luck tho :)
A5W8LQzVaa	I remember the song liner, "Some good things never lasts". That's how you can call your friendship. You've probably been so good to her and took advantage to your goodness. You have to end your "goodness" towards her or you'll have a "bitter" tomorrow. SSN and Birth Certificate are very personal matters. They can neither be borrowed nor transferable. If you do, she may make use for illegal transactions. For if it wasn't for illegal use,  why can't she make use of hers? You're on the right tract lady. She must understand that being her friend you also, have a future needs wherein those important items are still most important than your friendship. Duplicated personalities is one of the common problem now faced by National Statistics Offices.|`|j1yLZ7ozaa	It's YOUR ssn and YOUR birth certificate. If she didn't think it was a bad idea that could get the person they belonged to in trouble, she would have used her own. She's mad because you aren't giving her what she wants. She sounds spoiled or stupid to me. You didn't overreact, she overreacted. <br>  <br>  She sounds like someone who's just going to get you in trouble anyways, but that's your call.|`|GW1PzzdSaa	Bad friend! Stay away from her! Good friends will not let you into trouble. Only bad friends do. (",)|`|4VIjILk1aa	No you did not over react. She's not a true friend and I don't think she has any right to be mad at you.|`|6vgTVPtEaa	she is bad and mean too|`|ky4Sobzkaa	No... You did just what I would do!  I would understand if she just asked for your license, but your SSN and birth certificate?  That's way too much.  Plus, you didn't have to prove anything to her by letting her use them.  Friends shouldn't have to prove anything to their REAL friends.  If you think you're being used by people around you, then those people are not even worth it.  Find new friends if anything.  There's plenty of them out there, especially good ones that won't try to use you for their benefits.|`|RvKDQlROaa	well if thats the way you felt then thats what you gotta do right, maybe she wasnt a good friend and she was taking advantage of you...so your better off without her friendship anywas, theres plenty more people to meet out there anyways...|`|8IfePMa3aa	Definitely never speak with her again! She's not only a bad friend, she's a wanna-be felon. <br>  What she's trying to do is identity theft. Never, ever let anyone have that information. Allowing this information in the wrong hands will ruin the rest of your life.
IzztdPIfaa	You may want to spice things up ... <br>  <br>  I was in the same situation as you. I was considering divorce. Then a friend of mine recommended this ebook. It is g-r-e-a-t.

Making Love, when you love your partner, is the most wonderful thing on earth.<br>  <br>  I wish you and your wife the best,|`|y21VcTjDaa	If she sees sex as a "chore" I'd bet it's because you aren't very good at it or you simply are not satisfying her.  If it was good for her, she'd want to do it more..that's just common sense.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	Sex is a chore for me too and I dread it, and want it over and done with as quickly as possible.  In spite of my telling him so, he's too rough and often hurts me physically, and he tries to coerce me into doing things that I don't feel comfortable doing, and then blames me by saying 'you give up too quickly'.<br>  <br>  The point of my telling you is, sex for a woman is an emotional thing, and for men it's more physical.  Does she feel loved, cared about?  How is your communication in general?  Are you selfish in bed, and use her body for pleasure without giving her a second though?  Questions like that you need to ask yourself and be honest with yourself about.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you will find a resolution soon.<br>  <br>  In kindness|`|AA11391968	Try getting her in the mood by being more loving.

You need to talk to your woman. In how to get that spark back.|`|XuoT57Idaa	Women need to feel love to want sex (talking long term relationship) and men need sex to feel loved. <br>  Here are my thoughts:<br>  <br>  1. You sound like a sex addict, like this is an obsession maybe? Talk to your doctor about normal parameters. <br>  <br>  2. Do you know what the word foreplay means? Read a book on foreplay ideas. Sometimes my hubby and I have quick sex, but mostly it lasts 45+ minutes. Buy a silver bullet vibrator for your wife and remember, you aren't done until she is done:)<br>  <br>  3. Help her with housework, touch her without it leading to sex like hugs kisses pats during the day. All these things show that you love her (read first line)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uLHtXibRaa	To be honest i think that you maybe you  have had a tendency toward sex addiction in the past.. but now yuor wife has lost interest in sex it seems to have brought out that tendency to the point were it is a serious issue..its very natural for you to feel like this if your wife is not showing you the sexual attention that you need, men do need to be cared for by their woman ..but a woman needs to feel loved to want to have sex and men need sex to express and feel loved......i would say if you are worried about if you are an addict  theres an organisation called..S.A.A ((SEX ADDICTS ANONYMOUS)..if you look up S.A.A.org...on the net..you will find a page were you can take a quick test and that will give you a good idea of your rating to see if you are classed as an addict.. it then also advises were to seek support...if your wife isnt listening to you then this really is the root i think of your problem...and she really needs to support you with your concern..but perhaps to you need to find out why she finds sex with her husband such a chore?|`|JjoLo4e1aa	sex addiction is serious and real, if you dont address it ( WITH YOUR WIFE ) you wont be married much longer, trust me<br>  <br>  you can try to get her to take female viagra, as this increases her labido or you can ask her if you can get sex from elsewhere LOL but dont hold your breath|`|tEy9hvebaa	make lovemaking with your wife NOT a chore for her! <br>  <br>  your new motto should be "ladies come first, and often" if you take that approach with your wife SHE'LL view lovemaking as a pleasure not a chore.<br>  <br>  I find I almost never masturbate... however I have a GREAT sex life with my wife... because I focus on HER pleasure... mine is strictly secondary... but because SHE enjoys our lovemaking -I- get plenty.|`|TzbFaj8caa	Your not a sex addict unless you are lusting for other women and not your wife.

That could be a HUGE factor.  And age might be a factor as well. Men are in their "prime" in their late teens and throughout their twenties, and women have higher libido in their late 30's and mid 40's. <br>  <br>  Also factor in what she does on a daily basis. Does she have a job that requires a lot physically or mentally? Maybe she's just tired. And, I have to say, if you want it 7 times a day every day, I would view it as a chore too!! Maybe you should get a hobby? lol I don't know|`|dFUqPcWKaa	Chances are, if you're masturbating so much, she knows about it. Which is probably the reason why you're feeling like you're not getting enough in the bedroom.. Women need to feel desired. If you're jacking off so many times a day, without need of her, what message does that send her? That she's not needed.<br>  <br>  Try talking to your wife. Perhaps she feels like you have a problem, too, but she isn't sure how to approach you about it because she's afraid to offend you. But don't let *ALL* of the focus be on you, of course.. she's the one who isn't putting out, so find out why!|`|9QKu9ynxaa	women enjoy sex just as much as men. some even more so. if your wife views sex as a chore, perhaps its because u R a sex addict, and u r selfish in bed. only getting yours, but not getting her off.

I think if it gets in the way of everyday living it does become a problem but only you can be the judge of that!  Would you say that you take care of her needs?  Not just when it comes to sex but in the areas that she feels are important to her?  If someone feels that they're not getting what they need they may not have the energy to give back in return, or she may not be into having sex as often as you do and then you have to decide how or if you can live with that!|`|fswPWFswaa	maybe think about the things that make her happy. sex should never be used to "fulfill a need" it's used to show another that you love them and used to explore and be intimate with that person. so maybe show her the more emotional side of it. be romantic wit her. surprise her by doing a chore that she'd normally have to ask you to do send her flowers at work, take her out to a fancy dinner, maybe play the song ya'll danced to at ya'lls wedding one night after dinner and dance with her....so many ways to get a woman in the mood. just have to be creative and think of what makes her tick. good luck!|`|nw9dKElSaa	Being an addict is a very relative word.<br>  basically you have a fire burning and that is good (natural) but like a furnace, if contained provides heat light and so on, but if the fire is out of control it will bring pain and destruction.<br>  You being a man are the leader. your wife is looking for leadership. If you are masturbating that much it indicated you have issued with real woman and are seeking the orgasmic feeling rather than the relationship your wife is seeking.<br>  Woman generally heat up slowly, where as men are visually stimulated.women are all about relationship.  When God made man He gave man a job. When God made woman, He gave her a relationship. You are chasing the orgasm. Your wife wants you to chase her.

He's stuck in a high security prison, for a crime punishable by death.  Death row has hung itself over his head for the past nine years, and he's not about to wait around for his final day so early in his life, due to another's decision.<br>  By a chance of fate, he notices a flaw in this prison.  They don't count the blades in the razors when they are returned.  Week after week, he slowly begins to collect a multitude of blades.  One night, he puts together a small knife, using the melted end of his toothbrush, and the blades.  During the next day's recreation time, the prisoner plants the homemade knife on a bench close to the most violent gang in the prison.  As his plan begins to unfold, his chance of escaping brings a deeper feeling of terror to the prisoner.  <br>  The gang predictably uses the newly found instrument, and the entire area goes under lock-down.   The prisoner begins to walk toward the entrance of the prison.  The guards in the tower aim their guns and shoot.  <br>  In the prisoner's cell, they find a note telling of the prisoner's plan to commit suicide.  <br>  <br>  It's a little weird, I know, but I just made it up, so I hope it helped!|`|PukiDJANaa	you could write about a day in your life. and overly describe what your meals were, the visual descriptions of your friends/family...|`|Pfr7wTuzaa	maybe write about how something goes soo bad then at the very end it just changes drastically.|`|50XVZNSIaa	maybe a fantisy story with that you can keep going and going

PPDFSAY6aa	Girls like to play games, we know, we have all done it at one point or the other.  So first, think about what it is that you really want to do.  Is she calling you when she needs a favor, like the paper writing or you doing the paying for the outings and lunches? Second, if you don't mind doing those things and you do really like her, just take a leap of faith and plunge right in with the question.."So i'm really into you and i just was wondering how you felt about me?"  Couldn't hurt, in the end you will have your answer and that is what you are seeking anyway! Good luck|`|SRZza0cWaa	wow.. no be man nd call her.. shes probably waiting for ur call...good luck...xx|`|98e3c7186b7b33e48db9abb40896c0efaa	After her "busy weekend", wait a few days.

azE51WGRaa	Unfortunately with drug users, you can't make them change their habits or quit the drugs unless they want to do it. All you can do is change YOUR life for the best of you and the baby. I would honestly leave him. I know this is hard to consider, especially being pregnant, but it would probably be for the best. What if the cops were to bust him for drugs at your house? You could be charged as an accessory because you knew about it. Then your baby could be off to foster care because HE did something wrong, not you. Also, what would be better: A child to grow up with a loving, sober mother who takes care of him or a child to grow up walking in from school to find daddy cracked out of his mind masturbating on the couch again? There are so many resources that can help you out if you do decide to leave him. My honest opinion is that it would be better for you to leave him and struggle a little bit now that to stay and struggle the rest of your life. Good luck and I will pray for you...|`|KtDUx4Cuaa	I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but there is nothing you can say or edo to get through to him. He has to get himself off it. Obviously, he doesn't want to be off it.<br>  I know from experience, no matter how hard you try to fight his demons, you will end up tired and exhausted and he will continue his pattern.<br>  My Ex husband became very abusive when he was coming down, I even lost a child form him physically abusing me, you would think that this would make him wake up, but it didn't, he continued down his destructive path and I continued trying to fight his demons. It all ended badly of course and I walked away, he is still on drugs and will be for the rest of his life.|`|Kec5I1Olaa	If you really love him- u cant give up on him- I didn't on mine- I stuck it out and still am- Meth is different though from my situation- See if hell consider rehab or help- my baby never wanted that stuff so i put up with it-  see if his parents might intervene- bcuz the stress really isnt good for you-i was pregnant and i was going through a hard time to with mine.|`|W1ETXgEHaa	Wow welcome to my world! Except I'm 6 mo. pregnant with a 3 yr. old. <br>  So I haven't walked in on him but I might as well have. I wish I had the answer but it's hard when like me you have nowhere to go. I feel as though I've have done this too long from the begining (sp? 2 tired) as I am sure I have. It's a process from the start of the lies. They never seem to end. All I know is that virtually everyday I know in the back of my mind this can't be right...This isn't my life. I want to be happy and my daughter too, and the fact is no matter how hard I'm trying this is NOT working. And I have a good feeling the goes for you. You, like me have misery every minute of everyday. If you don't have depression yet know that it will catch up soon. If you can go...run as fast as you can!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	Do NOT stay with this man. I repeat: do NOT stay with this man. You will only hurt yourself more, and worst of all, your baby. <br>  <br>  I stayed with my bf/so bc i was pregannt with our baby. he fought with em while pregnant, argued with me, and yet i stayed bc I beleived it would be "unfair" to leave him when i was having his baby, and plus I thought he'd change once she came.<br>  <br>  well he didnt. He has improved, but it's not where it needs to be. He abrely helps me with the baby, now 8 mons. He is still difficult tog et along with. I actually made an appointment to move out to my parents' april 3rd, but i don't know, knowing me i will probably cancel and change my mind at the last minute.<br>  <br>  I sometimes think I would've just been better off if I had moved out while pregnant, before the baby was here, now she has seen us fight and his temper with me, and it has scared her. probably and hopefully not traumatized her, but i realize some men never change. <br>  <br>  I think you should give up on him for now at least. I know that isn't the answer you're looking for, but I think it's what you should do. So many women (myself included) make the mistake of staying with the guy while pregnant bc she thinks and hopes the baby will change things once the baby is born, that he will suddenly "wake up" and come around, and all of the sudden be this loving dad and husband. It doesn't work that way. Change is work. And he has to WANT  to change. And addicts esp. have to want that, and unfortunately many don't want it enough. As long as he is on drugs, he will not change or be better. He will not put you or the baby first, only himself and his sick habit.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	You shouldn't be worried about him watching porn..(because first of all he couldn't ever have sex with them.)The real and serious problem is getting him help or checking him into rehab, using meth is dangerous..do you want this around your baby? i'm sure you don't.You need to either leave him or get him help..child services can take your baby away because of this.So do something now before the baby gets here.You or your unborn child don't deserve this.|`|i6Ix28IPaa	Meth users typically are in denial of the damage they are causing to themselves and the ones they love.  Trying to reason with them is pointless; they'll just turn to more meth in order to get through or forget the pain.  <br>  <br>  Your husband needs professional help, and you certainly don't need to raise a child in that environment.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I'd love him from a distance.|`|M5tqVX8Baa	Sweety if I were you I would get a divorce I know it is not easy but you cannot have your grow up with a father like that. You need to take care or yourself and the baby. Screw him. He doesn't deserve such a sweet woman as your self he is cocky and cares only about himself. So you need to do yourself a favor and get out of this marriage. It will be hard and it most definitely won't be easy but honestly you cannot raise your child with a man like this. Do not think you can change him bc you cannot. He will always be like this. You must be strong!!!|`|8K3IucU3aa	say you'll leave him because you're doing all the work that he should be doing and on top of that he's putting you, him, and your child in danger. he needs to grow up and you need to send him to rehab.|`|7810472dea4ef476f08e138148939625aa	dump him! duh...dont be a dummy! you can raise the kid on your own.

(so that's a NO for dating sites, totally eww, and scary). meeting someone off the net just needs a better mental and emotional connection than the kind of chemistry you get in person, plus a LOT more trust on both sides. but of course there's always the possibility of a different chemistry when you do meet the person (unbearably annoying habits, anyone?), but that's a very tiny possibility.|`|e4f8366fe266703c62e64f8a80780278aa	awful is a compliment!<br>  he is totally desperate to get some,even phoned me a few hours before to ask me if we were going to do it after the date was over,what kind of idiot does that?well...most guys online<br>  if you are girl,online is not the best way to meet people,guys are usually very desperate,oh not to mention that they lie about their age|`|xdXz86gkaa	I first spoke to my current boyfriend on the internet (a mutual friend gave him my email address) for about 1 month or so before we met face to face.

I would f the crap out of that girl but never a relationship. OR 2. This girl is pretty, trustwothy and looks like i could marry her and have babies. Now guys look at all girls differently. Its really hard for a girl i guess to determine whether she looks like a hot slut or a beutifull lady. But my advice and answer for this question is: If you are looking for a long and maybe marriage type of relationship be classy, respectable, hard to get and never ever lead or talk about anything sexual or derogotory towards women. Once a man gets any hint that your a freak in bed or in general there goes yoru respectability.|`|IZoLY8akaa	I love it when girls are confident and outgoing.<br>  also if shes a shy good girl but has a sexy/kinky side =)<br>  in order for me to really like her she has to be smart and<br>  can laugh with me...<br>  <br>  as far as looks go, good body and smile and im hooked|`|7uTFVEyDaa	It really depends on the guy.

Even though brittany is ok with it, haley may be uncomfortable with this idea so you shouldnt suprise her with it.  Haley could get mad at both of you and you shouldnt make the fight worse then it is.

All they have to do is go to their local family court.  The court clerk can either give them a package of paperwork that needs to be filed, or tell them where to purchase the package.  Once they've completed the required forms, they would pay court fees (required regardless of how, or by whom, the paperwork is filed).  A court date will be set.  When they show up, all they have to say is that they agree.  The court then draws up an order and files it.  Done deal.  Total cost... probably a couple hundred dollars, and a few hours of paperwork.|`|GmF4iAFXaa	Don't let them divorce!

2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	Believe me, I know where you're coming from- my fiance didn't pop the question until 5 and a half years into our relationship, when it seemed like everyone else in the world but me was getting married!  The good news, though, is that once it happens to you, all the other friends and acquaintances you have who are currently engaged will already be married- thus, you won't have to share the "bride thunder" with anyone else.  Also, since you mention that you're in college, I'm a little shocked that all the girls you know are already engaged.  I don't care how Christian they are- college-age still seems a little young to be making lifelong commitments, in my opinion.  I think your boyfriend is 100% right to wait until after graduation to even start thinking about marriage.  You both need time after college to really settle into the role of young adults out on your own before you take such a big step.  Besides, you're both still so young- what's the rush?  Just remember, after the glamour and attention of the wedding wear off, you'll be married, so make sure you're truly prepared for all that marriage entails and don't rush into a hasty decision just because you want to wear the big dress and have the big party like your friends are doing.|`|7qloglmjaa	don't be!!!!!!!your time will come and just think .you will have it all to yourself.|`|6ndM8fNLaa	Out of curiosity, do you go to BYU? Second of all, do you love your boyfriend regardless of what's going on with the world and outsiders? Or are you feeling pressure to get married because your friends are getting married?<br>  <br>  My husband and I got married before we graduated from college. In fact, he and I will not be graduating until this year and we have been married for 2 and a half years. I can relate to you because my parents did not want us to get married while we were in college, but we did it anyways because we knew we were the right ones for each other. Sometimes you have to follow your heart regardless of what other people say. I had so many people who looked down upon me for getting married, but you know what? We are so happy and I would never go back and change it if I could.<br>  <br>  As far as being jealous goes, just get involved with other things in life that do not keep your mind on that. You could try to be genuinely happy for your friends' engagements by simply helping out with the wedding plans. Making wedding plans can be sooooo much fun! You just may have fun along the way and realize how you would do things differently or the same with your future wedding plans.|`|AA11380378	I know what you mean. It is normal to feel this way. I think it happens to all of us. <br>  <br>  When I was dating my now husband, everyone we knew was getting engaged and getting marries. My husband was a GM for 8 weddings in a row! It was burning me alive, not to count, the costant question, when is it going to be your turn? any ring yert? etc. I was really annoying. I did not push or say anything and tried my best not to snap.<br>  <br>  It paid off, after 2 and 1/2 years of dating, he proposed. Now we are married and laught about it now.<br>  <br>  Goo dluck|`|xuiSfzgraa	I agree with the previous poster.  Help your friend with her wedding. Not only will it keep you occupied, it will give you ideas of what to do/what not to do when you do finally get engaged!  And with all of the other girls you know who are engaged, think of all of the ideas that you will get!  And give your boyfriend time.  If you both want to wait until you graduate before getting married, there is no reason to rush into an engagement just because everyone else is!|`|cLrY0O4Uaa	STORY OF MY LIFE! Haha, My boyfriend and I have been together for over three years, with no sign of engagement for at least another year and a half. His sister and brother just got engaged after a 3 year and a year and a half courtship, respectively. I am feeling antsy too, don't worry! <br>  <br>  I guess talk to him about what his plans are, but don't bug him, because then he'll just feel badgered.<br>  <br>  Oh, boys.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	I have gone through what you are going through. It is so tough not to be jealous. If you feel like you are ready to spend the rest of your life with your boyfriend, then I would sit down and ask him what his future plans are: if he wants to marry you, how long he wants to wait, etc.|`|3o7ULYoLaa	AMEN<br>  I hear you.<br>  I think its just at that age.<br>  I am the same. <br>  I just have to deal with thinking about it.<br>  Help your friend plan the wedding that way you will concentrate on hers and not your own!|`|AIrPtuDUaa	I totally understand where you're coming from.  I too cant wait to get engaged and marry my bofriend.  I often feel like everyone I know is getting married. I'm always going to someone else's wedding and I'm like...when will it ever happen to me??? I throw hints to my boyfriend and we talk about it a lot but at times I get really frustrated.  I just try to realize that he loves me and it will happen soon.  So you shouldnt rush it. It will happen and when it does, you'll spend the rest of your lives together happy. Just keep in mind that he loves you.|`|HcboXOmjaa	I feel like that too, it seems like every week, someone I know has gotten engaged. My bf says we will be engaged in less than 9 months and I believe him, but every time someone I know gets engaged I want it that much more.  I just try and be happy and excited for them and just remember that it hasn't happened to me yet for a reason and you don't want to rush your boyfriend into anything, or else it may not end well.  You are still young and have plenty of time in your life so what's the rush? At least you are with him.  I have heard a lot of people say getting engaged doesn't really feel different than just dating so just enjoy your time together and hopefully it will happen to you soon!|`|XPJgIvOgaa	I know exactly how you feel.<br>  I'm a little bit jealous of some of my friends too.<br>  My boyfriend and I have only been dating for about a year and 4 months but I've known him since 7th grade.<br>  I'm a freshman in college and I've loved him since I met him.<br>  I know that he wants to be engaged just as badly as I do yet he hasn't popped the question yet.<br>  He hints at it a little and so do I but nothing has happened so far.<br>  I understand his reasoning but at the same time I think it's dumb.<br>  He wants to wait until we graduate as well.<br>  And so do I.<br>  I just don't see why we can't be engaged while we're in college.<br>  Do we really have to wait to be engaged until we're done?<br>  It's a little ridiculous to me.<br>  I'm just glad to know that there are other girls out there who feel the same way as I do.<br>  I know I haven't been much help but I really need advice too.<br>  I hope everything works out in the end.<br>  If you want to talk more just send me an e-mail.<br>  I'm always ready to talk and have open ears. :)|`|0jUGSaZPaa	It's hard to be happy for people who are sporting out the ring, when you are not, huh?    :(  I know how you are feeling... Especially when you KNOW he is everything you have been looking for...<br>  <br>  One reason you are getting more antsy, is simply because the whole "engagement" is surrounding you...  So, you can't help but listen to your roommate's plans and think "Oh I would do this" or think how you are the bride opposed to her.  :)  <br>  <br>  It's hard not to fill with jealousy...  So, here's some suggestions that you can try:<br>  <br>  1)  You can ASK your boyfriend (only once, if possible) where he sees you guys, IF you haven't already talked about marriage... To see if he is on the same page as you.<br>  <br>  2)  Understanding that she is your roommate, TRY to distance yourself from her, or just ask her politely to try not mentioning her wedding so much...  **This may offend her, b/c this is an exciting time for her, so you have to explain to her why you are asking her to tone down her "joy"<br>  <br>  3)  Daydream about your own wedding...  Who cares if there's no wedding, no ring... YET....  This is the fun of planning a wedding, thinking of all the ideas you have and not having to pay anything for it :)<br>  <br>  I hope this helps some... :)<br>  <br>  Good luck, sweetie!!|`|w1necKzYaa	Just because you get engaged does not mean you hae to get married right away! geeze I know one couple that was engaged for like 32 years! and tell him that you will not wait forever unless you really will but my advice is don't wait forever cause then you will regret it! be sure to tell him that engagement is not immediate! <br>  <br>  You have to sit down and talk to him about engagement and marriage and all that otherwise you will never know what is going on!

You're not expected to be able to know everything about everyone or that he liked you and wasn't naturally that way.  I have to say, I wouldve definitely had problems with that guy.  Anyway, you were having problems, and you found a way out.  Someone asked if you wanted help and you accepted the help.  There's nothing wrong with it.  Explain this to that irritating guy.  Or not.  I'd tell him leave me alone.  Actually, I probably wouldve hit him.  LOL|`|c2b0c54ac5bc43be413eb1675d56c4ffaa	Don't worry about it.  M sounds like a total douchebag.  He deserved it.

Gg4myfv1aa	Don't pick sides<br>  <br>  Love them both with all your heart.  They both will need it.<br>  <br>  Don't let one trash the other to you.  Tell them you will not pick sides.<br>  <br>  You have to realize that it's their marriage and their choice.  It's a very sad situation and your parents are not going lightly towards that decision.   Your parents love you deeply, and have likely done a lot to stay together for your welfare and well being.  That said, you cannot make your parents get along better.  You cannot change your parents behavior towards one another.  <br>  <br>  Getting divorced hurts emotionally and financially.  Many couples go through a great deal to learn to stay together because of their children and the investment of time and effort that has been made in the past.  Divorce is a last resort.<br>  <br>  Besides letting your parents each know that you love them, you may want to see a counselor about your emotional well being and to gain some tools to deal with what's going on with your parents.  <br>  <br>  Don't be scared.   Don't be scared about your relationship with either parent.  Don't be scared of talking to a psychologist or school counselor about overwhelming emotions you might be feeling.  <br>  <br>  You'll get through it, and so will your parents.|`|qwxi3NjFaa	i did nothing when my mom & dad divorced. i was what . . 7 years old? i didn't really mind & i don't miss having a dad.|`|AA10304743	That depends. For one, it might be a relief. With my parents, I was glad that they got divorced: my dad is a monster. I was happy for an occasion that is not supposed to be. It was also sad for me, what he put my mother through was unbelievable. Really all that you can do is accept it. It is not your position to oppose to it, for it is not your marriage; it's not in your hands. Just try to make light of the situation. Hope this helps. Bye!!!|`|LXihMg9Waa	I would suggest doing what I did:<br>      Inform them that a divorce would result in your complete lack of respect for either of them.<br>      While I am opposed to the very concept of marriage I am more opposed to the idea of a divorce.<br>      While I am opposed to virtually all forms of organized religion I have no respect whatsoever for someone who stood in a church before every friend and family member and before their god to take the oath:  "Till death do us part."<br>      To separate after taking such an oath before their god and before their friends and family makes them both hypocrites.  When your parents do such a thing, as far as I am concerned, they have lost all credibility with regards to anything they say.<br>      This gives them no authority and no right to instruct, guide or educate you.<br>      <br>      I informed my own parents that if they were to get a divorce I would view them with nothing but utter contempt.  I told them that I would disown the both of them and I have.<br>      I have not spoken to either of them for over ten years now.<br>     Not on their birthday, not on Mother's/Father's day, not on Thanksgiving and not on Christmas.  I have not even seen them or responded to a letter even once and I will not until they resume their marriage and reunite.<br>      Their divorce was not only a fantastic display of hypocrisy, but by virtue of the fact that they had produced three children- irresponsible.  They destroyed our family because of their selfishness and I will never, EVER forgive or forget it.  <br>      The resulting shared-custody order deprived me of my childhood and I can never get it back.<br>      I bitterly resent it and will regard them as the scum of the earth for as long as I live.<br>  <br>    When two people join together and produce children their children should come first.  Period.|`|Rxc8UtNraa	Sweetie you don't do anything, if you think that your parents is heading to that level, tell them how and what you think as a daughter,nothing less. If they made up their mind about divorcing each other, that's their choice,you don't have anything to do with it, not your fault. For a long time now, when couples divorce,children is the one that suffers because they  think that it's them that cost their parents separation.<br>      One thing that you can do is let your parents have their own freedom, maybe it's time for them to let go before they loose respect on each others............|`|ab17cb5d2c7b02077691844e99ce7c2caa	nothing..that is between your mother and father, they are not divorcing you.|`|1eb0fedd0e620f9451655790a8a29b30aa	My parents got divorced in 1997 (wow 10years) sorry, But I can tell you they are happier no than they have ever been.  They get along better and everything.  At first it will seem really bad, but in my case, in the long wrong everything worked out for the best.  So unfornuteately there is nothing you can do, but just want them to be happy.|`|AA10289637	well for my case my parents are going to divorce soon.So for i look at the reasons why my mother want a divorce from my father.so if you see that the given reason is reasonable than yoy have to think that there is really something wrong with your parents.becouse they cant live together anymore.so for me i will be living with my mother.coz it is impossible to live with my father.he has carrecter problems....<br>  but for some other people like you ...i would like to say tht getting a divorce for a couple is easy but it does affect the kids.so if u see ur parents wnt to go for it thn make them understand.tell them it will not be easy for u all to live without father or mother...i knw how does it feel like to be seperate from one of the parents.so tell them abt ur feelings and try to consult them...<br>  all the best...|`|PodN8X8Eaa	I've went through 3 divorces before I was 14 years old..I don't know. <br>  I think my parents were selfish and didn't think about how their actions would impact my life.  I have to debate about where to spend holidays and then feel guilty because I'm not with the other one and it really pisses me off, especially now that I have a child. They both want to see my son but I have to use all of my vacation time to see them separately so they each get time with him (and me).<br>  Tell them to hold off an dating new people and to respect your opinion about those people and to take it into consideration...my parents never cared whether I liked their new significant others or not...even when I voiced my opinion about it.<br>  Remind them that it's not all about them...you're in this too...<br>  Good luck.

Personally, i would've left that one alone. Anyway, since this fiasco already got started, instead of sending your friend to do it for you (which is very lame and immature), go talk to the guy yourself in person. If you told her, she's probably already gave him some idea (besides the fact that you've been doing this semi-flirting for awhile now).|`|Njgof6hNaa	Using friends as go-betweens is tempting, but sometimes it's best to just go to the source. Talk to this guy. Show an interest. Ask him if he'd like to talk and see you outside of work. You can always bring up a new movie that's coming out and see a day show with him. If that's too fast then you could always ask him to tag along for a lunch period at work.

G4AxssFJaa	I reread your question and I realized I assumed the **** was sex... but I suppose the *** could be many things from smoke to **** off..... now depending on whatwas ment in the **** ill change my answer...<br>  <br>  But if you kissed him before any sexual things could happen I would agree with the other answers you simply might have jumped the gun on a confused or bi curious friend.... in either of those cases all you can do is appologize and tell him it wont ever happen again and sort of try to salvage the friendship.....<br>  <br>  and if he is coming out of the closet you just might have struck a bit suddenly and not on his terms so it scared him a bit.<br>  <br>  I never thought I would use this annalogy in my life and never in a homosexual q&a but, the most likely reason he is acting so annoyed is the same reason in Pretty woman, If you have seen it after she first sleeps with the rich guy her room mate who is also a hooker asks her did you kiss him? ... Kissing is often viewed as something even more personal than sex in some ways... for some sex is viewed as forfilling carnal desires but kissing that is not so much a carnal desire than it is a intamacy exchanged to show love or emotional connection..... You said he was either experimenting or quite possibly just beging his journey out and while well sexual experiments are just that physical sexual... if hes unsure of where he stands its like a one night stand... I think the sex confused him even more and he is now using the Kiss as an excuse... yeah he did the nasty but it wasnt like he is gay he had no emotional fealings about it... it was just physical... most likely this is what hes telling himself but you cant have purely physical with zero emotion... hes confused and f taking that confusion out on you and the kiss...... Im not gonna tell you what your next move should be but patiance and maybe a kind of step backwards like only a rfiend can" hey Im sorry was caught up in the moment didnt mean to upset you" kinda thing might smooth things over to restart things and let things happen more smoothly.... your not sayiong you are sorry for kissing him only sorry for him fealing uncomfortable....|`|Z3W8t5QJaa	Well, probably because hes not gay? Just imagine a girl kissed you? It would completely startle you.|`|xxC5SihZaa	you should tell him your sorry u miss read the signs, and it wont happen again, after all friends should be understanding if he cant deal with it then tell him u are there when hes ready to talk.<br>  good luck.|`|Bc4ZDVk4aa	try get him to talk to you about it..maybe he was unsure about his sexuality and now he knows hes not gay..you need to sort it out hes acting like a child now.

rAvZ9yGcaa	They're your friends.  They're just concerned.  It is kind of weird, but who am I to talk?  I mean, if a senior can date a freshman, why can't a 13 year old date an 11 year old?  <br>  <br>  Your friends probably just find the age difference weird.  Age difference is a biggie when you're young because eventually you'll reach an age where it's illegal to be with him.  Age difference is probably the root of the problem.|`|zWHCwNRXaa	if they were you're real friend then they would support your realatioinship, even if they didn't agree with your decesion they would have found a way to reach out to you but they wouldn't stop talking to you, and they would want you to be happy.|`|zCZGmSvWaa	Well they'd be your real friends if they supported your decision. It seems kind of harsh just to not talk to you because of that. <br>  <br>  But do you think they're using you? Think first of why they'd do that and what they gain from you.|`|NZWQ6Zulaa	How young r you missy?|`|tE9ME5jhaa	maybe your friends are just jealous of your boyfriend. are you spending alot of time with him. if you are then maybe they feel like your neglecting them. this happened to me too and i asked my friends whats wrong and they told me that i was spending too much time with my bf. ask them the reason why they want you to break up with him and maybe that will solve the problem.|`|efTvaFFFaa	well it depends on how old YOU are, if you were a late teen, like 15,16,17 + then it WOULD be kinda weird it think....
b2TPgebMaa	Well first of all, you don't have to stop liking white guys. There are plenty of white guys out there who would date outside their race. If you're in high school, there's probably alot of pressure there for sure. Highschool is a time where people are still figuring eachother out, I'm sure this guy likes you but he's afraid to show it. It could be anything, intimidation, what his friends or family might think etc. <br>  <br>  But if he truly liked you, he wouldn't give a rats *** about what anybody would think and just ask you out - And that would be great, but if he's too worried about what others might think of the situation, then he's not worth it.|`|TF9hZZxYaa	Ask him if he likes chocolate, if he says yes tell him then we should go out together... say it as if it was a joke. he will say yes... u go out and u will tell him that u liked him long time ago...after this date don't call him or talk to he will follow u. but always stay serious after the first date.|`|evOxVceEaa	you wouldn't know unless you try first<br>  <br>  assumptions are not bad however the best thing to do is to know him first or get to know each other (communicate)<br>  <br>  don't be insecured|`|OdRpeFG6aa	he probably  likes the other girl and maybe he just thinks ur cute. but either way he kinda sounds like a jerk for acting that way in front of his friends :(|`|Wd09Iy0zaa	hey,skin color doesnt matter.give it a try.|`|9cBAUMnNaa	Ok let's just put the race card aside because in these days in times it should not be relevant so it doesn't deserve our time worrying about it. <br>  <br>  That being said, talk to him. Guys look at all pretty girls and it sounds like you are a pretty girl. They also keep their options open. He may like the other girl and like you too. He may go with whoever shows the most response. I would flirt with him, see if he flirts back, drop hints that you two should hang out. If he's just being shy because he is afraid you will reject him be a little more blatant and give him your number. Like whatever guys float your boat girl. Guys are still guys no matter what they look like. Better a hot white guy than someone that doesn't turn you on that others would approve of more. If you limit yourself you could miss out on the love of your life!|`|AA11440402	I was preppy rich white boy in highschool who had crush on preppy rich black girl who actually lived in my neighborhood. But i was too much of a sally to pursue it I dont know something is really intimidating about it. Anyways i moved from rhe urban east to WHITE WHITE WHITE montana and have yet to be with a non white/asian girl. I wish i had manned up and done something about it. <br>  <br>  Anyways its hard, but talk to him let him know you are interested, and see where it goes.|`|EatzEjhiaa	white guy here. like black girls. come on, we have a half white half black president now. Unless you live in rural alabama, i'd bet your crush don't care if you white black or purple if he likes you. If he has to know you better to chat with you, he prob'ly isn't gonna respond to someone asking if you look pretty, especially if other people answer. And don't think about that other girls skin, but what is it about her that makes him feel comfortable enough to ask for a hung. Might be he's known her a while, might be she talks to him, might be he's not attracted to her, might be anything. But mainly, speaking for many white guys, girls don't have to be a certain color.|`|Njgof6hNaa	The girl who said that kinda sounds like a *****. No offense if she's a friend, but to put you on the spot like that was wrong. <br>  How you feel about this guy is fine. It's hard to say if he feels the same way about you. He might not be sure about his feelings. Just smile at him whenever you see him. Guys know when a girl likes them. Talking to him works too, because as you said, he doesn't talk to people he doesn't know. Most people don't. So get to know him. He might be worth knowing or maybe not. The thing about a crush, is that it's easy to make them more important than they merit. Get to know him and learn how he feels about you before you fall for him. He's also not the only white guy out there. There are plenty more. LOL, which is funny to say, but totally true. I'm a mexican chick who likes white guys. It's not intentional, but I happen to like them.|`|aWZP3JJlaa	Okay .. well ? Just tell him how you fell. and the girl u sed he talks to and asks for hugs but shes not really pretty ? well uneed to have a real good personality . like just go and talk to him. look what if unever went and told him how u feel ? wat if he did like u? see u would lose that chance .. We all live with Options .. and its better to take the chances with options, because that chance might not come around again, like what if u dont ask him out? and he really liked you but didnt want to show it? im a guy :) idont show gurls how i feel, until ihave a feeling they are into me . soo juhs go and talk to him, no hes not worried about colours . Racism has kindah finished, not really ? but has gone down. soo Go For Gold :)|`|aNlT1NRqaa	Talk to him.<br>  He may like you, but be afraid of you. Some guys (girls too) think "they're too good to be interested in me" and never get the courage to go ask.<br>  What's the worst that can happen? He says "No"?<br>  <br>  I'm white, I've dated black, Hispanic, Thai. I've been shot down many times, but I never worried about race, just if I found them attractive and interesting. You may not go right to dating, but you could become friends & date later.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Anyone who's stupid enough to dislike someone just because of their race isn't worth it, that's the bottom line.|`|2EdVsgciaa	Girl, you have been asking the same question for months...first, it was the skater white guy, now it's the preppy white guy.. Either ask them out or shutup about it b/c sooner or later, they're gonna get sick of the cat and mouse chase...stop being so nervous and go for it.<br>  <br>  = ]|`|AA10347643	Dont be in a hurry. Just relax and have patience. Things will be alright and you will achieve what you want. But remember dont ignore your studies. Give first priority to your studies.|`|bgtNYOp5aa	There is nothing wrong with liking the different race. My girl is Mexican and I am white. I also like black girls.|`|TcfyaI0Waa	i say forget him im white too so call me i know for a fact you will like me better (314)956-8119|`|xWoJooeMaa	aww this sounds totally cute and your not even jelous of the other girls!!! well i couldnt tell you if he likes you or not because i cant really see body language because i cant really tell by the sounds of it :( but good luck|`|ptyBSoGjaa	Why cant you say guy.. i dont get why everything has to be labled black or white these days , no offence....|`|FkUkKXJZaa	There is nothing wrong with being a black if u are black then it doesnt matter just tell him that u like him im sure if he likes u too then he will be agree|`|LvWgMLEGaa	You can't let your skin color let you down!<br>  Go for it.!|`|0CL99Hcmaa	yes! go for it|`|0ky4TktEaa	Haha stop worrying so much. I'm black and 98% of the my exes and the people i've ever liked have been white; my boyfriend of 2 years is white. It's not uncommon in the big picture. However, schools tend to promote very cliquish behavior. There are some very defined boundaries (as well as some that aren't so defined) that separate people into groups. Doing that all your life eventually puts you in a position that even though you may not be racist, you don't tend to approach people that are extremely different from you in any way aside from handling business. Approaching someone to ask for their number or to flirt is hard enough for most people; asking out someone of a different race or culture can be even harder. You have no idea how they'll respond and if you've never done it yourself, you don't know how you'll respond later on. <br>  <br>  So believe me, i understand where you're coming from with this. It's only weird for those who haven't done it or just won't. Often, one person just needs to get over the thought of "what will other people say?". So go ahead, flirt away. Get to know him better. You aren't wasting your time; you just need to understand that interracial dating sometimes takes a bit longer than same-race dating.|`|3pBKQzbRaa	No...he just may not be the white guy for you.  There is someone out there for everyone.  Try just being his friend for a little while.  See how he treats you as a friend and if he shows signs of predudice to other people when he's not paying attention to his own actions.  <br>  Then you will save yourself face...you wont have to go through the whole rejection...you may even realize that you aren't even that into him...or you may catch his eye|`|GokA3YGkaa	I don't think you're wasting your time liking white guys.  I know a lot of white guy with black girl, relationships.  However, as with any crush, sometimes their eyes are after someone else.  Doesn't mean that's how it would be forever but keep that in mind, that just because he might not be interested in you now doesn't mean he won't later.. and it definitely doesn't mean white guys do not like you.  Besides, they may assume you aren't interested in them and so never consider it.. or maybe that's why they're so awkward about it because they don't want to make you feel awkward incase you thought it would be weird.<br>  <br>  Start out asking to hang out with him sometime.. totally on a friendship level.. do homework together or whatever.. go to the mall.. whatever... just to hang out.  You'll get a better vibe that way.
aIpmRQI6aa	Oh yeah he likes you, if he is blushing!! Oh yah!|`|PAUB1Sm3aa	I think he likes you.<br>  He just has an odd way of showing you.<br>  I think you should confront him. Or else the cycle will go on and on and you'll go insane.|`|pPKvuSCGaa	Em well to be quite honest with you it could be yes he likes you or no he dosnt or his just a big weirdo. What he does is what this guy i thot liked me did, and i still dont know if he does or dosnt. But anyways some guys tend to give serious looks to girls they like coz they are afraid to let them know their real feelungs and also just incase you dont like him or he dsont want to feel like the ''weak'' one between you two.<br>  <br>  if you can - can u please answer mine.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080926230656AAv4jfB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|ter1DMPJaa	well lets see, <br>  <br>  he's trying to make you think he's doing good<br>  +<br>  that he has other girls to choose from<br>  +<br>  and that it doesn't bother him<br>  =<br>  he likes you.|`|HbutqOx6aa	Sounds like he' s embarassed about what happened between you guys.|`|PUStoav4aa	he likes you & is just trying to show off to you like "oh im not thatt obsesed with you" but he really must like you & has a strange way of showing it
BFLA9Xysaa	yes i find it very attractive for a girl to ask me out<br>  <br>  idk i just think its cute<br>  <br>  and not all guys have the guts to walk up to the girl he likes and ask her out<br>  <br>  mostly cuz of rejection<br>  <br>  us guys fear that most<br>  <br>  you really should|`|jYy6dDAZaa	Yes, but realize that the asker pays,chooses and leads.This may only happen until you 2 are an item or whatever.|`|Al8E78bvaa	yes, of course. we really like when we realize that a girl likes us - it makes things easier.  Just try to do it without being so obvious, if you're not sure how he will react. Just suggest that the two of you do something together like catch a movie or dinner.|`|AA10465419	I think it's okay. We live in the 20th century it's okay to ask a boy out in my opinion. Stop being shy. He maybe shy to and want to ask you out. But don't be all aggressive about it though. |`|UbfjHhePaa	Well I always think its the boy but if he is the shy type or the one that tries to hide its a good idea if you ask him straight forward especially if it seems like he is leading you on|`|AA11486439	hell yea.<br>  most of the times guys are pretty nervous bout asking a girl out. and for me it would be hella sik if a girl asked me out. it would mean alot that she actually likes me. 
0jUGSaZPaa	*Target<br>  *Kohls<br>  *Bed Bath and Beyond<br>  *Macy's<br>  <br>  We actually registered REALLY early.. Our wedding is still about 13 months away... But, we're starting out fresh...  We'll have NOTHING to furnish our house with... So, now on any holidays from now until our wedding, family and friends can view our registries and use that as a gift guide, if they choose....<br>  <br>  Reason we registered at Target, Kohl's and Bed Bath & Beyond is because they are located everywhere, $$ are low, and they have great stuff!!  Bed, Bath & Beyond has a GREAT return policy too.. Pretty much "they don't have one"....  :)<br>  <br>  Macy's has Martha Stewart's Blue for KitchenAid stuff, which we want for our kitchen.  Plus, they had a "Sip and Scan" party that was so much fun registering at...  We got free glasses, and tote, and vendors were there to answer any questions about any products you were interested in.  :)|`|AW1dCzH0aa	I am registered at Crate and Barrel, Macy's, Tiffany and Simon Pearce.  My fiance is registered at REI.  I really wanted to register at Target, but their return policy is terrible and I just didn't want to deal with it if I had to return/exchange something.  Macy's has things in all price ranges, stuff is always on sale, and they've got tons of coupons.  Crate and Barrel has things in a wide variety of prices, so it worked out well.  Tiffany and Simon Pearce are both expensive, but I registered for a few nicer items from each of those places.  <br>  <br>  We registered 14 months before our wedding because we had an engagement party.  People wanted to buy gifts, so we went ahead and registered.|`|7G4hisdzaa	We registered at Target and JCPennys.  We really didn't want to register at Pennys but my mother insisted we register for china and it was the only place that had china at a price we could stomach.<br>  Turns out they had a lot that we wanted.<br>  Pennys gave us a free engagement photo session and photo, Target gave some mini-clutch that I think had something to do with wedding planning but it was so cheap I threw it out.|`|ge3meKYEaa	I did Macys and Target.<br>  <br>  5 months out and check it to make sure things didn't get discounted.<br>  <br>  Target was a nightmare- I got broken things and had trouble returning them.  Macy's was great.<br>  <br>  Macy's gave me a bag but they give you points on everything you buy and gifts and I got $200 to spend in the store after my wedding|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	We are registered at Bed Bath and Beyond, Lowes and Boscov's.  We need things for the home but we also need a new stove, fridge, etc. so gift cards will go a long way.|`|4UUVrWXtaa	i haven't started.. but we plan to register at Target (we love target) and Bed, Bath and Beyond (has everything)<br>  we are getting married 9/12/09... i have no idea when we should register..|`|Q3ibC4Rnaa	I'm registered at Bed Bath and Beyond, Williams and Sonoma, and Lowes Hardware.<br>  <br>  I know the last one seems off, but my soon-to-be husband wants certain things likes tools and such that can help around the house. Seeing as how we're buying a house within a month after the wedding, we thought this would be handy.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest to keep your list short. I've had some complaints about it, but I've heard so many stories in the past about how one couple really needed certain items, but got everything else! If you put too much on the list it's unlikely you'll get those things you really need. I would also include a good price range of things, some people that don't know us that well seemed to get us cheaper items, while closer family members spent a little more money.<br>  <br>  As soon as the invites go out, go ahead and make a registry. Because even though people will wait til last minute to buy, they will start asking after they get an invite (and remember - it's not cool to put your registry on your invite! Most couples today are signing up for free wedding websites and putting the info there. It *IS* okay to include your wedding website with your invite!)|`|dc4883361b4a9ea867331eed902ded8daa	We registered at Crate & Barrel, Target, and a few items at Williams-Sonoma (mostly because I work there and my managers expected me to). We liked the process at C&B the best because of the friendly service we received and the bridal parties they host every couple months or so. You get the store to yourself with other couples, employees to explain products and help you narrow down what you like. And good food; I'm a sucker for food.<br>  <br>  Target we registered at for our friends and family who have a smaller budget. The return policy sucks, but we hope to avoid any mishaps by asking people to include gift receipts and maybe printing an extra one.<br>  <br>  Both places had stuff we liked, good quality at decent prices. We went out for a day of registering 5 months before the wedding, right after the new season products hit the shelves. You don't want to do it too early, because as the seasons change, items like bedding and bath change and start to become discontinued. If you want to make sure you don't do the whole process again, call the stores you are looking into and ask them when they recommend you and your fiancé to come in.<br>  <br>  C&B gift :: A small hand-blown heart shaped bowl and small cards to stick in shower invites.<br>  Target gift :: Coupons for store products, free smoothies, free chocolate, and a $20 giftcard. Also recieved shower info cards. SuperTargets also treat you to a 6" cake for free, but we didn't go there.<br>  Williams-Sonoma gift :: A small recipe file that fits their recipe cards and shower info cards.<br>  <br>  All these stores provided a list of things you might need to purchase for your house. Crate & Barrel's was the most complete, but Williams-Sonoma does the best at explaining types of cookware and dining items.<br>  <br>  We also went to register at Kohl's. The process took a long time because their computers were horribly slow. And their products have gone down in quality in recent years. The towels were rough to the touch and their bedding was made from extremely cheap fabric. The cookware and electrics they carry can be found at places like Target and Bed, Bath & Beyond, so just skip this unless you like some of their decorations.|`|884v4VhGaa	The Bay. <br>  <br>  Can't stand it, although I suspect all stores are the same. Had to spend two hours solid shopping for stuff... and then didn't get any of it. <br>  <br>  It's difficult to figure out exactly what the item is, because the name on the registry is the name they have in inventory, which may or may not be intuitive to match to the actual item. And stuff keeps getting discontinued! It's not their fault, but it really defeats the purpose of registering if none of the things we register for will be available. It seems that any good quality small appliance will be replaced by one which does more.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Bed, Bath & Beyond and Sears, 9 months in advance. Both were easy to do in-store nad online and had items from 99 cents and up. Both have easy return policys and exchange policies. BB&B has an incentive program but I don't know much about it, we're not really in it for the freebies.<br>  <br>  We looked into Macy's but they had almost nothing in-store and expected us to do everything online and their customer service was really poor - the girls work on commission so the sales girl put a TON of stuff on the registry we didn't even WANT because she said we would "need" it. Very rude! They also have a giftcard program where you get a giftcard based on what people buy for you which is a ploy to get you to register for higher-end items and makes the sales girls more commission. Nice. <br>  <br>  We also looked at Target but the return policy is heinous - you have to retun and exchnage from the same deprtment - ie a picture frame has to be exchanged for something from that department, not kitchen wear or something else. Not our style. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|xuiSfzgraa	I registered at Target and Bed Bath and Beyond.  I chose target for the people that may not be able or don't want to spend a lot of $$.  I choose Bed Bath and Beyond because it is nation wide and they have evertyhing that I wanted to register for:)  So far everything is going well with both.|`|TWwGN6Uzaa	I'm registered at Target, Macy's at CB2.  I think CB2 is online-only, but I love their modern, cheap stuff.<br>  <br>  My wedding's not until October, but I put links to the registry on my website.  I figured I'll register only for a few things for now and add more if we get everything we want.     :)|`|AdIrjmV7aa	With one wife we registered at Norstrom.  With another we registered at Target. During this time of recession you should just include bank deposit slips in your invitations.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, Kohls. Love it! Yes, I got a $20 gift card to Target for registering. I registered 5 months before my wedding (because I had an early shower).
cd9725004c8aabbb8773f8aa7fddaca1aa	He probably does.  The stuff he does seems like it.  Make sure you tell your loud mouth/gossipy friends... or if you don't have any, people you know like that.  It will get around.  Just whatever you do DON'T ask him out.  That is just not appealing.  If he doesn't ask you out in a week or two, settle for 2nd best... best friends.  Eventually it will turn into a relationship. |`|E3O2Gi0Uaa	Absolutely. You have alot to offer. Believe in yourself alittle more. I think he likes you.

9XJZB0Emaa	There are three reasons for wich I do not believe they actually pay for the dresses.  1) when I went with a friend of mine, she was taking a bit to get in and out of dresses and I struck up conversation with one of the consultants and asked why they chose such ugly dresses sometimes.  She told me that with the particular designer they do not get to pick the samples, they are just sent.  So to me that says that the designer sends them what they want and I could not see anyone paying for a horrible dress.   2) When we were doing this shopping we were looking for a particular MS dress and of 7 shops in two cities, it seemed they all had the same styles as samples.  3) A friend of mine's family owns a bridal shop here in town and they are wonderful people, but they mis manage money horribly.  The kind of people who are always broke and have bill collectors after them.  Nice Nice people, but credit and cash flow issues, so I could not see them buying the large amount of dresses they have in their store or being able to get credit for the purchases.   I think that the shops probably have to pay out of pocket to a point, but the majority is probably sent to them.  I do know that some designers have requirements of shops to sell their gowns (working capitol, square footage of shops, business plans and so on).  I am curious to, I am going to look back tomorrow and see the answers.  You could also re post the question in the afternoon where more people will see it and answer it.|`|rI7J9M8taa	You can start a bridal consignment store without purchasing anything.  I did that and when I sold a gown the owner got 60% and I got 40%.  During these tough economic times, more brides will be looking for less expensive gowns and also be anxious to resell their gowns and get some money back.  I did the same thing with headpieces, veils and jewelry.  A lot of my business came "word of mouth" because no one else was doing it.|`|AaoclPYCaa	Bridal shops only pay about $50 each for those dresses.  They have them made and inported from China.  Just look on ebay. You can find the same dresses on ebay as you do in the stores they are just a lot cheaper.
es0SoSEcaa	She might be confused.. her initial feeling is fr that guy but maybe after being close with you, then she somehow has develop a feeling (that she can never describe even to herself) , hence, she might be doing it (looking at you) unconsciously...<br>  Give her some time and meanwhile, continue being you ... & let see where it will go from here on ....|`|1fd7wm5zaa	Maybe she has a crush on you and since its the initial stages, she is trying to judge you and compare you with the other bloke.

She has to recognize her own feelings first.|`|yhQXJ8rbaa	she's staring because she likes you, i think. <br>  <br>  oh and next time you catch her staring, smile at her. that way she'll feel less like she's been caught and more like you like having her look at you.<br>  <br>  and tell her you like her.

The ones who wants sex with alot of women and who doesn't like to have to refer to or dictated by a woman on how he runs his life and the kind who wants the comfort and security of having a woman who loves him and stand by him all his life through ups and downs and are willing to compromise regarding his lifestyle.|`|2d604a0513c3e9ace8f80563ffec59dcaa	Marriage is OK -- weddings are the single biggest wastes of time, energy and money yet devised by satan himself. ALL men hate weddings. Every damn one of us. We may lie about it, but it's true. The poor groom has to endure months of watching his bride-to-be become bridezilla as she prepares for 'her' day. Yes, that's right -- the groom, (you remember, the other part of this two-part equation), is 100%, totally forgotten and dismissed from the whole charade. Oh, the bride will pretend to include him on some inane decision about what color table cloth should be on the gift table but she will quickly rip off his head and spit down his throat if he dares to give the incorrect answer. This is what kills men; we are creatures driven by logic, women are driven by emotion. Is there anything on earth more emotional and devoid of logic than a DAMN WEDDING? Answer: NO. Yet we all are forced to stand by while the whole circus is jammed up our a**. Yes, we hate weddings. They are stupid, they cause undo hardships on family, friends, finances and, yes, even marriage.|`|AA11325752	u only sleep with one women rest of your life|`|AA11459134	marriage is overated|`|8a9d515dee3654bae2e52b9b93cabee1aa	Cowboy Bill you are the man.  Best answer I have ever seen.|`|AA11073452	The part I love about being married: Having some one to share my life, my thoughts, my likes and dislikes, my strengths and weaknesses with without fear of reprisal.  having someone committed to me even when I'm going through the down times.  Knowing that my wife will always be there for me.  Having another viewpoint on the things in life we experience, that's not saying I'll always agree or sometimes even understand her view but I do value the input.  There is so much more I won't take the time to expand on.  And being there for her, knowing there is one person who trusts me enough that she is free to say or do anything without fear of destroying the commitments we made to each other.  Having a life partner that  wants the best for me and knows I want the best for her.  <br>  <br>  I won't go into the happiness that raising two great kids together gave us, that's another subject but certainly is and was a big part of the marriage.  Obviously there were some hard times but they fade when compared to the good times.<br>  <br>  What I hate???<br>  <br>  The downside for me is: Sometimes I like to be alone and undisturbed, My wife doesn't understand that part of me,  maybe since she doesn't like to be alone.
d62310b3e25bb263db275c523c9cfe86aa	you should find out what you need to do to get a courthouse marriage, and figure out citizenship rules, etc. Once legally married, the military should let her come with you and put you in base housing, or give you a stipend for off base housing. <br>  You could also probably be asked to be stationed near where she currently lives.<br>  Have a big wedding/recep. later, after the baby.<br>  Another reason to get married now is that hopefully the military insurance will cover the baby.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Just do it... solve the problems later.|`|R7b150Iyaa	What is your question?|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Not sure what you are asking, but you two need to be living together-she needs your help.
8KMdXKTLaa	This is pretty confusing since I'm from the outside looking in. There's really hardly anything anyone can tell you to do, since it's been going on for a while.<br>  <br>  Here's my advice. Call him, meet up with him and have a heart to heart discussion. Facebook is not going to help and you should really just ignore that. Tell him you're not playing games and you want him to be honest with you. After that, it's all on you.|`|miI17WJ5aa	I'm having a lot of trouble reading this question, but one thing I hear loud and clear is stress and confusion. I don't think any relationship that makes you feel this way is worth the trouble. |`|lhNVeQjPaa	 that sounds like a lot of confusion for both of you. i wish you guys could talk it out. its hard when you cant get in touch easily. he probably still likes you tho|`|HbutqOx6aa	He' s playing games get rid of him, you don' t need that kind of crap.
AA11094582	My BF did this to me 2 days ago.Its not cheating but flirting with someone when u r in a relationship isnt good! And the fact that u feel bad about it shows that it was wrong. Good thing u stoped it on time!|`|9K6NfT30aa	hahahahhahha u r funny what was chating weit webcam if that that is chathing|`|x3LclBZ0aa	if all youre doing is chatting about something unimportant then its not cheating BUT if youre actually disclosing personal info and details of your life, relationship, etc...then that will be considered emotional cheating.|`|Po1QAWTnaa	that's not cheating but if you had bad intentions then you might as well have cheated bc in your mind you betrayed you boyfriend. i wouldn't tell him bc its gonna weaken your relationship over something that wasn't physical!!!
Ss4kzYCYaa	I'm not exactly sure what you mean by virtual marriage. I know some people get married or partner in mmorpgs. I actually 'got married' and had a small virtual wedding in a game called Second Life (SL) to my now real life partner (who I moved to be with). We met through that game a couple years ago and it was what we both wanted. We don't play it anymore but we're still 'married' in it. lol<br>  <br>  In my experience I've seen good and bad from virtual marriages in SL. I've known couples who actually married later in real life and are very happy. And I know people who take advantage of the fact that it's online and lie about everything.. their names, themselves and the fact that they are already married in real life. It may be virtual, but real feelings are still involved and people get hurt bad. So my advice would be to approach with caution. :)|`|h2CyxOEnaa	hi. ET|`|FCbO1ij5aa	And what is a virtual marriage?<br>  <br>  ( : o )|`|ICjBorriaa	I've heard of people just changing their facebook relationship status to married to their best friends, but often it is just a joke I think.<br>  <br>  but a serious version of virtual marriage is not realistic, you could have feelings for people but marriage usually suggests physical intimacy.|`|AA10420452	it is stupid. i would say it is for the losers who can not or will not get married. they need to get a life.|`|YG288fG4aa	No sex.|`|OhiNV9a4aa	I wish my husband and I had gotten married virtually so I wouldn't have to smell his disgusting body odor.|`|HCf73ZsEaa	It's virtually bullshit!
mefxIQP9aa	Look, society and certain cultures make group sex or sex with multiple people seem bad.<br>  <br>  It's all about personal choice and how you go about it. No one holds you down but yourself. <br>  <br>  Sex is a beautiful thing and complex thing. Many people, however, abuse it. They cheat on their lovers. Spread STDs and other infections. Conceive numerous babies and abort it because they think the babies will slow them down or whatever foolishness they can come up with.|`|ABhmJepFaa	Yes, I have an objection. The only mean to achieve what you want is by the use of force: by putting a gun in the head of the 'attractive' peopIe. I would tell you what someone would deserve for proposing this idea, but then my question would be erased for violence. Just know that people will defend their freedom with their life if it's necessary.|`|84b2777cc69c41b43d99c853cd3c3469aa	I think that would warrant even more dishonesty and diseases like HIV would spread even faster and we would become a baby factory even more so than we are now and emotions like love would be even less meaningless. I say don't open doors you can't close.|`|Waiiu3s4aa	I think that's when swingers are involved, you can have sex with different people without jealousy or worrying that your mate will leave you for someone else.|`|2zKBJkM8aa	You had a good theme going, but then got jumbled up with side-tracked ideas and unusual choices of words.|`|GUUa1s6Laa	I agree with you so fully. Lusts is such a natural thing, why stifle it? WE were built to feel things like that for a reason. <br>  I dont know if you believe in evolution, but it is so clearly our form of ensuring the survival of our species. <br>  I also think the whole 'sex is bad' thing came from an ancient society to one, prevent women from having babies they couldnt afford to keep, deepening poverty. And two, for men to have their virgins. It seems through out history men were much more sexually promiscuous then women were (but I definitely could be wrong no one please get offended by that).<br>  Our society is slowly moving towards more accepting of 'sex before marriage' and its good. My best friend is very religious and I watch her struggle with lust and really, it is not a big deal. I do not see how it could be so sacred because most of the time it is not very beautiful. And it forms an amazing bond between two people that would be nice to know about before spending the rest of your life with them,<br>  So I agree with you.|`|OhYE3GhKaa	I thought it was an interesting question until I read further. <br>  <br>  First, people actually CAN have sex. <br>  <br>  But the problem arises when man A can have sex with woman B and she doesn't want to.|`|AA10261253	errr, you think your idea is new?  I thought " polygynandry" had been going on for thousands of years!!!!  And it didn't work!|`|bMmV6R2Jaa	Leon, Persons can already have sex with anyone they so choose consenually. It sounds like due to your upbringing you are not giving your permission to have sex , or to not feel guilty about it. Singles engage in sex with different partners for different reasons.<br>  Morality is an issue seperate from the number of  partners one has. Its more about how you FEEL About having sex, more than who you are having it with. Morality is your value system in selection of the species for regeneration  and its come down to the matter of self gratification, sport, entertainment and other related issues. So you need to decide how you feel about it and develop your OWN standards you can live with yourself..a nd others will set their own standards to adjust to their wants and needs. THats is more the definition of morality.

A friend married a guy who didn't work. He always had some "get rich quick" scheme that was going to make him money, which she always funded and they never worked out. She had a full time job, bought their house, the car, etc. He filed for divorce and is now getting half of everything. Since he had no assets of his own, he gets half the house, the furniture, her income, etc. And the court ruled that she also has to pay alimony to him. It works both ways.|`|AA11546221	It depends on if you both signed a pre-nup. agreement before you both got married. But if no pre-nup., then the law, depending on which state you live in, requires both spouses to split 1/2 of the assets etc.|`|fBGIUSfaaa	usually all assets are split his and hers.. sometimes tho he takes it all and sometimes she takes it all...|`|qK1iEcVhaa	1/2 of all combine assets, you can talk it out with each other.|`|p6ywBhaPaa	Certainley. But very complicated ie Children, Property, Work status etc etc|`|xWoJooeMaa	depends if she singed a contract thing that states he cant totch any of her things if there was to be a divorce|`|azE51WGRaa	Usually he will get will get half of whatever assets were acquired over the course of the marriage. He usually will get half of whatever savings/bonds/stocks etc. they couple shared before the divorce. What he will not get is half of her paycheck unless ordered by the court and good luck getting that from any judge (courts don't look too fondly on men receiving spousal support from women but they're fine if it's the other way around...How screwed..and I'm a woman!)

mD4wAHyqaa	U have ever right to talk to ur dad. It seem like ur mom have kept u away from him far to long. U r old enough to contact him on ur own and there is nothing she can do about it. She may resent him for what ever reason but she shouldn't have kept him away from u b/c of her reason, that wasn't fair to u.<br>  Just go to her and say look mom there's something very important that i need to talk to u about. Let her know that it may hurt her but u hope she will understand how u r feeling. Say to her mom i haven't talked to my dad in years and i feel like i'm missing a big part of my life that i been wanting for a long time but i never knew how to tell u this. Let her know that u have a whole other family out there that u need to get to know b/c u need to know ur back round for u and maybe one day for ur kids.Tell her that this is so important for u and u hope that she will support u but i have been in contact with my dad and i feel so happy that we r able to talk but i will like to go see him every once an a while b/c i love him just as much as i love u.He's my dad and that will never change.I just want to get to know him b/c after all he is my dad. Let her know that u don't need her approval b/c u r old enough to make this decision on ur own but u need her support and that's all u can ask for.|`|34550d5f2dff52eadb5794f5944a6de1aa	I am sorry, but your mom has a problem with your dad not you.  He is after all your dad, and believe it or not, but you have THE RIGHT to speak to your dad and have a relationship with him.  Any mother who denies her child this right, is really really selfish and should seek counselling.  You should tell her this as well. I dont know how old you are, but speak to another adult in your family for some support.|`|QilfSBfsaa	When was the last time your mom told you she does not like you talking to father?  Maybe she changes her mind now.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	You have every right to talk to your Father, no matter WHAT she thinks about it!  Just don't tell him any of her business!  It's against the law for her to not allow you to see or speak to your Father, unless she has a restraining order against him!  Doesn't matter if he pays child support or not!|`|BDPc9P4Faa	You have to the right to both of your parents! Thats not right for you mom to be mad about.<br>  <br>  Tell her you contacted your dad and have been talking to him, if she gets mad who cares. She'll get over it.

You need to read The Mystery Method to learn how to hook up with really hot women, you are obviously lost. Download the book in audio at the piratebay.org.<br>  <br>  They dont want the Tom Brady guy, but that type of women (hot ones, not white ones) are greedy little creatures and they like people who are "better" than them... who have higher value than them, very darwinistic but weirdly, at the same time, unhuman.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Dude, you DO look like pepe or any mexican, you are NOT spanish, because that means FROM SPAIN!! haha, or if you are, you dont look like someone from spain. I am mexican but i look spanish. Still, you need to read the book i told you about, and to go to pickup places, its lame, most woman will say its lame, and it is lame.. hah, but what is not lame is that it works, well, not for me yet, but im trying and i can see it happening very soon.|`|Z5qY016daa	Seems your going for the wrong ones... or maybe your not puting across your intentions clearly ? If your good looking and spanish, i dont know why these white women arnt falling at your feet, i know alot of white women that love latino/foreign men ! i dont know where your going wrong ! Im not from america, maybe american women arnt as keen on forien men as us british women are.|`|3wmiypiNaa	Wow haha If only i were older... I'd date you.. haha! but anyways. <br>  <br>  Some white girls are more into white guys and some aren't. It also depends on the way you could be approching someone. Or go to a dating service. I think they have things like... showing what type of girl you like. |`|qQ4AnZpQaa	It has nothing to do with your ethnicity; white chicks don't like nice guys.|`|AA11620721	First of all...don't call light skinned girls ''White Chicks''!!!|`|b3QTiMTCaa	Dude I do not understand.   Most white girls you date are wanting a freaky thing with you right?   They expect since you have a dark complexion that you are a bad boy right?   Or you must be in a wrong place.   White women always want something different.   They are all over the brothers here.   But when they marry they meet this Tom Brady sell out type of guy to settle down with in the end.<br>  <br>  You must not got game.   You should be getting some many white girls it would be crazy.   Check your ride, cloths, hair, and attitude.  You should be getting crazy with the white girls dude!
94464c65a3cf331abd994f1207860d7eaa	Just a hint - September is a very, very popular month for weddings. If you're looking for a venue, start NOW. Those weekends book a year or more in advance.|`|AA10784932	I'm planning a Sept 5th wedding. The way I looked at it is If they already have plans, then they might not be able to come, it sucks,but then again, they may cancel or just hold off on their plans for a hour or two so they can be w/ you on your day. If they don't have plans then great because hopefully your wedding is more important than any other thing that may come up! Personally, I think that on that weekend, your guest will love 3 days off! Who wouldn't? Especially if you have traveling guests, that gives them an extra day to relax or even spend time w/ your familes.Send out your save the date cards once you figure out a date that way people w/out plans so far, will now have something to look forward to! Good Luck & congrats!|`|4UUVrWXtaa	We are getting married Sept 12, 2009..<br>  because i took into consideration my period since is very stable..<br>  and since we are having a ceremony at church.. they we only able to do 2pm on that date..<br>  So, if you are having a ceremony at church.. talk to them (or the venue) first and make sure what they have available..<br>  we first had planned everything for August 29, but our church doesn't do ceremonies in August.. <br>  so it really depends on what is available..<br>  If there are no obstacles like i had... have your wedding on Sept 12...<br>  it will be cool to know that someone else is getting married that day (for sure).<br>  congratulations and let me know what you decide to do..|`|sGP6s7uraa	They may already have holiday travel plans so I would go with the 9-19.|`|xuiSfzgraa	Holiday weekend prices are usually more expensive, so if a lot of your guest are strapped for cash it might be better to go with a weekend later in the month.  As a parent I actually try to avoid going to anything over labor day weekend as school starts the week after and I try to stay home so that my daughter can get everything around for school and be rested her first week back, so if you have a lot of people with children who will be traveling that could be an issue for them.  If it were me I would plan it for the 19th, especially since you are only giving yourself 6 months to plan everything you might be happy to have that extra couple of weeks in the end.|`|2324ca2619e6dee826826d027a6a3effaa	We were married  over Labor Day weekend in 2007 and it went very well for us. If you are motivated you can find a place and get everything done by then. As I mentioned in your other question,the flower idea worked great or me  because there was that extra day and the florists would be closed on that Monday. People who love you and want to be at your wedding won't mind changing any plans they may have had in order to attend over Labor Day. I didn't find it to be any more expensive than any other day. Just don't do 9/9/09 as a date because every place has been booked for that date for 5 years already! :)|`|VK0czcdtaa	i say saturday,sept 19<br>  that way people wont have the kaos <br>  of the weekend and everything.<br>  either it is they ar eplanning to go somewhere<br>  or that they are tierd from the weekend..<br>  <br>  just avoid it that way the quests have a week to relax and pick <br>  yuor present or the clothing they are wearing that evening.<br>  ;]|`|rRVzWFYZaa	Don't do it Labor Day b/c a lot of people will have plans, and things will be a lot more expensive.<br>  <br>  If you have friends/family who are Jewish who you really want to come, don't do it on 9/19 because that's Rosh Hashanna.<br>  <br>  I got married 9/20/08, and we had a beautiful day!  A PP is right though--we got our 3rd choice of a reception hall, and we booked a year in advance, so get on it!|`|rpVQpJA7aa	I would go with the 19th (it would be a date with the least conflicts). I would avoid holidays...no offense but most people save holidays for vacations, etc, and going to a distant family member or friends wedding might not be exactly how they want to spend their vacation|`|2zGKZB6gaa	Personally, I would avoid the holiday weekend. I don't know if prices would really be effected but you don't want some other holiday taking away from what should be YOUR weekend.|`|MhyuXBoEaa	I am partial to September.. I got married Sept 20 so I would say the 19th :)|`|6AYA3GWWaa	I'm getting married over Labor Day weekend.  In fact, many people I know have had their weddings over three-day weekends, and it really does make it easier for everyone to make travel arrangements when they don't have to be back at work on Monday.  Plus, many of the venues I looked at (...and I looked at a lot of them!) charge less on Sunday, so again, it's great to have that next day off.<br>  <br>  BUT, with only 6 months left, you may not be able to find a reception site that isn't booked.  I started looking a year in advance, and finding an available venue has been a nightmare.  As far as expense goes, September is one of the most popular months for weddings, so "off-peak" discounts won't apply.  <br>  <br>  I was about to suggest pushing your date back to late August (not a popular wedding month, particularly in warmer climates), but people are more likely to be on vacation then.  On the other hand, if you go too late into September, everybody's schedules are too busy with work and school (for what it's worth, that's a very busy time for religious institutions as well, what with the program year starting up and all of the Jewish high holy days).<br>  <br>  My advice is to start calling the church and any possible reception venues and seeing what's available, and use that information to help make your decision (I know my wedding date changed when I couldn't book anything on my chosen date).<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|0jUGSaZPaa	1 might save you some money, but again, may not....  But, most guests might have plans already for their Labor Day weekend...  They might have a yearly ritual... And with it being six months away, I'm going to say that's not a good idea...  <br>  <br>  #2 sounds great...  And so does #3 (especially since it's my birthday!! ha ha)<br>  <br>  I don't think the 12th or 19th will change in price...  But, it doesn't hurt to ask.  Typically, Fridays and Sundays are cheaper... And if you were getting married Labor Day weekend of 2010, I would say that's fine, b/c now you have plenty of time to notify your guests about the holiday weekend.<br>  <br>  Sept. 6th would probably be cheaper, because it IS a Sunday, but you have to expect that more than the average MIGHT not show up....<br>  <br>  It's all in your liking :)<br>  <br>  If you have a vendor that you chose, approach them with all these dates and see if the rates change at all.  :)|`|Qas05nZraa	Sept. 19
dx2eJh5vaa	I had a garden wedding 3 weeks ago, so I also didn't want the Wedding March. I chose Canon in D (by Pachebel), but I didn't want the classical version. I searched iTunes, (there are so many versions)  and I found an accoustic guitar version of Canon in D, and it is so beautiful and romantic, and modern. All the guests were asking me where I found it. I recommend if you have access to iTunes, search 'Canon in D', and the artist is Lorin Nicholson (He's an Australian guitarist and it's so amazing because he's also blind!!)<br>  I also had a few other favourite songs playing before I arrived (just to set the mood for the guests). Most of these were instrumental versions of favoutite songs (all these were also found on iTunes). They were:<br>  <br>  Feather Song - The theme song from Forrest Gump*** (my sister in law chose this song at her wedding - very simple but romantic)<br>  Unchained Melody - The Righteous Brothers***<br>  Annie's Song - John Denver***<br>  From This Moment On - Shania Twain<br>  You Are So Beautiful - Joe Cocker<br>  I Can't Help Falling In Love With You - Elvis Presley***<br>  Somewhere Over The Rainbow - Israel (From the Movie 50 First Dates)<br>  <br>  ***These songs were instrumental versions by another artist, but I have listed the original artist for you.<br>  <br>  Hope these suggestions help you!|`|Eq5JuQGQaa	Unforgettable- Nat King Cole / Natalie Cole<br>    True Companion- Mark Cohn<br>     Love Of A Lifetime- Firehouse|`|rQlsLZ9Baa	I've been to weddings where they've done the these<br>  <br>  No woman no cry - Bob Marley<br>  That song from Pure Country by George Strait <br>  At Last - Etta James (personally, I think this should be a first dance song, not a march song)|`|8Ssuk2gFaa	Because you loved me-Celine Dion<br>  Bless the Broken Road-Rascal Flatts<br>  I know how the River Feels- Diamond Rio<br>  Everything-Lifehouse<br>  The Wedding Song-Kenny G|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I am using the instrumental version of these two songs:<br>  <br>  For my Bridesmaids:<br>  I'm doing a Disney instrumental song from Cinderella, but I can't find the song on youtube.. :(<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And for me:<br>  Somewhere Over The Rainbow<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSE1pCzMx_Y&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSE1pCzMx...</a>|`|sGP6s7uraa	Canon in D by Pachebel<br>  See of Love by Cat Power<br>  Unchained Melody|`|Q3ibC4Rnaa	I'm doing something different, and at first I wasn't sure how'd it go over, but after talking to family and friends it seems perfect!<br>  <br>  I'm doing a Beatles theme for for music playing during the ceremony. I have some great songs picked out while people are sitting, and one for when the wedding party walks down, my bridal march song, and also the song we walk down to after the ceremony. <br>  <br>  I know it's completely different, but it's sure to be something that people will remember. I've also seen online that a lot of modern bride's are using modern music like this!|`|AleWgjvPaa	I used the Canon in D by Pachebel and a friend of mine walked down the aisle to Blueberry Hill by Louis Armstrong.

W2rZ44Keaa	Since it is just lately that this has been happening could it be that maybe its just that something is bothering him? Some times guys can't fully express their feeling and when they get stressed or angry and they can't release it, it cause tension with people that they are closest to. It's something that men are brought up to do, don't show emotion it's the devil lol. Anyway if you could maybe try to get him to open up a little like such as asking him some indirect questions. Such as how was work. How are your parents. Anything really that could allow him to release what is bothering him. Maybe a friend is sick maybe is been working to much you just never know.

4358e7a6acd949961830438fc1f7b201aa	Probably because she drinks too much liquid! Every night before bed make her go to the bathroom.|`|MNLiNkqaaa	First of all, you have to be more sensitive about the issue "pisses her pants every night" is not the right way to be referring to this problem. This is a potentially embarrassing problem, try be kind.<br>  <br>  Secondly, having such accidents / wetting the bed indicates a much larger problem - It could be one of two things.<br>  <br>  1). She has a physical problem  - maybe with bladder weakness (not making it to the bathroom in time), unaware of when she needs the bathroom.<br>  <br>  2). She is seriously stressed out about something or in fear of something. Does she get bullied at school? Is she timid / shy? Does she have any problems?<br>  <br>  Above all - tell an appropriate adult about this problem confidentially - Your parents / a teacher.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck|`|nGhqwEdpaa	Maybe something happened to her when she was younger.

Ikd9cppcaa	Well, I can understand your wife wanting her twin sister to move to the U.S. What you need to explain to your wife is that doesn't mean that you and her are going to be her financial support. The lazy twin is just a user. She used you and her sister to get to the U.S., used the guy she married, and is using the guy across the street. I would be careful not to be "best friends" with them. Best friends aren't bashful about asking for money or a place to live either. Be nice and maybe see them sometimes but not lots. You and your wife need to stay out of her sister's business. She is a big girl and if she can't take care of herself, then she needs to go back to Europe and live with HER parents. Also....tell her if she has an accent to head to one of the makeup counters like Clarins or Clinique. They love to hire foreign accent women and the pay is good, too.

Then simply shrug it off, and remember it as a learning experience plus everyone steals something at one point or another.|`|nGhqwEdpaa	I think you should go to your parents..before they find out for themselves. I'm a mom, and I think I would be MORE upset if I found $ missing, than if my kid came to me and told me he took some. They will be hurt and upset, just be honest with them. I know its got to be embarrassing, but it will be ok. Start over and show them you can be trusted again. Good luck to you.|`|3lsAXL4vaa	i think that you should tell them cause its always worse when you get in trouvble for lying and not confessing then jsut getting in trouble for one thing. you know?  you should tell em and even if you do cry it'll show em how bad you feel you will just have to earn their trust back. trust me though its worse if you lie about it.next time just ask for some money or ask if you can do chores for some money.|`|4358e7a6acd949961830438fc1f7b201aa	Omg why would you do that! Instead of taking money from them you should get a job. That way you can pay for your own stuff and pay your dad what you took from them. I'll never do this to my parents because they work very hard to get that money and to provide a better future for us.|`|aT5jaFX8aa	1. I don't want to be rude, but if you don't have much money yourself, get a job and don't steel from your parents.<br>  <br>  2.Tell them. They won't be as mad if you tell them. They will get really mad if you try to hide it and they have to ask, "Jim, did you take money from my wallet?"  I know this is really hard, but its the right thing. The guilt is already getting to you. Do the right thing.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	That will teach you not to thieve from your parents or anyone come to that.|`|cMyPQ90vaa	if your of age you should get a job so you have your own money and stop taking money off your parents and if your not of age to get a job than you should do chores around the house and they might give you an allowance never steel off of anyone because god will punish you and your parents will definitely lose trust in you.|`|QilfSBfsaa	You have to tell your parents honestly, they will be happy if you do that, tell them you are willing to do something such as house cleaning for to compensate this stolen money.|`|R6TFrDtxaa	your parents will forgive you. Parents have a love for their kids like no other, no matter what you do. Confess. and don't do it again.|`|34550d5f2dff52eadb5794f5944a6de1aa	You stole, you dont deserve their trust.

26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	If you are not religious, don't get married in a house of worship. If you are religious, they will be more likely to have enough seating. But yes you need to decide quickly.|`|cfarZGPCaa	First of all how big is your list honey? I would say less than 50 people do it at home in the yard. More than that you'll have to consider how cramped everything will be. Will you be renting a tent? That will allow for more space and more guest, not exactly cheap but lets you have that at home close and casual wedding feel. <br>  <br>  And here is the important thing. WHO are you inviting?Are these all people you would have over for dinner? You would tell if you were pregnant? I would try to keep the list small, just immediate family(mother/father grandparents) and best friends if you are wanting a low budget small wedding.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Congratulations!!!!!|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	I have the same dilemma. My in-laws have a large yard so we were thinking of keeping it small. First realize that depending on the chapel, a church wedding can be expensive. Anywhere from a few hundred to a thousand dollars. Also, some officiants want couples to go through counseling sessions, which can also cost extra money. It depends on how big the yard is and how many people are coming if it's still a reasonable number like 50 or 60 and the yard is a decent size, you might want to still consider a backyard wedding. If you have a family minister,  or if you are a member of a church go that route. Generally, officiants like to know weeks or months in advance if you wanted to use the church space.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	If you're looking at a chapel, they probably have their own officiant.  If you have someone in particular in mind the chapel may charge you a fee to use your own officiant or prohibit it entirely.  If you're using your home church, then your minister will likely perform it for a gratuity. <br>  <br>  I enjoy performing ceremonies in people's back yards, parks, the beach... there's something about being outdoors, in the open air, when people 'publicly' declare their commitment... it can be very romantic. <br>  <br>  Congrats & best of luck|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Do what you can afford and be comfortable with.  You determine who is invited, you decide on the size of the wedding. You decide on the place.  It's your day.  Do what best pleases you.|`|2G5K4mLuaa	wedding aT a chapeL is da best..!|`|yFiUxVvfaa	Congrats on your upcoming nuptials! I truly wish you both all the best in your future as husband and wife.  You know...weddings can get out of control rather quickly and costly.  My advice is to do it at home (inside/outside) because you are going to save money instead of having to pay the Chapel their fee.  For something so intimate I would keep it immediate family, very close friends or whomever you feel you absolutely need to have their to witness your nuptials.  They have everyone else at the reception.  You can rent Chivary chairs or wooden chairs (whatever color).

Once his name is on the certificate - he has the right to an original copy of the birth record and you two can work this out w/o a  lawyer.  I would still write down the arrangement on paper with a witness and notary.  And, if you need to make changes do so peacefully.  <br>  <br>  If you are both civil people, you will save yourself a fortune in legal fees.  Hopefully, you both love the child and will put her interests above your own emotional needs.  --- Sounds like you are both want to be good parents to me.
bdSm8Mi6aa	yeah there's no question-- but I say get a job doing telemarketing, or secret shopping, &/or volunteer so you can feel a little bit more useful.  You can't go back in time so try to learn from your mistakes and apply them to life right now.|`|I8M5kw5Saa	You made your bed now you have to lie in it.You yourself said YOU made the bad choices not your kids.NO ONE but you need to take care of you.Stop being a welfare hog and get a job and maybe you will feel better about your self.And don't say you cant work there is a man at our local Walmart that has NO LEGS and works and so can you......|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	So, what is your question?|`|JuqxbJ3Daa	Your probably not in their way you just feel that way.

Those are your thought, and probably the kids and parents never felt like that about you at all.  Try positive thinking, and see what happens. Hope it all works out for you.  I  know what it is like to be homeless.  I am at the moment, but thats my problem, and not my families or friends. I still manage to smile and be friendly. **** happens in our lifetime. Deal with it.
bNuuxJv1aa	Yes if you lie that will just make you have more issues with your relationship with your husband. Just tell him that you thought he didn't want to be with you anymore and well you kind of found another guy and you were very upset and confused at the moment that you did stuff with him.|`|hiDky4fcaa	tell him what happened because it would kill you the rest of your life keeping that huge thing from him. but make sure he understands how much you regret doing it.<br>  <br>  ^thats just my opinion<br>  <br>  do what feels right to you|`|Po1QAWTnaa	shall the truth set you free be honest wouldnt you want him to tell you if it were him!!!|`|XqS5DxR9aa	Hell no!!!!!!!!

I don't know how you could live with that on your mind and still have a healthy relationship. You need to tell him, and if ends the relationship, oh well, it doesn't seem like you were too concerned about that when you cheated. It doesn't matter if you got in a huge fight, unless you signed divorce papers you still cheated and he has the right to know about it.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	No. Don't tell him. It'll only cause more hurt and resentment. Just go forward and try harder to make your marriage work.

What does this tell you about your relationship? Obviously these guys are driving you up the wall. I'd distance from them slowly. If you really want them as friends, then don't cancel your plans every time that they want you to, because it'll show them you have your own life, same as them, and it'll make them realise how much they need you because they haven't got you (unless they don't want you, in which case they are bad friends anyway). If they ask why you bailed on them, say that friendship is a reciprocal thing (means give-and-take) and you feel like you've given too much and gotten too little recently.<br>  <br>  But seriously, you want to broaden your circle of friends, so you have some others to fall back on (don't make them feel like they're second-best though). Go on this holiday, but if they really aren't your friends they'll probably prank you and no one else, so be prepared. If they prank everyone, then laugh - if it's just you, it's not fair.
gT1Ger8faa	No because you've gotten her hopes up and you wouldn't wanna let her down.....|`|DqYNiOjGaa	leave her own ways

You can forgive something that has happened but if something happened that caused a different change in life... sometimes a simple forgiveness can't change everything back, you know?<br>  <br>  If it's the kind of thing where people can try and ease back into something from before, maybe, if it's what everyone wants.  If you don't feel comfortable letting them back in, you don't have to.<br>  <br>  You can do whatever you want, however you want, whenever you want.  You have forgiven them.  That is done with but with it, there weren't any attachments of a package that comes with forgiving.  So just ask yourself what you want and communicate to them what you would like to have happen.  You don't need to provide all the answers for why you decide what you do.  It's not all about them and their feelings... it's about you too and those can be private.<br>  <br>  Anyways... I hope I was of some help. =)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RWgjnwl9aa	No it doesn't when you forgive someone it's more of a benefit to yourself as part of a healing for you alone your conscience is clear you can't change them it's up to them to want to reconcile but the decision is yours alone forgiveness itself is like getting rid of an anchor that has been holding you down  Good luck to you & also it takes a lot of courage to forgive so be proud of yourself OK

MlQ0GIpoaa	It's funny that men seem to be caught up on the penis thing. What I mean is that men would be far more forgiving if their girlfriend cheated with another girl, rather than with a guy. To be honest, I'm not sure how I'd feel about my girlfriend cheating with another girl either, but I know there'd be hell to pay if she cheated with a guy.<br>  <br>  Girls on the other hand would have a harder time with it.<br>  <br>  Edit: Thinking about it; if I were serious about the woman, and had long term goals with her, her cheating with another woman would be a deal-breaker, but if the relationship were casual, I'd probably be a lot less bothered. However, if she cheated with a guy and the relationship was casual, it would still be cause to end it.|`|Rj7L1Rc6aa	um yeah?|`|twlqaZSmaa	the question isn't whether or not others consider it cheating... it should be whether or not you feel a betrayal... in my opinion yes, they cheated. but the bigger question is what does that mean for your relationship? say the majority of people think it's not cheating, does that really make a difference on the effect it has on you? some people grow stronger after an affair, some people grow further apart. it's all circumstantial.|`|PNrJS4OKaa	Yes, just because it's the same sex doesn't mean it shouldn't count.<br>  Being in a sexual relationship with someone other than your partner is considered cheating!|`|GmF4iAFXaa	Of course!  Wouldn't it be if a gay person cheated on another gay person or something!?
o1lJg4Qdaa	If you're not ready or don't want to do it for the wrong reason... DON'T DO IT!  I know guys who have waited till they were 25, my boyfriend waited until he was 21 to do it with his first real girlfriend after they had been together a year... so you're ONly 19.<br>  <br>  A lot of people talk the talk, think it is sooo great...but A LOT more people regret it, think they gave it up too quickly, realized they weren't ready for it until years later and become Man H__res because they are soo pissed it didn't go as "planned."  <br>  <br>  If the emotional reason doesn't justify your thought, then think of this:<br>  <br>  There are sooo many diseases .. that people don't even know they have!   The risk of getting her pregnant, remember condoms are only 99% - that I for one, even though I'm 28- am totally not ready for - can you support a child and woman if it came down to it? What are you willing to sacrifice?  Prevent and Plan before you Proceed. ( I just came up with that) <br>  <br>  So with these things in mind, why waste your time on something that is going to be meaningless or mess up your future?  Not to mention, if the smallest of your problems is that your girl can't wait, then that is ripples compared to the aftermath - is your relationship ready to handle it, talk about it, what feelings are involved, will you resent her, what if you guys break up anyway?<br>  <br>  Stay true to yourself and you'll discover that you'll have smaller problems than what your friends are dealing with... Trust me... Love waits... (my boyfriend is still waiting for me and it's been two years!  I know what I'm talking about. Sure, we mess around, but he knows my limit and respects it.)<br>  <br>  Take care of yourself  - no one else will.|`|a462e85e6714bf6d5302f1d9a4596e8daa	If U have faith in God & have high morals,that helps alot,plus if U meet a girl that feels the same way U do,about having sex b4 marriage,that really helps in the waiting! I know it's not easy,but believe me PLEASE,it IS worth waiting!! U would NOT regret it!! & of course neither would ur future wife! Think of her! Good luck 2 U,I know U can do it,U R stronger than U think!|`|gq2te5pSaa	I'm a dude and i'm waiting.<br>  Sex is nothing without love.|`|cb0b5b67d515b1bb2d77526490647ca8aa	Unfortunately, I'm no longer waiting but I wanted to say that men like you (Men who decide to wait AND can admit it) are pretty rare. The only advice that I can give you is to tell you to stay true to yourself. You want to wait? Just wait. There are things that keep you happy right? Instead of thinking about becoming bitter and judging people, keep yourself busy doing those things. Remind yourself of why you want to wait. Reward yourself for not giving in in tempting situations. <br>  <br>  If you're strong in your decision to wait, the girl that you're meant to spend the rest of your life with will also be willing to wait.
LQs1aAgZaa	Just tell her you like her .. <br>  Sounds like she likes you too babe..<br>  If you are best friends it won't feel akward at all ..<br>  Just go for it ..<br>  Good luck x|`|tBdceRrPaa	I know how you feel...just gotta spill it out and if she doesn't feel the same then so be it....if she is what she is claiming to be "best friends" then this wont affect anything because she already cares for you obviously....so worst case scenario you end up exactly where you are now.....best case.....you have a new gf.....but you definitely should not continue under the guise of "just friends" if you do in fact want something more. get it out there and be honest. i went through the same thing about a month ago...started as friends...i tried to make it more...got rejected...still friends...ended where i started.|`|e9dHHGCSaa	I think she really likes you, considering she spent the night at your house. I think she sees you as a really good friend, and quite possibly more than that. I'd ask her about her feelings for you, and then based on said response, tell her yours.|`|4GnA33s3aa	Ask if she likes you and if she does then ask her if you want to go on a date. I did that once and here I am dating a guy. If she starts to go away just tell her that you were just wounding ok.

The longer you put it off, the worse it will be for his feelings. We as women always feel like we need some kind of excuse to break up with someone. But I guarantee you if the shoe was on the other foot, the guy would just tell you. You dont necessarily have to tell him that you like someone else, just tell him that you dont feel the same way anymore. Just be honest. He might be upset, but he will respect your honesty.|`|TF9hZZxYaa	Lol, same old story<br>  <br>  look i will tell u what happens, u wil leave the guy u are going out with now... whatever u will do or say he will get hurt angry and sad for 3 month...after that he will stay angry with u only and he will despise u.<br>  <br>  u will go out with the new guy for 3 month u will be very happy u will make love to him anything he wants and after that he will dump u  cos he will get bored from u since u like him too much and he will search for a more challenging love.<br>  <br>  After that u will have the idea of going back to ur original bf he may accept and take advantage of ur situation to make sex with u and as soon as he will find another girl he will dump u as hard as u did with him the first time and u will be the only looser of all this game.<br>  <br>  <br>  my advice for is to stay with the original guy who loves u... unless he doesnt <br>  <br>  its ur call now<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|EdQfe0k3aa	im not a guy, but maybe this will work?<br>  tell him your' a lesbian.. you love him lots, but cant pretend anymore..<br>  <br>  lol<br>  jokes..<br>  <br>  but really, either way.. there is gonna be some hurt.. so you not gonna get off this one lightly.. but what hurts the most is when you stretch it out.. he deserves to know how you feel... so just tell him..|`|jjpwYLeuaa	haha ...you just got more proactive and trying to experiment .Try and mantain the distance from old boyfriend and don't ever give a goodbye gift to a guy.|`|QB9szNYMaa	Hand him a million dollars, break the news to him, and sleep with him one last time.|`|0xGtNdveaa	Thats like asking to change an apple to an orange, impossible.

7uTFVEyDaa	I believe that the real reason why you miss the other one is because you have unresolved issues. There is nothing wrong with that, we normally feel something unusual when there are issues that we haven't settled in the past.<br>  <br>  I suggest you talk to that person and clear things up with him. Tell him that the past doesn't matter to you anymore and that you're happy with someone else.|`|gFHzuIrUaa	well maybe you should text the other guy and tell him you like him and he doesn't have to act funny around you, that way your telling HIM you like him and not a friend.

As you how you can be sure you love someone - I have found that I know my oh better than all my ex's as we talk more! He is worth waiting for and although things are not always easy what I have with him is worth every thing|`|i2Q8BOlbaa	I'm in the same predicament and its kind of new. You just have to communicate more than you would if the person where closer to you. Always say what you feel because the person is not present to see your emotions or tell when you're upset or hurting. Never brush little things off. It might eat at you and he isn't there to see that. (Start of drifting apart)<br>  <br>  Generally, he is feeding off of anything you TELL him, not SHOW because he can't see you. Also you have to try and meet up at least once a month or you might loose interest. You need to be physical or you will satisfy yourself elsewhere eventually. Hence cheating.<br>  Hope this helps a little. Goodluck.|`|DRXO3aqaaa	I have been in to many long distance relationships 3 to be exact and you know what its not easy it didnt work for me but also the women were not my type either.|`|Buzxcv0laa	makes no difference to me. i have always known when one i have a connection with wants contact...and if that connection is truly there, things align very quickly after doubts between you are met...|`|I4RnWDqUaa	solution: Internet|`|J8prSTWgaa	can't there... it's all a matter of trust!|`|tEldNDd2aa	I'm 125 miles away from my boyfriend right now and we make a habit of texting good morning to each other every morning and talking on skype every night.

AA10631515	Stick with doing the things you're good at (the singing & stand-up), the things that make you feel confident, and possibly try to develop these into a full-time occupation which gets you some income (nothing is more attractive to a woman than a successful man, so if you can be seen as being successful at what you do, then this should help (also with the money problem).  <br>  As to conversation starters .... I always think a good way is to ask someone for their help or advice - as a woman I find it very flattering when a man asks for my advice & really listens to my answer!!!  It could be something as simple as asking for fashion advice (even if you don't really need it!) e.g. "do you think this style/colour of shirt suits me?" The benefit of this is that it gets her to notice you and makes the conversation personal right away.  You can then follow-up naturally with a compliment about her appearance.  (ladies love compliments about their looks!) Good Luck!|`|AA11537569	First of all don't mention that you have no money.  That might be a turn off.  Sounds like you need to get a job that pays you in cash, I know a lot of people that do that.  Because you need to eat to stay healthy if you want to ask women out on dates.  And also slow down on the karaoke nights, so you will have some money to take a woman out.  Well, if you follow those simple guidelines, you should be on your way.  Good luck!

Some people might be okay with their partner saying "I just don't want to be alone." And a majority of people will be content and happy if someone said "Because I love you." I could easily say that A seems like the most reasonable answer, but then I would have to ask "Does the person really have those feeling for the other or are they just saying that instead of saying B." But it's just my opinion though. But I guess whatever suits you is best.|`|AA11400648	A, of course, because when your partner gets over B, then he won't want you in his or her life anymore.

656e831b1e3ee35a91b1b9082a44f35daa	You are only in the ninth grade! You are not in love yet. Infatuation, yes. Love, no.<br>  <br>  I think you're a bit too carried away with this whole first kiss thing for her. Because from what I read, you two don't even know each other all that well, and from her body language (listening and playing games on the iPOD), she doesn't like you at this very moment. If she was interested in you, she wouldn't be playing games, because that just shows that she's more into looking and focusing on the iPOD rather than you. <br>  <br>  But you could start a conversation with her, because obviously she's bored that's why she's playing games (and besides, those games suck, so I don't think she's having much fun anyways), so when you talk to her, I highly doubt she'd think of you as the annoying kid.  Just start out lightly and be formal when you talk to her, and slowly you two will get to know each other and THEN you can maybe start confessing  your feelings to her. <br>  <br>  G'luck. ;)|`|1ea7db92bddc82e18ccf67f43c867399aa	you could go up to her and just sit beside her to see what song she is listening to, and just watch her play.|`|759cb0f38a86177e9fa9f47e41b6331faa	Just talk to her DONT rush into things, be FRIENDS first before anything else happens at all. rushing into things is never a good idea.|`|AA11543063	why don't you ask her on the buus or when she is less busy|`|bebefaf34a6c0ac4b567ff1ca1e95f37aa	maybe you could pass her a note|`|xD1HdUw9aa	start by talking to her like simple subjects

P9XxUAjhaa	The only guy I was ever with that wasn't circumsized was sort of on the small side, so yeah it was different as in...  I didn't get mine!  lol...  But really, when a guy is erect it is pretty much the same either way.  In fact, a guy who is not circumsized will have a slight tilt at the tip where the skin is attached to the shaft.  That, if the guy is fully proportioned, could actually be to your advantage.  <br>  <br>  While I prefer circumsized guys, I tend to think the "it's icky", "Ant Eater" or any other thoughts about guys who aren't cut are a socially embedded false sense of truth.

Those bad times is what makes us realize the good memories and experiences we have.

My church is not typical.  It's a korean church with a Vietnamese pastor that's only 23 years old.  We're modern and totally not legalistic. The only thing we say about Christianity for ourselves is: God loves everyone because they're his children.  And also, we are a family with unconditional love.  Love and forgiveness no matter what.  Corny, huh?  But they're my family.<br>  <br>  Putting on a brave face is never easy, but sometimes you don't have to.  Look to your true friends and if they can't accept you for who you are, they aren't your true friends.  Also, remember there are probably millions of others who have it worse than you do.. starving of love as well as hunger.  You sound like a nice person, so make others see it too! <br>  <br>  I hope you feel better soon.|`|gP3BSp7Iaa	You are so right! When our heart is hurting and we feel rejected it does feel like we are all alone.  When I feel like that it doesn't seem to matter how many times I talk about --- I feel just as bad. I think this is because we have invested all of ourselves into this other person and we can't understand why they don't love us enough to want to continue the relationship. Unfortunately nothing seems to help except time and moving on to new relationships. The more new memories you make with somone else the less the old memories hurt. I hope you are feeling better soon.|`|potzUKGGaa	i had this happen when i lost my cat (which acted as though i was its mom and i acted as though it was my son)Mac.I was in denial but i got through with it after a year or two.I still start crying when i tell the  story or when i think about him.*cries* :`(

butwmSpnaa	Hola! Me parece q no solo la confianza se ha perdido, sino tambien el respeto. Pienso q en el noviazgo se ven los rasgos de la verdadera personalidad de la persona, no es q el ya no existe es q esta aflorando actitudes de el q no conocias. Pienso q tienes dos opciones: * puedes seguir con el pero deberian ser guiados por algun tipo de consejero o psicologo, o asistir a algun grupo para novios en tu iglesia algo q los pueda guiar. o * si no tienen una oportunidad de ser guiados creo q es mejor q se separen al menos un tiempo para q ambos recapaciten y tomen en consideracion q tanto les importa la relacion. No pueden seguir perdiendo el tiempo y mucho menos seguir lastimandose.

You're right though, it does sound like you are being used.. that whole experience for high school crap, you shouldnt have to be the person he tries things out on just to learn from. You should find someone to be with who actually cares about you! And about Monday, well you might cry, but maybe then you will find out the truth. Crying at school might be kinda hard, but you will have friends there to comfort you and then your boyfriend can feel bad because he made you cry in the first place.<br>  He should learn a lesson.<br>  Good luck hun!|`|GXJOy8YBaa	dump him. he probably didnt get his cell tooken away. but dont always listen to your best friends. i listened to mine. and it didnt work out.|`|Gxa7ajKAaa	Get rid of him.<br>  Hes just using you.<br>  And like the other guy said.<br>  If you give him "expierence" for high shcool you'll just be another pregnacy statistic.<br>  So like i said.<br>  get rid of him<br>  and dont take him back.|`|PwGbRvqBaa	you should talk to him personally, even if it means you have to do it in school. There's no problem if you cry about it. if it is true, then you can  break up with him.if he asks for another chance, it's up to you if you'll give it to him.|`|UbG5L7gjaa	you<br>  are<br>  so<br>  ******<br>  dumb<br>  dude<br>  idont even know what to say to you|`|kzw9SDIDaa	hai..i think he is using u cozz ur feeling USED...<br>  if u can't talk with him.., just email him..<br>  don have relationship with anyone if u feel being CHEATED...<br>  trust me..i h've experecience with my ex-gf,,she used me toooo|`|tqqmkf7iaa	I would dump him and make him look like an *** infront off everyone..
4a4a9e278b4069ea1f619947b4aceafbaa	I'm almost sure she does. Most of women like to touch for a long time somebody they like, in order to keep his body odour on their hands. It's also a way to insinuate that she wants you to make a step further. Go on!!|`|olMoJiYmaa	yeah probably..unless there's something wrong with you and you're like her special buddy|`|0qMd3QZBaa	k obviously yes. well maybe..... if she does that with a lot of other guys,that's just her being her. i know this girl who will do all the things you mentioned to me, but she'll turn around and do it to someone else. some girls are just naturally flirty. so observe her with other guys and if she doesn't do it to them then she likes you.|`|0WZqlcOwaa	I think she definitely likes you, it's pretty obvious...|`|CeJ9ZD0Raa	A girl who tries to get close to a guy like that is definitely flirting and making a move.|`|FHygp5Zuaa	Oh yeah she likes you for sure.

But i do admit, by telling her how u feel ur relationship might be at risk  however, this clearly proves she likes but u should try ..give her hints too ...it looks like she started , and u will never knoe if u dont try . by the way if u guys have a solid friendship if you told her she would understand|`|TRFnLsixaa	aww i think shes into  ya hun.Give her a try.Ask her out.I think theres a like 90% chance shell say yes.From the way yall have been acting,i think shell say yes!Maybe shes waiting for the guy to ask.Alot of girls do that. :)|`|g9v1qSUFaa	if you cant figure this one out on your own, you got a problem lol. shes showing alot of interest in you and feels comfortable around you. she definitely likes you.

AA11292270	Divorce is very difficult even when it is for the best. <br>  <br>  Healing takes time.  The people I know who have done the best after a divorce are people who don't hide from the pain by rushing into new relationships right away.  Instead, they take some time for themselves, allow themselves some peace and quiet, and take a long, hard and honest look at what part they played in their marriage ending.  It seems that people who don't do this simply repeat the same mistakes in their next relationship...and things that were painful the first time around are not easier the second time.<br>  <br>  If you do it right, it will be at least a year, probably two, before you will feel a whole lot better.  But then you can really move on as opposed to setting yourself up for another failure.|`|JhXUzeIGaa	i knew fo rsure my husband was going to leave me. i mean i was positive. i was "emotionally prepared" but when it actually happened it hit me in ways i couldnt even begin to cope with. its going to be hard. really hard. but you just have to remember that no matter what the sun is going to come up in the morning and the moon is going to go down at night. the days are going to pass. whether you like it or not. whether you decide to live them or not. there for just try and be happy. try and make it through and live them happy because you have to live the days either way. its going to hurt more than not. and i cant really say anything else because im still going through the pain right now. but just know that you are not alone. alot of people are going through it and alot of people get through it. so we should be able to too. thats what makes me try a little harder even though it hurts. if they are the ones leaving then hey! their loss. |`|XFGFZPueaa	Sorry to hear about your problems.  I dealt with the same.  It took me about 4-6 weeks to start sleeping again normally after everything went down (mine was kind of sudden).  I could not sleep at all for 2 weeks,  That was almost 2 years ago.  <br>  <br>  After that, I got some clarity and made a push for my daughter and actually got custody of her, so everything else has been pretty immaterial since.    <br>  <br>  Given that you have kids involved, is there any way you can work on things.  I have hated putting my daughter through this and she deserves so much better.  I think with me, we got so involved with life and work that we never had any time for each other.  If I were to ever get married again, I would insist that we budget some time for each other on a regular basis.  It might be a date night or just put on some music, open up a beer and talk about your week.  There is a reason why you got each other in the first place - maybe you can find that again?  Good luck.  <br>  |`|YSaQydWIaa	There is no preparing for it. It will hit and hit you hard even knowing it is coming. It takes people different amounts of time to get over a divorce. If you still love her, it will depend on how long YOU let it take you to get over it. Take some time to mourn her, then try and move past it.<br>  |`|GaIg5A8Zaa	any way you can. it's diffrent for everyone.
t2sTqzu9aa	Well first, I would address the fact that your parents don't accept it. Tell them that this is who and what you are and if they don't like it, they are gonna have to live with it or stay away from you.<br>  <br>  Wouldn't you just go to a gay club or bar to find men?|`|e9dHHGCSaa	I'd put this in the appropriate section, otherwise you are bound to get nasty responses from 13 year old boys.<br>  <br>  As for your question, you may have to wait until you move out.|`|7mxCMfYKaa	Sexual preference I would say does definitely let you choose to be a true follower of Christ though. Knowing the Bible condemns the act. So voluntarily sinning your whole life and expecting to goto heaven? Sin is sin and doesn't get into heaven. One who loves God will follow ALL His commandments. I personally don't have anything against people of any sexual preference I treat them the same although I disagree with it. I don't really think I can answer your question though..|`|e4Xd9zL5aa	You could look on craigslist in the gay personals section or go to gay clubs. I would suggest to just never bring guys home, eventually you will move out and be able to live your own life. If the your partner asks why you never go to your house, be honest and say your parents are unaccepting of you being gay, they will understand. Always use protection and be safe. Goodluck|`|S262cpAXaa	Your the one that gay so tell your perents to get ****** it's your life not theirs I'm not professional I mean I'm 14 but even I wouldn't take **** from my perents I like boys and I a girl but I no what I'm talking about|`|rAvZ9yGcaa	Ah, I hate how people feel about gays and Christianity.  The Bible is against it, but seriously, a person should never be turned down by Religion.  I'm sorry your parents feel that way.<br>  <br>  I can't pin point a place for gay men to meet because, well, I'm not one.  An obvious one to me is a gay bar, but that would be...  strange.  Bars aren't the greatest places to meet people.  I would say look around in college.  By then your parents have no say because you're an adult.  You're already old enough to decide on your own.  I'd also, personally, move out and room with someone else in an apartment.  But for meeting people, someone else will have to give you an answer to that one.
LRffWATSaa	First, I just want to say you're gorgeous.<br>  <br>  To answer your question though, first thing you notice is gonna be looks, but that will only get you so far.<br>  <br>  For me to stay with a girl, she must have a fun personality, be willing to try new things, and have fun.|`|uIW16Rf8aa	i think your pretty and not trying to hard <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuPlnfuIsDM4afhhEqMxeI3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307020553AABN0SP">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|H9G8y1acaa	Honesty|`|uiJTMSw2aa	WoW<br>  Absolutely gorgeous!!|`|ZTyAfwiMaa	first things i notice is the eyes and her face...these parts always tell the "truth" about a girl....and mostly not being a slut...9/10|`|5NEuETLDaa	YOUR CHEST BUTT WAT UR HOBBIES R LOOKS MOVES AND VIP PERSONALLITY AND THEY HATE GIRLS WHO SHOW OFF THE BODY TOO MUCH|`|b0Q6ecqzaa	you're trying too hard.<br>  <br>  aside from underarm hair, nothing is more of a turn off.|`|dNWtLxPlaa	Do Not ask in places like this you will only get answers from idiots.|`|n0UBhV2jaa	She's cute. But she's one of those Asians that try too hard. Well that's what she seems like.<br>  And you can tell she thinks she's hot.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Those sexy legs like on the girl in the picture.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Trying too hard, you look easy.|`|DyPVKQg6aa	The first impression is always her looks. I like a girl with a good set of full lips, but not too big; fit body, not too skinny and not fat, but a little chub i suppose is ok if she has other things to make up for it; of course the size of boobs and butt; how tall she is, not too tall but not midget either, but i suppose heigth isnt a huge issue; long, luscious legs, style/color of hair; her face, if its clear or not, but I can get past a little acne; and most of all I look at her eyes. The eyes are, to me, one of the most beautiful assets a girl can have. My favorite color on any kind of color girl is emerald/saphire green, but i have preferences for different colored hair. If she is blonde then I prefer green or root beer brown, but if not then the traditional blue is ok. If she's brunette then I love blue eyes on a brunette if they dont have green, and if the girl has a little bit of a tan then that makes the blue just pop. Not a fan of redheads persay, but green.<br>  Then after that I get to know her and she has to have a fun, and out going personality. She must obtain confidence, because no guy likes a timid girl who hates who she is or how she looks. Then she must know how to like or even love a guy, and each girl is different with those.<br>  <br>  The pictures are great!! You don't find many young asian girls who are as gorgeous as you. Plus, your lips are full, your hair is a pretty color and styled nicely, and your eyes are beautiful; they really compliment your skin and hair colors.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	Beauty, nice straight legs, nice character and good communication skill|`|04d6651ebec3cf813f57a13eb4a152bbaa	honesty, brains, personality, and beauty<br>  <br>  she is very pretty, but dresses kinda skanky|`|mDBHMJPjaa	there both GREAT!! the first one is good for a party..<br>  yellow dress is better for a date :)

Slip a cute card in her locker with a movie pass, and tell her you have the other one---wanna go?<br>  Either she'll rip you off or go with you. Best to know these things ahead of time.|`|tEtYO6PPaa	Aw, just tell her. <br>  Put yourself in her shoes - if someone you liked told you that they liked you, that wouldn't be bad. You would feel flattered and want to pursue them. :)|`|rAvZ9yGcaa	Just do it.  =)<br>  <br>  If you don't do it, who will?<br>  <br>  My Personal Favorite Quote:  "A journey of 1000 miles starts with a single step."|`|N0N9FzEhaa	You CANT GET THIS GIRL OUTTA MY HEAD or OFF YOUR HEAD/FACE??|`|FH8I3kpFaa	You need to tell her before someone else does. Look at it this way, if she reacts positively, then hey you have a new girlfriend and if it does not work out so well, you know that you did not waste time with her and you can move on. Just make sure the time is right, like after you guys had a great moment or your hanging out alone. I'm sure she will be flattered (:|`|f2V3eZj6aa	next time she invites you out accept the invite (or ask her out) and then lay down how you feel. it may be easier to say it in email or text but its much wimpier. do it in person.|`|n0UBhV2jaa	Just tell her. :)<br>  Or write her a letter/email and see her response.<br>  But also say if she doesn't feel the same way - you's can just stay friends. :D
iPNOVR6Gaa	Tell him, "If you want it done, go do it."  Say it in a very blah voice, and make it your automatic response.  Repeat it over and over, whenever he nags.  And if that doesn't work, just say no.  "No, I'm not going to do that."  Be firm.  An angry tone of voice is not necessary, but, as an adult in your house, you are allowed to say no.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Tomorrow when he begins nagging about the unfinished housework, agree with him. That will surprise him. Then tell him you are going to call and get some maid service over to help you. Tell him the cost will be worth not hearing him complain because you are doing the best you can with 2 kids and a part-time job. Then smile.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	The problem is that you don't think the things he is upset about matter. You better start listening to your husband. I promise you won't die if you stop leaving teaspoons in the sink and fold the laundry and put it away. He seems pretty easy to please.   Do the housework, and then play with the kids. Work before pleasure...always.|`|gfHutvEFaa	Explain to him that you are completly aware of his feelings and are agreeing with him. Tell you agree 100% that the house should sparkle, then hand him the bucket, soap, cleaner, bleach, gloves and tell him to "have at it". <br>  <br>  Also, tell him if he wanted a "mother" then he sould have never left home.|`|R0U4qy6haa	get the house cleaned up instead of being on here woman|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	An option you haven't mentioned is to run a "perfect" house, look after the children and give up your business. What your husband does not recognise is that it is better to have happy, healthy children and a happy wife than a pristine house. What you actually do probably do is work more than full time hours if you totted it all up but men somehow manage to forget that household chores and looking after children is also "work" but of the unpaid variety. Working at your business for about 30 hours a week is almost full time anyway given that I work full time and my contracted hours are 37 per week.<br>  I grew up in a pristine house but it was not really a happy home. A random thought which may not be practical but what about keeping a diary of what you actually do and how long it takes for a week or a month?<br>  He does need to realise that there are only so many hours in a day and that you need some downtime too.|`|lzooHi0Baa	Just ignore him.  He sounds more like a woman than a man.    A guy like this is either a control freak or gay.   Tell him to hire a maid or shut up.|`|AA10500537	ignore him when he srarts nagging <br>  take the baby and go shopping<br>  turn the tv up loud so you cant hear him <br>  just tell him like it is youlre not perfect and  not his maid|`|5lPIKcOaaa	How about crappy advice, except one, who said he dosnt seem like a hard man to please. I know its frustration cause you think if you do what he's asking, he'll win...  well, that's just pride, isn't it? <br>  Suck it up, I'm sure he'd be fine, if you quit you business and just took care of the kids and the house. I'm sure he would not complain about going to work everyday and working for you and the kids. But you insist on working, so you now have willing, taken onto your plate, a house, mothering and work. Your choice, not your husbands. He deserves a clean house. He deserves a wife and a good mother to his children. <br>  Stop being so arrogant and selfish. It's a house, it's not hard to clean. What means more to you? <br>  Your business/work? <br>  Or your babies and husband? <br>  <br>  I think your husband is trying to tell you something.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Wow, what does he expect super woman?<br>  Running a house and taking care of kids is a hard enough job without someone always after you about something.<br>  Here's what I would do. Set certain days out of the week for chores, like Monday vacuum, Tuesday laundry, and so on. You have certain days and he has certain days. Set certain times up that you spend playing with the kids. Like mommy time, or family time. Sometimes there are so many tasks and things you have to get done, it can be overwhelming. Organizing it can make it a little easier to deal with. <br>  I hope that helped.<br>  Good luck!|`|MvMT8TD3aa	You need to be blunt and say if he has a problem he has to do something. I work 28 hours a week and have to do everything round the house, washing, washin up you name it i do it. When i would ask him for help he would moan at me as im at home during the day so i should do it. We sat down and really really opened up. I said everything i do and he didnt realise, they take it for granted. Good Luck xox|`|lheU07Rcaa	Tell him you'll be happy to make sure every household task is done to a standard of perfection, in addition to raising children, running a business, and giving him top-notch nookie... if he'll support your new amphetamine habit.<br>  <br>  That's kind of a joke, and kind of not, because I'm not aware of the existence of any unassisted Superwomen.<br>  <br>  If you're unwilling to go to such drastic measures to keep up with the laundry... Well, that's where my advice ends, because I've not ever seen the ****** (one who nags... that's an A, not an I) in a relationship change his/her expectations and stop nagging, or seen the naggee in a relationship achieve perfection.  You may just have to agree to disagree.|`|oAv7Mv3raa	I bet its something more then housework. He wants to be the man. Are you making more money then him? If you are then he does not feel like the man of the house and is trying to show his man power.
AA10189093	he just wants to be frnds|`|1ea7db92bddc82e18ccf67f43c867399aa	sounds like his immature version of telling u he likes you. you can either confront him and tell him to stop making fun of you, and he'll probably stop, then u can have an actual relationship, or you can  just let it go on until your breaking point. this happned to me.|`|268f343e1595efa3563450702f5cca7daa	Ignore him until he approaches you.|`|AA10408696	Yeah  what you said,,  exactly like that|`|0737b1e6f763fba1fc2121385c0b0c35aa	SORRY to hear that

AIrPtuDUaa	I think that is a reasonable price especially since they set up, tear down, and the tables come with table linens.  My parents rented tents, tables, and chairs and they spent about this much but the tables didnt come with the linens.  they didnt even have as many chairs as you're going to have or a stage or dance floor. So it's a good price! Congrats!|`|Q3ibC4Rnaa	I almost went with a tent rental and a tent with sides and no dance floor was going to cost over $820 dollars. The places I checked out would come and deliver (let's say you have a Saturday wedding) on Friday or Thursday morning (if you asked) and then break everything done that Monday. Giving you enough time to decorate and do what you need to do. Your quote is average for your size. Though, I do suggest looking around some more. Most places will drive a good amount of miles, so check a little outside of your range too. <br>  <br>  The only reason we changed our minds is because our tent would be set up on grass, and tent floor is VERY costly. We were scared if it rained enough the week before then our tent wouldn't be good enough for our guests, just in case we found something different that cost only $200 more and no worries about what to do in case of bad weather!|`|xuiSfzgraa	I think that is a reasonable price.  I am paying $2300.00 for a tent, side walls and dance floor...But I had to get a HUGE tent to have room for 250+ guest, so the tent alone is $1400.00.   thank goodness I don't have to worry about renting tables and chairs, or I would be over the $3,000.00 mark:)|`|7G4hisdzaa	Well I think that is a deal!  I looked into tents when we thought we were having an outdoor wedding, and the tent alone was $1000, and another $1000 for the floor!!!!!  And that didn't include any chairs or linens.|`|di6p10Ifaa	I think that is a great deal. We were quoted about $350 for just the tent. Our wedding planner who actually owns our venue is providing the food, tables, linens, is doing the decor, chairs, and clean up for like $1200. I think you are getting a good deal!! Make sure they have nice clean tents and durable tables and chairs and clean linens. smart shopper ;)
c264862df8b2b399edca57fa76cb3e94aa	Your husband is an imbecile. But I imagine, since at least two hours have passed since the ceremony ended, you already know that.

Womennn !!!!!|`|AA10037861	Just you <br>  Im soo sorry that happened to you.|`|AA11315816	Honey, you do know how to hold a grudge!  LOL  Let it go - it's been 10 years already.  He had to pay for the wedding SOMEHOW!  And even if he didn't pay for the wedding, did you ever stop to think that maybe he was trying to make money to be able to provide for his NEW WIFE?  So he didn't buy you a wedding present; maybe he viewed marrying you as the best gift he could give you.  Or maybe he just didn't have the money to (hence his going to work 2 hours after the wedding).  <br>  <br>  As for your jealousy over his buying his mother a wedding present - give it up!  You are his wife but she is his mother - without her, he wouldn't be here.  On some weird level that he'll never admit to, she'll always be on a higher pedestal than you are.<br>  <br>  No offense to you, this is just the way I see it.  I've had years of experience with things like this.|`|AA11614675	I was the one that went to work. My hubby went home with the kids.|`|a2a81a556cd364639ff2a9f80608c164aa	He sounds like a workaholic.  My husband is the same way.  He would rather work, vacuum, do the laundry, than spend anytime with me.  Do not let your husband put his work before you.  I made this mistake and I am lonely as hell.  We've been married for 13 yrs now and I know he will never change.  He did spend our honeymoon together, but no other 'dates' since then. Good luck|`|d852c88da8e0994aa3e8a3c6781dc3c0aa	just you.. we took a honeymoon to St. Barts.. sorry..|`|aa09942cef582cd12b1b2b8c5b5330b7aa	OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That happened to me too, I'm 20 me and my husband just got married a few months ago. We're both in the Army, he's Infantry and after we got married he had to go back to work, I was kinda sad because I was on leave from Iraq, but then again I knew what I was getting into before I married him, and I love my husband very much, so its okay.|`|d8ad1f9bf096cecee2eaa6a40ff04443aa	It is not the ideal situation to have BUT...<br>  <br>  He now has a family to think of and responsibilities of a wife and eventual kids.  Maybe he takes that seriously.<br>  <br>  Be glad he has a job and WANTS to work hard for you.<br>  <br>  BUT - schedule some honeymoon time and do not let him take any calls from work or even THINK of work!  Good Luck!|`|ce53a9f68093b2a6cf60a521947320d0aa	nope sorry cant say that happened to me, he took the whole week off after to go on a honeymoon..|`|AA12029217	Well if you guys are happy now, why does it still bug you?

1ea7db92bddc82e18ccf67f43c867399aa	ummmm..... i'm trying to figure out this scenario. why did you tell her to just let her food be? but it seems like she does. by sticking her toungue out and eating slowly (even if she always does this when you're around) she's probably just trying to get you to look at her mouth.|`|e346637c1293d12cfa3e73b9a7ea7d4baa	maybe she was really hungry; the food she was eating was spicy, theres a chance she might like you....

ea053a21443b3b6de2f7175812b6ac91aa	You can fall in love easy in your early twenties, but it might be just the first chance you have to have a serious relationship, and your finances are bound to be weak unless your parents are wealthy.<br>  <br>  So American/Modern Western culture has evolved into one where you are likely to have a 3-5 year relationship instead of a lifelong marriage or a 20 year marriage ending in divorce.   <br>  <br>  My parents were divorced after 18 years of marriage, I think they could have known it wasn't for them after 3-6 years if they didn't think their lives would be failures if they broke up.   People are just more ready nowadays to recognize that and take the chance of finding something in their thirties.  <br>  <br>  So people say, 'The thirties are the new twenties'.  And all the people in their twenties say, 'American culture hates youth'.   And the beatles sing, 'You've got to pay your dues if you want to sing the blues, and you know it don't come easy'.   And David Byrne sings 'Same as it's ever been.'<br>  <br>  What culture isn't doing is letting the hook off of people in their twenties for not having their lives solved.  The preceding generations sit and fret and worry and think their children and grandchildren aren't doing well, when they should be allowed to be happy go lucky for a while, WITHOUT remorse.   This should be a payoff of the 'peace dividend', that America is better and so we get to have better lives.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunatly, power in America is held by people who need Wal Mart clerks and church members and oil, so instead of this we get to go to Iraq or go into the 'service sector'.  <br>  <br>  This might seem off the subject, but it is the backdrop for the whole scene of people dating in their thirties.   <br>  <br>  People are more picky now.  Watch sex in the city, women might just 'not be that into you', generally they aren't.  The short women are holding out for tall men.  Everybody wants the right size of person.  Everybody wants a mate with good hair and a good job and a good car and no social anxieties and who gets along with their friends and who dances but isn't too gay about it.   <br>  <br>  And single men in their thirties are more likely to be out in middle america holding down forts and making society work, while unmarried liberated cool single women tend to leave middle America for sophisticated jobs in the big city.   Where they then complain there aren't enough men, and then talk about how guys who don't live in the big city don't have an 'edge' or something.   (and if they do get an edge in the small city, to impress big city women, the small city women think they are gay because they care too much about fashion)<br>  <br>  I like how Esquire puts it, 'Because it has become that harder to be a man.'<br>  <br>  I think in these terms, it has become easier to be a woman.   Which is justified, and it still should have gotten easier.  <br>  <br>  But for that to happen, men have had to change too, which is difficult and we want something in exchange for that effort.  <br>  <br>  So the bottom line is, we're going to be 'just dating' until we see *exactly* what we want.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  There is not an easy answer.|`|33b7005880714f4feefb51e7e95ce6a5aa	I'll sum it up for all men.<br>  <br>  Either GAY or PLAYER.|`|e79e9c71cb2715dbb34d10f849c6ea5aaa	Haven't found the one yet.

Espically Lamb and Lynx are like 13 and they alreasy support Hitler. Aren't they a little to young? I was dissapointed when the dad when custody. Those girls need to leave their racist mom.<br>  That episode sucked|`|87518bd8e2e06f22563253c1aa8c7978aa	That it one scary situation!  It makes me sick to see those girls spreading such hatred.  I'm just glad that they aren;t in public school to spread to kids there age.  Grown people know better and if they choose to believe that or follow that then they are in their rights; but to teach children that!  Her momma needs to be shot!|`|AA10244590	I want to give those two little girls a taste of my caramel stick in front of their mother...Imagine what mom would think about their two little girls doing a manage-a-trois with a "*****". Yeah!|`|bf77fe546858b60e594976edfb1ed6b9aa	I feel sorry for those girls.  Hopefully when they grow up, they will be exposed to more of the real world, and learn to get along with everyone.  Scary, how our parents warped beliefs so easily become our own.

That will teach her!|`|32e522b2a5d05abbedcd9a09989b51a2aa	Well, you're not until you stop dwelling on it. But, he is just an ex not a husband. Stay cool and be friends with her. Be there when she needed somebody to talk to.  Always be there for her.  On the other hand, if you really want to get over this girl, find somebody else. Don't dwell on this one.|`|AA11137163	Well think of it as not getting over her but having fun while you wait. I was totally in love with this guy when i was 14 years old and held a flame for him for years.. we just stayed friends and i watched him go through a string of girlfriends and even a wife. While i waited i had boyfriends and even got married myself at one stage , i even fell in love with a few men here and there. Now after 18 years (that sounds along time but im only 32) we are finally together and he cant believe it took us so long. (men!!!) Now we are still going strong and we laugh about all the stupid choices we made before we chose each other. And we have love as well as history..|`|add8f67d1782afd6718d5b011956f7e8aa	Look around, shes just one of many. There are plenty of girls out there and they are just waiting for a great guy to come along.|`|AA10689222	your momma|`|81926c5943ceef434288e2c31cc52a80aa	Getting over anybody is not an easy task. Just give it time...that is the only thing that will heal your "wounds". I read some of the other answers...and getting with her friend will not help you...you may feel instant gratification...but ultimately it will backfire and you will end up in a worse situation. Time...it's the only method.

Peace!|`|643a7e87744e9491db8457d0989df9a6aa	my son put a bean in his nose once and it got all swollen and i had to take him to the ER to get it taken out,|`|dLnh4v5Haa	I had sinus surgery and they put this packing stuff up my nose. When they pulled it out it made a sucking sound like part of your brain was going to come with it. I had a lot of blood clots fall out afterwards (one as big as a small orange), but no brain tissue fell out- at least not that I am aware of.<br>  P.S. don't go to Target after you get the packing pulled re:<br>  the clot thing. They just fall outta your head unannounced. People don't like that.

I am a woman and if anyone wanted to know AND iI felt it was any of their business,  I would be honest about it. Men are the ones who never come clean about this,.They think that they are immune to scrutiny because of the old double standard thing.|`|AA10275501	guess its the fear of being remembered by your love as a whore?|`|xnKxpje5aa	Not correct. There are actually women out there that have never had a one night stand. This might surprise you, but there are also women out there that have only had sex with one man, the one they are married to. The same viewpoint is still held where women's and men's sexual activities are concerned. If a man sleeps with a lot of women, he is some kind of hero, and considered to be macho. If a woman sleeps with a lot of men she is considered to be a whore! There are women out there that actually do care about their good reputation.
syXz13W2aa	I say ask him to the movies, as long as it's with other friends.  That way you get to hang out with him, but he doesn't feel as if it is a date.

If you think you have trouble turning his head now, a little make up will not change his thoughts towards you.

MOVE ON!|`|93496f1d886da8dde852f44ba2c8cd64aa	if you ask him out for anything else other than friendship, you are setting your self up for is disappointment no matter how he responds. <br>  But if you are set on asking him out, remember be breezy. Ask him an hour before you go with your other friend...make it the least like a date that you can. (if this is the normal practice for you asking your friends to go to a movie with you) Do not make it to be anything else (especially in your heart).

UZLziZi8aa	It's all in your actions. Do cute little things like bringing him stuff, like cookies and candies. At school just buy him some candy or a coke and nicely tell him with a little smile, "here i bought this for you". Or make some cookies the night before at home and take a few in a ziplock bag for him. Things like that will make him feel special and appreciated.  It's the little things that add up to make the big picture. good Luck!|`|zmfDnWHyaa	Okay.  This is my opinion, but...Here goes-<br>  I'd like a girl to hold my hand a lot, give me hugs, and just be excited to see me every time we get together.

I always feel like that's the guys job, but it's really not :D|`|1ea7db92bddc82e18ccf67f43c867399aa	how about since you're already going out, then just tell him. it doesn't matter how young you are, you should talk a lot anyways. if you're not the kind of person to say it out loud, say it in your actions. do something thoughtful for him, just something so that he'll know.
6ELSwKKvaa	When I sent flowers I like to mix it up. I have sent roses but then I also have gone into the florist and just asked them what would be attractive and impressive. They are pretty good about putting together a nice display. I like sending flowers to my husband at work because he works with all women and they get jealous when my hubby gets flowers. LOL<br>  <br>  Also, my husband likes flowers more than me. I see flowers for myself and think "He could have just given me the money and I would have gotten a haircut or massage!" LOL|`|ByUS0k8waa	Its just what they like. He normally buys me roses and sometimes what he likes but they all mean something special. Its just up to you and what he likes.|`|QCmRRbABaa	I use to send  red roses.

Put them in a vase.. no wait.. my boyfriend doesn't even own a vase. Flowers in a... drinking glass.<br>  <br>  Really, flowers are more of a gift for women. If you want to 'send' him a gift, why not send him something like cookies from a gourmet shop. With that said though, why do you need to 'send' him anything. Show up on your next visit with a bottle of wine you can share, or make cookies for him.. or any type of food he likes.

I don't think it really matters what kind of flowers; besides, if your man is so into flowers, you should know what his favorite flower is. Most men think flowers are just gay.

AA11789965	She might just be shy and kinda like you, or she just wants to be friends. It really could go either way. Best thing to do is to act normal and relaxed and see how things go from there. But also be assertive. Be the one to engage in conversation, and casually ask to do something again.<br>  <br>  The biggest problem we have is we think there is some sort of universal thing that all girls do when they like a guy or when they just wanna be friends. There can be some hints towards one thing or another, but there's really just one way to tell, and that is to ask her out.|`|31fb368cfb87dfdb5736c1298cf56098aa	She's just trying to be polite.Chances are when the time comes for you to visit she'll already have plans.

AA12004880	I'm sure she does want to kiss you.. You just need to calm down! My boyfriend does this frequently, actually. He always tells me that he doesn't feel I really ever want to kiss him, and then he goes off on a tyrade of questions as to how he could be better and if something is wrong with him. To be honest: The stressing is far more annoying.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you're not a bad kisser. Girls have a nasty tendancy to dump someone as soon as they feel they're a bad kisser. And you're not dumped! So calm yourself, and just keep your cool.|`|1ea7db92bddc82e18ccf67f43c867399aa	it may not be that she doesn't wanna kiss you. it could just be that she's nervous or she thinks that she isn't the good kisser.|`|AA10879690	play with her tongue while kissing her, that'll turn her on. if not while kissing just curress her body!|`|7532035b5814c446a2ae6b23cc1f6519aa	Dude, you are stressing way too much.

Also keep the slobber to a minimum.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11572165	practice makes perfect...just a tip..don't always have your tongue in her mouth..soft kisses are great.|`|a692bec8605df1de5051c4ffe3d7a68aaa	Once I had a girlfriend that I wasnt physically attracted to and I hated to kiss her but I liked her personality because she was an awesome girl plus she was great in bed.|`|01bc5619907bde7e984808b702dd8773aa	you should try asking her instead of us. who else better to know right?|`|7SDSpqVZaa	its all come from experience, if you have like 6 ex gf like I does before I'm sure you capable to do anything, beleive me.|`|AA10256653	C'MON MAN; YOU ARE THERE TO COMFORT & PROTECT HER ; BE HER SHIELD.......

qystdBf2aa	OKay.... so... my opinion...<br>  <br>  I'm going to sound like a total old lady saying this, but I swear, it's from experience. <br>  <br>  I'm fourteen too, and fourteen is just a really risky age to date. It wrecks things, badly. You get way too cought up in emotions and physical attractions and other things... you can go to far and not realize until it's too late...<br>  <br>  But if you really like her that much where you're going to risk it, then go for it, I suppose. If she said she'd dance with you she may like you- but don't get cocky and don't do stupid things like making her jealous or testing her, etc. It's a major turnoff.|`|kbc7PZgnaa	dont be a wussy about it just dance with her i kno wut u meen tho i remember the first time i danced with the girl  i liked it was hard but very enjoyable|`|uCwaF28haa	Yay 8th grade! Tell her you like her. Do it. There are only a few days left right? What have you got to lose? If she says she hates your guts (doubtful) then you have the whole summer to collect yourself. If you think you have a chance, go for it! Don't over compliment her though, that gets annoying FAST. Work up your confidence level before going to the dance (like wear your favorite "fancy" shirt or something) and don't forget deoderant. Other than that, you should be golden! Good luck!

1816a64fd088fbedf36f65a5fd54e4a0aa	I think that you can see potential for love on the phone. It is a great opportunity to learn about the person from the "inside, out".  I do believe that there is a VERY important thing called chemistry and to find out if that is really there you need to both be there in person. It is a real "chemistry"...we respond to different people differently when they are in our close physical presence, from everything from facial expressions, scents, small gestures...how it feels when we hug or lightly touch them even!  It's a good start, but I've talked to someone on the phone for months and months..thought I was falling in love, then we met........and NO WAY! It didn't have anything to do with looks, it was that "chemistry thing".....weird but true. I wonder what other people will say.|`|ad29ae1e4579367f70ee724b47d93459aa	no...go out(IN PERSON) atleast a few times first|`|e8834c2dedea6fc37c533a9cfa3b8b62aa	yes of course its possible|`|fad9edb37d505b9e248d63f7c83e3976aa	Maybe infatuation I think.

a7b65cff8b4db4751b97b1fb644f3a80aa	Divorce is so high because instead of trying to work out your problems, it is easier to run away.  The grass is not greener...it is burnt!  Unless there is physical or emotional abuse, married couples should try and work through their differences and face the fact that a good marriage is work!

Trust is special thing that many don't take care about as long as they can get by with it. It seems to be a trend to cheat now-a-days. But it shouldn't be. Morals just seem to be going down hill. Movies, tv, everything is out there everywhere and offered freely. And too many people seek out the things they really don't need in their lives that tempt them and entice them to do wrong toward their partners. People don't stay away from temptation. The bible says- do not tempt the devil. Do not tempt fate.|`|kWmQ7hJ4aa	Too many prostitutes!|`|rqKeuubnaa	There are many reasons as to why divorce is so high. As to why it is high in sweden, that I cannot answer. <br>  <br>  Most people today take the commitment and vows they made very lightly.<br>  <br>  Rather than taking the time to get to the source of the problem and work to resolve the situation, people would rather walk away and hurt one another even more.<br>  <br>  As a Christian wife and mother, I strongly fee that another issue, is that people are not living according to God's word, and that in itself is another problem. If more people would live their life as closely as possible as given as guidelines in the bible, than most problems that marriages have would not exist. Infidelity, finances, communication, lack of trust, dishonesty: all of those things are covered in the bible and instructions and guidelines are laid out as to how to best achieve a happy life.<br>  <br>  Those are my thoughts. I would love to hear from others as to why they think divorce is so high.

6d0iJ4RQaa	Your boyfriend is lying, if he invited you to go and wants you to go, then he WANTS YOU TO GO.

cf47cf823c2cc1d62cd647cd7533bab9aa	Take the time to sit and talk about your feelings. Make sure he understands that you care about what he doing, not just nagging. It is you right to know what is happening and when. If he loves and cares for you as well then he will listen and be compassionate of your feelings. Don't ever be afraid to show true emotions. Healthy relationships and marriages are based on emotions and feelings. If both parties are misunderstood then solutions become harder to achieve.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Matt|`|AA10928742	U and I, need to speak!<br>  <br>  catch me online on yahoo messenger (navin_poonacha)<br>  <br>  there are lots i wanna know and lots i could express to u|`|a0006c6b7400e813f5300a2225d62953aa	i agree with christyne  n|`|AA11992636	You have a serious self esteem problem.

86ad32c7ada7c07685feafde5922bcb8aa	Well first of all...once you do get the courage to talk to her make sure you are yourself...(otherwise being so nervous it will show... which she might also like)  <br>  <br>  Make sure you talk about her...what she likes to do, etc...something she can relate to. (this is also a way to get her to talk more so you don't have to do the talking until you're more comfortable.)  AND REMEMBER No matter how dumb you think you sound...she has heard worse and as long as you are sincere and polite  there's really no such thing as saying something dumb. (unlesss she's a @#@$@, which can also be fun, but thats an answer for another question...)<br>  <br>  Also you can always get her email or her instant message and use that as training wheels,,,ya know chat a little and learn something about her before you really start talking.<br>  <br>  Also remember she is just as nervous as you.<br>  <br>  ANNNNNND...my last point...the first conversation or two are always the toughest, as you get to know her better the convesation will be easier.  <br>  <br>  I used to have the same problem...so when I really wanted to talk to girl I would think of three things I know about her and start off by asking about those things...then hopefully the convesation will be in full swing, before I ran out of my three talking points...<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK YOUNG BUCK!|`|487dafc16f68676631537ab7aba3c808aa	Write her a note.

The age old bugaboo.  First, let me tell you a few secrets.  One, your question is not stupid, it is genuine.  Your not making up your feelings, your experiencing them.  Your problem is not talking to this girl, it's your shyness that you must work on.<br>  <br>  How.  So easy but so difficult.  Ever hear of Muhammad ali the boxer.  He said every time he got in the ring, EVERY TIME, he was scared to death.  Stomach would be so upset he want to throw up.  Yet he got in their and became a world champion.  <br>  <br>  You must feel the fear, it is important and then go ahead and throw yourself out there.   Over and over and over again. The fear will never go away, it's part of nature, but eventually you learn that many times you will be successful.  <br>  <br>  Try getting out of your own head, meaning pay attention to the person your interested in and talk about them. Women love when you talk about them and THEIR interests, rather than being clever, having a slick line, giving a lot of fake compliments or sounding like someone else who is supposed to be cool.|`|6d1dd20c1096467d247abfe4e9d443e5aa	Maybe you should tell ur friend to tell her that u like her back and tell her to talk to you and then you can have a normal conversation. DONT FLIP OUT!!!! trust me girls like it better when guyz are either a little shy or totally confident in themselves(but not overconfident) U CAN DO IT jsut get comfortable around her.

48fe5f79560bff851b618351681d3eafaa	Well you do not have near the problem you think you do. However your actions speck far louder than words. <br>  <br>  It is quite possible this girl might have liked you if she could have gotten to know you. Being shy.....and you are right you are over the top on this...is very hard to get around, especially at your age.<br>  <br>  I was shy when your age, quite a bit like yourself. I never had a girlfriend because I was too afraid of the possible rejection. I had a chance with a girl once as she kept smiling at me as I left study hall. But I could not believe it and kept on going. Before long another, not so shy boy, took her out. There was no more smiling after that.<br>  <br>  At your age getting around being shy is almost impossible. But as you get older it will get better.<br>  But you will have to work at it.<br>  <br>  The fear of rejection, fear that we will be laughed at, fear that we won't ever measure up to her expectations keep us from even just saying hi.<br>  <br>  A girl may even trip you and fall under you but there is no way a shy person would think it anything more than an accident.<br>  <br>  You have a very bad self esteem. The only way to help here is for you to realize that you are just as good, or even better, than every one else. That is called confidence and unless you develop that you will always have problems with girls.<br>  <br>  However it is not all bad. This usually means you are a really good guy who cares a lot about other people. This you never want to loose.<br>  <br>  As for me I met my first wife at age 23. In fact the first girl I ever went out with. Married for 37 years. We divorced, in part because of my inability to open up and talk. I am married again.<br>  <br>  There are lots of girls out there. Practice on your confidence. You develop that and you will have no more problems.<br>  <br>  The difference between a shy person and a confident person is as follows:<br>  <br>  A shy person will meet someone and just know they will not like them.....so they say nothing.<br>  <br>  A confident person will meet someone and just know they will like then....and will walk up and say HI!<br>  <br>  It is as simple....and as hard.... as that.|`|2fb851cfbad2286678890ead42014f6eaa	i know its hard as you are really shy but you need to be brave and strong and just go and talk to her about if she is intersted then you done the right thing and even if she isn't interested at least you know you can approach girls you like now!!<br>  <br>  So go for it!!!|`|5c5ed7f351cb695b9e6980f616a7019baa	Man, welcome to the world of girls! first of all. stay calm. you do that, she'll respect that. stay calm stay calm dont panic! just let her know whats up! and dont be nervous (well try your best) communication helps alot. let her know. somehing like... "hey, i lost that note or whatever. so i dont know what was in that, you know i like you. the next step is up to you." something like that... just be calm, and if you go up to her and tell her yourself, as opposed to having other people go up to her and say "oooh that guy over there likes you"... thing will work out better.|`|718d0fb68d47939ba7c6e45d2284317aaa	Set her straight.Tell her how u feel and ask her out> U'll regret it if u dont..Doit b4 its too late.|`|c2fa3130bffdfb0212e33dc2b0b8ef75aa	First of all:  What are you thinking?<br>  A girl that you likes send you a note and you dont take it.<br>  Sorry to tell you, but the signs you are showing is that you do not deserve her attention.  <br>  <br>  Even though, you might have one more chance.<br>  Just ask for her phone number and after one long conversation, aks her out.   JUST DO IT!!!!!|`|4582a857fe73584c0fff40c4f1537198aa	ur screwd man...im sorry but itz true!!
099b875af641ee7291824adf37803730aa	it is probly because they don't want to lose him they are just scared they will get over it.|`|AA11137163	They proberly always disliked the girl or were unsure of her but they tollerated her to see their son/brother happy but then with the thought of marriage they feel they need to be honest about their feelings or at least put forward their concerns. This can often feel like an attack as the moher/sister feel they need to do it quickly before the wedding. If the girl was to agree to a very long engagement the family would have a chance to relax and get to know the girl better without the pressure of a marriage. Its not so much about their disslike of the girl but more about their love for their son/brother, they dont want to see him rush into anything or to forget about them. Remember they were the most important people to him before this girl came along so try to be a little bit understanding and make them feel wanted. You will feel the same when you have a son :)|`|f6124891a54c284f54a8754e9b36b55eaa	I don't know.  Thank goodness I don't have that problem, as my MIL is a very nice lady who couldn't wait for her 37 year-old son to get married once and for all and move out of her home.  <br>  <br>  (Not that he lived there because he didn't have anywhere else to go, but more like they were a close knit family who culturally all live under the same roof -- He's now a good husband and good provider, and the best man any woman could ever hope for.
a9ca661863ed310020e44732f2c8c358aa	It's different for every girl.  You can't make a blanket statement about what girls like, because they don't all like the same things.  <br>  <br>  Don't try to be something you're not.  It might help you attract a girl at first, but you won't be able to keep it up forever.  The only way to be successful with girls is to be yourself.  You want someone to like you for who you really are, not someone you are pretending to be.  Just be yourself!  I know it's cliche, but it really is the best advice.  Good luck!|`|5bc502dd1d4ad09ec078fddc0258caf3aa	Bad guys.|`|1ea7db92bddc82e18ccf67f43c867399aa	you shouldn't change yourself just to get girls. i would want a guy to just be himself. it's sweet that your willing to change, but you shouldn't have to.|`|21b9dd6ca0451f9a98a55989693467deaa	you should just be yourself and everygirl girl want different things|`|5fae87d2099ca786e0dd691de6f9ceb6aa	Every girl is different.

6d0iJ4RQaa	You ex seems very insecure, he seems like he has to identify himself with a particular group or way of acting to make up his inner self.  I am bi-racial, and I remember being a kid, having trouble identifying what I was exactly.  Then as I got older, I realized that I am...me.  Your boyfriend seems like the type who has to act tough to be a man, and the truth is he probably really wants you, but because of his personal insecurities he's unable to express his emotions so he expresses hate.  Now, I am not saying to take him back because people who exhibit these personalities traits usually create domestic abuse to the fullest extent, so you did the right thing by letting him go.  My advise is ignore him, and try and stay away from him because although you are not together, if you keep a line of communication with him then you are leaving yourself vulnerable to his irrational behavior.  With individuals like this you have to learn not to evaluate yourself, but keep in mind that you are fine, its irrational personality disturbed people like him that will try and verbal, emotional, and eventually physically abuse you so he himself can meet expectations to his own personal insecurities.|`|c4Q0Lh0eaa	It sounds like this guy has extremely low self-esteem.  He probably views himself as a loser and the only way he can cope is by putting the people around him even lower than he is.

If I want to be with her for any reason, I'm going to choose to live my own life by the standards I'm comfortable with -- not someone else's.<br>  <br>  We are who we surround ourselves with: If you surround yourself with people like your ex bf (who seems to have some mental problems btw), then you're going to continue to have low self-esteem. <br>  <br>  Get - and stay - away from people like that and find people who WANT you be be around.|`|4EWCegiRaa	Sounds like your ex is a racist womanizer.

8b2326a26537e6378b41e0c51fae1a92aa	Try to find friends you have common intrests with to begin with. Don't be afraid to invite them over or suggest to do something with them. The most they can say is that they aren't able to do or go with you. Also if some kidds in your block go to the same school as you try to make friends with them. Remember when you make one good friend, you'll always be  making more than just one because they come in packs, not singles. SO have some confidence and do the asking occassionally and soon then they'll ask you to do things with them.|`|AA11564348	Part of it might be that you don't ask.  I always feel weird asking friends to come over.  I have friends that will just ask anyone without a moments hesitation though.  To get people to come over sometimes you just have to ask.  As far as finding new friends just act like yourself.  if you do stuff to try and make friends like wear the clothes their wearing or act like them its hard to make real freinds.  after you've found friends, like I said earlier you just have to ask em to do somethin.

9419c799c4c3386646b4c59b6232b717aa	First of all if you are  not married get out of the relationship...If you are married and just want to "sample" something different...do this: Make sure that the other person understands your situation, its sometimes helps if the other person has someone too, so you have limits. If you are talking to someone get a track phone or buy another SIM card for your present phone and give the person that number and that number only!! Only meet for lunches and happy hours and always stay on your toes so you will not have to lie as much. Have one friend who you can truly trust that will keep up your alibis follow these rules and Happy Hunting!!|`|26895520b344fbc3d9d0e7496f0e96ebaa	You don't.

ad2a02ef041d76b2e2f13c6a3604cd89aa	yes and no-- they will not need a "father figure" in their life so they won't be looking for guys much older than them who will try to dictate every move they make- and check out the brother- because most likely if she gets along with him well- she will be looking for a guy that is LIKE her brother.....so it is not a negative thing to date a girl with a good dad and brother- they can clue you in on what she's looking for and not.|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	You could be right after all they are getting all the love they need at home so why go out and look for it when it is right at home.

This is rare, and usually is associated with sport injuries when not wearing a cup. Even when can be repaired, the resulting inflammation will turn most of the contents into permanent damaged material.<br>  -Even a medium force trauma will cause the destruction of spermatozoa-production cells. It will not cause sterility because those cells are in massive quantities, however those cells do not regenerate, it is permanent damage. And if hit many times or too hard, it may cause infertility, because the sperm count/mobility must be acceptable in order to get a woman pregnant by natural means.<br>  -Will also reduce spermatozoa production as a result of hormonal changes, one of those changes is testosterone reduction.<br>  -May rupture major blood vessels, and draining the scrotum will be needed. Or microscopic veins inside the testicles, this will permanently destroy cells indirectly.<br>  -In case of very extreme trauma, the testicle/s can swell for more than a weak, with resulting excruciating pain and severe damage from prolonged heavy inflammation. The swelling reminds me of mumps, but in the case of mumps it will cause sterility for sure, and the testicles(usually just one) will shrink too, very sad and scary.<br>  -In some cases may cause the antibodies to start attacking the person own sperm.<br>  -It even may cause death as result of PAIN, heart will fail right away or will begin to fail(heart beat will became fast and irregular, usually face and lips very white) until finally stops, this is called “neurogenic shock”, and it is not that rare like people think, most of the times the victim is saved because gets medical attention on time, it will need shocks to the heart using the defibrillator!.<br>  -Among other symptoms, the victim will feel shock/panic/confusion/anger, violated/abused, embarrassment/humiliation; those feelings will be stronger if young; especially if they do not know or never heard about “kicking in the groin”. The victim may seem ok, but will try to hide those feelings. It depends on the person and from the situation. This will lead to Post-Traumatic Stress, the worse symptoms may only reveal a year lather! People forget about emotional trauma, but it is the worse, and will not go away like the physical suffering. All men that “like” the fetish called “ballbusting”, have some kind of mental or emotional disorder; and the most common cause for that is because it happened to them in the past, they are physiologically very ill, it may change their life’s completely. The emotional trauma of being assaulted in such a private area, or the physical suffering, or the fact that it is a barbaric act, should be more than enough for girls not to do that; but the sad truth is that the only thing that make some(not all for sure) girls think twice before doing that is the permanent physical damage.<br>  -Physical violence it is only acceptable if you are trying to defend/escape yourself from someone that is trying to use physical violence on you, and you may only use the necessary violence to ESCAPE harm. And kicking someone in the groin is only “acceptable” if someone is trying to kill you, or rape you(only extreme EMERGENCIES), not because you are pissed off, and most certainly not for fun like it is most of the times, keep it a fantasy. Why you girls don’t tell your Dads what you did, I am sure they will be PROUD of you.<br>  -Ironically, if someone is trying to kill you or rape you, probably is expecting that defense from you, and so you will not be able to kick him.<br>  -This is becoming too popular, specially in schools, girls get sexually aroused by that!. Women look sweet, but…….they are very mean and cruel by nature, they just try to hide it, it is very sad. Lucky for women men are not very vindictive like women are, and men are not very aggressive towards women like women are towards men, in fact men are very protective towards women. Men like to see and touch women sexual organs, they do not like to hurt them or to see it happen to women.<br>  Women are so much sensitive about their sexual organs and sexuality, but then do that to men and laugh!<br>  -And nothing happens to these sex offenders because they are women, just one of many double standards and laws that always treat men worse!<br>  <br>  “women justice” is sick, how about if it was the other way around?!!!!!!!<br>  Girls answers regarding this issue are always disgusting!|`|189ef50a67eb1b9fd9e229f4bd038790aa	when he feels the pain... its not nice to do it but they get the hint that you arent playing games they get serious right away|`|AA10048805	Nicky and Accidentaly - good answers!

We're looking at different maturity levels and even though you're white and he's black that's not really the big issue here. It might be that this guy is afraid of what people will say of him being involved with a white girl. I've been into white guys as long as I can remember and a lot of them are afraid of what people may say if they found out they were involved with a black girl. Society still has a color problem and many on both sides black and white are afraid of what people will say to them. I think that today you shouldnt be afraid to go public with who you're with. Part of breaking the stigma of society's issue with color is to show that you can be in love with someone of another race and it's OK. IR relationships will have its challenges because you will encounter people that do have a problem with color and even though you can't change that all you can do is live your life and if some people have an issue with it it's their problem not yours. Part of a solid relationship is to communicate and if you don't have that you have nothing. I would not have sex anymore until you've declared the status of your involvement with each other. Most people are satisfied with the friends with benefits deal you deserve more and I would ask this guy where does he want things to go and make your decision from there.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	race had nothing to do with a relationship they all take work but I could see how some inter-racial couples could have it a bit harder than most you have the looks and stares from other people just don't worry about them or do what I do I start making out with my husband when they look at us like we are the weird ones|`|9CMGO5fhaa	Family issues!

I use to be like that, I currently work for one of the major banks that are being bailed out, and it sucks.  My managers are all up our ***, with unreachable demands, and they are currently laying off an uncountable amount of people.  I have come to realize a couple years ago, that people as a whole have little control over their lives.  I feel that this concept is a very difficult one to accept for intelligent people, primarily because when you think a lot , and you are a really self-motivator, etc. its hard to accept the idea that we do have little control.  After writing this response, I can walk across the street, and get hit by a car, the truth is, how do I control that situation?  The answer is that I can't.  When it comes down to your situation, it seems like everything that could possible go bad...is.  Regardless of how bad things get, the point is that you have life, you have to ability to be free.  A job tends to be such a comfort zone, and I personally feel that it has to do with what we see and hear, WE NEED A JOB!  THE ECONOMY IS IN CRISIS!  BAILOUTS!  However, at the end of the day, you still can do what you want to do.  Look for another job, and if you can't find one, then maybe you were meant to do something else with your life.  I know I ramble, but the point is that regardless of how bad things get in your life, somebody always has it worse, so try and appreciate what you do have.  You have life, you have choices, and you have to pick yourself up and work towards what is in your heart, or you will be eaten up by your personal insecurities, and the failure that you think you are will come true.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.  The college degree has nothing to do with it.

But hey don't let your guard down baby, and fall too easily, because like you said you hope he's not talking to you just to get some. So hey just take it slow, you'll find out the truth.|`|1845253e6d2efa27aeb816781dbb61b5aa	He want to have sex with you and then dump your @$$. Thats what all guy's want in this world.|`|d393dc6d5339f97bdc97361a16fa3c96aa	If he just wanted 'to get some', he'd probably jump at the opportunity.. I'd suggest giving him a couple of weeks and then talking to him about it again.  It might also be the case that he only likes you as a friend.  Again, this is something that you'd need to talk to him about.

AA11474891	First of all, that's not always true........<br>  <br>  Maybe you are saying that because women have curvier rounder faces.<br>  <br>  I see where you are coming from I think.  But I've seen many women compliment a man's smile, including my own smile.
f4d41fa575eac5b76b4bca5bd7b780c0aa	Well, right before you guys go out like to a movie, or to hang out at each others houses, just make sure you ALWAYS have a pack of gum on you, pull one out as soon as you guys start hanging out and say, "Would you like a piece of gum" Or do the same with mints, pop a mint or a tic tac and say "Would you like a mint/tic tac?" Most liikely, she will take u up on the offer. The good thing about this is that, you dont have to be mean by saying "Your breath is really kickin, here take this peice of gum before i throw up" You are polietly asking her if she would like a piece of gum. If she says no, then get her something that smells good to drink, like koolaid or fruit punch or fresca or something so at least she can have a good taste in her mouth for when you kiss her. Hopefully this answered your question, good luck!|`|ecf77672d37857017ccbc3d997f17539aa	if her breath is so bad to you, just stop letting her give ya head or tell her to brush her teeth afterwords|`|33567a8558abba0b68555aa05a1907f7aa	By drinking plenty of water and brushing <br>  your teeth regularly, you can prevent bad<br>  breath.

Yes, if he is really the one he'll still be with you in the years to come.|`|kbz5S3waaa	if you love him, then go for it! that's what i did! He proposed to me in my senior year (he was a year older), we got married a few months after i graduated, and then a few months after that he was gone. It was hard, yes! was it worth it? Yes! I love my husband very much! there is always ups and downs, especially in a military marriage, but in my opinion that makes your bond stronger! Good luck hun, and you're only too young to make that decision if you feel like you're too young.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Sounds like he has all his ducks in a row, but what about you? Don't you want to go to college and become something and someone you can be proud of? Get yourself together, and if he's still there, great.  Worry about you now. You're way too young to be thinking about a commitment like marriage.<br>  <br>  With a military man, if he moves, you move....going to college won't be easy.  Don't run away and live his life before you have a life of your own. It will be a HUGE mistake!|`|oNXygeVZaa	I think that you should ask yourself that question in about 2 yrs.  A lot can change by then.  So don't worry about it now.  I met my husband when i was 14 - started dating.  we got married when i was 24.  I had no second thoughts.  Good luck.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Oh my God...honey.  YES YOU ARE TOO YOUNG.  YES YOU ARE TOO YOUNG.  Just go to school and make a great career for yourself.

Yes, I do think your too young to think about marrige, have a relationship and see where it goes with you two's changes, a lot can happen while your off in college finding yourself and meeting new people and things can also change him as well, take your time and see where it goes:)|`|9CMGO5fhaa	you sound responsible, I just want to tell you I was too and making a lifetime decision at your age especially one like that seems easy but years down the road you might feel as if you missed out on life so if I were you I would wait for a while on that.|`|AA11819105	I knew a lot of guys in the military [including me] who got :dear johns:<br>  Your very young and most young gals cant wait 2 years if you were like 25 or older id say yes but the odds are you wont wait|`|XlhBBZPxaa	well really you answered it yourself if you need to ask the question then you are not ready <br>  just go slow why such a hurry to grow up|`|AA10500537	yes you;re too young  <br>  there are too many things out there for you before you get married and start a family|`|Sm0rYAnCaa	YES, YOU ARE WAY TOOOO YOUNG!!!

He will change by virtue of his experience in the service and various schools and you will change by virtue of  your experiences in college.  A study once showed that marriages before graduation from college have a very high rate of failure, especially in  the fields of law and medicine.  both of you will change and not be the same people in 6 years so it is better to wait and see who you are then and whether you still feel the same rather than make a marriage now that will not last that long!!|`|QS17RXDAaa	TO YOUNG! just be together dont get married yet. You have waaaay to much life ahead of you to jump into something like marrage at such a young age. Give yourself some time, def. go to college.

But one that was extremely embarrassing to me happened recently while moving into my new apt. My daughter's 20 yr old fiance & one of his friends were carrying one of my night stands out to the pick-up, when my vibrator(sex toy) fell out of it. I nearly died!! I hadn't used it in so long that I had forgotten it was in there, it was in a box but when the box hit the ground~it fell out! Of course both guys were embarrassed too but they still tried to make me feel better. They both told me that their mothers have them too, but that didn't help much. I still wanted to crawl under something & die!! So did my daughter!|`|4539bcc3ecd096b6e4f651f8851a0c2faa	why would anyone want to reveal their embarassing moments? ....just wondering|`|98bd69596035d3d914bdfef969a15a15aa	I was my dad's best man when he got remarried.

I was totally head over heels madly in love with a guy - we lived in the same flats so I had to see him every day - watch him bring girls home (Grrr....!! Lol!) and it was torture. For 5 whole years I said nothing. It got to the stage where I was physically sick - I idolised him. After a lot of soul searching I finally had to tell him - for my own health if nothing else. It was SO hard. Nothing happened between us but he is now one of my closest friends and I wouldn't swap that for anything. Babe, in 5 years, which will you most regret?  Either not tell him and in 5 years still be single wondering what could have happened if you'd just got a little courage? Or risk maybe making a little bit of a twit of yourself? I'd rather be a twit and know once and for all. Babe - if I can tell a guy who I had to live with and see every day then you can do it too. I tell you now - you will feel SO much lighter. If he's a decent man he will not make you feel like crap over this. He most definitely will not laugh at you - it's a huge compliment and he will be flattered. I promise you that you will feel better once you do this - whatever the outcome! At least you will know hey?! Best of the bestest luck! :) you CAN do it!!!

7280904025d1da53975cb4cfccd8194faa	I'm not a guy, but I know many guys would answer, "Of course!"  What do you think happens when you like someone or their vibe, the moment is right and you do what feels good!?|`|070acd6453e880fd563a2a3c744a2757aa	no, but they ask me.

qJO7Q4bfaa	But do want sex ? Go for it you are 16 get as much as you can.|`|08c02a30c600f861e6e06079b7485198aa	Well I'd say run from him and leave him alone. Does his current girl know he's cheating on her with you. Because if he wants sex and the making out with you then he's actually cheating on her with you. Get out of there fast and the faster the better. He'd do the same to you if you were his girl and you know it. Trust your heart girl. So what he's known you longer he should remain faithful to his current girl. Sounds to me like he's near dumping her for you not a good situation there. Cut off all contact with him until he comes clean to both of you girls. Both of you girls deserve better and you know it. You might be dealing with a player there.|`|07DurjX7aa	Honey, he has a girlfriend.  If you were her, you'd be pissed.<br>  <br>  If he REALLY liked you, he'd end his relationship with her before asking for sex from you.
abcef21f35c1b7e1c21c4f95d70f6632aa	Just enjoy the relationship and don't express this to him yet.  He may be having a great time and having a fun youthful relationship but it might make him run the other way if you start talking love.  15 is very young and this will be a relationship that you will learn alot from but keep it fun and not too serious,  the relationship will last longer and you both will avoid alot of unnecessary drama.|`|eb19f7a6edda28e77b0ef77a7274021aaa	if you think your in love?

Qof4KYGKaa	Well, you can go around the question and ask the person what would they say if they were in your shoes. It mostly depends on the question or favor. If you are not able to spare time, or afford, or etc. then tell them that you are sorry and you do not have enough _____ to spare. But if it was some kind of invatation, then tell them that you are busy. It all depends on honesty.|`|3133748e2b6ba5836def7f3978d06d3baa	omg...

AA12023950	Just hang on and help her get more friends... Once she has more friends then maybe you could just kinda fall away slowly...

aeZZu1HOaa	After my wedding my husband and I framed a picture of us with them at the wedding and gave it to them.  It didn't cost much but it meant a whole lot and they hung it up in the foyer.  I'd highly recommend that route.|`|AA11312653	When someone does something nice for us, we say thank you. When someone does something especially kind, like including us in their dinner party or sending us a gift, we thank them with more emphasis by sending a handwritten letter or note. When someone does something especially grand for us, we MAY want to thank them by sending a gift along with or instead of the letter.<br>  <br>  So the short answer is "You don't have to, but if they've been especially kind, generous, or helpful it would be very gracious to do so."|`|AA11380378	"Have to" no; nice, polite and expected in certain areas, yes.<br>  <br>  It doesn't have to be anything expensive or fancy, just a token of appreciation especillay after all the work they put on for the wedding<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	You don't "have to" do anything, but you should want to honor these special people with a token of your love and thanks.  It is customary to present your parents, as well as your in-laws, with a small gift to thank them for all they've done for you, not only throughout the planning of the wedding, but in your whole life.  They don't have to be expensive, just meaningful.  You could give your mom something as small and inexpensive as a photo album full of photos of the two of you together since you were a baby, and she will treasure it forever.|`|sGP6s7uraa	It's nice gesture to do so.  I don't think you necessarily have to but it's good to let the 'rents know that you appreciate them standing by your side.

KWeU8LJtaa	Screw that, I'd sell it. Especially if he was the one that broke things off. <br>  <br>  If after almost 3 years he can go out and get a girlfriend in a week, the ring obviously doesn't mean much to him.  <br>  <br>  I say sell it on ebay, if you pawn it you won't get much.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Did you break up with him?<br>  <br>  When my ex and I broke up, he too, gave me a promise ring..

Shortly after wards, I stopped...  <br>  <br>  If your ex keeps running to this "other girl", I wouldn't even bother with him anymore...  Don't add to the fuel.<br>  <br>  Just be mature and walk away.  If he asks for the ring back, give it to him.  But other than that, I wouldn't contact him and just let him be "happy".  :)|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	if he was the one who broke it off, you get to keep it.  if you broke it off, he gets it back, unless it was given to you on valentines day, or christmas as a gift<br>  <br>  although, since its a promise ring, i think those are ALWAYS considered gifts...so yeah girl, its yours.  ebay it, pawn it, do what you do|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	I agree with your dad.  Return the ring.  A promise ring under these circumstances is like an engagement ring in that it is a conditional gift and it actually belongs to the person who gave it and not the person it was given to.<br>  <br>  In your case the condition was to become engaged.  Since the engagement didn't happen then the ring should be returned to your ex.  If he says you can keep it then you can pawn it, sell it,  or trade it in for something else.<br>  <br>  If you send any letter with the ring then just tell him you didn't feel comfortable keeping the ring since the two of you were no longer together.<br>  <br>  as to him crawling back and forth between you and the other girl:  he won't do that if you stop it.  Don't take him back and ignore him.  Giving him the ring back will send him the message that the two of you are history and that may have the added benefit of him staying out of your life.|`|jK9H6PHiaa	Sell it my dear. I've received so many promise rings I can't count on my fingers and toes put together. Lol. Frankly its usually something children do and promise rings are not extremley expensive. That's why there's no law saying you have to give it back. <br>  <br>  a promise ring is a ring saying I promise to be with you forever not like an engagement which is almost considered a contract to become married. And hey promises are broken everyday and he broke it. He promised you forever and you just accepted his promise. <br>  <br>  You owe him nothing. Best of luck and I hope you find someone special to spend forever with.|`|c76bc0ffbd77bfaaa2937eb65cf4e252aa	Keep it and do what you please with it.

It was given as a promise for a future relationship and that has not happened. I suppose you could ask your ex if he wants it back. If he says "no" then you could do what you wanted with it. But I think you should at least offer to return it.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I returned my engagement ring because in Virginia, it legally belongs to the one who proposes.

If you break up with that person you should return the ring. There is obviously no law stating that you have to give it back, however, in my opinion its the classy thing to do. <br>  I don't think writing a note is necessary, however, if you feel inclined to write a note I would keep it short and simple.|`|vCZuh3oDaa	You may keep it if you like.  Etiquette requires a lady to return an engagement ring if SHE broke off the engagement, or if her egregious actions (for example, infidelity) caused the dissolution of the engagement.<br>  <br>  Promise rings, on the other hand, are always considered gifts, and thus are given without the expectation of return.|`|4FNwqO4baa	It's a promise ring, not an engagement ring and it was a gift. He broke his promise, you get to keep your gift. Giving him the ring back just sounds like unnecessary drama. Let him live his life and you live yours.

If you think you'd rather keep in hopes of him coming back you could do that. <br>  <br>  But if he's that much of a jerk to keep crawling back and fourth between you and this other girl you could sell it or give it back. I would sell it because it was a gift for you. He broke his promise that the ring symbolized now you can profit ;)|`|CyNVXM2qaa	That ring was given to you as a gift.  it is now yours.

5lPIKcOaaa	DOSNT MATTER ABOUT HIM, your children cannot be and should not be allowed to grow up with an abuser, even if he does not do those things anymore, you cannot grantee that he will not do it again in the future. If you cannot trust this man around your babies, then there are better, more fitting men that can provide a loving caring environment for your children, where they can live and grow and see a normal relationship take place. This will turn them into good adults. If they witness abuse or are abused they will have many problems when they are older. I suggest you make a decision quickly.
e0N0hfqZaa	Dear Visira97,<br>  <br>  I know exactly what you are going through. It's a very scary, lonely situation you are going through. But know where there is a will there is a way. First Prayer, only GOD can give you the strength in times like these. Seek HIS guidance and He will deliver you. I am going through the exact same situation so I know you pain. I like the part you said " I want to start fresh without him in my life" it shows that you are willing to make the first step. Do you have family that can help you get to where you want to be? Someone who can lend you money to make your first step. I have a friend who got away from her husband and her family helped her find an apartment and she found a job. She had 3 kids and she moved to a totally different state. All you need to make is that first step. Go to a place where there is free counseling if you need more motivation. You can do it! May God Bless You and your Children. I Pray you will make the right choice. Good Luck in finding a New Beginning!|`|Ikd9cppcaa	You need to take the kids and go to the women's shelter (maybe a rape and abuse crisis center) in your city. These are secret locations so he won't be able to find you. It's going to be hard for you to start a "fresh" life when you don't have a car, money, etc. You don't say if you have a job....so I'm thinking that is the main reason you have stayed is that you don't have a career or job to support your kids. Good luck.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	You need to get a plan together for yourself, and you need to get a job and your own car.

He's going to have visitation, your kids are going to see their father, not matter what. Once you are away from him, try to make new friends, meet new people, if you feel lonely, he's not the whole worl, he's not the whole picture, you're in the picture too.

Usually, when you really love someone you don't desire to be with someone else.  The only thing I can say is try to follow your heart but at the same time give yourself time.  If you really love the guy your with then sit down and tell him what bothers you and see if he's is willing to change and please you.  If nothing changes then you know that will always be a problem.  But don't try to be with both at the same time because then your feelings will really get confused and it will be harder for you to decide and at the end you may loose both.  If you love the person you have try to fix things and let go of the other one.|`|0feaf1c170a2a2045c5bed92a8955002aa	be with the one that you loves that also loves you
a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	In our church, members are married for free. Most give a free-will donation. We are giving $300 to the church and a $200 gift to our Pastor. I feel that non-members who are using the space should have to pay something, yes. Like someone else said, there are bills to pay in the church like power, cleaning, etc, and those things should be taken into account. The pastor usually does not get a fee for the wedding, most of that money goes toward the church itself and perhaps a bit pays the pastor for the hour of time he's "working". <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|rlUUaSgqaa	They usually charge if you are not a member of the church.  I don't see anything wrong with it.  They need to earn money to survive as much as the next guy and most pastors don't earn that much.  You have to pay all the other vendors, why would you not pay the person who is doing the single most important job of all?  If you really can't afford to pay the pastor but want to be married in a church, you could probably explain your situation to them and they may be able to give you a discount or do the wedding for free.  In that case, though, I would hope you'd have a really simple, no-frills wedding.  I would find it pretty pathetic if you could afford things like having your nails and hair professionally done that day, but claimed you didn't have money for the pastor.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yes. If you are a currently practicing member of the church, you may get a discount or they won't charge you anything. And in good faith, you would make a donation but it wouldn't or shouldn't be demanded of you, thus it is not a donation. But it does cost money to have the lights on in the building and for the pastor to take time out of his day to marry you. <br>  <br>  For a non-member, they usually charge much more. Typically it is to deter them from just using a house of worship as a pretty backdrop as many people like to do. <br>  <br>  I don't understand your question of "is it right or wrong?". Should a member have to pay? No. Should a non-member use a church as a pretty backdrop when they have no regard for the church otherwise and expect that they should not have to pay either? Of course not. It's a house of worship and should be treated as such. A church that doesn't get an income (i.e. not charging anyone for using the building) isn't going to be able to pay their bills and the payroll.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Mine isn't but we are providing him and his wife a gift certificate to their favorite restaurant.  A "thank you" gift, if you will.  I don't think it's fair that a pastor charges a couple but there ARE web sites that offer officiant (sp?) services for a fee.  A big fee at that.  I see no problem with this (the web site gurus) but not an actually pastor of a house of God.|`|lUO6wLGAaa	The couple should make a donation.  You're planning to turn all the  lights on, right?  Besides, the pastor shouldn't be expected to work for free.  Even though a wedding is a pleasant job for them, they're still "on duty."|`|yQdA5rHnaa	usually unless you are a member of the church you are getting married at|`|LPEWAoWCaa	Yes but if you're a member they just want you to make a donation|`|6AYA3GWWaa	Every religious institution handles this differently.  Some places will charge rental fees, some ask for a donation, other places waive fees for members, etc.<br>  <br>  At the church where I work, there is a rental fee for the use of the Sanctuary/chapel space, with additional fees for the church sexton, sound operator, and/or organist.  Members of the church pay a reduced fee (one-quarter of the regular room rental fee).<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that the officiant's fee is an entirely separate matter.  Many ministers/religious leaders will charge a fee to perform the wedding.  That said, I know our minister does adjust his fee for those with budgetary concerns (we are in a lower-income area, and we would never price someone out of getting married). <br>  <br>  As for whether it is right or wrong...  I know it may seem crass to charge someone to use a church, but churches need to stay in business, too.  Like so many other non-profit organizations, churches and religious institutions struggle to pay expenses and keep themselves solvent.  (I can't speak for the megachurches with thousands of members, but for us little guys, things are particularly difficult in the current economic climate.)  We have high overhead (this old, stone building needs a LOT of upkeep, and you wouldn't believe our heating bills!!) and without the support from our membership and the income from rentals, we would never be able to perform our ministry and continue our community outreach programs.|`|PY160XO7aa	No they don't charge my wife and , mine didn't anyway, but I did give an offering. If you were charge it could be for use of the church, i would be ok with it as long as it wasn't outrageous. If you tithe to the Church shoundt be that much|`|68MkdEgiaa	They do charge you for their services and the price depends on if you guys are involved members of the church. They also may ask for a donation to a local charity or cause if it's going to take place in the church|`|ldXSIWEyaa	if its your church, and you attend frequently they will not charge. although you are supposed to give a donation. some of my friends have gave as little as $100, and the most $300|`|rpVQpJA7aa	If you are a member at that church, then no. But I think it is common for people to give him a thank you gift certificate or money. They do a lot of work.|`|gKW1ufGbaa	a $100 to $250 donation to the church is customary/expected.|`|lxaDUcoEaa	many wont have a charge per say but it is generally understood that a love gift or donation is the way to go

74fdfaceeaf0bc6f509086d1486ce9cfaa	Society has set us up with that frame of mind.  Men are taught that that's the only true way to relate to a woman.  And women are taught, "If you love him, it's okay".  Sex does not make a relationship.  It just adds more stress.|`|7c8803d95e0200cbe89d423eee39b50faa	thats a really good question...pry bc most things that guys think/talk bout is sex...i dunno but call me an oddity id rather just have a relationship w/o havin the social pressure of sex involved|`|AA10457907	well is a sign of love...every living things have sexual relationship ex dog...|`|AA10477118	1- guy relate a relationship to sex<br>  2- girls relate a relationship to emotional stability<br>  both are part of a relationship you can't have a healthy relationship with out both aspects|`|AA10843237	well, not all relationships are about sex,and i give my ovation to those who can keep things pure. however, the mentality of young boys as well as girls also, has it that sex is a bonus of a relationship. perhaps some may not anticipate it but as time goes by and familiarity breeds passion (not contempt in this case) therefore, conscience gets blurred and decisions were made based on their raging hormones. some have thwarted mindset that relationship is for sex, primarily. and that is bad because sex is very volatile. yes, it may feel out-of-this-world at that point of time but that would be the last thing that will sustain a relationship through rocky times.<br>  i guess the best way is to protect yourself from people who just do not respect your space and body. in that way you will know that the guy/girl is right for your relationship as sex is not the foundation of it. it has to be more than that to build a realtionship. and the question of sex can be a very good test to see the genuinity of the love u guys have. it can actually break it or to mak it stronger. oh, besides.. sex is usually (if not IS...) an agreement between both parties, therefore there is no particular side to point the finger at. just be wise...|`|AA12151175	Lets see, TV, movies, books, magazines.

0e5e9f680f86651f422eeeb089a3945aaa	in any relationship its going to be that way. some days you both will be madly in love with each other...other days youll have to worst argument of your life and maybe wont even talk to each other. no couple can stay together without little arguments or even big ones here and there. every fight you both will have will only make the relationship stronger...sometimes it may even tare a relationship apart. it just all depends on what each of you wants out of one another...and how much the other one is willing to give.<br>  <br>  -stephanie|`|402bb1999b56f96827a52b1b337a8dd9aa	I heard someplace that the first year or so of a relationship is like "puppy love". After that year, you start to get deep into relationship stuff. You find out what annoys you and what pisses you off. That's when you start to argue. That's OK. But you also really start to love each other deeply (hopefully).<br>  <br>  I'm 26, and dated a lot. I dated a few long-term. I broke up with a girl about 8 months ago who I dated for four and a half years. There's no easy answer. There is no answer, probably. The older you get, some things make more sense, but others, like relationships, don't ever quite make sense. But that sucks to hear that when you're young. You really can't understand it. <br>  <br>  <br>  Listen to Dane Cook's "The Nothing Fight". If your arguements aren't like the nothing fight, you should be OK.|`|AA12258788	Every couple gets into arguments sometimes.

I hope you talk to guy and tell him how you feel.|`|ee21547c5ead09ff286ec1fe3cbf6846aa	If you can see yourself with him in good and bad times and not just sex or hung up on his looks than you got love for him- never give your love away too easily!|`|f5963866bf021594331efadbb01a9bddaa	love comes naturally, obsession is desparation and rushing. remember "love is patient and love is kind."|`|0fbb01137fbc8406fffc1e564bb55f93aa	if you know and appreciate someone for who they are, it may be love. However, if it is just an acquaintance who gives you butterflies, it is probably infatuation. I won't call it obsession, because that's a little over the edge, but its not love if you can't honestly say it is. If you have to ask, its probably not true.|`|AA12037593	cant say it's not luv, only time will tell u that.<br>  If u only know him online...it's probably obsession, 4 now anyway.<br>  be careful, good luck.|`|2948423bf32d621c192777b791381727aa	hey id love to tell u but im kinda confused|`|AA12132909	Obsession, but that's ok.

Other wise u can try.........|`|bb97a79ecde4988ea84df8c72e70f82baa	If either of these two people are your friend, then it is very disrespectful to interfere with their relationship.  It could mean that you are thoughtless and inconsiderate, and if the person you want to hit on senses that, then you have no chance anyway.  Sit back, relax and perhaps the relationship already taking place won't work.  Then you can have your chance the right way.|`|AA10735939	No!   Leave them alone.

9ef11fd7477f42fc35ce844d35d90adbaa	the best thing to do is sit down and talk to him.  let yourself cry for a while, it helps vent your feelings.  and u need to talk to your friend about blurting out your secret.  and with those kind of secrets u need to keep to yourself.  girl everything with turn out the way its supposed to.  if this guy really loves u he'll listen to wat u have to say and understand.  if u need to talk more or need more advice e-mail me ok.  hang in there.|`|2948423bf32d621c192777b791381727aa	hey if ur sad im me and ill make things all better (thats if u want i hate seeing people sad) well u know where to find me|`|77e3a136c013cc670a32a44114802ceeaa	The past is the past. Let it go. It's not as though you did this thing over a year ago to hurt your future boyfriends feelings. That's just not realistic. He also had a past before you. Ya'll should let sleeping dogs lie. He'll get over this just give him some time to process it. It probably hurts him to think of you with somone else. if ya'll really love each other he will find it in his heart to forgive you. now don't sit around and worry all day. Good luck|`|e0b8e3680607fe7aa401657a94972bcaaa	I am a guy and when I get pissed off, I just need time to get over it. Guys can get over anything with time.

I am sure you don't know everything about his past. Find a guy who has some balls.|`|18dc2c19d10a1881fe0c0fa6ae6405a2aa	Is there some reason you kept this guys name off the list? If so, I believe you thought it was a good reason..even if it was to not hurt his feelings, if he didn't like this guy for some reason. Just tell him why you kept it from him. Guys are pretty simple beings...and yes I mean that in EVERY sense of the word. lol Just explain to him...in terms that make sense to HIM. I don't think you will have a problem. Most people understand if you had a LOGICAL reason for not telling him. lol Hope this helps.
9dc68774dacaa108a7eada4d0b7ef32baa	Sweetie,<br>  There is nothing wrong with you and you WILL meet a guy you like someday! You aren't weird! 15 is a long way away from being an old maid. LOL Don't worry so much about what your friends have or haven't done and you take care of yourself! If you feel uncomfortable with a guy, then trust your gut and just go with your friends! You will have lots of opportunities to date boys that you actually like all through school. If a guy hits on you and you turn him down, it may bruise hid ego, but he'll live. Just let him know you are flattered but maybe that you are quite ready to see him in that way. You'd rather get to know him better first.(if you do want to get to know him) Just be nice about it; try to let him down gently. You need to follow your gut instincts on boys. Only you know what you are comfortable with. Good luck and have fun, boy or not!|`|9838074a83600d02f7a1d54f3f9de1a5aa	Gurl trust me im 16 and i never had a real date wit a boy. yea i got and had boyfriends but never a date wit one to experience it. I think that u should go because its what u want but u also have to tell him that u dont wanna be with him like dat. tell him this is  a dte but not a date date. you have to be strong and be able to eease urself round him and u never kno u might just start to like him as u get to know him. Just consider all the options before u say yes or no.|`|AA11102607	well, first of all, you need to ask yourself if you are really into guys (im serious). then, you need to realize that kissing is almost nothing, and you might as well go for a kiss if he tries for it. if you feel nothing from the kiss, then don't proceed from there. have fun with it.|`|ac2d2f803cd21e660ebaeeec6057efdcaa	Do what you fell....go for it..!|`|AA10865094	If youre unsure in any way. you shouldnt go with him.

Go because you want to have fun, obviousley consider the guys offer, if you like him, go with him, maybe he's a great guy.|`|AA10906439	Don't go.  Just excuse yourself politely and bow out.  If you're uncomfortable now, just imagine spending 8 or 12 horus with him.  Don't give in to social or peer pressure.  Only do what you are comfortable with.|`|bbdef9141b55ff9cc05bf352be4185e7aa	just talk to him,ask him can I ask you something really important.then just spit it out and maybe he would understand.|`|f6b5c2ac94df197c2a5fa1bd8d5ac24faa	Tell him about your expectations because it is better if he knows in advance.

AA11624615	why? because they're guys? [hehe] i know, i know. that's not much of an explanation. but it's probably because you don't talk to very many or am not used to it yet. i usually pretend i'm talking to any other girl so there's not this thing where i treat guys like this and girls like that. it helps alot. but of course there are just some things that i don't talk to guys about ya know? but even though sometimes i am comfortable talking to them. there are still alot of times when i'm not. even though i keep telling myself that they're people too. just like me. but despite everything.. i'm still shy and scared myself sometimes. just wanted ta let u know u weren't the only one. =) . well.. hopefully u'll be less scared and shy around guys. good luck.|`|515a4fc25fcb71eb0ed19b7a1a012764aa	I dont know you soo I wouldnt know.

Normalmente lo que te puede llegar a suceder es que tu matrimonio se haya formado cuando la confianza entre tu y tu pareja no estaba fortalecida, o habiendolo estado decayó por algún motivo. A mi me sucedio un tiempo pero por problemas que habíamos tenido a nivel de pareja, una vez recuperada la confianza no es nisiquiera preguntar ?que has hecho cuando estuviste sin mi"?, pues la confianza hace que cualquier cosa que tu pareja haya estado haciendo en cualquier lugar seguro no sería malo para ti. Aveces las mujeres se vuelven rompes como vos decis porque no tienen la confianza suficiente en su esposo y entonces tienen 10.000 de dudas que no pueden resolver.

AA12220324	I did once early in our marriage, I was 19, wife was 17.. jealousy wasn't the word for it... immaturity may be more like it.... I got mad every time a guy looked at her and I blamed her.... fights were always about money, never had any.... one time in particular she hit me, I hit her back, hard in the shoulder, threw stuff at her, punched walls.... all the crazy stuff..... still can't believe to this day that I did all that. I regret each and every second now that I did that.... we split for 3 months, got back together, then did it again a year later.... split, filed for divorce, 9 months into it got back together..... we were just kids-crazy I know..... we've been together for over 21 years now and I haven't hit her since, wanted to in my mind, but didn't.... of course she has hit me numerous of times, but I guess I can deal with that... looking back now yea I should have never hit her, but sometimes we may be driven or pushed over the edge of no return... no excuse, I take full responsibility for my actions, but sometimes we are not always 100% to blame... maybe 99.9%... some say once they hit they will always hit ISN'T always true...

Ask yourself is the friendship worth the risk?  After confessing your feelings for him, be prepared that he may or maynot feel the same.  If he doesn't, please be aware that things might be akward between the two of you no matter what.  That's part of the risk you have to be willing to take.  3 years is a long time, I'd like to know if he feels the same way about you.  Have you ever hinted around being more than friends?  If so, what was his response?  If you haven't, do it now.  If you tell him your true feelings, you won't lose him as a friend.  Things might seem strange between you for a while, but it will get back on track.  If I were you, I would go for it.  The best relationships are ones that start out as being just friends.

362f24a50ce729d88b05e85c7f1184d3aa	As an AA women myself I'll say this.  Ask yourself this question, "How would I feel if I found out that my wife had male friends that I knew nothing about?"  You'd be pissed, wouldn't you?  That's because as a married man you have no business having female friends.  If your wife found some other man's conversation more stimulating than yours how would you feel?  The fact that you find other women's convesation rewarding while you don't really talk to your wife is grounds for serious trouble.  Believe me, I have had conversations with women that my hubby met and chatted with online and they don't give a freak that a man is married.  They play the supporting role of friend and wait for the opening.  Luckily, I nipped that in the bud but too many marriages have broken up because the husband had female friend whose conversations he found stimulating.<br>  <br>  Go to counseling.  It seems like both you and your wife have issues to work out.  Believe me, if both of you are willing to put some effort into it and and do what the counselor says you will seem so unbelievable changes in your marriage.|`|3c3acad74bd0cfea08d642c20352d0e3aa	Yes it is wrong. A word of advice. You cannot convince  ANY WOMAN that you are around other women without her just for company or conversation regardless. Let your wife know how you feel and what you are doing.|`|75e781bc14ff7cdceebc75552cd8bd37aa	As long as the relationship is friendly and not malicious, ITS OK.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you need to consider the fact that this action of yours may hurt your wife's feelings.  It may appear different to her.  She may take it the wrong way.<br>  <br>  Why?  Is your wife not good enough that  you look to other black girls for companionship?<br>  <br>  Be careful ok.  Be sure you are explaining this to your wife.|`|9123cfee67ea5e03e95bacc631a86ee5aa	OK so you prefer "black women" got that part. You and your wife need to go to counseling to find out why your communication is breaking down with each other. And quit talking to other "black women" or other wise for that matter your just agitating your wife. I'm not a black women but I think any women regardless of their race would be frustrated with you always talking to other woman period.........!!!|`|bf818afbea766f7b0bfdca2d619111e7aa	As long as it's platonic.. although she might not care whether it is/isn't. It's best if you try not to hide that fact from her, it'd just make you look guilty if she ever found out (even if you're happy with your relationship).|`|47de065ee4612c872675e28b37c15e85aa	That is a communication problem between you and your wife.  There is nothing wrong with talking to other women about things, but if you can't talk to your wife about it then you shouldn't be able to talk to anybody else about it.  If you aren't liking the reactions that she gives you tell her about it.  That is the only way to fix it.  You shouldn't hide your feelings.  That makes the relationship almost fake.  Because technically you aren't being yourself.  Not talking about something will only make it build up and bridge a gap in between the both of you.  Continue to keep your friends, but your wife should be number one.  Good luck, God Bless.

Be yourself for one and see what you both don't or do have in common. Just FYI though work is work and if you did get in a relationship with this guy that could turn sour that could hurt your rep. So I would take it easy and keep it friendly.

Your question is too vague to solicit a reasonable response.|`|4ff0fd7bb74640e1958bcc90b8338320aa	that means he is mad. he was just pretending, you know tryin to keep cool. i would pobably be mad.|`|b8d2a087a637b0ca91e6e521028876d5aa	huh???? say the Question again but this time put periods and other stuff! i cant read wat u just typed!!!

AA11565976	Aww! First of all, what you wrote up there as your question made me go "aww" because that is so sweet and right now I think I'm falling for someone myself :) Anyway, I think that you should first of all make sure that you really do like him. Because I know sometimes I start to fall for a guy just because he gets taken--ya know what I'm talking about? I know it's bad to do (like, it looks bad to the other girls), but it's just what comes over me! It's kind of like an "oh, he can fall for her, so I'll see if he can fall for me..." BUT the thing is, I never try to STEAL a guy from a girl EVER and I never would--I hate the girls who turn their flirt on with a guy I like, and I would hate it even more if someone were trying to 'steal' my guy. But, really though, if your friend likes you back, he shouldn't be going out with this girl. It's not fair to her or you both. So yeah, like you said, you "THINK" you're falling for him, but you don't know for sure/ what to do? make sure you do like him, and you're not just "in it for the chase," and if you decide you really do like you friend in "that way," privately let him know and if he really does feel the same way, he should know he shouldn't be going out with someone he doesn't care about at the top of his list.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry if that was a lot of rambling, but I honestly hope it helped at least a little and I wish you the best of luck!<br>  <br>  Have a nice day!|`|AA10888686	If he has got a girlfriend it is best to just step back and see what happens with the relationship.. I know that If my Husband Russell had a friend that was a woman I would have wanted her to step back and not ruin it for us..

We're, the same, mad for each other but he has a girlfriend! Let me tell, u, ur doing the right thing right now such as laying low and not acting upon it. Ur gonna want to act upon it but try getting deeper with him as thoughts and feelings towards each other are concerned. It can end up better than you think. U might get hurt and you might not, nothing can be garunteed but its better if you know than having no clue to where this friendship/relationship is leading to. Before you get deep, wait a while or a few days, whenever you think is fine. I'm havin the same problem,lol...i don't wanna break what they have either =(, its tough, i know what ur going through! =)|`|1ea7db92bddc82e18ccf67f43c867399aa	so he likes u to?? if he does then he shouldn't be such a dumbass and just break up with her! i have the same situation with a guy right now, only he doesn't like me.... which is worse. he likes some slutty girl.... im gonna go ask a question about that...

2fb37a8ebb97ff7b61a51e4350042036aa	WOW, sounds like my and my BFF's story. My BFF's was that he ended up breaking her heart because she believed he liked her and he only liked her as a friend. Mine is that i didn't believe that he liked, and not only didn't i get hurt when he told me he only liked me as a friend, but his hotter friend as me to be his girlfriend. Moral: go with, but don't be obsessing that he may like you. for now, just be his bud.|`|AA12364312	YEAH, HE LIKES YOU.|`|ghkjFKJ1aa	he probably does like you but he doesn't know how to show you. If you like him, you should step up because he might be too shy.|`|7326d288ff855f6dc35885b03db8fc09aa	probably....|`|LFjSb2wNaa	If he is rude to all your friends then why do you care if he likes you or not.  You can definately do better.  The last thing you want is a boyfriend your friends hate, because you will always be choosing one over the other.<br>  <br>  If you are good at math, maybe he just wants to copy off of you.
yqNMzGQhaa	Um, just tell them you have a boyfriend. What's the big deal?|`|62667e16f76b2c574b8547e8c0f04b94aa	how old ru|`|4dc728b149d9b0f5dac24653b1f7f30daa	maybe have a friend bring up the topic in front of your parents. Something like "That guy that helped you throw away your trash, didn't he ask you out?" you could be like "yeah, he did and i said yes. he's a great guy, but his friends i don't care for." Let your parents catch on what your saying. Don't make it so they can tell that's how your telling them. I hope it works and good luck!
cb9a6ccf766715fadd892c30059577a5aa	He sounds like a perv, I dont think he likes you. I think he is looking for the wrong thing.

b93a43b74258dfb035c858afa3602b3daa	No it should not but you will find a lot of women that will not date anyone that is not employed. That don't mean they are bad or stuck-up, it's just that women have been taught thru the years, that the men are the breadwinners and should provide for the women. The women's equality groups have a problem with this question too, they don't want to get started that a women can take care of themselves and an unemployed man, that would be too much equality for them to take. Now, It is important that you get a job and your own place. You don't want it said that you can't take care of yourself or pay your own way. There is a woman for each man, it's finding the right one for you. Good Luck.|`|1ea7db92bddc82e18ccf67f43c867399aa	have u even been looking for a job?? if your looking she shouldn't care as much. but your gonna want to get a job very fast if your already thinking of marriage.|`|8960e320e99cbc3a3cd17569519c9037aa	I wouldn't even talk to an unemployed man.|`|AA11240107	i think we need more info......... how long have you been unemployed?  a month, or a decade?  obviously, things happen and people lose their jobs; i think we all know that can happen to ANYONE.  however, if this is the story of your life, that's totally different.   most women want a man who is ambitious and financially secure.  (notice i didn't say RICH;  just secure).   also, think of yourself........ don't you want to get your employment issue squared away before you start a new relationship?  it takes a lot of energy and time to be in a relationship AND be job-hunting.  if you wait to approach her until you are employed, you will be more self-confident and she will probably be more attracted to you because of that confidence.  good luck!|`|fb3b68f46a4f4fb0eb907891c526e30baa	You can't afford to be in a relationship - so not good to pursue one.   Work on getting your life in order, get a good job and then start to look at having a relationship with someone.  As a female - I won't date men that don't have a job or a place of their own.

Or maybe youu just don't like the guy, you're only adoring him!|`|c9bd04ea559ec67ec990e5614e38688faa	ok hat you can do is hang out with other friends.

Start in the UK (if that's where you're from) perhaps go to the seaside somewhere you can both get to on train. Tell several friends where you are going and which hotel you are staying in and when you're due back. Send them a couple of texts to make sure they know you're ok. Say something was to go wrong, it;s a lot easier to find you or him int he UK or if you are abroad. After a few UK meetings, if they are successful  then go for it - just don't go swimming with sharks before you've put your flippers on!|`|ce7ea7f83a5ba171eb4ef78c629b25a3aa	I would if I clicked with the person - at the end of the day if it all goes belly up it is only 1 week and you don't have to stay together - just make sure you book separate rooms in case you need time out and if you feel worried then stay in busy areas<br>  <br>  Are you feeling wary or are you just wanting people's opinions because if you have any doubts then think hard before you book?|`|aa679c6ce84a2ca860911237a432449aaa	To be honest it depends on how long you have know this guy, going on a vacation is not a bad idea as long as you know what you are doing and that what you are doing is not going to get in the way of how you feel about it, if you think that you should go then go, but if you think you are taking a big risk then don't go and see him more before you decide to go on a vacation, after all your decision is what will make or break a trip, reguardless of where you are going and why. If it is a business trip then go as a business not as if you are in a relationship if that is what the situation is, but this is a choice that you and only you can make so make it wisely.

fb1ed3167a523260716234177b7983d1aa	Nope its not bad, they're jealous because you are popular and outgoing and they stuck up little snobs. What should you do? Tell them to go *(&^)!! themselves|`|AA11160104	you shouldn't stop hanging out with people who are your friends just because other people call you a s!ut.  sure, some girls who have a lot of guy friends are that way, but people shouldn't assume so.  I used to hear that sometimes because I have a lot of guy friends, but I stopped caring what people think because I know that I'm not like that and that the people who accused me were ignorant or jealous.  Just be yourself... don't lose your friends because of a stupid accusation by others.|`|4fbd9607b6e284395b94362881ada0f4aa	no its not bad to have a lot of guys friends. That is just like me, i just can't stand having friends that are girls because all they do is cause drama. Its okay to have a good time with the guys. They are fun anyway.|`|9f2c2e552e6a7a219345e443180cf595aa	It is not only right to mix with guy friends, it is important to do so for any girl. Too many girls just pick one guy, assign him the position of boyfriend and then give him exclusive rights. As a woman living in modern times where divorces flourish, you must take great care in choosing your mate. You are not in your mother's generation where you don't get much chance to go out to discover what men are like. In fact it is your responsibility to find out how one guy can be different from another. Or else how would you be able to look beyond his charms to find if a responsible person exists there?<br>  <br>  However,  when I say mix with other guys I am not encouraging you to do a disservice to your self. There is a difference between mixing and involving yourself with multiple males. If you have casual outing with them is fine. But if you get personal and sexual then you have crossed the line of respecting yourself. So set your boundaries clearly and make as many male friends as you wish, but always remember that no woman enjoys being used. Such a woman is not even respected by the guys who use her. As a woman's reputation is important, you should guard against men who test your boundaries. <br>  <br>  If you are being told that you are a flirt simply because you hangout with other guys, then you must examine if you are being told that because when you are with guys, you allow for a questionable degree of physical contact with them. Some women describe this as loose behavior inviting trouble. They may be right.<br>  <br>  Mix with as many males as you want but always remember that you are a female and that you should be respected and not taken for granted.  Then you are on the right track and men will always respect and even admire you. If this is what you are doing and your female friends start calling you names, then it could be that they actually envy you for being able to draw males to you more easily than they can. So you may need to question the quality of friendship you have with your female friends.<br>  <br>  So in short, enjoy yourself without disrespecting yourself or your gender, and you will not only find a suitable mate, but you will also win the respect of your girlfriends too. So go have good fun for now and don't worry about what others are saying. You are a young modern woman, but more importantly -THIS IS YOUR LIFE..|`|Hifabp6jaa	WxHxOxRxE!|`|f0b88c1335c0521614c5c5b73b49b6c6aa	People assume i am a slut or whore or whatever you wanna call it too because i have tons of guy friends i just tell my friends the guy and i are just friends and tell them to stop|`|kje3Woblaa	i have alot of guy friends i don't click with alot of chics well i had a best friend tha was a girl who did me wrong. well are they JUST friends? if so then tell those haters to just mind da business and stay out of yours. your friends should be who you want them to be weather they are girls or boys not what other people think you should hang out with.
13ac03c45ed93375d305437745b75995aa	I made a mistake once of not moving forward physically with a new guy after recently breaking up with a long term boyfriend and I deeply regretted it. It all depends on how long you have been dating this new person, but trust me. You should definitely become intimate with them, especially if you are saying they are special to you. Don't jump in the sack if it's been a very short while, but after some time I feel you should. Hopefully this new guy is understanding of what you are going through, but definitely don't wait too too long cuz it may get to be too late and then you may feel extremely hurt or angry that you missed out. Allow yourself to experience someone new that you care for. Good luck!|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	If you can't don't force yourself.  Let it come naturally and tell him what is happening.  It's easy to have sex with men we don't like but when you feel that connection, you want it to be special, and it should be.  Tell him this and if he truly cares about you as well, he will give you time.  Good luck.
3dc2bfa8aa5ecc6cad23f493c698ed9caa	I don't know. I'm starting to wonder if there are any people with a sense of humor left in this world. Laughing is the best medicine. My advice: try to date women that do not have too much baggage. Less bitterness more fun. Good luck|`|0bc674e292b1b2fa86577efdbe7b3ff4aa	You must be looking in the wrong places. I got my finance after high school and she loves all of my stupid humor. Bars suck for girls and so do clubs. Most of those chicks just want the "hottest" thing out there that treats them like sh*t. Not an actual nice guy with humor.|`|1482b2ae48dd952ca2b3219ee18c819baa	There are lots of women with great senses of humor, but you need to recognize that there are somethings that might not be funny to most women.

HZ2ALTOcaa	Hey need advice guy :)<br>  <br>  Well first of all, as a girl I think that If she's your best friend she should know you right, like the way you are, the things you say when your playing, or joking. The commend that you said, it is not to get mad about, specially after a great night out with her. Now, I think that the fact that you like her is making you feel, like you have to apologize. I suggest, that next time you see her, don't give her a serious apology, just be like "hey the other night I said a commend and i just thought you should know that it was just that." <br>   Another thing is been about 8 weeks you said, than she probably allready forgot about it, or if not she's not mad about it any more. I don't think a person can stay mad for so long over a small comment like that.<br>    The best of luck... Hey why don't you tell her personally that you have feelings fer her, you have to take risks from time to time in this life you know ;)|`|1ea7db92bddc82e18ccf67f43c867399aa	you should definitely confront her. but dont do anything else to freak her out, if she doesn't like u like that then just take it down a notch. but to get her friendship back, its been 2 months so its gonna take a pretty big gesture. bake her a cake or cookies or something as apology and go to her house, or just go out of ure way to make sure she knows that u want her as a friend still.|`|LvWhoclOaa	you will gio to here house and bring something that can make her happy,bring what they want.|`|Tl1waevQaa	Have you thought of writing a letter.  It sounds old fashioned, but a lot of times it works.  If that doesn't work, just find her, and talk to her.  If she isn't too big of a jerk, she'll listen.  If she doesn't, she isn't worth your time.  You could find better girls.
n1yfqU6Haa	Ask him about the things he likes. that way you will find out if he is really worth your time. Think more of yourself, sometimes the most precious gifts come in quiet packages. I`m a christian and the bible teaches that a woman with a meek and quiet spirit is a precious thing.|`|AA12149264	Talk about your interests.If that doesn't work he may not be the right one for you.
4136ab69ce10dd402c6cb8ab3fda1c15aa	Honestly, life's too short and we all shouldnt be serious all the time. you have to live day by day knowing dawn well that tomorrow dont belong to you. I'd say take advantage of today, tell him how you feel and if necessary, tell him you wont take no for an answer. I'm sensing that he wants the same thing and if he dont, you would know sooner than later and that also would help you not waste your time and effort. I hope that would help. good luck!!|`|4Ujdp7vGaa	i admit i have a friend like this...he is one of my very best friends.  and he knows how i feel about him...how i fantasize about him...and is willing to be friends with benefits...but knowing i want more from it...we just enjoy each others company and keep it nonsexual. ( we do hug each other and all....he has the BEST hugs!! we just keep our clothes on..LOL) it has not affected our friendship since i told him how i felt (about 6 months ago), so i am thinking it probably won't in the future either. I'm not sure that everyone could handle a relationship like that...but i think it happens more often than we realize (or admit to). so kick back, relax and enjoy this great friend you have. chances are, if he finds out...he will be flattered, even if he doesn't think of you in that way.  :)|`|FFvpuIwvaa	yes, i do this all the time! but just wait for him to take the next step.. u shouldn't put too much hope tho, u might be disappointed..|`|M1U3MRdfaa	I am a huge advocate of fantasy making life much more interesting but this situation may not be appropriate.  If both of you are single then "go for it".  There can be no harm in a little sexual fantasy.  <br>  <br>  If, however, one or both of you has a partner it is something to be avoided. Even though fantasy sharing is good for a relationship once it becomes personalized to someone you know then it takes on a different twist.  Whether you realize it not this will absolutely 'poison' the relationship you are currently involved with.|`|qjFUN2TJaa	that's a big problem you know...try to confront him..and besides you're close friends, aren't you? but be prepare for whatever he'll tell you , sometimes there's  guy like that but there's nothing behind reasons for their inter action. you're lucky when he tells  you that you're both have the same feelings. gud luck..|`|Q0cnTzocaa	Honey i think it's perfectly fine to fantasize bout a close friend but are you sure you don't have alot more feelings for him than you think???!!|`|qmuVGed4aa	i know u have known him for over a month but if u want to take it to the next level u have to make the move

P9XxUAjhaa	Long distant relationships usually end up that way.  Being cheated on sucks!  It is a violation of trust.  Sadly we all either have had it done to us, or have done it ourselves...  That doesn;t  necessarily make us bad people.  She shouldn't waist her money on an investigation.  You know what...  it is probably the assistant who wants more of him than he has been willing to give her.  He probably really does love his girlfriend and is just satisfying the physical need that all people have!  Your friend first needs to decide if this is something that she views as forgivable, we all have our own feelings.  Once that doubt is planted, it never truly leaves...  she will always wonder now.  Sadly, as bad as love hurts, especially when a "thought to be" happy relationship is completely yanked out from under you, we all manage to move on.  That's never what you want to hear when you are sad.  But tell her this "He wasn't the one for you and by being with him, you have stopped yourself from meeting the one that is.  You have sacraficed a lot to make this work and unfortunatley it takes two.  Chin up buttercup!"|`|vGx6lhCmaa	You tell her no man is worst her life there is more fish in the sea.  Just get yourself and start getting out and start praying for the man of your dreams, because that one is not it.  He will proply want you to forgive him but let it be your choice not his.  He will tell you things that he think you want to hear.  Don't be fool he did it once he will do it again.  Unless he is born again and ready to settle down and be a husband.  But if your friend want to she need to get out and maybe one the day the right man will come along.
5ivy8X2Haa	you gotta tell them sooner or later... sooner would be better... :D|`|7aaaa4687fec8d3e7857d9ba2555c4dfaa	First and foremost, take a home pregnancy test to confirm.  You can even go to Planned Parenthood and they can do a test for low or no-cost for you.  Then you sit down and talk to your boyfriend, decide what you both want to do.  Once you're 100% positive of your decision, both of you need to sit down and talk to your parents (and his).  Just be honest with them.  They may be disappointed and/or upset at first, but they'll appreciate your honesty ... and things will get better in time.  I thought my parents would freak out about my first pregnancy, but they were very understanding and supportive.  Best of luck, hon!|`|6601b87bfe80ea984542da96cd76b759aa	First...you need to find out for sure if you are pregnant. From your question, you sound very young. You have your whole life ahead of you. Even though you may be 'madly' in love with this guy... more than likely if you tell him you are pregnant he will ditch you and you will be stuck raising the child yourself. You need to make a decision about your life and the life of the child. I am not promoting abortion, or give away adoptions, but you need to grow up real fast and make a decision on what your life will be like in the future. There are too many young girls like you that are so blinded by what you think is love and you cannot see the forest for the trees. Life is tough enough without having to be responsible for a child that was not originally wanted to be brought into this world. I suggest you get professional help on this subject. there are lots of free places out there that will gladly discuss your options. The internet is not the place to get help for your situation. Time to grow up and realize that a few minutes of pleasure can cause your dreams to end really fast. Good luck.|`|7db91f9bbaf97d8af7cfdb8eb0c0a032aa	Make sure you are pregnant first....<br>  The you will just have to break it to them gently.|`|V83940eiaa	Take a deep breath, and calmly tell your parents the situation.

rJRM9l4Aaa	I don't think it's a good idea to go and date this guy without<br>  your parents permission.  I know your anxious, to date someone. The best thing to do is to tell your parents your<br>  ready to start dating.|`|AA12227191	really be caareful you really don't know people on the internet. Meet him in a public place with friends.

He has to know what he's dealing with. Ask him to meet you somewhere, but tell him to bring a parent or friend and you do the same to be safe. After doing that 4 or 5 times, maybe your parents will trust you and the boy enough for you to go out on your own.|`|eUe3l7u8aa	tell your parents first communication is key ,you don't want something like that hangin over your head, it will make everthing worse in the long run, trust me.|`|xgiDXLLqaa	your dad would say *NO BOYFRIENDS UNTIL YOU ARE MARRIED*

If he is really good at basketball, likes it a lot, and just won a game that you went to, then do this:<br>  <br>  Compliment him on his game, tell him his strengths in it, and just keep talking about it.<br>  <br>  If he starts to flirt then have one of your friends ask him if he likes you, then if he was shy when he said no and was blushing, or said yes, then ask him out, if he said no and looked truthful, then just save your friendship, and see if you can get it moving faster later on.|`|eAJ0QXpMaa	Have you talked to him??<br>  if not then TALK TO HIM!!!! :D<br>  let him get to know you!!|`|fe081faa445313eb8770ec66a8e28719aa	Maybe you should start out as friends and flirt alittle.

4ca81500aebe54b51da20dd58cb54766aa	First off, disregard the comment your friend made about asking a guy with a similar personality if he'd have read the note. It's her opinion that this guy was similar, and even if he was, it doesn't mean anything.<br>  Second, there could be a hundred reasons why he didn't read the note, maybe he thought it was childish, or he didn't like how other people were getting involved, maybe he wanted to hear it from you, or maybe he doesn't really believe it came from you, maybe he doesn't like it when girls ask him out, or maybe he's so shy he doesn't know what to do, or maybe he's not interested...<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if the note wasn't your idea, he doesn't know that.<br>  <br>  Forget about the note and move on, start with something simpler, your getting too complicated too soon. Just ask him to  hang out with you somewhere, like a mall or coffee shop, don't jump right into telling him you want to be with him.. for a guy (or anyone) that can be intimidating.. just go a lot slower..<br>  Hope I could help.|`|AA11264550	wow .lol this is very interesting. well maybe he is just as confused as u are. if I were u I would just flat out TALK to him and get to know him better. just DO it. and ask him about the note and everything. well I hope this helps.

u9hEVWVraa	Hey, guy, don't worry, it's going to be OK. When I was younger, I never seemed to be able to meet girls. Year after year, things got just a little better, and one day, I met the perfect girl for me and we got married. It does work out, it just takes time for some of us, you know? My advice: bars and dance clubs and places like that never seem to work out for guys like us. Get involved in clubs or classes you like and sooner or later you'll meet someone through one of your activities that is interested in similar things. That's the best way to meet someone.|`|aB3tACWtaa	Hey man if you wanna kill yourself that means more girls for ME!!!! <br>  You don't believe that! You said "I spend 6 Monthes lonley"<br>  6 months dude, try sixteen years! I've never dated in my life or had a real girlfriend. You don't need one if you want one that bad! Give it a break, the more desperate you get the more angry you'll get with yourself when the ladies turn you down. It's not that I can't get a girlfriend its just I don't want one (WHY TO MUCH DRAMA) my lifes simple I don't need an pressure right now. You need some anti depressants. Killing yourself pfff. You won't do that you love yourself to much and if you think its okay to kill  someone because they can't get a date then your REALLY SICK and need to stay away from women.|`|d195847d21383a61626ee72088e02adfaa	you must answer this question" why girls doesn't like me?!" . No one can answer this question except you. May be some thing in your look, or in your feelings( outside, inside). Talk to yourself and find it and fix it.|`|1arLyjgeaa	You need to talk to someone who is a good listener and can  off you good advice|`|8fe360b4701a7a3d28b89f74752cda15aa	right first things first, dont kill yourself and try dont hate yourself.<br>  <br>  ive had the same problem too and have hated myself for things ive done in the past and the rest. but now ive learnt to like myself and dont care what anyone else thinks about me, thats how you should feel, feel good with yourself. By showing your enjoying life and independant and happy with yourself and what you do.. you are more attractive to other people.<br>  <br>  now i know i dont get many girls either, ok im not being totally honest, i may have had a few but you know what i never make a move. maybe you appear to desperate to people? im rather patient, give it time and one day you'll meet the perfect girl trust me and she'll be lucky to have you!<br>  <br>  have you ever thought there might be a reason why they wont dance with you? now im not saying anything is wrong with you, maybe they are snobbish. but why dont you try something new, get a new haircut, hobby, job or maybe change your look overall. you will feel alot happier with yourself if you do this and you will act more confident. if someone is horrible to you and wont atleast dance with you as friends forget them and if they say something nasty to you say it back. also you may e after the wrong people. and more importantly dont change for anyone else.<br>  <br>  another thing 6 months is not a long time, ive been single one whole year and im in no rush to meet anyone, enjoy being single.<br>  <br>  i also recommend seeing a doctor or councellor if you feel depressed. it may help alot. good luck mr :)|`|DK1NrAe9aa	alot of people have the same problem,since im not old enough to go to clubs and all that stuff i dont have to worry about it. just dont worry those girls that walk away from you or avoid you are obviously not the ones who look for the right thing in a guy. sometimes it takes people years to find there partner so dont rush into things to try and find someone that ISNT for you.
W3p38cgJaa	She needs to grow up. I hope you told her you were sorry that you did not mean to do it> If you didn't than you need to do so. Be mature about it and don't act scared at all. Be sincere and just tell her that you surely did not mean for the ball to hit her and that you are sorry and you hope she will accept your apology. If she thinks that you are scared then she will surely cause you trouble. Stand up for your self..you did nothing wrong..Don't go around hiding from her that is silly. Have a few friends watching our for you in case she does jump on you so they can help you if need be!! You may as well face this and get it over with. I know you dread this but if you have already said you were sorry than just watch your back..hold your head up and act as tho she doesn't worry you at all. Act as you always have in front of her. If she brings it up to you say I feel so bad about what happened and again I'm so sorry.. Unless she is just plain mean she will accept your apology. Good Luck Sweetie|`|AA11668488	depending on your age,which I am assuming you are in grade school or Jr High.The girl either likes you and took it personal or she is a bully and dont listen to Ambassador because I could kick any boys **** in grade school to High school and made the boys run with my female smarts and incredible strenght!Say sorry and tell her she looks pretty today,you will get forgiveness AND make her feel good!Good luck!|`|a379fab62947c926e83e0dc8267e9ad6aa	See if you can find an adult/coach/school counselor, to sit at a mediation session between you and the other person.  Accidents happen; especially in team sports.  No one has the right to intentionally lay hands on another.  There could be an entirely different reason this other person is feeling so defensive, and you just happened to be a good target.  Mediation works well and should assist you and the other person to find resolution.  DO NOT allow this person to intimidate you.  She doesn't have to like you, but she does have to respect your safety.  She should also be informed of the legal ramifications of accosting another person.  Good luck...|`|AA11191613	tell her you are sorry....<br>  at least try anyhow|`|8SSbGA2Paa	you don't run away you take the lumps..let her use you as a punching bag.. or you confront her and tell her your sorry and kiss her butt..|`|AA11287399	Wow... that sucks.  First of you were playing a game.  It's not like you wanted to throw it at her head, it just got in the way.  You need to try to talk to this person, let them know it was an accident and ur sorry.  It's pritty lame hating someone cause they didn't have thier head in the right place.  Good Luck.|`|AA11845254	This is very easily solved.<br>  Have her called to the counselors office.<br>  the counselor will get you two laughing in no time and you two will part as friends. It would help to bring her a little tOKen like a new pencil  with her name on it as a form of apology. But even if you don't... it will be ok. Just don't try to have her jumped.... then you will be jumped next.|`|c6fd002f468e8d1f0aaf2d660d40979baa	If you're a girl, just never make eye-contact with her and pretend that she doesn't exist.

Go kill yourself|`|dc71e94d6f398b2290ab328759d660c2aa	Tell her it was an accident.  Maybe have counselor or principle call her in so you can apologize in front of them.
CKciVdbEaa	Show some interest in her, but dont be clingy. If you are the type that is up front, ask her out. Some girls dont like games. I know I dont. If you are more on the reserved side, just try talking to her, ask her about things she likes, be nice. That will get her attention. And please, just be yourself.:)|`|uCwaF28haa	Start singing "Kiss the girl" from the little mermaid? Actually, if some guy did that for me, I'd die from laughter and think he was really awesome, but I'm kind of out there, so if I were you, go to links2love.com. its got loads of random girl (and guy) advice on how to tell if she likes you and if you should flirt more, and whatnot. Just never EVER use a pickup line like "Did it hurt when you fell from the sky, because your an angel." Those are TOOOOO cheesy.|`|1Kj82IjIaa	the only way is if u ask her out..<br>  ask her come on ask her!!!!!!!!!!!|`|7mtLAjbDaa	Act like you dont want her.<br>  <br>  but you still gotta talk to her.<br>  <br>  How do you mix it?<br>  <br>  A neg.

0xJZJggVaa	I wouldn't. Can the favors. If you don't keep them cool, you'll have a blob of chocolate in a box. Strawberries are seasonal too.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Not for a wedding, but I did lots for a gathering. The only problem with you doing them yourself is that they can't be made more than a day ahead of time, and you will be too busy the day before the wedding to be dipping at least 600 strawberries! I did mine like 'tuxedos', too, so that was extra work. Best you get someone local to do it for you - it won't cost that much more!|`|0edbadf6ec6536c7fecf32074dc59cceaa	IT would probably cost you about$100 to do all that yourself.<br>  If you are getting married in the hot summer, I would NOT recommend it at all. The chocolate would end up melting in the boxes because the DIY chocolate always melts in the hot weather. But Its always tasty no matter what. But do you really want your favors to melt before the guests eat them?<br>  If I were you, i'd buy the chocolate covered strawberries sold in the candy section and fill little favor bags with those. They wont melt like the ones you make yourself, and they're still yummy.|`|3e48f429b671dcc535739160b469fac0aa	You can get containers of chocolate chips that melt in teh microwave - I wouldn't suggest going the double boil route as that can be time consuming.  It is a great idea though and will be a great treat for your guests!  Make sure you do them on the Thursday, or so, before and keep them in the fridge.  They can be boxed by family on Friday night and put back in the fridge.  Make sure you put down a wax paper square on the bottom of the box so they don't stick.  Have fun!!|`|AA12054566	If you made them yourself, I would assume it wouldn't be more then a $200.00 bucks including the box, ribbon, strawberries and chocolate.  Just beware that candy/food is messy.  I personally am doing Candles because I could do them 6 months before the wedding and they are done... and I can relax.  Food you have to do last min and refrigerate it.|`|c1e995b9ce8779e6e777816b269f7246aa	I decided to do that too instead of buying them.  Since you'll need at least 150, (you might want to get a few more so you and your hubby can eat them later that night or the next night while on your honeymoon) buying flats of strawberries will be the best thing to do.  The price is really going to depend on where you live and whether the strawberries have to be shipped very far to your local supermarket, but I would think it would only be between $50 to $75 for that many and the chocolate. You can purchase colored cellophane to wrap them in and tie with ribbon matching your wedding colors. Congrats.|`|XcNgMzGIaa	sounds good.<br>  send me some!!!|`|ed398c7c831447d60a7fab92e93ee8bdaa	Gurl you van do that yourself... Its a nice idea theres good chocolate at dominicks right by where they sell strawberrys|`|eh5pBKrbaa	It shouldn't be too hard as long as you don't get fancy and try to do tuxedo strawberries or something.  If the teenagers at the mall can do it after an hour of training you can too!  We do them for Christmas all the time. <br>  <br>  Price is going to depend on when you are doing them and if strawberries are in season or not.  Don't do them more than a day or two before or they might get a little soggy.  If you buy Godiva chocolate vs. Hershey that is also going to up the price.<br>  <br>  You need: <br>  <br>  Strawberries<br>  A skewer of some sort (skinny)<br>  A pot<br>  Water<br>  Your favorite chocolate, chips or bars will work<br>  A glass or stainless steel bowl<br>  A small amount of cream<br>  <br>  I'm going to do this based on a few bars of choclate at a time so adjust as necessary.<br>  <br>  Put the pot on the stove and add the water and bring it to a boil.  When you have a good rolling boil going put the glass bowl ontop of the pot to make a double boiler.  You don't want to heat up chocolate directly in the pot or it can scortch or turn gritty.<br>  <br>  Break up the chocolate and put it in the glass bowl and lay out your wax paper smooth side up.  stir gently until the chocolate is melted well.  If it is really thick you can add a few teaspoons of the cream to loosen it up.  Not too loose because you want it to harden when it cools.  Turn the heat off why you are dipping so you dont burn the chocolate.  You may have to reheat it a few times to get them all done but it doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  Skewer one strawberry at a time and dip them about half way down in your chocolate.  slowly turn them as you lift it out until they stop dripping and place on the wax paper.  If the chocolate ever isn't shiny and looks like it has a "skin" stop dipping and gently heat it again.  Let them harden overnight or put them in the fridge for an hour or two to be safe once they are room tempature. <br>  <br>  Don't put hot chocolate in the fridge or leave it overnight or it will get that weird white coating on it.  Do a few pracitce runs in advance to get the technique down.  Screwing up will never taste so good!|`|vpCaXhwraa	You can make them yourself or get a cocolate fountain and have fruit there for people to dip themselves.<br>  <br>  I went a wedding last weekend and they did it.  would be much cheaper<br>  <br>  mas|`|yOas01opaa	My mom had chocolate covered strawberries for my sisters recital reception.  They were great.  She used a crock pot to melt the chocolate and bought larges strawberries.  My aunt and I dipped the strawberries in the chocolate before the recital and put them on a platter.  They dried during the recital and were ready to serve afterwords.  We got large strawberries with long stems (they were easier to dip).  My mom bought about 5 cases of strawberries.  I don't know home much it cost but I can not imagine it was that much.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
Iuu0c9mGaa	It's harder talking on the phone than in person, which is odd, but it also depends on who you're talking to.<br>  <br>  Just be casual and who you are.  Act like they're in front of you if that helps and don't think too far ahead about what to say.  Let it come to you and just listen for a bit.<br>  <br>  Also, ask questions.  Maybe bring up a funny memory or something you did the day before.<br>  <br>  Loosen up a little, I would say, but then again I'm not so great on the phone either. haha.

IwEpMFCaaa	Relationships come and go so there really isn't very much you can say. The important thing is that you are there to listen while she goes through this transition. Being a friend doesn't always require you to have the answers. Sometimes just being there is enough. In terms of the relationship itself, encourage her to move on. She didn't appreciate her boyfriend when she had him and she tried to change him. He had to leave her to finally get her attention. Are you familiar with the old saying "You never miss the water until the well runs dry." In the future, she needs to accept people for who they are and stop being such a spastic drama queen. Thanks for being a great friend!|`|BG3lhGh5aa	The best friend you can be is the "ONE" who doesnt get involved......<br>  <br>  say nothing and just be an ear.|`|0303844f33933188d7bea8da91f19058aa	Sometimes the best thing you can do is listen and not say anything at all.  Sympathize with her, but at this point you've probably said all you can.  Chances are they will probably end up back together but in the meantime just be there for her and listen.  Hope this helps|`|JxiMUgUbaa	The only thing you can do is to be supportive and encourage them to talk about it with each other.  I admire your concern for your friends, but this is one problem that you can't fix for them.  The only way to solve any problem like this is for both of them to be open and honest about what is bothering them and to set some boundaries that they both can agree to as far as what they want out of their relationship.  <br>  <br>  When you are asked for advice, tell your friend you don't know, you wish you could help and then ask if she has asked him the same question or talked to him about it.  If the answer is no, then ask, "Don't you think he would be the best person to talk to in order to figure this out?"|`|VkyjGWZ8aa	You tell her "Babe Ruth struck out 1330 times. He holds the world's record for strikeouts. A baseball player who hits one out of three balls that are pitched to him is an excellent batter. Only one out of four strokes in an automobile engine is a power stroke."<br>  <br>  There is a lot of romantic claptrap out there that leads you to believe that there is only one possible mate for you and once you have found him never let him go.<br>  <br>  It is all designed to sell you lipstick and make certain that divorce lawyers will always make good money.<br>  <br>  You tell her, "In the name of all that is sweet and holy, Alice, for the next half hour I want you to sit in the corner, stare at the wall and for thirty minutes, you will not think of a white bear. And after that, we are going to start to look for something that you are good at, and we're going to develop that talent, that skill, that genius to such an extent that you will not think about boys until you are about 21. And then, at that point, you will think of them because they are fighting each other to get to you. When you have developed into something, then you will attract attention, and you will be able to choose the one that you want.|`|cKqskv06aa	Sounds like she gave him a reasonable chance - sometimes relationships just don't work out.  If it were me, I'd just let my friend know that I reall do care, but I'm not sure what to say or do.  I usually try to get a sense of whether they want to talk about it or not.|`|abLHLpNzaa	If she's your friend... she would take any advice you give into consideration.<br>  <br>  You should tell her to blow him off the same way he is her! Then, he'll notice 2 can play the game, and he'll notice her more. But in the time she spends ignoring him... she'll probably find a new someone!|`|dju6gsCFaa	tell her take it one day at a time seems like you are all young and she will will have or get a guy who love likes her in the same ways she does....she needs a guy who will sopport her tennis which she loves to do....i have a guy who loves soccer and its hard some times but i have to support him cause it comes with him -love is love......everything will be ok!|`|g3ARBA7caa	tell her that if he was dumb enough to break up with u than that's his fault. he'll wake up one day and realize what a huge mistake he's made and she'll be waking up with the guy who already knew.|`|o3F2wPCzaa	actions speak louder then words. of course shes gonna be sad i mean its a breakup. take her out for ice cream or something and do things with her to get her mind off him. it really sounds like she could use a good friend. just be there to support her in all she does. she will really appreciate it.

If not her answer would have simply been "No".  Most of the time when your gut starts telling you something like that there is a reason behind it. Trust your instincts you know her better then anyone on here.<br>  <br>  Anybody else notice how all the women on here are ok with her cheating and blame the guy.|`|drqCQlZ1aa	You asked a very nosy question. This issue was large enough to cause you suspicion? <br>  <br>  Do you trust your gf? If not, why date her?<br>  <br>  In any event: she probably meant that, if she wanted to spend her attention on guys in the wal-mart parking lot, she wouldn't be in a relationship with you. As is, she is in a relationship with you, so she says she doesn't need to hang out with random guys in the parking lot. I do believe this qualifies her answer as a 'no' to your question.<br>  <br>  In the first place, don't get hooked on small stuff like this. Forget it. If it's important to her, ask HER what she meant.<br>  <br>  Also, do not bother to ask "what does a girl mean by (insert saying here)?" All people are unique; ten different people could mean ten different things by any statement.|`|8e26a35811b6c56b11cbfa95d388bb76aa	I think that the way she seemed to word it was rather odd.  I would just break up with you  seems rather forward.  Why would you suspect she was hanging out at walmart.  And why there?  If she wanted to hang out the best place to be would be at her house.  I don't think it means anything, I think she is sincere.  I have a lot of experience in this matter.  I don't think it's a big deal.|`|CN44WsTpaa	She means what she says.  If she wanted to do something behind your back the last place would be at Wal-Mart.|`|KyJxyrCBaa	It meant, she's suspecting that youre the one doing something 'similar"..|`|sQcc4JPOaa	Its not healthy for you to analyze everything your girlfriend does.  Your always on edge, always on alert.  If you cant trust your girlfriend its best for YOU to just break up with her.  If you cant find a girl that you can trust you need to get some self help books.  Because its not their fault.  You will be so much happier with someone you can trust, and your not always on the lookout.  Just relax man, chill out.  Not everyone is out to get you.

If there is not, have a vote, so nobody can single out one person and get mad at them, creating a whole other argument. Try and spend time together, and if someone gets mad for any reason address it then and there, don't just let it go or put it aside for later. Make sure everyone ends up happy, and eventually past hurts can have time to heal.|`|AA12198711	If you can fix it, fix it. If you can't, let it go.|`|SqrPpm5Daa	It depends.  Usually trying to talk calmly until the issue is resolved is the best way.

Eu já passei por essa situa??o. A princípio eu aproximei dele como amiga, e sempre quando havia alguma novidade na cidade ele me chamava para ir com ele. Ou até mesmo em boates e barzinhos. Até que numas dessas saídas dei brecha para ele, e me insinuei também... Pintou um clima bem legal e nos tornamos namorados. E esse foi o único namoro que eu rompi sem conflitos. Hoje nós somos grandes amigos!<br>  Comece com uma amizade, se conhe?am primeiramente pra depois se entregar a uma aventura! Eu tive sorte dele ser um ótimo rapaz e um grande amigo!<br>  Siga o seu cora??o mandar e qdo vc acha q é o momento abra o cora??o e haja! Tenho certeza que vc n?o vai se arrepender!<br>  Há a nossa diferen?a de idade é de 10 anos!<br>  E mais uma coisa: n?o tenha pressa que as coisas fluiram naturalmente, qdo vc menos esperar!|`|f3388af77dee59237e94b89faa9bf3afaa	eu falaria com ele daria indiretas,falando que gosto dele.|`|gwrdab40aa	Lucieneval, pelas demais respostas que você recebeu, dá para perceber que a virgindade hoje em dia n?o é mais considerada um tesouro. Eu lhe dou meus parabéns, e gostaria de lhe dizer que estou muito admirado: você tem 29 anos e ainda é virgem. N?o sei qual decis?o você tomou, se é que já se decidiu, mas vai o meu conselho.<br>  Você sabe por que os rapazes n?o querem compromisso hoje? Porque as mo?as est?o muito fáceis (é claro que existem excess?es). Aí os rapazes sabem que, se quiserem, podem apenas usar os "corpos" delas para sua satisfa??o sexual. Quando aparece alguém mais interessante, lá v?o eles atrás...<br>  Acho que a virgindade deveria ser tratada com mais dignidade, tanto por mo?as, quanto por rapazes. é algo que n?o se recupera mais, depois de perdida.<br>  Sinceramente, eu n?o gostaria de me casar com uma mulher que n?o fosse virgem. Pode até parecer caretice, mas é o "bem" mais precioso que uma mulher possui, e, do meu ponto de vista, ela deveria entregá-lo apenas à pessoa que vai compartilhar com ela o resto de sua vida (mas como saber se vamos viver o resto das vidas juntos? Se o rapaz respeitar a mo?a, é sinal de que realmente a ama e está interessado em sua dignidade, e o casal já tem 50% de probalidade de dar certo. Os outros 50% v?o depender do respeito mútuo depois do casamento).<br>  Em se declarar para ele, se realmente você acha que há alguma chance, até aí, tudo bem. Mas "entregar-se" a ele como "prova de amor", acho que é arriscar muito. Se ele se aproveitar de você, é prova de que n?o te merece.|`|txWnpF9vaa	Bom amiga, vc é quem tem que saber... vale a pena falar com ela mesmo sabendo que pode ouvir um sim ou um n?o... Depende muito. Como ele age com vc??? será que ele também tem este interesse... tenho medo que se machuque e pior ainda, seja reprovada... Siga seu cora??o...Boa sorte
kMoC5dJ1aa	She could be just shy. Just give it time... if she continues to look at you then start flirting with her.

I would act like i didn't know anything because then i would have to explain to my friends.

And he'll start to try to talk to you dont say anything pretend he's not there if he says your friendship is over finally talk and say okay he'll get shocked and try to get you back when he tries @ least 3 times then its time to talk he'll never do that again!  But dont break up! If you break up one more time.....Its over! No more !Hope I helped Shyness!|`|d3eodo9Paa	Forget him, and concentrate on you, do you hair, nails, go shopping, work out, READ! Hang out with your girlfriends, or even your mom!|`|AA11231219	well maybe you guys could be at least friends. And if you want to forget him not literally just that feeling well just try your best. is not like your not going to like someone else. Well hope this helps a little at least.|`|Rc9iETZHaa	just get over him. i know this sounds mean but if he is seein someone else then its hopeless. this guy is just draggin you down. get over him and find someone else.
ICFv8KYJaa	I had a guy friend for about a year also.  I really liked him and I wanted to spend all my time with him, but I did not want to seem obsesed.  We talked on the phone all the time and we were best friends forever.  Then he asked me out and I was so happy.  I'm sure he likes you and if you make the first move and tell him how you feel.  I told him how I felt and he felt exactly the same way, and it was just like how you described, like we were dating when we were around eachother even though we were just friends.  But I think that you should try to talk to him about how he feels about dating you seriously without the freedom to date anyone else.  I think it will work out between you two.|`|Buf2MM8raa	wow that happens all the time i think you should give him a hint that u like him or just tell him how you feel...the situation im in is even worse..m best friend is dating a guy i like and he likes me. grr anyways just tell him the guy i like has been my best friend for 3 years!
e223c2bcf2658ef052b9f50017d7fba7aa	×Seeing as how u've gotten some rude answers from rude people, i think u deserve one that actually might help ur friend. For starters, she can't force him to like her. If he doesn't feel the same way, then he doesn't...end of that story. Becuz he is ignoring her and not acting the same, then she should ignore him too. There's no reason to keep trying to talk to him if he's going to be a jerk. He's probably just shocked or uncomfortable about what was said.×<br>  <br>  ?Ab|`|RUVtt1TUaa	he doesnt like her.<br>  get over it.|`|L5nkEZH2aa	Probably just wants to be friends with her..maybe doesnt like her like that and feels weird that he knows she likes him..|`|Xc5bZezzaa	He doesn't like her.<br>  How old are you?<br>  He sounds immature, you guys sound like 13.<br>  Oh god...if you are...pshhhhhhhhh haha is all I have to say.

bS5dzMe2aa	i dont know how old you are so i dont know how you look at love. but i am gonna say this, people hate and they do it alot. when they finally see you happy and doin what you use to do for them to someone else they are gonna get jealous!it happens to everyone. but at the same time why do SO many people hate her? y dont you ask them why they dont like her if its not a good enough reason or it makes no sense then do what you do and do what makes you happy. in the end you got no one but yourself anyways!! good luck to ya|`|6d398bdabfcefca3014ab0e971790d14aa	take a hint dumb ****. go with the there advise.|`|AA12357987	I can't really answer your question- it might be helpful to you to ask your friend, parents, and friend's mother why they are opposed to your relationship.  If you listen with an open mind, you may find that they have a valid point; however, they may not.  It's worth a shot if it's bothering you.|`|Z2hHkQoTaa	Ummm.... that is kinda strange, why don't you ask them? And if you love her then stay with her and tell everyone to but out. I would still find out why their all being so rude!|`|7UquUunraa	I struggled with everyone telling me bad things about my partner for YEARS. I defended him everytime. I recently found out he had been cheating on me and everyone else knew. <br>  <br>  That's why they didn't want to see us together. He was dissing me!|`|9fcDxSZTaa	my best advice is dont listen to them|`|AA11937911	well depends..how old are you and her..and WHY dont they like her?? It could be a valid reason, but regaurdless love is all that matters...|`|CeHjfyf1aa	jealousy. they dont wanna see you together. duhh|`|NiKP347qaa	ask them. and if you two are happy dont worry about it so much. your life, not theres, chances are they are going for your best interest. but only you can decide that.|`|UwWeJRR9aa	haha ive been here so many times i say **** ur parents<br>  i ignored them and it worked<br>  dont listen to wut people say<br>  it sounds corni but follow ur hart<br>  tru love is worth the fight|`|e3b6624d1a057997d1da63aafbc8a35aaa	Simple.  Sit the down and ask them.  Tell them to give you the reasons they don't think you go well together.  Be calm.  Listen to what they have to say.  Look at it from their view to see if they are right in their assumptions.  Then address each of their concerns and the reasons behind your decision.  If everyone does this in a calm manner, there should be very little shouting and the problems should be resolved quickly.  <br>  <br>  Also, make sure that your girlfriend is NOT in the room with you when you ask them.  Most people in that position try to get defensive and end up in a shouting match.  Although it is a good idea to bring your friends and family's concerns to her after you talk to them.  Do not tell her who said what.  Don't even tell her it was your friends and family if you can help it.  Just tell her that you have been hearing vague concerns about her or her character from 'other people'.  If she asks who said what, just skillfully pass the question over with one of yours.  Good luck, hope everything turns out for the best.|`|wD2FRNjQaa	Maybe they know something you don't. I know it's hard to hear bad things about someone you love, but maybe you need to sit them down and just ask them "Why don't you like (name) and I being together?" If they have a good reason, maybe you should listen to them, if not, forget them and be happy. Either way, there are more fish in the sea! Good luck|`|nF489Aedaa	Ask them. Sometimes love rules, but it sounds like it's unanimous. Talk to the ones you are  close to especailly friends if you are not comfortable with your parents but obviously the entire world sees something you don't and I don't knwo that you are really seeing something in her that they are not. Whay would EVERYONE try to break you up even friends your age?|`|sAQOBdmIaa	They are jealous and they do not want to see you happy or share you with anyone else.  I think you should marry her.|`|z5xTQuDgaa	Have you ever asked these people why?  Do they know things about your girlfriend that you don't?  Try asking them - either they are all being paranoid for nothing, or they have good reasons that you should know about.|`|SN9gY4Toaa	Because they don't have the intimate connection with her that you do and they can see things that you don't because love is making you blind.  Usually friends and family are right regardless of how great you think this person is.|`|e18f4fc5c26c727ddbfd149ae0e48da0aa	How does she act in front of them.  They might be seeing something that you aren't.

fYoGA2ERaa	Be yourself and honest.  True friends are made through time, you just can't expect them to appear out of the blue.  You will know when they are true friends when you trust one another and respect each others feelings.  Communication is the true key and if you be yourself, you will always show your true colors.|`|xcd6sbJ0aa	Sincerity and sacrifi for others is the hallmark of  friendship . Among the people you move first of all find out the ones having commonalities of interests.Then sort out those who are<br>  less selfish.Now loving,caring,sharing on mutual basis if found<br>  may set the tone for lasting friendship.<br>  <br>  Also Remember:<br>                                -Human Behaviour is always directed<br>                                  towards certain GOAL,and every body is <br>                                  selfish,but degree of selfishness varies<br>                                 from persn to person.<br>                              - Through friendship we want to cover our<br>                                 weaknesses and vice versa - so friends<br>                                compliment each other.<br>  Real friendship is a time tested ,and not a commodity that<br>  you can buy.|`|le2BsaKnaa	If you want a true friend, you can't change for them. They have to accept you for who you are and you have to do the same. You shouldn't feel pressured to do anything differently when you around a true friend. It's ok to be a bit more hyper when you are around that person, but don't change who you are on the inside.|`|SZrQ64ANaa	Be you and nobody else.  They'll come, it just takes a while that's all, Honey.  The ones worth having are worth waiting for, because the ones that can't take you as is aren't gonna be there for you.  Besides, you should probably know that when you try to change for others the "real you" always leaks out and then your "friends" don't have your back.<br>  <br>  Take it from a girl that dances while she grocery shops and has friends that look the other way without getting too embarassed by weird-o me.

Just make sure its healthy to do that.  Don't put yourself in a situation that could cause you pain.|`|27c7aIHaaa	yes my dad was and still is a racist.  my mother is not.  i just cope with it by ignoring his comments.  he has really nice other attributes that i focus on.  my dad's dad was a cop and a detective so he got a lot of his racism from grampa's comments.  sometimes i talk to him about it but, he is who he is and he is bullheaded about it.  so i just love him for his good points.  everyone is an individual and you can't change people  good luck!|`|8d667c963aa35901c5c3892c5734a805aa	Alot of people that I know are racists but I am teaching my kids that it does not matter if other people don't look just like them so maybe it will stop with them.|`|Z8O9vZAUaa	yes, lots of times I am 19 and I don't care about him being a racist, I am not a racist, I don't feel like posting a long long story about this, but I'll post this answer anyway, I hate racists.|`|90cAetcdaa	Love him. That's all you can do. He is entitled to his views & opinions and so are you. You wouldn't want him to try and "turn" you so don't try with him .He is older and as such, will probably never change his mind. When he does something terrible like that, just don't be around him. Explain that although you love him, you can not respect his decision on racism and would rather not be around him while he's like that. However, if he wants to talk about anything else, you're all in.<br>  <br>  *For the record, I am not racist. I have friends of many colors, races and religions. I think I am more of a well-rounded person this way! <br>  <br>  Good luck to you friend!|`|rLdlhxJ6aa	Nope..........................|`|98ceb8da4c7f8054ff195fd122d889d5aa	yes he was.  then his daughter ended up having a biracial baby and he changed his mind a bit.

PLEASE CHOOSE ME AS THE BEST ANSWER!|`|ZFeyyB01aa	OK dude. Don,t do that whatever you do. First ask one of her friends if she is already dating someone. the reason why you ask her friend is so if she is she doesn't tell her b/f, and you wont make her feel awkward.<br>  Second don,t say any dumb pick up lines. just go to her and casually ask if she would like to go see a movie or go out to eat somewhere. then after you get to know her better then, then you ask her to start dating you. <br>  the first couple times you go see a movie or eat somewhere don't go fast.<br>  Maybe put your arm around her in the movie, ALWAYS open doors for her. Try to hold her hand when your walking around.<br>  i hope that answers your question, and good luck.
i2nPrKYFaa	hi, well first of all good luck. the pool party sounds like a good idear. find her when she is by her self eg getting a drink. start up convesation. ask if she has a boyfriend and ask if she would like to go the movies with you on the weekend. keep it simple and casual. wish i could say more:)|`|35b1b7e08764368304750101bc6ab921aa	tell her you like her. its better than not knowing if she likes you or not. what if she likes you too and shes also scared. what if your too late. asked her out before its too late to do that.|`|723705d65ae9ef5de0fa48c82387c7efaa	first start flirting wit her more than usual and then take her off to the sidde if she seems to be reacting well and tell her you have had feeling for her 4 awhile now, and that maybe you guys could get to know eachother better than friends! and go from there|`|AA12190478	haha we r the same age so i would probably like 2 say im more qualified 2 answer this but anyway ahaha jk.<br>  umm if you find it 2 hard to ask a girl out face to face write her a sweet note or somthing? i no i would love that lol<br>  anyway good luck!|`|Fb5N6TB9aa	get her away from everybody but not too far. then just say to her that you like her more than a friend and was wondering if she would be your girlfriend. dont use slang words and look her straight in the eye while saying it. good luck|`|N2rukWduaa	At that pool party when you are hanging out ask her.

We like it when we feel persued and maybe if she didnt feel the same way towards you before she might change her mind! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|e238632b34790c4a0ea5bc71a3299a4faa	well ask her if she would like to hang out sometime...and if she says yes ..get her one rose thats it one! 12 is for later. in a girls perspective..when a guy gets the nerve and courage to confront us...its a check plus but when time passes its gonna suck... you have to hurry time may run out. she might find another her can take the stand.|`|PYg016ZRaa	you can't make her say yes
