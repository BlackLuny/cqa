The word sad does not enter into the equation, nor does the expression "mistaken identity". <br>  <br>  You ask has justice been served that someone has been found guilty of contributing to the death of an innocent bystander? My answer, based on the information you have provided is -- yes.|`|vlOtkGu3aa	She is technically an accessory to murder.

AA11069376	If the Govt. is going to invest a gazillion dollars of taxpayers money into the banking system a full investigation is certainly necessary. The problems leading to the collapse of the banking system didn't start recently. There may be some evidence of fraud but I suspect the real problem is years, perhaps decades of incompetent management fuelled by greed. I  hope that the Govt would set <br>  parameters / ground rules as to how these financial institutions operate in the future, and also determine if the present management is even capable of due diligence.

The post sabarmati express fire Godhara riots were just incidents. The media had and have propagandised more than the real fact. There were no of Hindus  also killed in same riot but media never highlighted/ highlighting such cases because they are being paid by some anti national elements and parties.<br>  Do you know the fact after 2002, there is not a single any major incidence of riot happened in Gujarat and both communities are staying in Gujarat very safe condition.Do you know the history of Congress regime of 40 years ? If you even go trough the government records , every year of Congress regime there were riots in Gujarat.The policy of Congress remained always divide and rule and you even literate people do not understand the facts.<br>   I welcome you in Gujarat and see that any community person at any localities, he can move very safely with out security. I think Gujarat is the only state where any women can safely move alone at mid night.<br>  Please ask any Muslim in Gujarat how they are safer here than any other states?<br>  So better you people do not mis understand,  think positive and co operate with leader like Nationalist Modi instead of Cheater Congresses .

Whatever was done has a gr8 results check the history of Gujarat pre godhra and post godhra yes there is not riots this is possible only due to Narendrabhai. Further I want to slap u and all those who say modi as villein see this link even muslims of godhra are big fan of modi, why? Coz he has done something unbelievable development in gujarat.<br>  <br>  Now tell me why he should punished for no communal riots in last 7 years or great development in all aspects at Gujarat???|`|X5Xx15Y5aa	Brother, perhaps your thought process is developing towards the negative sides of a person, who is accumulating more & more public support at Gujurat. The public support comes from all religious group of people there. One day you will see this person as the PM of India. The Gujurati Muslims have realised the truthfulness, courage, sincerity, equality & brevity attitudes in Narendra Modi as CM of Gujurat state. For the reason the Pseudo secular politicians else where in India, outside that state, have been feeling & realising that, the era of playing their dirty partisan politics is losing interest amongst Gujurati masses. Hence, such types of vague non existent, falsely created stories are being circulated against one person. Thanks.
XHCoIo3zaa	It was definitely disrespectful.  No doubt about it.

When there's spending, there's income for everyone. With the kickback in the economy there's no consumer spending and there's gain in income; so its a long spiral down unless we increase consumer spending.

HCvJ0AGnaa	I was never caned at school, I was never hit at school.<br>  <br>  I have never broken the law in my life. I have respect for others, I listen, i'm compassionate and I treat others as I would like to be treated....<br>  <br>  This is for ONE reason only. I was brought up by parents that love me, gave me the basic morals of society and made me learn from a young age to respect those around me.|`|bYtCfdwbaa	Not.I went to two different secondary schools.One had the belt the other didn't.Discipline was much better in the one that didn't.<br>  Discipline starts at home and teaching a child through love,understanding,encouragement and guidance to attain a level of self respect is the key to bringing up a decent well behaved child.<br>  If anything has had a marked effect on discipline it is the fact that so many families are breaking down.Both parents having to go out to work and less time being spent with children has contributed to the decline.Parenting has become harder with the changing pace and demands of the modern world.<br>  <br>  Michael:Tad presumptive,non?I never hit my children nor would I let another human being.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	I don't think so.  I think the general standards of behaviour in society have fallen - people now think it is appropriate to swear openly, get drunk openly, be rude and behave in an arrogant fashion.  Manners make the man, and there's not many in our streets or schools.<br>  I think a good teacher can control a class without the cane, but there must be respect.  And it is this lack of respect that is the real problem.  We don't teach respect anymore.  We demand it for ourselves, but that's it.<br>  And again, parents don't support the schools.  If someone is expelled from school, there are appeals which often result in decisions being overturned.  <br>  it's too simple to say it is the cane - it's far more wide reaching than that.  Our standards and expectations are too low.|`|9ADVLFOnaa	I think a lot of it is lazy parenting, I'm a single parent and my son is well brought up and mannerly, infact the teachers at parents night said his behaviour is excellent, he's 14 but he has to put up with a lot of kids at school who do as they please and disrupt classes. I got the belt at school twice, the first time I was basically bullied by the headmaster and a male teacher into admitting to cheating when I had done nothing wrong but in the end I said I did it just so that it would be over, I was only 7 or 8, the next time was for talking in class but the teacher who did it was firm but fair and I accepted my punishment and still had respect for that teacher. I think the power has been taken away from adults and given to children and it's about time we took control again, I wouldn't object to my son getting the belt if he was in the wrong but there is always one teacher who will abuse it so it's a bit of a double edged sword. But it really is time the adults in this world took charge again.|`|0NcRUSCoaa	I would agree with that.  I never got the cane, but I often got a ruler across the back of my hand.  It never did me any harm and taught me not to give cheek.  My primary school was run by nuns as well and they were really a force not be reckoned with-but their harshness taught me to respect others.|`|N0TuYFQIaa	caning is wrong, that's a form of torture,<br>  but the belt never did me any harm, and i got it often enough, deservedly so,<br>  but ye, it's up to the parents the way the bring the kids up.|`|FP49kXBsaa	no I do not agree, violence breeds violence , what you should do to punish children when they misbehave is take away their most treasured luxury|`|9GbPZUTXaa	In that case why don't they cane their own children rather than off load their responsibility to someone else.|`|cKtyAmATaa	The cane was horrible, and so abused by certain teachers, no, the cane is not the answer, the key is respect, or lack of it, the parents have no respect for the teachers, if a child gets told off or punished at school now the parents take it personally, like the teacher is picking on them.  Parents should back the teacher, even if they think it is wrong, they can take that up privately with the school, without their childs knowledge.  Children learn to who to respect by their parents behaviour towards those in authority, if they show no respect, the children will follow.|`|5gKg5S0vaa	My father has the same opinion.  He believes that behaviour has worsened because children who are not receiving discipline at home would get discipline from the teachers at school but nowadays children who are neglected and undisciplined at home are left unguided and teachers are disrespected because of this.<br>  <br>  Some people are so dramatic! Terrorised! My parents smacked me when I was younger and I believe a healthy fear breeds a certain amount of respect, not a fear of my parents but a fear of the repercussions if i was naughty.|`|dYGLyVpzaa	I don't think its the cane in particular, I think its the whole change within our society thats caused worsening behaviour. The risk of being hit by a cane wouldn't put a lot of kids off behaving badly nowadays. Its not punishment we need, its a change of attitude towards education - simply, I think people are taking advantage of whats being given to them. Education is a real value, I think people need to learn to appreciate it more like they used to :)|`|wLGrgBobaa	The thing is, if they had it in our school the kid would just phone his dad up and the dad would come into the school and batter the teacher. Now the teacher would most likely end up being stabbed if he whacked a chav twat. That's how it is nowadays, they can't reverse it and expect the same results. The damage is done. You can't take away discipline, let it get all relaxed and then suddenly bring it back and expect people to take it. Also, some of the teachers would end up abusing their power and start using it to vent their frustration or just because they can because some teachers are arrogant bastards like that.|`|s8nPN7pVaa	Damn right it has!<br>  <br>  Mind you, the ones that disagree are most likely the very same parents that abrogate their responsibility and then blame everyone else when their kids turn into yobs.<br>  <br>  Edit.<br>  Wasn't this forecast 20 years ago?<br>  <br>  Edit 2.<br>  Well I had children at school more than 30 years ago, and my youngest is at university now.<br>  Fortunately I have had no real problems with mine, however had the headmaster / mistress felt the need to chastise them .. my full support.<br>  <br>  The term in loco parentis, Latin for "in the place of a parent" or "instead of a parent," refers to the legal responsibility of a person or organization to take on some of the functions and responsibilities of a parent.<br>  <br>  QED|`|TDVIb4SBaa	Well is many many years since I was at school we had no corporal punishment then,it was far worse to get a black mark and have to stand in front of the school at assembly your peers were your judge.<br>  These days  parents seem to think school is the place to instill discipline, well I disagree parents are the ones who should be doing this and sending well behaved children to school, it is nonsense these days what parents expect the state to do.We do not cane murderers so why children ? they have rights as well it is the parents I would cane.|`|mNi2N6ULaa	Yes and since the unruly children of the eighties became parents. Badly behaved pupils tend to go on to have children who are badly behaved pupils. When parents have no respect for school their children won't.<br>  These parents complain if their child is punished in any way and are quick to challenge the authority of schools and teachers.|`|2d4d4d8f449f8266d3033948651354acaa	How many people had kids when they had the cane (20 years ago) and still have kids in school now? <br>  <br>  It is a typical right wing gut reaction based on nothing but right wing gut reaction.<br>  <br>  I would agree that behaviour has got worse but the cane has nothing to do with it.|`|cVDllJddaa	people will always use the same argument that they were hit and they turned out ok, that could well be true but i am certain it wasnt the hitting that contributed to there future well being and equally certain that it was more to do with other skills such as the ones that zoe louis (previous answer) parents obviously had and taught. Its a fact that kids that were caned turned out good and bad and also a fact that kids that were not caned turned out good and bad, my argument therefore is that caning a kid bares no significance to their future behaviour and upbringing , i was caned and i turned out ok although i suffered depression and a few other issues directly linked to my school life , it went untreated for many years as i just got on with it , i turned out alright because my parents were the kind of people Zoe louis describess in another answer , i would have been the same without the physical discipline except i may not have suffered some of  the emotional turmoil i went through . We all have our opinions but i feel so certain that physical violence teaches nothing .|`|ffc2e6d63c3d0e7bd58b65ae3981c966aa	I don't think kids these days would stop doing something they shouldn't be for fear of getting the cane. in fact they'd probably want to get caned in front of the class to show how hard they are by pretending it doesn't hurt|`|92hLSlJcaa	Yes, it has.

The behavior of the world has gotten worse since the end of WW2|`|AA10700407	as a parent and a former teacher, the discipline has to start at home.  if the parents don't make the children mind, the teachers can't do much.  the kids do as they please for the first 5 or 6 years and don't want to listen to anyone.|`|15bjtZhzaa	Well the proof is out there.<br>  Children are behaving in a worse way, at home & at school.<br>  The truth is there is probably more violence at home & in the streets than there ever was at schools.<br>  <br>  Pupils are now bashing each other up at schools & taking pics of bullying, which they then put on internet sites.<br>  Society is going down the tubes, not just at school.<br>  There are no spiritual values, no respect & no discipline...at home or at school.|`|S8RL9lieaa	As a regular visitor to the headmasters office, I became immune to the cane and to be honest I think he was bored with doing it. That was me, but the very thought of it was more than enough to stop the other kids from following in my footsteps. I don't agree with violence as it only breeds contempt and to my way of thinking another solution has to be found. Isolating kids isn't the answer either, but the reason why they feel the need to act disrespectfully must surely start at home.|`|FO1XCZc4aa	This is a difficult one as I often think parents can be inconsistent with discipline of their children and part of me thinks authority like schools could have had a more consistent approach. One the other hand I do not like the thought of anyone else physically disciplining my children. I am a firm believer in spare the rod spoil the child and some parents get emotionally manipulated by their little darlings.<br>  Unruly and disrespectful children need to have a degree of fear for consequences, whoever that disciplinarian is. <br>  I would be in uproar if there was talk of it's return and I  like the current system at my kids school...if they get a red for behaviour at school it is me who deals with it on behalf of the school just like my own upbringing.

Once socialism<br>  is full swing, you will see a new form of government in this country<br>  comparable to the cold war Soviet Union.  People wouldn't pay any attention when they could do something about it, now it is a little<br>  late to think about it.  Our right to own fire arms is swiftly becoming a<br>  thing of the past, we will be so deeply in debt with the rest of the world<br>  that we will be forced to sway in their favor on anything they want from us.  There is no way this country can come up with the kind of money<br>  this 'stimulus BS' calls for, it has been running on promissory notes<br>  far too long already, true silver certificates and gold backing has been<br>  turned to paper promises and now can't be backed up and the outsourcing of domestic jobs will cripple the economy for a lifetime to<br>  come and longer most likely.  So back to the government owning everything, don't worry a lot about it other than another more powerful<br>  government owning this one and we, being a once proud freedom<br>  loving people, now the slaves of state!

They are convinced that the "Radical Left" is going to take all of their weapons.  As though there aren't more weapons than people in this country.  Not too many people have a problem with responsible use of weapons for hunting or "defending their family", but when they're used to commit armed robbery, murder, kill "enemies" on the street or shoot Cops, it's awfully hard to defend that that's what the forefathers had intended in the second amendment.  Who else would so staunchly defend the right to bear arms except someone who is completely paranoid that one day we'll have a hostile overthrow of our government and they have to be ready to become militia men and women and defend the great Constitution of these United States so that we can all be free to own guns to use in any manner we choose.|`|nkA5NMUsaa	to keep your butt free from government oppression,the same reason we defend our nation from foreign oppression.i wish there was someway to not do it but you would just agree when the time comes and we'll have to save you too.|`|dGiYVfw6aa	Not everyone can legally have a gun.

Personally, I don't agree that people should carry firearms or have such easy access to them.  There is too much temptation to use the weapon in a panic or, in some cases, as some sort of revenge against somebody who has hurt you in some way.  There has recently been the case of an 11 year old child who had access to a gun and shot his father's pregnant girlfriend.  How did this child even know how to load the gun, let alone have access to it? To my mind, we are living in a society where guns are being given out like candy.  I think people forget just how dangerous these things are.  It just takes one squeeze of the trigger and lives are ruined forever.  Sadly, in the case of that 11 year old, squeezing the trigger has also ruined his life...and all because his father was overly casual with a gun. Interesting question.|`|YenjChuWaa	ok I have an IQ and i am a moderate, but the statistics show that an armed society has less crime and murder rates<br>  <br>  it is not the gun that kills, it is the person<br>  <br>  Hitler took away the guns from the people and then killed millions<br>  <br>  Stalin took away guns from the people and then killed millions<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Founding Fathers said that the society should be armed as THE FINAL CHECK AND BALANCE of the nation so that a revolution would be possible under an over-bearing Federal Government.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  think about this- if you were a criminal would you want to break into a house where you do not know if the person is armed or not, or would you like to have the advantage to break into a house where the law says there are no guns<br>  <br>  <br>  also banning guns makes it go underground just like when Alchohol was illegalized during prohbition<br>  <br>  <br>  For example, District Of Colombia , all guns have to be dissassembled, it has a high crme rate, higher than average and that is the capitol

Any company that doesn't should be named publicly.<br>  This way jobs will remain in Australia.|`|UETAqR8Taa	Its a disgrace. The sacked workers aside - as you obviously dont just SUDDENLY decide to make off shore. The workers unfortunately wont gain anything out of this. The other looses are the sharesholders. This huge increase in salary should have been split amongst the shareholders. The downside if you hear me out, is if a legistration is bought in (as it should be) will deter large companies moving their headoffices or manufacturing plants TO Australia. But all in all it is a sad day for Australia|`|lVKwnFvjaa	The Government should blackmail them:  "re-instate the workers, rescind all executive pay rises and continue manufacturing in Oz, or we will legislate to force you to pay back all Government grants paid to date, with interest calculated at the highest rate applicable over the years the grants were received".<br>  <br>  I doubt the Libs would be game even to try and block such legislation.<br>  <br>  Edit: And as Macka above me suggests, boycott the mongrels' products.|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	That happens all the time, and yet there is no law to penalize them.<br>  <br>  The wealthy look out for each other.|`|QKnPbJ6Daa	That's outrageous!

However, I do feel that the entire scenario should be considered in total. In this instance we have an entire manufacturing chain literally abandoned,with a total workforce skilled and willing to resume the operation of this machinery just waiting on the sidelines. I feel personally that the "Free market approach and unfettered internationalised manufacturing" has failed Australia and all Australians it is time for our Government to step in and do what we elected them to do. In other words purchase the entire chain (less the money already paid to them from the public purse) nationalise the workforce and start to support Australia in the manner it used to. If the Government finds this too difficult for their intellects ask yourselves why we gave them the entire country to run?<br>  We are about to start to pay these workers from the dole chest, how much extra would it cost in order to achieve some production. We would make up the difference between the dole amount and their wages by selling what they manufacture. In order to continue this proud Australian business would cost us nothing|`|VsaEOX9vaa	It's nasty, but the decision to go offshore was made 2 years ago.<br>  <br>  You can't blame just Bonds, Australian companies (and American companies) have been doing it for years, cutting out manufacturing in the home country and importing from Asia. <br>  <br>  If I was a capitalist shareholder (and no one is a shareholder unless they are a capitalist) I'd agree with the disgustingly paid CEOs. Who on earth is worth 29 million dollars a year? This is what Sol Trujillo (an American), CEO of Australia's publicly-owned telco, Telstra is paid. Plus, can you believe, a bonus of several million per annum!<br>  <br>  These CEOs are so brilliant, they say " we can save billions of dollars a year by sacking 4000 people and sending all the work offshore". even I can work that out, and I dropped out of high school at age 15! If I employed 10 people I'd soon work out that I could save a lot of money by NOT employing them and farming out their jobs to somewhere cheap. How much brain does that take?<br>  <br>  Pacific Bonds have been importing most of their clothes from China for years, anyway. Their CEO now being paid $1.9 million per year has recently made TV ads saying how "Australian" Bonds are! What a joke! I won't defend her, but I'll say "stand up" the shareholders who allowed all this to happen.<br>  <br>  Almost every Australian I know searches high and low to buy "Australian Made" and I'm sure people in US are the same.<br>  <br>  Yesterday I bought a tub of crab meat that was covered in info about how good the American Phillips company was at sourcing their locally-caught seafood. I assumed in was made in USA, when I searched high and low on the packaging I saw that it was made in Indonesia!<br>  <br>  It's all a big scam and a bit profit-making excercise for the shareholders. Now the world is getting its own back on the shareholders and the value of their investments is dropping like flies into a bottomless pit and I have no sympathy for them whatsoever.|`|Lx6TXgHKaa	They should be sacked and the business should be sold.|`|wiMEyNApaa	Maybe is they didn't get such huge pay rises they wouldn't have had to sack the workers.

0NcRUSCoaa	I agree with you.  I really like "Crimewatch" and I find it very interesting, but I thought the whole premise of the programme was to solve crimes.  I suppose showing how "Crimewatch" has helped to solve crimes may encourage people to phone in and see that a call can go a long way, but they should have a separate programme for that sort of thing.|`|AA11049477	Agreed.<br>  I'm also relieved they've dropped that ridiculous <br>  Don't have nightmares...........<br>  <br>  If we actually knew how many harden criminals were NOT locked-up, <br>  out on bail & promptly done a bunk, tagged with a self-regulated curfew, on probation, day release pending the end of their sentences <br>  ( actually that's a lie, they have years left to serve but prisons are over-crowded & it's against their human rights to lock-up 2 to a cell )<br>  Those habitual repeat offenders that got a police warning, another last chance, a measly token fine, accepted a caution.....<br>    <br>  We'd never leave home!|`|ko9Zy9k7aa	Agreed.<br>  <br>  That case with the face modelling was great how they solved it, and the technology; it was really interesting. <br>  <br>  However, like you said, crimes which have been solved should be a whole other programme. <br>  <br>  If they want to show the public the solved crimes, then we should have more than one episode of Crimewatch a month. I mean, they had like 4 unsolved cases on there. When they could actually fit like 10 cases into an hour show. But they drag everything out. They need to be sharp, quick and to the point. That way more cases get solved.<br>  <br>  Xx|`|QqXpkatHaa	Yes...it is a bit annoying - especially when people from one of many council estates throughout the land have had to deal with crimes for nigh on a generation.

rCYIWvwraa	What would Cinderella do?  Would she inform her wicked step sisters of her dilemma?  Maybe confide in her wicked stepmother?  Or would she just stay home and clean instead?  If you've been preparing for your debate for over a week, you have obviously invested a lot of time and effort in wanting to do well.  The hair modeling thing sounds nice, but you're probably very beautiful already, so what's the point of the fashion show?  The debate sounds more of a challenge, not only for you as an individual, but as a promising student that could possibly gain far more from your debate than you would from a fashion show.  The fashion show, although provides a more relaxing and enjoyable experience for you, doesn't sound like a challenge for you that you can really benefit from.

But to even imply that he sought Publicity is not a very nice thing to say.We all feel sorry for any child that dies with these terrible things    that they were born with, and I am sure we all are thankful that our children are born ok.I was a Driver with my Car taking Children to disabled Schools, and all of them are most loving children, and you can tell that in their own  world they are happy little children.It was one of my happiest jobs that I ever had, and I loved everyone of them.|`|bYtCfdwbaa	Here we go!Sheesh!<br>  <br>  The man lives his live in the public arena and decided to let the press in to his family life for very pertinent reasons.Yes he was hooray Henry,yes he'd had a privileged life but disability knows no boundaries and here we share ,all of us,a common bond.If Ivan's passing alerts us all to the difficulties faced by sufferers and their families then society as a whole moves forward.David Cameron was brave enough not to shy away from press intrusion in order to highlight the difficulties faced by families with children of disability so I reckon he and Ivan warrant their day of coverage.R.I.P. Ivan Cameron.<br>  <br>  Well said Shady.<br>  <br>  One further point:Everyone who has a child with a disability does not have to live their life in the public arena.They share all the same pain but get to do it in private.It will not go begging the fact that the Camerons will sacrifice a certain amount of privacy in this most tragic of times in order to highlight the plight of others.Have the good grace to afford them some appreciation.|`|GOifC7i3aa	how is it biased?<br>  <br>  he is the leader of the opposition....he could be our next leader<br>  <br>  he has a young family and sadly his six year old has just died<br>  <br>  lots of people have disabled children...true ...but how many may become the leader of britain?<br>  <br>  parliament stopped because he is the leader of the opposition and strangely the prime minister also lost a child...<br>  <br>  if you ever had a child die ...or come close to death you might have more compassion<br>  <br>  children of parents in the public eye get more coverage if they go off the rails too....politicans children who break the law make the news, but lots of kids who break the law do not have that sort of unfair attention<br>  <br>  celebrity and fame brings both wanted and unwanted attention.....think about it|`|046668252b7d273d3a4a3a6908a8607daa	A child has died- can we not just feel sympathy for his parents instead of looking for a reason to whinge? If I had my way, we would be made to see the news of every single child's death on the TV but that isn't going to happen so let's just pay tribute to Ivan Cameron and his short life without any complaints. Obviously, he is no more or less important than any other child but his death is newsworthy. He is the child of a man who is famous in the UK.<br>  <br>  Also, did you not consider that the coverage on Baby P was not as intensive because the TV companies were legally not allowed free access to all the information?|`|Uz16kQEYaa	FFS! This man is in the public eye daily,,of course the press are going to tell the story of his little boy. My friends son died,he got media coverage from the day after he died til the day after his funeral.<br>  My son was savaged by a pit bull,he got media coverage for 3 days.Madeleine McCann got it from day one.<br>  Your question is just like the Jade Goody ones,,'nobody else with cancer are getting media coverage' .<br>  I really wish some people would grow a heart instead of the swinging brick they have in it's place!!|`|AA11015890	Why on earth are you making it into a contest?  Just because Cameron's son died in hospital with his family by his side, it doesn't make his death any less tragic.  Baby P has nothing to do with it.  The death of any child is a tragedy and you should not be making comparisons.|`|EEpBrsSnaa	I disagree with everything you say and I would like to refer you to this question asked earlier today.<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmqaJsfa.dJgxbC4qBH7GeUhBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090225021650AAFiMLH&show=7#profile-info-f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  Thanks|`|bdb0448285000d5895d1e8ed364a94fbaa	There was massive coverage of the baby 'p' issue and I'm quite sure David Cameron and the rest of the family would be very glad not to have this tragedy splashed over the media.<br>  <br>  Sorry but I don't agree especially as the baby 'p' coverage is still going on (quite rightly too) until we do take the needs of vulnerable children properly.<br>  <br>  If anything the fact that Ivan Cameron lived for 6 years in a loving family shows that disabled children can be a wonderful bonus and personally I have huge respect for them as people for loving a child as just that a child regardless of his 'abilities'.<br>  I feel humbled by their actions because I have not been tested by such events and I don't know if I would have the strength, love and courage needed to cope.<br>  <br>  May God bless Ivan and all his family and YES all the children who tonight are going without the love and care they need and deserve.|`|Y46YE1e2aa	David Cameron and his wife I am convinced =they= do not want any publicity over the tragic death of their child, to publicise this to such an extent is a terrible thing to do,<br>   These are two parents in deep grief,just as any loving parents would  be at this time.unfortunately, David Cameron is in the public eye through his occupation.<br>  ,The media once again are on the war path, =nothing new in that=.when stories abound decency flies out the window.<br>   Mention is made of many other children die yes, that is so, and the nearest and dearest will also grieve for them<br>  +.Muffinis+ I did in my answer refer to, the media and their blatant indifference of any tragedy for a story.|`|3a1d98e5d06e33a288cfd5d40b0c4470aa	You raise a very good point, but the loss of a child is tragic at all times. In both good and bad times. The Chinese have a good saying, it is difficult to meet, yet it is more difficult still to part. <br>  <br>  Why do some people receive more attention than others. In my words I call it Karma. I felt that way about the little girl in Portugal, I forget her name. Pretty blue eyes and blond hair, lovely parents, millions were donated and invested to find her. In my mind I think of a dog, pregnant with 6 puppies, dumped in the river Test with a heavy metal chain around her waist to ensure she would not resurface. Made me sick to the stomach when I read that. They promised they wouldn't stop searching, until they found the 'murderer(s)'. Not another word since.<br>  <br>  I guess people perceive good or bad news in their own way, just as the victims who carry the burden of loss, must come to terms with their situation. In this case, the boy was severely disabled and they were fortunate to have 6 years with him. He was a happy boy. His Father is a politician and with a high profile. It is natural that he receives public sympathy. People can relate to him as a person and to his loss.|`|689c455122b340827462328d4ec387d5aa	For one no it isn't the baby p story was huge. Secondly the system is hugely complicated in which ridiculous laws prevail over common sense. Which is true as my mum is a health visitor and has several friends who are social workers.<br>  <br>  What makes this big as the NHS is completely against the founding principles of the Conservatives and the fact that David Cameron is a big figure in the UK, and I say that as a strong Labour supporter.|`|gYgXn2weaa	So how do you decide how news coverage is shared out? You cannot make comparisons with these two extremely sad cases. You are bringing abuse into this and that is downright stupid. What, apart from death, do baby P and Ivan have in common, absolutely nothing. The kids that die due to parental abuse have been let down by the community and Social Services plus, in baby P's case, 1 NHS doctor, that does not make the NHS responsible for all child deaths through infanticide. Show some genuine compassion for the Cameron's, whether you like them or not, as any dead child is one too many.|`|TDVIb4SBaa	Oh dear even a child cannot die without nastieness prevailing.<br>  His father is leader of the Tory party as such it is news,I am sure David Cameron would not wish this story today is only newsworthy because of that .<br>  Really why even question this Cameron nor his dead young son did not ask for this coverage.<br>  Please Let decency prevail in here <br>  RIP Ivan|`|e29dd74974bc25d59aabc8139b00731caa	how can you say you're not nit picking? the country has not come to a standstill. we cant have every child death in the news but this one is important as he was the son of the future  prime minister. its news. live with it.i david cameron and his wife have done nothing wrong and you are being very unfair. i hope you never lose a child.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	No-one is saying that no other children have died or that Mr. Cameron's son is more important than any other child.

xZwwb3kVaa	Talk about Pensions for the boys, when they have not even earned it. This Government have a hell of a lot to answer for, the way they treat other people who have worked hard all their life, and not had cushy jobs either. They treat us with contempt, and it is us that keep the Country going. This lot with their big handouts do not know what a hard days work is and then be treated like second class Citizens.I bet they did not do sixty hours a week on munitions, for four pounds a week, with a bonus of a few shillings if you did over your target.Nor did they continued working after the war for paltry wages.No chance to save a few pennies to help you when you get old, so you end up on the scrap heap.

aGcRB3pyaa	I was a single father, and when I got custody of my two children back in 1975, it was very difficult.<br>  There were lots of support groups and organizations for single mothers, but precious little for single fathers.<br>  It is slowly changing in that there are groups for single parents, however the media and most peoples thoughts are still surrounding strictly single mothers, when a single parent is mentioned.|`|66eKcJE3aa	You make excellent points and I totally agree with you!!  Congrats for giving kudos to the many men out there raising their kids with very little recognition that they are everyday heroes!! I think men have to work a lil harder to be the primary parent (only in the sense that women TEND to be more maternal and nuturing, certainly not in EVERY case) so when I see a single Dad being the single parent and head of his household, it warms my heart. Sooo many deadbeat dads out here, but not all dads are so thanks for giving them a pat on the back! :)|`|TDVIb4SBaa	Yes I agree and the trouble is fathers are often targeted incorrectly as well as not being able to cope so they sheer away from seeking advice and help ,we are in the UK and it is the same here.Sometimes I do get angry at the type of stigma given to a single dad as though they are not as capable as a woman of raising their children.indeed better a loving father than an uncaring mother.|`|zBH0rGJOaa	It's the same in the UK.  It's all about single mothers - no mention of single fathers.  There is general feeling here that men are somehow not able to bring children up alone.  Well, they are - my own father bought my and my brother up singlehanded from babies.  No help, no state benefit, no nothing.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	I don't think the media overlooks it, no. There is much more negativity associated with being a single mother than there is a single father. A single father will usually be applauded, where as a single mother will often be assumed to be on welfare. It's also not as common for fathers to be single fathers, because woman don't have the option of leaving during pregnancy. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying single fathers don't face the same difficulties as single mothers. Just that they don't have the same prejudices, and the situation isn't as common.

His notion that the car had to be affordable to the people who built them was an important factor in it's success.  The Model T was reliable, inexpensive and easy to use.  It was fed gasoline instead of oats and was reasonably economical.  The cost was kept down by producing them en mass on the assembly line - a concept he created.  You could have one in "any color you want - as long as it was black".  He knew how to design, plan, build, market and maintain his product.  He could wear every hat and he often did.  He also built a strong network of dealers for distribution of his product.

It was just how it was.  I liked the beads she had in her hair.  At that very small age, I had no prejudices and so it would not have occurred to me to think there was anything unusual about a black woman on the telly.  I suspect that the kids who watch the lady with the one arm think the same way.  It's the parents who have the prejudice.

Wendy provided us all with great entertainment over the years. <br>  <br>  One thing that did upset her a lot was the common mistake everyone made by putting an "s" at the end of her name. She hated it.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	I agree with you entirely. We each have the right to choose, and Wendy's circumstances and Jade's are entirely different.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	i am sure the last thing wendy richards husband and friends are thinking about is max clifford at the moment the man is making enough money off  poor jade goody and kerry katona|`|gYThMID8aa	So sad.<br>  Not sure who Max Clifford is but I found him in my dictionary under; "Odious!"|`|y3b1X671aa	I'll always remember her as Miss Brahms from "Are you being served?" Shame that.|`|QqXpkatHaa	Max Clifford? Come on...she's dead, which means there's no dinero in it for him.|`|q5BkV27Daa	Yes they do, finally a nice posting.|`|nxrEuJsRaa	whats important here is that we have lost a real British treasure to cancer.<br>  I hope Wendy has found peace. I will miss seeing her on our screens
U2tx9gDHaa	Yes yes yes and yes. Well said.|`|TKDi70uTaa	i totally agree, i think the only way to save ourselves in the uk is to introduce the death penalty. not just for murder either, possession of an unlicensed firearm should also carry the penalty along with other offences. none of this death row crap for 15 years either 2 weeks from the sentence you are gone. a campaign of intense advertising by the government just so everyone realises what they will be executed for and watch the crime figures fall. i will apply for job of executioner as well.|`|nxrEuJsRaa	Yes,we are way too soft on crime.<br>  You can rape someone and get 2 years<br>  You can kill someone by being drunk whilst driving and just get banned for driving for 3 years<br>  You can microwave a kitten and get a suspended sentence<br>  You can download child porn and get 6 months maybe<br>  You can be a seriel killer and get a nice life sentence,maybe get a degree in prison,get counselling,find God...<br>  <br>  If they wont bring back capital punishment then people ought to be sent to hard work camps out in the desert maybe.They should be suffering more for their crimes.The victims and their families certainly are
