20060616155613AAsymg8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Lately i have been waking up with this funny taste in my mouth. I do think i'm pregnant .?	I have read up on a metallic taste existing in some pregnant women. I was wondering about what time in pregnancy does this start to occur? I've never had this taste before. I wake up every morning with this. I've been experiencing this for the last 3 weeks. Could i be over exaggerating or could this be something else?

I blamed not getting that one on stress.  July, still no period.  So now I'm worried.  I began to spot a little on Aug 2 (pink, then brown).  Today's the 4th and still the light spotting.  I haven't needed any other protection besides a pantyliner.  I've been having frequent mild cramps, some worse than others.  Is this implantation bleeding?  I took a hpt Aug. 1 and it's negative.  Since I haven't had a period in over 2 months, I can't track ovulation.  If anyone can help me...i usually have a 29 day cycle.  Please help.  Oh, my boyfriend and I have sex regularly 2-3 times a week, always unprotected...so I am "at risk" for pregnancy.  However, this is the first time I've ever missed a period....the 2 months scares me.  HELP!!!!

For your information just because some teenagers make the mistakes of becoming pregnant at such a young age doesn;t mean that they are not going to be great parents.  To let you know I was a teenage mother I got pregnant at the age of 15 and had my child when I was 16.  I am still with the father.  I was not on the welfare system even though I was a teenage mother.  My husband and I both have excellent jobs and are great parents.  The only thing we have to do now is stress the fact that becoming a teenage parent is not easy at all.  Our oldest is ten now and we stress this information to her all the time now because kids are starting to have sex at a younger age now.  Just thought I would bust your bubble.

Yet at the hospital one nurse slipped and referred to my husband and I as older he is 30 I'm 26. This is our first she is 3 months.  I feel old when I come on here. Is it just because I'm on yahoo? or do you feel women are having kids early now a days? Why do you think it is? Is it the way of the new generation?       I don't want anyone getting the wrong idea. I see no problem being a young parent in many ways it can be better.

They said it was and in complete miscarraige and my body was getting rid of the rest of the stuff that was left inside me. So I went through another week and a half of bleeding and severe cramping then stopped bleeding (the doctor again said I didn't need a D & C and could do it naturally).   So now AGAIN I'm bleeding like I was at the beginning of February (a LOT of blood, not like a period at all, it's like straight blood coming out) but I'm not cramping at all (yet, that could start later though).    Should I call the Doctor yet again only for him to tell me it's fine and I don't need a D&C?? I've been miscarrying longer than I was even pregnant and not only is it stressful and dissappointing because it's hard to get over when I wont freakin stop bleeding, I also can't get pregnant again till this stupid stuff is done.    What should I do? Anyone in the world been through something similiar? I keep reading questions saying they only bleed for one or two weeks one time then go back to normal. This is so stressful....:(

20090227141937AAySuN4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	How accurate is a gender scan at 16 weeks?	I was at a regular prenatal appointment and they could not find the heartbeat with the doppler so they did an ultrasound to check on the baby. My actual Dr. is the one who did the scan and said that he may be able to tell the sex. The baby is fine with a perfect heartbeat of 150 bpm ( knocking out any old wives tales because our little one is smack in the middle!) When we got down to the business side of things he saw nothing that would indicate a boy and said if he had to guess he would say it is a girl. I am just curious how many of you had similar experiences and the doc was right?

I found her myspace and we talked on there for 2-3days and I finnaly got her Aim Account, we been talking on Aim for 2 weeks and I really never know what to say to her in class so I dont. But yesterday on Aim we were just talking and she had to do an essay and I offered to help so I did a bit, then in class I said hey whats up and she replied, then I asked did you finish the essay and she gave me that smurk/smile girls do and said no in that weird ways girls do.       And just a couple sentences more we talked. But I always find that she is looking my way I sit right next to her but it seems as if she is looking out the door as if she heard something I dont know..       Does she like me? And I find I always have to start the convos on aim, is she shy or what? Im confused         The few things iv said to her in person I felt PERFECT.. Like some other girls i talk to I tend to blush and what not..      And What do I talk about, Hellp! I have no idea what to say! I really like her! I dont want to mess it up!      Today I was in class and she kept looking at me, I could see her looking at me at the corner of my eye and when I go to look at her she turns her head.. She did it all day today in both class's         And Since I sit literally right next to her and the door is all the way on the other side (to the right) I dont know.. and in my other class i sit diagnoally behind her.. She like turns her body my way and looks and then I see her in the corner of my eye and then she turns away         On aim sometimes we really get into it, but most of the time she just gives me shitty answers... Is she doing this on purpose.. Wtf is going on

20070427232410AAjL9JZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Has anyone had a decrease in symptoms before 12th week?	My nausea has died down to just being a little annoying and my breasts are not as sore as they were either and the streaching has stopped. I am 9w 5days now and this is my 5th pregnancy . I have had two full terms. No spotting with this one and I have seen the HB twice on US.       My gut says everything is fine but I also think I am deluding myself. So I want to know has anyone else had this happen and everything be fine.       So I am 2 for 2 and I feel like I am in limbo. they said that they will not try to find the HB till 12 weeks on the doppler. So thats May 17th for me 20 days from now... I dont want to give up but I want to know if I should be guarded. I felt this way with my second MC and I lost her (10 week sac and 6 week baby) I am beside myself right now. Left to the hands of God and I have no knowledge. He knows I cannot take another loss. I have been questioning my abilities as a mother and I would take the loss very personal. Even though I know I had nothing to do with it.

20070429011535AAaMxNL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	I haven't had a period for almost 2 yrs and had unprotected sex and got my period. I thought I was pregnant...	I had what I thought was implantation bleeding and I took several tests and all came out neg. I had all the signs of being preg but just not the BFP. I then began my period, very heavy with clotting and cramps and I was wondering if it was still possible to be preg and maybe possible that my uterus was ridding the excess lining that had built up. Could the baby implant itself if the uterus is congested? I would be 7-8 weeks and still no positive. I was wondering if it would take longer to build up hcg in my system because of my not shedding the lining during my period. I have been ovulating (I have a microscope to confirm) and I do get pms symptoms almost monthly just not the bleeding. I was just wondering what the odds could be to still be preg. I am ttc and was wanting advice. I was so for sure  I was preg when I had the tender swollen breasts because they are never tender even with pms or a period. My mom didn't know she was preg until she was 4 mth, she had 3 girls all at 6 mth. TY

20070621094516AAEfxhi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Pinkish/Brown spotting a week before my period?	Ok, I have been ttc for several months now, and I am trying not to over analyze ever little thing that happens to me, but last night I noticed some pinkish/brown spotting(this is a week before my expected period), and this morning a noticed a bit more, It now seems to be tapering off (it was never very much just some staining).   Like I said I'm ttc, so I have been off birthcontrol (the pill) for about a year now.  What I need to know is could this be an early period starting or maybe implantation bleeding, or could it be something else.   Wish me luck, and thank you to any who give an answer.

Já tive um aborto espontanêo com 8 semanas e 4 dias e agora estou grávida de novo.No ultra som que fiz semana pasada só deu pra ver só saco gestacional segundo o médico muito pequeno para o tempo que estava (5mm com 6 semanas e 1 dia do atraso menstrual) e farei outra dia 27/07. Hoje de manh? comecei a ter um corrimento que é semelhante uma chara de ovo só que com tom marrom bem claro e hoje a tarde saiu um bolinha preta de +- 1mm, poderá ter sido o embri?o que foi expelido ou o embri?o só sai junto com o saco gestacional? N?o tenho dores fortes somentte umas  fiscada as vezes. Estou muito preocupada e vou ao médico amanh? de manh?. Mas a noite  é longa e estou muito ansiosa por qualquer informa??o pois fico apavorada em pensar em outro aborto.

20080325220759AAUTj4A	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Period...but i think i'm pregnant?	My period last month was Feb 18-23. I was'nt taking my birthcontorl then. But here lately....like for the past 2 weeks i've been extremley nauseated, but never vomited. I got cramps so bad one day last week i could hardly move. I'm always tired. And all of this started about 2 weeks ago. Yesterday i finally started my period, and that was when i took my first birth control pill. My period is normal as can be, but i really think i'm pregnant, because just a while ago at 12 my mom and i and her friend went to go eat, and after we walked out of the mexican resurant, I smelled this awful smell, and just started throwing up. Not alot. And it did'nt happen all of the sudden, i bent down next to the car, and then about 30 seconds later i threw up. Then we went to walmart right after that, and i still felt sick to my stomach. Looking at all of that food, just made me want to vomit, and i knew i had to. So i went to the bathroom and puked my guts up. Can i have a normal period and be pregnant?

20081031141117AAffalA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Should I give up or keep hoping?	OK so my LMP was 10/6 I ovualted 10-14 / 10-15 (early I know) anyways I have had moderate cramping for about 4 days now and am not due to start AF till monday I took a test yesterday and today neither were first urine and it came back negative. I also am very sensitive to smell and had a day about 6 dpo that I was very tired and sick. I have 2 kids and feels almost exactly as I did with my first. I feel prego but am skeptical. I never get cramping until about an hour before AF comes to visit. My boobs look like road maps but are not very sore so is it that maybe I am physically changing and its PMS? HELP Just need some reassurance :}

My doctor wants to induce labor because i am an hour from the hospital and my first labor came rapidly (under 2 hours) he is worried i won't make to the hospital this time around. I don't want to be induced i would rather my body go into labor naturally and i hear (some cases) contractions are stronger and labor could last longer with induction. What do you think? any personal experience with induction?
20081112092204AAUAqMv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	For the sake of the children, do you think language should be censored on television?	Or do you think it is the parents responsibility to make sure their child is watching things like South Park, Family Guy, American Dad etc. ?         *Note: I grew  up watching Alf and recently bought a dvd for my 12 year old son thinking he would like it. Funny enough, once I actually started watching it I was surprised my parents let me watch it, but maybe  they had a relatively good idea on the whole thing, we laughed because they laughed, not because we understood a thing that was on it.

20081119182048AA1kg8b	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would you use your children to get at someone that you don't like just because they have tried to be helpful?	For the past year and more my daughter-in-law has been grooming my eldest grandson (ten) to be rude to me and insult me repeating things that *she* has been saying at home (for instance he told me that I was "past your sell by date" a few months back and also told me to "shut up" in front of her without her reprimanding him in the least).    This all started when I suggested that she worked part time and put her children before her "career" because I used to take the boys into school every morning and fetch them at night and had the little one all day too before he started at nursery.    When my brother died last year I needed a break to recover and she *did* then find alternative arrangements but she resented it.    Since then I have been having the boys on a Friday night and during some of the school holidays but I find the eldest being more and more rude and it is affecting the younger two also.    I have mentioned it to my son but he says to leave it be but I can't for the *children's* sakes.    Now she is being petty.I used to give the boys a birthday tea but she has banned that and moved their birthdays to the nearest weekend! - well with the eldest anyhow.    She is now talking about taking them away at  Christmas (to *her* Mothers who smokes like a chimney around them - I mentioned that too and she cares not a jot about the health hazards) and that would be the final straw.    Would you use your own children in such a manner just because someone else put *their* welfare first and suggested that working all of the hours that God sends is not good for them?    They are ten,nine and four and used to be so happy before she started this nonsense.    I am sure that thye are being deeply hurt by her treatment of me - especially the eldest as he doesn't really understand what she is doing and my middle one is very sensitive and picks up on things (he has been having nightmares about it I am sure).She also puts her "work,work,work" ethic on to them and makes them sit doing homework even on the weekend and when I objected she went crazy.Again my son says to leave it be but I cannot and need to find a way to help the poor little mites before their whole childhood is ruined.    Any suggestions welcome.
