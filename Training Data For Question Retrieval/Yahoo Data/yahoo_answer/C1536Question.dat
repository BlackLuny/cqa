20090226101040AA9rSSe	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Do you think Most Asian/Japanese Cute sweet Women are Bi and could be Convinced by Butch American Women?	Some of you may have seen Japanese show or seen real Japanese women in your city. And maybe you have noticed how many Japanese look cute, frail and shy. I dont know, but for some reason I think many of these Women could be bi and that ANY Butch lesbian girl from America could be sweet and nice and start conversation and   slowly those Japanese girls would have no problem falling in love.      Since Many Japanese don't voice their sexuality as much as Americans do, many of them that we think are not Lesbian, may actually be.       So i'm just wondering that perhaps the majority of the Japanese that come to America or to other countries may be Bi or Lesbian even though you'd think they are not.

20090226101719AAyMNzS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If in Islam there is no "original sin" how do you account for the OT & the killing of women & children?	In the Old Testament God orders the Israelites to kill every living thing, man, woman, child & animal.  Arguments amongst scholars, theologians & others have contended that God knew the hearts of these people to be slaughtered because there was no good in them. This might be true for men & women, but how then do you explain an infants death? or a goat?  According to Islamic law if an evil (or sinful)thought is not acted upon it then becomes good.....I am confused here.    Important:  This is not a "Baited" question.  I am asking sincerely.

20090226102551AADABzD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are some Christians parrots?	I ask this because when certain topics come up, they repeat the same verses. But if you are going to do that, shouldn't you at least make sure they are correctly translated?      Lev. 18:22 and 20:13, in the Hebrew text, speak about a woman's bed. They do not mention any sexual activity.       The Hebrew text of the OT, as well as all the ancient Jewish commentaries, never suggest any connection between Sodom and homosexuality. (The Quran was the first to suggest such a thing.)      The Hebrew OT does not contain the word Sodomite.      The word effeminate is not found in the Greek text of 1 Corinthians.       The word that some Bible translate as homosexual in 1 Corinthians and 1 Timothy has a feminine ending, suggesting it is speaking of women having immoral relations with men.      Jude 7 does not talk about going after strange flesh, as the KJV says, but going after other flesh... and the Greek word for flesh is also the word for meat... which could well be a reference to cannibalism, which was known to exist in Canaan.      That leaves only Romans 1. It's translated properly. But most people who quote it ignore the historical context, and as a result, get the wrong message from it. That's bad scholarship at best.      So people, please, stop repeating like parrots, and do some study... and I don't mean Strong's concordance... even the letters of the Hebrew and Greek alphabets are wrong in there.

20090226103455AALQwbk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A few questions for Atheists....................?	Isn't the theory of Evolution the theory of how people, animals and plants have evolved throughout the millions of years? Not about how life came to be?      And isn't the theory of Abiogenesis about how life came to be?      If both of these are true why try to argue that God did not create us because of Evolution. That's like comparing apples to oranges. I believe it is possible that God created us and we have evolved massively from the time of our creation.      I haven't heard much argument from Atheists supporting the theory of Abiogenesis. Why? I'm not doubting you support it, but why not give more details to Christians if you are trying to prove that God does not exist?      This is not meant as a rude question, so please no rude answers. I am just curious.

20090226102709AAALMjz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Was the biblical god insane?  Please read it all before answering.?	According to the Bible, in the Book of Genesis, Biblegod created from mud and/or a rib, presto-chango, the innocents named Adam and Eve, and placed them in the middle of a wondrous playground called "The Garden of Eden". These two were literally babes in the woods. They would have been a hundred times more naive than any three year old around today. According to the story in Genesis (there are two contradictory ones to pick from, by the way) Adam and Eve were without any "knowledge of Good and Evil". Anyone could have told them to stick their hands into a fire, and they would have innocently done so without question or hesitation. In other words, they were the proverbial "blank slate" when it comes to gullibility.       But why is this the way it was? Christians claim these two were created perfect, with no faults or shortcomings whatsoever, and it was only thru their "free will" that they screwed things up;  yet they suffered from the fault, the imperfection, the defect, of being gullible. Where did this intrinsic fault come from? A perfect being, such as Christians claim Adam was, would not have made an imperfect choice, otherwise he wouldn't be a perfect being. Who therefore, I wonder, would create beings with the built-in fault of being gullible- unless the Christians want to argue that being gullible is a virtue and not a vice? Of course, Christians praise being gullible ("unless one become as a little child...") and many televangelist base their business on Christians being gullible, but few would come out and call being gullible a virtue. Adam and Eve then, suffering from massive amounts of gullibility, were obviously NOT  perfect, for perfect beings would not have been created gullible, and therefore would not have fallen for what the talking snake said. So much for the Christian claim that Adam and Eve, and not Biblegod, is to blame for the fall. Biblegod stacked the deck, created defective creatures, and set the whole row of dominos up for a fall. But I digress, back to the Garden of Eden...      What did the "loving" Biblegod set in the middle of their playground to catch their attention and arouse their natural curiosity? Why, nothing short of something guaranteed to kill them, and not only them, but every single one of their descendants for all time and eternity. Of course, he wasn't totally without normal human emotions- he did care enough for these two little kids to at least warn them not to taste the poison. Of course, having embedded the poison in a bright and shiny container rumored to look, smell, and taste just like an apple, some may doubt the sincerity of his warning to the kids.      After placing the poison, Biblegod left the playground, but he didn't leave the children unattended. He's too good of a loving parent for that. In his stead, he left his best friend Satan there alone with the kids, while he went off to hide in a bush and watch what was about to happen- that's how sick this god is. Of course, Biblegod being Biblegod, he knew exactly what was going to happen anyway, but he wanted to watch it in "real time", just for the fun of it. And yes, Biblegod could have stepped in at any time to stop the impending tragedy, but that just wouldn't have been as much fun for him, would it?      So there is Satan, all alone in the playground with the two kids, having been left in charge by Biblegod. Satan, the "Prince of Darkness", placed in the playground with the full knowledge and permission of Biblegod. It was certainly a top billed fight, a boxing match of epic proportions. Satan, the slickest "used car salesman" of the universe,  --vs-- two trusting, innocent, sweet children. So Satan, disguised as a snake, walks up to the kids (snakes have legs, according to the Bible) and manages to sweet-talk the kids into eating an apple, in which poison had been hidden, NOT by Satan, but by the loving Biblegod himself.       Was this a fair fight? Did Biblegod do right? Millions of Bible Thumpers "think" so (Bible Thumpers actually don't think, they obey. "God Said It, I Believe It, That Settles It"). Was it fair? Even Bible Thumpers would have the common sense not to employ Satan as a babysitter for their own kids, so why would they justify Biblegod doing the same for his kids? Because... they don't think.      Anyway, after the kids took the poison, Biblegod came out of hiding- not to give his kids an antidote, like any normal parent would have done, but rather a lecture- in actuality, a curse. He proceeded to curse Adam and Eve from here to eternity, up and down, blaming them for having eaten the poisoned apple that he himself mistakenly left out in the open. But it wasn't a mistake, was it? He knew all along what would happen- making it nothing short of premeditated murder

I know I need to forgive but I guess my question is once you have forgiven someone does it mean you never feel any more anger towards them for what they did to you and that you should forget it? Or does it mean that if you still have anger towards them that you really haven't forgiven them. I guess what I'm trying to find out is what should the end result be when you forgive someone?

20090226102031AAjyuYz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Believers, do you always follow the word of God (10pts)?	When people who don't proclaim to be willing to die for certain beliefs most believers (Protestants, Catholics etc) answer to everything is "well bible verse so and so says....".  So my question is pretty simple, when do YOU decided to take the bible literally or merely something to read and think about?  Example: what if my neighbor covets my wife.  Should one forgive or covet his right back?  What about the whole "eye for an eye" thing.  I don't know if the bible says that only God can think that way or not, but if not then explain when it would be okay to do something back to someone else.  And does it literally mean eye for an eye?  He killed my brother so I can kill his.  "Thou shall not steal".  Well even if I was an avid believer (which it's fine to be if you are, no disrespect intended) I'm also a realist and if my children were literally starving in the streets I'd gladly steal an orange from an orchard or something.  According to the bible I'd still go to Hell, right?  "Honor thy mother and they father".  Is there any leeway in the bible for not honoring a mother or father whom beats or molests you?  Just because I don't believe doesn't mean I don't want to understand why others do.  I want to know what you THINK (with your own minds) not hear what you've READ (with your own eyes).  So 10pts for sure for the best non "bible verse so and so says" answer.

Killing      Kill People Who Don't Listen to Priests          Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death.  Such evil must be purged from Israel.  (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT)             Kill Witches          You should not let a sorceress live.  (Exodus 22:17 NAB)             Kill Homosexuals       "If a man lies with a male as with a women, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited their lives."  (Leviticus 20:13 NAB)             Kill Fortunetellers          A man or a woman who acts as a medium or fortuneteller shall be put to death by stoning; they have no one but themselves to blame for their death.  (Leviticus 20:27 NAB)             Death for Hitting Dad          Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be put to death.  (Exodus 21:15 NAB)             Death for Cursing Parents          1) If one curses his father or mother, his lamp will go out at the coming of darkness.  (Proverbs 20:20 NAB)          2) All who curse their father or mother must be put to death.  They are guilty of a capital offense.  (Leviticus 20:9 NLT)             Death for Adultery          If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, both the man and the woman must be put to death.  (Leviticus 20:10 NLT)             Death for Fornication          A priest's daughter who loses her honor by committing fornication and thereby dishonors her father also, shall be burned to death.  (Leviticus 21:9 NAB)             Death to Followers of Other Religions          Whoever sacrifices to any god, except the Lord alone, shall be doomed.  (Exodus 22:19 NAB)             Kill Nonbelievers          They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.  (2 Chronicles 15:12-13 NAB)             Kill False Prophets          If a man still prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall say to him, "You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of the Lord."  When he prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall thrust him through.  (Zechariah 13:3 NAB)             Kill the Entire Town if One Person Worships Another God          Suppose you hear in one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you that some worthless rabble among you have led their fellow citizens astray by encouraging them to worship foreign gods.  In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully.  If you find it is true and can prove that such a detestable act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock.  Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the street and burn it.  Put the entire town to the torch as a burnt offering to the LORD your God.  That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt.  Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction.  Then the LORD will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you.  He will have compassion on you and make you a great nation, just as he solemnly promised your ancestors.  "The LORD your God will be merciful only if you obey him and keep all the commands I am giving you today, doing what is pleasing to him."  (Deuteronomy 13:13-19 NLT)             Kill Women Who Are Not Virgins On Their Wedding Night          But if this charge is true (that she wasn't a virgin on her wedding night), and evidence of the girls virginity is not found, they shall bring the girl to the entrance of her fathers house and there her townsman shall stone her to death, because she committed a crime against Israel by her unchasteness in her father's house.  Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst.  (Deuteronomy  22:20-21 NAB)             Kill Followers of Other Religions.          1) If your own full brother, or your son or daughter, or your beloved wife, or you intimate friend, entices you secretly to serve other gods, whom you and your fathers have not known, gods of any other nations, near at hand or far away, from one end of the earth to the other: do not yield to him or listen to him, nor look with pity upon him, to spare or shield him, but kill him.  Your hand shall be the first raised to slay him; the rest of the people shall join in with you.  You shall stone him to death, because he sought to lead you astray from the Lord, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that place of slavery.  And all Israel, hearing of this, shall fear and never do such evil as this in your midst.  (Deuteronomy 13:7-12 NAB)                 2) Suppose a man or woman among you, in one of your towns that the LORD your God is giving you, has done evil in the sight of the LORD your God and has violated the covenant by serving other gods or by worshiping the sun, the moon, or any of the forces of heaven, which

He was diagnosed with cancer in early October, yeah, it was really quick.    He passed away on Sunday at 1:30 am, and the saturday right before that day, he was unresponsive all day. Besides for one word.   My uncle took his hand and said, 'Kirk, if you die today, have you accepted Jesus Christ as your savior and know that you are going to heaven?'   My dads response was Yes, the only word he spoke on his whole last day.   I've been waiting for him to visit me in my dreams, for him to tell me that he made it and that he is alright. But, he has never come.    So my question is, how come I aint had a dream about my dad? Will i ever? Can you have dreams of deseased people?   Thanks, and please no smart a*s remarks.

Computering and Drawing.         Well what i mean by drawing [for me] is backgrounds, and mainly Anime/Manga, and ive also approached such answers that say, it is haraam when you think of it as being equal, or, perhaps, better than Gods creations himself.   Not once have i thought that, and never shall i, i've thought threw all this time, as it being a hobby, and because i can draw anime fairly good, i thank God for my capabilites.      Is this a sin? If  please explain.. I Don't know what to do with my future, as i've already decided my plans. I hope God will forgive me,  inshallah, for any mistakes done throughout this.

20090226105807AA3lRuF	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why are we responsible for protecting people that cannot or will not protect themselves?	Let's start with the fact that I have a huge amount of respect for anyone that is willing to put their life on the line in defense of another.      My question is this, why shouldn't people be responsible for protecting themselves?      I am neither a thug nor a convicted felon. I work extremely hard to get everything that my family and I have, so I am in no way looking to victimize anyone whatsoever, and still I am no respecter of the law. I respect God, but not the law due to the fact that it is so corrupt.      I would also like to point out that the police cannot help you until you are already a victim.      I have never called for police assistance and I never will. I know what it is to put my life on the line at work and have survived more than most here would believe...that is why I ask, why is it my responsibility to spend my tax dollars protecting people that cannot or will not protect themselves?      It is my responsibility and my responsibility alone, to protect myself and my family, not someone else's. When I meet my end, I will be a man about it and not "cry" for assistance.       Why can't everyone be this way?      Actually, I have studied martial arts since I was a child, and have competed professionally in MMA. Does that make me tough? More importantly it doesn't matter if it does or not, the point remains the same...people should be responsible for themselves.      It isn't "vigilantism" to protect one's self, family and property. I think that the police are woefully incapable of doing that when it comes down to it, which is my point. If they were capable of it, they would be there before you dialed 911, but they can't be. They are nothing more than a clean up crew, but that's not their fault.      Why do we need them?.

I would like to visit Japan someday. However, I've heard that immigrants that are non-white are allowed in but not really accepted by MOST of the Japanese since, as a society, they place great value on lighter skin. Also, i have 2 friends living in Japan. My peruvian friend grew up there and my black-american friend has been living there for 2 years now. Both seem to confirm that there's a lot of "silent" racism towards non-whites.       I'm not trying to base an opinion of Japan since i havent been there yet, but it seems a lot of people who are non-white immigrants residing in Japan seem to share these thoughts.

20090226105807AAYYGwL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should we force preachers to say God is only a hypothesis?	The Discovery Institute and other "fair minded," "moral" evangelical voices (including our former president) have for years sought to "teach the controversy" about evolution in school science classes.  Among relevant scientists there *is* no controversy in the sense the deniers want us to believe; the overwhelming majority of biologists consider evolution as factual as just about anything in science... but for the sake of this question I won't let that discrepancy trouble me any more than it troubles the Bible thumpers.      They want, at the very least, to force science teachers to say that evolution is "only a theory" which in the vernacular of students would imply it's no better than a guess... an egregious and often purposeful misrepresentation of science.  (Hmph... I thought lying was a sin.)  Science teachers are, understandably, staunchly opposed to watering down students' education, and to mixing religion into public education.  The creationist efforts are repeatedly shot down in courts across the country.      Of course there *is* controversy among the uneducated populace regarding evolution, a situation the Discovery Institute use to back their clever phrase.  If science isn't certain, what could be more reasonable and balanced, people agree, than teaching the controversy?        Well I want to be equally reasonable and balanced.  So should we take all this fair-mindedness to the next level, and drag the message of science into churches the way the evangelists want to drag religion into science classes?  Should preachers be forced to mention abiogenesis and evolution as an alternative to creation?  Should they also "teach the controversy?"  Let's be fair.

20090226105556AAJVx6c	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What is the ideal woman (body wise)?	I want to know what does the average person thinks is the ideal woman's' body. Although not a good source of information, but I typically hear on blogs people talking negative about every celebrity especially women and their bodies. It is either she too skinny or too fat, her butt too big or too flat, her waist too wide or her ribs are showing too much. Or I hear her legs too skinny or too chunky, her breasts too big or too small. It almost seems no female celebrity fits the ideal unless it's Charlize Theron. Charlize Theron is the only celebrity I never ever hear anyone say anything negative about. I do agree that she is very beautiful but I have my own ideals about the best body and hers is not the best to me.      Tell me what do you guys and dolls think are the best female bodies in entertainment. That would mean this person would have the total package, almost perfect.

So there's this really handsome guy in my English class. Now keep in mind, before this semester, I always used to check him out in the library and I think he kinda knew and always sat in the same place but I am not sure. I acted overly nice when he approached me once so I don't know. I saw him hanging around girls last semester but this year he doesn't anymore. Anyway, we finally have a class together and he sits in front of me towards the side and I can sort of see him looking at me through the corner of his eye sporadically throughout the class. Occasionally, he'll completely turn his head and give me a look. One class period, he had his whole body toward the side so he didn't have to turn and look at me out of the corner of his eye a couple of times. Today, when we got up, we looked at each other and he smiled and I smiled back.

20090226105518AAOiScM	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	HELP, RELATIONSHIP/FRIENDSHIP QUESTION?	Ok so I've known this guy for about year, everything was good. In the beginning he was like, he wasn't looking for a relationship ( not ready/stable I guess) and I was like "whatever" on the whole thing. If I got into one, I got into one, but I wasn't searching for a man. So, as it progressed, we both stated that we had an attraction for one another, and by this time, I was wanting a little more, maybe towards the last 2 months I was thinking of wanting more.I didn't tell him that, but he knew that I had started to have some sort of feelings for him. Anyway, We flirted a bit, but we were just "friends", we talked a little sexually a bit, however, we were still "friends." It was a very odd thing that was going on between us. There was never any force on my end. I probed him just a bit to see where his head was and that was about it. Later on, he saying things like "these are things that should only matter to the two people..." (it was a trust thing), he sorta tried to turn it around on me, but I let him know that I wasn't going for it. He'd say things like "you're the only person who can pick up my phone." and that talking to me is refreshing and that it makes him happier... yada yada yada and I'm like WTH??? You're confusing me! He asks me if I have other males that I speak with, blah blah blah...AND then just recently, maybe around the end of January, I get no phone calls for about 2 weeks and I'm like ok, well maybe he's busy, then I start to think, NO, if he can't just text a hello...Then around early Feb, still no call, so I "fake text" a friend and "accidentally" text him, FINALLY he responds and we have a really nice little chat! ok, that was Feb 10th. I call on 13th, only to learn his phone goes straight to voicemail and continues to do so ever since, BTW he uses his cell for his work, cuz I don't think he has a landline. So, this wasn't typical of his behavior (not calling, straight to voicemail etc...) so I text him a couple of times and I sent him a couple of emails because I was concerned. He finally responds to my email saying he's just "busy" with school, yada yada yada (who hasn't heard that one?) and that it's good to hear from me... By this time, I'm like what the hell is going on? In my email I explain to him that I was concerned about him (his well being), but I also mention that I feel like something is really off about all of this, of course he doesn't respond to ANY OF THAT, lol. So, my being confused, his fickleness, and feeling like I'm second fiddle to everything else. I told him in an email that, if he can't jet off a hello every once in a while, then it's safe to say that maybe he wants out of the friendship, that he either takes me for granted or just doesn't see our friendship as a priority and I said that if any of what I've said rings true, I told him to take care of himself, because I don't have the time nor the patience to deal with fickle friends, but that I'd leave my door open should he decide otherwise and that lately I'd been feeling as if this was going one-way instead of it being a two-way street.      My question in all of this is WTH happened???? and did I do the right thing? Will distance make him realize his mistake of pulling away? He's a really great person, despite his ambivalence about things. IDK, I just want some feedback. BTW, we live in different states.

Yeah... my girlfriend is bi and doesn't see it as cheating if she hooks up with another chick. Personally I think it is because she is sharing a very intimate experience with someone besides me. At first she wouldn't even consider letting me join in at all - ever. Lately she's been saying she MIGHT consider a threesome with me, but there'd be some heavy restrictions... basically I wouldn't be able to touch the other girl and the other girl couldn't touch me.... So really it'd only be fun and interesting for her because she gets to play with a guy (me) and a girl at the same time... meanwhile I get to watch her get ****** by another chick.

It is currently Lent, and Roman Catholics have to refrain from meat on every Friday during this time.      I asked the question as to why, and I didn't get one answer the same.  These are what I had heard:      "People love meat so they have to not eat it for one day."      "Because you have to kill an animal to get meat and you must not kill anything the day Jesus died."      "I think it has to deal with old Jewish Kosher laws and the Catholics continued it."

Right now, the reason we have godidiots is because it's been a part of our culture since the dawn of time.  But if a whole new society began, by a colony of confirmed atheists, would this spontaneously generate again?      Personally, I'm inclined to think eventually it would.

20090226135353AACPQzn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	When a Creationist says "There is no evidence to support evolution", shouldn't they put an asterisk next to it?	saying "that is, no evidence which I agree with", since there is tons of evidence for evolution, they just choose to deny it?      For instance, couldn't I claim there is no evidence for gravity? And if someone says 'Jump, you'll come back down", I'll just claim to ignore that evidence?      For instance::   Transitional fossils   ( a bit of a misnomer since all fossils are transitional, but oh well)   Kutchicetus (transitional fossil between whales and land mammals)    http://www.ufgi.ufl.edu/news/Ancient-wha...     http://www.learner.org/courses/biology/i...

20090226124542AAiCO2T	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do a lot of Christians give God credit to Paul's writing When most of Paul's writings didn't come from God?	10   As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:   11   There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.   12   They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.   13   Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:   14   Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:   15   Their feet are swift to shed blood:   16   Destruction and misery are in their ways:   17   And the way of peace have they not known:   18   There is no fear of God before their eyes.         All of this material that Paul wrote, all came from David, Not from God but yet you give God credit for it. WHY?       When the devil told Jesus in Matthew 4:5 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,   6   And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. That was also written by David. So will you give God credit for that as well?    The pastor at my old church, told someone that suicide could get him into heaven. So will you give God the credit for that as well?      Will you please stop giving God all the credit for what is written in the bible? Especially things that Paul states is not from God. Paul states that every thing he write is not from God, but you still give God the credit for everything Paul wrote. WHY?

All this is saying is that faith is the basis of hope. That doesn't amount to "knowledge" either. So why do the Christians keep saying they know?

I just want to some help in understanding something. I don't want prejudge people because its something I don't understand, and probably never. Say you work with (your boss) a homosexual (who is out of the closet). He brings his lovers around work sometime. He is an older white man (40's or 50's) and he dates college white boys. Is this the same type of homosexual as 2 older homosexual guys dating? You couldn't tell he's gay without the other guys being around. He seems masculine. He is a control freak at work. I'm asking because someone once told me to never trust a homosexual. As far as business goes. Never go into business with one, because they will always double cross you. I have seen this before, done to someone. I know all homosexuals aren't like that, so how can I tell who's good and who's bad. (In regards to the ones out the closet).      In other words, is there such a thing as a honorable homosexual. Not trying to be offensive, but honorable like a general or judge, who been in 1 relationship all their life, a person of their word, and person with solid unbreakable character.

20090226122002AAuX0eb	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Is the government responsible for bad upbringing of youngsters?	In some countries, parents aren't allowed to beat their kids or be strict with them, and they are not allowed to teach them what every parent should teach their children, because the child does not want to learn it.   Government pays for these children's education and their needs at times and these laws that protect the children have made the parents inferior to their children.   I've heard that a child took his parent to court simply because he didn't get the breakfast he wanted. (My teacher told me that).      Then there is the "Trash Culture in Britain" phenomenon, and some say that it's because of the parents who fail to teach their youngsters the basics.   ? ?      I've seen a girl scream in public because her mother didn't have the money to buy her an ice-cream, and she was just attacked by a lot of people who lectured her for being immature to the kid, followed by the police who lectured her.      This is really sad.   I know that this generalization is not fair because some kids do get proper upbringing, but it's a fact that a lot of kids are undisciplined and have no manners, and that leads to peer pressure.      It's good that the children are protected by law, but it shouldn't interfere with parents teaching some things to their kids, cause we all know that some kids do need beatings (not severe). I know if my mom didn't punish me for being an idiot, I wouldn't be having proper manners today.      So, isn't the government responsible for this, and should parents have the right to beat their kids (not severely) if necessary? I know I wouldn't tolerate it if my child calls me a f@ggot in public.      A survey in Britain showed that most adults are afraid of teenagers these days.   Very sad.

20090226125550AAzvuWV	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How to go about an interest in Islam?	I know that Muslims hold six articles of belief: there is only one God without limit, called Allah.Muhammad received the Qur'an as a copy of the eternal Qur'an which is inscribed in heaven. God created heavenly beings called angels to serve God and they are opposed by evil spirits.God sent his prophets to the earth at their appointed times, and the Prophet Muhammad was the last and greatest messenger of God. There will be a last day of world history called the Day of Judgement. Good and evil will be weighed in the balance. The wicked will be punished and the just will enjoy eternal life in Paradise. Everything in the universe has a predetermined course. Nothing happens without the will or knowledge of God.       I find quite a few similaritys between christianity and islam, and i find myself intriuged by islam. I have lead a christian life for the last year and a half but i still feel unsatisfied. I have a very strong interest in Islam, and I was just wondering how I should go about that. I live in the bible belt of oklahoma and i fear judgment and persecution if i except Islam but it just seems so right to me. What should i do? how should i go about it without offending people?

20090226134853AAdrEkO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians: why are there so many contradictions in Christianity?	1) Is Jesus (the son) the son of god (the Father)? I thought that the father, son and holy spirit made up the god? so why is the 'father' the god, and the 'son' through which salvation is achieved (but who is not god, but the son of god)? 1/3 rd part is NOT equal to god!         2) By saying god has 3 parts. isnt that putting limits to god? i thought the christian god was infinite? you should say there are not 3 parts, BUT INFINITE PARTS TO GOD. 3 IS A FINITE NUMBER.      The problem i see is, that by saying god has 3 parts; even though you are appearing monotheistic, you are claiming that your god is finite. That you can calculate the 'extent' of your god, and that is 3 parts.      If you say the three parts (father, son and spirit) are infinite, that is not true. Jesus was finite. Mary was impregnated, and he was born. He could be measured. On top of that, he died as well. These things make Jesus finite.      Also, wasn't Mary a human, and Jesus god in human/flesh form? Can a human give birth to a god? If a human can, what is so special about the god? I thought the god could not be measured? But if the human god can be measured, but god himself cannot; then Christianity is polytheistic.

20090226120555AACK0lQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think my  son can talk to spirits or is he imagining things?	My son is 4. He has always talked about my father who has been dead for 9 years now. Things like, grandpa said I can and stuff like that.His other grandpa is alive and he calls him papa. He is the only grandson that my father would of had. I can go on and on about stories.      I also found out that the house that i live in had an older couple who both passed away(natural causes) in my house.      He somehow knew that my Tv was a hand me down that my dad bought 12 years ago.      He always tells me things like him and his grandpa are going to go fishing. My exwife and me are lost. Most of the stories are pretty weird.      Three weeks ago I made my son  a grilled cheese. He sort of ate it and I was sitting down watching TV. He  was playing with his cars in the kitchen when he was done. He then got this little bouncing ball out of his room and started to play with it. He bounced it and it went on the counter. He then started by the sink and put his hand on the corner to scrape along it because he couldn’t see where it was. He was moving his arm along the top to feel if he could find it.              All of a sudden I heard the phone ring from the kitchen, I went up to answer it, and right when I did I seen that I left the back burner on, and it was bright red, and my son  was about to slide his hand over it.              However, the phone was still hung up on the wall in the hallway. I have no idea how I heard a phone ring from the kitchen but I did, and that is the reason I got up.      My son has done this for a few years now. My ex wife says that he talks about "John" his brother that is dead at her apartment.      Maybe the old man that died is old and he see's him as a grandpa?      Maybe I am just making something out of nothing....but you never know?

20090226114448AAAJnTU	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Lack of sex in relationship?	I'm asking again because I wasn't really satisfied with the other answers I got.      I've been dating this guy for about 3 months now. We were best friends for about 8 years. Now that we're together things are a little shaky. We never had the "honeymoon" period, which makes sense since we've known eachother for so long, but it seems like he never wants to have sex. The first time was incredibly awkward and anything that could go wrong did. Now the sex is great for the most part, but he never wants to have it.I have a very high sex drive and I know he did. I've had to endure 8 years of listening to who,where,when and how often with everyone else. He was quite promiscuous and even in past relationships always wanted sex. They would do it 2-3 times daily. I'm lucky if I get once a week. I've tried initiating it when I know he's most in the mood even though I hate morning sex. I've tried pawing at him throughout the day and night and he just moves away from me. At night he always has the excuse that he's tired. He is a hard worker so I started going to bed when he went even though I wasn't tired yet, or invite him to bed before he's ready to go to sleep. I lay there waiting for him to come to bed and he just plays on the computer for a while and then comes to bed when he's exhasted. I've talked to him about it and he acknowledges there's a problem and says he doesn't know why he doesn't want to. I mean, I'm not an unattractive girl (granted his last girlfriend was a model) but I can't help but feel that it's the way I look, caus I'm a stupid girl and that's always our first conclusion. He doesn't seem like he wants the relationship to end. He's very affetionate during the day with general touching/kissing/hugging. So what the hell is wrong?      Additional Details   Oh, and I don't believe he is cheating as he has never cheated on anyone and thinks people should just break up if they want to be with someone else.      And no, he's not lying about his past. I know most of the girls. His ex is a very close friend of mine. This city and it's surrounding ones have a serious case of the small world syndrome.         I know, I'm adding a lot of details, it's a very complex web we weave. lol The "changing it up thing" isn't an issue. Let's just say the last place we did it wasn't in our home. Maybe it is a "serious relationship vs not" issue? He did ask me to move in about 5 days after I ended my long term relationship with my previous live in boyfriend. He did tell me that he knew this wasn't going to be a friends with benefits sort of situation. I'm just still so confused. :(         And his previous relationships (he's only had 3 actual ones) never ended well, all because of them. Maybe he's worried about this one for some reason?

20090226140727AAXRO4a	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do we go to heaven the instant we die?	I know the bible clearly states that we "sleep" when we die. It also says later on in revelations, that the dead will be awakened on judgement day. So that leaves me to assume that we don't directly go to heaven or hell when we die for we have not yet been judged.    What confuses me, is then why would Jesus tell the man on the cross who was hung beside him, that that same day they would both be in heaven?    (Then he said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom." And Jesus said to him, "Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise." )   I'm confused....   Do we sleep and await judgement when we die or go directly to heaven or hell first?
20090226132006AAT9M5R	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Do people respond more to friendliness or aggression?	I've been friendly all my life but once in a while people walk all over me and take advantage of me.     I see that people who are aggressive and don't seem to care about people's feelings usually get ahead further in life and have people doing things for them constantly.     However, people usually respond to friendliness by being friendly back (most of the time), with a few people here and there taking advantage of them, and, well, aggressive people seem to spend their time fighting with the world.     Which is better in your opinion?

20090226140030AAW0grc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do so many Christians believe revelation is dead?	I was studying in my Catholic bible class and I came to Revelations 22 18-19 and that is where the issues began to arise and I would love some body to explain my questions.      1. verse 18 many Christians state that this verse means all other revelation is dead and can not come forth  but yet many books of the New Testament came after Revelations or at the same time.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_the_...  and many other websites and scholars will argue about the time line.       2. still in verse 18 wasn't the bible put together by men 200+ years after the last scripture was written not by the prophets that actually wrote the documents there is proof that they started with Genesis and ended with Revelations for a reason because they talked about the beginning of time and the end of time.      3. Still on 18 when John wrote this verse wouldn't he be writing about his "book" since the bible (which in Latin means collection of books) wasn't around for another 200+ years.      4. verse 19 John specifically states "And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of THIS PROPHECY" (added emphasis) isn't he just stating his book was trademarked      5. Finally verse 19, if he is talking about the whole bible why does he mention this prophesy. since everybody and their dogs know that more then half of the bible has no prophecy at all wouldn't he be lying about the bible .       Please help me understand this verse of scripture I think in this dark time of fear and doubt it would be good to look to Gods appointed leader to help us understand his way and how to get out.

Why, then, does God punish those who find it difficult to believe in something that presents no evidence of existing. Isn't it accepted and okay that someone shouldn't believe in something they can't see? Can't God understand this?

20090226153926AA3ZjR7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, did you know that slavery is bible approved?	Except for murder, slavery has got to be one of the most immoral things a person can do.  Yet slavery is rampant throughout the Bible in both the Old and New Testaments.  The Bible clearly approves of slavery in many passages, and it goes so far as to tell how to obtain slaves, how hard you can beat them, and when you can have sex with the female slaves.                 Many Jews and Christians will try to ignore the moral problems of slavery by saying that these slaves were actually servants or indentured servants.  Many translations of the Bible use the word "servant", "bondservant", or "manservant" instead of "slave" to make the Bible seem less immoral than it really is.  While many slaves may have worked as household servants, that doesn't mean that they were not slaves who were bought, sold, and treated worse than livestock.                 The following passage shows that slaves are clearly property to be bought and sold like livestock.                 However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you.  You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land.  You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance.  You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way.  (Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)                 The following passage describes how the Hebrew slaves are to be treated.                 If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years.  Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom.  If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year.  But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him.  If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master.  But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children.  I would rather not go free.'  If he does this, his master must present him before God.  Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl.  After that, the slave will belong to his master forever.  (Exodus 21:2-6 NLT)                 Notice how they can get a male Hebrew slave to become a permanent slave by keeping his wife and children hostage until he says he wants to become a permanent slave.  What kind of family values are these?                 The following passage describes the sickening practice of sex slavery.  How can anyone think it is moral to sell your own daughter as a sex slave?                 When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are.  If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again.  But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.  And if the slave girl's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter.  If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife.  If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment.  (Exodus 21:7-11 NLT)                 So these are the Bible family values!  A man can buy as many sex slaves as he wants as long as he feeds them, clothes them, and screws them!                 What does the Bible say about beating slaves?  It says you can beat both male and female slaves with a rod so hard that as long as they don't die right away you are cleared of any wrong doing.                 When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished.  If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property.  (Exodus 21:20-21 NAB)                 You would think that Jesus and the New Testament would have a different view of slavery, but slavery is still approved of in the New Testament, as the following passages show.                 Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear.  Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.  (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)                 Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of God and his teaching will not be shamed.  If your master is a Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful.  You should work all the harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts.  Teach these truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them.  (1 Timothy 6:1-2 NLT)                 In the following parable, Jesus clearly approves of beating slaves even if they didn't know they were doing anything wrong.                 The servant will be severely punished, for

My grandfather told me years ago, "there should be no african american or asian american or mexican american, there should only be an american". I believe race has zero importance to society. Its been scientifically proven that no race is better or worse than another, so why haven't we as a society just drop-ed the race issue all together.       I don't care what skin color someone is. I never say, i have a black friend, i say i have a friend. Its irrelevent that his skin is darker than mine.

The Egyptian Ankh was worn and used well up to the medieval period by Christians to symbolise their faith, and seems a far better symbol than the cross of crusifixion. In fact this was first discouraged as it was similar to wearing an axe or a hangmans noose as a symbol. The Ichthys (fish) was slightly better, and was adopted outside of the Ankh's influence - so why settle for the execution cross ?

The UK imports hundred of thousands of non europeans into Europe every month. These people have nothing to do with Europe.  All these people from  Pakistan, India, Nigeria, Barbados find a backdoor and a passport to Europe simply because they are part of the Common wealth, *which is an UK matter and has nothing to do with the EU* yet we see the brits getting all heated up with a few italians and a few portuguese workers? Will the brits get real? Europeans have a right to work in Europe!  My town has 20.000 people, more than 10% of which are Brits! Half of which Pakistani and Indian brits!

Leviticus 11      Jesus Christ destroyed 2000 pigs to heal one man       13And forthwith Jesus gave them leave(permission). And the unclean spirits(the devils) went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.

20090226154302AAJFEAo	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can people believe in Christianity,?	With all of its stupid contradictions. The religion seriously makes no sense. Think about it; If god can control everything why would he put atheists on the Earth to detest him? Why would he want people on Earth going through huge conflicts over his existence. If he wants the whole world fighting, would that not make him Satan? So is God Satan? Why would God give people the idea to sin if they will be punished for it? He wants people to suffer? That would make him Satan as well. But at the same time they say Satan gives people the ideas to suffer. God and Satan as separate beings. But if this is true why would God send anybody to hell, if he is all knowing, he must know about Satan. If Satan gives people Irresistable urges to sin, than God should be able to know that and forgive the "sinner". If God sends people to Hell for sinning, knowing full well that they were given an irresistable urge to, then he would want that person to suffer, once again making him Satan or Satan-like. Which would mean he was the person who wanted them to sin in the first place. Really, this is all bullshit.

20090226150134AAjx42y	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?      Sociobiology teaches that a certain set of egotistical, selfish values remain with us from antiquity and will continue to be cavemen. Certainly the insanity of this Second Great Depression seems to confirm the selfish war of all against war that hides behind the facade of law, civilization and morality.       How can the infinite pains of life be justified in comparison to the calm serenity of nonexistence? Has any man in history lived a life so blessed as to outweigh the pleasures of endless dreamless sleep? Is not man's greatest sin to have been born? What duty is there to continue to live? We did not choose to be born.      Why pass on genes, and sentence another generation to hell for the selfish pleasure of sexual desire?      Schopenhauer said we were in the worst of all possible worlds. If any worst it could not exist as mass suicide would follow. Instead an irrational will to live which we could not control forces us to go on with our wretched lives until we commit the sin of parenthood and sentence another generation to the hell of existance. Sex is the tool the WIll uses to ensure the survival of this hell.      So if there is no rational reason for living, and if one rejects the values of sociobiology and the times, then what is the philsophical argument against suicide?

This person needs to go through the rest of her life with a curse on her or a hex or anything that will FOREVER make her miserable.      We have tried being the bigger people and not saying and doing anything to her but it is not working and even when we avoid her she still continues.   She has driven some of my friends to suicide attempts multiple times and still mocks them over it.   There is no other way of stopping her or ignoring it. She is doin things to people she does not even know. This girl will always act like this even in the future and others need to be kept safe from what she can do.      Please help me.

We know and appreciate the tremendous amount of intelligent design and planning that went into landing a man on the moon.

How reasonable is it to believe that purely natural processes, with no designer, no intelligence, and no plan, produced a human being.

20090226162530AA1Q63h	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Literal Genesis Folks, will this help solve your difficulties with dinosaurs?	You guys claim dinosaurs and people lived together ...in fact you claim all animals and plants that have ever existed were created at the same time. Problem for you is there's a lot of scientific evidence against this view. Intelligent design addresses some of your issues but not all of them. You need another theory to help explain your position. Why don't you try reviving the idea of spontaneous generation? After all this idea says living things arise from non-living matter. Imagine! You could claim that God created dinosaurs first and then when they died, lions, tigers, giraffes - whatever you like - spontaneously developed from the putrefying dinosaur flesh!! You'd also be able to claim the venerable figure of Aristotle as an adherent to this theory.      You could muddy the waters even more by getting school boards to support teaching this in school.  After all, we should be free to discuss all competing theories. And, it does have a longer and more distinguished pedigree than ID.

20090226170245AAHEu4p	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is atheism anti-intellectual?	Lets look at probability.      What is the probability that if one were to shred an entire dictionary into 100 billion pieces, put it in a bag shake it up and pour it onto the ground so that they form a perfect dictionary as before?      Or how likely is it that a wonderfully designed car with intricate parts, each with a purpose, had no maker? If i said to you, Behold my Mercedes, its cool right? Yup, and I believe that no one made it, because that parts simply came together from all the minerals in the Earth over billions of years and here it is.. you'd say I'm stupid.      Look at your eye (lol) it is wonderful, each part down to the cell has a specific purpose.. likewise all the parts of the human body.. Logically speaking can you really say that all of the sophistication of the human body, of all of nature and life, was mere coincidence?      Charles Darwin himself said that to assert that the human eye came about by natural selection would be absurd.      The Earth, and the fullness thereof was designed intelligently and to think otherwise beyond me.

20090226163541AAJIyO5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is Christianity anti-intellectual?	"Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding." ~ Proverbs 3:5      "Believers are not to be led by logic. We are not even to be led by good sense." ~ Kenneth Copeland, The Force of Faith      "Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has: it never comes to the aid of spiritual things, but--more frequently than not--struggles against the divine Word, treating with contempt all that emanates from God." ~ Martin Luther      In what ways is Christianity anti-intellectual?  In what ways is it not?  And, if it is anti-intellectual, is that necessarily a bad thing?      I don't ask attack questions.  I'm only asking people to analyze one element of Christianity.

20090226102030AA25Wtu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Where does the Catholic Church get the authority for these "doctrines"?	1) Commanding for Celibate priests   2) Forbidding the eating of meat during lent   (oh, there are others...but I'm just speaking on these for now)       1 Timothy 4:1-5   Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;   Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;      Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats,       which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.   For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:   For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.      Notice the "forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meat" and the "nothing is to be refused."      I am not trying to attack anyone. I'm just curious as to why the Catholic Church holds these "doctrines" when they are clearly commanded against in the Bible.

20090226100246AAQS23w	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did John mean dont add to the book of revelations or the bible?	One thing that always comes out of someones mouth about the book of mormon is that god said dont add to the word in revelations which wasnt god but was the apostle john who was inspired by god. First off the bible wasnt put together by constantine and his bishops in chronological order meaning first to last in date which they were written. It does somewhat but after a while its all mixed around. Revelations was NOT the latest book written in the bible. I repeat Revelations was NOT the latest book written in the bible. If you disagree then you merely haven't done enough studying. So everything after the book of revelations must be false? John when he said dont add to this book meant dont add to the book of revelations not to the bible which didnt even exist while he was writing this. I hope this helps clear up this statement. Also wondering if scriptural evidence can prove the men who put the bible together (constantine and his bishops) were actually inspired by God or does it come to just an assumption?

20090226112039AAJlRp2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do people expect too much and should life be this easy?	If you ever connect with someone in life, when does it get to the point where people start expecting you to help them?      Let's say everyone gave me everything I wanted, would that mean everyone else had something to lose? Hmm... That can't be right? Can it?      Maybe it's a flawed philosophy. Maybe both parties are expected to do something. Maybe it isn't flawed and people get naturally distracted. Is getting distracted what one would find being easy?      I don't think blaming getting distracted is a good excuse for my own failures sometimes. The knowledge is available to excel. This seems to be possible because I couldn't have even decided without having an idea of what I wanted to experience. Those needs find ways to take a life of their own and keeping them from taking over at decision making time is quite the task to master.      It's like making a breakfast burrito at home. Does it taste better? Did I make money or save money by making it myself? Do things taste better because someone else made it? Is it the convenience that is cherished? Is the convenience necessary to some but abused by others? Lot's of questions just for something that simple.      Should I expect you to make me a breakfast burrito because I know how to make it myself? Eggs, sausage and cheese please. Mine taste better anyway....

Matthew 15:2-9 (New International Version)    2"Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands before they eat!"     3Jesus replied, "And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition? 4For God said, 'Honor your father and mother and 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death. 5But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is a gift devoted to God,' 6he is not to 'honor his father with it.

My Dad was born a JW and my mom converted from a Pentecostal Church when they started dating. They got married and had me. When I was 2 my mom decided not to go any more because she realized that they did not have the truth. My dad and her decided to stay married. When I was 4, my mom was in a car accident and needed blood. She concented and had 4 blood transufions. Sh asked the doctors not to tell my dad until the procedure was done, that way he counld't interfere.    When he found out, he told the elders and the elders advised him to get a divorce. He did. My mom moved back to her hometown and my dad and me stayed in the town. My mom wanted to take me with her but the elders and my dad wanted me to stay because if I went with my mom I would be going to a Pentecostal Church and that was considered false religion. So my dad got his way and I stayed with him.    2 years later he remarried a girl named Sadie. She was a full time pioneer. She didn't have a job, all she did was witness. She and my dad had three childern, all girls. Fast Forward to now. About a year ago I deciced that Jehovah's Witnesses were wrong and what the watchtower teaches was wrong. On my twice a week phone calls with my mom (my dad let me talk to her on Tuesdays and Thursdays) I told my mom that I wanted to come live with her. She said that was fine but I would have to get it threw the courts. Well I cound't. So I decided to run to my moms house. I had a best friend that was going on a vaction to were my mom lived and I got a ride. I was there 3 days and my dad come to get me and dragged me back. So I caused a lot of trouble for my dad. And when we went back to the judge he asked what I wanted.I told him my story and said I wanted to live with my mom. And my dad said whatever fine cause he didn't want any more trouble with me.          SO HERE"S THE PROBLEM:   I can't move until school's over. That's 4 months from now.

I'm not aloud to ask for rides or anything else, nor money. If I want it I have to find a way myself. A girl at the church I've been going to also goes to my school. Her mom said that if I wanted, I could stay with them, rent free until I move down with my mom. At this piont I don't think my dad cares. The only reason why he would say know is cause once a week he has three girls my age come from the Kingdom Hall and share the bible with me. Not interested. So, should I take the offer or put up with it for a little while longer?

20090226171319AAotLmh	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What are the Christian excuses/justifications for the many times the Bible God orders the death of infants?	17Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him. (Num. 31:17)      34And we captured all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed every city, men, women, and children; we left none remaining; (Deut. 2:34)      3Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have; do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ***.'" (1 Sam. 15:3)      16Their infants will be dashed in pieces before their eyes; their houses will be plundered and their wives ravished. (Isaiah 13:16)      9Happy shall he be who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rock! (Psalm 137:9)      18Their bows will slaughter the young men; they will have no mercy on the fruit of the womb; their eyes will not pity children. (Isaiah 13:18)      6slay old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but touch no one upon whom is the mark. And begin at my sanctuary." So they began with the elders who were before the house. (Ezek. 9:6)      14Give them, O LORD- what wilt thou give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. (Hosea 9:14)      16Samaria shall bear her guilt, because she has rebelled against her God; they shall fall by the sword, their little ones shall be dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women ripped open. (Hosea 13:16)      29At midnight the LORD smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the first-born of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the first-born of the cattle. (Ex. 12:29)      Some of these quotes are followers repeating what god supposedly told them...some, like the last supposedly comes directly from god.      I am interested in how people who are so unforgiving when it comes to humans killing babies/fetuses can in the same breath come up with every conceivable justification/excuse for baby killing when their god is the baby killer?       So give it your best shot...justify the murder of babies ordered or caused by your god. Make the excuses for why Man Killing Babies = BAD and God killing babies = GOOD? I love to see hypocrisy in action so feel free to try to convince me that a baby killing god is worthy of my respect and worship.      If you are going to take the easy way out of answering a tough question with "God works in mysterious ways" or "God is God and his actions should never be questioned and his motives never doubted ." then please don't bother answering.

20090226100535AAMcz0t	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The name in the bible REVEALED?	Since the bible is written 600 years or so before Mohammed - is this a Prophecy?      Click the link, and on the top of the page - in the yellow box it will say 'listen to this chapter in hebrew'. The ORIGINAL language of the bible is Hebrew.      Listen to it in hebrew - go to timing 2.25 - once there pause it so you have control over the timing. Once the person stops speaking - youll have control over the time. Then click play again and between timing 2.29-2.31 you will here 'Mohamedin'.      Now 'in' at the end is a sign of respect as God is called Elo but the hebrew language refers to him as 'Eloin'      So again i ask - why is Mohammed mentioned in the bible? with 'in' at the end it clearly shows respect to Mohammed       http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3005....

We are told abortion is a woman's choice forget what GOD says about *Life*      We are told everyone should have a *Peice of the American Dream* forget about working hard as GOD says do not be idle, work for you want...   We are told Children have rights even if that means dis-obedience to responsible parents  forget what GOD Says about discipline and obedience children should have for parents..      We are told Kids are going to have sex anyways so give them Condoms teach them about sex, forget what GOD says about abstience until marraige and that sex and marriage is the Key to Safe sex  true love and happiness...      So since the WORLD says forget what GOD said  *Were running the show*   What did we get?

20090226162636AAqlCef	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Is the rising number of acronyms the result of the English language becoming more PC?	Think about it. English is becoming more politically correct (PC).  Therefore to be more PC, we add more words (George Carlin said it best when 'shell shock' has now evolved into Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (aka PTSD).  This causes more time to be spent communicating, so people tend to shorten things via acronyms.  Another example is IMHO and IDK (for a while I thought the latter was some weird smiley).     What causes this change? Do other languages have this? Could this be a factor in the rise of communication issues amongst society?    I'm trying to be unbiased as a I can here.

My questions are   1) is it possible to take german for an alevel and then be able to learn spanish on the side ?   i mean be able to be fluent in 2 langages?   (or am i justwasting my time)      and 2) i didnt want to take a qualification in spanish (eg take a gcse in it outside of school ) as i feel i should focus on my a levels but however if i do get my spanish to a good standard i was hoping future employers wouldent ask for qualifications in it as i am half spanish so i was hoping they would naturally assume that i would speak it anyway      , but i would have my german qualification to show them as nobody in my family is german      am i right to assume this? or would they want me to have a qualification in it?      with thanks x

I have had several arguments with my friend over this. I personally think shes obsessed with this priest. She says she loves his mass and that hes cool and funny etc... She only likes going to mass if hes giving it. Recently she had to go out of state for two weeks for training and said that she was sad because she wasnt going to go to mass because the priest she likes isnt there. She even knows the car he drives!! Yesterday was the topper. We went to anothe church because the one she likes was full and she didnt pay attention, she started text messaging, granted we were outside of church because it was full but stil...im sure she wouldnt do that in mass with the other priest. I keep telling her that the way she thinks of him is not healthy and that if he knew even he would tell her that. Oh and when i tell  her that she has to stop that behavior because he will eventually leave she goes all crazy and just tells me to shut up because she doesnt want to think about it..!!??   What can i tell her to snap out of it? Or how do i explain that what shes doing or how shes obsessing is not right..at least thats my opinion. Any help?   oh by the way im catholic..

20090226160630AAoaniO	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why is the world full of sexism?	Women want to have feminist rights and laws but most of these laws in one way or another belittle a man's right.      I truly believe that if a woman gets pregnant and wants an abortion then the father should have the right to stop it because the child inside her is 50% his. Yes as humans are designed men can't carry babies but why should a woman abort a baby that is lobed and wanted by the father. And with adoptions they need to change the law to find the father before the child can be adopted  out. Women shouldn't lie and say I have no idea who the father is. Women have some respect and stop sleeping around.      With child support shouldn't whom ever has the custody of the child receive support for the child at the time custody is granted?      I think that people need to realize children don't cost as much as people claim. Look clothes can look brand new and be bought fro resale shops at a fraction of the cost or buy brand new at the end of the season sale the next size up. It is called budgeting and planning. Just like school supplies. They have great sales before school starts. After school activities are optional children are not required to do them. The child might want to but if you can't afford it do what my friends did when we were in school. Fund raisers and bake sales.      And people if you are buying a house you pay a set rate so the other person shouldn't be contributing to your asset. Yes your children might used electric and water. Cable is optional it is not required by law to have and neither is the internet. Yes you need car insurance but then again why should somebody else have to buy for it or for your car note. Look not everybody is entitled to a car. Take a bus if your budget does not allow for this luxury.      People shouldn't have kids if they have no idea what a need is and what a want is. Supporting a child requires time, love, energy, food, a roof over their heads, electricity, and water. These are course are the basics. Luxuries come at a price and if you can't afford them then work harder and earn it.      Why is it that nobody wants to work for a living anymore?

20090226111538AAGR56U	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Ok, were some of  Muhammed's grandchildren Jewish?	Ok, I asked this question before and no one wanted to answer so I'm going to try religion.  First off, I'm Jewish and my husband is Christian but according to my religion my children (the one born and the one soon to be born lol)  are Jewish because the trait of Jewishness is carried in the mother's line.  Also, my husband says its ok to raise his children in the Jewish religion so they will be attending Orthodox Day Schools when they reach school age.  As a side note any of you Muslim and children of Jewish fathers who see a driving need to convert after this question can easily do so by going to a Mikvah (ritual bath)   Ok, Muhammed had two Jewish wives so there children would be Jewish and if they were daughter, his grandsons would be Jewish.  That means that a lot of the prophets after Muhammed are Jewish.  Also, I read where the scribe that wrote the Koran down for Muhammed was Jewish.  This means today that all Muslims must look to the Chief Orthodox Rabbi of Jerusulum for any religious interpretations of the Koran because its primarily a Jewish Book, and Immans must be licensed in Israel.  So what do all of you think of this analysis.

20090226165251AAhQ6IB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	War Between Religion and Science?	I am going to tell you right now that this is a long question, but please for your fellow man, venture to read what I have to say.       I have just recently started reading a book by Dan Brown called Angels and Demons. I have always been a man of science and I always will be, but this book made me question that. Is the book true? Do science and religion work together, science only trying to aid in proof of god? The only thing that makes me question is the death of the Illuminati and the purpose of there death. It has always been implied to me that you must choose between the two, you may never have both. Since reading this book I am led to question that statement. I am seriously considering being baptized into Christianity, but there is one serious problem. There are two major issue that has made science and religion enemy's, two major differences, two questions. Where did we come from, and what happens after death. I think that science is winning in where we came from (evolution) with all of the proof it offers, but I also think that religion is winning with what happens after death. Are they like matter and anti-matter, you cant have one without the other, or is one predominant? So what do I do about this? Who are you, man of God, or man of science? And what is your input or opinion?

20090226164149AAOb7UV	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Should I be lusting for younger girls?	I know most of my friends would be calling me sick and a paedo if they knew.   Basically I have been 16 for about 4 months. I am in 10th grade and I have a cousin in 8th grade. I was visiting her house recently and she had some friends over. So I'm sitting in the garden smoking a joint and her friends come outside and I am talking to them. Whilst I speak I make eye contact with each one when I notice one of them more that the others. She is ******* beautiful. Seriously gonna break alot of hearts during her life. I couldn't believe what I was thinking, because I have never looked at a girl of that age in such a way. It wasn't even just her looks, she had a personality and **** that I found so attractive. I must admit she wasn't as mature as I would like but if I didn't think I would get teased, then I would consider a relationship with her. I saw her in school the next day when I was no longer high, and I felt the same way.   Do you think these are appropriate feeling to have for a girl this much younger than me. Please don't view the 2 year age difference think about it in depth, like mental maturity etc. because I kinda feel like this is slightly pedoish.

Alright, now I know this isn’t real it’s just something that flickers across my mind on a daily basis: When observing those around me, my attention is called to how very fragile they can be. There are so many ways a person could be killed. And in each hour, I see at least one human do something that may cost them their life. This got me thinking:   What if in every few minutes, we died some terribly brutal way, only to emerge at the end with no memories of it?          Yes, this is a trick question. The first person to answer correctly will be selected as best.
20090226160218AAnCgZa	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, explain yourselves!!?	Is it OK to have slaves??   Exodus 21:7   "When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do."   Exodus 21:20-21   "When a man strikes his slave, male or female, with a rod and the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished. But if the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished; for the slave is his money.      Have you killed your son when he had been rebellious?   Deuteronomy 21:18-21   "If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him,  his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town. They shall say to the elders, "This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a profligate and a drunkard." Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid."      And if God really was loving why would he say these things?   1 Samuel 15:3   "Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys."   Exodus 32:27   "Then he said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor."      god certainly doesn't seem very respectful to women in particular   1 Corinthians 11:3-10   "Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it is just as though her head were shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head.  man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head."      im excited to see what you have to argue against your own bible...

20090226104612AAmhP12	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What are the European Pentecostals doing to save Mrs. Jade Goody Tweed's life? Is THIS how The World Ends?	When Satan came for John Paul II,    I did nothing, because I was not a Roman Catholic.   When The Devil came for Harold Pinter,   I did nothing because I was not into plays.   When The Old Serpent swallowed Eartha Kitt,   I did nothing because Halle Berry is on DVD now.   When The Evil One came for me,   I knew those [*Bleep!*]ards in R & S probably sent him!   BEAM ME UP, TRIP!      This is the excellent opportunity for the Christian community to either PROVE its worth by healing the unfortunately named Jade Goody Tweed. It is the PRINCIPLE of the thing that matters, not who she was.. uh, is. In Nigeria, we had a governor who was asked why there were so few mineral resources in his state, and he retorted that there were PLENTY of mineral resources in Kano state! There was the COKE factory, the FANTA factory, they had SPRITE...! (sic!)      I just don't think someone should be sentenced to DEATH just because they don't know where Cambridge University is!       This could be the point in history where Unbelievers wake up and take Pitchforks and Torches to all the churches claiming to have Healing Powers. The Roman Catholic Church used to claim that their pope could heal like Jesus- had a ritual at somewhere called Lourdes- and have ALWAYS maintained that THEIR prayers are SUPERIOR to those of every other denomination put together. Then John Paul II had Parkinson's Disease, and ALL the priests, monks, and nuns who never have any YAHOO! couldn't heal him. Nor were any of the saints he made up (more than all other popes put together) any good.      The EVANGELICAL Church claims that ITS prayers are SUPERIOR to all those FANATICS, who SPEAK WITH TONGUES, then BILLY GRAHAM had Parkinson's Disease.       ONLY Pentecostal Christians have a consistent track record of believing in and handling Healing Powers. But a high-profile case like this one can be like the Hurricane Katrina of UK Christianity, proving that there IS no connection with GOD over THERE.

Here is my story    I have 9 sisters 4 older 4 younger and my twin sister and one more sister on the way. I have to share a room with my twin sister and my 6-year-old sister. I don't care we have a big room. My twin and I are not 13 yet.   We all go to a private Christian school. We all eat lunch together. I allow them to give me makeovers we get board. They done this for 5-6 years. We live out in the country. 45 MINS from our school. They are nice about putting makeup on me. They make me look good. I wear there clothes. It is not embarrassing to share a room with my sisters. I am going to live at home during college. So are my sisters. We change in front of each other. We are related. They have lots of choices do put on me my    Twin sister has lots of clothes that fit me. They are tying to get    Our parents to buy me my own makeup and girl clothes. I say no because i don't want to be a girl for life.( i think)    My name is a girl name and i am a boy the hospital messed up. So I go by a nick name at school. I like dancing and some other girly stuff. I do have some female features. My voice is soft like a girls. My hair is down to my shoulders. I look like my twin sister. I look like a girl. But i am a boy. I got a full body scan yesterday. I been have some pain. It feels like a girl having her period.    They did some other test today and They found out that I have a    working female reproduction system.    They believe that there me and my sister were going to be triplets but one did not grow and apart of the thing got on me to make me partly a boy. It is hard to explain    When i do get the surgery I have to be  a wake. They wont be able to put me to sleep the stuff they use. will make me ill. So they said when i do deiced they will allow my twin to be in    the room with me during it. So she can keep my mind of off the pain.      I already have a girl name. The hospital messed up my name.   My name is amy. But I go by one of my middle names. I have two middle names. I go by one of them which is Jeremiah I have a long name. My last name for example XXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX      So if want to have biolgical kids in the long future. I will have to    be a girl. I have a working female reproduction system. I have female hormones.    After my doctors appointment. My mom and my twin sister and I went and ate at wendy's and talked.    Then after we ate. I went and got my ear's priced. Then my mom and twin sister helped me get girl clothes and makeup. Shoes, makeup. A purse.   Some days i fell like i should be a girl. I already have the girl name so i want have to change it.       I am scared of surgery. But i want to have biolgical kids. If I want    to have kids i need surgery and i know it wont take long. I know i    will have to stay in the hospital no more then a week.

20090226165214AAiuN2y	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are you against America growing industrial hemp? If so, will you hear me out and tell you feel the same?	Hemp can be made into almost anything.  Fuel, clothing, wood, and food to name a few.  The wood and cloth made from hemp is many times strong and more durable than tree made products. "i have a hemp sweater thats 10 years old and It looks like it could go another 20" Also, hemp can grow to a 10ft tree size in 6-12 months.  Compare that to a tree! And hemp can grow in any soil and environment, just like a weed. We could fill all our unused land in America with it and create hundreds of thousands of jobs.  All the new products would be great for export.  We will finally start to get some of those billions of dollars we send to China by shopping a Walmart, Targets, Home Depot, and almost every clothing store you shop at.  Yes, growing hemp would open doors towards using/illegally growing/legalizing marijuana.  But even if it became legal think of the much needed tax money we would collect.  We all know now its much healthier/safer than alcohol.  Either way, isn't it worth getting Americas economy back and increase the standard of living.

20090226132420AAakS95	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why is it so unreasonable to atheists that a God may very well exist?	Firstly, I'm not assigning any specific or personal attributes to him here, only as the creator of our universe. It is obvious that the Big bang (if true) could not have happened without cause because it, itself, is comprised of space and time, therefore it could not create itself      Secondly, it is most likely the Big bang must have been started from something outside of the singularity in a dimension which was timeless and therefore required no cause. It is clear that a cause cannot lie within the singularity since that cause would merely require another cause, requiring even further explication, ad infinitum      And thirdly, any transdimensional action taken from the time dimension working with the singularity requires a cause because the "being" or whatever it may be, was working directly with spacetime material, therefore He had to apply direct action (cause) upon the singularity to put the expansion into motion, but....since the being itself exists in a timeless dimension, it, itself needs no explanation since it is eternal and therefore is a self standing truth which needs not to be explained, rendering all questions such as "who created God then" irrelevant and unnecessary

20090226115406AA7pIl6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do we do about people who think Pentecostals are heretics?	So I was raised in a Spirit-filled church.  I'm Foursquare and I'm from Los Angeles where Foursquare was founded and where we have lots of churches.  I never realized there were people who thought we were heretics (this is directed against our friends in Assemblies of God, Church of God in Christ and the Rhema churches as well).      I get that some people disagree with some of what we believe because of course all the denominations are going to be a little different or else we'd all be the same one.  But there seem to be people that really hate us, sort of like what the Mormons experience, except that I thought Foursquare was a part of mainstream Christianity.  I guess you could say who cares what they think, but I find it frustrating.  Is this widespread -- this belief that we're heretics?

I don't want to be offensive and get him all mad, I just want him to stop being gay.  I want nieces and nephews if possible and I believe his lifestyle is against the Law of God.
20090226131826AAnygPM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do Christians mean when they say that Jesus was the 'son' of god?	Does it mean, the actual son?       Answer this simply: is jesus the son of god? Yes, no will suffice.      Please, dont give me stuff about godheads.          Jesus in this world was human, he was born to Mary (i am willing to accept she was a virgin, and she gave birth to him. Miracle), and he died on the cross.      Is there any proof besides Jesus's or his disciples' "words" that he is alive? Or is it possible that he died because a human does, and is dead?       If Jesus is the son of god (who was human on this earth; but doesnt have any form in the Heavens), and god is god. Aren't they 2 separate personalities? Why is salvation achieved only through Jesus, if there is the father (the actual god out there) and the holy spirit (for which, there is no proof at all)?

20090226132606AAbY9dJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What are some holiday traditions that we, as Christians, should avoid?	In the interest of saving lives the Citizens Auxiliary Police spent this February 14th at John Muir Elementary (my children's school) teaching them about safe sex, abstinence and promoting modest dress.  Upon our arrival to our first class (a group of 3rd graders) we were astounded to see the children sharing Valentine's Day Cards with each other.      It is well known, among Bible believing Christians, that Valentine’s cards are a gateway to underage sex and pregnancy so I was astounded to see such activity going on at my own community school.  After chastising the 3rd grade teacher, members of the Citizens Auxiliary Police were sent to each classroom to ensure that any valentine related activity was suspended and any valentine related decorations were removed.  Most of the teachers agreed with our stance and took away the children's cards accordingly but there were a few hold outs.      A wily 1st grade teacher refused to allow Sub-Commander Jim Perry to enter her classroom for the purpose of removing valentines and valentine related paraphernalia.  Fearing that her resistance may encourage a revolt among the other teachers Sub-Commander Perry and trainee John Dallas were forced to take things to the next level.  Thankfully a simple 3-point take down was sufficient to subdue Mrs. Valdez although there was some regret that the restraint was not able to be applied in an area away from the students.  Once the valentines and related paraphernalia were removed, Mrs. Valdez was released from custody and set free to return to her chalk board.      Thankfully the children at John Muir Elementary were set free from whorish activities this Valentine’s Day but I know future holidays may pose a similar threat.  What else should we as Christians be avoiding?      God Bless!      Jay Santos   Brigadier General   Citizens Auxiliary Police
20090226125740AAN40hB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What would motivate a Native American to become Muslim?	I ran into a Native American girl who became Muslim. I know she has an aggressive attitude towards any type of Christian. She even called me a KKK, but I'm a Hispanic Catholic and definitely not racist. Do you think she chose that religion just to spite Christians? Did she choose Islam in a hypocritical way? She seems to be very cocky and proud about being Muslim. I don't go around saying HEY I'M CATHOLIC. What makes her religion better and what is her motive for choosing Islam? She even told me that this isn't my country but hispanic have been here since the 1500's. I guess she's still hung up about the Europeans taking over. This cant be healthy.

20090226124057AAqqGAt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can you answer me this about heaven?	If no one is sad in heaven, then what about the person who's family went to hell, aren't they always going to be sad knowing that their family is burning for all eternity?      What happens then, does God cast them out of heaven, or does a "kind and loving" God just wipe your mind clean so you no longer have good memories?      But if he wipes your mind, you start to ask where you came from, and he couldn't lie, so the cycle would start all over again.      So what happens to sad people in heaven?

What if it turns out that people who blindly follow man-made religions and profess to know and understand the nature of God go someplace very, very bad when they die...      ... while people who acknowledge and accept that mankind does not and cannot ever know the nature of God go someplace good?      The fact is, this possibility is just as likely as the reverse, which you all have used to increase your membership over the years.       Might it be a good idea for you all to hedge your bets?

20090226124518AANoVta	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is up with God? Why does He care so much about what's going on here and what we're doing?	I am a total CHRISTIAN believer, sold-out, full of faith, but it blows my mind that God is SO invested in EARTH and what we're doing here (especially individuals). God is all about US. HE IS ALL ABOUT US - our faithfulness, our faith, our belief, our actions. What is God up to? What is this drama? What is this progression? Why didn't God just create the Universe and planet He wanted and leave it at that? (Perfect...continuous belief in him...sinless..following Him). What is His plan? What is the POINT? What is YOUR insight on this question? Yes, I've read the Bible. But why the loooonnnnnggggg story of EARTH and His creation and His creation's goings and comings and relationships (and lack of relationship) with him. I am asking for your subject opinion/take here. WHAT IS GOING ON!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? THanks.
