20090226193755AAvPoZV	Sports;Tennis	Do you like/dislike players based on their looks?	It seems like the majority of the "hot" players, have the biggest fanbases. I'm not saying that they're bad players, but do you think looks plays a role in who you decide to cheer for?   I think for me, if I see a hottie, I'll be like Oooh, whos that? But then if I realise later that they are an arrogant pig or lame tennis player than I will probably dislike them regardless of how attractive they are. So I think initially, good looks plays a small part, but at the end of the day I judge the tennis players on their tennis.   So do you think it plays a part at all in who you choose as a favourite or is it just stictly how they play tennis?

20090226200131AAzAL41	Sports;Basketball	Cavs should have traded and its not because they lost to the Rockets?	Yeah, the Cavaliers can dominate versus all of the garbage in the NBA, BUT they have had a pretty dam favorable schedule throughout the whole season and have coasted. They hardly had any back to backs, and never really had a stretch of games that were against tough opponents, until this week. Danny Ferry didn't make a trade because he though he would screw up the chemistry but the truth is he might of just cost Lebron his title. Why would you want a inconsistent player who can shoot lights out on one night and not make any contributions most of the other nights. I'm talking to you Wally. He was the perfect trading chip because of his expiring contract, they should have traded for a consistent former all star in Vince Carter. Or maybe even Salmons, or somebody that actually contributes every night. The Cavs played like crap tonight, Lebron got owned multiple times on the defensive and offensive end. Mo Williams couldn't take any pressure off of him because he didn't play that well either. So what happens when your 2 best players shoot like crap and can't pass to shooters that are usually open like Gibson, Wally, West, and Z? You lose. This is a way bigger loss than it may seem. Everybody already knows the Cavs will be in the Conference Finals against the Celtics. The Celtics as much as I hate to say are a good team, they play better defense than the Rockets do and if the Cavs don't get home court advantage in the playoffs vs the Celtics, their screwed. I knew the Cavaliers offense power was a fluke. They depend way too much on the three, let Lebron handle the ball way too much, don't play at a higher tempo like they should be, and have some of the most inconsistent players in the game. Those players can get you through the regular season but can't get you through the postseason. LJ and Mo can't do it all and that third option would have been nice to have for the playoffs. Lets see how the Cavs play versus the Spurs tomorrow... another big test. Here is too hoping that I'm wrong and the Cavs just had a "off" night as I'm sure all of you die hard Cavs fans think.

20090226204301AACOqTA	Sports;Cricket	Bowlers: What's your favourite "three card trick"?	Obviously every situation and every batsman is different, and you can never premeditate these things, but in general, what's your ideal way to set a batsman up?  Maybe you're a fan of the oldest "three card trick" in the book: bouncer, bouncer, yorker?  Maybe you've got your own...      The one I use most is: outswinger, outswinger, off-cutter.  Sometimes the third one is a slower-ball yorker, it depends.  My most memorable set-up was with the slower-ball, he was seething that he'd missed the first two, and I knew he was going to tee off, so I bowled a slower-ball on a juicy length, and his bat was nearly in line with his head by the time the ball crashed into the stumps.  Lovely!  It's best if you beat the bat with the first couple, it's hard to set a guy up when he's smacking you to the fence regularly.      So how do you like to do it?  What's your favourite plan?  When has it really worked for you?  Be sure to mention what you bowl (I'm a right-arm medium-fast swing bowler.)      Part-time bowlers welcome - we all roll the arm over in the nets, at least.

And if i get him on the floor all my anger is coming out my fist onto his face and im not going to stop. He has brutally beaten people up before and he did it to me once and i think its time for that to stop. But when i get him on the floor thats it, its done im swinging and kicking until im not upset anymore. So do you think i should or shoud'nt? I'm not trying to brag at all but the videos i've seen are devastaing. If i fight him he will have a bloody face and a broken nose. Are those two years of brutal beating worth me hurting him badly?

I have a Fobus paddle holster for it already, and I don't particularly like it. What I do like is it's construction. It's a very durable mold, not leather or nylon. It just locks the pistol in place because it's molded to fit it precisely. But I'm in warmer climates and I don't like wearing loose fitting clothes (I'm not a thug, or a clown). The best thing for me would be a vertical rig, since my arm would just cover up the bulge. I just need a good one. Leather is ok, a molded one would be perfect. I don't like nylon or synthetic fiber stuff. My last one (that was a good brand), ripped. So, any suggestions?

20081005090611AAp0hu4	Sports;Cycling	Cosa pensate delle MTB Single Speed?	io sono passato alla MTB single speed          http://www.singlespeed-italy.com/HTML/po...        http://www.singlespeed-italy.com/HTML/po...       la single speed in quanto è senza cambio potrebbe sembrare che abbia qualcosa in meno, invece ha molto in più:      - è più affidabile e necessita di pochissima manutenzione, ed è molto più economica;   - è più leggera;   - è assolutamente silenziosa, non si sente la catena grattare o il cambio cigolare;   - si va meno veloci, ma il rapporto singolo allena e "arrotonda" la pedalata, cioè lavori di frequenza e fai fiato;   - una volta "arrotondata" la pedalata si scopre un modo più piacevole di andare in bici;   - con un single speed le salite al 20% sono impensabili ...all'inizio: con l'allenamento si fanno pure quelle. comunque se proprio trovi il rampone puoi sempre scendere dalla bici, che si spinge facilmente perchè è leggera, e nel tratto a piedi, tipo ciclocross, si va più veloci con minor fatica. in realtà il 95% della strada che percorri in bicicletta ha pendenza inferiore al 10%. poi, con il single speed salvi cuore e coronarie.   - per la scelta del rapporto bisogna seguire questa regola: la corona anteriore deve essere 1,8 il pignone posteriore (es. 36-20, o meglio 32-18);   - importantissimo, il telaio deve avere i forcellini posteriori ( o braccetti) orizzontali: così si puo tendere la catena tirando la ruota. se il telaio ha i braccetti verticali bisogna avere la fortuna di trovare un rapporto "azzeccato", con il quale la catena sia tesa, altrimenti monti un tendicatena da pochi euro ;   - per fare la ruota posteriore single speed, senza montare tutta la cassetta dei pignoni, dovrai sostituire quest'ultimi con dei distanziali, oppure devi prendere un mozzo filettato sul quale avvitare il pignone;       http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=c9vsFG2g14...        ultima cosa: quando vado in giro con il mio "muletto" single speed tutti mi fermano, mi chiedono informazioni, eppoi dicono "lo voglio anch'io!".

Who would you take out?   Who would you put in?   What's your Starting Rotation?      I would take out Christian Laettner, definitely. He was a star in College, but not so good in the NBA. I know he was a Rookie with Minnesota at the time, but seriously, a Rookie? Another guy I would take out is Mullin. He is just not talented, in my own opinion, to be on the Dream Team. Two guys I would put in there are Dominique Wilkins and Gary Payton. Wilkins is exceptable, but most of you won't like the Gary Payton decision. He is one of the most under-rated players in NBA History. I mean, look at this (meaning the link below), it's amazing how he probably won't ever make anyone's Top 10 list, not even Top 10 Point Guards.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Payton...

I would get 28 touchdowns when my team gets to the 1 yard line and decides to hand it off to me. Seriously. I think he had two 30+ yard touchdown runs that season. Which is not really that good. Is he a good player, absolutly. Was he worthy of MVP that year, and the title of best running back in the game. Not by a long shot.

Instead of taking the picture right away, Porter took his loafer off and made the girl smell his foot.. The girl said she would do it only if Porter agreed to take the picture..
