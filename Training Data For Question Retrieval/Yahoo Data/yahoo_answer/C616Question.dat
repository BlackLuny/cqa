20080316164826AA304Eb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Figure this out for me ? :]?	okay so there is this guy who was in my lifeguarding class and it just ended today.   we flirted throughout the whole thing and were partners for everything. but he is kinda shy. so i figured he wouldnt ask me for my number because of this so yesterday i gave him my number.   literally an hour later he texted me and we talked for two hours and he was so sweet and said all the right things. it made me so happy because he's so different than most guys... esp. my ex. (thank god, haha)   but also, friday he told me he had a girlfriend but hes really upset because he never gets to see her because shes always working. (this is before we started texting) and so i was like mmkkk...      so then today was good. he waited for me and held doors for me, and hes just suchhh a genuinly sweet guy.      but my question is:   will anything ever come from this? I KNOW HE HAS A GF & I REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING UNTIL THEY ARENT TOGETHER.   does he like me? or at least interested?   damn hes so cuteee.

20080503020316AA2EISe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really want to make love to him, but is it a good idea?	The man I've loved for 6 years is moving back to the midwest for good.  There's always been chemistry between him and I but we've never consummated our carnal lust for each other.  I really want to make love to him before he leaves because I may never see him again....  But then again, I start thinking about my feelings.  I'm not one who takes matters of the heart lightly.....  If I were to sleep wth him I know my feelings for him would intensify making his departure even more painful.  I'm so confused.  I want to and then again, I'd like to remember him as the love of my life, the one person I longed for all these years but never quite had.  I think that if he and I meet again sometime down the road and realize we do not want to live without each other, it would make the lovemaking more special.

20080503073509AA0esvg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I don't know what to do anymore... I love him, but....?	Middle school sweethearts is what our families called us.  We dated when I was 15 & he was 16 (our birthdays are Feb 24th and Feb 25th.... he's a year older though...), when me being young listened to a girl who I thought was a "friend".  She told me lies and we broke up, and not even 15mins later they were already "dating".        But we are now 24 & 25, with a beautiful baby boy (only 2 weeks old), and 2 other children (one from a previous relationship from me, and a previous relationship with him) we had some years that we hadn't contacted each other since the "friend" incident.  I had an easy birth for my first child, and was hoping for the same with this one.  17hrs of labor (au-natural) and he wouldn't progress past 5cm, so they did a emergency c-section.  Since I have gotten home, our relationship is "rocky".  He loves me, and I love him; could I just be going through some insecurities?  Post-partum depression?

20080516015609AA1gdCO	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Que pensez vous de ?a ?	depuis pas mal de temps je me demandais comment me débarasser d'une soi disant amie qui me faisait mener un véritable cauchemar. elle me faisait toujours culpabiliser, voulait toujours avoir raison, se vantait sans arret...    et là j'ai réussi à m'en débarrasser en lui faisant comprendre !   elle l'a mal pris bien entendu car elle ne supporte rien (elle ne supporte pas quand on lui dit non elle a l'habitude que son mec lui fasse tout et lui paye tout).    mais cette soi disant amie, je ne veux plus entendre parler d'elle.    bizarrement lorsque l'on avait des prises de bec, elle essayait toujours de réconcilier les choses et bizarrement depuis que les cours sont finis, elle ne tente plus rien. une copine m'a dit que depuis le départ elle se foutait de ma gueule. de plus cette meme copine m'a dit que je me tapais la honte avec elle, elle est sale sur elle, pue, n'a pas envie de s'investir. je me rendais pas compte de ?a mains maintenant je suis libre enfin !   que pensez vous de tout cela ?

20080521045319AAZde5K	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Qu'en pensez vous?	Bonjour,   J'aimerais connaitre vos avis!   Je remarque que de plus en plus de couples ne durent qu'au maximum 2 ou 3 ans, puis qu'ensuite l'un des 2 commence a s'interesser a quelqu'un d'autre, ou pense simplement a s'interesser a quelqu'un d'autre...   Moi personellement ca m'effraie un peu, j'ai l'impression que plus aucune personne n'est capable de rester fiable...stable avefc quelqu'un qu'il ou elle était censé aimer jusque la...et franchement j'arrive a ne plus m'attacher a quelqu'un vraiment, comme ca si finalement la meme chose se produit, je ne serais pas pris de cour,e t je serais "preparée", je souffrirais peut-etre moins...   Que pensez vous de cette tendance des couples a se separer de cette maniere?      (reponses débiles s'abstenir)      Merci!
20080611005152AAAg51z	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Preliminaires : avis d'hommes et de femmes?	Bonjour,   Mon sujet paraitra surment etrange mais bon tant pis, j'aimerais avoir des avis!   En fait voila, je voudrais savoir: lors d'une relation sexuelle, ou juste lors des preliminaires...et que vous, messieurs, pratiquez un cuni a votre partenaire...ne trouvez vous pas cela desagreable du fait qu'une femme lorsqu'elle est excitée, "mouille"?   Et vous mesdames, ne trouvez vous pas cela genant?      Vous me direz, pour une femme c'est la même chose lorsqu'elle pratique une fellation, mais je trouve que non car elle n'est pas obligé d'aller jusqu'au moment de l'éjaculation.       Voila, désolé de parler de facon plutot directe, mais bon on appel un chat un chat, hein. J'aimerais vos avis a tous sur ce sujet, bien sur pour les reponses crades, on s'en passera je pense!      merci.

J'ai quitt mon ex en dbut d'anne et il n'a mis qu'un mois pour se retrouver quelqu'un. Et pourtant, c'est un mec quelquonque sur tous points de vue. Il a rencontr une fille bien en un mois seulement. Elle fait du violon et il est super amoureux. Moi, il m'a pourrit la vie pendant 7 ans, je n'ai jamais eu d'amour de lui. Et il a russit  trouver quelqu'un plus rapidement que moi (alors que tout le monde dit qu'il ne casse pas des briques). De plus, ce n'est pas vident de rencontrer l'ame soeur aussi rapidement. Moi je le mrite aussi. Tout le monde dit que je suis pas mal. Je n'ai pas la chance de rencontrer quelqu'un qui m'aime vraiment. Il est pourtant go?ste, mauvais et froid ce type et il est  prsent heureux. Il ne le mrite pas, il m'a trop rendu malheureuse. Comment faire pour rencontrer quelqu'un de bien en un tour de main ?

Nos amamos e temos certeza q fomos feitos um para o outro e vamos nos casar daqui a 2 anos no máximo. O problema é q a m?e dela ? aprova o namoro,e sem motivo. só podemos nos encontrar nos fins de semana, das 5 da tarde as 10 da noite, debaixo do nariz da m?e dela. ? podemos nem ir até a esquina sozinhos.

20080802133328AAK3zsd	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	é normal sentir vontade que os própios pais morram?	As vezes eu sinto essa vontade, porque eu semprei gostei do melhor, gosto de me vestir bem, sair para lugares sofisticados e os meus pais nem sempre me d?o dinheiro para fazer isso, mesmo eles possuindo condi??es financeiras para isso, eles dizem que s?o futilidades e que eu devo me preocupar com coisas mais importantes.Eu tenho 19 anos, minha familia é de uma cidade do interior de SP, os meus pais pagam uma excelente faculdade para mim na capital do estado e todas as minhas despesas, me d?o uma mesada ,além de terem me dado um automóvel para me locomover.N?o tenho que reclamar disso, mas o que me deixa irritada é o fato deles n?o darem as coisas que eu gosto, por isso aproveito para ganhar um dinheiro extra, fazendo sexo por dinheiro, o que para mim é fácil, porque sou bonita e tenho uma amiga que também é colega minha de faculdade e que a noite trabalha em uma boate de luxo, ela me apresentou alguns de seus melhores clientes, que me pagam muito bem para eu fazer sexo com eles.Mas a quest?o é que me iniciei muito cedo na minha vida sexual(me iniciei aos 13anos) e perdi as contas com quantos homens eu já fiz sexo até hoje, fiquei com má fama na cidade aonde nasci e os meus pais moram, e dessa forma eles na primeira ocasi?o dizem que eu sou uma vergonha para eles e outras coisas do tipo, e que n?o d?o as coisas que gosto, me incentivando a fazer sexo por dinheiro para isso, eles me tiram tanto do sério que as vezes eu desejo que eles morram e dessa forma eu receber a heran?a e viver a vida que gosto. Contei isso para uma amiga e ela falou que estou errada em pensar dessa forma, mas eu penso as vezes apesar de amalos muito. Gostaria de saber se é ou n?o normal este tipo de pensamento meu?

Hace 4 meses rompi con mi novio , mi pareja ya que conviviamos hacia un poco mas de un a?o.      La relacion era excelente hasta que la convivencia se volvio molesta para ambos , fue cuando despues de separarnos intentamos un tiempo mas y cortamos a las pocas semanas.      El a los pocos dias empezo a salir con otra mujer que no es su novia, pero me sorprende la velocidad . ( se conocian hacia poco mas de un par de semanas)       Estando con ella quiso volver conmigo pero yo me negue.       Me lo oculto totalmente y los descubri.      Hoy dia seguimos hablando, yo realmente lo amo y quiero volver con el.

20080618201410AA9oQdk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	We can only text message: its hard enough to read them in person!?	Ok. I met the girl a few weeks ago at a camp. We've talked on Facebook and we text message each other. (she was starting convos the 1st week back, but now I'm the one who has to start a convo). The problem: we're both very busy. I can only talk to her through text messaging right now, unless i want to talk to her on the phone late at night-which i physically cant. I asked her if she wanted to go do something on Friday last week, she already had plans. I asked her today about this Saturday: she already had plans. I then asked her about next Saturday, and she said :"Yeah we can try for that."    The signs are obvious: she isnt interested, OR she loves to play cat-and-mouse. How the heck am i supposed to distinguish between the 2, especially since we can only communicate thru stupid text messaging?   btw, im very very picky about girls and this girl is a one-of-a-kind and we're not close, but it feels like we were at least meant to meet each other. (Not desperate, i can live w/out her.) Help?

We met up a few weeks ago n he was all nice etc n lied saying he liked me. Then admitted he just wanted sex, i continued to meet up with him because im an idiot and the last time i sat there crying he didnt do anything..i told him he was an idiot and slammed his car door and he said he never wanted to see me again.      In the past he has told me i am ugly, that he wants to slit my throat, that my friend has a bigger chest than me and that he wants her, that i am annoying (i am because i constantly text him) i just want to stop it and now he says hes barring my number. however he keeps asking me to sleep with him and i probably will i have no self confidence n even my therapist said it i was so upset earlier when he said he would bar my number i cried so much i ***** breath i feel like no other guy will ever want me. can someone please give me advice!!! i wish i was dead!!!!!! makes me so upset cus he used to care about me and i am nearly 17 btw..

20090201043958AAh71SD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do i feel this overwhelming attraction?	i know all he would really like to do is to be close to me or to make out with me every time he sees me. i don't think it's normal that we are so attracted to each other. i just think everything about him so is sexy. its just very confusing because i have asked him before if he was just after sleeping with me and he got really offended and was like "how could you ever think something like that??" the worst thing of all though: i couldn't resist whatever it is he wants. he looks like chris brown, he can sing, he can dance and he speaks portuguese <3 he does sports, plays the guitar, we like the same music etc etc... im really sure he likes me. he asks me to meet up every weekend. but we haven't yet. he always looks/stares at me and he complains when i don't talk to him. he tells me he really likes me and that im hot and beautiful. we talk on msn every day and when he has to leave he apologises a lot and sends me really many kisses. also he refuses to make out with me after i had alcohol because i might not want to and he says he doesn't want me to regret it. i'm not sure if i want anything intimate with him. i know it sounds insane but i'm just not sure. every day feels like the first day and i'm just not sure. do you think it's normal for people to be soo attracted to each other?

20070217223746AArxEb5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Namoro n?o é uma BESTEIRA???	Namoro foi criado por porcos capitalistas para que homens gastem seu dinheiro suado com idiotices. Eu n?o trabalho 10 horas por dia em uma usina nuclear para torrar meu dinheiro em besteiras como "namoro".      Um homem de verdade n?o precisa de nenhuma mulher e, se você está chorando por aí porque n?o consegue arrumar uma namorada, fique sabendo que você n?o está perdendo ABSOLUTAMENTE NADA, exceto um monte de besteiras, drama, caos, problemas e miséria. Se você precisa manter rela??es, é melhor se envolver com uma bela e macia ovelha que com uma mulher.      Se você for idiota o suficiente ao ponto de se casar, você pode ter certeza que perderá tudo, inclusive sua sanidade. Algumas regras básicas para relacionamento:      1) N?o se envolva com m?es solteiras.   2) N?o se envolva com mulheres divorciadas.   3) N?o permita que sua namorada se mude pra sua casa.   4) SEMPRE use preservativos. Após o uso, destrua-o para evitar que a mulher recupere o esperma para arruinar sua vida com pens?es alimentícias

20081116154323AA9LVR8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	For men only.. answer in details?	I want to get to know this person and see if I can like him for future relationship and marriage.  he is my colleague. I am 30 , he might be 35-37 years old.  sequence of events:  1. he admitted his liking to someone in his circle and it got to me through a mutual friend. Note, we still don't talk on daily basis, sometimes, we don't even say Hi to each other.  2.He tried to get close through emails, and sometimes talking to me when he sees me. I almost always gave a cold shoulder. I wasn't looking to date english man as I am worried that they never get onto commitment and marriage and I didn't want to waste my emotions on anyone.  3. but , he is very good looking, and after seeing him around a lot, i started giving him long glances, still no proper conversation.  4. then, one day, over the phone ( for work purpose), he openly got very rude with me , due to frustration.After the weekend, he looked extremely depressed.He held teh door for me, and then for atleast 3 days I saw him depressed and lonely.  5. then, he got better, and I started giving him even longer glances. And , he changed, he started to ignore me.  6. but, my long glaces were noticed by his friends, who told him that i look at him from the behind.Now, he purposedly came around to my floor at work and again tried to talk to me. I again pulled off and we could just say a hi to each other.  7. Now, there is another girl in picture.She is his close friend, I have always seen them together in lunch hour.She is only his friend. MAy be ex not sure. I think they both have been working in this place from 10 years. I think, after getting frustrated with me, he has again started dating this girl or may be he was always dating her on and off.  8. now, he and me are completely aloof. We just share work emails, and some glaces too.But, seems like he thinks I am not interested or have someone else in my life.     I feel little sad. Part of me says I should have tried to get to know him. I didn't have to get into sex and all, but I could figure out if he would be interested in long term. But, culture in Britain is diff , people don't ask straight questions and go through dating, then, living together and some never marry.  This puts meoff and I had to lose this guy.    Do you see any point in me trying to show more interest in him and trying to get to know him. MAy be , he's already moved on with his friend ( i can see them going on some common events on Fridays), and wouldn't want me anyway.    what does your experience tell you?

20060926121319AApInEK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Can anyone tell me what is up here?	ok, well a few months ago i found a friend of mine from a long time ago on the computer. We would talk a few times a day on the computer while i was at work and he was at school. at the time, i was having relationship problems with my boyfriend and we split up for a while. during the time i was split from him, i hung out with my friend when he came into town a few times. then he left town for like, 3 weeks to go on a trip. when he came back i tried to see him again and it didn't work out, then a few days later i got back with my boyfriend but i didn't tell anyone at that time. we were trying to work it out quietly. well all of a sudden, my friend stops talking to me completely. it just hurt me because i would try to just say hello and he would blow me off. i thought maybe he found out i got back with my boyfriend and i hurt him somehow...but it turns out he got back with his ex before i got back with mine. so i have no idea why he is blowing me off. did i do something wrong?

20070108084630AAyJiVY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HOT WOMEN ONLY: "Sharing"?	NOTE: I qualified this question because only really hot women with high expectations are going to be able to relate.      QUESTION: My girlfriend and I, over the past six (6) months or so, decided to begin picking up women/girls who are obviously flirting with both of us when we are out in public.  It's led to some mind- blowng sex.   However,  we have seven (7)  different carefully selected women/girls in our group now and  the demands placed on me as the only male in each session can get extreme. Usually, we have about 2-3 sessions, on average, per week.      Handling two and sometimes three women, two to three nights each week is great, but very intense and demanding.    The problem is that neither my girlfriend nor any of the other women/girls want any other guys in the sessions-- I'm 10 1/4 inches and considered exceptionally good looking (that's 1/2 the reason they are there in the first place along with my gf's incredible beauty. Because I perform all out, I'm tired.  Suggestions?

20070117215946AAckjKa	Family & Relationships;Family	Not able to love?	Growing up I didnt have the greatest childhood. My mother and father were always fighting(more of my moms fault i believe). They split when I was 10 years old. On a side note though I know they both love me very much. Especially my father, and my mom as well under her depression/anxieties. Today I live on my own, while I attend school. I consider myself to be a very kind, and caring person under my social anxiety. But, sometimes I question how truley I love my family and friends. Like I dont know how devastated I would be if they died. Maybe because we have just grown apart? I mean I have great respect for them and what not. I was just wondering this when I was contemplating finding a true love. Maybe my childhood made has made it hard for me to love. Whatever love is. I mean I tell my family I love them when I see them, but I dont know if it is real. I am considering seeking a professionals help. Any advice or wisdom in regards to this. Thanks alot- MIke

20070213190046AADovAo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Leia meu problema. Quem sabe me ajudaria a encontrar uma saída?	Tive um relacionamento com uma pessoa por um ano e meio. Eu a amo muito, a ponto de deixar uma vida de 10 anos nos EUA para estar com ela aqui no Brasil. Tudo corria bem, mesmo depois que descobrimos que ela tem um cancer, do qual está se tratando. Dei a maior for?a em tudo que podia. No pré e pós operatório fiquei ao lado dela. Trouxe-a pra minha casa para estar mais perto e poder dar mais assistencia. Um dia, sem mais nem menos, resolveu voltar pra casa dela no interior. Fiquei nervoso, e cometí a besteira de terminar tudo. Nao suportaria ficar longe dela sem poder ajudar diretamente. Reconhecido meu erro, tentei de todas as formas me aproximar novamente. Por msgs, emails e telefonemas, mas ela insiste em me ignorar. Apesar de n?o ser grossa me trata com indiferen?a e desprezo. Nem notícias sobre sua saúde me dá mais. Estou sofrendo muito c/ isto. Nao sei o que fazer: continuar insistindo para voltar ou deixar prá lá? Ela é depressiva e n?o posso afirmar que ela me ama. O que faria?

20070222103927AAJeBk7	Family & Relationships;Family	Why does she think I'm lying all the time?	My mama is such a criticizer. She's always suspecting something on me and thinks she know every thing I do. She thinks that she's right all the time. Sometimes I make myself look like a lier. though. Mostly I'll blush, smile, or whine. When I know I'm telling the truth I may whine, stand up for myself, or ignore her, but she just annoys me so much. I'm tired of her bull. I tell her 'What if I did it or not?", "I don't have to answer or tell u anything", "U can't whip me if I did, I'm an adult", or "Stay out of my business".   I'm tired of putting up with her. I feel that if a person doesn't say anything, you don't know if they're lying or not and a person can talk with out opening his or her mouth.

So I asked this question and got several answers from some girls. A couple said they have experienced guys breaking up with them because the guy said she was too good for him. So now, GUYS, have YOU ever done this? Or is that just an excuse? Do people generally TRY to go after people that are "too good" for them? Another way to word this question would be: have you ever just decided not to pursue or date a girl because she was "out of your league" and you thought that she would soon figure this out and would hurt you? Please share.

He's sixteen and I'm fifteen. <--16 in two months.   I didn't know she was there until Wednesday. Well, Tuesday,   he text messaged me and told me it was over and that he needed    time. I was crushed so I text messaged him back asking what I did or    if there was someone else?! He told me that there was someone else.   Well, I didn't talk to him much on Wednesday but,    he told me he was sorry for hurting me and if I would give him   a second chance. I asked if he slept with her and he said no.   Thursday comes rolling around and here he confessed to sleeping    with her. I was mad. Then he broke up with me again on Saturday    because something about him getting locked up and he didn't want   me to wait for him. Well, we're back together.      The question is should I be mad at him?   Because I'm more sad than mad.   I think that he really is sorry because he cried and stuff.   How would you feel and what would you do?

20070826001755AA1F3YJ	Family & Relationships;Family	Está tudo t?o sem gra?a, será que eu tenho algum problema?	Como eu disse na pergunta anterior, estou achando que tudo está sem gra?a, entediante mas tem uma coisa que me deixa muito feliz e quase que me isola do mundo externo: A música.      Seja ela qual for. Rock, Pop, Dance, Trance, Reggae, qualquer coisa me deixa muito concentrado e feliz ao mesmo tempo.      Como terapia, resolvi mexer com mixagem de músicas. Em compensa??o, nesses momentos eu me sinto muito bem, muito feliz. Sinto mais gra?a estando fazendo o que eu gosto do que conversar com esses colegas que eu disse na pergunta anterior (adolescenteszinhos futeis).      Outra coisa que me deixa muito empolgado é viajar. Conhecer outros lugares diferentes, outras culturas é muito legal. Ano que vem vou me mudar de novo! Estou feliz por saber que eu n?o vou morar nem um ano aqui.      Acho tudo repetitivo muito entediante! Quero sentir o sangue correr nas veias.      é isso que faz a vida ser menos entediante. Vocês n?o acham?

Hoje, Senhor, agrade?o pela noite maravilhosa, pelo cobertor que me aqueceu,    pelo meu alimento, por mais um dia de trabalho.   E principalmente por mais um dia de vida.      Aben?oa Senhor, os meus amigos e inimigos, porque eles também precisam de Ti.      Aben?oa, Senhor, o meu amigo que está lendo esta mensagem agora, assim como    aquele que me enviou.

20070520133132AAmLPkf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Minha namorada perguntou pela 3a vez se poderíamos adotar o ménage! Estou perplexo e preocupado. Me ajudem?	Olá! Ontem minha namorada perguntou se gostaria de fazer ménage-à-trois (transa a três). Como se isso n?o fosse uma sugest?o chocante o suficiente, essa foi a terceira vez que ela mencionou a idéia! Estou namorando sério com ela e pretendo noivar com ela no final de ano. N?o sou conservador ou "certinho", mas simplesmente abomino e sou contra a hipótese de ter um terceiro elemento enquanto fazemos amor. Diabos, ela até havia falado sobre isso antes e deixei claro que isso estava fora de quest?o. Só que mais uma vez ela diz a mesma coisa, imaginando que agora o resultado seria diferente! Ela se explicou dizendo que me amava, confiava em mim e nunca me trairia. Além disso, ela disse que é preciso ter muita confian?a no parceiro para falar de fantasias e querer p?-las em prática. Poxa, ela disse que poderia até chamar alguma mulher, mas parece brincadeira! Estou chocado e decepcionado! Ela falou que n?o queria que pensasse nada de mal dela e coisa parecida, mas estou chateado. O q fa?o?
20090205122949AAOHK1W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advice with Girls?  plz?	alright..Hes some back round info: I'm a sophomore in highschool I'm tall( not ridiculously tall), musclebound ( got an 8-pack, pecs, whole 9--yards), and good looking ( i don't mean to sound cocky, even though i probably do) but I'm pretty shy. There is this girl right she is drop dead gorgeous and really nice, we really don' t hang out much, outside of school, but we have common friends. I like her a lot like when i see her like i forget to breath, my hearts skips a beat, i know it sounds corny, but its true, I've talked to her a couple times, and i think she likes me back, or at least attracted to me, when we see each other in the halls she gives me the whole look up down thing, or we just make eye contact and smile, and say high to each other. However she has a boyfriend who is a senior, and he is a real asshole, and doesn't treat her the way she should be treated. I have no problem waiting for them to break up ( They have before, but got back together like a week later), and i know to give her some time once they do.         Can anyone give me any advice, or some conversation starters to help me with talking to her more, and getting to know her better?      Thanks in advance

20090205101257AAmG9Lz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I move out and keep the relationship? Or stay?	I am debating if I should move out of my our apartment. I have been living with my boyfriend for 2 years and we have a good relationship. The only thing is, he has not has a job since October and I am thinking it's because I am paying for everything right now. I know that they say for richer or poorer, but we are not married! I also kinda feel guilty about that as well. I know that he does some freelance things, but it does not pay hardly anything at all. And the money that he does get, he gives most of it to his kids mom, which is OK, but he forgets that I am here also, working my *** off to feed all of us and keep a roof over our heads. I am also in school, and have 2 kids of my own. I am trying to be supportive and everything, but I'm burnt out. I fell like he is way to comfortable with me paying the bills, so if I move out, but keep the relationship, maybe he will be more motivated to get a job? Please help!

20071009010150AAHCYco	Family & Relationships;Weddings	O que muda depois do casamento? O que mudou na sua vida?	As responsabilidades do matrim?nio   O casal namorou durante anos, antes de assumir o enlace matrimonial. Enquanto o ato n?o se concretizava, os pombinhos viviam em clima de romance. No entanto, depois que passaram a conviver sob o mesmo teto, a realidade mudou e as discuss?es passaram a ser freqüentes. Quem nunca ouviu uma história parecida com essa?    é muito comum marido e mulher, após conviverem sob o mesmo teto, come?arem a ter discuss?es constantes. Porém, segundo a psicóloga, essa é a chamada “fase de adapta??o”, na qual est?o se conhecendo mais profundamente. é neste momento que descobrem algumas manias, como, por exemplo, o homem que deixa as meias jogadas pela casa ou esquece de pagar as contas, ou a mulher que fica muito tempo ao telefone ou reclama de tudo. “S?o coisas que só s?o possíveis de perceber quando passam a morar na mesma casa.”

N?o há meio-termo possível. é preciso   Que tudo isso seja belo. é preciso que súbito   Tenha-se a impress?o de ver uma gar?a apenas pousada e que um rosto   Adquira de vez em quando essa cor só encontrável no terceiro minuto da aurora.   é preciso que tudo isso seja sem ser, mas que se reflita e desabroche   No olhar dos homens. é preciso, é absolutamente preciso   Que seja tudo belo e inesperado. é preciso que umas pálpebras cerradas   Lembrem um verso de éluard e que se acaricie nuns bra?os   Alguma coisa além da carne: que se os toque   Como no ambar de uma tarde.

20070427161725AAdiVPG	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Qual a pior prostituta. Aquela que atua como profissional, ou a mulher casada que trai o marido?	é sabido que existem muitas mulheres casadas que traem os maridos por algum motivo: Falta de dinheiro, falta de carinho, cansa?o por ver o marido embriagado, por ser espancada diariamente, por serem traídas também, outras trai por que n?o tem coragem de enfrentar a vida sozinha, e muitas vezes por puro prazer. N?o faz parte dos meus conceitos este tipo de comportamento.  Eu considero tremenda falta de capacidade para enfrentar a vida, muitas vezes por medo de amea?as, outras com medo do que os outros ir?o falar, e a maioria por que n?o querem perder a gorda mesada que recebe todos os meses.  Nestes casos elas preferem manter um triangulo amoroso a n?o lutar por seu sustento e viver uma vida digna.

Afinidade é sentir com...   >N?o é sentir contra...   >Nem sentir para...   >Nem sentir por...   >Nem sentir pelo...

Afinidade é ter perdas semelhantes e iguais esperan?as.    é conversar no silêncio, tanto nas possibilidades exercidas quanto das impossibilidades vividas.

Para mim o segredo da felicidade está em se manter sempre amando, manter o cara??o batendo forte.

20090205122509AAircFD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to deal with office rumors?	Apparently last summer, I fell asleep at the pool while tanning.  Unbeknownst to me, a certain part of my anatomy became, shall we say, awakened, while the rest of me was dosing off.   I've heard today that while I was sleeping a woman (I still don't know who) noticed this and became fascinated by the size of it.  She then got her friends to walk by for a closer look.  Then apparently she realized she had seen me at work (I still don't know who this is).   Anyhow, I never knew this happened until today, when someone overheard her talking about it, and then told me.   So now there's apparently a rumor floating around the office (about 1,000 people) about my equipment.    Now I'm generally a pretty desperate person, so I'll take what I can get, but I do not want my generous endowment to be the reason women are attracted to me, as I want a woman who is more interested in more important things.    On one hand, I'm somewhat flattered, but on the other, I'm extremely embarrassed, as I'm not that kind of guy.  I can't imagine that kind of rumor would spread too far in a professional setting, but what should I do if someone brings it up again?

20090205114837AA7LHzM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i tell the guy i like him or wait and see how he feels about me (we are friends)?	ok here's the thing i like this guy that just got out of a long distance relationship with someone his been with for about 4/5 years now (i know that's a long time!) i had feelings for him a while back but i knew it was wrong since he was with someone, but know i think i got a chance.         Lately hes been acting too nice, he always wants to know what i think, i have caught him staring at me for a long time, when i talk to someone he pays attention to what i say, he doesn't leave me alone when hes around(always right beside me). i don't like to get in his personal life so i don't  talk to him about the girl unless he asks me or he brings the subject up.       some people tell me he like me but i want to think that but Honestly Do you think he can get over the other girl in like a month or two?  i doubt it.       i try not to let him see that im into him cause im really shy, but i think he is getting the idea. i don't want to ruin our relationship either so..... What should i do? What would you do? Has this happened to you before? I need advice!!!! Thanks in advance for your answers.
20090205123134AA0BC5a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I say to him?	I met this guy last weekend at a church retreat. He seems like a nice guy.    The other day, he added me on facebook, and on my wall, he wrote," Hey, I'm looking for a Valentine. Would anyone like to be my Valentine? =) 10 more days to go!"    I assume, he is asking me on a date on Valentine's day.      The thing is...I don't know him, and I'm not attracted to him...I do want to get to know him better.    By the way, I went on a date once. I guess, I don't want to get into any relationship right now. However, I tell myself that I should go, just for the sake of experiencing the dating world.    I'm thinking of just going out as friends, nothing else.    Well, some of my friends are hanging out at hollywood on Valentine's day, so I guess, he and I can go together with my friends, does that sound good?   My questions:      1. Should he and I go on our date with my friends?      2.What do you think this message mean, "Hey, I'm looking for a Valentine. Would anyone like to be my Valentine? =) 10 more days to go!"?

20090205120019AAQweXj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was this girl expecting sex or was I out of line.?	I was over at my gf house and we were watching cartoons. She said she was going to take a shower.  10 minutes when she was done she walked out with the towel around her and sat down on the couch.  I was kinda surprised but she sat down while I was watching tv and she said "Whats up"  I said a lot.      I didnt quite know what to do so, to make a long story short I put the moves on her and we did it anyways.  'The real question I have is, do you think she was expecting that and that is what her intent was or did it come to a surprise to her.  The sex thing.

20090205103514AA8NaSs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really like this girl with a boyfriend, am I going about this right (please answer)?	Yeah, I know I'm an idiot so you don't need to tell me. But I really like this girl. And she's been having a rough time with her bf for a while, so it's probably just a matter of time before they stop seeing each other (they are drifting away from each other; but I don't know if she'll stop seeing him). Right now I just talk with her occasionally but I'm trying to hang out with her more so we can get to know each other better (but we've both been busy so haven't had much success so far). As well, I don't try to put down her bf or compete with him in anyway, I doubt that I would win if I tried (she obviously has an attachment to him). I haven't told her that I like her yet since we don't know each other that well yet. Am I going about this the right way?

Tem mais de um ano que frequento o consultório dele e tem mais ou menos esse tempo que sou interessada por ele..pra falar a verdade desde o primeiro dia que o vi senti algo diferente.   Mas só agora resolvi assumir pra mim mesma que sou completamente apaixonada por ele...e é incríveeeeel...meus dentes nunca deram tanto problema pra eu ter que frequentar tanto um dentista. Pode ser pisicológico isso ...      Ele é muito simpático comigo..talvez seja assim com todas...eu o olho diferente...falo diferente com ele mas n?o consigo passar disso..n?o consigo jogar indiretas nem nada..é um ambiente muito formal para isso! Ele tem msn..já tentei descobrir de todas as formas e n?o consigo.    Tá dificil dar o primeiro passo.      Mas eu sou capaz de tudo pra poder ficar com ele.         Por favor me ajudem..me aconselhem... o que devo fazer????

20070615033654AAlL36I	Family & Relationships;Friends	A polícia prende e a Justi?a solta. Por quê: Interesses políticos ou falta de provas?	Muitos corruptos, criminosos e gente envolvida em falcatruas e quadrilhas de todos os tipos s?o presos e, em alguns casos, soltos pela Justi?a. O argumento, muitas vezes, é por falta de provas, o que tira um pouco da credibilidade de quem solta. Afinal, o acusado já é o principal suspeito de algum crime, embora a realidade seja bem diferente. Em muitos casos, o inquérito é mal feito pela polícia.       Com o processo incompleto ou sem provas concretas contra o acusado, o juiz é obrigado, sob pena de responsabilidade, a soltar o preso. O problema pode estar em nossas leis, que permitem brechas, bem exploradas por advogados, para a soltura de criminosos. Mais do que nunca, a Reforma Judiciária torna-se cada vez mais urgente no País.

Em 2005 deixei minha familia no interior (pai, m?e, avó e irmao) e vim para a capital em busca dos meus sonhos (que est?o se realizando). Infelizmente nesses ultimos 3 anos minha avó e meu pai faleceram e meu irm?o está cheio de problemas conjugais e dá muito trabalho para minha mae (ela vive triste com as atitutes dele). Ela agora mora sozinha, vive da pens?o do meu pai (o suficiente para ela se cuidar e até viajar) numa casa enorme, correndo muitos riscos. Ela n?o tem muita saude, está muito triste, n?o há ninguém da familia por perto, meu irm?o só sabe ir na casa dela para pedir dinheiro emprestado e brigar com ela. E eu? Continuo aqui na capital em busca dos meus sonhos... E minha m?e? Ela nao quer vir morar comigo pq nao gosta da capital... Ela está "abandonada", morando sozinha, pedindo ajuda. O que fa?o? Abandono tudo? (faculdade e o emprego em uma multinacional) e retorno para o interior para cuidar dela?

20070313005138AAQCk3j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm in a long-distance/long-term relationship with a military guy.?	We've been dating 1.5 yrs, but have only been physically together maybe 1/3 of that time.  We're both fully committed to the relationship, but we won't be permanently together for another ~2 yrs.  I'm finding that I miss the physical aspects the most (e.g. hugging, kissing), and my friendship with a close guy friend has become more physical (i.e. wrestling, tickling).  I feel I'm compensating for what is missing in my relationship with my boyfriend, but I would never cheat on him.  EVER.  At this point, we have very limited contact and cannot use webcam.  I don't want to give my friend the wrong impression, but it's nice to have that companionship.  Also, I hang out with this friend every few weeks or so.  Am I wrong to be doing this?  Any suggestions about getting over missing the physical part that isn't in my relationship?  Thanks.

20070328121854AAzqXij	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Preciso de uma luz. Ajudem-me!?	Essa é a primeira pergunta que fa?o no Yahoo Respostas. N?o conhecia. Achei muito legal.   Estou precisando de conselhos sobre meu relacionamento com minha namorada. é o seguinte: namoro há 1 ano. Com 3 meses de namoro acabou rolando nossa primeira vez, que pra mim foi a primeira, mas pra ela n?o. Ela é uma mulher experiente e já teve muitos relacionamentos. Eu sempre esperei pela mulher ideal, mas acabou rolando com ela. Na época eu n?o gostava tanto dela, mas acabou rolando, porque eu estava me sentindo um "estranho no ninho", pois tinha 25 anos e era virgem. Ela n?o sabe que minha primeira vez foi com ela. Eu tenho dúvidas se é correto um cara inexperiente estar com alguém t?o experiente. Eu noto que às vezes isso pesa, sobretudo quando o assunto é "ex". N?o seria melhor procurar uma namorada na mesma condi??o que eu, para que aprendamos juntos as coisas? às vezes me sinto um trouxa por estar com ela, sobretudo em lugares públicos, onde ela sempre encontra os "amigos" das baladas.

20070329113719AARvIKu	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do? Mother v.s. me?	When I was 12 years old I met Brian on a cruise and found out he lived just a state away from me (about an hour and a half) and my mother said I could visit him. We ended up having a falling out but before we did I had started talking to his best friend Phil on the phone and online. I'm now 19 years old and I've been promising both Phil and the guy I met on the cruise for the past 7 years that I would go visit them. Every time I tried my mom would make up a stupid excuse why we couldn't (even when on several occasions we drove right past the town they lived in). I'm now old enough to go visit him on my own, and I told my mom that I was but she flipped out on me. She told me I didn't know them well enough and it was as stupid as going to meet someone I met online and that they were going to rape me and etc. Both of my friends still live with their parents and I might even have to camp out in the backyard because of how strict they are. Should I go, or does my mom have a valid argument?

Ele me convidou pra ir no cinema 2 vezes, mas n?o rolou beijo mas ele fez quest?o de pagar minha entrada!   das 2 vezes que fomos ao cinema ficamos horas conversando logo depois da sess?o, a gente fala muito um do outro, ele se mostra preocupado comigo, me liga pra saber se cheguei bem em casa, ele dá umas indiretas bem discretas pois notei que ele é reservado ele me disse que n?o é tímido mas age como se fosse.

20070415103418AAIDyxK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	O que significa? Ele ainda gosta de mim?	Meu ex olha muito pra mim. Desde que acabámos n?o conseguimos falar pessoalmente um com o outro. Falamos apenas no messenger. No meu aniversário me ligou e no dia seguinte na escola quando nos vimos n?o conseguiu me olhar na cara, ficou olhando pro ch?o. Me olha muito de longe e quando eu nao vejo ou estou de costas. Eu ja tentei que nos reaproximássemos mas ele nada. Diz que se sente esquisito a falar pra mim mas n?o sabe explicar porquê. Perguntei pra ele se me vê como uma pessoa normal e me respondeu que "acha" que sim. Os amigos dele muitas vezes me perguntaram se ainda gostava dele, mas se era eu a perguntar desviavam o assunto. Ha uns tempos deixei mesmo de dizer 'oi' quando nos víamos e ele no messenger se tornou meio rude. Quando estive com seus amigos ha uns tempos e com ele no café ele nunca conseguiu olhar na minha cara, tava muito calado e so olhava pro ch?o. Isso quer dizer que ainda gosta de mim?

But, he broke up with me saying he still loved his ex fiancee. I took that seriously and asked if we could still be friends. He texted me last week end while I was at drill. I texted him back when I got it, and we were just talking about the drill I had just got back from because he is in the Army National Guard as well. Then I asked why he was takling to me and he said he was thinking about me, I knew that was wrong so I asked him "Arent you supposed to be thinking about your girlfriend?" He told me she left him. I basically told him that sucked and I knew he was just crawling back to me and he could kiss my butt. I know I did the right thing, but I feel like I didnt. What does everyone else think?

20070828022717AAbQGWK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How does this sound for trying to get some answers out of him?	Ok if you read my post from earlier you may understand whats going on.   My fiance came home when it was almost 11. He was here for about an hour or two and he is now gone. Probably won't be back in until morning or in a few hours.   Anyway, I think I'm going to give his cell phone a call and ask him " what his problem is" or why he can't just stay home with us or at least our daughter And telling him that I really want to leave him because of this, but I can't cause I love him with all my heart(which of course I do). I'm hoping to not start arguing with him, which usually ends up happening.   I just want some answers.   He'll most likely say something like I'm being too "grouchy" or something. If he even answers his phone.   so what do you think?   does that sound good?   is there anything else you think I should throw in there?

Or if he's that obsessed with me (I don't mean to sound concieted, but I'm really nice and have a great personality) and he gets to know me, do you think he'll become more obsessed with me? Is that dangerous? Please tell me what you think! 10 points for best answer! :)

20081004065433AA1vdJW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUY TROUBLES: WHICH GUY DO I ASK OUT?!?!?	Ok, so this guy, Jeff, i gave him my number. He seemed really like OMG WOW!!!! But then he texted me saying "thanks but im going out with someone on saturday". But then he had to cancel that. Well i REALLY like him...totally crazy about him. Then, he tried to set me up with one of his friends (ewwwww). Then he tried to set me up with one of his cute friends, Ted. So, ted really likes me, and i think he is totally adorable. He's really shy, and wont talk to me much, but i am working on that. So i would go out with ted if i knew that jeff DIDNT like me, but i am too afraid to ask jeff, cuz i dont want to hurt our friendship. WHAT SHOULD I DO? GO OUT WITH TED OR ASK JEFF IF HE LIKES ME?

20081004123119AAtccWB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Whats Wrong with me, why am I feeling like this?	Theres a Girl that Has hurt me more than any other girl.. we Were once in love, I had such strong feelings for her, I gave her a second chance, but she lied to me and went for another guy, and then Came back to me after he cheated on her when she told me she wouldnt come back to me. All my friends tell me to stay away from her. She munipilates me, and treats me with disrespect now, saying I dont understand Relationships better than her. But for some reason Its hard for me to let go, I always get like a weird feeling in my heart when I hear her name, kind of like a anxious feeling but i cant explain what it is. I dont know how to make her get out of my head, all she does is play with me now, And I want love in return.. Its very tough for me to let go, and She told me that she still likes me, and that makes me feel even worse about the situation. Whats wrong with me?
20081004130137AAneM0T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I found a picture of another girl on my bf's phone. He says he hasn't seen her in 3 years. Why is he lying?	He supposedly met this girl at church camp about 3 years ago. But, these pictures of her and him together look awfully damn recent never mind the fact he never had them pictures on his phone before. She lives 3 states away but he went out of town about a month ago, to illinois. She lives in Indiana, which isn't too far at all. I also find it weird when he was gone he ignored my calls for a whole day. He says he was visiting his dad, but I truly believe otherwise. I have no proof but them pictures look way too recent. He's lying to me and I can't really prove it. What should I do? I'm really hurt by this...

20090205094647AAhSOMl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The right time to say "I <3 U"?	I've been seeing this boy for about a month now and I can rapidly feel my heart falling for this guy! In a conversation when we first hung out, I had asked him if he has ever been in love with someone and/or told them that he loved them and he replied with a "no" but assured me that I was someone he could see himself doing that with! Last weekend in a sort of sarcastic yet serious tone he pointed out that "he can tell I have feelings for him" and I did not respond because I was completely shocked that he was able to detect! And it's the truth! But the thing is I'm not sure if he is/has fallen for me as well, I mean I sort of get a vibe from his behavior around me and such, but I'm not positive if he loves me or would even take the initiative in saying it first! Do you think I should go ahead and tell him my feelings and if so, how long should I wait to confess?! I'm really nervous about this so any advice would be really great! =)

20090205100857AAzRA1l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dont know what I should do?	My girlfriend has been out of state, and is coming back for a week pretty soon. Though recently I kinda feel like she doesn't care if she talks to me anymore. I feel if i don't text her or call her first then she wouldn't bother talking to me.    I kinda want to talk to her about what im feeling but at the same time I don't.       I mean she's coming back for a week so we can see each other in about a week or so, and I know she cares and wants to see me. So it seems a little dumb that I would bring this up when she is coming to see me.    Im lost, I don't know if i just feel this way because i miss her a lot and am getting a little angsty or needy so im dumb or if it's the way i feel because of simply i feel she doesnt care if we talk anymore.    What do you think? Should i talk to her, or is it just me? Please need some honest opinions.
20090205101514AAVIwse	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i progress with hot office chick?	Girl I work with in office. She dresses revealingly or in tight clothes. When we started work together I would avoid body contact.She would sit close, touch my hands when exchanging a pen, sharing the mouse and so on. At one point I started fooling around with her and she would not object if I were to accidentally rub my hands up her arms sightly below her armpit when no one was looking. if we had any work related argment she would sit closer to me or rub her legs against mine under the table. then some guy was proposin to her (not known to me) and she increased distance. i protested why shes changed. she again sat close. she took me with her to a meeting room once and there while working she rubbed her breasts on my elbow. she was grinning. i was slow in my responses as this was office. after that she again increased the distance. she broke up with the guy who proposed. shes worried about what others talk about her. i assured her everyone likes her still.shes not letting me come near her again most of the time. occassionlly she lets me touch her when no one is listening as long as it looks accidental. i asked her to come with me again to same meeting room and tried to touch her thighs etc but she withdrew and did not talk. when i said i feel bad she told me not to as i am just being normal. we keep working together. i want to grope her take her out and play with her body. but there is so much distance now. seein her daily is makin me desperate. how do i progress. on top of all this she does not work properly.

20090205112412AAFOf7Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I broke this guys heart, now I can't stop thinking bout him. HELP!?	So there is this guy (we'll call him Adam) I like a lot and I used to date him and another guy. Instead of making it official with the him, I made it official with the other guy(we'll call him Jeff). This was 2 1/2 years ago. I broke up with the "Jeff" recently, and now started talking to "Adam" again.     Since I talked to Adam again, I can't stop thinking about him. I always continued to like Adam all along. Thing is, I was having issues with my folks and so I went to stay with Jeff for a few days because he let me crash there. I was stupid and told Adam that I was camping, but he caught the lie because I checked my myspace and he saw that. I regret that so much, and I know if he gave me the chance, I wouldn't lie to him again about anything. I was going to choose him, but I just needed to get away from the parents at the wrong time.     Now I'm 21, and I'm more mature. But Adam is still upset, and says he wants to be friends, but that he would be there for me, but that right now we can't have a relationship, but he's willing to try to get to that point. At least thats what I hear him saying- about later he may be able to be with me.     I understand where he's coming from. I just need to know, how to be patient and wait. And if I even want to if he wants meaningless sex.   I do get the feeling that he does still like me somewhere in there, cause he did tell me at one point that he misses me, and to call him. I have the feeling that he is just trying to hide it, or it's dormant. What do you think? How do I wait for him patiently and not scare him off, what do you do when you like someone and are waiting? And third, how do I go about gaining back his trust? answer all 3 for the 10 points

20090205120120AAIrG2A	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GIRLS...PLEASE HELP!?	I'm 18 years old, a freshman in college. My grandma's best friend has a realllllly cute granddaughter and she's applying to the same college that I'm at, so our grandmothers had her in touch with me and I gave her some advice on the application, essays, interviews, etc... She came up to visit and stayed with me for the weekend- that was the first time I met her in person...we had a great time, she loved the campus, and this college is now her top choice. She applied early decision and got deferred, meaning she won't know until April whether she's in or not. In the short time that I was with her, I felt a really strong attraction to her- both her looks and personality seemed like everything I could want in a girl. So now, I'm back at school and we're 6 hours apart from each other...We've texted a few times since then briefly about stuff related to college, but sometimes we'll just have like a fun conversation after starting by talking about colleges, and she'll use lots of smileys, exclamation points, and extra letters (likee thissss!)......What should I do now about her? I really miss her but I can't exactly make plans to hang out while we're this far apart. Also, I don't want to like annoy her or creep her out if I text her more frequently, so I'm not sure how to go about this.

I really really really want to go out with him, but he loves Lauren and I want to know if theres a way I can get Lauren and Max to break up, and get Max to go out with me. Please help me!! It's so tempting because, I have 5 classes with him everyday and he usually sits near me and Lauren is also in the classes and he distracts me so much whenever he and Lauren talk and just by his cuteness! PLEASE HELP ME!!! 911 911!!! SMS!!!! THAT MEANS SAVE MY SOUL!! HELP!!!
20090205120635AABbcQw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I would like to know about my love? Need help urgently?	Right i know some of you are just here to answer questions. Yet im in a real predicament. What should i do? My problem is that i had recently been cheated on by my partner. She is the world to me. She then blamed it on me. She got into contact with my father and he gave me a right thrashing. After that i moved out at 17 years of age. With only my savings and well im at college. She had got me into huge trouble. To top that off my brother/cousin died {suicide}. I am drinking a bottle a night. This is Absolut Vodka as well. I really need some help. I never did this before i even tried topping myself. Right. Back to this my love said she really misses me via phone/txt. I love her so much but i know she would break my heart again. She killed me. I will never trust her or anyone for that matter. This is not a small relationship {e.g. going out for a month}, I am a sensitive guy. I mean well im so bloody hard to look at but so soft inside. Please tell me should i try again? Should i trust her? I do love her but logic indicates no. We have broken up 3 times now. Yet they were not as bad. This is the worst. Sorry for the novel but an answer would help. thank you.
20090205120637AA9hazj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	It's not you, it's me...?	I met this guy from a dating site about 3 weeks ago and in the 2nd week we thought we'd give a relationship a try. We'd both been in a 3 year relationship previously and had been single for 6-7 month.       So anyway, he was very enthusiastic about it and was telling his friends, asking me to spend time with him. After that week though he suddenly stopped messaging me on the phone, MSN and generally being cold.  Every time I would message him on MSN he would seem distant and eventually he goes offline without saying anything and he kept doing this for some days.      Then yesterday he FINALLY messaged me, because it was killing me, I knew something was wrong, but I didn't know what. I didn't want to message him to much because I know he has a lot on lately. Then he decided to tell me "I need to tell you something, it's not you it's me" then he started saying stuff like that he suddenly "lost feeling" and "didn't know what he wanted" because he said "London has changed him and that he feels like he doesn't mind being alone". He said he was being cold on purpose because he wanted me to get a "hint" but that didn't tell me what he was thinking until he said so (in which I felt so much better when he did). He said he had trouble expressing himself and "didn't want to hurt me" but he hurt me more by NOT saying anything.      So we are meeting tomorrow, but he said he didn't want any serious talk and just to enjoy the evening and said if we decide we want to see each other again and again, he is ok with it, but he said let's start as "friends". I asked him one more question and said "If it was me personally or if he didn't want to be with anyone in general" he said it was the latter.      Do you think his reasons seem genuine? Genuine that it was "too fast" for him and that he got scared?
20090205120905AATfrcE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Could it mean something, or just a coincidence???? I'll pick a best answer?	Well I really like this girl that goes to my school, and I'm pretty sure she likes me too, and if she doesn't ... she at least thinks I'm cute.      But we're always bumping into each other, like we're always at the same place at the same time, and we're usually alone .. i think it's really funny, could it mean something, or is it just a funny coincidence?

20090205122246AArpkC8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you get over being cheated on? I'm worried he is but then again I'm not.?	How do you get over being cheated on? How do you get a guy to prove he wont'? I've been cheated on by many guys with many different girls. I didn't know till it was too late. They all said the same things, I love you i wouldn't do that to you. You're the only one for me, things like that. How many months did they drag it on? I'm in my 6th month of a "clean" relationship. clean meaning i haven't been cheated on. Maybe. My boyfriends myspace got cleaned out so he had to go request all new friends.(before he had a lot of hot girls as friends but i didn't care because I thought he never talked to them cuz they were old) And they are all girls for the most part. Girls I find much hotter than me and a threat. He has deleted a few I have talked to him about. the others he says he knows from high school. But we live in oklahoma and some are from alaska or pennsylvania. He also gets a lot of txts and a lot of calls from odd numbers he won't let me see. I'm scared I'm paranoid and picking stuff apart but I've learned I have to from previous relationships. he says all the above things and I'm somewhat reassured. But i'm still so leary about all of it. I don't want to tell him he can't have any "girl" friends, but he messages them all "thanks for the add. your very pretty and seem very interesting. I'd love to get to know you better. Hope to hear from you soon." What do you get from these type of messages? I'm really scared. I love him lots and I want to trust him. Is this wanting what is making me reassured by his words? I'm in college so i'm not some silly heart broke high schooler whining about drama. I'm actually really scared. I'm so scared I've thought of death and how much easier it would be than this torment. He always answers with... nothing. She's no one. Just an old friend. You have nothing to worry about. I'm scared I'm being stiff and protected, hiding, because of what has happened to me so I'm not giving in or believing him. I need some serious help.   13 hours ago - 3 days left to answer.    Additional Details   To be fair he has done more than previous boyfriends. One night he got a txt from a girl named victoria and he was asleep so I asked if I could see who it was and he mumble "sure baby." well then she asked if he wanted to go do it. so I told him that and he said "again. omg I am getting so tired of her. (he was still very sleepy) he kept saying over and over "its not fair people are doin this to me. to us. stupid retarded people." so I told him it was okay and I trusted him. and he kinda started crying and said "no its not okay. you don't believe me. you don't believe me. I love you. she's that one girl that my little brother txted." i kept sayin it was oky and he kept sayin no its not you don't believe me. (but mind you she is like 15 and he is 21 so I'm just wondering he is saying it because of her age and he doesn't want to because of the age) grrrr :(   well not a lot of boys. its a lot to me because I've been raised up with the mind i need to have only one partner. i've had 4 boyfriends my entire life.  He is very supporting of me and comforts me and does almost impossible things for me and helps me whenever i need it. And I mean big expensive things like fixing my truck, borrowing stuff from people he knows for me to use like biggers trucks and trailers. Its just stuff I've seen before happenin again and he really is just a big friendly caring loving guy I'm just suspicous because of my past.

20090205171845AAA8oUP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is it that guys who like taken girls always tell them bad things about their boyfriends?	I have this friend, his nickname is Fluffy. He's a great guy and all but these past few months hes been getting on my nerves. He liked me ever since we've become friends and still now I think he still does. I feel flattered, but he wants me to break up with my boyfriend really bad. I love my boyfriend and actually we are engaged to be engaged. But Fluffy keeps coming up with stupid things to try to get me to get pissed off at my b/f. He seems to think that since he hugged another girl (who has a boyfriend) that he's cheating on me. I trust my boyfriend, but how do I get my friend to stop saying ****? Every time I confront Fluffy about it he gets all pissy with me and says that my guy is an ***.

20090205173915AAfoaXD	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to politely tell her to stop calling?	She calls me 3 times every single day. Seriously, I'm starting to get annoyed. My sister tried to get her to stop calling (they don't like each other) but all my friend does is insult my sister. She's a great friend but she needs to stop calling me all the time. My parents are getting pissed and my dad is very annoyed. If I "accidently" hang up she'll call right back and ask why I hung up. I don't know how to tell her to stop calling. If I did, I would instantly feel bad after. Help?      P.S. When I seem dull and lifeless on the phone (partly because she calls me so much) she always asks "Jeez, you don't sound like yourself. You seem so boring like you don't want to talk to me." And all I want to do is scream yes! She makes it seem like we can never fight and always have to talk to each other and no one else!
20090205165809AAQZEvc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I am getting absolutely serious and need help with this. Please Answer?	My bf and I are 19, we've been together for 3 years. We are in university and see each other once a week. (we live in the same city...like 6 km apart)   Anyway, today when I saw him we were goofing around and he starting talking about having a threesome. He brought it up in the past (long ago) and I always got a little angry. Then I started playing along and said I would like another guy. But he says, no another girl...he doesn't like the idea of me with another guy. We were joking and he picked up on the fact I was mad.       So today, once again I laughed about the idea and said "Fine, if it involves another guy!" And obviously he said no. Then he is like, pick a girl. I was in bed, eyes closed...briefly answering him. And kept asking and started going through his phones and suggesting all the names. (there weren't any particular one) After a while when he noticed that I wasn't talking much, he stopped. And said " This conversation is making you mad isn't it..."       Whatever when he was dropping me off at home, he was talking about threesome, AGAIN!. This time, I just kept quiet. When I was about to get off the car, he tried to kiss me, and i pushed him away. And I said, "thanks for ending the day with talks of threesome". He said he loves me and he is sorry and that he was being stupid.      So, really is he just joking or what? We have been together for a long time and we love each other... What the hell is this alll about. I am still really mad. Guys, what would you say??

20090205174209AA94WfQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is hair down there really that bad?	Okay, I want to start off by saying that yes I am seriously asking this. I’m not trying to be funny.    Anyway, it is common knowledge that women, and now men, are expected to be groomed, and not shaving or waxing is thought of as gross. And I have been having a little bit of a problem with figuring out how I want to go about this, because I am…well, a pretty hairy girl. Even keeping up the bikini line is difficult. And I read another question the other day asking how much to take off, and a lot of people said to shave ALL of it. First of all I think that is weird. Why would you want to look like a 5 year old? But, I also don’t think people realize how difficult that would be to keep up. So, I guess the point of this is just to see what people think. Is it really THAT important to you? Would you still enjoy sex with someone that is on the hairy side (not because they don’t keep it up, but because of their genes)?

20090205173751AAEdKpP	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is having close relationships with your family worth it? Is having kids worth it?	Family relations bring up so many problems, especially if you're naturally a kind of difficult person, like me. Is it even worth it? Also, is it normal to be 90 to 100% sure you don't want to have your own kids? Is anyone else (or anyone you know) out there like this, who's "normal" in other ways? I know it's a rational decision for me to either get my tubes tied or just decide not to have kids, but I have clearly diagnosed psychological issues. I think these issues are affecting my thought process, but on the other hand, having these issues means I have all the more reason not to reproduce. Also, I don't think I could ever really afford to raise kids, especially if they turn out like me. Thoughts?

I asked her "Have you ver taken pics in a bikini?" And she said BIKINI is different cuz its for swimming.    It makes me so angry! She's being so judgemental, and I try to bring up points but she's like "Well I grew up conersvative, it doesn't justify that! I don't want to be friends with someone who is a slut!"

20090205165425AAoSsep	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The guy I'm seeing won't spend the night at my home?	We've been seeing each other exclusively for 4 months now, and he has already spent he night at my dad's. Granted, no one was in the house and my father doesn't know about it. My mother, on the other hand, (parents are divorced) has no problem with him spending the night, knows we are sexually active, etc.       When I asked him if he wanted to come he kind of argued with himself in the car saying he would really like to, that it sounded great, but that he has too much respect for my mother to sleep over there because we would (presumably) have sex.      ...How about we just don't have sex that weekend? Big deal!       The reason I want him to come over badly is because, in order to spend the night together, we have to go to hotels- which add up - since I can't go to his parents, who I haven't met and apparently have a terrible relationship/drink, etc. And he cannot come to my place because my roommates are nosy as **** and I don't have my own room as it is.      How can I convince him? Is he serious about the respect-for-my-mother thing? He has not met her, but almost did for dinner- didn't happen, due to some date/time confusion.       Or could it be that since, we are not officially in a relationship (although most of the elements are there), he is afraid this would symbolize too much commitment?

She has lived in Texas and says she "lost' the papers he sent for her to sign and mail to him.

Okay, so before I say anything one thing has to be clear      THIS IS A LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP.      He lives only three hours away, which isn't so bad, but it's just so you know that I can't just show up randomly at his house.      Okay, so I want to keep track of what my boyfriend is doing online. He recently got a new laptop and I am worried that he is going into chat rooms and the like, you know doing things he shouldn't be doing. Going on webcam with other girls in chats...      SO! I was wondering if there is any way to keep track of his whereabouts without consulting the history, because as we all know history can be deleted. Is there like a back up history that I could us (he wouldn't know that) or is there like a program I can use? Can I make it so the only way to delete history is to type in a password? A program that sends me an email for each site visited?      I wont be using it for long, I just need some reassurance. It's eating at me.

20090205171443AAmTBrF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When do I know he's "The One" ?	I admit asking a bunch of strangers is probably a bad sign already, but here's the thing: I'm 25 and have been dating my current b/f for going on 4 years this Feb. I love him, but there are times when I really doubt I can see myself being with him for the rest of my life.       So many of my friends have known that they had found "him" in less time than this, so I wonder if I should've been hit by the lightning bolt by now. He's a good guy, but can get argumentative and constantly rants to me about his problem of the day, which then invariably turns into remembering ever bad thing that happened to him when he was a little kid. He does drugs and so does his parents and other family members and friends, which concerns me about bringing kids into that kind of environment. He's told me he quit, but he's lied to me about it before.       I know I'm not perfect either, but he's so sure he wants to marry me one day and I can't honestly say I feel the same way all of the time. What are your thoughts?

He was supposed to get it taken away after 2 quarters but since my dad saw "big improvement" he said he could keep it.      what should i do?

Finally I gave up, it was a bigger nightmare than life is right now. He is enrolled in anger management, but rarely goes. There has to be some solution that doesn't make my children's life a living hell too. There has to be something I can do.
20090205165533AA2e7TU	Family & Relationships;Family	Worried about my brother. help please?	my brother is 14 years old, almost 15. since he was young, he's always done things over and over again (he decided he liked clocks at 6 and was literally OBSESSED with them. at about 11 it was the playstation, and now the computer. He finds a food he likes and refuses to eat anything but it, no matter what we try.)      the first thing im worried about is his behaviour. if we try to get him off the computer he can get violent, throw things, punch etc.      he will not get off the computer easily. on schoolnights me and my mum finally manage to get him off it by hours and hours or trying everything we can, when we fall asleep he will come back downstairs to play on the computer.      he is so tired in the mornings, he cannot wake up for school because of staying up so late. my mum and i try everything we can to get him to school, but because of his absence, my mum is being threatened with prison. (he says he 'feels sick' so teachers can not force him to come into school, and we cannot literally drag him, he is taller than us)      this scares me so much, im 16, and worried about my mum getting into trouble because we cannot pay the fines (about ￡1500) for him not being at school.      he REFUSES to eat fruit or vegetables, and has done since about 7. he finds something he likes to eat (like cheese/ bacon/ cheese sandwiches and will eat nothing but it. if something is touched by sauce, he wont eat it and will scream and break things until he gets it.)      believe me, my mum is NOT a pushover, and i try to help her as much as i can, but im getting so behind in coursework from being more worried about family stuff than homework that i get detentions at school for two or three hours every day.      sometimes my mum drinks to calm herself down, but she gets angry cos of it. her bloodpressure is very high due to stress, and they said it was dangerously high last year.      it just seems my life is really screwed up, and any suggestions on what to do would be so much appreciated.      by the way, i dont have the heart to get my brother in trouble by calling the police or anything. and we have taken away the computer and disabled playstations, he just breaks things and hides our stuff until it becomes unbearable and we have to give in (he threw my ipod in the sink and broke it, smashed my mobile, his my mums handbag..)      he's not disabled in any way we are aware of.   our dad was violent when we were born but when i was 3 and my brother was 2, my mum got divorced. we still see him sometimes but my brother hates him...making the excuse that he 'feels sick' to get out of seeing him quite often.      do you think the fact my brother has no male role model could be effecting him?      im sorry this is so long      thanks so much though

20090205173657AAt3Wf7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is my husband so upset with his birthday gift?	It was my husband's 24th birthday last week.      A couple of weeks before his birthday, his truck started having engine problems and he expressed his desire to have a new truck for his birthday.      So, the day before his birthday, I sneaked out of the house to go on a little birthday errand.  I went to our local Dodge dealership to look into purchasing a new Dodge Ram, where I nearly fainted when I saw the price of those things.  Oh my goodness!  I did not know they were THAT EXPENSIVE!  I began to rethink buying him a new truck.      I left the dealership and headed to a make-up store, where I bought a couple of different kinds of make-up that I liked very much.  I figured that he would like this gift very much, as he might like the look of this expensive make-up on me.        So anyway, I came back home and left it in my brand-new (and also very expensive) Ford Expedition.  In the middle of the night, I snuck out of bed and to the garage. I retrieved the make-up, wrapped it up in a very nice, pink box with purple wrapping paper and a bright yellow bow, and put in on top of the good of his truck. As I finished and locked up for the night, I thought to myself, "OH, I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THE LOOK ON HIS FACE TOMORROW!!! "  I then went back to bed, hardly able to sleep, as I was very anxious.      Well, the next day finally came.  He woke up to the smell of a hot waffle breakfast along with sausage, eggs, and an ice-cold cup of chocolate milk, his favorite.  He seemed very pleased, saying, oh, you are the perfect wife!!!  We then made out for 5 minutes.  After breakfast, we took a very nice, hot shower together for about an hour.  We took a trip to the beach later that day, and we spent some good time together.  As the day ended, we headed back home.  I, along with a little of his assistance, made him his absolute favorite meal, grilled steak grilled with honey-Bar-B-Q sauce. It was an incredible dinner, the 2 of us absolutely loved it.  After dinner, we had a great 2 hours of sex without a condom (I think he got me pregnant).        Then, it was time to open presents.  He had to go to the bathroom really fast, so I sneaked out to the garage really fast to make sure everything was ready.  This was going to be perfect!      So, my husband was standing right beside me, and I said, ready to see you gift?  He couldn't wait, and I led him to the garage. I could see the excitement building in his eyes, and he said to me, oh, you shouldn't have, honey!      I put my hands over his eyes as I took him into the garage.  I turned him to the direction facing the gift, and said, "One... Two... THREE!!!"      I moved my hands and he just stood there, shocked. At first, I though he was excited, but then he just said, "Oh."  He opened the present, and at first, I thought he really liked I had gotten him, but then he turned around and slapped me in the face really hard and said, "Why did you have to get my hopes up so high!?!?!?"  He stomped his way back inside the house, and I later heard him crying in the bedroom.      He hasn't talked to me ever since, and he still wont talk to me.  What did I do????????????

20090205163749AA8ykvc	Family & Relationships;Friends	What can I do for my drug addict friend?	One of my closest friend is battling a serious heroin problem. He's 22 years old, almost 23, and has already "quit" numerous times. All his friends are worried about him, and he doesn't have too much family left. He keeps telling us that he's still working on quitting, and refuses to go to rehab. It's immediately obviously when you talk to him whether or not he's been using recently, and we know he hasn't come anywhere close to giving it up.      I think it would really help him quit if we could figure out why he felt the need to separate himself from the world with heroin in the first place, but he also refuses to seek psychiatric help to get to the bottom of his problems. All I know is that he's felt really alone since the unfortunate death of his little brother in a car accident a little under two years ago. All his friends have tried to be there for him, especially with his birthday coming up next weekend, but we're all busy people who have work during the day and classes at night.      What worries me even more is what might happen if he actually is able to quit. He seems really wound up and excited when he's been using, but gets depressed in between. He's had some history of suicidal tendencies, and I don't know what he would do if it he didn't have substance abuse as a crutch.      The more I think about it, the more I wonder how he even has the money to support his drug problem. He doesn't work right now (he was just fired), and he has plenty of expenses to deal with, including child support payments, and his parents cut him off when he was 18. I'm concerned he might be doing something illegal to make ends meet and still have enough for his 'habit.' He always says he doesn't even have enough for simple entertainment.      That's really his whole story, and like I said, his birthday is next weekend. I thought maybe I would get him an xbox to cheer him up, but I also know he had his eyes on a new TV. Any other good gift suggestions? I really can't decide. Help please!

20090205164016AAMnyhq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need my bf to start helping financially. How do I talk to him?	I bought a house in Oct and my bf moved in with me. He was already struggling financially then he lost his job for over 2 months. I supported him and he did not pay any expenses (rent, utils, food, entertainment..). He got a job just before Christmas but the pay is low (30k). He pays child support/healthcare for 2 boys, truck payment (almost $500), and credit card debt etc.. He’s been working 1.5 months now and still he has not helped or paid me a single dollar toward our expenses. It’s been more than 4 months now. Every time I bring up money he gets very defensive and upset. He truly is barely scraping by but still can’t afford to contribute at all. I make twice what he does but I am suffering financially from this. Our household expenses and my mortgage are $2200. I’ve cut everywhere, stopped my 401k, started racking up cred card debt. He finally got some money in Jan from unemployment ins. and a freelance job ($800) but did not give me any of it. I tried to talk to him again last night and he freaked out. I feel that he should make sacrifices too (refinance his truck loan, stop getting $140month nutritional drinks) but he doesn’t want to. I’m at a loss. Why should I make all the sacrifices? How can I talk to him without getting him so defensive? I know he is in an awful position but I need him to start helping. How can I make him understand?

Im 16 and my best friend totally changed this year of high school.(im in 11th gr), I never drink, and she has started drinking all the time and is "popular" now and is nice to my face, but she is soo rude behind my back. I dont ever go out of my way to talk to her, but if i happen to see her in the hall or something i am always nice! so i dont get why she suddenly doesnt like me so much! On facebook she removed me from her top friends, when i used to be  1! and now she has even added me as a limited friend so even if i wanted to talk to her, i couldnt! I have made new friends and I try not to let her rudeness bother me, but im a very sensitive girl and im upset and want her to get a taste of what a jerk she has been! I happen to know her parents would ground her for eternity if they knew she parties all the time! is there a way i cud secretly rat her out, or should i just stay out of it??!
20090205164619AAmFyvK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Has this married woman treated me fairly?	I met this girl last year and at the time I was engaged - but hadnt heard from her in the longest time - and so this girl and I we became the very best of friends.      Quite early on in this friendship she started flirting with me and getting me excited I admit I was surprised at this time went on and she admitted how she often thought of us two making Love.       And I admitted to her the issues I was having in the engagement to which she was at first very supportive of and in one piece of correspondence said how she would do everything to make sure my life was never neglected after my break up.      She then admitted having feelings for me and very strong ones at that it was around this time she ceased contact with me.      The contact since has been sporadic in which I've heard how she is planning on seperating from her husband and wants out then tonight she said.      "You're needy"   "I only talked to you because I thought you were engaged"   "You're a great guy and I wish you all the best"   "I know you're lonely but thats not my problem."      She didnt mention anything about the flirting or admitting masturbating while thinking of me though.      Even before I met her my fiancee rejected me and it looks like this girl has.      So not fair at all - just because shes unhappily married and wants out she treasted me like cr@p.      Karmas my friend on this am sure, if she is sh!t scared of her husband and worried about him getting angry over any of her slightest things then what am I to think anymore.       Shame it was a good friendship :(

20090205165250AAtLvR7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What to do with a husband?	who never thinks he's wrong and always wants to blame me for anything and everything that goes wrong? Let me explain...whenever I try to tell him something is bothering me, he brings up ANYTHING he can think of to turn it on me. He does what he wants, when he wants, and how he wants to do it, and NEVER discusses anything with me. He has been continuously using money to start all these small buisnesses and telling me AFTER the fact...but I can NEVER use any extra money for anything. He knows that I need to file bankrupcy, I need medical insurance, and I got a short term loan for my engagement ring for us to pay rent (a few months ago) and still don't have it back! He did finally start paying for me to go back to school...but that was after months of complaining that I have NOTHING and picking the cheapest school possible.    Now..more to this. We can't get a house because our credit is so bad, so my parents got us a house, are fixing it up, and renting it to us. The ONLY thing he has said about this house is how HIS son (from a different marriage) is excited about some stupid play yard in the back. My parents are starting to notice these things! I am getting the feeling that he is only in this for the fact that my parents still take care of me...because he won't...and my parents make sure stuff is paid and we have a home. He is only worried about himself, his son, and his family. We have been married less than a year and he WAS NOT like this before...I swear..he wasn't. WHat the heck do I do???
20090205171840AARcVW8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a girlfriend and a girlfriend's girl-friend problem?	My girl and I have been dating for a more than 7 years, so we are comfortable. But recently she brought up the idea of including a third person in our sex life (a girl). Now normally when if I heard this news I would think I am the luckiest person on earth, but the girl she has in mind is someone from back in the day before we were dating. The girl had a huge crush on me back in high school - almost to the point where I was the last person to find out about it.   My question is: Should I go through with it? Yea my girl and I are comfortable enough to share each other like that, but I dont want this girl to get the wrong ideas. Furthermore I dont want to be anything that drives these two apart. I would not ditch my girl for her friend.       She is not even my friend - should I care? Women worry about this **** more than men do- is it possible they already worked through all this?

I have a 12 yr old son, very athletic. His dad is not involved at all. My boyfriend loves to coach. The problem is that he likes to train other kids instead of my son. It drives me crazy. While he is coaching some other people’s kids, my son is sitting home alone after school. When I confront him, he says I’m jealous and that I am trying to control him.  I don't want to force my son on him, but it is very upsetting, specially because my son does not have a dad. I thought my boyfriend would be doing this kind of father-son things with him.

20090205171333AAK0fuF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Have any of you had this dating dilemma?  I know this is the marriage place, but you may have advice?	Ok. I am 19 years old and I've never had a boyfriend. Not because I don't like guys, becaues I've had huge crushes on plenty of guys. I don't know why but whenever a guy actually likes me back then I get really scared and I therefore never have had a boyfriend.       NEWEST DILEMMA:   I met this guy and I've talked to him 3 times and the third time we hung out and I was TOTALLy crushing on him and I had butterflies like you woudn't believe and that night I couldn't sleep becaue I had butterflies and I thought I was inlove!! well, the next day I saw him and apparently he likes me and now my butterflies have been replaced with a knot in my stomach of fear and I HATE it because I'm never going to get a boyfriend if this keeps happening.       So, I am wondering:   1. Have you had anything like this and what did you do and what was the result.   2. Why does this happen to me?   3. What do you suggest I do?
20090205171815AAcKlRf	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why do people fight others if someone "talks sh*t" about them?	Why does it matter if someone talks sh*t about you? 98% of the people you meet in your life are going to talk some sort of "sh*t" about you. Whether it's an opinion about you, or a lie. But is fighting someone because of that really necessary? What does that solve and what do you gain?     I am a pacifist, so I don't believe in fighting.. I don't believe there is any reason to fight ESPECIALLY over something as silly as somone not saying something nice about you..     I mean come on people. Grow up. People ARE going to talk about you. People ARE going to start rumors about you.. throughout your entire life. If someone doesn't want to 'be your friend' because they believed a rumor someone told them about you.. soo, let it be. Why does it matter? Why would you want to be friends with someone who is going to judge you before they even get to know you? That's dumb. It's part of life and we all have to deal with it.     Fighting over something like that is completely un necessary.    Besides, It's not going to matter in 10 years anyhow.

20090205172115AAPkVgs	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Screwed Up Wedding Anniversary Question? (7 Years)?	I have been married for seven years this Saturday.  The marriage has not gone very well over the past year and a half.  My husband went backwards as far as maturity and has become very irresponsible.  I was injured over five months ago at his parent’s house and we are still dealing with that.  I need a wheelchair for events where there is a lot of walking or standing and I am in constant pain.      My husband made plans for us to take our children to a parade in Tampa (Gaspirilla) it is almost like a Mardi Gras.  The parade is during the day and they through beads off of the floats (no nudity of fans) and the people catch them.  We all ready brought the children to the day parade (and they got a lot of beads and I was in bad pain after having to walk two miles with a ruptured back disk and a grade III ankle sprain on crutches and I am 31).  I mentioned going some place different because I just could not do the parade and he responded "The kids want to go to the parade".  Our children are 4 and 6.  I mentioned going to a place that there were wheelchairs and we could go to a nice dinner and the kids could go on some rides (Downtown Disney) and he got really rude.       We have NEVER had a good Anniversary or really any occasion.  He treats me like I am just the one who takes care of the children and that is it (never told me I was beautiful or anything else).  I love my children. But this man has not protected us, cared for us or provided for us.  He has let his mother talk to our children and I very rudely.  My husband has given up on our life so much that he moved us in with his family because he couldn't (or rather gave up) providing for us.  I was a Stay At Home Mom (and in college and do some freelance writing) that didn't have a choice to be one due to our daughters blood disorder (and did not mind).  Any advices on how you would you handle this if the entire time that you have been with someone you were just considered the caretaker of all (him, animals, his family, etc.).  I realize it's my fault for being naive years ago but what do I do now?

20090205173955AAF17cJ	Family & Relationships;Family	How does one recover from being abused in childhood?	As I have gotten older, I have realized that the way my mother treated me and still treats me is a result of her own personal issues.      She was and still is verbally and sometimes physically abusive to me even though I am an adult. I know the only way I can escape her behavior is to move out on my own, but right now I am not financially able to do so. I work full-time and attend college part-time.      I don't understand how she can call me dysfunctional when she has created the environment for a dysfunctional relationship.      The ability for me to trust or be in romantic relationships is non-existent. It's even hard for me to make friends.      Does she even have the right to be hurt that I don't tell her "Happy Mother's Day" or wish her a happy birthday? How can I when we have such a negative relationship?!      How does one recover from such adversity?

20090205173105AANLoug	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I attract older women if I look too young?	 http://i661.photobucket.com/albums/uu338...       I'm 34 years old.  The problem I have is that only younger girls are attracted to me, and they are too young.  I have trouble meeting women around my age.  Here's why:      I posted my pic and asked people to tell me how old I looked...      Here are their guesses from youngest to oldest.       17   18   19   20 -6 guesses   21   22 -2 guesses   23   24 -3 guesses   25   26      Well after 18 guesses... that's an average of 21 years old.  I'm 34!  I got a real problem here.  What can I do?  What age range should I even go for considering how old people think I am when they don't know me?      Help?  This is bothering me.
20090205173135AA7XWtu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please Help. I'm going nuts.?	There is some one I love very much. Unfortunately I am very shy around the person, and I feel as if all my energy is taken away in that persons presence. So it is very difficult for me to build any kind of relationship with the person, even just a simple friendship, because I am so shy. One day though I made myself tell the person how I felt. So now the person knows that I love them. Ever since I told that person, I have been treated better. The only thing that is so confusing for me is this... I am a girl, and so is the one I feel for. I do not know if she will ever like me the way I do, or already does. All I know is that I am not doing enough to figure it out... Every day at school is a struggle because I am so shy. I'm almost ignoring her because I am so afraid to go up and talk to her. I am afraid to talk to her because I don't really know how. Also, I am afraid to make any mistakes... I will only talk to her if she comes up to me. I rarely up to her. But I am trying so hard fight my fears and just go and talk to her. She comes up to me all the time, so why can't I go up to her? And she does come up to me... Even if I have been avoiding her. I mean, she is not stupid...     So What do you think of all this bull? Because I don't know what to think. I'm just so scared. I am scared of losing this person.
20090205173411AAHyQsJ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I am so confused on what to do..what do we do!?!?	my boyfriend an i have decided we are going to get engaged. i have told my mother an  she is fine with it. now, i live with him an his father (we are both 18) weve been bestfriend for a long while now an everything is perfect, we just thought now is the right time to move to the next step. The only thing is...his mom and dad dont approve. His dad has said that if we get engaged that we are no longer allowed to live in his house. We have 4.5 months left until graduation an we are going to leave to wherever college we go to, but we want to be engaged now. We dont want to get married right away. we are planning on staying engaged for ATLEAST a year and a half...but my question is, what do we do about his father?!?!
20090205173607AABtnTu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me, is he being nice, or is he just joking around?	Well there is this guy, he's been my friend for about a year.   We have English class together and today was our final. (He sits next to me by the way)      Well I used to like him at the beginning of the school year      And now I like him again.      Today during our final I started feeling for him again   It felt like he was looking at me, I wasn't sure, cause I didn't wanna look but I kinda saw it from the corner of my eye      He was pulling my hair, but not hard, and he joked around about the pants i was wearing cause I was wearing leggings.   When it got really quiet he looked at me for more than two seconds than I looked at him, and I smiled and he smiled back and said hows your day going? and I said good :] and I said how was yours? and he said "cold" (with a chuckle) cause it started to rain where i'm living and he was wearing shorts and a tee shirt. and i said didn't you know it was gonna rain? and he said yeah that's why i wore these shorts (his shorts were like the material of swimming trunks/board shorts) and i laughed (we we're whispering cause it was during the test and everyone was quiet) than later he put his head on my shoulder than i put my head on top of his for like a second. and than he like tickled my thigh and asked if that tickled and i said yeah and i did it to him and he said yeah it ticked and he said i'm mostly ticklish at the stomach, than we started poking each other for like five seconds. (at this point it was quiet anymore, almost everyone was talking) and he and this other guy got sent out      and i texted him and said      our texts      me: i miss you boo <3 haha   him: miss you too baby :( lol    me: wish you were here! =)   him: shhhh lets go hook up    me: haha okay, if mrs smith* lets me get outta here    him:be like please i need to go can i use the bathroom than imma be outside like 2 minutes after   me: haha she was gonna send me out too!   him: go ask   me: haha did you hear her yell at me? she wont let me i asked bob* earlier and he said she wont let anyone go   him:just ask, be like mrs smith* i really need to go, and stop being scared =))   me: haha i'll ask when she calls my name      he didn't reply after that.      and after my teacher let him come back into our class room he wasn't like that anymore, he seemed different and weird. =/      he got sent out to the classroom right next door to us, and there is door that connects both classrooms,         * - the name has been changed

20090205173626AAeZkTa	Family & Relationships;Family	Help! i haven't seen/talked to my dad in 17 years!?	My dad left my mom and i when i was 5. He basically traded us in for another family which helped him get richer. He signed papers saying my mom and i could move from germany to america. i recently found out that he tried to come and say goodbye to me but we had already left. I have recently found a way to e-mail him. He says he looked for me but i doubt it because i can be easily found online or for someone w/his money by any means. he says he always remembered he had a daughter even though he now also has a son. he never came to see me or even called me when I was young and in germany and my mom and i lived with my grandparents. i don't know how to act after all these years. i am afraid it will be awkward and all this will be for nothing and i will look like a fool for trying so hard to connect with the man who didn't care about me (trust me he didn't, small things he did that showed it like hiding my pics when another woman would come to his house). what should i do?
20090205173720AA0uL0A	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I file for child support or just suck it up?!?!?!?	My ex and I have been divorced for almost 10yrs now.  My son lived with her for the first 4-5 yrs, and he's been with me since.  I've never filed for support.  I've been recently considering it since he's now 14 and it's getting quite expensive.  When i ask for her to help out more, she whines and complains that she doesn't have the money.  Although, that didn't seem to matter when I was broke off my *** and she filed and made me pay $175 a week!      She does help out ONCE IN A WHILE with school clothes, and I asked her to pay part of his Dr. bills ($150 out of $800) and about half of a dentist bill. ($40 out of $200).  She does have two other children (9 and 7) by two other guys and the guy she is with isn't the father of either.  She's been married and divorced again (he wasn't the father either, LOL). She lives with her boyfriend and is also complaining about him having to pay support.   Anyways, I work 3rd shift (10 pm - 7 am) and my son stays at home by himself - he goes to bed as I'm leaving for work and I call to make sure he's up for school.  I mentioned about the support thing a while back and she started making my son feel scared to be alone at night and said "well, if I really wanted to get him from you I could because you leave him alone at night".   I have my next door neighbor that keeps an eye out for "suspicious activity", I have a friend that lives a couple miles away that is available 24 hrs, and My mom is available...she's abotu 7 miles away.   I guess I feel like I shouldn't file for support because that would put me on HER level when she used to drag me into court any chance she could to get more money. I also KNOW that she will use my son against me and make him feel bad and talk about me in a bad way to make it look like I"M the bad guy.... she already does that when I ask for her to help more!  i can just imagine what it would be like if it was court ordered!!

20090205174107AAARmWC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do deal with a fiance who wouldn't stick up for you?	My fiance lies to me about his ex girlfriend.  He talks with her behind my back.  He's emailing her cards and pictures they had together and all this stuff.  I've asked him to let go of that if he wants to be with me.  He says he has but i find out otherwise over and over again.  I don't know what to do anymore.  I've asked her from one woman to another woman to respect my relationship with my fiance but she just abuses me and tells me it's up to him to say that.  I tell him about it but he doesn't want to do that claiming that they're good mates.  what should i do?
20090205174150AAxybGh	Family & Relationships;Family	Please help me...I don't know what to say...?	Ever since I can remember my mother has gotten drunk almost every night. And it is extremely upsetting to not only me, but everyone else in the family. It is especially disturbing because my mother currently has cancer, and she isn't helping by drinking this much.    I've put up with her drinking for as long as I can remember, and now it's just pushing me off the edge. I am about to move out of the house because I don't want to deal with this crap anymore. It is affecting my emotional health, and worse, it's damaging my mother's physical health.      I want to write my mom a note telling her how much her drinking problem has damaged our family, but I don't know how to say it without hurting her feelings. The last thing I want to do is upset her, because I mean...Shes my mom. But she needs to know what this is doing to the family.   Please, if anyone has an idea as to how I should compose this letter....please help me. I honestly don't know how I am going to say this to her.   Thank you
20090205174206AAfM3Fv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think i am making the right choices?	My best friends brother's friend is super hot and really nice. I noticed him first but when i got her brothers number i kind of forgot about his friend. I really like her brother and he likes me too. He's four years older than me so dating is out of the question. We weren't doing anything yet except talking but we kept it from her and when she found out she was really angry. She got over it though because he and me were going to do stuff and her and his friend were going to do stuff. About a month later he told me he was going to have a girlfirend so he bascically dumped me. I was really hurt for a while but then we sort of got back together(not in the dating sense) i know he will have a girlfriend soon and I'm okay with that. I got Jake's number (his friend) the one i was originally interested in. He's way good looking and he wants to be with me (once again not in the dating sense) I was still kinda with the other guy. He's hot but jake is hotter, but honestly i love the other guy because he knows whats up. And yes i do like jake too. Do you think its ok i am going to be sleeping with jake if he is ok w/ it if ive already slept with his best friend because he told me he was going to have a girlfriend? And the other guy and me had already talked about me being with jake when i thought he had a girlfriend

20090205174754AAGDvbJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He cheated on me and left me alone?	Lately I was dating this guy for the last 2 months. Things had been seeming to go well. and then he kept getting weird about the commitment thing. He started to get freaked out when we started seeing eachother a lot...and then things got more serious.  I started getting annoyed by his behavior and didn't know what to think about it. Always pulling me close and pushing me away. At one point I told him I needed a little bit of time to think about things, and he wasnt happy about it.  I tried to apologize but then he just got really angry.  Eventually to my dismay, I find out now hes been seeing some girl behind my back for one month.  That explains how distant he has been in the last month. He was seeing her behind my back and I had NO idea about it.  I am so hurt  and the last couple nights i couldn't even sleep.  I thought he had feelings for me.  And only me. That's what he told me...I talked to his sister though after this happened, and her only response was "yeah thats mac." I guess he does this type of thing repedatively with different girls. And never settles for long.  So this new girl I have no idea what shes like. But i dont know i feel like hes not going to do it to her, and  I was the only one taking his crap.  Can anyone offer some comfort?

20090205184137AA1jwNV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is it that an average looking girl can get just about any guy she wants...?	Why is it that an average looking girl can get just about any guy she wants, (and she doesn't even have to have a car or a job) but an average looking guy has to try so rediculously hard just to get a date with a half-way decent girl?       I mean, I'm not shallow, and I'm sorry if I offend someone, but it seems like the only girls that like me are the ones that I'm not attracted to or interested in.
20090205182612AAG70Ct	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does he stare at me?	I sit behind this kid and and he sometimes turns around to stare at me. Well, today I went to sit somewhere else and I happened to look over at him and he was facing me and staring at me.

20090205180736AAUf83R	Family & Relationships;Family	Dads: Do you refuse to help with your young child or did you give up trying?	When you picked up your child, did she tell you that you were doing it all wrong, and take the baby away?      When you tried to change a diaper, did she push you out of the way, saying you were doing all it wrong?      When you fed your child, did she tell you that you were just making a big mess?      When you played with your child, did she tell you that you were being too rough?      Did she even notice how many times she diminished your ability as a father, but noticed to everyone within earshot when you were no longer trying?      This is the most common reason given by fathers for not doing anything with their child.  Is this you?

20090205175830AAQf61g	Family & Relationships;Friends	I have a friend question?	Alright, so I have a friend, who I used to consider a best friend.      We would always sit together at lunch, but then we started sitting with these other people.     For some reason she says she feels left out...but i don't understand why.These people are realllly nice, and they make me laugh. I told her she should try to speak up more. She said she would but still hasn't.     Then I missed a day, and came back and they said she didn't sit with them the day I was gone, and she didn't sit with me that day either.     Ever since she's been acting really weird around me, I don't know what I did wrong.     I really don't want to lose our friendship, cus it means a lot to me.         I know this probably doesn't make to much since, since you guys aren't really involved. But I need to know what to do.                            Any of your advice is welcome, thanks.

And on Wensdays a different lunch than the other 4 days.      So on Wensdays I don't know anyone at my lunch.

The guy: well i went out with this guy and its ryle cousin. and we did lots of stuff together we were really close. i loved him he was my best friend. we had been going on and off for 2 months now, and he just told me he started liking sara.  he told her that i called her a slut and a *****...blah blah blah...when i never did.((except when i really hated her)) so i sent her this text saying like--"why are you talking all this **** on me. do you not think i wont find out....so on and so on" and she was like i know it bothers you that "HE" likes me" and i was like " i know it bothers you that i got nomintated and stuff" and she was like well at least im not the one who *******************(personal stuff with my x)      and i was wondering how she knew about that.   so it must have been lisa   because she was the only one who i told.      i tried calling her but she didnt answer.   she was like what do you want?   i said i need to tlak to you   she was like if its about the whole sara i don't wanna hear it.   and i was like its about you stabbing me in the back   and she was like how   and i said you told sara and not just her what i did with (him) that was personal and i trusted you.   and she came up with some lame come back so i just said   well i think we need a break from our friendship.      im just so hurt over this whole thing.   im so lost and confused.   err!!      i really dont wanna loose any more friends.

He said I'll give you some stuff to do and teach you a lesson at the same time.      Being young and stupid I agreed.       (I should have paid attention to the learning a lesson part.)       I mowed whatever needed to be mowed, raked whatever needed to be raked and put up whatever needed to be put up.      I walked up to my daddy and said "Now you owe me."       My daddy said "As long as I owe You , you'll never be Broke!"      Daddy walked away smiling.  Stunned ... I just walked away.        I miss my daddy.  I wish he could have met his grand kids.  He would be proud of them ... I know I am!  (smiling)      The purpose of this true story was/is to share a positive memory of my father to those who may be going through some very tough times.

20090203065150AAt7NEk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I hate being kept a big secret?	So from when I was 15 - 20 I dated this guy.  And it was very serious and intense the entire five years.  But we were young and had a number of things that were not in common.      Anyway, sadly we broke up and a few months later I realized I was pregnant.  Both our parents freaked out!  My parents wanting me to have nothing more to do with my ex and his parents accusing me of getting pregnant on purpose to trap him (lol   as if).      Anyway.....so we went out separate ways.  And I had the baby alone and raised her alone.  He saw her once when she was 2.  And a few times when she was 10.  And has been paying child support since she was 10.   (Now she is 14).      But my daughter and I are big secrets in his life.  We are part of his past.  His mistakes.  And he tries to hide us from his life.      And it hurts us.      We dont go anywhere that people will know us.  We talk by his work email and I would never dare walk into his work or he would freak.      I know that we all make mistakes in our lives.  But why do I have to always be hiding out?

I am really distraught over the fact that it's hard for me to get my husband to want to spend time with us, his family (wife and kids), and when I do get him to go to a function like tonight, he makes sure to make everyone regret it with his negative attitude and nasty behavior. yet he has a grand ol' time going out with his friends but I guess we just annoy him. It makes me really sad and it's happened so much that I don't even want to ask him to go places with me anymore. who wants to be around someone like that? he's embarassing! he talks mean about people where they can hear them, he's just rude and makes sure everyone knows that he doesn't want to be there! I'm just so hurt that he seems to like being with his friends more and we are just annoying. I can't be around that kind of attitude, it's very stressful and certainly it stresses the kids to. how do I deal with this?

We have English class together and today was our final. (He sits next to me by the way)      Well I used to like him at the beginning of the school year      And now I like him again.      Today during our final I started feeling for him again   It felt like he was looking at me, I wasn't sure, cause I didn't wanna look but I kinda saw it from the corner of my eye      He was pulling my hair, but not hard, and he joked around about the pants i was wearing cause I was wearing leggings.   When it got really quiet he looked at me for more than two seconds than I looked at him, and I smiled and he smiled back and said hows your day going? and I said good :] and I said how was yours? and he said "cold" (with a chuckle) cause it started to rain where i'm living and he was wearing shorts and a tee shirt. and i said didn't you know it was gonna rain? and he said yeah that's why i wore these shorts (his shorts were like the material of swimming trunks/board shorts) and i laughed (we we're whispering cause it was during the test and everyone was quiet) than later he put his head on my shoulder than i put my head on top of his for like a second. and than he like tickled my thigh and asked if that tickled and i said yeah and i did it to him and he said yeah it ticked and he said i'm mostly ticklish at the stomach, than we started poking each other for like five seconds. (at this point it was quiet anymore, almost everyone was talking) and he and this other guy got sent out      and i texted him and said      our texts      me: i miss you boo <3 haha   him: miss you too baby :( lol   me: wish you were here! =)   him: shhhh lets go hook up   me: haha okay, if mrs smith* lets me get outta here   him:be like please i need to go can i use the bathroom than imma be outside like 2 minutes after   me: haha she was gonna send me out too!   him: go ask   me: haha did you hear her yell at me? she wont let me i asked bob* earlier and he said she wont let anyone go   him:just ask, be like mrs smith* i really need to go, and stop being scared =))   me: haha i'll ask when she calls my name      he didn't reply after that.      and after my teacher let him come back into our class room he wasn't like that anymore, he seemed different and weird. =/      he got sent out to the classroom right next door to us, and there is door that connects both classrooms,         * - the name has been changed

20090205175917AAE1iP5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	When both spouse fell out of love, what to do?	My wife and I is going thru some very rough rides. 18 months ago, she told me she no longer loves me. She care about me deeply but the spark no longer is there. I can't accept that and tried hard to change and work it out. Things have improved but the sparks are still not there for her. What worst, my love for her are slowly diminshing too, I loved her dearly but the lack of reciprocating love have push me away to a point of giving up. We both loved our kids and I think that's are common bond. Also is our 20+ years of marriage that have great memories being together.    The uncertainty of separations and being out in the single world had scared both of us from being separated. But being together creates so much miseries (for me at least) that I'm ready to take that plunge into the unknown. I still love my wife and she still care about me ( to a certain degree). The economies and my unemployement also contribute to our falling out. I feel inferior and insecure. She is sucessiful in her own field of works and are constantly being out there meeting men that are established and well off. I feel real insecure about all this and we talked about it. She assure me everthing is on a professional level yet my gut feelings tell me me she is keeping an eye open.    Well, I'm rambling here but my question is, If a marriage is really on the brink of collapse. One side is trying while the other is floundering. Heartache, angers, distrust are free flowing. There are sliver of hopes but it's against big odds. Should I still fight for it? I really wanted to give up because it really drain my soul and energies..ANybody here still in their marriage due to feelings of fear of the uncertainty And are sacraficing their happiness and sanity just to be with their spouse ?    Yeah, i need to grow balls etc... But really, Are long term marriage that difficult to survive?

My body went back to the way it was for the most part, but for some reason I just don't feel pretty like I used to. I don't want to get intimate with my husband at all. I just feel like a different person. My hair is always dirty and pulled back and I hardly ever wear make-up anymore. I don't have much of a social life, cause I am a stay at home mom. I feel so unattractive. Is this normal and what can I do to get my old self back!

20090205181951AAjCsKy	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do I tell Her (read details)?	I've been writing this magazine editor in Chief about the magazine she works for, She said that she was going to send me the issue that i wanted for free since i was a huge fan of who they had interviewed in the issue, she didn't reply for a month and I thought she was just being rude. So I wrote her and said:      >> Did you get my last email? I've been waiting for your reply all month   >> long. I left a message at your phone number on your site, but I still   >> haven't received a call or email back.      And when she replied she told me that she did not receive my last email and that her house had flooded, she had to move and that it'd been a horrible month. I would still like for her to send me the pdf version of the magazine and the print issue like she said she would, but I find it rude to just ask now if I can have it after all that happened to her. Can anyone help me out and tell me something nice to say and still request her to send it to me? Thanks

20090205182601AA0P8lW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he still into me or not?	Been seeing a guy for almost a year.  He knows how I feel about him however I am sometimes unsure about his feelings.  He tells me all the time he misses me or will miss me when I leave to come home and we chat every morning and talk almost every night. Problem here lately when we are together he doesn't want to do anything unless we are out with his friends.  No dating alone time. And his phone calls are shorter and not very personal like they used to be.  This is probably paranoia and I can't believe I am asking this being the age I am (46) but do you think he has become complacent or is he getting bored and restless?

20090203062150AAH9aXA	Family & Relationships;Weddings	My boyfriend and engagement...?	My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year and we are both 22. I've never been so happy and in love in my life. A few weeks ago we spent a few days in Paris, and everybody assumed that he was going to propose to me with it being the city of romance and all that - which I knew he wasn't because he got scared every time someone mentioned it! We had an amazing time in Paris and are closer than ever before and since we got back, he's spoken about engagement more openly, he doesn't change the subject, we've been shopping a couple of times and each time we pass a jewelers he drags me into it, saying we should look at rings 'for a laugh'. He tells me that I should have a really nice one. What should I make of this? Him proposing to me would be the best thing I could ever wish for but I don't want to build up my hopes. He said that being in Paris made him realise how much he loves me.

My fiance and I have been together 5 years. I am 21, live at home, and I still have some of my schooling to complete. Because of this my family does not want me to get married until I am finished, which means two more years. In all honestly we wanted to get married 3 years ago, but decided to wait, because of my family.       Now it is just becoming too much we want to spend time together and begin our life together as husband and wife. But my family keeps getting in the way and discouraging our plans.       So the plan was to get married this summer at city hall and later on when I have completed my studies have a large ceremony and reception.       I just need to know what to do, follow my heart and take this man to my lawfully wedded husband :) Or should I just listen to my family and wait the two years.  Please help!!!!        *some friends have suggested that we just move in together when I am in school and just get married after, But living together without being married is out of the question.

I've been in a relationship for 4 years with my boyfriend and i love him like crazy.. The problem is that I'm English and he's Australian. He's been homesick for a long time now and the only reason hes been staying in the country is waiting for me to finish my degree. Then he expects us to move to Aus, permanently.      If I don't go, its the end of our relationship (and he would probably kill me for making him wait all this time), which I dont want at all.. But on the other side of things, my degree is in european languages (not exactly useful over there), I'd be leaving my friends, my family.. everyone. And I love England... its home.

20090205182949AAq5iA6	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please help, guy friend problem?	My guy friend and I have gone through a lot over the last few months.   He has the tendency to flirt with me and sort of lead me on for nothing.   He is though one of the easiest guys to talk to.   I can tell that sometimes he really is interested in me, like he likes me but when it comes down to it he will say as of right now i just like you as a friend.      Well we haven't talked in a week. He thinks that if I don't talk to him first I'm mad at him, when that's not true, so basically he only talks to me first when he wants to flirt with me or whatever.      I saw him today, he stared at me like he was sorry for whatever hes done..   I miss him, I do. I want to try one more time to get things right but part of me doesn't even want to try because hes hurt me several times, but it hurts not to I guess you can say to have him in my life.    I don't know what to do.      What should I do?

20090205184012AAixbYJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I not getting the hint?	How would any of you guys handle this?      A best friend of my best friend is in the military. Since he has such a high status with my best friend, every time he is in town, we all hang out. When he's here, there's flirting back and forth and a real connection between us.       The last time he was here, I had to be at work really early the next day so I kinda shot him down when he asked me out, but I REALLY like him, it was just bad timing.      I'm friends with him on MySpace and even though he is in Iraq, he does log onto his page fairly often. I told him how I feel and that I really want to see if we could have something together and his response was "I can't do another long distance relationship right now, my last girl tore my heart out, but we'll see what happens when I come home in April"       Ever since then, I have sent him messages that he has read and ignored. Not even flirty "I think I'm your girlfriend now" messages, just.. How are you? what's it like out there? anything exciting happen lately?       I understand that he wanted to wait for a relationship possibility, but is that a reason to completely ignore me? Should I just dismiss the fact that he hasn't replied because in all reality, he's in the middle of a war or should I see it as a hint that he's not interested anymore?       I don't know.. I'm waiting for him and I already have been for over a year, I'm so afraid that if he comes home to visit and he really isn't interested I'll be crushed. Opinions would be wonderful.

20090205184559AA2okWd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl want to be more than friends?	Ok so, I met this girl about a year ago while I was in 7th grade and she was in 8th. I talked to her on the bus and around the school but that was about it because we didn't have any class together. Over the summer I asked her out and she said no. Now I got rid of my glasses, got a better hairstyle, and dress a lot better. Now she's 15 and I'm 14. Occasionally we see a movie together and 2 Sundays ago, she asked me if I wanted to see one and I said yes. She changed her mind and said if I wanted to come to her house and hang out and watch a movie and I said yes. While we were watching the movie, we sat on a couch and over time just got closer and closer until her head was on my shoulders and my elbow was touching her breast and she didn't do anything about it. So after I had dinner with her parents and hung out for a little bit more I left. After that, she invited me to go to some gymnastics thing at UF last Friday. Now, she just invited me to her house on Sunday to watch a movie. We text almost everyday, even during school.
20090205185046AA5gL6h	Family & Relationships;Family	Why do i feel like this?	Ok. Im so uncomfortable with my dad. He did so many things to me that screwed up my life. But since everyone forgave him, he's around more often. I hate it when he's at my house. My body tenses up so much, my heart pounds, I cant stand looking at him. I told my mom but all she does is getting me to talk to him more and be around him. I hate it!!! I want to cry so bad!! I dislike him. I forgive him for what he does, but when i'm around him, i'm just afraid. He...thinks he knows everything!! UGH!!! So whats your opinion on this? Should he even be around? Why am I getting pushed to like him?
20090205185207AAPGuQK	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I'm so hurt and I just don't know how to handle this situation....A little advice please!!!?	Two weeks ago my college sweetheart and also the man who broke my heart, contacted me and told me how he screwed up six years ago and how he wants me back. He pored his heart out to me and I believed him and all the feelings I had for him surfaced back onto my heart. We made plans to meet up in Vegas. Next thing you know his fiance contacted me and told me they were getting married and how they had twin girls. He didn't show up  and now once again he left me heartbroken. I'm so hurt and in distraught. I loved this man so much and I never stopped loving him. I also had a child but could never get this man off my mind. How can I get this man out of my mind even though we live miles apart and havent seen each other for six years?

20090205190700AAf3WHL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to deal with my negative husband?	Well, me and my husband are the complete opposites, he is pessimistic as they come and I am the optimist. He dampens the mood of anyone around him and can't open his mouth without something mean and nasty coming out of it. I am miserable when he is around and would much rather see him gone for the whole day then to have to listen to him. I can't even speak to him about my ideas or opinions on anything, he just goes right ahead and tries to shoot me down, but, i have never let him get to me enough to break my spirit. But, is there a way to tell him that his negativity and his personality as a whole make him an "ugly" person? I mean other people dont even want to be around him and we don't go anywhere together because he embarasses me. I'm starting to believe that no one will ever be able to make him see how he appears to others, he's 38 years old and is pretty much set in his ways. I am 31 years old and am really thinking of whether or not I want to continue to be married to a man like this. I think I have pretty much answered my own question, but would like to hear the opinions of others. Thanks for your time.

For the past few months, me and this guy have been "getting to know each other".  I met him once because he seems to be really far away and always busy with work.  He seems to be really interested in me but I feel like this is going no where.  I mostly talk on IM with him and today he just signed out without saying goodnight.  I don't want to do it after Valentines day because if he dosen't invite me anywhere, he'll think im doing it because he didn't do anything for me that day.  I kinda like him so I really don't want to do this but I don't think anything will come of it.        SHould I do it now or after Valentines day??   PLEASE HELP!!! Thank you
20090205190522AAMZF9q	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should i tell me friend this this i heard about her bf?	I have a friend and she just got her first boyfriend. They are super cute together, BUT i heard something. Her bf's step sister told one of her friends that the only reason he asked her out is because he was jealous that his sister had a boyfriend, and he wanted someone to be with but he doesn't really like her. he calls her all the time and always wants to hang out, it bugs her sometimes, but i know she really likes him, i just don't want her to get hurt. Is it mean if i tell her this, or should i? but one thing, we are good friends, just not best friends, so im not sure if i would be the right person to tell her, i kind of think she should know, but i dont really want to be the one to hurt her feelings by telling her. should i just leave it alone?

20090205191252AAiMIkB	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Inviting family only to the ceremony?	I am having a beach wedding which is what we wanted from the beginning so we aren't changing it. The only thing is that we only have room for roughly 40 people at the ceremony due to the area we are having it on the beach. We were thinking about having family only at the ceremony and having everyone at the reception since there is plenty of room at the hall we are having it at. There is no way to change location because this place is the most we could afford for the ceremony with our budget and we are not changing our minds on the beach. I just didn't know if peoples feeling will be hurt or not if They can't go to both. The only friends that will be there are the ones in the wedding. Help please?!

20090205185609AAzPqIW	Family & Relationships;Friends	My best friend isn't talking to me because of what happened at a party. Please help me?	If you're not going to read through this and help me please just leave, I'm not trying to be rude, I just need some good advice.      My best friend catholic and she believes in everything her family does.   (Her family is very religious.)      I'm a pretty carefree person and do whatever I want basically, don't take it in the wrong context though, I'm far from bratty.   Well we've been really good friends since about 7th grade, I'm a junior in high school now. I could tell her anything when we were friends, ANYTHING. She is such a special person in my life and I would hate to lose her. This dilemma started when we started hanging out with this group of girls, I knew them, she didn't but she got along really well with them. We went to one of their houses when their dad was gone and her dad has this fridge full of beer and my best friend was like "we should have one" and I was pretty surprised because I never thought she would want to do that, but she ended not having it. When we got back to her house she was actually disappointed she didn't have one.      So when we went to a party-like atmosphere the next week I asked her if she wanted to leave because I knew she would start feeling uncomfortable and also one of my friends wanted to leave too so I asked her if she wanted to go with her and she said no, to my disbelief, so my other friend went home. There was also hard liquor. I started to drink and I knew she was feeling uncomfortable but she didn't want to go home when I asked her which confused me so much. The next thing I knew she said "I'm going outside." I said "okay" thinking she was really just going to sit outside. About two minutes later I went outside to go see her, I was a bit drunk, and I see her walking really fast down the street and also someone outside said she was crying and talking on the phone. So I go grab my phone and start running after her and she's so pissed off. I try to talk to her and she's crying saying "get the f*** away from me." I was asking her what's wrong? what's wrong?? She didn't talk to me at all and she ends walking all the way home which is about 2 miles away. The designated driver drives up to her and we're calling out to her "just get in the car, we'll take you home" but she doesn't budge. Also take in mind this is around midnight and it's freezing out around 20 degrees. So we just follow her home much to her dismay because we wanted her to get home safely.      She contradicted herself basically because when she wanted a beer she could've had one at that girls house and she gets pissed off at me when I start drinking. I don't get it all and she still not talking to me, and she also didn't want to go home when I asked her. I don't understand it at all.      I haven't talked to her since, I miss her a lot but also the situation she made herself I don't understand.   Hopefully you got through all that and if you didn't I'll be happy to make clearer if you ask.   Please help me.

20090205185847AArHhMI	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you deal with someone who KNOWS they are right, even though you're certain they might be wrong?	hi there,      i'm trying to figure out how to deal with someone who is close, but is constantly trying to back up their opinions with false facts.  i notice this complex affects a lot of people, who desire so strongly to be right, that they are willing to pull make-believe evidence out of the air to back up their opinions whenever someone questions any aspect of their idea.      i find it silly, illogical, unproductive, and annoying when i'm unable to debate, or even discuss something with someone, because they are so set on their belief.  especially when its someone close to you.      how do you deal with this when someone is constantly doing it?  would you just keep letting it slide, or would you confront them on this, even though it could result in an ugly defensive situation?      any thoughts on the matter are much appreciated~   ~thank you
