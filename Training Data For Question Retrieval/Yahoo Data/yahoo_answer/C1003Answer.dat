Also, Shaq was a presence for Miami and grabbed a double double. Granted it was not Shaq's normal stat line that year, but it was effective. Again, look at Shaq this year shooting the best FT% at the line for his career, having monstrous games, and nodding in another All-star appearance yes that is the work of a hasbin {sracrasm}.|`|m501HwyWaa	TALKIN **** ON HERE WILL GET U NO WHERE ON HERE...HONESTLY WOULD HAVE THE BALLS TO BASH KOBE IN A TRUE LAKERS FANS FACE

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	I don't really know why most people can't "sell" something without making derogatory comments about the competition.  A lot of the blame for this goes to the advertising industry and our politicians, who do the same thing.  Even our highest-level politicians do this.  The Presidential Campaigns -- all of the candidates spend a considerable amount of money on "smear" campaigns.  Instead of extolling their own merits and virtues, they waste our time (and money) by telling us how bad the other candidates are.  Advertisers do the same thing: "our product is better than that crap so-and-so is trying to sell".<br>  <br>  Being fair to the TNA fans, "WWE fans" are worse.  Case in point: the "answer" above mine, which simply states "tna sucks".  For the most part, when TNA fans write something negative about the WWE, they do give their reasons for those opinions.  "WWE fans" generally just write "tna sucks" with no explanation for that opinion.<br>  <br>  Far too many fans seem to feel this is a contest, or that they are limited to just one company.  TNA and the WWE are different companies, neither is "better" than the other; both present pro wrestling differently from the other.  The best part, though, is we can watch either or both.  OUR choice.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	I agree with unnamed, oj, and the dragon.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	because wwe is better than tna|`|1WgOj89kaa	Because they cannot accept that WWE sells out shows week after week and has the best storylines and superstars.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Once again the Dragon is right on target. We live in a society that promotes an attitude of "If you can't beat'em then smear'em." It's so embedded in everything, example, you can't go to the sports section with out seeing someone smearing someones name, even though they have no idea who that person really is. They just happen to like someone else so instead of promoting the one they do like, they just smear the other choices.|`|b1bb1949f6bd80a6b260437ca822b177aa	rant.|`|bPAovOU5aa	Fact is...TNA is better than WWE but both are good!|`|2YFfwdxWaa	Protip: Wrestling is gay and fake|`|HFemIoh6aa	tna is not evnen that popular! oh and 2 that philp guy **** you!!! wrestling rocks!|`|Ip6Kg0PKaa	Newer fans are usually turned off by TNA simply because they've been brainwashed by Vince to think that anything that isn't the WWE is of lower quality (which is completely untrue). Others simply jump the bandwagon and base their preferences simply on what people are saying about TNA over the internet.<br>  <br>  EDIT: This isn't an answer, it is a statement.|`|V4LECaohaa	TNA SUCKS|`|lzbxT6p9aa	If anyone asks me why I like TNA, I never EVER compare it to any other company.

He won 6th Man Award cause of the fact AI carried the Sixers to the Atlantic division lead. Look, at other bench players that year , like Ron Artest, Brian Grant, etc. that season McKie won and they all had better numbers and were better players. Posey is a very good player from 3 and a great defender and a big reason why Miami and Boston have rings also a big reason why the Grizzlies made 3 straight playoff appearances after sucking it up before him and Gasol.

4DcvpQXfaa	That's ain't fair!<br>  <br>  Kobe had huge benefit because he can shot and 3 point!<br>  <br>  But Dwight and Shaq have their own benefit too<br>  <br>  They can post up Kobe and then make easy lay up|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Not if they decide to muscle him in. Shaq stands a better chance than DH12 cause he has deceptively fast footwork. Dwight is athletic as hell and strong like an ox, but he has no offensive game out of the paint. Shaq has the 5-10 footer one hand palm shot  thing going for him. DH12 also does not have quick footwork or an array of post moves, so KB24 can steal it from him easier than Shaq. But, if they decide to establish their physical might KB24 is done for. I play basketball everyday and I do not consider it a game to see who is better. I consider it a game to get better. Reason, being that I do not see a 1 on 1 in a game to see who is better cause a 1 on 1 favors mismatches and certain players have mismatches against another. That is why in the NBA game there is help defense. It is a team game that shows which player is better by leading their team against the other. Pippen and Jordan according to Phil played one on one numerous times and Pippen won a lot of those games. That does not mean Pippen was better.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	I'll crush Kobe so I know they could!|`|oMSTg5rQaa	A lot of guards couldn't beat centers one on one.

P93I8CHtaa	prime a.i|`|21J0IIZbaa	A.I. in his prime was one of the greatest scorers in history.|`|AA11488609	Wade.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	I would rather have a prime AI of course. Even, an AI now on a different team that does not use half-court sets and advocates a full-court system. AI would still be better than Wade today. AI thrives in that system and if you look at Pistons games closely you can see AI is the same: he is as fast and skilled as he ever was just out of place and out of his element in Detroit.<br>  <br>  I mean you look at him and see his is passing up shots because he feels uncomfortable. But, his crossover is as deadly as ever and his overall game is better now from playing in Denver and in some aspects in Detroit. Cause, his FG% is a whole lot better than his prime days and he is a better passer having 6-7+ APG. Like, I said you put AI in a transition game he will be the AI he always was and still is and prove he is still and forever will be better than Wade. Wade was held on a stretcher crying and grimacing in pain. AI played through a shattered rib and fractured finger for much of his career and throughout the playoffs well into the NBA Finals. This is 1 of many things that separate AI from Wade. AI > Wade.|`|Belb1stLaa	A.I.-In his prime|`|NzkPEKYgaa	D-Wade|`|7dd92fa9e1fedaa65abe9b3824b3fba3aa	Allen Iverson. He is one of the most talented guards ever to enter the league. Dwayne Wade is good but even now he doesn't have three-point range or the dribbling and passing skills of Iverson. In his prime, i seem to remember Iverson crossing Michael Jordan twice in two seconds. Wade would never have been able to do that. Sure he is stronger but he is also not as quick and Iverson's size has never impacted his ability to get to and finish at the rim. The fact that Iverson does not have a ring means nothing because if you can name another all-star caliber player that he had playing with him in Philadelphia, then you are lying (Chris Webber on broken down knees?, Keith Van Horn?, Derrick Coleman?, Aaron Mckie?, Eric Snow?) The best teamate Iverson ever had as a 76er was a younger Dikembe Mutombo who only played 26 games the year Iverson lost to the Lakers in the NBA Finals. Wade had Shaquille O'Neal, and an entire roster of solid supporting players when he won the NBA Championship. Iverson always did more for the 76ers than anyone did for their team. If he had ever played with a solid big man, he would have a couple of NBA championships. I really hopes he finds a good home for next season because he is being misused in Detroit.|`|dDhTMacAaa	Oh, wow this is close.<br>  <br>  A prime Allen Iverson is a legendary player. He could score from all over the court and was super quick and agile.<br>  <br>  However, Wade has improved his jumper and is a tenacious scorer. Plus, he works very well with other players for a guy of his status.<br>  <br>  Wade by a smidge.|`|YhfMrppSaa	D.

He started all ten playoff games and averaged 44.4 minutes per game despite being hampered by a number of nagging injuries. Iverson led the Sixers to an upset over the Orlando Magic, before losing to the Indiana Pacers in the second round.<br>  <br>  Prior to the next season, Iverson signed a six-year, $70 million contract extension.[7] That year, Iverson averaged 28.4 points and again led the 76ers into the playoffs. In the process, Iverson was selected to the Eastern Conference All Star team for the first time of what would be 9 straight appearances. In the playoffs, Iverson averaged 26.2 points, 4.8 assists, 4 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game, with a high of 40 points in the first round opener at Charlotte on April 22, 2000. Philadelphia advanced past Charlotte, but was eliminated again by Indiana in the second round. That season, he was the only player other than Shaquille O'Neal to receive a NBA Most Valuable Player vote, and he was named to his first All NBA first team.<br>  <br>  His contribution is very consistent than The Flash. So Iverson is a major factor in a team with very high efficiency in his prime time<br>  <br>  =].|`|ed937ded1f7d65f1c6eb94572e6afdd8aa	I'll take any version of Wade over Iverson. No disrespect to Iverson. He's a great player with great skills. But he's never been the caliber of player to lift his team to greatness. His one shot was against a pretty good Laker team in 2001. <br>  <br>  I think he would have stood a chance with a dominant point guard at his side. Maybe.|`|1070916be865ee45ad7eb6aaebfaa743aa	Wade currently. I've always maintained that AI is not a championship caliber player. In his prime he's taking 25 shots a game and not converting at an elite percentage. Wade may need pieces around him to succeed as well, but he shoots better and seems more well rounded.|`|DDQ8tCnpaa	A.I. cuz Wade is great, but we wouldnt want him to nearly kill himself playin pick up games hahahahahahaha|`|UOqWNXeHaa	Dwayne Wade he is a proven winner didn't matter who scores more it matters who wins|`|1S2gUdN0aa	Wade|`|5FypDafWaa	D-Wade|`|62MyU5D8aa	ai in his prime|`|vG0Ni0qDaa	ai.

His defense against Kobe Bryant was amazing. He gets steal, blocks, rebounds, and is an all-around player. He gives every team a great boost off the bench at both ends. The Hornets problem this year is their health and depth in the post i.e. Shawn Marks and Melvin Ely playing real minutes.|`|UOqWNXeHaa	Should  have stayed with boston celtics atleast he would win a second ring.

Stephon Marbury is not a good basketball player. he possesses good skills that could help in a one-on-one game, but actual basketball is a team sport. fitting a chemistry and being able to play with guys is part of being a good basketball player. Im not saying AI is as bad in this regard as Stephon, but AI is not a great basketball player. he is a guy that had skills in putting a ball in a hoop that just so happened to take place during basketball games. he does not know how to sacrifice his own agenda nearly enough to be part of a successful team.|`|BGY1TX64aa	Uhhhh, ever hear of a little team in California called, oh, darn, what's their name...oh, that's right, THE LAKERS!!!

Completely, throw away the 28 games left and the season officially ends tonight. I understand the Pistons are struggling and it has to do w/ AI not being right for the system. He is not a transition player. But, is still better than Wade if he was in a full-court style he would be the same AI. He is still as quick and as skilled as ever. But, like I said before does not fit this style and it shows he passes up shots something AI never did before.<br>  <br>  However, what do the struggles of Pistons and the fact that they are neck and neck w. Miami and beat Miami this year say about Wade. And do not give me Wade has nobody cause Shawn Marion and now Jermaine O'Neal are still capable players.

You also get to focus on differnet players who arent from your club which is always good.
JD5NQxeNaa	Chris Wilcox is also athletic and Hughes and him both are pretty good scorers. Wilcox can be a double double guy, like Haslem and start for us @ Center. Being, that Jeffries is beyond bad. Hughes gives us a chucker that is also a good defender and can play PG, unlike Nate, so he can give Duhon a well deserved rest and Nate is SG. He is also a true SG and we do not need to resort to making Q our starting SG.<br>  <br>  True they looking to sign Jannero Pargo or someone a team drops or Bonzi Wells or Ewing Jr. I heard. Plus, it was like we had 12 players before being that James, Rose, and Roberson sucked and never played.|`|FEViNlQMaa	Yeah so far it's Hughes and Wilcox, no big trades yet. The Knicks really need rebound since they are now a three point shooting team and Hughes will provide not only steals but also long range shots|`|vzH7f7V5aa	I agree with You. The Knicks are going to do better now.|`|P93I8CHtaa	knicks trade|`|vFbzBo4eaa	I agree with you,that was a good trade|`|0h52QcPbaa	New york Knicks has the best part of the trade deadline coz they have made their unused players to good used by dumping them to other team who barely needed them and they also have 3 roster spot which they can use to sign players for them to reach the palyoffs they are close but i guess not this year... closely followed by the magic and magic who needs a PG desperately even willing to give anything for them to land a good PG with rafer. rockets who have their new PG on their team they really needed a change on their PG eventhough i like rafer for the rockets but it would definitely get the rockets going with the young lowry. as per j_will status i guess miami can pick him up with dwade and moon skying above the rim looks great right? or the rockets might even get him for them to re-energize their bldg as per adelman's kings in the 2000.|`|urqGJPwpaa	I like what the Knicks did too.  I think they got some good players to help them, but they also didn't trade Marbury!  Hopefully they don't release him either because if they do, it's bad news for the Lakers and the Eastern Conference.|`|D6Llh23Baa	the orlando-houston trade, no doubt. orlando, finally, gets a decent point guard after losing nelson to injury. and houston gets lowry, arguably the best point guard memphis had this season.|`|7dd92fa9e1fedaa65abe9b3824b3fba3aa	yes definitely best value trade. but the most important trade was orlando getting Alston because they really needed a point guard.|`|m501HwyWaa	I AGREE AND I ALSO LIKE THE 2 PLAYERS THE LAKERS GOT|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Agree with you.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Getting rid of mihm<br>  <br>  <br>  and NYK signing hughes and wilcox|`|uAibwdMHaa	Magic got the best move with Skip to My Lou being added.........|`|AOLo6OG1aa	yeah the magic trade had the biggest immediate impact. but i think the knicks got Hughes because he used to play with Lebron! and they can be reunited on the knicks. I know crazy, but i think thats why they did it. pretty smart if u think about it.|`|62MyU5D8aa	magic-rockets-grizzlies trade that involves rafer,kyle lowry n brian cook|`|zbXvnuG2aa	Magic trade|`|UOqWNXeHaa	i agree im a boston celtics fan but it was a good trade for the knicks|`|FlOTIfhbaa	Bulls-Kings trade...good move by both of them.|`|cBzq5cy3aa	I like Bulls-Kings trade<br>  <br>  Fair|`|zOyLNxx9aa	I like Lakers move<br>  <br>  get rid of Mihm|`|21J0IIZbaa	The Bulls made the best moves to help their team.<br>  Lakers helped themselves by trading Mihm.
fLpnC8qtaa	I don't like either team, but dislike Victory and particularly Muscat more. So if i have to choose, I'll go for Adelaide !|`|hWpo4e8Maa	Australian football is Aussie Rules soccer is pommy<br>  Melbourne V's Adelaide who will win? who cares|`|ZlFZtTlmaa	i agree with Paul B, i dont really care, i'm not gonna cry about it.<br>  <br>  but i am supporting adelaide, and thats coming from a victorian.
yz6G7jfXaa	in F1, well that's difficult, because there are 2 eras to look at.<br>  one, which was the era before 90's where every corner you took, was a threat to one's life. and the people who races that time weren't highly paid, if you consider the fact that they risked their life doing the job.<br>  now a days, it isn't the case anymore. you can be 90% sure to walk out of a high speed crash. but that doesn't make the drivers any less brave.<br>  i feel the Fangio and Schumacher share the glory in F1.<br>  <br>  in moto GP, it has to be 'THE DOCTOR' Valentino Rossi.<br>  <br>  in WRC, it's undeniably, unarguably the great Sebastian Loeb, the sport hasn't seen anyone more successful.<br>  <br>  overall, it think it's got to be Loeb. he's simply spectacular! he's unbeatable, and fast a hell!<br>  it was once said; Citroen, Michelin, Loeb is a devastating combination!|`|KTxxd700aa	My opinion.<br>  Greatest F1 driver would be Jim Clark, led nearly 70% of all his races ,maybe more.<br>  Greatest Moto GP rider would be Rossi, though Mick Douhan is close<br>  Greatest WRC driver would be Juha Kankunen for making an effortless switch from group B.<br>  Id hate to pick one as greatest of all time.|`|FPJSoxYwaa	Schumi and Rossi are on the top of my list.|`|IuwVj2kGaa	Schumacher was great, but he did not had many rivals able to defeat him, because of lack of talent, or inferior machinery. He was also helped many times by the FIA.<br>  <br>  Senna had to compete against many other drivers with champion potential , like Prost, Mansell,  Piquet and Lauda and the supremacy of the teams was constantly shifting.<br>  <br>  Valentino Rossi vs. Giacomo Agostini.  Agostini won 8 championships in the 500 cc and many others in the 350cc, but Valentino has done it in a more difficult time with higher global competition and riding different bikes so i′ll go with′<br>  <br>  1 Ayrton Senna<br>  2 Valentino Rossi<br>  3 Sebastian Loeb
9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	..... if he would race to his ability and not his name he would be a champion.But it seems the past couple of years he has let his ego and name take over.<br>   Great equipment and a good crew but over does it and runs mid pack.|`|n55igpCUaa	Yes. He can drive... just not good enough to justify the amount of fans he has...<br>  <br>  <-- Bolt is sad because Dale Jr is a 15th place driver in winning equipment =(|`|ajnGHNr8aa	The pressure for him to win has to be enormous. He knows that he is not the best there is and no one will ever be his father, not even him. The media puts him on a pedestal of because of who his father was. If you remember how bad Kerry Earnhardt was, Jr. is like Richard Petty. Jr. is driving as hard as he can most of the time. He is not going to win 7 championships but he may win 1 or 2. I wish they would just leave him alone and let him drive. If the pressure was off of him a little I think he would drive better. <br>  Yes, he needs a better crew chief. One that can make the proper adjustments to the vehicle and can keep Jr. calmed during the race when things are going bad.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	If you saw his interview with DW then I think you would have a better perspective on the whole situation. He basically said that it is not his fault that his popularity does not match up with his success and he is absolutely right. It is not his fault that his father was Dale Earnhardt, one of the best drivers EVER in the sport. The sooner people stop trying to make him that the sooner they will realize that he is a GOOD driver doing what he likes to do.<br>  <br>  P.S. We're two races into the season................................wo...|`|EHtFxGxMaa	First, everyone has to forget who his father was.<br>  <br>  Second, everyone has to forget who his father was.<br>  <br>  Third, .......<br>  <br>  Look back at the statistics on Dale Sr. a lot of people forget that it took Sr. almost 4 years to get his first win.<br>  <br>  Jr. will come into his OWN rhythm and kick **** eventually.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	Nope. He's to auto racing as Paris Hilton is to celebrity stardom|`|AA10243163	I think Jr needs to get up on the wheel as they say but come on! My dad passed away last year and I cant imagine what he has to go through everyday! Everything he does is compared to his dad. Everything. Its amazing he hasn't drowned himself in budweiser! I hope all the best for him, but I hope he finds happiness first and winning second and if they go hand in hand well thats fine by me. He is still one of the better drivers in NASCAR the stats do show that as well, its not like he is hovering in the 30's in points.|`|HhCL30uUaa	I am a fan, obviously by my screen name but I was a fan of his dad as well.  It seems to me that Dale Jr. gets publicity no matter what he does.  I remember when he was getting all the publicity for acting bad, then he was getting all the publicity for doing nothing, then for the thing with DEI and his stepmother.  But if you will notice in all the new fangled Nascar ads, Tony Stewart, Kasey Kahne, even Mark Martin have a certain air about them in the commercials but when it comes to Dale Jr. he looks almost as if he wants to shout "hurry up and get that camera on someone else".  I don't believe he likes being the center of attention, he just wants to race, it's his legacy to do so and the publicity just happens to come along.  I don't, by any means, think he is overated...now Kurt and Kyle Busch are another story as well as Jeff Gordon, whom I lovingly refer to as "Rainbow Bright"! LOL!|`|7Qo0hcH4aa	hey coltqueen, he's the 4th winningest driver in NASCAR since 2000, so if that's 'barely mediocre', what does that say about all the drivers below him? but yes, i DO think he needs to dump eury jr., when eury SR. was his crew chief he won 16 races in 6 years. since tony jr has been his crew chief, he's won 1 race. the #s don't lie.|`|IrGapExUaa	Yesssssssssssssssssssss Jr is over rated. I"m sick of people making up excuses for him too. Last week at Daytona he should have had a worse finish then he did because he should have been hold on pit road for 5 laps like Jason Leffler was in the Nation wide. and then yesterday Blow a  Motor and i already have heard people Jr gets the bad motors the used Motors STOP MAKING EX CUSSES for him.  i don't see him making the chances this season. He's 35th in points after 2 races and i just don't see him running good enough to get in the top 12.|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	Well sorry but I don't really like either of my choices...over hyped or over rated.  <br>  <br>  My take on him being over hyped/over rated is that everyone has a different perception of how his career should be going myself personally I think he's doing just fine and I don't think you should count him out in '09!|`|7bc597034795bea4dbbecfea92484579aa	Yes, he is over rated.  He's really not that great a driver; if you took away all his fans that he has just because of who he is there wouldn't be all that many left.  On his talents, wins and stats he is just barely a mediocre driver.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hey know it all - how many races has he won in the last 3 years???  Oh, that's right, I can count those on one hand....If he could stop blowing engines he'd be much better...lol!|`|AA11971891	Dale Jr. is so over rated it is sickening! He is only where he is today because of who his father was.<br>  <br>  If you saw the interview DW had with Jr. in the pre race show yesterday,<br>  Jr. implied himself that he can't live up to his father's legacy.|`|p8JfOlTzaa	I think he's overrated by the fans and gets a free pass sometimes, but I don't hate him, people like him.  he actually had some balls to fess up to what happenned at daytona|`|CQiyaOYSaa	I don't believe that it's his crew chief, or his equipment.  I am not a fan or a hater either.  I feel that Dale Jr. is living in a MONSTROUS shadow of his father, and that expectations created by the media, fans of Dale Sr., that have adopted Jr. as their driver, are a constant distraction.  If Dale Jr. had decided to do anything else with his life, you would never hear a thing about what he was up to.  He's just a regular guy trying to live life as a better than average race car driver.  The stats speak for themselves.  I feel that he is a real person, with a TON of integrity, and unfortunately a TON of expectations weighing him down with every move he makes.|`|5wcmsHA4aa	Yes to both. Without that famous last name he would have disappeared to the small town dirt tracks years ago.|`|aBVOHkRTaa	Proof is in the Pudding !<br>  Cant wait to see him Winless in 2009 !!!

DOVbF4Piaa	You can't ride one day a week and expect to gain much.  You need to cycle as often as you can 3-4 times a week. You need to ride for 30 min or longer to see any cardiovascular improvement.  You want to pedal at a high cadence 70-90 rpm's with a lite pressure on the pedals.  That will keep your legs from tiring quickly.  Don't worry about speed just go for distance.|`|TEX1iYQgaa	How much fitter you would become depends on how often and on how hard you ride.<br>  <br>  One day a week is not going to cut it. You need to ride at least 3 days a week for at least 40 minutes at a time ~ and you need to it with some intensity. Don't worry about distance ~ focus on the time instead.<br>  <br>  You can't just casually pedal and coast, stop and smell the roses, never break a sweat, and expect to see results in your fitness. At the same time, you shouldn't try to go all out the entire time you're on the bike either. Your heart rate should be kept between 130 and 160 beats per minute while you're riding. That should be about right for someone your age.|`|Uacta4VQaa	Well, I am no fitness expert, but I have always heard that EVERYONE should get 20 minutes of exercise at least three times a week.  So, if its not raining and not too cold out go for a bike ride.  Get something for your Mom at the store, go to the library, the pond, a girlfriends, anywhere!  Do that instead of 20 minutes in front of your Game System!!  A fit body leads to a fit mind.

South Africa and India dealt very decisively with the 2000 match-fixing scandal. SA banished Cronje from cricket forever, and suspended Gibbs for 6 months. India banished Azzharudin forever and Jadeja for 5 years. even Kapil Dev's name was dragged through the mud. How did australia handle the Mark Waugh-Shane Warne-Tim May match fixing scandal. Swept it under the carpet! Dude, don't diss us! If you had dealt with your cheats the way SA and India dealt with theirs then Warne for example would never have played long enough to break the world Test bowling record!|`|d9XXe2kLaa	Mate, with a name like Aussie please spell Australia correctly.<br>  <br>  Of course we will be back at number one, but not for a while. <br>  <br>  I think we have had a great run and now it is time to rebuild.<br>  <br>  Let the South Africans have their time - fingers crossed they don't start taking money for matches again!|`|IxQzS9SEaa	Yes they can.

nwZD5mzRaa	He was tired of the way he was being treated by the selectors/BCCI, so he decided to quit international cricket on his own terms. I really wish he would have continued for atleast two more years. He's a great cricketer and didn't deserve to be treated that way.|`|AA11088802	he took retirement|`|cWuumdy7aa	He was old and was bad in fielding and running between the wicket he quit the cricket with Grace. rahul dravid should have quit also as he is out of form for too long and soon VVS will have to follow.|`|uKLlkOPSaa	There will be a certain time for everything - One must utilize that certain time - Otherwise it will become like ganguly and azharuddin|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	Actually they have allowed Ganguly to play for about 15 years.That is itself an achievement.|`|0TT5q0cUaa	he decided it himself no one forced him.|`|IxQzS9SEaa	He chose to rest his body and give time to his family. No one has pressurized him to quit. But what I thought was he should have retired in ODI but should have continued Tests. He was getting better in tests.

wXxJUnLJaa	4 quarters, 8 minutes long for high school.<br>  <br>  If you take two steps before bouncing the ball once it's a travel.<br>  <br>  When you shoot the ball, it's called a jumpshot.<br>  <br>  When you get fouled while shooting you go to the free throw line<br>  <br>  Once you cross over the half court line, you can't go back.|`|DDQ8tCnpaa	Sigh......<br>  You have to bounce the basketball to move, and thats called dribbling. if u pick up the ball and hold it in ur hands after youve driblled, you cant dribble again. if you do its called a double dribble, and the ball is awarded to the other team. If you move without dribbling the ball, then its called a travel, and the other team is awarded the ball. Some referees will allow a "hop step", where the player can take one hop after picking up the ball. the only exception to a travel, is you can take 2 steps after you pick up the ball and when ur going to shoot a layup or dunk. a layup is a shot when u close to the goal, and all you have to do is lay the ball into the hoop. a dunk is when a player jumps high enough to get the ball over the rim, and they shove it through the hoop with thier hand. A jump shot is when u r not underneath the goal, and u have to push the ball at the goal with one hand while using the other hand to balance the bal while shooting. A 3 pointer is when you stand behind the 3 point line, and make a jump shot. if you shoot, and are hit in anyway by the person defending you, then its a foul, and you get free shots, where you stand at the free line and are allowed to take shots without anyone defending you. a technical is when a player or coach yells or acts unsporstmanlike at anytime, and the other team is awarded 2 free throws and possesion of the ball. a flagrant foul is when a player intentionally fouls a player on the other team with the intention of hurting them. the player flagrantly fouled (if hes not hurt) is given 2 free throws and possesion. A jumpball is when 2 players grab the ball and they both have possesion. the referees will then tell you whos ball it is. if you dribble past the halfcourt line, then you cant dribble back over it, or the other team is given the ball. a rebound is when a player shoots the ball and misses, and another player jumps and grabs the ball.<br>  <br>  Positions: the point guard is the player who dribbles the ball up the court on almost every play. he is usually out there to pass and shoot jump shots.<br>  <br>  the shooting guard is 1 of 2 main scoring options for a team. he mainly does all aorund scoring (driving to the basket, jumpshots),<br>  <br>  the small forward is the second most likely scoring option for a team and is usually a all around player who can pass, shoot, and rebound.<br>  <br>  the power forward is mainly a rebounder, and so is the center, but they are also great scoring options underneath the basket.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As long as this took to type, i hope i get best answer, and i hope this helps.

WUc9TbHCaa	I think the best way to do this is to go to your local running specialty store. You will probably find that there is a local running club that you can join to meet people. As far as online sites go, you may want to check out <a href="http://runnersworld.com" rel="nofollow">http://runnersworld.com</a><br>  There is a forum there and the ability to create a blog.<br>  <br>  Also - as far as logging activity, I find that a GPS device like the Garmin Forerunner 305 coupled with software such as SportTracks (<a href="http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTra...</a> is really great for logging runs. Try them out.<br>  <br>  I would definitely start with your local running store though - as someone who is just starting out, the most important thing you can do to become a serious runner is to get properly fitted for shoes. Going into your average shoe store and just buying whatever is a sure way to get sore feet and get put off from running. Everyone's feet are different and local running stores have people trained to assess your arch, gait, and body type to determine what you need.|`|wFw0SlJsaa	<a href="http://www.mapmyrun.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mapmyrun.com/</a> has distances and times but I'm not sure about the social part.  That would be sweet though.
dpSr0icwaa	SKSs are less money, so I'd rather have two SKSs for $600 than one AK for $600.<br>  <br>  Both are very reliable guns, SKSs are actually slightly more accurate.<br>  <br>  Of course, AKs have a detachable 30 round mag vs a fixed 10 rounder...<br>  <br>  but on the other hand, stripper clips allow the SKS to be loaded really quick, and you can get 20 stripper clips for less than it costs to get 1 AK magazine, that's 200 rounds ready to load in seconds|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	I have a Chinese SKS and AK. Both have been 100% reliable. Have had the SKS for over 20 yrs, the AK about 13. The SKS is a great little rifle to carry in the woods when walking my farm. It's good for coyotes (2 and 4 legged) and deer as well.|`|nBUDjyhgaa	SKS, hands-down.In 15 years, my Russian SKS has never failed,using all kinds of surplus ammo.Several years back, I got an old AK,and never got a full clip thru it without at least one jam.I eventually cut it up and scrapped the pieces.Personaly, I wouldn't touch another AK.I think they're junk|`|Ui2WJH4Iaa	which do you see more people using today?  don't you love a question for an answer?  really though, it comes down to stripper clips vs drum magazines.  you're gonna get posts about how much more accurate an sks is.  just roll your eyes and walk away.<br>  I love yahoo responses.  the guys saying an advantage to an sks is how fast you can reload it!?!  lol. and the guy that said AK's  are temperamental.  ask a soldier which rifle he'd rather carry.  there's a reason the AK 47 is the most ubiquitous rifle in the world|`|oYf3jSq6aa	SKSs are better built and more accurate<br>  AKs  have higher capacity magazines and are more forgiving of adverse conditions<br>  <br>  Which ever is more important to you|`|4AbXxowTaa	AK-47.  I fired a genuine automatic Russian piece in Iraq seized from insurgents, truly an awesome weapon.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	I prefer my SKS.  It seems to be a much better-built piece of equipment than any AK I have personally seen.|`|wORqCGlyaa	ak's are tough, ugly, and not very accurate, but generally extremely reliable<br>  sk's have a very annoying mag release system, shoot fair, are less pricey than ak.<br>  i still prefer ak|`|yOfYa6Nmaa	The best answer I can think of on this, is personal preference. Mine is SKS, with a dragonov mod, a little of the best of both worlds.

A team can have many players cause each player is specialized to do a certain thing, so if the coach needs you, you go in. Or some people on the team are just backups. So they sit on the bench incase others get hurt. My school has 60 for varsity, and Dont know about other teams

W2ibvX9taa	i bought it on ebay for 40 and i rate it a 10.<br>  <br>  The thing is it doesn't matter how good the game is it's Madden and they always stand on top.<br>  <br>  Some people will be like<br>  "madden should be sued over monopoly laws, because thats what they've done to the football sim. they've monopolized it, which means they don't even have to improve their game each year because they have no competition. its bull, at least when the 2k sports had football games out, it was some compettion, same with 989 sports and gameday. gameday was better, i always bought them over madden, but now i have no choice!"<br>  <br>  And it's kinda true.|`|AA10371712	Probably around 7-10 it's pretty good!!!|`|2lA8oaVXaa	9|`|Kda2Rt3raa	I would give it a 9 because the gameplay is noticeably more fluid than it has ever been.  Also, it's harder to pass because the defenses actually catch the INTs when they're in the correct position.  In 07 most of these were dropped.  The game is designed to reward smart players and punish poor decisions with turnovers.  This reduces the frustration a lot of people get while playing madden because the "you're so frickin lucky" factor is minimized.  I like the players weapons because they create mismatches with your opponent.  This is the first Madden game that has impressed me, it just seems like it's noticeably more realistic during gameplay.|`|nT6nED6Jaa	i rate it a 7<br>  i cant stand the cut scenes, and without al michaels and john madden it just doesnt feel the same playing it.<br>  its a big step up from 07 on the next gen consoles.<br>  besides the lame radio announcer|`|tKo7I8kTaa	8

Your choices are pretty good though!|`|AA12034105	I love Monte Carlo, Madrid and Indian Wells for the ATP :)<br>  I love any other one Rafa does well in too haha :P<br>  Tbh I don't watch much of the WTA tour apart from at the Grandslams :)|`|S5EMFQXfaa	in the means it indianapolis<br>  in womens it the season ending championship|`|AyQV6ZDiaa	Definetly the Cincinati Masters for both ATP and WTA!!|`|x5N1PO4haa	Madrid masters for men and Dubai for women!!|`|3NvSUXmqaa	I really like Rome and Monte Carlo along with Indian Wells and Miami|`|pYieTvDqaa	Well for both the ATP and the WTA, I absolutely love the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami, it's just a fantastic setting for a hard court tournament in Miami and you can pretty much count on all the top 10 players to be there. <br>   As for the ATP I have always enjoyed the masters series especially the Monte Carlo Masters. Monte Carlo is one of my favorite cities and one the most beautiful cities in the world and it's just fun to imagine playing a tournament in such a glamorous city where all the rich and famous and allot of players call home. <br>   For the WTA it's a tie between Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Zurich there all great tournaments in really nice cities. Of course me being from Moscow, that tournament is very special,LOL.<br>  <br>  But none of the regular tournaments can compare to the grandslams or the Olympics especially. I don't care where the Olympics are held it's always going to be one the grandest tournament stages for any player to grace and to be chosen to represent your country at the biggest sporting event in the world is a feeling I'm sure unlike any other. It really angers me when stupid announcers and nay-sayers groan about tennis not belonging at the Olympics, that is complete garbage to me. It's not like they have a problem getting all the best players on the teams so what's to complain about? Okay yeah maybe the playing schedule could be hectic, but it is the Olympics, it's not a grandslam tournament that occurs every year. It is the Olympics that only comes every four years, and it would be worth it whether you win or lose.|`|6S8KjBLQaa	Wonderful question, and as I've stated before I love Indian Wells. It is televised, fresh, and the weather is always nice! It really is a fresh of breath air to watch, and it really is when I start watching tennis on tv again, after the Aussie..<br>  (I like it more so for men)<br>  <br>  I like the Canada Masters for women, because it is televised as well, and it is a part of the US Series...not many top players play, which is part of why i like it..new faces we'll say!<br>  :P|`|u3FqxhY8aa	I love the  olympics because you are representing your country and stuff and it is almost like a fifth slam each year, but it is almost more special to win because it only comes around once every four years.  I also like the Legg Mason tournament in Washington D.C. because I can visit there even though Novak doesn't usually come to it.....I do also love the year end championships because we get to see plenty of top quality matches between the best players of the year for both the men and women.  I also love all of the hard court tournaments in the US right before the clay season is about to start.<br>  Thank you for adding some interesting variety into the questions on the tennis section.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Definitely Madrid, because it's my favorite city in the world and when I was there last year it was awesome. There was none of the formality I would expect in a tennis tournament, you know, it was just incredible. I'm sure it will stay that way this year when it's transferred to May and changes venue and surface this year.<br>  <br>  As for the WTA, well, I never had a fave tournament as I was never really into it, but since starting this year the Madrid MS will be a joint event, then it works here too! :-)|`|75ZMWlnnaa	to be honest with u, i like any tournament which has 4 or more of the following ATP players competing:<br>  <br>  - rafa, federer, blake, djoker, roddick, tsonga, gasquet, safin<br>  <br>  for WTA, as long as there are 4 of the following WTA players competing:<br>  <br>  - dementieva, ivanovic, dokic, sharapova, li na, jie zheng, safina, venus|`|Y31Ci8vlaa	As an INDIAN I like Chennai open.|`|AA11218682	with the non slam tournys i just follow the ones with the prettiest court
oM75eeyQaa	Because he was absolutely rubbish. He scored against Arsenal (good) and against West Brom (bottom of the league) and that was it. He managed to score in two games in the PL!! He missed absolute sitters every week. Just not good enough for a ￡20m player.|`|GZ4ix77Saa	He got rid of Keane because he wasn't settling. As a Liverpool fan, I believe that Benitez should have at least kept him until summer. Keane usually shines in the second half of the season, and he might have helped us during this part of the season.|`|0t8XYZKRaa	Liverpool paid 20m for him to perform and score but he didn't. Besides Kuyt will handle the job when Torres get's injured.|`|A0G6Ye8Qaa	I see why he did it, Keane was not scoring goals and hadn't really settled in. I don't like that he didn't bring anyone else in to replace him though. If Torres gets injured they're pretty much stuck.|`|FKP9rHIHaa	Well Kuyt is reliable but your right they have no other relpacments if torres gets injured i think it was a stupid decision and El Zhar isnt the best at the moment.
OYYYNCyCaa	Phil Thompson by a NOSE was the worst ever manager|`|eCGg94HJaa	Oh the shadow from the nose is frightenin'<br>  It stops the light outside from shinin' in<br>  You can see it wherever he goes<br>  Thompson's nose, Thompson's nose, Thompson's nose|`|1WgOj89kaa	Souness.|`|D7Dubtt9aa	Phil Thompson was only a stand in manager for houllier and he did a ok job|`|gPvOcB6oaa	Graham Souness..Has managed eight clubs and never won anything|`|EYElOumLaa	When Thommo was forced to take over from Houllier Liverpool had a better record that season under Thommo than Houllier, he actually done quite well. He is just a character that you love to hate, maybe next time you will do some research into your question before posting it.<br>  Although Houllier won a lot of trophy's for the time he was there, he still changed Liverpool for the worse. Their style of football became very poor to watch (at least Roy Evans tried to keep in with the Liverpool traditions of 'playing' football). Houllier brought in Jari Litmanen from Ajax, probably the most gifted/controlled footballer of that time, and yet like Benitez with Keane would only give him 10-15 mins and the end of games. <br>  But to answer your question the worst that I can recall was Graeme Souness who tried to turn Liverpool into a group of hard men, and sacrificed the talent in return for this, who in their right mind could have ever thought that Julian ***** was a player of the quality that Liverpool needed.<br>  However, I need to correct a previous answer who said that Souness won nothing with the 8 clubs he managed he actually didn't do that bad:<br>  Rangers: 3 Leagues and 4 Scottish Cups<br>  Liverpool: 1 FA Cup, 1 Charity Shield Runner-up.<br>  Galatasary: 1 Turkish Cup & 1 Turkish Super Cup<br>  Benfica: 1 League Runner-up<br>  Blackburn: 1 League Cup & 1 First Division (Now the Championship)|`|7x4VtGtFaa	Rafa seems to be giving them stiff competition.|`|p8lB73rdaa	Thommo only looked after the team while Houllier was ill , he was never the manager .
7x4VtGtFaa	Possibly the last straw that will break the camels' backs. More appropriately, the two American's backs and a Scouser's ar.se.|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	Real Madrid are a Great team.<br>  I admire and respect them very much.<br>  In my opinion they are the best in Europe.<br>  But I don't see them beating Liverpool in both matches.<br>  Liverpool have been great in Europe, beat some big teams.<br>  Real Madrid is a bit of a tough one for Liverpool but I have faith in my team. <br>  I'm not deluded to think that way, just supporting my team cause I believe in them.|`|q1hjMFtgaa	I'm not quite sure how anybody can say they are the best team in Europe, i think they would at least be top of their own league if they were, haha. Some people hate United and can't stand to admit that they are the best team at current.|`|SG5vRFWjaa	agreed|`|OYYYNCyCaa	at least with the master tradesman  carragher he will try and hammer in a nail<br>  <br>  <br>  oops that would be an own goal <br>  <br>  they will drive in about 3 nails|`|AA11683996	Madrid are an excellent football team.<br>  Better that Manchester City (well that's not very hard now, is it?)<br>  <br>  I say they will hammer the reds into such a depression that they won't win another game until 2010.
iCvIQugXaa	It's Anna Bessonova. I remember watching her this summer.|`|cOkUsbleaa	Anna Bessonova I saw her before I could be wrong though!
qX4R4ruyaa	When this tie first was drawn I would have said liverpool as they were doing well and real madrid were doing poorly, real madrid had a lot of injury problems and defensive problems, but now their defense have got a lot better especially with diarra as their two midfielders can also play defensive and go forward.<br>  <br>  With liverpool endlessly drawing in the premier league, recent 1-1 with man city, and Real Madrid'sds hammering real betis 6-1, all in the first half, inspired goals. My money will be on real madrid, they have only conceded 2 goal in their last 9 games, scoring 24 and winning all 9, scoring 10 in the last two games. <br>  <br>  Liverpool seem to depend on Gerrard and Torres who strugglingeing with a lot on injuries this year. I also think real madrid has a lot more choice, liverpool lack subs, no attacking options or midfield, while read madrid have plenty of experianced world class players to choose from!<br>  <br>  My prediction is 1-0, 2-0, 3-1 real madrid! With best players being Robben purely for his pace, speed and position on the wing, i think it will cause liverpool defence some problems, raul or guti! For liverpool will be Gerrard he is world class. Although this match could go each way, i wont b suprised if gerrard bangs in a 25 yearder!|`|ccOJn7q8aa	L.I.V.E.R.P.O.O.L<br>  <br>  not a fan....just a brit<br>  <br>  <br>  come on you English footy fans support your teams!!!!!|`|XoOanmdraa	i really hate real madrid, so i hope they lose|`|1WgOj89kaa	This will be one of the best UCL Ties in a long time, COME ON LIVERPOOL, only we have the heart to pull it off.|`|0t8XYZKRaa	Liverpool 1-2 Real Madrid<br>  Raul nets 2 goals and Torres nets a goal for Liverpool. <br>  Man of the match=Raul Gonzalez|`|lR6TISEXaa	I think Liverpool. I played Madrid with Liverpool today on Fifa and beat them 3-1, so that's my pick.|`|Fex1ZVRoaa	it will be a close match but i think real madrid win|`|iO7TMOMNaa	if we get over our injury troubles, liverpool will cruise past madrid, their defense isn't strong enough for gerrard, torres and riera|`|iBYZjzcjaa	2-2<br>  both side have equal strength|`|oOenELjVaa	real madrid will win even though liverpool have a strong team
dhs9QBMoaa	Depends on what you want to spend.  The best seats are second level, though I disgree with one of the previous answers about the upper deck.  You can usually get seats in the section (524) right behind the plate if the visiting team isn't a big draw.  If you can manage to get something in the first 5-10 rows, the view is pretty good.|`|NpqAbZqpaa	Living in the Toronto area, I would suggest the best place to sit is your living room.  (horrible place for baseball), but if you have to go to the SkyDome, level 100's and 200's are the only decent seats.  <br>  <br>  In fact, they move people from the cheapies 500 levels down so it looks 'full' when they scan and they just avoid filming the top level.<br>  <br>  It is a very inexpensive place to watch baseball, compared to other cities.  Every concession with the exception of Tim Horton's is priced between 50 to 100% higher for the same product than on the outside.<br>  <br>  Tim Horton's (coffee, bagels, donuts) have the exact same pricing.|`|6440aca54e76133287a99d198c3d1a37aa	I would suggest the 100 level behind home plate or first or third base line.  There are approximately 40 rows in the 100 level, I would suggest sitting row 25 or higher because then you'll be shaded from the sun by the overhang of the 200 level.  <br>  <br>  If you look at the seating chart in the link below, I'm talking about the purple seats after the yellow ones.  <br>  <br>  Tickets for the Blue Jays are not that expensive compared to other cities.  In fact, when we play the Yankees, the city is flooded with New Yorkers because its cheaper to spend the weekend in Toronto and watch 2 games than it is to buy just the tickets to 2 games in New York.|`|9d5001a56ba031ba48358cae82b85660aa	I would say some thing like sections 115-118|`|2VYjOqnpaa	Second level. Get a good view looking above. I always find it easier to look down then to look ahead. You see the field better.
nmOIdnbKaa	You are cool.|`|2kVmQWF0aa	I think he's actually pretty smart.  You wouldn't believe it by the way he is in with the WWE.  I remember seeng him on family feud though.  He was the smartest person on his team, considering he had Booker T, Coach, Ric Flair on his team he was the smartest at giving the answers.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	actually i dont know what are you talking about|`|D9QLM6sRaa	Smart but not lucky.|`|eYs8DpbBaa	I have no idea how his intelligence is. He seems pretty articulate, so I will go with probably smart.|`|9CLRMnhSaa	Dumb, you know the WWE is keeping him cause he makes money for the company.<br>  <br>  It is dumb!|`|a0RgVoScaa	He's a gifted Genius.|`|KH9bbeCNaa	his on roids|`|b7JS16dyaa	How can we judge him so easily? Sure, he seems clumsy on the mic and in the ring on occasion, but you'd have to know the guy pretty well before saying whether or not he's intelligent. He also seems intelligent enough during shoot interviews, if slightly judgemental and arrogant.|`|5jIdcbyYaa	His mic skills aren't so great which makes him look dumb? But i don't find him dumb though. The dumbest wrestler I saw on live wwe/wcw wrestling was Sid aka Sycho Sid. He would always mess up during his interviews and segments.|`|52luRGoVaa	roids' eating his brain cells, though he doesn't seem that dumb, more like a bad actor, still better than cena though.|`|TUURiVnraa	lol wdf thats soo random|`|4eQqTiYwaa	i dunno go ask him ,<br>  <br>  and if hes dumb he will say i dont know|`|kDAmNqt0aa	He's on roids continuesly. cheat.|`|VlvektSJaa	He is a little clumbsy.<br>  <br>  What meat head isn't dumb?|`|CLLsDlViaa	yes, CAUSE THATS HOW I ROLL!

0BhcnLVbaa	I'm surprised that Cute Kip, BG James & "Sarah Palin" are still around at this point. They should have been axed.<br>  <br>  The roster cuts were to trim the roster. In light of the recession, some had to go, but I'm surprised at the retrenched list which spells talent.<br>  <br>  Sonjay would do wonders for the WWE's Indian fanbase. Given the way R-Truth has been decent since his return, I hope that WWE can push Sonjay as well.|`|tl1HTJRwaa	My opinion they need to fire; Steiner, Nash, Booker (only reason they are in TNA is cause they are close to Jarrett)<br>  &<br>  Not fire Petey or Sonjay<br>  I think they want to cut their budget that & the creative team has nothing for them.<br>  <br>  Yes; The WWE has interests in signing Sonjay (he'll be used wrong though)|`|5jIdcbyYaa	It's either they wanted more money since the economy is bad or they already had new talent coming to TNA.
AA10056762	You could. But you shouldn't. .12's are of terrible quality (only a select few makers make good .12's) and they are way to light for that gun. I suggest you look into KSC .3's those are pretty nice.|`|cOqvh2WAaa	.12g bb bullets as stated by the previous answers are too light, their finish is horrible, some bullets are not round and have a welding ring around it, also the bullets might break inside the gun cause jamming, this happened to me once. .12g are also less accurate than .30gs|`|1Rwby58Daa	no. its too light. you need metal seamless bbs for this. must be 2g-3g|`|Y4mz8BShaa	If you want to destroy the already poor quality hop-up, tear up the barrel, and all the while not hitting anting near where you aim.<br>  <br>  Airsoft Elite Black .28's or MadBull .30's for that monster.

While nothing can be proved categorically there is  a suspicion that he was targeting certain batsmen and teams. I am not in a position to say whether they were deliberate or just coincidence.<br>  At least now, he has made the 'right' decision, and let's wish him a happy retired life, somewhere near the tropical waters of the Caribbean.|`|bN6S0FJEaa	Well it looks like I am answering my own question, I asked similar question few hours ago.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bucknor has done good job as an Umpire in international cricket, I think he holds the record for being the Umpire in most WC Finals.<br>  He should have announce his retirement before 3 years.<br>  <br>  Good luck for him for the future.|`|tz7JEqstaa	He is a good man. I don't think that he intentionally made errors, should have retired a few years ago and saved his reputation.
FkFKDpt5aa	yes<br>  vidic is quality|`|pTFfpoqEaa	listen doesn't matter who plays, as long as u play for scum ur gud enuff so no excuses, look at van de sar when he was at fulham and juve he was shedding loads of goals in and he got replaced by buffon so does that mean its him who shuts them out? or as sad to say but it's more the team than van der sar and vidic.<br>  <br>  The only reason van der sar holds the world record now is because teams were scared to shoot and attack scum not cos van der sar was brilliant, he played a part but more the team helped him out more than owt else|`|qMYhZSZdaa	Nahhhhhhhhhh.<br>  no team can go on without conceding..<br>  hell its a GAME and things can go all ways..<br>  Agree that Vidic and Van Der Sar are top notch but even Man U must concede and sometimes the simplest of goals<br>  the success is down to a wonderful management (including directors etc.) that give the manager TIME....

He is looser.<br>  <br>  2) He has realized that his form is bad and when he plays in IPL he will embarrass himself infront of great Indian talent.<br>  <br>  3) He is also afraid of India pitches because he is only good on Australian pitches and is bad at all other pitches in the world.|`|60uWyEKtaa	Ricky places being in form for the Ashes, the most important Cricket match on the international calender as more important than two weeks of hit and giggle.<br>  <br>  As any good Captain should.<br>  <br>  I heard that the Indian management of KKR are sobbing their little hearts out.|`|De1tOxHXaa	you are right..<br>  i think these are the only possibilities that ponting don't wanna play for ipl this time....|`|V3GAZKivaa	i think you are right punter is a cheater and he is quite frustrated these days.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	None of those. It was suggested by coach & CA that because of his heavy schedule this year he should rest from cricket for a while. As IPL is not important this is his best opportunity to do so.

ZrMlG8djaa	One word Leverage. You've probably heard the phrase "the lowest man wins" right? Well this holds true to running ppl over (not to mention ALWAYS keep your legs moving). I played on some pretty good defenses ranked in the top 5 nationally in Div 1 so really hitting hard isn't as important as making the tackle, Bud. One technique for dishing out the pain though is wrap up and drive through the ball carrier (keep those feet moving). Remember a good running back/wr can bounce off big impacts and keep moving so don't EVER rely on making a big hit without wrapping up to secure the tackle. Football is all about POWER so focus your weight training around Powercleans, squats, and deadlifts. Good luck and I hope this helps!!!|`|wxXguyK3aa	How much do you weigh?|`|3IQq3FPSaa	I agree with P Dub, you've got to use leverage, wrap up, and drive through the ball carrier. I played safety and had a reputation as a vicious hitter. I did everything he said as far as using good form and technique, but I also used good angles. I always thought of how I wouldn't want to be hit and where on my body I wouldn't want to take a hit. That's where I would hit people. You've got to get stronger and develop your speed, especially your burst speed. Speed translates into power when using good technique. Also don't ever get caught standing on the tracks when the train is coming through, you've gotta attack the ball carrier, don't wait on him to come to you. That's easy way to get trucked. When you're trying to run someone over, get your pad level lower than theirs, and explode when you make contact. Good luck joe!|`|jLOCqhckaa	Get really low, I'm 5'4 in the 10th grade I've got no problem tackling the 6'0, 5'9, '510 guys. I just get really low.

Or it's maybe because I have no regard for human live and play foot ball to kill!!! :) Of course that's a joke.|`|qvuQSQvpaa	squats. hit power come from legs n shoulders. weight on yo bac muscle up the shoulders too. and more weight can help. but also mid range weight and gettin LOWER wen u do em|`|8Be0iMN5aa	use your shoulder pads and stay low if you see big hits all are from shoulder pads not hands.|`|PC60YeBIaa	so many 5'11" 8th graders on this site<br>  <br>  weight? weight? need your weight.

And I was once not able to do this. I think that the EASIEST  move you can do is the basic crossover driblbe. It is so easy and so affected by gettin pass defender.I learned by just dribbling the ball in front of my legs back and forth between my hands in a "slow but trying to shake someone manner".Trust me, just dribble the ball like you are trying to shake someone but do it slow(not to slow) and you will be AMAZE what you will do in a real game!!! <br>  Don't forget you need quickness NOT speed.<br>  MJ had quickness not speed!|`|D8a5Dqq3aa	get a basketball and some cones in the gym or a flat surface spread them out or have them space apart then dribbel the basketball throught them<br>  This allows you to switch both arms while dribbling,improve your speed and your drive<br>  i play basketballl so please ask me more questions about basketball|`|UOqWNXeHaa	Two basketballs   one in each hand<br>  then do 25 dribbles north south at ankles, then knees, then waist, then do same for east west, then try cross over , and switching ball from hand to hand.|`|7iIWxsAGaa	Practice everyday 1000 dribbles and 1000 cross overs|`|AOLo6OG1aa	well, i used to take the bus to school at your age, so what i did was have a basketball with me at all times. I dribbled to the bus stop and then to school. I did that every day for about 6 months and I noticed I had already got really good. but yeah thats how i learned. plus i kinda pushed myself. for example, im right handed, so for a while all i did was use my left hand. I didnt do anything fancy, all i did was try to develop a comfort with my left hand, that was the same as my right. i didnt even realize it but eventually i was using both hands at the same level.|`|ybk9VleOaa	try dribbling without seeing the ball..<br>  you may even try closing your eyes..<br>  practice harder and more your weaker hand..<br>  just keep practicing..and stay consistent.. ^^|`|DDQ8tCnpaa	dribble and play games on a sukish (or on dirt) court. that really helps.
KTxxd700aa	Not F1 but I remember a champ car race in 2007, where (NOT surprisingly) team Minardi USA ran out of new front wings when both Robert Doornbos used 2 and Dan Clarke used his 2, came into the pits (not yet mid distance) for his 3rd, only to be told to get out of the car!|`|d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	For a single driver the most I can remember off the top of my head is two, but I have a feeling that there was a "3" in the not-too-distant past.

RAZ34aYWaa	i would never recommend being vegetarian as a diet for a swimmer. my friend was vegetarian and it made her so ill with all the training that in the end she had to give up being vegetarian. A swimmer needs a diet with lots of carbohydrates like rice and pasta so that you constantly have a large supply of energy. Make sure that you have fat in your diet too because when your body runs out of using energy from carbohydrates it moves on to the energy in your fat stores. A swimmer also needs protein to repair the muscle and help it grow after strenuous training. A swimmer also needs fruit and vegetables to get vitamins and minerals to keep them healthy.<br>  Hope this helps|`|e6194ade1f407494b6f0be00450abb7caa	Certainly not vegetarian. A swimmer should eat a very balanced diet, lots of carbs, protein, and dont restrict fat all together. You need to just eat smart. Swimmers should eat just like any other person really, except they should stack up on carbs before workouts and eat some protein afterwards. Diets dont work, only excercise. Dont restrict anything unless it is full of fat.|`|yXay0Tdjaa	As a swimmer you really can eat anything without gaining weight but its important to eat enough fruits vegtables and protein. Also before a big meet or practice eating lots of carbs can give you extra energy... i'm a swimmer myself and our team usually does a spaghetti dinner before the big meets.

ybk9VleOaa	A basketball bounces because of the air and gravity. The air makes the ball bounce. When you bounce the ball the air does not want to stay up, it goes down. This is called Gravity. If you bounce the ball hard, it will go high. If you make a small bounce, it won’t really bounce at all. “A basketball is elastic. Elasticity is an objects property of changing shape when the deforming force is removed. When an elastic basketball hits a hard surface, it’s shape is deformed and kinetic energy is converted to and stored as potential energy. When the basketball returns to it’s original shape, potential energy is reconverted to kinetic energy making the bounce.” says Thang Nguyen from Science Net.|`|eTAiP7OPaa	A basketball bounces because of the air and gravity.

W4LGDVsIaa	I agree with the above answerer.  You can only get so far in swimming with strength and such.  To improve in swimming once you are conditioned and have stamina you have to focus on technique.  Working on the little things such as your kick, turns, and breathing is going to help you get more distance out of your strokes and use your energy most efficiently.  This is something that can be difficult to do on your own, since you can't see yourself swimming.  If you don't already have one, it would be beneficial to get a coach who can help you improve technique and give you drills that will help you progress.  Another great thing you can do is see is there is a Masters swim league in your area, you can join even just for a month and benefit from coaching and team practices as well.|`|AA12380746	Agree with everyone Else.<br>  <br>  a huge muscle building guy won't be that great in the pool... so much other stuff contributes to you being a good swimmer...<br>  <br>  Breathing how you breathe can ad or take away time<br>  <br>  how you put your hands in the water and pull<br>  <br>  if your flip turns are sloppy you will loose time<br>  <br>  so improve on the little things and I bet you will go further.|`|TzPofCDxaa	Swimming is more about technique.<br>  <br>  You can run distance further because the swimming practice has strengthened your muscles.
sywoTNKgaa	Yes. In addition to mentioning Peer in her victory speech, Venus (who is a member of the WTA players council) is heading to Indian Wells next month for a council meeting to decide what more should be done to right the wrong in the Dubai controversy.<br>  <br>  I disagree with what "CATMANDU" had to say because if Venus didn't care she could've stayed out of it completely. A lot of other players chose not to comment. <br>  <br>  People like "CATMANDU" don't understand that the professional tennis circuit is not like your neighborhood tennis tournament. People do care if you don't show up. The players can't just pull out at will because they feel like it. There are repercussions for their actions-there are fans and sponsors to worry about. <br>  <br>  Professional tennis is a business and the tours operate like businesses. Some tournaments are mandatory for top players, injuries are verified, and fines are handed out in an effort to keep the sponsors happy and the tours alive.<br>  <br>  A top player like Venus withdrawing from Dubai would be costly to the player, the tour, the fans, and the sponsors who sponsor more than just Dubai. It is important for the WTA which has had trouble landing sponsors to keep the sponsors (who not affiliated with the tournament) happy, that is why the event was not immediately canceled and the players did not withdraw.<br>  <br>  Peer found out last Saturday her visa was denied, the players were already in Dubai and the tournament was just about underway when it became known to everyone. The WTA players did not have the choice(like Andy Roddick) of wether or not to make the trip to Dubai because they were already there. Canceling the event or withdrawing players would be a catastrophic and costly blunder for the tour. <br>  <br>  Venus should not donate her prize money to worthy Isreali causes because she is NOT taking a political side. She is standing up for a fellow player who was denied a right to play, it doesn't matter where Shahar Peer is from.|`|StqBr5XRaa	we need more athlete's to be more humble today|`|0fygxRHLaa	hey boo!  you so crazy!|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	yes good for her! she is very morally correct...|`|YjL6ziBtaa	If she really cared she wouldn't have played.<br>  <br>  It was 100% covering her own ***.<br>  <br>  She took the money and ran.<br>  <br>  If she cares so much why doesn't she donate her winnings to worthy Israeli cause ala Patrick Rafter after he won the U.S. Open.|`|HBnfenrWaa	Wow! Nothing more to say after Catmandu!|`|3NvSUXmqaa	Yes, we need more people like Venus Williams|`|pYieTvDqaa	I agree we need more heros like Venus Williams, she is a huge role model for young girls everywhere. She is a very vocal advocate for players rights and I've been a fan of hers for a long time but she earned even more respect from me when she was very vocal in her opposition to unequal prize money for women at the grandslams which affects me in my career in tennis.  But even more respect for her having words to say against UAE for there discrimination against Shahar Peer after she won Dubai. It is never good to mix politics with sports the Olympics has a history of this and it always ends up being very sad to see, but the UAE did it by denying Peer a visa for Dubai and it's great that Venus had the guts to speak up about it.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	So what do you think of Andy Roddick withdrawing?|`|mUMMLjDdaa	we do need more people like Ms. williams speaking out against<br>  prejudice etc... i could not agree with you more.<br>  i do not believe stanfords, fallout will be a sign of financial<br>  catastrophe in the near furure.

Ferguson knew what he was doing when he sold him to Real and they knew what they were doing when they got rid to LA Galaxy. He satisfied a financial need to sell shirts etc. but there comes a time when football needs becomes more important and that is why he has to move on. Do you recall all the media speculation when he moved to the States and how he was going to revolutionise soccer there .<br>  Funny how his priorities change when something which suits him better comes along.  Does anyone really think Milan want him for his footballing ability and not just for brand Beckham to bring in some extra cash from the commercial activities. As for his last 15-20 caps I believe that his publicity machine has been working behind the scenes to get to 100 and then to surpass Bobby Moore's record for future financial reasons. How many actual minutes has he played in real internationals for his last 15-20 caps?|`|0lACfoXSaa	NO.<br>  <br>  Liverpool fan - Beckham is a great player. He spent many, many years at Man Utd winning everything.

Then went to Galaxy because he thought he was doing the right thing, it didnt work out as he hoped.<br>  <br>  Now he is at AC Milan, a great club, and he is still playing for england and still playing well.<br>  <br>  Thats 4 clubs.

Like what you do is go to the end of your bed and go about shoulder's lenght and go over so that you land on your hands and just flip over.  Then go back.|`|EwY7dIViaa	What you need to do, and what my friend did, was I took a large, high gymnastics mat/cushion called a "cheese". So you don't have to go over as far. Hopefully you know what I mean. Also have an experienced friend or gymnastics coach place their hand on your back so you don't hurt it. <br>  <br>  You could even just start out doing bridges and then work your  way up. Just remember to take it easy and not strain yourself. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Here's a picture of a "cheese" mat.<br>  <a href="http://davidandkelli.com/pics/gymnastics1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://davidandkelli.com/pics/gymnastics...</a>|`|j5rHgDSkaa	You should try workouts that make your abs stronger so that they can pull your body over. Also try pulling your hands and feet closer together while in the bridge, that may help with the pain and make it easier to go over.

KJWxqQHiaa	Well, as said temperature, location, water clarity and others are key in finding the right bait. You did not state if you wanted bait, or lures so i'm assuming you just want to catch a lot of bass. If so, you need ...<br>  <br>  1.) Wide-gap hooks, appropriately sized for bass.<br>  <br>  2.) Water Gremlin removable and/or non-removable split-shot sinkers.<br>  <br>  3.) Some fresh minnows. Either bought from the bait-shop or caught yourself with a minnow trap, or net.<br>  <br>  4.) A decent spinning reel, medium-action rod, and 12 lb. test.<br>  <br>  Just hook the minnow (Try to get large varieties, most small ones get took by crappie, and even bluegill.) in the lips, or however you please, and put the split-shots about a foot and a half from the hook. Let the minnow move freely, and just reel very slowly back. <br>  <br>  That should catch a boat load of bass.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ok, now i will explain lures. Here's what you need to catch bass with lures. (I will explain the plastic worm, one of the most universally used, and effective lure on the market.)<br>  <br>  1.) Worm weights.<br>  <br>  2.) 6" Curly tailed worms. I love the brand Zoom, Culprit are also good ... And if you're on a tight budget, Renegade makes a 20 pack of curly tailed worms for $1.60. I like darker colors, motor oil, black, purple, grape, and blake w/ blue flakes.<br>  <br>  3.) Wide-gap hooks, size just right for 6" worms.<br>  <br>  4.) A good baitcaster, medium-heavy rod, and 14 lb. test.<br>  <br>  Look up the Texas-Rig on Google, you should be able to find out how to rig it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|amlmhoUuaa	My go to bait is a 6" zoom lizard in pumokin seed rigged texas style.  Just try different things.  Spinnerbaits, crankbaits, jig and pig combos. Oneof my favorite is a topwater bait say a buzz bait or a frog.  Just experiment with different lures the bass will tell you what they want.  Good fishing hoped this helped.|`|CBTAgeu4aa	If i want to catch a bass i tie on a rooster tail they mite not catch the biggest fish but they work.<br>  <a href="http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10151_-1_10001_46138_100006002_100000000_100006000_100-6-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores...</a>|`|aEadwhXQaa	The most fun is with a fly rod.  <br>   <br>  The most certain is with live bait.<br>  <br>   Everything else is fun too, but is in between the two extremes.|`|jxUYdSLwaa	My favorite way, is with a spinnerbait.  Carolina lizard is next!|`|lECmz3SEaa	for me live crayfish|`|TGm36rBWaa	Well it depends on the time of year and conditions as to which bait or lure that I will use. But if I had to choose my go to lure it would have to be a zoom fluke in silver rainbow color. <br>  <br>  But with spring on the horizon I will use white spinnerbaits with a willow blade.  <br>  <br>  Also, In spring bass will be staging on main and secondary points. On my trips to Table rock lake in MO, I will use a smithwick deep diving suspending jerkbait with a clown color pattern. But I will also use a spider jigs as well on these points with sharp drop offs or ledges.<br>  <br>  But you can catch Bass on plastic worms, spinners, spoons, lizards and a number of other lures. <br>  <br>  Just remember the clearer the water, the more natural your lure presentation should be. Matching the color and species of the forage of the waters your fishing will be your best bet when choosing lures and colors.<br>  <br>  I know that you are asking what it the best way to catch bass, but it really depends on the conditions, time of year and the lake or waters you are fishing.<br>  <br>  But if you are looking for a no brainer lure, I would have to say a spinnerbait. <br>  <br>  Get on the water and have fun.|`|f3084bd62a52bf53fb3975f82c042565aa	If you're a beginner, use a bait that allows you to cover more water quicker, such as the above mentioned spinnerbaits/crankbaits.

Salmon and cubs have a very small fin, just a small nob of skin, between the dorsal fin and the tail so they can both be ruled out. The first thing I thought of when I looked at the pic was some species of cod or scrod, because of the shape of the mouth. The only snag there is that all of the cod/scrod pics I could find, the dorsal fins are way different than on your fish. Could maybe be in the cod family. Might help if we knew, were you in fresh, brackish, or salt water?|`|TeNIStN1aa	You got yourself a chub.<br>  <br>  Addition:<br>  Like catfish, there are many different kinds of chubs.

xal0P1rNaa	I usually hang mine to dry draped over a tree branch outside.  That way it is drying on something with a large diameter so it doesn't develop pinched areas.  I never hang them on a hanger like a shirt, I either fold them over the bottom part of the hanger or just lay them on top of one of my boards in the board rack in the garage.|`|gUCjkj9oaa	just don't use a metal hanger|`|Op1WIwyPaa	Yes, I use one called "shoulder saver" it is meant for surfing and scuba diving wetsuits.

You will have shoulder nipples in no time and wear your suit out on the shoulder, happen to a friend $50.00 to have them patched. Just put your suit over a railing or something like that to dry. Once suit is completely dry then put it on a hanger, the hanger shouldn't be to thin like a wire hanger. Most suit come with a hanger that is wide on the part that your shoulders will hang on. Remember never dry your suit on a hanger, it will be ten feet long before you know it.GETWET|`|GQemfOANaa	the only potential problem from a wooden hanger is mould...plastic hangers are fine too... see if your surf shop has any wetsuit hangers they can give you, they are generally a little wider meaning the suit sits on them better..dont use wire hangers.|`|yWcPOTsAaa	Hang it over a railing or line.

LALDdLkNaa	All 3 matches were on hard and thats Murrays favourite surface and Nadals least favourite(10 of Nadals 11 defeats came on hard last year) and they are both great players so Nadals not gonna beat Murray every time theres bound to be alot of defeats either way between theese 2 players.<br>  Also 2 of them were best of 3 sets and Nadals more likely to lose the shorter matches he plays(9 of his 11 defeats last year came in best of 3 set matches)<br>  Also Murray relishes playing the Nadal's and Federer's of the game as he really enjoys being up against the best and testing himself.He therefore plays fearlessly against Nadal and that gives him a chance as hes not afraid of Nadal like some people are(mentioning no names here but we all know who I mean) so he's able to produce his best.<br>  <br>  All that said if they meet on grass and on clay Nadal is the definite favourite to win and Nadal will most likely end Murrays winning run against him as soon as they meet on one of theese 2 surfaces.|`|3q8LkLLDaa	murray 0 grand slams<br>  rafa 6<br>  rafa 1" <br>  murray 4<br>  rafa golden olympic medalist<br>  murray in one or 2 years will be the next "would have been great british champion like Henman!<br>  every time murray has win over rafa,he found a tired exhausted rafa!|`|mko359wNaa	Murray and Nadal wre equally matche and looked like the best future players when they were 14. Murray got lazy. His trainer must have put a size 10 boot up his ***.|`|3NvSUXmqaa	Incase you didnt notice, Murray has pretty much been beating everybody this year not just Nadal. He has already beaten Roger Federer and Nadal twice this year. His only loss this year has come to Fernando Verdasco who was just on fire at the australian open.|`|KReWaGFsaa	Simple.<br>  Nadal wasn't in his best condition in the last 3 matches with Murray.<br>  If he was, though, I think he could've won them.|`|Z2gIo6HKaa	thats cos it was mainly on hard court|`|guAFsmNjaa	nadal doesnt care if its not a grand slam|`|OeOjFCXOaa	Murray was just lucky to win the last three matches he had with Nadal. The timing of the matches is always in favor of Murray. <br>  <br>  The first time Nadal lost to Murray at the US Open '08, Nadal has been fully wasted and too tired because of the cramped tennis calendar and because of the demands he had after winning the Beijing Olympics Singles Title Gold Medal on hard court. Remember that Murray was fully rested after being eliminated in the first round at Beijing Olympics.<br>  <br>  Then came the serious knee injury, causing him to miss DavisCUP Finals and Masters Cup in Shanghai.<br>  <br>  The second time Murray defeated Nadal in an final round of an exhibition match in DOHA, he has not played or practiced well enough prior to DOHA, that's why he was very rusty and still very careful and not giving his 100% as the injury may reccur or happen again, sort of fine tuning and adjusting his games.<br>  <br>  Again, in the Rotterdam Finals, Nadal was again injured on his knee. Remember that Nadal just came from winning the AO'09 Grandslam with atotal of 7matches all in best of five sets with Verdasco and Federer giving him 2 successive 5-sets semifinals and finals matches. He had not rested well enough compared to Murray who was eliminated in the fourth round by Verdasco, thus he has rested longer.<br>  <br>  The Rotterdam draws for Nadal was more difficult than Murray. Nadal beat Tsonga, Monfils and the very promising Dimitrov who is the reining junior Wimbledon and US Open Champion.<br>  <br>  Murray was very very lucky  not to face top 10 players. He has to face only weak non-top 20 players like Gicquel who retired, Ancic who is not in his true form prior to the semifinal.<br>  <br>  Murray cannot beat Nadal if Nadal is only 100% healthy and fit in all three surfaces.<br>  <br>  Remember that the H2H record is still 5-2 for Nadal.<br>  <br>  BTW, Nadal beat Murray in Toronto Masters in the Semifinals before the Olympics last year on HARD COURT.|`|d5f3e65ac4895a16eeeeaa09b2857623aa	Well, Murray beat him on a hard court, which is his fave. And I think Murray is able to beat Nadal because of his diverse shot selection.
3NvSUXmqaa	Yes it definitely reduces the prestige of the tournament. But no matter who shows up and who plays, this years Dubai tournament is tainted perhaps forever because of what happened to Shahar Peer.|`|tJnZZ9Tpaa	Though it will be odd to not have some of the top 10 players involved, the tournament still has the likes of Djokovic, Murray, Simon and Cilic who are (usually) exciting to watch. And a win by Djokovic over Murray would be both a boast to his ego as well as more excitement on the tour, given the fact Murray beat Djokovic the last 2 times.|`|n8dBGNYwaa	of course the prestige will be diminished more or less but giving it another thought it only affects the prestige of the men's tournament and it does gives other players a chance to win it... but i think that it is really unfair to peer to ban her a visa just because she is an israeli...|`|YjL6ziBtaa	Of course.

Outside the top 3 positions in the EPL the competition is very average at best. <br>  The fear that their reputation brings to opponents in England just doesn't have a passport, and the big European teams see them as just another one of the top European teams, no better, no worse just a big beatable scalp.<br>  I would guess that Jose Mourinho rubbed his hands when the draw was made, knowing that by dumping Fergie and his MU team out would make this competition all the easier to win.|`|0t8XYZKRaa	Internazionale FC 1-1 Manchester United FC<br>  I want Manchester United to win (im a supporter of them) but I just don't think that they can because Vidic is suspended.

1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	I have caught countless pike on my fluorocarbon leaders when I've been walleye fishing but if you are specifically targeting northern you really need to use steel or titanium leaders.  For my tip up rigs I just buy a spool of American Fishing Wire and make up my own leaders.  It you are talking about casting or trolling for them you will probably want one that has a snap for convenience and ball bearings to keep your line from kinking up.  Good luck!|`|5bf66864f5e85f953cdb3ff01887ae4daa	Its generally a GOOD idea to use them, although its possible to use a heavy co-polymer. Wire coated with nylon will be softer and still not break when the pike bite. You can buy ready made leaders for cheap. i don't suggest buying a spool of wire from Cabelas, its a little expensive, your local bait store should sell cheap lengths of wire to use. The ready made leaders from cabelas are reasonable in terms of price and quality.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/templates/index/index-display.jsp?id=cat20204&navAction=jump&navCount=1&cmCat=MainCatcat20166&parentType=category&parentId=cat20166" rel="nofollow">http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/templa...</a>|`|26864d65d58271ca44e00e9d7936f50caa	we call them a wire trace in Scotland and you will have to use them as our fellow angler says to prevent the fish from biting through a softer trace. we all know the teeth these monsters have! to save money you can make your own traces with crimps and swivel and customise them to whatever bait your gonna use. if your not sure about removing a hook from this dangerous predator i would respectfully suggest you google the method to save losing the odd digit, i nearly did. good fishing to all, JIM.|`|63e4b2a381a37a2a4e488d966800a454aa	You don't have to use them, but there will be less chance of the fish biting through the line if you do use them. You can get inexpensive ones at any tackle store, or most Wal Marts have a good fishing section.|`|113f96e86c976547fe006e5fe6d83fabaa	Wire leaders are a throwback to a time when fishing lines were not the high quality of today's products.<br>  On the downside, they may decrease your success by their weigh and appearance adversely effecting your bait or lure.<br>  I have caught many pickerel, pike and musky using only high quality monofilament line and have not used wire leaders in decades.|`|sosD6fpXaa	wire traces are vital for pike fishing <br>  only irresponsible angles would risk a fish biting though the line and being left with a lure in its mouth permanently as this could prove fatal for the pike in question.<br>  i have never found wire line to limit the number of pike i cacth and how would you feel if you had a huge pike on the end of your line and it bites though your trace??<br>  it is not worth the risk and no one should ever pike fish with out wire traces.|`|f3084bd62a52bf53fb3975f82c042565aa	It depends what kind of bait you're using. When we're up north fishing for bass in the weeds we often catch some big Pike too. I use a heavy braid and have never broke one off. Of course these are lures they most likely won't swallow. If you're using live bait, they may swallow it thus leaving the line rubbing against the teeth. Your call, but I think in general they are pretty inexpensive.|`|c81fa0395c7807a69ecfa0cdd3674cb1aa	if you don't use wire for pike you will need at least a 100lb mono leader,|`|lECmz3SEaa	yes, buy the south bend products or go to walmart|`|N8BbxwrGaa	no mono filament fishing line will survive the teeth of a large pike very long. Wire leaders do make your presentation less natural and under some circumstances turn off a wary fish.  If you are using live bait and your letting the fish take and swallow the bait your cut off chances without a wire leader are nearly 100%. <br>  <br>  If your using lures and you try to strike as soon as the fish touches it so the lure is not swallowed you have a 50- 50 chance, if the fish makes a hard run away from you to the side the line can still work into his teeth.<br>  <br>  A pickerel is no comparison to a northern pike because of size.A northern pike's mouth and teeth are 2 or three times the size of a pickerel and so is it's fight.<br>  <br>  So it is a gamble either way.|`|7royFhIgaa	I caught a 24lb 42inch on 6lb test with a jig several years ago. You don't need one but depending on where they grab your bait you might want one. You can get some lighter ones at walmart.
Dq1T89nOaa	Hey i used to live in Singapore for 2 months. :) I no not very long but I play tennis and at first I didnt no where I could play.  Then I found out that the condo that I was staying at had 4 tennis courts available.  Also when I was staying at a high rise hotel looking at the buildings below, I saw many tennis courts on top of buildings.  I think thats where most of the courts are located and they are private facilities.  You may have to ask around to get a court but now worries, they are there.  You just need to look hard.
KTxxd700aa	Well in FIA's endless ifs buts and maybes laws, there is provision for 24 cars (12 teams), this is from a few years back when Prodrive was on the verge of entering F1 and Aguri were still chugging around.<br>  Problem was back the, it looked like customer cars (2 teams with same car different livery) would be banned, leaving Prodrive out.<br>  Things are worse now, though customer cars may be an option, its finding a company that's willing to spend ￡40+ million a year on what probably be back of the grid racing. Also many possible sponsors have shunned F1 due to tobacco laws, environment and serious lack of money.<br>  Hopefully Honda will pull through somehow and this mysterious US F1 team will go ahead.|`|f71bc553ce48de0d47d00ce15fd871aaaa	as of right now customer cars are banned, you have to build your own car, its a lot better to purchase an existing team in place than it is to buy a facility and begin procuring all the necessary people and equipment, even toyota who came into the money with more money than god bought an existing team based in Cologne (spelled it wrong im sure) germany than starting from scratch|`|IuwVj2kGaa	I′m not sure there are many takers right now. With the expected change of rules is not a good idea to enter F1 at the moment, because Your whole business model can be destroyed a few months after. Potential teams and sponsors are very aware of this situation. On the other hand the economic downturn means many potential sponsors will spend more carefully their money an that means less into F1.|`|5VSAuCwiaa	I don't think you understand the situation. Bernie offered to buy Honda because there was nobody else willing to do so. Right now, F1 teams are not sustainable as a business and nobody wants to lose money. Starting your own team from scratch would be even worse. The only reason why Bernie is willing to invest in that team is because he wants to bring Bruno Senna into the sport. The marketing value of his name is huge so he sees it as an investment for Formula 1. But certainly the team itself will not make him or anyone else any money.<br>  <br>  Years ago, when a team was selling, they would receive phone calls from everywhere. But the situation is so bad that a team with great facilities and engineers, including Ross Brawn, can't find a buyer. The cost cutting for 2010 seems to have convinced some people to join in. The USF1 team has succesfully applied to participate next year and Max seems to respect them a lot.|`|0eys8EDqaa	tell this 2 bernie

There are a few places that manufacture the engines.  They did not really say who did, but they did say that the same company that manufactures Hendricks also did Gibbs.

468e5cy8aa	All the things you can do to your bike to make it faster are insignificant to the things you can do to yourself. Spending lots of money will result in a bike that might be 10 - 15 percent faster. Spending lots of time riding can double your speed. Develop a training plan and stick to it.<br>  <br>  Eddy Merckx was, arguably, the greatest bicycle racer of all time. He said, "Ride lots."<br>  <br>  HTH|`|DOVbF4Piaa	The best thing to do is get more training.  Learn to pedal at a high cadence 70-90 rpm's with a lite pressure on the pedals.  That will allow you body to use fat as a fuel and wont tire out you legs.  You want to pedal with a lite pressure and get your breathing to the point where you can still talk but not sing. If you need to catch your breath drop down a gear or two and keep your rpm's around 70.  The more you ride the stronger you get.  You can go hard for a short distance and then recover, keep doing this every so often and you will see an improvement.|`|z4Yeofq8aa	Ultra thin treadless tyres, aerobars, clipless pedals are all features that are conducive to improving efficiency so they help you cycle faster.|`|hNHp9woaaa	apply oil to the bearings and a lot of exercise.|`|Gn9vurw4aa	Pedal quickly or travel downhill|`|h4Sc2JDwaa	pedal faster!

1jPiAkP4aa	In the cycling community, there is a lot of hate going around. It's mostly frustrated professional wannabes, that can't understand how he could have won seven tours de france without taking drugs. All the evidence against him has been proven to be speculation, and even manufactured (like the case of the 'positive' urine samples from his '99 tour using a test that has now been discredited). There was the case of another pro who alleges that he admitted doping to his doctors when he was being treated for cancer, but the doctors and nurses have all stated he never made those statements.<br>  <br>  I don't know if he took any drugs or not. I do know that since he came back from cancer and started winning big races (not just the tour) that cycling in the US has seen a massive, beautiful renaissance, and there are now more larger races even at the local level than anyone alive has ever seen, and more people supporting both the races and the riders.<br>  <br>  Is he a bastard? sure. His work ethic is militaristic, and he doesn't accept failure as an option. He has alienated many professional riders with his aggressive nature and fight to the death attitude. but, he's a winner. In bike racing, if you want to win, you have to be aggressive, "ya gotta get mean". It's what won him the world championship when he was 21, and what helped him survive cancer.<br>  <br>  The lance haters really either need to come up with something new, or shut up about it. They're starting to sound more and more like right wing radio talk show hosts.|`|9oiZ6Rmbaa	He is an amazing athlete.  He will always be known as one of the best cyclists of al time.  <br>  <br>  It is unfortunate that the sport cycling and some cyclists are the targets of suspicion when it comes to cheating with performance enhancing drugs.  It seems they unable to prove their innocence even without any proof of guilt.  It must have been a tough decision for Lance to make a comeback knowing he will always be a cheating suspect.<br>  <br>  He is also an inspiration to people for beating cancer.
DRPhJnXzaa	Feb. 23, 2009 - 10:14 a.m. ET <br>   <br>  Owner Jerry Jones said he would be surprised if the Cowboys made a big splash in free agency. <br>   <br>  Dallas is up against the salary cap, and Jones is concerned about ramifications of an uncapped year in 2010. Ray Lewis would certainly qualify as a big splash, but staying in Baltimore remains the most likely scenario. <br>   <br>  Source: Dallas Morning News <br>   <br>   Feb. 21, 2009 - 7:22 p.m. ET <br>   <br>  Ravens GM Ozzie Newsome says he remains optimistic Baltimore will re-sign free agent Ray Lewis, but admitted that economics will play a big role. <br>   <br>  It sounds like the Ravens still hope Lewis takes a discount. "He realizes where our football team is," Newsome said. "You know of his relationship with (owner) Steve (Bisciotti). But economics always play a big part." <br>   <br>  Source: Baltimore Sun <br>   <br>   Feb. 21, 2009 - 1:30 p.m. ET <br>   <br>  DeMarcus Ware says free agent Ray Lewis has told him that his interest in playing for the Cowboys is genuine. <br>   <br>  Ware says Lewis told him "I want to wear this star on my helmet, that's my dream." Ware would obviously love for Lewis to come to Dallas, but this is probably just a power play. Lewis is meeting Ravens officials this weekend. <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  So its unlikely but we all know Jerry Jones isn't afraid to go get the "big one" even when he says he won't. I say though its unlikely because the Cowboys have a lot of players they have to address before they even get to Ray Lewis , personally I also think Ozzie Newsome is smart enough to know letting Lewis get out of town would not be a smart fiscal move for the team or its fan base .|`|wxXguyK3aa	I don't think so.  Ray Lewis is very important to the Ravens great defense.  Without him, they wouldn't be the same.  They will do almost anything to keep him in Baltimore.

They are now freeing up cap room for him and if not him bart scott.|`|uAibwdMHaa	no....b'more will break the bank for him...4get a Recession!!!!|`|jpWtZUEqaa	I think Ray Lewis will stay in Baltimore because I honestly dont believe any team will pay him more then what the Ravens are willing to. He wants somewhere in the range of 9 to 10 million dollars when his actual market value is somewhere around 4 or 5 million dollars, with the Ravens offering him somewhere around 6 million dollars. The Jets dont have the money to pay him more then 6 million dollars a year. And I seriously doubt, even with all the reports, that Jerry Jones is willing to break the bank for him, seeing as the Cowboys are not in that great of cap shape either. Once he hits the open market and realizes his agent is feeding him a crock of bull with his 10 million market value estimation, he will go back to Baltimore.|`|d44b17c6ab9967bce78b16440c87b6edaa	heard on ESPN that Lewis told Ware to put in a good word for him to Jerry Jones and at the Pro Bowl he told Ware that he wanted to play on the same team if the Cowboys are willing to match or outbid the Ravens I see it happening|`|7n1cLiahaa	Actually its a yes and no. Since Ray Lewis i quiting from the Ravens we actually don't know what team he would go to even though he a good part of the Raven defense.|`|aFGbh9FAaa	No...He will either stay with ravens or the Jets will prob. get him beacause the new head coach for the jets used to be ravens d-fence cordinator and he likes Ray Lewis|`|8Be0iMN5aa	Maybe.

irljnVkAaa	I really hope so. Their fans annoy me so much, They still think that they are a big club because of their past. When they played Plymouth Argyle at the beginning of the season, they all thought that they would beat "little Plymouth" despite the fact that they are only an average league one side at best and we are an established championship side. Hopefully they will go down and their supporters might see that they aren't a big club at all.|`|d1MN9G31aa	looks like it|`|bR5Dzulsaa	As a Swansea fan I lost interest in the promotion race in League 1 towards the end of the season because we were already up by a mile, having outclassed everybody else in the league.<br>  <br>  But I couldn't believe that Forest went up! It was amazing! They were so bad last season. Way too defensive and completely boring.<br>  <br>  Then in the summer they spent millions on attacking players but that idiot Calderwood refused to change his style of play!<br>  <br>  So Billy Davies inherited a very difficult situation.

W6jjsiMxaa	the ring isn't the measuring stick on who's better, it's the past what important is now.|`|GswnLKtQaa	d-wade's just being overshadowed now because d-wade's team is weak while james's team is a contender. I believe d-wade is the best player now. imagine where the heat last year from worst to 5th seed this year and our line-up is so young. melo has alot to prove because unlike james he never played at the finals. d-wade is in the same situation kobe did back in 2005-2007.|`|61L9P2tQaa	having the ring doesnt make him a better player. u cant really argue against him being the best play though. his weekness is that he is a terrible three point shooter. but he is excellent defensively and a amazing scorer. he and lebron are on that same level. they both have the weekn 3 point shot. but they are as good as u can be in every oter aspect. carmelo is up there but not at their level. he doesnt always show up to play. he has games where it seems like he isnt putten it all out there. carmelo has had tht talent to get to the finals but they dont have the defense or chemistry. until now lebron hasnt had the supporting cast. wade had what he needed. lebron is more of an unstoppable force which is the biggest factor if i were to pic a player to build around. but as far as skill they are wade and bron are on same level.|`|qVMg9YRsaa	I don't think a ring determines Who is better, although it may determine who's TEAM was better at the time they won a championship... Let's not forget D-Wade had a dominant Shaq... give Lebron Shaq right now and he's going to win a championship... <br>  D-Wade is great, he's better than Melo to me... but if I've got a number one pick between the three of them, I'm going with Lebron!!!|`|oukdaIVUaa	wade is great so is lebron hard to say. Kobe and garnett are up there also. I think lebron will get his ring also.|`|qqkz7FSfaa	Okay if Lebron would have had Shaq that year then Lebron would have a ring. Lebron doesnt have half the talent that Dwade had on his team the championship year.|`|3yHJFp1Kaa	ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? A ring does not prove that a player is better than another. Who did Wade have on his team when they won the finals? The best big man in the game. James Posey, Antonie Walker, Udonis Haslem, Jason Williams, Alonzo Mourning, Jason Kapono, James Posey. <br>  <br>  When the Cavs went to the finals LeBron just had Big Z and Eric Snow who were any good. Sure they had Varejao and Gibson then, but they weren't performing well.
AA12182478	hi there, last june i made a hind sight for my martin saber, it is not as pretty as the boughten one but works the same way, it is mounted under a 1 pin adjustable front sight, i shoot 3 inch groups at 40 yards, and 2 inch groups at 25 yards, a couple things i have found:1 after it is set up you will find that bow tourqe is eliminated as you now are putting the front sight dot in the v to shoot ,any wrist flex is instantly noticed. 2 beacuse of the short span between back and front sights only a small lift or lowering of your ancher point is needed for longer or shorter distances, that was the hardest thing for me to get used to as i have used the same ancher point for 35 years, but with some practice i am now confident in my shots , it is better than the peep and easyer to see in low light,good luck and good shooting.|`|0tpLq6meaa	Been in bowhunting and archery for a lifetime. Getting fed up with the peep sight and it's problems.There's got to be a better method.  The peep sight is almost stone age technology I have read all the reviews on the hind sight eliminator and the no peep bow sight. Both have gotten almost all 5 star reviews. Going to order the no peep and try it first. I believe anything that will give you better vision of your sight in low light conditions, and will make you use the same consistent form on every shot will be worth the money. Especially since most of my shooting is done out of a tree stand, where proper form is harder to maintain.You need to try it out. I sure am. Good luck!|`|85faaa69d9e3fef474608806f4554398aa	Stick with the peep sight. It gives you a longer sight radius which translates to better accuracy. If the Hind Sight worked everyone would be using one. Go with the proven method.

XQoH9ZI5aa	Most teams employ a version of the trap throughout games. Minnesota and New Jersey just really practiced it to the nth degree so they get the brunt of the abuse. It is within the rules so what is the big deal? Former Blackhawk Troy Murray? He should know better IMO. <br>  <br>   There is no way to rid it from the game....you can't force teams to forecheck all their forwards. The elimination of the center line (the neutral zone was also made smaller if I recall correctly) just makes teams use different systems now......they still clog the neutral zone but we see more collapsing down low.<br>  <br>   Doesn't bother me whatsoever. In fact I think Lemaire is the best coach in the NHL because he teaches defensive hockey better than anyone else. Like I said, all teams will do it, Minnesota is just better and they will do it in a tie game and wait for a mistake whereas alot of other teams will employ it more when protecting a lead (having one forechecker and taking away the neutral zone).<br>  <br>   Also, IMO......the trap didn't slow down the game......it was more due to the fact that the trap was overly effective because not only could you clog the middle of the ice BUT you could impede their forwards progress via clutching and grabbing or whatever.....that is what slowed it down.<br>  <br>   You also see many teams use the "left wing lock" which is just another trap. High trap. Low trap. 2-3 trap.1-2-2 trap. Trap trap trap.<br>   I think the Wings often use the left wing lock system. Wild and Devils always take the heat!|`|Hki3AoL5aa	i hate it because for some reason the caps always have trouble with it and then nothing gets done.  Trap games become snoozer games too.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	It's boring, but it's beatable.<br>  The trap is at its most annoying when it's used by a team full of "skilled" players.  Before the salary cap era began, teams like Dallas and Detroit would stock up on highly skilled players and still use the trap (apologies to Wings fans...the "left-wing lock").  That was horrid because it sucked the skill out of the league and forced everyone into using a trap of their own.|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	I'm a Devils fan, Lemaire adapted that style of play in NJ, it wins games, NJ is 1st in the East with a modified trap system. 1st place is far from boring to me. The criticizing is frustration on the teams that can't break the trap.|`|VWLtJoX2aa	IMO defensive hockey is exciting to watch.  You always have to be watching for an offense to do something spectacular.  I don't settle for mediocrity.  I think it is disgusting hockey when they play bad defense.|`|Um59i2H1aa	i can't provide the depth of comment like some on here, but simply said, there is nothing illegal about the "style of play". to abuse a quote intended for a sport w/ more obvious separation between offense and defense...<br>  <br>  "it's the offense's job to score, and the defense's job to stop them from scoring." if you don't like it, beat it. and not just beat it, but exploit it. until it's beaten, don't blame a team for using it. there is no such thing as style points. just the scoreboard at the end of the game. and i'm a proponent of the 2 line pass, btw.<br>  <br>  the type of team that would do well against the NZT, may not do well against other "styles" of other teams. just goes to show, that generally speaking, no ONE team has a monopoly on the NHL. there is more parity, and one's strength can also be its weakness, if properly exploited. you have to pick your poison, and play to your strengths, and take some risks. blah blah blah.
mqgS6Dfxaa	92 wins and Central Division champs.  Bullpen killed them last year and they've greatly improved in that area.

I think they'll win their division, by four or five games at least.|`|ehMPOlefaa	I'm hoping for another 21 wins better than last season's total.

Can Fausto Carmona show his '07 self, not the mediocre-at-best pitcher we saw last year?<br>  <br>  2.) Can Victor Martinez find some power again? For that matter, can anyone in that offense find some power besides Sizemore?<br>  <br>  3.) Will the rotation be decent enough to keep them in?<br>  <br>  I can only really answer #2 and #3; Hafner and Garko possess the talent, but have been extremely hot-and-old recently. Peralta was a nice surprise, but SS aren't the best source for power.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, Pavano and Reyes scare me in that rotation. Not in a good way.<br>  <br>  Those who knock Kerry Wood as closer should've seen the bullpen struggles of last year, plus Wood's numbers from the previous two seasons (34 SV last year...if he doesn't flop in the second half, he's money...that's the biggest risk, that "if" factor)|`|961e6dcab726e0a100d82ac13535cd8aaa	If their starting pitching holds up, they have a great chance to win the Central.

wMvd9x06aa	A rowing machine works more on a cardiovascular workout ( more raising your heart rate and working on fat loss ,stamina and toning) while regular weights builds up muscle mass by creating micro rips or tears in the muscles so they grow back stronger . A combination of Cardio ( so treadmill, cross trainer , rowing machine ) and free weights and benchpress would give good results for chest size, you should also consider pullups , It is one of the best and easiest ways to increase general upper body strength aswell as your lats , hope this helps :)|`|DeSCJn0paa	If you just use the rowing machine i don't think you could gain much mass from that. And also your muscles would get use to the exercise so you definitely wouldn't gain any mass from that. I think weights would be your best bet. You can easily change up your excises and add more weight.

RjQLB9s1aa	My son took a similar journey where he needed really supportive shoes (the heel area especially). We saw a podiatrist to get the correction to his inserts, to correct his stance, and they recommended Mizuno, Asics or New Balance, to get the support he needed. They said that you will be surprised at well known brands & what little support they offer.<br>  <br>   Tip 1: Look for symbols or writing on the heel, forefront or under the shoe. They may not make sense so ask the one of the staff to tell you what it means. For example, asics SoLyte means that improved cushioning and durability.<br>  <br>  There are some basic differences in shoes for running, walking, tennis or netball. Think of the way your foot moves when doing these activities. Running has pressure on the forefront, walking on the heel, and both usually have a straight, forward motion. Playing tennis or netball requires a lot of side movement, changing direction and good grip. Running and walking shoes will be more flexible, bending in the same place your foot bends, and will have a hardwearing outsole for uneven surfaces. When walking, the initial contact of the shoe is more central, so the heel strike zone needs to be larger. There is less forward momentum when walking so the shoe needs increased forefoot flexibility. Tennis and netball shoes will be firmer, heavier, and will have a flat, herringbone type outsole for good grip on flat surfaces.<br>  <br>  Tip 2: Look at the outsole of the shoe. Look for grip patterns, flexibility breaks, and check the strength of the mid-sole. Does the shoe feel heavy? Mesh shoes are lighter and breath more.<br>  <br>  What is pronation? An underpronator usually has a high arch and favours the outside of the feet when walking, or turning feet inwards. They may feel increased shock to the lower limb. An under pronator should avoid shoes with arch support as this may push the foot out even more. An over pronator rotates the foot when walking or running causing splayed feet. The knees may turn in and knock together when running. Most people pronate to some degree, and require footwear with good support as well as cushioning.<br>  <br>  Tip 3: Look for support on the instep, inside and outside of the shoe. On asics this is called Duomax, is a darker colour, and is firmer, than the white EVA cushioning. Mizunos use a wave plate to provide support. Ask the staff to show you the support in the shoe.<br>  <br>  Tip 4: Buy the shoe you want. Don't avoid running shoes because you don't run, they are very comfy for everyday wear. A trainer, sometimes called cross-trainer, can be used for walking, running, gym and is a good all round everyday fitness shoe.<br>  <br>  Most of the time you will get what you pay for. Sports shoes range from $80-$260. The features kick in at about $100.You can get a very solid, supportive sports shoe for about $120-$150.

4gZYucHMaa	Of course you can, you can run at any age. People who run make goals all the time not just a teenager on a track team. My parents are in their 60's running marathons. <br>  <br>  Running is for the ageless!|`|EvhyVrBuaa	god I hope you still run...it is the key to help with depression.  OF COURSE you can still be a good runner without running for your schools team.  You should be able to enjoy it. You have the right tools, as you mentioned, documenting your progress is a great idea.  Don't forget to take rest days and vary your workouts, keep it interesting.  It sounds like you already have the base of being a good runner.  KEEP RUNNING :)<br>  <br>  train smart and run happy is my motto.|`|QEyCJyF9aa	yes but you have no idea how much harder you're making it on yourself.  You can be laid back and "type B" and all that and still be good but working with a coach that knows A LOT more than you will help you so much more than if you go at it solo.  There's gonna be a coach in college too man, that never changes, besides, if you want to be good you should be more on yourself than a coach could ever be....I have depression too and have been through that whole bit but you need to go back to a team to have a chance at getting really good|`|abnqs0jQaa	Of course you can! While colleges will tend to look at the times you would post against competition in high school races, you can obviously keep up the running and training as preparation for college.  Trying to run when you lose motivation is no fun, I had that issue after a series of injuries as a senior in high school. It definitely hurt my prospects as a collegiate runner, but I retrained myself and ended up making top 7 as a freshman in college, before the injury bug bit again.<br>  <br>  You might have to do some self-promotion if you want to run in college and get a scholarship (depending on jsut how good you are...). Scholarships would be based off high school performances, so foregoing your competitive year might hurt your chances. That being said, you could partake in USATF junior olympic races, as these could garner some attention if you perform well enough, without having to deal with the anxiety of an overbearing coach and pressure from a team to perform at a high level for their benefit. There are also the regionals you could run like the precurser to nationals run at Van Cortland Park. No team issues there, yet again. So I would say look into these options if by seasons end you feel motivated enough to take on some competition and potentially increase your exposure.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, and don't give up on the collegiate running idea. Hard training on your own and a steady regimen could still prove to benefit you in the long run!

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	I have been a "union man" for 33 years, and I have seen some of my union brothers get fired for fighting.  But every one of those who were fired were fired for instigating the fight.  Those acting in self-defense were not disciplined in any way.<br>  <br>  I'm having a hard time believing some of the stuff this guy wrote, specifically the actions and demeanor of the Arbiter.  Arbiters are generally lawyers and judges who are paid to arbitrate disputes.  They are professional and unbiased.  They can't risk being labeled as this guy describes the Arbiter in his case, or they would lose that job, and might be subjected to prosecution themselves.<br>  <br>  To be honest, I think Mr. Olsen instigated the fight himself, and is fabricating some pre-conceived notions on the part of the Arbiter to explain the ruling against him.  I have no doubt there was a fellow worker "testing him" (every work place has guys like that), but I think Mr. Olsen made it physical himself, to shut the guy up.<br>  <br>  That said, I think the average person (those who aren't wrestling fans) see pro wrestling as something like a play, or more likely, something vaudevillian (and not taken seriously).  And they see pro wrestlers as "actors", entertainers who pretend to fight for a living.<br>  <br>  In previous generations, when kayfabe was fiercely protected by the wrestlers, average people did see them as "tough guys" you don't mess with.  But now that everybody knows the fights aren't real, that perception has gone away.  Pro wrestlers are just athletic "actors" in the average person's eyes.  Their level of fame determines how much attention they get from average people.  If they do their jobs and don't try to use their "fame" to get special attention or privileges, or to try to bully others, then they will be accepted as a "regular" guy.|`|mysuLVovaa	Thats mess up becouse there being unfair to the prowrestler's.Some one should do something about it.|`|I4HPyJ0oaa	yeah <br>  i agree with you|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	Pro-wrestling is a sport and a Art Form at the same time The person here that said it not a sport Then Basketball is not a sport then football is not a sport and Golf is not a sport I mean wrestling is more with people throwing their body around I don't see any other sport doing that wrestling is not Fake it is a sport that as more viewer then golf or NFL or NBA it true Look at the Rating for monday football when wrestling on NFL go down and wrestling go up does anybody watch Golf? and this sport been around since 1908 and longer!|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Very interesting comments, I have to admit. I'm not saying I totally agree but I don't dismiss the fact that the perception of pro-wrestling is sometimes skewed. I however don't look at Pro-wrestling as a sport but I do see the wrestlers as athletes. I help promote wrestling so I look at it as a business with very talented athletes who entertain fans. Yes, I have always loved wrestling even knowing it was scripted. I enjoy it for what it is and that is entertainment.

There is no way you can get all of them correct.<br>  <br>  Bucknor's record over time is as good as anyones.

My heart tells me to believe the mistakes were due to fatigue and old age, but mind disagrees: the so called 'mistakes' , were mostly targeted in one direction, and you start wondering....... Once, I even saw him laughing spontaneously when Dravid was caught out. Let's give him the benefit of doubt, and say these were human errors: then he was an incompetent umpire. During the Sydney fiasco, many Indians were asking for Simon. In spite of him being an australian we know he'll be impartial. That's the integrity an umpire should have, otherwise it's better to be looking for some other employment.        Mistakes.. anybody can accept, but.....|`|tz7JEqstaa	I can't believe that a nice guy like Steve Bucknor is or was capable of cheating. He made errors due to (I'm guessing here) loss of concentration and possibly diminishing eyesight. Who in their right mind, with all the technology available today, would ruin 20 years of faultless umpiring deliberately?|`|SWxnbKyyaa	I don't think he is capable of cheating or getting bribe but there could be two reasons<br>  <br>  1.Age and fatigue which could have led to errors in judgment like many said.Other-wise he was a very good umpire, remember Jonty Rhodes run-out in 1992 WC, he was the umpire who gave it out without going for third umpire.In this way he has become incompetent<br>  <br>  But that's not all<br>  <br>  2.Umpires are also sometimes fans of the game where they may like a particular team, okay although they are supposed to unbiased, sometimes there is a tendency to show favoritism or bias against a team.<br>  <br>  But this is not something that is really unheard or unseen<br>  <br>  I feel these two factors must be the cause for his poor umpiring|`|IDBasYahaa	I'm sick of India calling everyone else in the world cheats just because a decition didn't go there way!<br>  Check out this video, India cheats too!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNCdD7KC9eI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNCdD7KC9...</a>|`|fsLMFIpgaa	He was never a cheat, that's just sore losers talking.

You can even get full-auto if you jump the right hoops.|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	Check your State Laws. Laws vary state-to state.. <br>  <br>  The AWB federal law was sunsetted in 2004.

Under the last "assault weapons" ban, certain features such as folding stocks, flash suppressors, and high-capacity magazines were illegal, but the guns themselves were not.|`|wORqCGlyaa	depend what state you live in but generally no as long as its a semi auto. if you want or have a full auto you need a class III license from ATF which will run you $200 and a ton of paperwork.|`|jkU8hHrlaa	I live in MO and own one and its completely legal. Plus its a fun weapon to own.|`|AWZGNyAhaa	As long as you don't get a full-auto AK, or modify it to where it's full auto.

That is why they dont use backboard,because they cant afford realistic engine play.|`|NKN7HwkYaa	get on the bus.<br>  Nba Live has been garbage ever since....somewhere around 98.

lYlZTIIHaa	Many people have problems with their knees when they run. The first thing I would recommend is to get new shoes. My favorite brand is Asics, most of my xc teammates like Mizuno. It really depends on you. If you go to a store like Tri Sports or Run for your Life they fit you specifically for your type of foot. Also you can get athletic wrap (not tape) and wrap it below you knee. That prevents your knee from moving more than it needs too. That helps with the pain if it is under and beside the knee cap. You also can always buy a knee brace at Rite Aid or something. Do not get use to using one it is a temporary relief of pain it's not a god ide to get use to it. Also heat before you work out and ice afterwards. Try to take at least one day off a week. If it continues to hurt then seek other ways of working out or see a doctor. <br>  Hope this helps :-)|`|9uI3hvGdaa	It's possible your knees could be hurting due to body misalignment.  Check out your feet to see if you are pronating, supinating, flat footed or claw footed.  Also, check your hip height to see if they are even.  If it is your feet, you may be able to support your feet with inserts and run without knee pain.|`|Akt4uZsAaa	i think you should switch shoes and do some warm up exercises with ur legs b4 u run...%|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	it is your body telling you to stop running.  My sister had the same problem you do and didn't listen to her doctors and her body and now can barely even walk at 47.  running is very damaging to the knees.|`|WItdtl0Vaa	When you run on the road, try to run on the grass next to the sidewalk or road. You could also get shoe inserts.|`|e6c858bfb97dfe44696f0bf685c36886aa	I sometimes have the same problem.  I've been running now for 5 years and have run 3 marathons and a ton of 1/2 marathons. <br>   <br>  I'm sure you know that when you run in the trails, it slows you down about 1/2 minute to a minute slower a mile than when you run on the street.<br>  <br>  One thing I do before I run any type of long distance (over 6 miles), is I massage my knee area real well.  When I forget, I pay the price, so I know this has helped me.  Also, you may want to try taking a ice bath (knees and below) for  5- 10 min after a run as well or go to a cold pool if you can.  <br>  <br>  With shoes, you should go to your local running club and see what the best shoe store is in town.  Good shoes stores will have a treadmill or someone who can watch you walk and help you pick the right shoe for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|eVvohzxMaa	Okay-I bet you have the same problem as me!<br>  <br>  Okay here is what you need to do---<br>  <br>  1.)Get a pair of shoes that have really good support<br>  2.)Stretch your knees, claves, and thighs daily<br>  3.)Take Ibeprophen to reduce inflammation<br>  4.)Buy a knee brace<br>  5.)Drink lots of water<br>  6.)Ice and elevate it<br>  <br>  Pretty soon your knee should be great!|`|lSvcX175aa	my sis Kollyn and I wear knee braces.

(takes a minimum of 5 full years IF you trained 3+ days weekly and IF you passed all promotions (2-3 per year))<br>  <br>  some good things to ask<br>  does it look like it is challenging or boring?  are the students disciplined or doing anything they please (is there someone instructing or helping anyone who is trying to figure something out)?<br>  <br>  a good question to ask is, what is the solid monthly rate (or weekly)?  if they want to bring you in on the phone because they have all sorts of "programs", they are probably just taking you for a ride. why a program? cant you train with any of the classes that you are good enough to train in?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  how long have the assistant instructors been studying the art? do all of the students and the teacher seem humble and personable (or are there lots of cocky, egotistical people?)?<br>  <br>  hope I've helped, it is all about the instruction and environment in my opinion!|`|LnJjS8BRaa	Which ever is taught the best. It's not a satisfying answer but you really need to see what's available to you in your area. Don't be afraid to visit the schools and try as many classes out as possible. You'll find that some schools stand out over the others and these are where you want to focus your attention.<br>  <br>  The style isn't as important as how well it is taught.

The bottom line is alway the instructor rather than the style. Styles are like cars. There are many different kinds but they are all just modes of transportation. Instructors vary greatly. You need to find one that is well trained in a traditional art. He should be someone that is more interested in teaching skills than in promoting his students to belt ranks.<br>  <br>  Avoid any school that requires you to sign a black belt contract, or any long term contract.

I highly recommend it.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	I would look for either a good boxing/kickboxing gym or even Muai Thai gym.  They don't get wrapped up in teaching katas and are not kata crazy.  While I am a big proponent of katas and what they do for people they take a big proportion of time for most students.  Those with limited time and looking more for the practical aspects of self-defense don't have enough time to attend and to learn and develop their skills to a much higher level through kata.  I dropped or reduced several kata requirements for my karate students just to give them more time to develop those that they do have to a higher level while also giving them more time for developing their fighting and self-defense skills for that reason.  If none of those types of gyms or schools are available then look for a good karate school that is not kata crazy and has a strong self-defense program.  Having strength is always nice but strength without training and technique is blunted and not near as effective.  I spare and roll with guys much bigger, younger and stronger than me all the time and it is their lack of knowledge, skill, and technique that really works against them and leads to their undoing.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	LA has a good answer. You need to do your research and find the best taught school. This will maximize what you get out of the time you train.<br>  <br>  Martial arts really aren't one of those things you can take short cuts with and get great results. You will have to dedicate time to it for good results. I'm not saying you have to live there but attending class a few hours a week is a minimum. Outside of class work on what you can before bed and again when you wake up. <br>  <br>  Feel free to go to the gym if dedicating time to martial arts isn't your thing. You'll have to spend just as much time if not more lifting weight to get "big" so pick which ever interests you the most.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that being "big" doesn't mean you can fight. A lot of weight lifters have power but lack endurance and flexibility. Their muscles can also hinder striking power as well so keep this in mind if you have to be able to defend yourself.<br>  <br>  Do you research, find the best martial arts school in your area and see if it's something you'll enjoy. Good Luck.|`|ydoIYwGTaa	Even though you cannot spend a lot of time attending classes; you certainly don't want to waste the your time on just any class. I would strongly recommend you do your homework on this by finding out what is in your neighborhood and is close to your home or work. After you do that, attend each location, watch a class first to see if it interests you and then attend one class (nearly ever place will let you try the first class for free, if they don't they are a McDojo and just want your money... walk away). After you have spent some time looking at the different Arts then you can make an informed decision.<br>  IMO... I would look into Aikido, Krav Maga or Judo according to what you say you are looking for.|`|M0qoqvJbaa	Just stay a fat, lazy mid thirties man and ride out your premature mid life crisis in comfort.  No point in losing any more hair worrying about how to accomplish something useless without inputting effort or even time.

M0qoqvJbaa	If you join a boxing gym and start boxing training it's not like you're being tossed into a world title fight and dragged out for every round.<br>  <br>  There's absolutely no way a girl or a boy starts even sparring until they've proven they're ready for it.  Sparring supervised, with larger gloves, and headgear and no intention to cause any injury to your partner.  You would of course be matched up with someone of relatively equal size/weight and skill.  Even that would only be done if you want to do it, I'm sure no one would force you, or even try to coerce you into the ring.<br>  <br>  Past that, if you really had the desire, dedication and showed enough skill in sparring and in the rest of your training you could compete in amateur matches.  Amateur matches are again supervised, with headgear and large gloves, matched very strictly based on relatively identical gender, weight, age and experience.  You also won't go more than three, two minute rounds in an amateur bout, the key difference between this and sparring however is that your opponent may have the intention to harm you.<br>  <br>  Once you become of age if you've amassed enough experience in amateur boxing competition you could have the opportunity to turn pro.  Here is where I would venture to say women really don't suffer the same risks as men simply because the female competition is typically not as stiff due to there being so many disproportionately fewer female pros and the fact that women of the same size simply don't hit as hard as men do.<br>  <br>  <br>  That's all a long way off.<br>  <br>  Train boxing if you want to train.  You're not going to spar if you don't want to.  If you do want to spar, do it with headgear and a mouthguard (no one would let you otherwise anyway, even as an adult).|`|HuSlCMC6aa	Yup, even with head gear and other protection. It is a serious sport, you can get hurt.|`|nr1g0tcLaa	Hi ! I boxed 40 years! yes you can get hurt ? you can get hurt walking down the street? train hard,exersize vigoriously,whare your mouth piece, whare head gear protect yourself at all times? you should be alright. yes my nose got broken a few times, my jaw got hit a few times, but over all i'd like to say i'm still alive and have most of my sense! i can hold my own up against a punk or thug!|`|tuULGJS6aa	Women can get hurt but not as badly as men, for the simple reason that women can't punch as hard as men.|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	Getting hurt is unavoidable.  I don't think that the women boxers take as much brain damage for the simple reason they don't hit as hard..  But you'll definitely suffer brain damage, all boxers do.  Whether or not it's enough to debilitate you is unknown.

Evu9Eq06aa	Maybe they could find a way because Tarvaris Jackson to me is just a downgraded version of Michael Vick. But if Vick does go tho the Vikings, that would be a nice team to play with in Madden 2010 with Adrian Peterson, Vick, and the great defense.|`|wxXguyK3aa	No.  They need a throwing QB.  They have Adrian Peterson for their running game.  Vick would fit in better to a team that needs a running game.|`|2VGbJtnCaa	If Brad Childress let go Dante Culpepper because he was a problem! What makes people think he would take a chance on Vick? They should sign Jeff Garcia or give John David Booty a chance to win the job!|`|op4fEbEVaa	YES|`|pDrm6J2Taa	There is no way that Michael Vick would be picked up by the Viks. The reason being because the Falcons have a contract still in place with him, by now they owe him a lot of money. Idon'tt think the Viks would trade someone for him, and then pay that much money for a man who could be suspended by the league upon his return. So no way.|`|jLM4Yo32aa	Na<br>   ......................,-'′ . . . _,,,,,';:-,................<br>  ....................,-(c\ \`;-=′,_,-~-, \`...............<br>  ..................,/ . . .ˉ'\, o ,/.'-~°,' .ˉ`'-,.........<br>  ................../ . . . . . .ˉ,_ ~--~',, . . .'\...........<br>  .................| . . . . . . . . ˉ¨¨¨¨ˉ,/ . . . .| .........<br>  .................| . . . . . . . , . . . .`'-, . . . |..........<br>  ................/\ . . . . . . ;-,,,-'~-~' . . .

He's Travaris Jackson.|`|94Ti4bHtaa	He would be taking all the carries away from Peterson because he doesn't know how to make quick decisions and throw the ball. So no|`|2VYjOqnpaa	The Vikings need to draft a good QB.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	NO ONE IS GOING TO SIGN VICK- PERIOD!!!|`|PC60YeBIaa	He's a terrible QB. For what reason does any one think he's any good?No one will sign him.|`|p4VcDjjpaa	The answer to the vikes qb problems is named Matt Cassel.  give up ur 1st rounder and get him. there really isnt anybody amazing that u can draft this year with the 20th whatever pick u have.   trade ur first round pick for Cassel draft a CB in the 2nd round and u will be good to blow away past the rest of the nfc|`|d44b17c6ab9967bce78b16440c87b6edaa	It would be a good fit him and all day in the backfield would be something else as long as he can stay out of trouble he should be fine and provide some competition with Jackson for the starting QB job the Vikings could win with this possibility|`|f9569dbe48e67b5bee545edfa81eec26aa	I think that Micheal Vick would fit in with any team.

392fb9fe3924e0ea502b517efe20098daa	I am not a physicist, but I would guess it is at peak shortly after it leaves your hand - not right out of the hand.  Sometime after leaving your hand, the energy from the force of your arm action will continue for a very brief period to gain maximum momentum thus maximum energy is not acheive until shortly after leaving the hand.  Then because there is no more force to propell the ball, it's speed starts to decrease.  Add gravity, time and distance to the equation, the ball looses velocity the further it travels.|`|wO56y9BYaa	The ball will reach its maximum velocity just as it's released by the pitcher.<br>  <br>  Think of it this way... as the pitcher winds up and throws, he's accelerating the ball. <br>  <br>  The instant the pitcher releases the ball, there is no longer any force being applied to accelerate it further.  From this point on air resistance and gravity both work to alter the direction and speed of the ball and the further the ball travels from the pitcher's hand, the slower it will go.|`|WeEjc79Uaa	It would reach its maximum velocity when you released the ball. Because of wind resistance and such... Hope i helped.

Y3KMLdjWaa	The bike came with a 100mm fork, a 130mm would be the max. I'd put on it without really messing up the steering. I would not put on a 150mm even it it was free, it will really upset the factory geometry.|`|AA10279646	Yes. You should have no problems. However, your steering my be slower because of the increased head tube angle. If this bothers you, try installing a lower, shorter stem to help compensate.<br>  <br>  Keep it in the big ring.
ai6ZGa21aa	you say its the driver but you should make sure properly first. 1st check the wheel does not move or knock sideways if it does this its your wheel bearings. if it does not. an only your dive is moving then it can only be two things. the locking ring for the cassette is loose or the cassette bearings are shot. if its loose get a shop to tighten it. its cheaper then buying the tool. i charge ￡3.00 for this or ￡5.99 for the cheapest tool make sure the shop don't rip you off. if its the cassette bearings then you need to replace the ( free hub body ) as you can not replace the bearings in these.witch will set you back about ￡15.99 -￡39.99 if its a bmx sealed bearing body + what ever they charge to fit it.|`|1jPiAkP4aa	The short answer, take the wheel to a shop. someone needs to actually see this to properly diagnose it. <br>  <br>  If it's really a cassette, what's probably happened is simply that the lock ring has come loose. Take the wheel to a bike shop and ask them to reattach the ring. You need a special tool for this, so it's better to have them do it, it should only take a minute.<br>  <br>  If the cassette is tight, but the wheel is actually loose, you may have a broken axle. In this case, the rear wheel mounts (known as 'dropouts') may spread, and allow the bearings to come out of the wheel. I'm basing this on the assumption that you do _not_ have a high end wheel with sealed bearings.<br>  <br>  If it is a broken axle, there is little that a person with no mechanic experience can do to fix it. It will take a new axle and new bearings, and they have to be assembled with the correct spacing on the axle ends and more importantly, the proper tension on the bearings (known as 'preload'). <br>  <br>  If it's just the lock ring it will take a minute to fix and they shouldn't charge more than a couple of bucks (unless they're real dicks about it and charge you the full hour of labor - don't let them do that). <br>  <br>  If it's a broken axle, you'll probably be better off getting a new wheel. It won't be much more expensive (for a 20" wheel) than having to pay the parts and labor for new bearings, new axle, assembly, plus you'll have a new rim as well.<br>  <br>  For a primer on repairing axles/wheels go to:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/cone-adjustment.html" rel="nofollow">http://sheldonbrown.com/cone-adjustment....</a>

oeQVK0cmaa	On February 12, 2009, reports surfaced that the Quebec athletic commission ("Régie des alcools, des courses et des jeux", or RACJ) request for a set of rule changes that differ from the Unified Rules of MMA has put the event at risk from taking place.[10] The current proposed rule changes are the disallowing of elbow and knee strikes, smaller cage, as well as stopping the fight when a fighter gets knocked down.[10][11] UFC Vice President of Regulatory Affairs Marc Ratner has stated that it is "too soon" to know how this new development would affect UFC 97. He did state that the UFC is aware of the issue and they are going to "make it work".[12]<br>  <br>  To date, the RACJ has followed the Unified Rules, but since laws differ by city, state, or province, a commission can insist on the usage of its own rules.[13]<br>  <br>  On February 18, 2009, it was announced that UFC officials were able to convince the RACJ that "the show must go on or it will be moved elsewhere."[14] Therefore, to the relief of the many who have already bought tickets, UFC 97 will remain in Montreal on April 18, 2009, as originally planned.|`|YN93QRdyaa	Basically it turns out that the laws in Montreal don't actually allow for MMA at all, officially they only sanction boxing, kickboxing and some kind of Pancrase-like 'mixed boxing' with no elbows or knees and an eight count for knockdowns. For the last few years the local athletic commission just turned a blind eye to MMA, but after the Strikebox debacle a new commissioner reviewed the laws and realized that MMA was technically illegal. <br>  <br>  As I understand it, it wasn't so much that they wanted to stop the UFC, it's just that the laws as they were didn't allow it. The UFC was apparently ready to move the show to Las Vegas if necessary but they were able to negotiate an appropriate set of rules with the local authorities. Apparently the only difference is that foot stomps will be illegal.<br>  <br>  In case you missed it, the Strikebox mess was a show which was basically advertised as MMA without the ground game, just striking. Yves Lavigne was the ref and he insisted he would only referee the fights as regular MMA (without any 'standup rules') so the promoter got all the fighters to agree to a 'gentleman's agreement' to not go to the ground. Which went fine until James Thompson in the main event took down his opponent and ground and pounded him. Which started a riot. Hence the local authorities wondering how the Hell an event like that was allowed go ahead, and looking at the laws again.|`|wKMCI1azaa	Just because discrepancies between sport rules regulators from the city and the UFC rules inside the octagon every country sport federation or organization have their rules for safety in the sport for protection of the fighters and city sport laws to get the license to promote the event.|`|ULw1777caa	They have different restrictions on what you can do in fights, but the UFC worked it out with them.|`|IRNvfdB9aa	There was a fight between the infamous Josh Thompson and some ex-hockey bruiser that was supposed to be weirdly ruled: they [promotion] wanted stand-up only, if it hit the ground, ref would immediately stand them up. Well, the athletic commission said there were no such rules in Quebec, and it would be MMA. Anyways, Thompson is approached and asked to keep it standing, but decides against it. The fans don't know, and show signs of potential riot once the fight hits the ground. The athletic commission starts getting nervous about the sport, and wants to change all rules. <br>  <br>  E

mLD6hy8naa	If the reason you are not starting tumbling now is because you don't have all three splits, you're wrong. You don't have to have all three splits to tumble, though it helps. I would reccommend starting tumbling as soon as possible. Jog, dance around the house, and do jumping jacks all the way through your favorite song to lose some fat you want to get rid of. Backhandprings; just try to go to tumbling classes more than once a week, and ask if there are any excercises you can do at home. My tumbling coach tells us to get into a bridge and do 2 sets of 5 bridge push ups every day. This will build muscle in your arms, tighten your core, and show you the position that you will be in when you do a backhandspring. Good luck!!!|`|5FbDXzr6aa	even if u dont have ur splits u can tumble<br>  actually tumbling they will have u work on all that stuff ull need for tryouts|`|bNydr1XJaa	yep u can if u have a trampoline practice cheer things like cartwheels, flips,  huheys, ecd. on it??? mabye  ;)

bgM8oUi4aa	I'm in your boat, mate! I avoided MMA deliberately as it was a 'mixed' martial art, but after a view bouts on tv... that's exactly the point! lol (Plus... Matt Hughs! Phenomenal strength and aggression!!)<br>  MMA takes A GREAT DEAL of its artform from wrestling, and submission holds, and the fighters are 'overall' more muscular, needing their weight to gain the advantage. <br>  Then, though, you have to remember that fighters cannot fight way above their weight class. So you'd have to judge a like-for-like weight category! That weight, on the boxer is ALL designed to land on a jaw, eye, or rib/kidney!<br>  The competition these days is too tight for anyone to give up more than 15lbs. It'd be a slaughter! lol<br>  I think that the best comparison you could make, and therefore, judge by, would be K1 Fighting! Again, any art goes, but it takes part in a ring, and the fighters are made to remain upright! Bushido, the Japanese form of wrestling is very similar to MMA only more rules concerning 'groundwork'.... If you haven't already seen these styles, take a look on Youtube... I think you'd really enjoy them!<br>  One thing that boxers do much more is running! (I would too... if an angry nutcase called Tyson wanted to EAT me, literally, alive! lmao) So they have a brilliant cardio-vascular fitness. And remember, the 12 round bouts that are modern boxing matches are very recent! There HAVE been fights known to have continued for days... during the bare-knuckle eras!<br>  Then again, could a boxer fight on the ground for 3 x 5mins rounds?<br>  <br>  I know you're asking about 'in better shape overall', but that leads to too many comparisons in 'who'd win if it came to a fight'?<br>  Otherwise the simple answer would be boxers for their stamina, and split-second sharp bursts of force in their punches, and upper body strength! <br>  <br>  But, if I'm right, and you are asking 'who'd win'? God help that boxer, if the MMA Fighter got past his initial barrage of punches, and guard! lol... I could see muscles and ligaments being torn on the boxer for 'fun'!! ;-)|`|M0qoqvJbaa	Most MMA fighters are in better shape for MMA than most boxers.  Most boxers are in better shape for boxing than most MMA fighters.  Boxing is more aerobic while MMA is more anaerobic.<br>  <br>  I've seen top level MMA pros who don't do any proper road work, they work for completely different types of muscular and cardiovascular endurance.  While a typical top level boxer would likely not last long enough to even get fatigued from groundwork in an MMA bout, I'm sure they'd be spent if they tried training in it for any length.  By contrast, if an MMA fighter made it into deep water in a boxing bout I could clearly picture a fighter flat on his heels, and arms totally exhausted if he even tried to keep up with the punch out put required to stay competitive in the early goings.<br>  <br>  Most MMA fighters don't have the speed boxing requires, and most boxers don't have the strength MMA requires.<br>  <br>  I believe, both in averages and in the highest of the high elite levels that boxers are better trained.  Boxing has a long history and training methodologies have been extremely refined.  I think the more we've seen MMA evolve, the more it's started to mirror boxing in all conventions:  presentation, terminology, rules, and of course training.  In all those fields though, I think MMA still has a bit of a way to go.|`|vEczORE3aa	It depends what boxers your talking about<br>  Boxers like Muhammed Ali and Mike Tyson were in much better shape and would they kill every MMA fighter easily, esspecialy Tyson in his younger days|`|ehfe97Zcaa	Not necessarily.

We did a 5 day backpacking trip there and did about 10 miles a day because we added some of the side trails. We started in the NW part of the trail and hiked counter-clockwise. The first day or so was pretty easy and we made good time. When we crossed back over Highway 44 we got into the really hard parts. Lots of ups and downs, but the trails were in good condition. Depending on when you plan to go might add to the challenge. We went in the middle of summer. It was hot, humid, and we had rain for two days almost constantly. The trails were muddy where they weren't rocky. If you do this in late spring or early fall, it might not be as bad. <br>  <br>  I'd get more specific, but my journals are boxed up and we did some backpacking on the Loyalsock Trail that same trip.

Yes, I understand the man can get on your nerves and trust me he gets on mines but he's on okay commentator when he's not trying to be funny! <br>  <br>  2. If it things he didn't do that people are complaining then I think that's more annoying. I can live with Gary, I have so far but complaining about something that hasn't happened is kinda annoying!<br>  <br>  3. I don't watch Versus because I'm in Canada .... but if people are complaining about having the channel and choosing no hockey over that then that's just annoying! So definitely the people who would rather have no hockey coverage!<br>  <br>  4. Don Cherry can get on my nerves...but sometimes I just have to agree with him so for this one it goes to the people who talk about his  clothes.<br>  <br>  5. Definitely the News Paper guy..... and Toronto just has so many of those suits!!! They really get me MADD.. like FRI* if your going to come to the game, watch it! At least the other fan is trying to learn!<br>  <br>  Nice Questions! :)|`|rv6zl5t3aa	1 & 2 have to be the people. I hate people, because most are just plain stupid. I have to deal with them on a daily basis, whether its driving into Boston with alot of idiots who can't drive or people who just have NO COMMON SENSE when it comes to anything.<br>  <br>  Can't say that I've ever really heard much of Pierre, but it sounds like I'm not missing a whole lot. We've got Jack Edwards and Brick, sometime that's enough. As for Bettman and Selig, I would have to agree that Selig has destroyed the game of baseball, along with Fehr, to a point where it has no creditiablty. Bettman may be a Douche' but he's no Selig.<br>  <br>  3. VS? Nothing wrong with it. Yeah their announcers are mostly the same guys you mentioned in #5(Talk alot of BS to make up for knowing nothing), but at least they DO show hockey and they did step up after the lockout to give us Hockey, which is alot better than POMPUS ESPN, who think their sh*t don't stink. Did ESPN really think that the NHL wouldn't be back and their would be no fans?? Dumba**es.<br>  <br>  4. I love Grapes. Always have and always will. Yeah he dresses like a Buffoon, but he's got company with Craig Sadler. At least Grapes doen't have players(KG) telling him to never wear a suit again and to just burn it!!<br>  <br>  5. The "know it all" is just a poser. I just let him be and just laugh at him, because aboot 90% of the people around him are thniking the same thing that I am, "this guy knows nothing". So who is he really trying to impress?? himself apparently. Every once in awhile there will be a really annoying guy and then I just correct everything he says and make him look like a fool. Sometimes thats fun. <br>  <br>  The guy on the phone is probably the worst though. I saw the comment "Your not that important" and I say that all the time, and actually to the guys face. Gets some great looks of stupidity and anger sometimes, but it's all worth it. Get off your Crackberry you tool!!!!<br>  <br>  *Layin Low- I thought the Fat Ones were called Puck Whales or Puck Buckets (more like Puke Buckets)...LOL|`|yHvh7tFlaa	1) People who complain about him, like Mike Milbury. Hope one day McGuire whaps him with a snow shovel.( Got my anti-Milbury rant out of the way early)<br>  <br>  2)Gary Bettman,,,for some of the things he HAS done, namely the shootout( It was still on his watch).<br>  <br>  3)People who complain about Versus. Rather have different teams than the EsPN/NBC mantra of the same teams each week.<br>  <br>  4)This season is my first exposure to him as an commentator, and I find him refreshing! Stop ragging on him about the jackets.<br>  <br>  5)How about fat Puck Bunnies that take up two seats each?  I had to change my seats last game because my son couldn't see over or past them. Yeah, the same game where the ref glared at me as he left the ice,lol.<br>  <br>  *I think SHE could take you in a fight!* (snicker,chortle, snort)|`|KdhNCnEjaa	I believe the answer would be 6, all of the above, but the guy on the cell phone annoys me the most, watch the friggin game if you bother to show up.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	1. Pierre IS pretty annoying.....being in the U.S you don't have to put up with him as much as us Canucks.....that said, I don't like CONSTANT complainers.<br>  <br>   2. Gary Bettman IS a pompous little puke but the complainers are also the uneducated, unknowledgable asshats. I laugh when I hear people complain about Bettman pertaining to things that aren't even really his jurisdiction....like discipline......people in the know understand that Colin Campbell is the punishment kingpin. Bud is only slightly worse IMO....I had them about even until the World Series.<br>  <br>   3. Versus bothers me not. Like you say....better than nil.<br>  <br>   4. Don Cherry DOES wear clownsuits......I could care less.....some of his opinions bother me (others I agree with)......Cherry is the biggest homer in the nation....you know how I feel about homers (even if the rah rah rah is usually for Canada).......hmm.....am I being part of the problem here? <br>  <br>   5. Hmmmmm....can I have an option where one of them is silent? I'll take that one.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	Anything that best suits the Montreal Canadiens fans.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	1) People who ***** about McGuire.  When he goes into gilding the lily mode...enough already.  When he's actually breaking down play...he's pretty good.  Try to seperate the two.  His work on during the WJC is almost always outstanding.<br>  2) People who ***** about Bettman, only because 99% of these people don't understand the structure in which he has to work, and don't get that ultimately, he's working for the BOG.<br>  3) The ESPN revisionists.  Who does ESPN have?  Barnaby and Melrose (not exactly the wondertwins of wisdom) and some guy with a bad wig/dye job who knows a lot less than he thinks he does?  And by the way...when you wonder why your cable rates keep going up, blame ESPN and their defacto extortionist policies.<br>  4) People who ***** about Grapes.  Look, I used to hate him, but if you actually listen to what he's saying...he's made some good points lately.  <br>  5) Reading paper...have fun.  At least you're not bothering anyone.  Guy with mobile phone; you're not that important.  So-called hockey smart guy...takes about 8 seconds to put them in their place.  Then, they shut up but then, hopped up on passive-aggressive pills, go into "well, we better ask the know-it-all elitist!" mode.|`|brd6l4MAaa	1. People who complain aboot McG are more annoying. Pierre might not come off as the sharpest knife in the drawer but neither are the majority of the populace. Networks see the need for the common folk to identify with announcers/commentators and he fits the bill <br>  <br>  2. People who complain aboot Bettman are more annoying. I might not always agree with his vision but I believe he's trying to do what's fiscally best for hockey. Selig on the other hand, is trying his best to leave 'his mark' on baseball. It's more aboot HIM than the game.<br>  <br>  3. People who complain aboot Versus. I used to live in an area that didn't have Versus coverage and I can tell you, watching the Playoffs via computer sucks big time. Better Vs than nothing<br>  <br>  4. People who complain aboot Cherry's wardrobe are more annoying. It's just a gimmick, part of his schtick. Get over it<br>  <br>  5. The newspaper/cell phone/texting guy. Give up your seat for someone who actually gives a damn<br>  <br>  If they were to lace 'em up today, I think Schultzie would still be able to knock Cote into next week|`|m6lDXAmoaa	Like Bob said, people in the US don't have to put up with him that much. I've only seen him the few times I get to actually watch hockey on NBC. But, I think he's more annoying than the people who complain about him...so long as they complain in moderation<br>  <br>  For all the crap Bettman has received, he actually has done some good things for the sport.And I get tired of people complaining about him incessantly <br>  <br>  Beggars can't be choosers. Luckily, most Wings games are on FSN so I don't have to put up with VS on a regular basis. Unfortunately, neither my dorm room or my home has VS so I have to settle for a night of binge drinking with my buddies at their apartment...woe is me hahaha<br>  <br>  I'll admit, whenever I hear Don Cherry I think immediately of his suits.Then again, due to him being shown primarily in Canada, I don't have a chance to really get a perspective on his commentary and analysis. So...people who talk about his jackets<br>  <br>  The one who talks constantly about how much he knows about the game...when he knows nothing.When I went to my first game ever back in December, my brother and I had about four of those guys sitting behind us jawing the whole damn time. I was ready to throw down and I don't get angry to easy|`|l5CKKXD3aa	1. Pierre, he is biased against every other team except the Penguins. (trust me, watch the replays of last years finals, you'll see what I'm talking about)<br>  <br>  2. Gary Bettman, hands down.<br>  <br>  3. Versus, they have terrible announcers and agani, are biased.<br>  <br>  4. People who talk about his kick *** jackets. They should listen to what he is saying instead of looking at his jacket.<br>  <br>  5. The guy who sits on his cell phone. I bet you could ask the guy who his favorite player on the team is, and he'll just say "LEAVE ME ALONE!". Trust me, I've seen it happen...|`|5UIsGjxCaa	1. Pierre used to coach the Hartford Whalers, need I say more.<br>  <br>  2. Batman looks like the count on Sesame Street, need I say more.<br>  <br>  3. Never seen a Hockey game on Versus. can't comment.<br>  <br>  4. Don Cherry is from Kingston, Ontario. We all dress like that here.<br>  <br>  5. Almost as bad as the guy by the blue line standing up, talking on his cell phone, and waving to his buddies back home or in Weggz watching the game.|`|IZ4GcYgiaa	1 Those who complain! They're others at NBC worth complaining about, Keith Olbermann!<br>  <br>  2. Same as one. Those. Who whine fail to understand that like all sports in the world, hockey has become a business.<br>  <br>  3. Same as one. Its called internet, center ice and sports bar.<br>  <br>  4. Same as one. Unlike Tony from PTI at least Don knows his hockey and represents his home country.<br>  <br>  5. Arenas and stadium that encourage other to use their phones at the games via text msg for votes and contests.|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	1. Pierre McGuire. You don't have to read the complaints :)<br>  <br>  2. Gary Bettman. I want Octapi-swinging back!<br>  <br>  3. People who would rather have no hockey coverage.<br>  <br>  4. Don Cherry.<br>  <br>  5. The latter. Give your ticket to someone who cares!|`|G33E41IBaa	1.) People who excessively complain about him.  He sucks, but if you don't like him THAT much, just turn off the TV.<br>  <br>  2.) Gary Bettman.  He may not be the worst, but I really think he could be doing a better job.<br>  <br>  3.) Versus of course.  And it's not always terrible.  Doc Emrick sometimes covers the games, and I think he's great.  If anything, I would rather watch a game and listen to bad announcers than not watch the game at all.  It's a good way for me to catch the games in the West.<br>  <br>  4.) People who talk about his jackets.  That's his thing, and it really won't change.<br>  <br>  5.) The guy who doesn't pay attention to the game.  Why would you even go if you're just reading or talking to someone else?  You're taking up a seat that a real fan - or someone who thinks hes a fan - would want to be in.|`|UoUaO52taa	1. McGuire is manageable. He's not great but I usually turn the TV down and listen to the radio if possible<br>  <br>  2. Bettman just because we lost the ESPN deal but tolarable<br>  <br>  3. Versus<br>  <br>  4. Don Cherry<br>  <br>  5. The guy on the cell is annoying if he's just load and standing<br>  <br>  <br>  Pretty cool about the Clement story. A few yrs ago I met Joe DeLammilure (Buffalo Bills HOF Guard) and he let me try on his Hall of Fame ring. Great guy|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	1. Pierre McGuire annoys the piss out of me. Enough said.<br>  2. I would take Bettman over Selig, being a huge fan of Baseball I think Selig needs to get his old head out of his old a-s-s. <br>  3. The only thing I dislike about Versus is McGuire.<br>  4. Don Cherry is entertaining, and I have never had any issues with him except for his hatred of the Russian Red Wings, but even then I didn't care much what the old man had to say<br>  5. Guy at the game (And I see this at all the games here in Detroit, i.e. Wings, Tigers, Lions) I really really really hate THAT GUY. Really. He needs to take his Blackberry and shove it in his a-s-s. Turn it into a Dingleberry.|`|naZQqrNeaa	1.)  I know hobos that could commentate better than Pierre McGuire....okay...I don't know any hobos, but he is (A) not funny and (B) not informative and (C) has an annoying voice and (D) is a homer.  I am going to say Pierre McGuire is WAY more annoying than people that complain about him.<br>  <br>  2.)  People that complain about Bettman are more annoying than Bettman.  No explanation needed.<br>  <br>  3.)  I would rather see hockey on Versus than on Fox with a glow puck. <br>  <br>  4.)  Hey, he wears those jackets so that people talk about them.....it is his choice.  That being said, I would say Cherry is more annoying in a purposeful type of way.   <br>  <br>  5.)  I would spill my drink on both of those people.....equally annoying.
Leoc8rlGaa	Michael Atherton. He batted for 643 minutes and faced 492 balls for England against South Africa at Johannesburg in 1995.

OfNTLq3Qaa	Even though I am an American I can understand why. The fact that some of the greatest wrestlers of all time were jobbed out at times just to please American fans. Now Bret Hart himself brought some of the heat by making comments about America, whether they were true at the time is another debate. However, I am as much of a Patriot of my country as anyone but I just never understood the point of having such one sided storylines. I am a fan of many wrestlers and many styles Most do not come from America, in fact only two or three are Americans. <br>  In short again I can understand why, the Hart Foundation was a great stable, misused by Vince, and misunderstood by American fans.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Well the 80s and early 90s version was just a tag team, while the 1997 version was a stable. I liked the stable better.|`|6LQNK51uaa	Storyline wise it was the worse but not worst of all time...to be honest I never liked the Patriotic version of wrestling storyline,it  always feels like that Americans hates every one who is not an American...like chanting USA during Kozlov's entrance...IDK what does it means.<br>  <br>  Sorry I was out of the question but I disagree with the Poll..Hart Foundation was one of the best Tag Team of all time.<br>  <br>  I think Stone Cold Sharkboy was the worst of all time.|`|17qBvONOaa	prejidice mother ****** hart foundation was the best tag team and they were the best wrestlers|`|kDAmNqt0aa	doink the clown or skinner.|`|OGPW7xZ2aa	eugene and the miz and morrison are wrost|`|KlGUrbYZaa	I find it very strange how anyone could think that the USA vs Canada storyline was the worst, I remember clearly feeling very excited about it at the time - even though I wasn't too keen on the segregation and racism it seemed to stir up.  <br>  <br>  From an outsider's point of view (being from the UK myself) and being at an impressionable age, it actually opened my eyes to the hatred the Americans appeared to have towards the Canadians and realised that maybe America wasn't the great place it made itself out to be (also, it seemed the Americans didn't like the Brits either - seeing as they'd boo Davey Boy out the building too).<br>  <br>  But, one of my favourite memories of the whole Attitude era (other than the Taker's Ministry) was when they broadcast an episode from Canada and the total role-reversal of the face/heel characters.  I vaguely remember there being a tag-team confrontation in which I don't think anyone expected the passion of the crowd.  <br>  <br>  I don't think I have seen a more buzzed up crowd than during that small portion of history.<br>  They say that wrestling isn't real - but people's emotions certainly were......<br>  <br>  As for worst storylines, I think they have happened after the whole attitude era came to a close and they started playing things safe (I admit that I haven't looked at the poll you refer to, so don't know what other choices there may have been), although to my mind, anything involved Festus I feel is in poor taste.|`|poc3xrCeaa	Right to Censor in WWE was Crap dont know what they were thinking with that and at the moment Vladamir Kozlov who cant wrestle i think is the worst thing wwe has ever put on TV.<br>  <br>  Hart Foundation Rulz|`|7uQxuQr2aa	i would say it is because canada simply did not like the storyline<br>  <br>  to everyone else it was fairly well recieved|`|AGMUa20Oaa	Hart Foundation was one of the best tag teams.

It doesn't matter what the chants are, but it's even crazier if the whole crowd is saying it at once...

YsSwe1Laaa	The repaired bones, especially with the plate, are probably the strongest ones in your body right now.  The damage to the tendons and ligaments in your ankle are another matter.  You should talk to a sport-medecine doc or physio about that.  Be thoughtful about things like ankle-wraps - if the forces on your leg are sufficiently great, overprotecting the ankle can translate the stress to the next weakest point, and you really don't want to trade an ankle sprain for damage to your knee.<br>  <br>  Your whole situation would be much easier to speak to if you cut weight.  Even 265 is a lot of mass at 6'2", and that total mass is resolved in part to local stress,especially on your legs as a forward.  But losing weight (in my experience) is a lot easier to do if you have an exercise program that you enjoy, and if that's playing rugby rather than boring old machines and road-work, then (a) get a physical exam and clearance by your physician, (b) find a club, (c) start training, and (d) have fun.<br>  <br>  Mark L.|`|NPFuyuKiaa	As long as it healed right, u shouldn't stop playing, but there is always a risk, you are still young you could still play even though suffering an injury
DFshzoJkaa	Bert... by early round KO.  Ernie doesnt have the ring experience and cant pack a punch.  Faced with Berts old school boxing knowledge and killer instinct, Ernie won't know what hit him and it'll be lights out.  However, if Ernie brought in Oscar the Grouch as his trainer, he could go the distance, but would lose on points.  With the proper training, Oscar the Grouch could get Ernie to fight with discipline, stay on his toes and box.... hoping Bert would fade in the later rounds.|`|74d926bbb467954124e827daf8495652aa	Ernie definitely and I'll tell you why. Being hispanic and from a long tradition of vicious bodypunchers, Ernie's Mexican heritage and ability to fight on the inside would allow him to close the distance against the taller and clueless Bert. If it went the distance, and it likely wouldn't, Ernie would win a comfortable decision. PS He isn't orange, he is brown and his last name is Rodriguez.  Look it up.|`|910875de6723862c69bd16bf9f5b2249aa	Ernie always frustrated Bert.  It would be like Tyson versus Holyfield.  Ernie is victorious.  Sorry to compare Bert to Tyson but the analogy works.|`|vFthoB6Haa	ernie!!! he's smaller but stockier and he'll knock bert out with a left hook! bernie will probably fight from the outside and use his reach, which is boring!|`|py0DpCh4aa	ernie<br>  big things come in small packages|`|Kg8OJnfmaa	which one is burt and which one is ernie. <br>  which ever one is the yellow guy would win because he has a lot of anger inside.  plus the yellow one hates the orange one and would Absolutely wreck the orange one.|`|exnm0wOtaa	Well according to VH1 Ernie is Puerto Rican and Bert is Dominican. So I would take Ernie being that Puerto Rico has a better boxing tradition.|`|AA10709426	Defiantly Ernie- nobody can beat that "rubber  ducky" technique!|`|120795afd4e1011681d5fd1a51b845a9aa	I think Bert would win. He has a longer reach and a temper to boot.|`|TO3Ojjr0aa	Ernie - He's got that low center of gravity.|`|AA11826034	ERNIE HANDS DOWN.|`|niCqMuRVaa	check this out:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=9A78DB26DC5D142B" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=...</a>|`|VELnLnIKaa	ernie he would fight dirty lol
GswnLKtQaa	Dwyane Wade.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	LeBron James is better player,dunker,passer,blocker,rebounder,b... defender and etc.<br>  Wade is a better scorer,shooter and stealer<br>  Plus he had a help from Shag<br>  LeBron James is better|`|KYaM65gzaa	HAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAH yeah ALL BY HIMSELF, NO HELP FROM TEH REFS! NONE WHATSOEVER! please wake up! surely we all know Stern didnt want to be handing that trophy to Cuban.search "phantom foul 2006 finals" in youtube youll see what im talking about. <br>  naivety in it purest form.<br>  all by himself heheheh what a joke|`|0ytjj1EGaa	LEBRON JAMES is better Than Wade<br>  <br>  Wade Had Some help from shaq though But He is also GREAT|`|P93I8CHtaa	its all about skills,i say lebron|`|e3de46afbf7ed625219f371a01158664aa	D-wade|`|YhfMrppSaa	Wade got title. Wade does not have power like Lebron.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Wade has title, Lebron will get a title<br>  <br>  <br>  Wade got defense, offense and he takes over a game like Lebron. Wade do it most of the time.<br>  <br>  <br>  Kobe has offense, and taking over, no tough defense.<br>  <br>  Cp3 has offense and taking over a game.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think Wade is better. He needs more power to get it done like King burger A K A Lebron James|`|HiuNSScLaa	he did have shaq but still wade think about it if you put wade on the cavs right now he is still an elite scorer they would be an even better team same with lakers if you put lebron on the heat there the same team if not worse soooooooo<br>  <br>  <br>  id take dwyane wade|`|7dd92fa9e1fedaa65abe9b3824b3fba3aa	Lebron<br>  <br>  P.S. DWADE did not win it all by himself. He had Shaquille O'Neal who is by far a better player than any teammate Lebron has ever had. he also had a better supporting cast than Lebron.|`|GBGcI509aa	Lebron James.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	LeBron James|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Wade had Shaq?|`|6440aca54e76133287a99d198c3d1a37aa	you're joking right?  James is by far the better player.|`|kjJkQpzPaa	Dwayne Wade<br>  Its a close choice, though|`|gM0pk41jaa	Dwade = def finitely a phenomenal player but lets get real. He's not better than LeBron simply cuz he won a ring and Lebron didn't win. Dwade had Shaq which was definitely a HUGE difference in the success of wade getting his ring and also wade had a better supporting cast. I mean Zydrunas Illgauskas and Shaq...come on now. And then notice how ever since Shaq left...the Heat aren't even a force in the league anymore and LeBrons team is among the best in the entire league right now and he still doesn't even have the best supporting cast So id have to say LeBron wins the comparison but no disrespect to dwade....hes still one of the best 2 guards in the league right now|`|JgAE7eV9aa	First of all for all ya FOOS D.Wade won that championship for shaq & everyone esle,he single handily SCORED almost half the heat's points in some of the cruicial games.Now on to the discussion, Lebron compare to dwade might not be subject because LJ is playing way better than he ever did.On the other hand we got somebody like DWade that you know you can trust unlike LJ choking in the NBA FINALS and waisting about 15hrs of my time(worst finals entertainement ever). I will have to go with Wade. LJ23 is nice but I dont trust him.especially in a NBA FINALS.|`|rTDJAtG3aa	Lebron James is the better player here. <br>  <br>  Dwayne Wade had Shaq. In no way was he by himself.<br>  <br>  Lebron took his team to the finals all by HIMSELF, but you have to have players around you to win. Which D-Wade had. <br>  <br>  PS. Lebron has a better repertoire|`|igCJpNLUaa	If wade won it by himself, I would like to see him play 1 on 5 against an nba a team to see if he would win a regular season game by himslef: basketball is about teamwork not selfishness. AND LBJ is better than wade period.|`|AOLo6OG1aa	LBJ of course. and Wade had Zo and Shaq. Every championship team needs a solid post presence. Look it up. all championship teams have had it.|`|ybk9VleOaa	LeBron James..<br>  He's still very young, improving day by day..<br>  He'll get his title someday..|`|EO3ZPlKxaa	Lebron he is leading his team to a top spot and he is way above the heat in standings check them out|`|1S2gUdN0aa	Lebron|`|D8a5Dqq3aa	Wade..Lebron James is up with him so a tie it is|`|DDQ8tCnpaa	LBJ by far, its not even close.|`|O3tUgZ7naa	Wade <br>  Lebron's a show off|`|GjJmNOg1aa	Dwade!!
XU1KaWXwaa	i would be very happy if just man utd went out. theyve been having it too good for too long.|`|bqvOOUwDaa	I always back the English teams to go through when they are playing a team from another country of course, but when Arsenal are playing against one of the other teams from our Country, then it's Arsenal all the way.<br>  <br>  I'm hoping at some stage it will be Arsenal v Liverpool again, but unlike last season, Arsenal will win!!|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	Manchester united will win this year champions league<br>  chelsea,arsenal,and liverpool i think they will out from champions league|`|FFE9Qztzaa	I wanted all English clubs to pass on to THIS stage.

I'm a Man United fan. However, I don't want them all to go through as I think it'll be more interesting that way as it seems that the only real contenders for the Champions League are the four english teams and Barcelona.|`|skgN9TJLaa	I don't support any premiership club, but do have a soft spot for Liverpool having worked there a few years back but I would want all the english teams to do well not just in the champions league but the UEFA Cup as well.|`|nGpBuI9Oaa	Let it be an all english semi-final and then arsenal win it!!<br>  <br>  DIABY is fit for tommorow, that is one good news!<br>  <br>  Arsenal 2-0 Roma|`|7x4VtGtFaa	I can live with all four English clubs going through the next round.

Hahaha.|`|1611a17a4b0cd6610c45b73de16234bcaa	man united fan here<br>  <br>  i dont mind the english teams go thru cos it'll be easier to play against them later on(cos play against them so many times, easier to predict their game plan and strategy)...on the other hand, i dont mind the other teams goin thru then we will get a challenging game later on...(different teams,  different style of playing)|`|KYiboT8uaa	liverpool will win this year and yes you are so right inter will catch united ha ha,united fans are so sure of themselves ye will get a smack back to reality when liverpool beat ye again in march :)|`|O5KOwhovaa	I'm a Liverpool supporter.<br>  <br>  I'd prefer all three English teams plus Barcelona to be eliminated.|`|yJnoOZDyaa	Man Utd OUT<br>  <br>  The rest i don't care about...|`|Maja0Gzdaa	I want all of them to get to the semie-finals (If that's possible), and then thats surely proves that the EPL is the best league in the world...|`|RSJbqioUaa	I want Arsenal and Liverpool to go through.<br>  But I'd be happy if Man U get knocked out....after last year's final you can understand me being bitter right?

cOPCNP7Laa	You could say the more they go in the CL the more they will be busy to bother abt the League.

He sold (Michael) Essien for 38million euros, (Mahamadou) Diarra for 26million euros, (Florent) Malouda for 19million euros, (Eric) Abidal for 16million euros. And I congratulate him for that.<br>  <br>  "When we played Lyon last season, at the end of the match, he said, 'Chelsea are making me an offer of 50million euros for Benzema'.

ja6ZJvVWaa	The earliest known reference to Baseball is in a 1744 British publication, "A Little Pretty Pocket-Book" by John Newbery. It contains a rhymed description of "base-ball" and a wood-cut illustration showing a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases.English lawyer William Bray recorded a game of "baseball" on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey; Bray's diary was verified as authentic in September 2008.<br>           Whereas Cricket has been around for much longer. Despite many prior suggested references, the first definite reference to the game is found in a 1598 court case concerning dispute over a school's ownership of a plot of land. A 59-year old coroner, John Derrick, testified that he and his school friends had played cricket on the site fifty years earlier. <br>       Prior to the evidence I have given, I believe Cricket is, without a fact, older than Baseball.|`|60uWyEKtaa	Hard to say Evan, the Americans had a league as far back as 1853. With the first official game being played in 1846. However historians believe that both games evolved independently from similar roots in different English counties. Crickets first official test match was in 1876, operating under the laws of the MCC, so it can be argued that Baseball as a codified sport is older....<br>  <br>  We all know the truth though don't we...<br>  <br>  Edit: Definitely Cricket then, In 1598 they were playing it as Crekkett, lol.|`|GdJTQX6raa	it is cricket not the modern one or ODI but Test cricket which lasted even for 11 days. those were the days when the cricket started as early as 1700 onwards.

His moves are powerful and put the hurt on the hurt on his opponents.  But as I stated, his moves are limited. <br>  <br>  Randy Orton's moveset though is much more precise and is more meant towards working on an opponent.  To me he doesnt appear to use much energy to defeat opponents, he uses high impact moves but expends as little energy as possible.  He makes well thought out moves and has a much larger arsenal of moves at his disposal.|`|7ImGw976aa	I'm not over fond of either at the moment, especially always don't like Cena.<br>  I'd pick Orton, he's purely a better wrestler than Cena and has been more able to go face AND heel. Where as Cena is very boring and repetitive, can't wrestle and his gimmick is really annoying and feels like it never progress's. The only reason Cena's had more titles and things is because the children like him the most at the moment.|`|VHybyedbaa	orton is a better wrestler,but cena has the strength.in an amatuer match i would say cena would win because he is still a talanted wrestler with the extra power.|`|AA12142131	randy is awesome cuz he took out hhh shane and vince mcCmahon, and dibase.All with the punt.|`|y7tdGmOUaa	to me cena the best

From 1989 to 2000, so yes I would agree that in the 90's he was the best player in baseball. Sadly, injuries did him in after that, and he's never been able to recover. Still, for a man to put up over 600 home runs during a career that has been plagued by injuries is impressive in and of itself. For the last 8 years, he's never been healthy and he's still put together a Hall of Fame worthy career. Just think what he could have done healthy.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Second or third.|`|AA11720887	He is among the best but he played at the same time as Cal Ripken Jr. and I think Cal was the best.

Junior Griffey is a sure Hall of Fame candidate. Enough said.|`|XuGFt3boaa	He was the best, maybe the greatest baseball player in the 90's.  He could, throw, hit, and field.

Having two Americans in the same team would not bode well for car and program development as Julian mentioned. There needs to be an experienced hand involved in this new team driver wise. <br>  <br>  Button or Barichello would work for me. Coulthard would be a great option too.

65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	You should do some base training if you're planning on competing at any distance.  Base training gets your body accustomed to athletic training more gradually than jumping right into a program, reducing the risk of injury.  It also gives you some conditioning background, allowing you to go harder when you do start your program and make the most of it.<br>  <br>  The amount of base training you need depends on your event and the difficulty of your early workouts.

Manny thinks he is the best player in the league when he is not. He had great numbers for the Dodgers but he is not the best all around player. He will only bring chaos wherever he goes. He cannot behave for more than a year, that is why the Dodgers won't sign him. He needs to get over himself and hope that somebody signs him. <br>  I will cheer for the Dodgers if they don't sign him and he has to sit out for a season or take less money for a one year deal.|`|P1bO87l1aa	Manny and his agent Scott Boras are just greedy ***holes.  I would only give him a 1 year contract at the minimum salary that would have incentives if he played the whole season and based on his production. Take a look at the economy.  Many people who would go to games can't afford it anymore.  Attendance is going to be way down this years and some owners will end up losing big bucks because of the hugh salaries they are burdened with.|`|AA11720887	It's kind of silly to call the Dodgers cheap when they are willing to pay Manny more than any other team. He does was too much and too long. He has been a great hitter. He is worth more to LA than to anyone else. But he may only have 2 good years left and he wants to be paid for 4. The Dodgers are being more than fair and he can go out playing for a winning team.|`|CshFQShGaa	The Dodgers are more worried about him "being Manny" than they are about his production. He's a sub-par defender with a great bat, but he'll be 37 this year, so it's a huge risk to sign him to anything longer than 2 years. There are 2 Mannys- the happy one the Dodgers saw in the 2nd half of the season, and the disgruntled one the Red Sox saw in the 1st half. They're worried that the happy Manny could turn into the disgruntled Manny at any time if something happens to set him off. He is coming out of an 8 year, $160m contract- if he wanted a really big contract, he would have signed a 5 or 6 year deal 8 years ago, instead of the 8 year (with 2 option years at $20m apiece!) deal that he signed. If he had been a free agent at the end of 2006 instead of 2008, he probably would have gotten a 5 year, $100m+ deal. Now, he's a couple of years too old to expect 3-4 years or more. He's comparing himself to A-Rod's current 10-year, $275m deal that will pay him until he's 42.|`|Kw3dWcptaa	manny wants more money than hes worth and he cant seem to figure it out, all he has is a power bat which can only hit at most 30, he needs to start thinking about why they dont want to sign him for that much, if he was really worth it they would have already.|`|9d5001a56ba031ba48358cae82b85660aa	As long as he doesn't sign back with Boston, I could care less about him!|`|C3VwhIIAaa	Ii will boycott if they sign Manny.

NR5LhOpPaa	It all depends on how much you play and how often you break your strings.<br>  <br>  If you play a lot, it's a good idea to have a backup, so that you aren't stuck without a racquet while yours is being restrung.  And if you break strings frequently (when I was playing a lot, mine were lasting two weeks at best), you should definitely have a backup.  <br>  <br>  However, if you aren't playing in tournaments every weekend or string breaking hasn't been an issue for you yet, don't worry about it.  It would just be a waste of money.  I mean, by the time that you are breaking strings constantly, you might have upgraded to another frame.<br>  <br>  My final thought: If you do buy another one, get an identical frame, and string both at the same tension.  This will make the transition between racquets much more seamless.  I've had three different frames in my bag before, and it's not a good situation.  Especially when you break a string in the middle of a match and have to adjust to a different frame mid-match.|`|bc998ecd84fbc0adf3d9154f2683ff7daa	Why not it worked for you last time, see your tennis coach for advice, he might suggest tightening the strings etc for more zip|`|x5N1PO4haa	Get 2 different ones!!|`|9nU2i8pdaa	Get 2 diffrents because its boring having 2 the same|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	yeah its good to have tow racquets... in case one breaks.. or if u want to try the different varieties...

I think if Bischoff/Hogan does open a wrestling promotion I think he'll do a better job since he's more older.|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	Vince McMahon who own wrestling right now it vince that the fact!|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	I'm pretty torn with my answer, it's between Bischoff and Heyman. I think i am going with Heyman, with limited funds and star power he created a ground breaking company which was the first for many things like Lucha Libre and gave smaller technical wrestlers a place to shine. Nearly everything done in ECW in the 90's was original and innovative, was the birth place of many stars that carried the other two company's in the monday night wars.|`|UI79JnJVaa	"Jim Cornett.

TL1Jkqunaa	You should only use "soft" materials for loafing.  That means things that are softer then the metal of the shotgun barrel.  Most guns use good steel, fairly hard.  You can test any material by trying to scratch the barrel (on the outside) with whatever you are thinking to use to reload.  If it can scratch the barrel at all do not use it in your shells.<br>  <br>  Lead and copper are fine, they are very soft compared to the barrel.   Rock salt and dimes (copper and silver) are also fine, being soft malleable metals.  Steel is not fine, it will scratch your barrel easily.  Some glass may scratch the barrel, so do not use it without scratch testing first.<br>  <br>  Copper shot is recommended for some uses.  But since it is not as dense  as lead it will not carry as far or hit with as much impact.  Use it when you know you will be close to the target.<br>  <br>  Be smart choosing what you use to reload, you want the softest densest material you can find, generally.  <br>  <br>  (P.S.  I've been shot with rock salt- a result of pumpkin stealing.  Seems to work fine, a good teacher's aid.)|`|AA10232540	Yes, you can.  Dougger is right about it scratching barrels, but that's really only applicable to older guns.  Today's barrels aren't as picky as they once were.  Your Pardner is a modern weapon and should be rated for steel, but the old Crescent, stick to lead.  You'd have no safety probs without a choke....it's just that I like old Crescents and dammit, use lead!<br>  <br>  Steel's a lot less dense than lead so you'll need to get more room in the hull to hold the same weight of steel.  You can find your own powder measurement in whichever reloading manual you use to suit your load of lead and then convert it to steel by replacing the buffer/shotcup wad to fit the hull.  Steel will always take a shorter buffer/long shot cup wad and then use a couple of overshot cards or cork of the appropriate thickness to fill the hull for a good crimp.  As long as you stay at the proper steel weight for the same weight of lead, you're ok.  Some folks go so far as to tie their steel into a little mylar baggie in the shotcup so it stays put til it leaves the barrel....I've never really seen the need.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	IF AND ONLY IF you use steel shot reloading info when reloading including the correct wads it should be fine. As a precaution I would stay a few tenths of a grain below the listed max load of powder.<br>  <br>  Sure you don't have a cousin, nephew or niece that has a BB gun and would appreciate them?

Compared to other NBA All-Stars before they reached their 21st birthday, Durant’s career is off to a much better start than most, the reason many believe he will be one of the league’s premier scorers for years to come.<br>  <br>  Kevin is just stuck with a losing team, a more improved Oklahoma Thunder will make him an All-Star.<br>  <br>  Similar to a golfer who shoots his age, it’s rare when an NBA player’s career scoring average is higher than his age. <br>  <br>  “I could be doing a lot better. I could be doing a lot more to help my chances,” Durant said. “I’m the type of guy that if I’m working hard I like to see the benefits. I know that may not happen but if I continue to work hard hopefully I can be an All-Star before my career is over.”<br>  <br>  =]|`|gM0pk41jaa	Its simple. The fans get to vote the starting 5...and if you notice....its almost the same people every year. It could be Tim Duncans worst year and ill bet the fans will still vote him as the starting power forward for the west for the rest of his career. But the rest of the all-star reserves on the west team came from winning teams and even tho kevin durant is playing like an all-star himself...his team isn't(have u seen their record) so therefore all the coaches in the nba who get to pick the reserves simply overlooked him cuz of his teams non-success. Also its only his 2nd season in the NBA and most players don't even make it until after their third or fourth season. <br>  <br>  Lebron and Dwade are few exceptions as they made it their 2nd season<br>  <br>  but Dwight Howard and Chris Paul made their first appearance their 3rd seasons respectively and i think the same will happen for Durant. We will definitely see him in there next year|`|cR4W88GYaa	It's becuase the NBA has the worst all star voting ever. It's all fan votes. Yao Ming and Shaq have gotten in before with playing only like 4 games. The only reason he didn't get in is because most of the NBA fans know nothing about the Thunder because they aren't any good and so they don't hear about him.|`|C7stvMqxaa	I am going to have to agree with Witness.<br>  <br>  One of my favorite teams and oneof my favorite players.<br>  <br>  Just say the Thunder were in a playoff race, he would be a backup for a forward.|`|DDQ8tCnpaa	i guess cuz him team suk, but wade gets in every year and his team is really bad especially last year. so, idk but he should have been in.|`|AOLo6OG1aa	yeah i know he gets no love. its b/c he plays for a crappy team and gets no media coverage. all the press wanna talk about is celtics/lakers/cavs.|`|UOqWNXeHaa	i agree|`|21J0IIZbaa	Durant should of made the All-Star for David West.|`|AA11488609	Because his team is horrible and the west is stacked.  Kevin Martin of the Kings is another player who is in Durant's situation.  Great scorer, but no All Star love, and definitely little recognition beyond Sacramento.  He is definitely one of the NBA's more underrated players.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Well because of his team's record and because he's only 20.He can be one of the best scores in the nba in the years to come but improved OKC will make him an all star|`|6chLhNJhaa	Durant said he doesnt deserve to be an allstar....His team isnt winning. That why caron butler or antawn jamison didnt make the allstar team.<br>  <br>  PS: You need to take some english classes...you type like a retard|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Because His team is Bad <br>  <br>  And coaches dont take players from bad Teams<br>  <br>  PROOF: No Durant And No Al Jefferson in All Star|`|NzkPEKYgaa	Not All stats. The Thunder don't have a winning record.
vJyF8siJaa	In terms of entertainment, yes...kobe's very fun to watch.<br>  <br>  In productivity, yes, both are productive players.<br>  <br>  Sportsmanship, tied.<br>  <br>  In keeping the NBA alive, ofcourse kobe's the face of basketball now.<br>  <br>  In clutch, yes because kobe's also a clutch player. but not as much as MJ<br>  <br>  <br>  In dribbling and shooting, kobe's a better ball handler and shooter than MJ, even phil jackson said that.<br>  <br>  as one of the best, yes.|`|GswnLKtQaa	the comparison won't stop because both players almost have the same style.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	I agree with you and the fact i don't like Kobe doesn't mean i hate him and to talk sh!t about him.He's a great player and deserves to be one of the greatest player in the nba|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	I think so because they both have that "extra" gear that separates them from other allstar players. Jordan could always go to the next level unlike reggie,clyde,wilkins and malone. kobe does teh same thing with AI,Lebron,etc. <br>  <br>  they are both the prime players for the league during their era.|`|YhfMrppSaa	Enough of Kobe. Kobe dont play defense. Lebron has all, and defense|`|0ytjj1EGaa	U R RIGHT in everything except shooting and clutch (MJ is better but still comparable)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Kobe is the best now  he has the responsibility to Keep The NBA ALIVE|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	No, not at all. But unfortunately a whole slew of idiots will continue to do so until the end of eternity.|`|oMSTg5rQaa	In terms of entertainment I think Kobe is enertaining, in a Jerry Springer type way sometimes, which is still good.MJ on the other was purely entertainment ON THE COURT, no drama off of it, none that was reported anyway.<br>  <br>  In terms of productvity Kobe just doesn't stack up. Just check the stats. Michael Jordan was the most productive shooting guard of all-time. Kobe is a distant second. <br>  <br>  MJ and Kobe could both be ***holes. Kobe's dark side was just more public.<br>  <br>  In keeping the NBA alive, you can thank MJ for doing so after Bird and Magic and Kobe and Shaq for doing their thing to keep the game interesting after MJ left. Shaq and Kobe won big and had big drama, Kobe post Shaq has been a great one man show and now is about to (most likely) become a champion.<br>  <br>  Clutch Comparison, Kobe is right there, but he can be alittle selfish with the game on the line, but still has made some spectacular shots. MJ though still holds the best clutch moment in NBA history. Against the Jazz in 1998 he drove in for a layup to bring them within 1, got the steal and sank a jumper to win his last NBA title. <br>  <br>  Dribbling and Shooting - Jordan believe it not is heads and shoulders above Kobe. Why? Shot selection and the ability to make tough shots. MJ could change his JUMP SHOT in mid-air, and make a respectable percentage. Kobe on the other hand struggles with his shot when he is under intense pressure. Jordan also uses the dribble more efficiently. He uses less dribbles to get where he wants or to get a shot off. Kobe over dribbles and gets himself into trouble.<br>  <br>  And yes I agree, they are both two of the best shooting guards of all-time. Jordan being thee best.|`|gM0pk41jaa	Personally i Think Kobe Bryant is BETTER than MJ...and no im not on crack...im in my right mind when i say this. Both are probably the greatest players to ever play the game but Kobe has been changing the game of basketball since he was a teenager and individually i just think his game is more complete and unstoppable in  his prime right now then Michael Jordan's even during his prime. I think many people jus ride on MJ's boat cuz of what they hear and his household name but i've actually watched both of them play so i know what im talking about and most of these other jokers just go by the sayings. Now Michael does have 6 rings and Kobes been stuck on 3 for the longest but you got to remember...were talking from an individual standpoint.|`|GjJmNOg1aa	no because kobe doesn't have as much achievements as mj and mj actually got his team mates heads into the game but kobe just cares about his stats.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	I will agree that Jordan managed his image a whole lot better then Kobe has.  Jordan has a bunch of warts, it's just that nobody seems to care.|`|La5lmN9eaa	Kobe is a MJ wanna be. Plain and simple MJ was a player that comes once in a life time.|`|9ymzwJwqaa	answer this, who else would you be able to compare Kobe to if not the greatest?

QC2NozBkaa	True blueing is actually a rusting process.  It is used to protect the metal.  Old time blacksmiths and metal workers would repeatedly scrape the rust off of iron and steel products until they noticed that eventually a hard brown finish was achieved that resisted rusting.  They would then intentionally encourage this rust/remove/rust process to promote this finish.  Later they discovered that if heat was applied during this process they got a pleasing blue/black finish.  Special salt formulas where made to promote rich colors.  Modern blueing can be achieve through traditional means or chemical processes.|`|AA11570394	Long ago they didn’t blue guns at all, they were left in the white and after time developed a patina color.<br>  Bluing is about .0001 thick and was originally applied to reduce the suns reflection on the barrel that would hinder the shooters ability to see his sights clearly. <br>  <br>  As long as you keep a light coat of gun oil on a firearm it will not rust; bluing or not. I have a few old guns that have little bluing left on them and they work fine.<br>  <br>  What I would be concerned about it the heat from the fire compromising the metals strength. If the fire did not get hot enough to burn the stocks then they are ok. But if the fire got hot enough to burn a wood stock then you may have a dangerous situation with that firearm and a gun smith should examine it.<br>  <br>  Note that wood will burn at a much lower temperature than is needed to compromise the steel of a gun. 800 degrees will toast a wood stock but will not harm the steel on most guns but get above that and then you’re in the danger areas. Remember they do solder sights on some barrels at temperatures that would burn wood.<br>  But again this is where a gun smith comes in to make the call.|`|4SF4KGu4aa	Steven A is the only one that his it dead on. Bluing is "pre-rusting" but controlled rusting. It actually hardens the metal surface to a degree. It also cuts down on the light reflection. Browning is just another similar process.<br>  <br>  You can take a carbon steel "old time" butcher knife and blue it simple by slice through a lemon and then and apple several times. Don't wipe the blade off and you'll see it darken some the next day. That's why those old sharp butcher knives always have a black looking blade. Rust from use but controlled rusting.|`|J9bqxogLaa	Bluing is to protect the rifle from rust and to make it look better. If you are vigilant and keep the guns well oiled and don't mind what they look like then they don't have to be blued.<br>  <br>  I recommend Oxpho-blue from Brownell's. Go to  <a href="http://www.brownells.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.brownells.com/</a>  and search for it. It is simple to use and is a very durable finish that you can do yourself. Just wipe it on and buff it. No prep before hand. Sounds too good to be true but it works great. I use the cream version. Sorry to hear about the fire.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	Blueing is "just something to fight rust", but rust is the worst enemy of a firearm.  Therefore, you do HAVE to get them redone, or redo them yourself.  It's fairly easy.|`|nBUDjyhgaa	Bluing is simply a finish, like a coat of paint.Several of my older guns have lost 95% of the bluing,leaving the steel a nice shade of brown.It won't hurt anything to leave them as they are.Done right, bluing is a long, expensive process.Personaly,I'd leave them as they are.

Though I'm not for cheating, whether it's one-sided or two-sided, if someone is cheating against and IF you feel the need to cheat back, then don't resort to biting an ear.

Y31Ci8vlaa	In usa more people spend for golf and it is more worthy than fishing.|`|GQfasfjiaa	Greg<br>  <br>  I have to think it is probably golf.<br>  <br>  However approx 44 million people fish.  Now they might fish weekly or only once in a lifetime, who knows how they come up with these numbers, although almost every state requires fishers to have a license.<br>  <br>  As for spending money, Golfers probably spend more because they need to buy clubs, clothing, lessons, memberships, green fees etc.  Fishermen need just a rod and reel plus some bait to get started.  However the costs change if they buy a big boat to go fishing !|`|GXo3Naosaa	golf.  it's not even close, really.  there are so many courses out there and each probably has about 200-300 a day come through... a lot of people fish, but not as many as golf.  sorry, your buddy is right and you're wrong...

4gZ8FUsoaa	Football is the best sport in the world....and always will be! Just look at how many people play it, watch it and follow their local teams. The world cup generates so much popularity and unites people world wide.......read the facts in any good book about football. Plus it involves skill and fitness that's why ( Soccer Players ) people are paid such high rates to play professional.<br>  <br>  The Best Soccer Teams in the World Are ( My Opinion ) : <br>  <br>  1 - Barcelona <br>  2- Man Utd.<br>  3- Real Madrid <br>  4- Bayern Munich<br>  5- Inter Milan<br>  6- AC Milan <br>  7- Lyon<br>  8- Chelsea<br>  9- Liverpool<br>  10- Arsenal|`|IWM1khX7aa	Soccer (football for the rest of the world) is the best sport in the world and it will always be!  Everyone plays it.  <br>  <br>  Soccer players are probably one of the most athletic people in the world.  They are fast, skillful, have a lot of endurance, strong, intelligent and coordinated.  No other team sport compares to how hard it is (Boxing is the hardest individual sport).  It also requires more team chemistry with the players, unlike baseball, where a pitcher and a designated hitter are never on the field with each other.<br>  <br>  I think Barcelona is the best team in the world.  They have the best center midfielder (Xavi), the best striker (Eto'o) and the best player (Messi) in the world.  They also have a strong defense (Dani Alves and Puyol), another great center midfielder (Iniesta) and a legendary striker (Thierry Henry).  Manchester United comes in a close second.|`|baj33W9Yaa	Football is awesome because it's like an international language by itself. Every fan speaks it and it doesn't matter how old you are, as long as you support a team, be it Liverpool or Arsenal, you instantly connect well.<br>  <br>  AND, it's so exciting because you never know what would happen and the top clubs can fall from grace any time!|`|GKZwHkyPaa	^^wow, so deep, uve rossa seems to be crazy about footie! i love it too, but not soo much|`|c4GykfVkaa	Footie is the best sport in the entire world. In my country everyone plays it and everyone watches leagues of european countries as we don't have strong teams. so i grew up surrounded by football. Those who live in England or Spain can Attend games every weekend and see the best teams or and best players of the world, but for me it is like a blessing, so when i attended a Serie A match(roma-ac milan) in Rome, It was like going to heaven! And most people don't understand this. The best thing about football is that is unites people all around the world. If you support a team, the other supporters, even unknown people become so close and warm for you. So, this is the best sport in the world, i live by football, from weekend to weekend, from 1/8 finals to 1/4 finals. This Sport Is My Life.

SjTAVdcKaa	Actually, yes. Coupled with proper diet & cardio of about 20-30 minutes a day, 3,4 times a week, yes.<br>  <br>  But you still need 30-40 minutes 4 or 5 times a week. If you dont have 10 minutes for a fitness dvd dont think you can get away with swinging a 5 pound dumbbell 2 or 3 times. It takes effort.|`|gdaimMuoaa	no weight lifting is for muscle gain and you gain more weight, but cardio vascular is for losing weight so if you want to lose weight then do cardio vascular and if you want to gain muscle and gain weight the you can weight lift|`|3iJ6CmAjaa	It depends exactly what you mean by weight loss. If you want to weigh less then no as the weightlifting would add muscle gain and this would add to you weight. However, if you mean you want to get skinnier, then yes, weightlifting can help to get rid of unwanted fat. Hope this helped.|`|M0qoqvJbaa	For many people it is, weight lifting still burns calories and building and maintaining muscle does even more so.  However it's ideal when coupled with intense cardiovascular exercise.  If you think proper weight lifting and muscle gains can be made any easier than cardiovascular exercise however you're sorely mistaken.<br>  <br>  If you're pressed for time, try sprinting, that's running as fast as you can for a very short while, like 30 seconds.  Catch your heath, for say a minute, and repeat this process a few times.  You won't need more than a few minutes a day or any special equipment though I recommend you find a relatively soft surface and have some running shoes.<br>  <br>  It's a very simple concept but by no means easy or remotely fun.  You're putting great stress on the largest muscle groups in your body and building those while getting your heart rate up and keeping it up.  I want to reemphasize where I said "as fast as you can", you can't maintain a steady jog, that won't increase your heart rate, and it won't put strain on the muscles.  It's all about the effort you put into it.<br>  <br>  And having said all of that, the most important part of weight loss is diet.  If you aren't burning more calories than you're taking in then you can't lose weight.  If you're burning more calories than you're taking in, you can't gain weight.  Again a simple concept in theory that is neither easy nor fun in actual practice.  If you want to be healthier, cut out all processed foods and drink only water.  Drink lots of water.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

ocPlxCIeaa	On first 4 days of a test match, 90 overs have to be bowled, and on the last day, 70 overs in first 5 hours, and then 20 mandatory overs in the last hour of play. <br>  If there is no chance of a result, play can be called off with both captains' consent after 30 minutes into the mandatory hour (or after 8 overs have been bowled). This guarantees a minimum of 5 1/2 hours of play on the final day (weather permitting, of course) even when there is absolutely no hope for a result.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cheers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11088802	must do or Bowl overs|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	90 overs in day|`|cWuumdy7aa	Today we have a rule to bowl 90 overs a day and if there is problem of over rate then the bowling side taking more time is punished. but before this rule came in to force the play in each days was restricted by time of 6 hours irrespective of the number of overs and in that condition it was mandatory that on 5th day of the test match last one hour the fielding side was supposed to bowl 20 overs or the play was extended till20 overs were bowled. now this is replaced by 90 overs per day.|`|5wAAnZPYaa	It is the number of overs that the fielding side has bowl subject to certain conditions like light,climate etc.But if they fail it can be denied.|`|cLlAEhb8aa	mandatory over in test cricket is that the bowling side must bowl 90 overs in a day.

MHm5lRcWaa	First another question.  How are you getting the boat out of the water?  Will you be having it hauled out by a crane onto a cradle or floating the boat onto a cradle on a trailer at a deep water ramp?  The reason for the question is that if your having it hauled by a crane they can easily remove the mast before hauling the boat.  At any rate what you need to do is to first remove and store the boom.  You'll also want to tie up all the rigging and wiring onto the mast.  Then you need to release all of the the shrouds and lift the mast clear.  I'm not really familiar with the Cal 25, but because you've asked the question I'll assume the mast's step is on the floor inside the cabin.  That means you need to lift the mast straight all the way up through the hole in the top of the cabin before you can lay it down.  If the mast step is on the top of the cabin the task is a lot easier.  I've done it in the past by hand.  You need to find a dock with pilings and a bulkhead at low tide.  That way you can tie a line around the top of the mast and have people on the top of the bulkhead to support the mast when you remove all of the shrouds.<br>  If you can afford to have the boat hauled by professionals with a hoist the first few times it will definitely be a lot safer for both the boat and you.

You may know that he did but unless you have a photograph of him signing the poster then it may not get as much as you would like.  <br>  There are so many sites that officially sell stuff like what you have that you just need to do a little research to see what it is worth.  But at a guess I would say around $100 may be the best you would do, but again you need to have proof that he signed it.|`|dcDRHNDQaa	like $50 - $60 bucks man idk sumthin like that
QT6iRQNaaa	To be on the safe side you should inquire in the Price Check forums on RarityGuide.com <br>  <br>  Many collectors hang out there and might be able to tell you how much that poster is worth.|`|TGuyq4sGaa	I would say not more than 100 not less than 20.<br>  <br>  He is a great dirtbiker/freestle/rally racer..Grr anything with dirt?<br>  But he does sign alot of stuff i mean if you just see him around at a freestyle competition he will sign it he is young and a chill guy.

EHtFxGxMaa	The races are based on a DISTANCE. IF you are going around the track, even under caution, you are still putting DISTANCE on the car.|`|jLvlcoFBaa	The races would be too long if caution laps didn't count.|`|HmkCFddAaa	They count because they are miles run.  So do you  also think that when they pit under yellow they shouldn't loose positions?|`|4l0yGuE9aa	It helps keep the temperature built up in the car's engines, keeps tire's air pressures up, and also it helps the jet dryers dry the track.|`|sXMrY3uwaa	I agree. They don't count at your local dirt track so they shouldn't in NASCAR either.. (atleast thats how I feel)|`|1d8ff4af85cfc3c1463d61e54d554260aa	I completely agree with you they shouldn't count as laps led.|`|i8soZLfRaa	Because the lead can, and often does, change under caution. That is where pit strategy comes into play. One driver might have a mediocre car, but manages to get the 5 bonus points by staying out while the leaders pit to lead a lap, only to pit after the leaders come back out. It can make a difference in standings after the race. To see what I mean, comare the Daytona results to the standings after Daytona. Bonus points figured in shuffled it up some.|`|VQHGqYXvaa	They go by how many miles they run NOT laps . That is why they count the laps!|`|LumFwnwxaa	Because you are still going around the track

ypB3QDWNaa	Older Ericson's are virtually bulletproof.  If yours' is in good shape, you will not have a problem.  If your windvane is functional, then you won't have to be tied to your helm for the entire trip.  I can only think of two absolutely MUST-HAVE peices of equipment.  The first is carrying a real life-raft with you.  If you doubt my advise here, just read Steve Callahan's book 'Adrift'.  This story involves a boat not too dissimilar to yours breaking in the middle of the night for unknown reasons, and then sinking in less than 3 minutes, right in the middle of the Atlantic.  Callahan spent 76 days adrift in his life raft.  The second piece of equipment you NEED, so you don't spend those 76 days in a life-raft waiting to be found, is a type 406 EPIRB.  These are expensive little units that SAVE LIVES.  If you cannot afford one, several marine suppliers will rent you one.  Just imagine yourself floating around for weeks and maybe months, starving and dying of thirst out in the middle of the Atlantic, and you'll do the right thing and at least rent one.|`|C89n5bRNaa	good on you for having a go. i think you will need a lot of wind

One thing about the muzzle loader is they are usually more accurate and have a little more range than the slug gun. I've taken many deer with both slugs and smoke poles and it comes down to shot placement so practice and make a good shot and then enjoy the fresh venison dinner. Good luck with the new gun.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	I would not say that it actually a "best choice," but you can get a .50 caliber Traditions rifle at a pretty modest price.<br>  <br>  If you are a good enough shot, and are patient enough to wait for a perfect shot, you can get by with a .45 caliber rifle, but .50's and .54 caliber rifle hit harder.<br>  <br>  My preference is for the .54 caliber rifles,  IMO these are the best compromise between large bores like the .58 and larger, and the higher velocity of .50 and .45 caliber rifles.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|QrjuueMCaa	I have mostly in-line muzzle loaders and prefer my TC Encore .50. I have also shot the CVA and liked it due to the ease of cleaning. One downfall of the CVA is the sight setup-it seems very rear-high and doesn't come up to the eye easily. Remington is also a great gun. I would recommend going no higher that 100 gr of powder unless you are doing some big game hunting.|`|J9bqxogLaa	Great choice with the 870. I have hunted with one for years and it is a great all around gun.<br>  <br>  I've been black powder hunting for years also and have had several different muzzle loaders. I just recently purchased a Remington Genesis and feel that it is the best muzzle loader I have owned. It is extremely accurate and reasonably priced. I shoot 250 grain saboted Hornady SSTs with 100 grains of Pyrodex in pellet form and it shoots 1" groups at 100 yards and they load very easily. <br>  <br>  The thing I like best is that the plug the primer goes in can be removed with a wrench that is included so both ends of the barrel are open making it very easy to clean.<br>  <br>  The only negative to the Genesis is for some reason the ram rod is just a bit short but I don't feel that it is enough of a reason not to buy it.|`|TvARYVRJaa	cva wolf  have one scoped it with a tc 3-9 scope shoots   on the money as in  hits quarter at 100   shoot 4 times  got 4 deer|`|7royFhIgaa	Remington makes the genisis for a resonable price.|`|9f1815216915b904efd9e933b1a5b03aaa	CVA wolf is a good gun. Make sure that you only use it under the direct supervision of an adult that knows what they are doing.|`|4pLEDSejaa	The question would be - does your dad hunt with a muzzleloader or would he be helping you with it?<br>  A muzzleloader is a complicated thing (for beginners --- especially young ones). They are time consuming to clean and if you don't clean it correctly the gun is flat out ruined. <br>  <br>  If you're going to do it anyway, get a break open muzzleloader with a removable breachplug so you know 100% it's clean. For a beginner, it would be the only way to go --- although I wish I could talk you into a traditional muzzleloader ;) <br>  <br>  I'd recomend just getting a barrel for your 870. <br>  Yes, the barrel is a little more expensive and shells definatly are. But I think it's by far the best choice for you for right now.|`|0ysE0o9faa	Muzzle loaders are cheaper for purchase but, YOu will forever be buying powder bullets and primers not to mention about 10x more work to clean.  I love my black powder guns, and if you like to hunt, it opens A lot more opportunity's and seasons.  Stick a break action, with 209 primer, stick to shooting pellets and use a powerbelt or similar ammo. good luck. The problem even with alot of todays in-line guns is the pain to clean. with a break action it makes it far more user friendly.  CVA makes a great gun cheap|`|Xl8CB3oEaa	i bought a cva for 85$ brand new and it's nice. flat black synthetic stock with fiber optic sights. extremely durable and cheap.
jvRZfkvRaa	I have been told and it seems to work for me.   <br>  <br>  Beathe though your nose during and in between rounds|`|AA12388139	The lungs are like two large dangling balloons.  Most of their area that is to be filled is in the lower, not the higher part.  This means that most of the air can be contained in the lower and not the higher part of your chest.  Therefore learn breathing techniques that draw air by filling the lower part of your chest (near the stomach) first.  Most people are lazy and expand and contract only the upper chest when they breathe.  This means that stale, low oxygenated air remains in the lower lung, preventing maximum oxygen input to the blood circulation system.  In your one minute get rid of any 'stale' air: try blowing all the air out of your lungs through your mouth, contracting your abdomen by pulling it back towards your spine.  Then breathe in through your nose (unless it is blocked) 'sucking' air down to the bottom of your lungs by deliberately expanding your stomach till it bulges.  Only then fill up the top part of your lungs.  Repeat the process.  In other words, use your diaphragm to breathe by moving it down and up (the air flows in by a decrease in pressure rather than by 'sucking').  Better to breathe slow and deliberately rather than hyperventilate in fast pants.  Assist this action and let more blood flow around your lungs by not working or tensing your muscles: slump or relax the body, especially focus on lowering your shoulders down onto the top of your torso.  While standing work your calf muscles as flexing those muscles pumps blood from your lower extremities (where gravity drags on it), this faster return of blood to the heart assists the heart to do its job and, with less straining the heart can slow its squeeze rate.  Of course the mind controls the body (by electrical and chemical messengers and reactions), and your state of mind greatly determines your heart rate etc.  Study how to control fear and focus your mind on things other than the intimidating personality of your opponent.  Instead of going out with an attitude of fighting your opponent as an equal or lessor person, go to him with the attitude of being his teacher and show him how proper technique is to be executed and in that manner you will be more able to 'execute' him rather than he, you.  Spirit wins fights, as you can see by looking into the eyes of the contestants before a fight even begins.|`|6qMaZ0N4aa	I have always been taught to breathe in through the nose and out the mouth using your stomach and not just your upper diaphram and you will get far more Oxygen in you and can relax better.
676irdVmaa	That's not a block, that's foolishness lol. When you get hit flush in the target area, its a point to the opposition. It doesn't matter whether it's to the chin or the forehead, it scores. So doing that just gives them a point. The aim is to score the most points, not to try and knock each other out. Use clever defence work, my brother.|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	move it forward because the puncher is not expecting you to move into a punch so, they won't be prepared for the distance closing in on their traget. but really use it as a last resort|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Actually, the purpose of the move is to tuck your chin behind your shoulder, preventing your opponent from hitting you on the button.  This move is defensive, and designed to prevent you from taking a punch on the point of the chin.  Sometimes the tucked chin in combination with ducking your opponents punch makes them miss, and they end up bouncing the punch off your forehead.  Believe me, it's not an intentional attempt to strike your opponents fist with your head, the occasional hand injuries to opponents are the result of luck, more so than intent.<br>  <br>  If you try and head butt a fist on it's way to your head, even if you succeed, the punch behind it will nail you.  The purpose of punching in combination is to put your opponent in position to get caught avoiding the first punch with the second or third.  Trying to head butt an opponents straight right puts your chin in perfect position for a following left hook, so I would advise you stick to fundamentals.  If a guy breaks his hand on your head, it's his fault, no the result of anything you did to his hand with your head.<br>  <br>  If you try to block a punch with your forehead, your going to get your head knocked off.|`|n8UBfhgpaa	I guess it depends on your tolerance to pain. moving in could break there hand as the head is the hardest part of the body. but theres always the chance you screw up and get decked in the face, and moving in has greater chances of you going to sleep!!, make your choice wisely, and the best choice would be not to fight.|`|AA10709426	Hopefully, a forehead block will be your LAST resort. But if necessary , try to to roll you head to the side. "Smashing into it" could lead to lower neck damage. Slipping a punch is always your best option.|`|niCqMuRVaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=9A78DB26DC5D142B" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=...</a>

7zfcYRqwaa	As long as sports writers think that they are investigative journalist, baseball will never be able to put the steroid era behind it.  The problem is that most media wants to set the agenda for the sports fan and thump their chest like they are the saviors of baseball, when in actuality they are in it just for money and ratings.  Of course professional athletes are going to look for a competitive edge, especially when there is millions of dollars involved.  If you think steroid use didn't happen before the 90's then you are mistaken, you just didn't have ESPN to tell you that it was being used.  Do you think it is a coincidence that the A-Rod story broke during SWEEPS WEEK?  Its not about baseball, it’s about generating ratings.  Baseball will take care of itself.  The Blacksox scandal was way worse than the steroid era; the worse thing for any sports is to lose credibility in crowing its champion, it calls into question effort of the players.  The effort of the players cannot be questioned in the steroid era, if anything you can say the players put out more effort, because steroids don't work if you don't train hard.  Now here comes the argument, what about all the historical records?  Who give a crap about historical records; I want to enjoy baseball now why I am still alive.  If A-Rod hits 800 homers in my life time, that’s great, because I don't have any other life time to see any one hit 800.  Besides baseball is a team sport, so it’s all about championships, not about personal achievements.  Instead of lamenting today’s superstars for "cheating" (but isn't stealing signs cheating, and I was taught how to steal and relay signs by my high school coach) you should be thankful that every year there is a fresh-faces kid from the minors ready to come up and become the next super star, a la Braun, Longoria.  So please, think for a minute that without the sports (wanna be real) journalist, how much would players using steroids really effect the enjoyment of the game.  If you watch baseball because of the personal achievements of a few, then you are watching for the wrong reasons.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Owners don't really care; if they say they do, it's lip service and/or CYAing for possible legal purposes. A team is an investment, and eventually they get around to cashing out by selling it. Which teams have continuous ownership longer than 10, 15 years now? The Yankees. The White Sox. The Orioles. The Twins, I suppose, though Carl just died. Maybe the Royals, Rangers, Mariners, Astros, and Mets (I don't know who owns them any more). Well less than half. Their primary concerns are (a) selling tickets, (b) collecting TV money, (d) getting a new park (if not already), and (d) winning. Pretty much in that order.<br>  <br>  Fans? There's always a new generation coming along, fans who will watch their first game (and get hooked) in 2009. And there's also still a contingent that thinks the Dodgers shoulds moves backs ta Brooklyns. The point, established opinions rarely change, even in the face of surmounted, weighty evidence.<br>  <br>  Here's some data, which I might use for a question soon, but let's use it directly. Major League Baseball average attendance (total fans divided by total games, regular season), 1990-2008 (with delta from previous season):<br>  <br>  1990 -- 26045<br>  1991 -- 27003 (+958)<br>  1992 -- 26529 (-474)<br>  1993 -- 30964 (+4435)<br>  1994 -- 31256 (+292)<br>  1995 -- 25022 (-6234)<br>  1996 -- 26510 (+1488)<br>  1997 -- 27877 (+1367)<br>  1998 -- 29030 (+1153)<br>  1999 -- 28888 (-142)<br>  2000 -- 29378 (+490)<br>  2001 -- 29881 (+503)<br>  2002 -- 28007 (-1874)<br>  2003 -- 27831 (-175)<br>  2004 -- 30075 (+2244)<br>  2005 -- 30817 (+741)<br>  2006 -- 31307 (+490)<br>  2007 -- 32696 (+1390)<br>  2008 -- 32382 (-314)<br>  <br>  There's a lot of effects in play -- 1993 shows the impact of expansion (esp. the Rockies, who drew over 4 million), 1995 shows post-strike resentment, 2002-03 a weak economy and probably broadband thrift following the 9/11 attacks. And there's many new parks in this window, the Expos purposely tanking their attendance and moving to Washington, the '98 home run derby, another expansion. But -- where's the anti-steroid backlash? Where did the outraged fans begin staying away? (2008's dip was, again, mostly economy-driven, I think.) If some righteous fans ARE staying away, they're being more than adequately replaced, and from MLB's point of view, that's just peachy.<br>  <br>  Fans might care or SAY they care, but they're still buying tickets.<br>  <br>  The media, well, there's no helping some people. The ones who have resentment will take it to their graves, and the more sanguine ones will be unable to disseminate their enlightenment amongst their fraternity. Just nod, faintly smile, and ignore the noise.<br>  <br>  The game will never be the same because the game never IS the same. It evolves continuously. Steroids were a factor, probably still are although severely reduced in dispersal, but it will take at least a generation for the stupidity to stop drowning out any meaningful dialogues, and that's too bad.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	It'll never get a "proper" perspective because none of the groups that you mentioned are purely objective.  Fans will always forgive their own teams and favourite players.  The media used to be unbiased and objective, but it seems that a growing number of writers and broadcasters are becoming cheerleaders these days.  The owners will certainly never put the proper spin on this issue because they knew what was going on and cast a blind eye at everything.  At best they stuck their heads in the sand and told themselves "everything is okay as long as I don't see anything happening".  At worst, they were aiding and abetting by knowingly employing drug-using athletes.<br>  Besides, there's still a segment of the viewing public that doesn't see any harm in the use of performance enhancing drugs.  Before we can get a "proper" perspective, we're going to have to hammer out whether steroids and HGH are acceptable or not.|`|BD7yd8D4aa	First MLB and the owners need to admit there is a problem instead of living in denial and hoping that the issues will be swept under the rug. Until that happens I think this is impossible to predict.|`|TCehI17kaa	Won't happen till the symbol of these problems Bud Selig & Donald Fehr are gone from the baseball scene. These two have caused alot  harm to the game of Baseball.|`|WWT45CEzaa	it will take a long time<br>   any player who having a good year<br>   you look at and think what  he on|`|ZatADRPXaa	Never.  <br>  <br>  There's no such thing as a proper perspective in sports vs the same sports in different eras.  Everybody likes to say that Babe Ruth would have dominated today, or he would have been awful today, but nobody really knows.  Do you try to project Ruth as if he'd had access to modern training, nutrition, etc, or do you compare him as he was to players today?  Do you account for changes in field dimensions, technology, media, etc?  Would he have been as much of a standout if he'd been playing against all competition, not just white players, even in the 1920's?<br>  <br>  The same goes for the steroid era; how many players have been using what for how long?  What exactly did the substances do - would Bonds have just hit 68 homeruns instead of 73 in 2001, or would he have been a scrappy guy with good power and speed like he was in Pittsburgh (if he was clean then?).<br>  <br>  There's no way to quantify a comparison between time periods in any sports, especially when you throw in variables as unknown as those that define the steroid era.|`|38d6d7d6011bdd646925e15a23ec4590aa	Good Q.<br>  <br>  To your Question Honestly i don't know it makes me think if the Commissioner , the Union payed attention Rick Helling  when he said they was a steroid problem  in the off season of 1998 they would and could prevented a lot more than they have to deal with at the moment, I just think Baseball was and in a Sense still im not being to accept the fact there is steroids in the game and you need to change it.<br>  <br>  It  wont happen until the Commissioner, the Union and for most the players open their eyes and get some integrity and respect for baseball|`|NJZA6Pktaa	I think it will take a while, I know people are slow to change their believes in some fundamental things.

HuwEDF0Qaa	Nice spinning hook kick.  It is not, however, a spinning 'back' kick.  A back kick, like a front kick, is a linear kick delivered on a vertical plane.  The hook kick you are performing is a curving kick delivered on a horizontal plane.<br>  <br>  But, all in all, a very well executed kick.|`|nv5Mewe3aa	It looks like you are striking the pad with the "palm" or ball of your foot. Is that so? (If that is the case, then the kick is good for point scoring, however you won't do much damage that way.) Also I noticed you are throwing kicks from different stances and different distances. If you are going to do a tutorial, then your demonstration needs to be consistent. Also some better camera work would help. <br>  <br>  Not picking on you, just trying to point out what I see here to help you out.|`|gBO908P6aa	very good my man, very good|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	You are telegraphing your kick because you are moving your front leg to set it up. Also you need to strike with the heel for more power and not the toes or ball of the foot as you are doing here. This is not a back kick nor is it a hook kick. You are actually performing a spinning wheel kick since the leg is straight throughout the entire kick. One thing that you are doing that is good is your eyes meet the target before your kick lands...

739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	I know, I just hate that and yea I think it's to accommodate the west coast which in my opinion is kinda silly.  I can see starting a bit latter for them but come on most races here start 1:30 or 2 so if CA started at the same time we'd of been racing by 4:30 or 5 NOT 6:30.  I didn't like that start time at all.|`|sXMrY3uwaa	Whoever said Weather is wrong...<br>  <br>  They talked about this BS last season...

Instead of eating up all afternoon, I wish these races started @ 10am here in Texas so I'd have more to be able to do after the race|`|EHtFxGxMaa	Yes, The time difference makes it a challenge some weeks.<br>  <br>  Just like the olympics.

They also try to accomodate the west coast because if the race started at noon on the east coast, that would be 9 am on the west coast.  That is a little too early.|`|LOFmGU89aa	You can't have a night race at 12:30 in the afternoon.|`|PDYdcSliaa	Goodness.  Let me guess, tolerance is not one of your virtues.

4maLlESdaa	If your husband has an overall fear of water, swimming lessons would help. Even though you don't have to be a strong swimmer to go kayaking, the confidence in being able to swim without a life vest would help with the fear (even though you should never paddle without one). Though if he goes tubing now, the water itself might not be the issue.<br>  <br>  A lot of people initially have a fear about being trapped inside the kayak if it flips over. He may want to start with a sit-on-top, so he'd just fall out if the kayak capsizes. Take him somewhere with warm, calm water. Some kayak shops and schools even have swimming pools. If he later wants to move to a closed-deck (sit-inside) boat, do it gradually. Start without a sprayskirt, and practice capsizing on purpose.<br>  <br>  Working with a kayak instructor will help too. Good instructors will have a lot of tips and tricks for overcoming fear. In addition, an instructor can act as a "neutral" party. Funny as it sounds, from my experience teaching, people tend to trust me more when I tell them they need to capsize-- because it's just "part of the class"-- than if they were to hear it from their significant others.<br>  <br>  A couple things NOT to do: Don't pressure your husband too much to go. You want him to enjoy kayaking, not make it feel like a chore. Let him progress at his own pace, which will probably be different from your own. And whatever you do, don't get him in over his head. By the end of the season, Class II whitewater might seem like child's play to you, but it certainly isn't your (or his) first time through. Just one bad experience can set back a beginner a long way.|`|E61JEnJ8aa	I am glad to hear that you adore kayaking its a great water sport.   I can understand your husbands experience with almost drowning giving him a great fear of water and kayaking.    I would suggest taking a trip to West Virginia and getting your husband to do the Middle New River, very calm section of the new river.   Class 1 to 3 rapids you have to wear a pfd and you have a guide with you.    You can either do that section of water in duckie or a 8 person raft.   This may help him overcome the fear.<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  Kim
dnl66ZXTaa	Definately- but its not really your weight that depends on if you fly or not.... Its more on if you can pull up and be tight in the air. I weigh 115 and I fly just because I can stunt and be tighter in the air without losing my balance better than the 105 girls. But flying isn't easy to any extent but your height or weight doesn't matter as much as what you do one you get in the air.<br>  <br>  The hard part are learning to do stunts where you have to do all the work like 360's or full downs. But if you have a group that can get and keep you in the air without shaking or dropping you you will be fine. Good Luck!|`|py5TAGE8aa	Are you kidding?  Depending on your age...Junior and senior squads would have a hay day with you!  Although, just remember, even though you aren't the tallest one on the team and definitely probably not the biggest, they may use you for other options such as tumbler, too.  It's not just the smallest and lightest girl/boy who flies!!  You have to be able to lock out your knees, stand on one foot for a lengthy period of time, and be willing to have your breath taken when you come down.  As well as trust in your bases!  Good Luck!|`|MgInp7sWaa	definitely not, you and I are about the same size. the only qualifications for a flyer are that you need to be able to hit all of your stunts well and consistently. It also helps if your not afraid of trying new and kinda dangerous stunts.|`|qT5rKKYKaa	I know a girl who is stick thin and feels heavy to the stunt group because she is not tight and does not carry her weight right so if you can do that you're all set!
dKQ5oDo9aa	You are probably having trouble with the landing because of your takeoff.  after the 3turn, be sure to keep your free leg behind you and your arms checked. Why you bring your leg through, turn your foot like you would kick a soccer fall (inside of your foot facing out). keep your shoulders level and not twisted. Strongly check your arms on the landing, keep a slightly bent knee on your support leg, and make sure you kick your free leg straight back, not swing it wide. <br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|WhPVEnk1aa	my sister is a very keen skater umm i would say always keep your knees bent and try land without hitting the ice with your tow pick obviously and yes you will need to strengthen your ankles as they will give way with your weight being put down on them ( hope this helped)|`|StWYMSv0aa	it helps me when i think of it as a 3 turn with a walts jump at the end <br>  <br>  same thing with double sal<br>  <br>  PICK ME!|`|EmYNUZcXaa	honestly i would have to watch you to see what your doing wrong. you can have a poor landing based on a few things with a salchow. the most common i've seen, however, is when you jump from your turning foot to your landing foot, pretend there is a step your stepping up on and "jump to the (invisible) step." if your having trouble, ask someone to watch you do a salchow and see if they see anything going on. good luck to you, keep practicing and you'll get it :)|`|lnRMmSeyaa	well since your landing is what your having trouble with its probably the take-off thats making you fall<br>  <br>  when you go to take off make sure when you do your 3-turn your leg isnt swinging around keep it tight in place, and make sure your not leaning forward too much, then when you go to take off bend your knee up and just jump up like your doing a waltz jump, if you still cant get your balance when you go to land, try jumping very small, and doing some off ice training where all you do is salchow's<br>  <br>  good luck,im sure you can do it if you really try<br>  <br>  figure skater of 6 years <3
65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	If you've got the dedication, there's nothing that can stop you from making the team at your college.  It is often harder to stay focused without a coach to push you,  but it is possible.  And acting as your own coach does have great benefits:<br>  <br>  -You're in it for you.  Team coaches often have the additional agenda that if you do well, it makes them look good.  As your own coach, you have a vested interest in the success of the person you are coaching.<br>  <br>  -No communication problems.  You know exactly what is going on physically and mentally, and don't have to try to communicate that to a coach.<br>  <br>  -Your own schedule.  If you want your day off each week to be Monday, that's fine, you're not structured by after school practice.  Your workout can be tailored to fit your needs, rather than trying to do workouts that benefit a whole group of runners.<br>  <br>  Documenting progress is very good.  Training hard every day isn't.  You need to structure your recovery just as much as structuring your workouts.  Always take at least 1 day every week off completely, and make sure you include easy days mixed in.  Hardcore workouts every single day are an easy way to get hurt or burn out physically and watch your times get slower even as you're pushing harder.  And you don't have to do a bunch of local races.  Choose strategic ones - train towards a "season" of your own making.<br>  <br>  Not everyone does as well in a structured team setting.  I train better on my own, holding only myself accountable.  Some people need teammates to push them, others don't.  You won't know till you try.<br>  <br>  As for going back, what's to keep that anxiety about gaining a position away?  You're talking about running in college, that will be on a team, competing for spots, with a coach pushing you.  I suggest skipping just this spring track season, and work hard towards fall XC, and see how you feel then.  If you're in great shape, might as well go back and show it off a bit, maybe you can come away with a great finish to your high school career?|`|W8xQKafjaa	yes absolutely. You should run in fields or near bodies of water. This atmosphere made me enjoy nature and truly appreciate the beauty of it. The softer soil is good for your joints, but i don't reccomend running by yourself unless you are sure there won't be stalkers around. I have also found that running with a friend or my dad keeps me motivated and happy. I ran by the lake the other day and the waves and sound of rushing water made me feel so relaxed and content.
mMFJrPbvaa	14 miles even on flat ground would be tough on kids that age.  Not only is it physically demanding, and i`m sure they have the extra energy to burn, but its also mentally taxing.  What if one gets bored and they other wants to keep going?  There are plenty of other summits you can tackle that aren't as grueling.  But to hike something that is more than 3x`s what they are used to is going to be tough.  How do they handle the 4 mile hikes you guys currently go on? Now just imagine that is just under 1/3 of the hike you are planning.  It may be beneficial to break the hike up into an over night like someone suggested.  You can definitely build them upto that point but I would wait until they are a bit older.<br>  <br>  I was a trek guide for the scouts for about 6 yrs and the youngest we allow on treks is 13 yrs old, even then they have their issues.  Some are seasoned for the outdoors others come from the city, maturity also plays a big part.  I`ve had "seasoned" scouts break down on the trail and i`ve had scouts from the city who hardly ever go camping make the entire trip without any complaints, to my suprise.  So it`s hard to say what will happen.  You know your children best, but dont forget they are young, even if you can taste the summit you may have to turn around in the best interest of your kids.|`|AA11105507	I have hiked up Mt Marcy in the past, but not with children.  I can tell you that it's a long hike just to get to the base of the summit.  If you start out at Adirondack Loj and take the Van Hoevenberg Trail, you'll need to hike over 7 miles one way.  Once you get to the base of the summit, the climb is fairly easy.  The toughest part will probably be the hike back to the Loj.  Everytime I hiked in that area, the hike back to the car always seemed endless.  Good Luck...and have fun!|`|AA11620976	Personally I think that you're allowing your inexperience and your ego to over-rule your reason and that you're jeopardizing the safety and well being of your kids in the process<br>  Regardless of who does it a 15 mile hike is a long day on trail .If the weather turns to crap at mile 10 and your seven year old's small uninsulated body starts suffering the negative effects of hypothermia are you equipped to carry him to safety ? Y'now a Camp Trails Freighter Frame +some climbing webbing >lash the kid in and start moving out ala Maurice Herzog on Annapurna<br>  Personally I would use  Marcy Dam lean-to's for two nights and knock  the round trip to Marcy summit down to a more do-able 10 miles or so

DeSCJn0paa	Well i would do a number of different exercises. Swimming is really good because it works just about every muscle in your body. Jogging is really great too. But you have to remember that your muscles have a memory too. So muscle confusion is the key here. Your body will get use to what your doing and you'll find that wont be able to build muscle or loose weight as effectively as you use to. So change up your exercise routine.<br>  <br>  I lost about 100 pounds by doing it that way. Oh and with a good diet.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Open the door, get on the floor, everybody walk the Labrador!<br>  <br>  I dropped 60 pounds in a year from walking two of those barking mules about a mile every day.|`|VT1BSwFcaa	A good mix of all will help you loose wait.<br>  Jogging and skipping are not so good for the joints, swimming, cycling and walking are easy on the knees.

Sorry I couldn't get to you sooner  but better late than never. <br>  <br>  <br>  Local spots:<br>  <br>  U.S.1 & 79 street...you'll find a park to your right as you go over the bridge ( going east towards Miami Beach) . Great for snapper, Barracuda, and pot luck fishing.<br>  <br>  38 st and Biscayne- fish under the first bridge, first 2 pilings, for big snapper. Parking is scarce so get there early. Use only mojjaras for best results.<br>  <br>  Rickenbacker: Go over the large bridge and keep right. pull into park and park. You'll see the cat walk on your right, right under the large bridge you just crossed. Walk down to the 5-6th. light post and cast out as far as you can ( bay side) . There's a rock pile out there that holds big fish. Use live baits for best results. ( pilchards)<br>  <br>    Same area, early morning, fish the flats on and around the park for bones, tarpon, Barracudas, Snook and sharks. get there before the sun does, understand?<br>  <br>  Travel south and go towards Homestead, snook capital. There's a bunch of places to fish around Miami-Dade...Tamiami trail is good and so on. You should start with ( www.myfwc.com) for locations and do some searching on your free time. just watch yourself and travel with a friend. If you're down my way ( homestead) look me up at Hi-Lo.~good luck catchin'.|`|90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	Granny lived on a canal outside of Miami when I was little... so I haven't fished down there since the days of yarn, safety pins and hot dogs, but we sure did feed a mess of fish. There's a LOT of water down there, and where there's a lot of water, there's a lot of places for fish to be. I'd go with the specific suggestions given above and then branch out... "Hmm, that outfall looks nice" "what's in that retention pond?" Up here in my neck of central Florida it's amazing what will live in a retention pond next to a shopping center... I'm a firm believer in looking for fish right under people's noses... that little speck of a pond down the road that you never see anyone but kids trying to fish in? Go in there with what you know and see what the kids are missing... if they keep coming back, something's at least stealing their bait. But remember, just because everyone fishes a certain spot, doesn't necessarily make it any good... there's a stretch of seawall in town here that for some reason everyone and their brother flocks there... sure, there's occasionally a redfish or a trout caught, and from the bridge right there occasional black drum or mangrove snapper, but mostly all that gets caught in the most accessible (and therefore more packed) area are puffers, catfish and stingrays... I don't understand it.|`|lECmz3SEaa	get a hold of charles sloan or fisherking, and gimmename

I'm 6'2" and ride a 58cm.<br>  <br>  650 wheels are either for very small frames or tri specific bikes. The advantage they offer is less wind resistance due to the smaller profile. The major downside is tires and tubes are harder to come by since those wheels are pretty uncommon. In answer to your question, yes, I think you would be unhappy with those wheels.|`|Jr5YZ8Qbaa	Depends on your proportions and what feels comfortable to you, but a 55cm bike sounds small for your height.

Just keep working hard, and you should be able to do it after a week. <br>  <br>  Try running 2 miles at one speed your first day (maybe a 9:30 mile to start with). <br>  -<br>  Then, on day 2, try running one mile, slightly faster (maybe a 9:00 pace). <br>  -<br>  On day 3, try to run 2 miles at the previous day's pace (9:00 miles). <br>  -<br>  On day 4, push yourself and run the 8:30.<br>  <br>  After the first week, you'll feel the urge to get faster and run longer! You may even try double the distance at the same speed in your second week. In a year or so, you'll probably be addicted to running, and trying to hit 25 miles every week, at AT LEAST an 8:00 mile pace, if not A LOT faster.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure you're eating good, and stretching A LOT before AND after your run.|`|eaLuDhyfaa	On the contrary, the treadmill would be very helpful.  Short sprints will not help you get down your mile run time.  Running a mile or two on the treadmill regularly will get your endurance up, strengthen your lungs and your heart.  You will find yourself doing the mile much more easily, and can start to speed up when you feel ready.|`|8bd9a90bff1b1965c563ac670645d9e2aa	run more sprints, to get you better and quicker|`|Wjp0niEhaa	The more you run, the better your mile time will improve.  Good running shoes can make a huge difference.  I'd recommend some Asics running shoes from the website listed below.  Also try to eat healthier, and lose some weight.  The less weight you carry, the faster you'll go.  Build up your mileage per week, and you'll be running faster in no time.  And a treadmill would be helpful, if it can get you to run more on bad weather days.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.holabirdsports.com/m/Running/Running-Shoes_Men/Asics/p1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.holabirdsports.com/m/Running/...</a>
RuJYupFWaa	You don't NEED a new feedneck, the Rotor will fit, but the stock feedneck does not clamp, it has "friction o-rings" instead.  Works fine but many people prefer clamping ones (myself included).|`|QcmNHRzyaa	i would buy a clamping feedneck

qyATAaeXaa	I had to look this thing up on wikipedia. My guess is that you could use it at any resort that also allows ski-bobbing (ski-biking.)<br>  <br>  Check this link:<br>  <a href="http://www.asa.ski-bike.org/canada.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asa.ski-bike.org/canada.html</a>
McNFyt2Raa	Juice!|`|qvuQSQvpaa	either run wit a sled or anything weighing u down. or drop body weight|`|sAHTMuAeaa	Pick em up and put em down in a more timely fashion.|`|JXyKWrQEaa	it's all in the start, think more of a sprinter start than a football 3-point stance start, then antcipate the start just as you would the snap,  practice running tens instead of forties, this will give you more emphasis on getting off the ball.  When you are running make sure you have no wasted motion, keep all motion moving down the line you are running. don't allow arm to get to far behind you keep them pumping hard and short straight forward.|`|pDrm6J2Taa	Front Squats are the key, I used to run a 4.95 three weeks ago but since my football conditioning has started & squats were introduced to me i ran a 4.85. I advise just squat and run. Workout your hamstrings and gloots.
