You may end up doing a lot of work, but a grade is a grade. If you want the grade, you may have to do more than your share in this particular situation.<br>  <br>  Be thorough and accurate in your peer review (essentially that's a structured way of tattling in situations like this). Add a little narrative to the end of that review (a short paragraph describing what actually occurred) - and give it to the professor.<br>  <br>  Clearly, this isn't the best of situations. However, it happens routinely in real life, as well, especially in the work place.

iT5dgRVgaa	You don't want to move. It is not THAT bad. Even in the Great Depression, unemployment rates were at 25%. That means 3 out of 4 people had a job. Of course, that's bad, but it could be MUCH worse. Right now, the US is at 6.7% unemployment I think. <br>  <br>  Anyways. If it was bad here, it would be bad EVERYWHERE. In the past 100 years, the world has become incredibly connected. What affects one major country will certainly affect another. It's not as simple as "the US is bad, so I will move somewhere good".|`|XgH9uuv9aa	No it's desperate here too.<br>  <br>  Here's the story:<br>  <br>  The UK economic crisis is directly linked to the housing market. Quality housing is always in demand, yet people who have the money to build and replenish our housing stock find it almost impossible to get ‘permission’. Houses are not exempt from supply and demand issues - why should they be. it’s insane that banks have been allowed to trade on the back of house price inflation caused by the shortage of homes due to misguided legislation . For around half the price of even the current ‘market value’ the equivalent modern home could be built – that is if you can find a plot. And the price of a plot? If you have ￡100.000 you might start looking….but for that money don’t expect anything larger than a postage stamp site in someone else back yard.<br>  <br>  We will never crack the economic problems in the UK until we stop using housing as 'currency' - that  means not until the high cost of building plots is addressed and the planning laws that prevent home building  have caused the hype are radically revised.<br>  <br>  Also consider this:<br>  <br>  "Owners of capital will stimulate the working class to buy more and more of<br>  expensive goods, houses and technology, pushing them to take more and more<br>  expensive credits, until their debt becomes unbearable. The unpaid debt will<br>  lead to bankruptcy of banks, which will have to be nationalized, and the State<br>  will have to take the road which will eventually lead to communism" .   <br>  <br>  Who said that. and when?<br>  Karl Marx, Das Kapital, 1867

wSqOwWlVaa	True forgiveness of another person, is to love the one who did you wrong, as though it was you who did them a wrong.<br>  <br>  True forgiveness from somebody else involves truly forgiving yourself, accept what you did, accept that it was a human flaw.  But if you can't accept it enough to be honest about it, how much forgiveness can you truly get - from yourself or somebody else?  Sometimes just admitting the truth outloud can be healing for you  What did you do?  Why did you do it?  Is it really that unforgiveable?  Face up to yourself, take a deep breath, and try not to do it again.  To err is human, to forgive is divine, but we're all capable of it  :-)|`|XIbct4fuaa	I think to truly forgive you have to be able to truly forget.  If you can forget it then you probably cant get over it and cant really forgive it.  If you step on my foot accidentally I can forgive you because I can easily forget it.  But if you cheat on me I am never going to really be able to forget that.<br>  <br>  Know it All-Are you talking about the drivers seat or the toilet seat?  Your answer went right over my head man.|`|6KTVBhvgaa	Both you and the person you forgive both know in your hearts through love.  Knowing that peace is there no matter what the outcome. Love accomplishes all things.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Forgiveness is in putting the seat back before sitting down. True forgiveness is in keeping the seat up after the act is done.<br>  <br>  Holly, the driver's seat issue hasn't been noticeable enough to increase the divorce rates. ;-)|`|vEj7xoBraa	Wouldn't you like forgiveness? forgiveness when  someone has done something wrong to you but you keep on liking the person.|`|d1805dca25d00374cb2c98883d99b807aa	Forgiveness is letting go of the need for revenge and releasing negative thoughts of bitterness and resentment. If you are a parent, you can provide a wonderful model for your children by forgiving. If they observe your reconciliation with friends or family members who have wronged you, perhaps they will learn not to harbor resentment over the ways in which you may have disappointed them. If you are not a parent, forgiveness is still an extremely valuable skill to have.<br>  Forgiveness can be a gift that we give to ourselves. Here are some easy steps towards forgiveness:<br>  <br>  Acknowledge your own inner pain. <br>  Express those emotions in non-hurtful ways without yelling or attacking. <br>  Protect yourself from further victimization. <br>  Try to understand the point of view and motivations of the person to be forgiven; replace anger with compassion. <br>  Forgive yourself for your role in the relationship. <br>  Decide whether to remain in the relationship. <br>  Perform the overt act of forgiveness verbally or in writing. If the person is dead or unreachable, you can still write down your feelings in letter form. <br>  What Forgiveness Is Not…<br>  Forgiveness is not forgetting or pretending it didn’t happen. It did happen, and we need to retain the lesson learned without holding onto the pain. <br>  Forgiveness is not excusing. We excuse a person who is not to blame. We forgive because a wrong was committed. <br>  Forgiveness is not giving permission to continue hurtful behaviors; nor is it condoning the behavior in the past or in the future. <br>  Forgiveness is not reconciliation. We have to make a separate decision about whether to reconcile with the person we are forgiving or whether to maintain our distance. <br>  Forgiving and letting go can be very difficult challenges, but it’s even more stressful to hold on to grudges. There are several symbolic letting-go rituals that can help with the process. If you are having trouble forgiving someone else, write them a letter expressing all of your feelings and explaining why you need to let go. You don’t need to mail that letter — it is cathartic just to write it all down. You can also write down all of your excess “baggage” on a piece of paper and burn it or cast it into the sea in a bottle when you are ready to really let go.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	Forgiveness benefits the person giving it more than the person receiving it.  It lifts the weight off your heart.  Grudges are heavy loads.  Forgiving doesn't mean forgetting, it just means letting it go.  I have forgiven my father for leaving when I was a child, but he didn't ask for my forgiveness, nor have I forgotten what he did.  I just didn't want the burden any more.|`|qLBsTaDlaa	True forgiveness is not caring anymore. Forgetting. Doesn't mean you let that person back, but you choose to not let the action affect you.|`|LR48Rtv2aa	I don't know what true forgiveness is because I have never had the pleasure of just letting past hurts go.
YZ7HOZ3raa	I took a class in college of the psychology of sleep. One of the things we discussed was lucid dreaming; some of the other students said they had experienced these before and talked about how cool they were. According to our professor, a lucid dream is being able to control your own dreams. Like if you said i wanna fly over the pacific ocean that's what you would do. or if you didn't like the dream your were having you could change it. <br>  <br>  No one knows why we dream, and no one knows why some people can have lucid dreams. But supposedly there are books that you can buy that teaches you how to have lucid dreams, but i have never tried them out myself.<br>  ;)

Meistens stimmt es auch.|`|5cc02c34054e9aa4924a48b3321cd027aa	aus erfahrung, man kennt halt immer Leute, die ein bestimmtes Aussehen haben und man ordnet so das Aussehen ihrem Namen zu.Das ist aber bei jedem verschieden.Ich will jetzt kein beispiel geben, will ja keinen beleidigen;-)|`|6a3554ef5cb5e4b81c22aba1e2cab1c8aa	Ich denke dass man das ?u?ere eines Menschen mit dem Vornamen assoziiert liegt daran, dass man in der Regel Menschen mit eben diesen Namen schonmal kennengelernt hat. Wenn ich z.B. mehrere Frauen mit dem Namen Angela h?re, naja, dann denke ich nicht gerade an eine 20-j?hrige. <br>  Aber manchmal denke ich kann man einfach nicht aufgrund eines Vornamen auf das ?u?ere eines Menschen schlie?en, das liegt vor allem daran, dass heutzutage oft wieder traditionelle Namen gebraucht werden und Namen wie Christel, Herbert, Heinrich, Franz-Josef nicht mehr nur auf ?ltere Menschen passen. <br>  Und ohne Witz, ich habe heute im Radio geh?rt dass wohl als zweite Vornamen auch wieder der Name Adolf gebraucht wird. <br>  Wenn du also zum Beispiel einem jungen Typ begegnest und dieser sich vorstellt, kann es wohl bald auch mal vorkommen dass er Heinrich Adolf hei?t und trotzdem nett ist...|`|d62aa6848a515f15def0584c9513fcf8aa	Und beim Charakter und wie sich jemand verh?lt assoziiert man ein bestimmtes Sternzeichen ,wird beim Vornamen genau so sein!|`|5b3a085329d733bdc6fc5cd428cfb9b2aa	Bestimmte Namen kommen aus bestimmten sozialen Schichten - denk mal etwa an Namen wie Vanessa und Karl-Heinz oder an solche wie Philipp und Laura, und dann versuche mal Dir vorzustellen, in welchem Stadtteil die wohnen, und wie da der "typische" Bewohner in einer TV-Serie aussehen würde.<br>  <br>  Andere Namen, die gew?hnlicheren wie Andreas oder Katja oder so, erinnern Dich an viele mit dem gleichen Namen.

vnwjfNCxaa	Due to the fact that most people commit suicide at sundown or after, I always say: Wait until tomorrow morning.  The morning after, everything looks different and can be seen with another perspective, plus people are around to find help.  The dusk, night and winters are the ones that aggravate cases of depression.  If you feel you are depressed wintertime, take a short vacation to a sunny place, it will give you an uplifting experience, or better yet try to move to a sunnier place.  But please, DO NOT GO AHEAD TO GIVE INTO SUICIDE.

You need to give yourself time to grow (up) & learn how to put up the boundries that keep you from getting taken advantage of.

I could the county and they explained the process and there were so many hoops, I found it funny.  They were more messed up than me.  I actually felt better.  That time passed.  A few years later I met my wife to be, and have two beautiful daughters in college.  My brother just turned to drugs and slowly found only sadness.  <br>  He never tried to find the light of day.

What would you say to them that because of a few selfish and demanding and ungrateful individuals you feel the need to take your life. I lost  my cousin to suicide and it was so hard. He didn't know he was so loved and adored by friends and family. Because someone didn't treat his love with respect and I suppose getting caught with dope by his mother (he felt so badly about that - that he lost her trust and maybe respect) were reasons for him to do such an act.  We still miss him; we didn't get a chance to see him graduate and so all the things he had planned to do. So in short - to the guy contemplating suicide I would shout NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  Do  not end your life because of ungrateful and selfish people. You live your life and concentrate on your dreams and making your life better. <br>  I'm not sure how many of us will respond to your question but I hope it is many and by that I hope you realize that even as strangers we Care.<br>  Live - Laugh - Love and enjoy life and value yours. Only you can destroy you and only you can allow people to bring you down. <br>  Take a walk, go somewhere and be around people, do something for  yourself such as see a movie, buy shoes if you can. Concentrate on yourself for awhile. And if these people are not relatives find new friends. Live - Live - Live.

7Vgpz1Zlaa	You need to start by speaking to your b/f. Let him know that it bothers you when he does this. If you need comfort, tell him you need comfort. If his actions continue, and you are not happy with your relationship, then you need to leave. Next, You really need to talk to the neighbor. She sounds like a ******! Let her know that you are doing her a favor by picking up her children every day for school. Tell her you would appreciate it if next time she brings them, that she inform you. Its just plain rude not to. Sounds to me like she needs to be put in her place. Shes obviously taking your kindness for weakness.

The Christmas Show to me sounds like you just want to have some fun with friends, and that you wish to keep your spirit alight.|`|qKhGAADMaa	well, sometimes when people think of Christmas time, it's usually thought of as a joyful time for kids. So these dreams could be about you remembering or craving back your childhood.<br>  <br>  another idea is that maybe something unusual occurred last Christmas or a Christmas before that thus making the event of Christmas time repetitive in your dreams to remind you of an incident.<br>  <br>  hope i helped, Jenzo xx
MbKQ5Xc0aa	hi, attention is focusing on particular stimuli in presence of various stimuli<br>  <br>  there are many theories filter theory, then morays experiment,resource allocation  etc.<br>  <br>  selective attention is very important as only those stimuli on which we focus or dedicate more resources will cross over to memory where it is categorised and concepts are also developed which hepls us in thinking,learning and problem solving. so whole the basic component in selective attention. though there is incidental learning but it is very less when compared to intentional you can elaborate on this.<br>  <br>  for selective attention next time focus on lecture not on girls in front seat.

How do they react to/interact with other people?<br>  Are they frowning/smiling/what? Do they speak openly, or are they being quiet?<br>  It's not so hard, really.<br>  Being far away and observing can in some ways tell you a lot more about how a person is feeling than close up, because when you're close up, they try and hide it.<br>  <br>  Luck with..whatever it is you're trying to do here >.>|`|sWwzzOCaaa	I don't believe everyone has this sense about them but I can tell you that I feel I do to a certain extent.

TKDi70uTaa	good q, of course it is, everywhere we go people are joking about how drunk they got and the stupid things they did. i used to enjoy a drink but not so much anymore, i am trying to raise my kids to not think of alcohol as a social necessity, my brothers and sisters cannot seem to operate without at least one bottle of wine per day each. they pass it off as if im boring but i can see they actually need that alcohol. now my mother in law comes to visit she always has to bring alcohol, every single time, and now she encourages my son who is 16 by bringing him beer. she wants him in her drinking circle. im the bad guy because he likes it and my wife wants me to keep the peace. everyone is oblivious, the funny thing is they sit there pontificating about drugs etc while off their face on booze, hypocrites.|`|ZRaOUNThaa	If a child grows up with an alcoholic parent - it is normal to them as that is their experience of family life and the only way they know.|`|j1reoYyYaa	No alcoholism isn't normal and won't be. I agree to what you have in mind. People just take for granted about the things alcoholism produces to the society which is not good in a way. Since all it produce aren't good for the family and the whole society. I think alcohol should be treated as drugs do in the society since it creates problem as drugs do.

If you need, write out a list of things you like about yourself, go shopping and give yourself a makeover. Whatever you do though, do it for you, and not to please anyone. At the end of the day you have to face yourself, not them.<br>  <br>  btw i've started an advice column on youtube about questions like this. i actually just made one on self esteem that might help you out. if you want to check it out and comment whatever other questions you may have i'd be glad to answer them. :)<br>  <br>  just type in thatbrowngirl890 on youtube or go straight to the link with<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZ6cS7QtfM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaZ6cS7Qt...</a>|`|vAdtlZDpaa	The most important first step to break your habit of self-criticism and to raise your self-esteem is to have a clear desire to feel better. We know it sounds simplistic, but when nothing is more important than that you "feel" better, so you are then willing to try to find increasingly better feeling thoughts, you can gradually change your vibrational patterns regarding anything, and when you do that, your manifestations must change also.<br>  <br>  <br>  Take a look at this website and see if there is anything helpful for you.<br>  It has helped me a lot:<br>  <a href="http://whatanicewebsite.com/Faq/index.php?action=show&cat=4" rel="nofollow">http://whatanicewebsite.com/Faq/index.ph...</a>|`|ByxEE8eeaa	It's hard to give advice that will be any help. If you have any close friends, family, or anyone else you're comfortable around, spend some time with them, learning to be at ease with who you are. If you don't have anyone like this, even pets can help you raise your self-esteem. You just need to learn how to act how you feel and be comfortable enough to expose yourself a little. Take some chances and you'll definitely feel the rewards.|`|xBleAz7oaa	wait a minute, you have a computer in the kitchen?
kynzqmWgaa	I think you are just nervous around new people because you might say something awkward.  If you get rid of the thought of worrying what people are thinking about you and just say as you feel without feeling guilty, then you'll be okay.|`|1TPGdaXJaa	Probably one of the best things you can do is to continue to go out and make a genuine attempt to be social. Sure, it will be akward for a while, but more people feel this way than you might think. Practice and exposure in social situations will ultimately help you to become more comfortable and confident within them.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	Yes, see a shrink.|`|ojdAv6cuaa	most likely the reason you feel awkward is because you're scared of rejection. as a result you don't really show your true self and really put yourself out there. people like it when people do that, and if you dont take yourself too seriously and can laugh at yourself when you say something stupid they like that even more :). people find it easiest to laugh at those who make fun of themselves. and im sure you do have things to say.<br>  <br>  throw yourself into some social situations and promise yourself not to take anything personally. make your main objective to have fun (obviously easier said than done) and im sure you'll see progress and you'll be alot happier as a result.<br>  <br>  also, if the way you dress bothers you then find someone with a sense of style you like and imitate that. if it doesnt bother you, then you're just a cool, fly, comfortable dude, and be proud to rep your lack of style as a style in itself :P<br>  <br>  good luck compadre :) x|`|CU9CU6QIaa	no problem. just be yourself. don't change your behavior for others. if u want to get more friends use this tactics,  people always like those who respond to their actions. if they talk about any field just listen to them and  don't interrupt them and it will be nice if u can smile a bit. don't be disappointed you can find friends having similar characters like u.|`|0uSPPAb5aa	A doctor would help you to understand, what is making you this way.<br>  It sounds as if you have a lot of insecurities.

3dT7f39maa	Well the rumour is that if you are dreaming of falling, supposedly if you hit the bottom your dead. But I am pretty sure thats not true. To have nightmares or dream of falling means a vary of things, you being dead is certainly not one of them so don't get yourself panicked.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
ZqHqKDqEaa	The best revenge against someone that has wronged you is by killing them with kindness. Your ex friend might have been upset when she said those things to you, but after a heated argument things are said that cannot be retracted no matter how many times you apologize and say sorry. <br>  <br>  When you see her at the meeting, like the other person said, be cordial and smile. She's gonna be thinking why isn't he yelling at me. <br>  <br>  Or another option is to write her a letter, express all of your feelings, but don't mail it. This will enable you to get all of your thoughts off your chest.|`|nWXgWDqlaa	Well clearly you shouldn't let her (or he you didn't say), walk all over you if she starts having a go at you. But i dont think its a good idea to confront her, as this will just lead to another argument possibly. Just play it cool, and try and stay away from her, dont ignore her though if she looks at you, acknowledge her and smile or wave, if she engages you in conversation then maybe talk to her about whats happened.
AA10093245	According to this book I have called !0,000 dreams interpreted, a snow capped mountain means that your longings and ambitions will bring no worthy advancement, but climbing a mountain means you will overcome obstacles and reach your ambitions.|`|3dT7f39maa	We've all heard the saying, "Well, that's certainly a mountain to climb!" or "That's no hill for a climber." In our waking life, we view climbing a mountain as a challenge or obstacle to overcome. Our subconscious mind views mountains in a dream in the same way. So, if you are climbing a mountain in your dream, you are currently working on overcoming an obstacle in your waking life.

paerqxfMaa	I think it's a defense mechanism - if we can laugh about it, maybe its not so scary.  I know my friends and I make jokes or remarks regarding the most tragic things - even when we do it we say - "we shouldn't say that", "it's not nice" - but we say it anyway and share a laugh.  I guess that's just a human condition.|`|8miMWB64aa	Not really.  Sarcasm's pretty popular for sure.  There was a time when I was one of those people who did and said almost everything ironically.

AA11589988	Your premise could be false.<br>  When you say "Married down" you are talking about comparisons between educational attainment and not comparisons between income. Whilst there is a relationship between educational attainment and income it's not a clear cut one. <br>  So a lot of these educated women could still be marrying non-graduate men who earn more than they do and therefore still marrying up in the traditional sense.|`|WkLJI40baa	Eleanor, your question does not reflect realities.

Historically, men have married down and women up.|`|HvtTKS4zaa	It simply follows the fact that women are scoring much better today in nearly all fields of education ,leaving the guys far behind. Among graduates the percentage of women will even grow in future as we see girls′success in our schools, compared with the boys.<br>  Traditionally it was just the other way round:  men marrying down, and women up !<br>  It seems women are turning the tables now. This will have consequences for the question who will be leading in marriage and partnership in future.|`|BkleL3F4aa	Canada is quite a misandrist country and many of the women seek submissive yes men to work for them.<br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously though, trades men make more than most Uni educated people and so do people working in the oil industry, Canada are big drillers.<br>  <br>  There was talk of women "marrying down" in Australia a few years back, they weren't marrying down. They were marrying builders and playing the property market.<br>  <br>  I doubt they are marrying down in Canada, they are marrying well paid oil riggers.|`|8miMWB64aa	It's probably pretty strongly influenced by the graduation rates.  If every male college graduate married a female one, then that'd be 100% for males, but there would still be about 30% of the females left, so they could only be about 70%, having married every available male graduate already.|`|8OREBeRdaa	What happened to marrying for love? Ok, it sounds sappy but seriously.  Who gives a flying crap what 'formal' education the other person has?  I know people with degrees that can't get a job in their field and need 2-3 part time jobs to make ends meet.  There is book smart and street smart.  I'd rather be with someone who is street smart.  You can always learn book smarts, street smarts tend to be gained with life challenging experiences.<br>  <br>  Having a degree doesn't make one any less of a inconsiderate @$$hole / B&tch.|`|ZYp1AEspaa	You can do pretty well for yourself without a college degree if you are in the trades. These are male-dominated. Women without a college degree tend to be employed in positions that pay less. <br>  <br>  That's all I can come up with. It's just a thought.|`|DEc1C9hkaa	Maybe there are more women than men attending college, there are more men in trades and some trades pay as well as jobs requiring college degrees.<br>  <br>  I hate to think that marrying a laborer or a tradesman (woman/person) is marrying down.|`|vAdtlZDpaa	I don't know - I married "down" - LOL!!|`|iHKJsyfTaa	A university degree is not the determining factor in (( Up or Down ))<br>  <br>  There are plenty of losers with college degrees in subjects like Political Science, Philosophy and Women's and Gender Studies to marry<br>  <br>  There are lots of degrees that prepare one for absolutely no career at all..
xuDGrCSVaa	He said that you "had betrayed" your people, but you "had no idea" what he was talking about....Well at first impression one would think that I should tell you to try to get in-touch with your Indian roots and people....BUT in the dream they held you hostage and wouldn't let you get away(they are trying to control you).  So make sure that you remember the first part of your dream--the bathtub filled with water in an old house.  You have to know that you don't have to be held accountable for anything that your ancestors did.  You are your own person, only accountable for your own actions.  I think the bathtub is there to try to tell you that you need to "wash" yourself of the burden of whatever your ancestors did.  You don't owe them anything!!  you are your own person... and that goes for your mother too.  <br>  If you need any help with how to do this you can email me...deree83@yahoo.com.  But I gotta tell you that I am a Christian and I can only give you the Christian perspective.  :)|`|bMVJkCShaa	I would say that it's worth checking into your ancestry a bit more, try and get more information about where your family comes from, particularly the native american side.<br>  <br>  It could psychologically be an issue within yourself about knowing your part indian but have done nothing to learn more about it?
jIk2ttH1aa	Forgive her in your own heart.  You are a strong person, who doesn't need to stay stuck on her level.  <br>  If you bump into her, don't stare, but I wouldn't chat it up with her either.  Just look at her like she's a tree or invisible or part of the scenery and keep on moving.  If she stares at you, than turn your back on her so you don't see her starring.  <br>  She's an immature person who is obviously just trying to get a rise out of you and seek attention from others.  The longer you just let the rumors simmer down, and the longer she continues to be the way she is-- the easier it will be for people to see that she if full of crap.<br>  Whoever, whatever you are, focus on your inner beauty, and be happy with yourself, because we all have inner beauty it's just the choice to embrace it and practice putting it to use, or to choose the dark path as she did.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you!|`|6ygM407maa	so your a lesbian?
JsiELu6xaa	I dont think most men like to pay, i think its just what the world expects. I know I wouldnt pay all the time if I could do anything about it. But its not even something you discuss, you just do it.

Women earn money now.|`|5ewSifMraa	It is the man's job to pay for the date because they want to be the gentlemen and be nice and let the girl have a nice time without her paying for it.<br>  <br>  In some cases they would both split the check and in most places that's acceptable too.  Most girls these days are high maintenance so it would only be fitting that guys will have to pay for the dates.<br>  <br>  Which sucks if you ask me, since most guys need a better job to get more money.|`|9de68204fb68bbbc0e10fc5b9880ed2eaa	Why?<br>  1.

I personally enjoy to do it not because I want to show off money (hell I just got out of the military I'm not exactly rolling in it) but to show the lady that I am with that I care enough to buy her dinner.  It's just a simple gesture of kindness.  Also I see it as implied when you ask somebody to come to eat with you they kinda think it's a date and therefore you will pay.  I think that yes guys should pay for dates (unless you're together for a long time or married my wife and I is just whoever gets their card out first).  It is classy and respectable.  I think they should also open doors for the lady (to include the car door).  Of course I'm old fashioned and take my hat off indoors (even when not in uniform) and tip my hat when greeting a lady in passing.|`|qLBsTaDlaa	Should is one of my most hated terms. It implies absolutes to behavior in which there is no absolute. Maybe they pay out of habit or courtesy, and all I can say is - it is up to them, if I want to date someone who doesn't want to pay, we can go dutch or reverse the bills (I pay once he pays once) it really is not a huge issue to me (or if he's broke at the time I'll buy) It just depends on how much you like the person.|`|V1wDqlvnaa	it's not that they LIKE it, it's just the way "tradition" goes.<br>  <br>  men are supposed to "court" women and all that good stuff so payig for meals is a way to "impress" you i guess you can say.<br>  <br>  shoud they? well that's up to you, i personally wouldn't mind, now if things get serious and you go out more than a couple times i would offer to pay or to split the bill. it just depends really on the guy and/or situation|`|yuGW9AlCaa	I disagree with Rio.<br>  <br>  My husband actually enjoyed being able to treat me to a dinner out when we were dating.<br>  <br>  He didn't do it because he felt that he "had" to.. just like if I treat my little sister to lunch, it's not because I feel like I "have" to .. I do it because I'm glad she made time for lunch with me.. <br>  <br>  He knew that I appreciated it.. he also knew that I was very able to pay for my own food.. but allowing him to do something nice for me was a way of showing that I liked him.<br>  <br>  We never looked at it as who "had" to pay... maybe its because we both are blessed enough to have enough disposable income that it's not an issue.<br>  <br>  When we go out to dinner.. he still likes to get the bill.. and I don't mind not having to fool with it... I guess it's just our personalities.|`|3b81d471c44135bcc3043a49eca775e2aa	hahaha.. here r the explanation. .. (i m a man and dated tons of women.. and.. d.a.m...n it .. i know exactly why..)<br>  1) even thought the world is changing.. and how much exciting and fun the new technologies can be.. the man is still the man.. he still has his own pride (and he did unintentionally to show the woman he is dating that.. he can take care of everything..)... SIMPLY.. HE THOUGHT I M THE MAN .. SHE'S A WOMAN.. THAT'S WHY I VE TO PAY..<br>  2) well.. that depends.. if he insists.. don't deny it.. and that way u won't hurt his ego<br>  3) why? lets just say.. his pride of himself is something he value.. that ..he's the man.. and he can take care of everything.. and.. well.. as long as u get ur FREE FOOD.. why would u want to hurt his ego..?<br>  <br>  lol|`|AA11768256	Whoever does the asking does the paying.

zHmZkMStaa	Actually, it's a form of re-enforcement.  By finding others like you, you can stay stuck in your behavior.  Criminals do this.  It's a pack mentality.  HOWEVER; in a therapeutic, group setting, it's beneficial, in that a group of depressed patients - with the goal of getting better - can often assist each other,  and bring each other up and out of a depression.|`|pDptioSNaa	This is such a cruel question....

NAGiNKFWaa	Chase <br>  To dream that you are being chases, signifies that you are avoiding a situation that you do not think is conquerable. It is often a metaphor for some form of insecurity. In particular, to dream that you are chased by an animal, represents your own unexpressed and unacknowledged anger which is being projected onto that animal. Alternatively, you may be running away from a primal urge or fear.|`|zYGJh5Odaa	I don't now what is means.<br>  It could be a dream that is telling you that something bad will happen in the future.<br>  so always keep your eye's open at all times.|`|0uSPPAb5aa	Being chased in dreams is often a sign of feeling trapped or stuck. After yrs. it would be in your best interest to find out what exactly it means.<br>  Whatever it is its something in your subconscious that is bothering you or something that has happened to make you keep having them.<br>  I highly doubt that something bad is going to happen to you unless you are a criminal and have not been caught . If you are doing nothing that would provoke such dreams it might be worth talking to a person who specializes in dreams they have got to be dealt with to overcome them.
AA10471548	A Guess<br>  I guess the expected answer is C. psychoanalysts.<br>   <br>  Food for thoughts: Psychotherapy or in-depth psychology deals with the so-called unconscious. Yet, how could the "unconscious" produce intelligent "Freudian Slips," when it is unconscious? <br>  <br>  Freudian slips e.g. consist of truth uttered without conscious intent; truth, the conscious mind would not dare to express! That is, the so-called "unconscious" must have been conscious concerning the truth! <br>  <br>  For example, someone says to the neighbor, "What an awful dress!" instead of "awesome" dress. Being polite would have called for "awesome," yet, the true feeling of the person saying "awful" is expressed instead, without conscious intend and to the conscious embarrassment of that person. The "unconscious" must have been aware of the dress and how it was truly perceived<br>  <br>  Before making a statement about the "unconscious," I think common psychology has to define consciousness, which has not satisfactorily been done yet!<br>  <br>  Hope I hit the school mark!

Religious believes are so strong in different cultures, in different countries. I would say to my children and grand children that neither my grand father nor my father nor I have seen a ghost or spirit. <br>  It may be argued that these elements are not earthly or not material forms and so, they cannot be seen or touched. so be it that the reverse also cannot happen; ie: they cannot touch us also.<br>  <br>  The point is that only a material can do harm to another material, except wind or electricity. Ghosts/spirits cannot do any harm to human beings because we are solid materials. Don't worry about them.<br>  <br>  Another thing I would tell my children and grand children is that fear will destroy your creative ability and very many other capacities in you. Therefore, anything that frightens you must be eradicated from your mind immediately. Challenge the fear factor and reason it and you will be free of it. Believe in concepts that strengthen you, build you and replenish you but not to anything that weakens and blinds.|`|dec96041a9328ba9706ab620e51d3697aa	If Ghost is real, we can experience its presence.

AA10478980	You need to find a way to stop focusing on yourself and to focus on others, or other things.  The best way I can think of for you to do that is to start volunteering.  Volunteer at a soup kitchen, a homeless shelter, a shelter for battered women and children, or even at the animal shelter.  Seeing that there are people in much more dire straits than you are will help you realize that you really do have a good life and a promising future ahead of you and will help you count your many blessings instead of focusing on things that are superficial and really don't matter.  Volunteering can be a life changing experience.|`|1TPGdaXJaa	Confidence is beautiful.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	What got me out of it was learning to dance and then, something I could never even dream of doing, perform!

It could be hormones that are making you depressed, in which case, you just need to wait it out. An individual is always the most critical of their appearance. What you may see as a huge nose, others probably don't even notice. Use makeup as a way to flaunt your good points, rather than hide your bad ones. Even if you are hideously ugly, appearance isn't everything, and people who are worthy of being your friends will feel the same.|`|AA10572259	If you really feel that terrible then you need to find someone to talk to.  Maybe go into your doctor and see about being put on some medication to help your moods.  I do understand where you are coming from.  I felt a lot of the same way at your age.  I got a little better when I started dating but it didn't really fix itself (mostly) until I was in my 20s.  When I just came into myself and felt that I was who I was and that was not going to change.  If you hate your hair then go into a salon and have them perm or straighten or something it so you can see if it works better that way.  My hair is course and thick and I can't do anything with it.  There are times when I want to cut it all off and wear a hat, well except my head is too big for cute girlie hats.  Anyway maybe you need to find a hobby or something you are really into.  Its great that you have friends who can look past what you think you look like.  Have a good time with them, don't waste your teenage years worried about what you can't change.  Try to enjoy your life.|`|X4RAgJkUaa	I'm not even sure how to answer this one. <br>  You THINK you look bad, though I'm sure there's nothing wrong with you.<br>  So, change it.<br>  If you hate the way you are, you can do one of three things - either learn to accept it, change it, or just sit and stew in your own self-loathing.<br>  I'm sure you're not horridly disfigured, and even if you were, since when is physical appearance the only thing on earth that matters?<br>  <br>  Aside from all of that, you're only 17, hun.<br>  You'll live.<br>  Just look on the bright side of things, eh?|`|Y9eSvxzQaa	The most important thing is for you to love yourself.

It is obvious that you have low self esteem. You need to find out why. I know it is not the looks, it is something beyond that. Probably how people treat you, and maybe it has to do with your looks.  If people are offended about your looks...that is not your problem, it is theirs.  You can't let how people view you affect your life. As long as you do not mistreat others, you really can't let it get to you.  No matter how pretty or ugly someone may be, there are going to people who will not like the way you look or how you think, for no apparent reason.  That is just the way people are. Now for you, if anything had changed about you before you were born, you would not be you. You would be someone else with a different body, mind, and thoughts. You NEED to ACCEPT the way you are physically made, whether you like it or not and act as if you are the most beautiful and hottest person on earth, and people will start to look at you that way. Do you know how many ugly girls I see dress and act as if they are the "sh*t" and do get the most good-looking guys out there that some pretty girls is working harder to get.  And it goes the same for men.  You would be surprised of the power of good self esteem, acceptance and confidence. When you can do this for yourself, you will be able to do that for others. Do not let the dislike for your physical appearance consume you to the point where you are considering ending your life. You cannot put value on VANITY, especially to the point of such acts and thoughts.  If you believe in the Bible, I would recommend that you read Proverbs 31, the whole chapter.|`|GmF4iAFXaa	Open your mind and look at your inside. That is what the people who care about you do, I bet you are pretty. And never kill yourself, it raises more problems than it solves... for everyone else. <br>  And because you think you are ugly is never a reason to kill yourself...<br>  e.g.   I break mirrors, but I have friends and I am OK with life (for other reasons I don't love it) But my ugliness has nothing to do with it.<br>  It is a teen thing, you will get over it.<br>  No-one has said anything, so that means you are definitely not ugly!|`|a73lBDAGaa	dont worry about it. just be yourself! who cares about the size of your nose? people aren't gonna say "omg look at her she has a huge nose!" just don't freak out that's not gonna happen. and sometimes makeup can make a person look worse, just go without it sometimes. wouldn't youu rather have people see you as you and not as someone trying to cover themselves up? and the clothes, who cares whats in style or what other people are gonna think is alright, just go with YOUR style, wear what YOU want to wear, be yourself and don't worry about your looks or what other people think of it. you have friends because they like you the way you are and i'm sure theres many many many people out there with this same exact problem, it's not just you. so just do what you want and be yourself and don't worry what other people say cause it's just their opinion and it might be wrong, don't let it get to you. also if you're more confident, that will really help, confidence is the key, it will make you feel better and when you feel better you look better.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!! :]

iqZUd5Fdaa	There are leaders and there are good leaders. To simply be a leader you just need to be vocal and assertive, but to be a good leader you have to be intelligent, you have to appear calm and confident (but never arrogant) at all times, even if you dont feel it. You need a sense of humour, otherwise the pressures of being a leader will drag you down. You have to be excellent at communicating your thoughts, which doesnt mean you need to be loud or aggressive, you just have to speak clearly and be clear about what you mean. You have to listen carefully to everything people tell you, no matter who they are or how small the problem is. You have to posess the ability to put yourself in other people's shoes, understand how they feel, in order to help them.

You have to realize that blaming others who are trying to give you advice or guidance is a sociopathic tendency. You have to really ask yourself if you even wanted help to begin with, and try not to take it as too much of a personal attack.

NAGiNKFWaa	Holy cow, I have had a few like this.  If you are her supervisor, document everything and then get rid of her.  If you are not her supervisor, document everything and make sure her supervisor knows what is going on.  I had one lady so stupid, I had to write the training program to a third grade level and she still couldn't understand it.  I finally wrote a letter of counseling and wrote all the things I had issues with from not being able to follow simple instructions, to making mistakes that cost the company money, to making mistakes that other people had to fix for her, and then I had a section where she had to write what she was going to do to correct these things.  Her immediate supervisor would give her instruction, and 10 minutes later she would forget the instruction.  So I told her to write what she was going to do to improve herself and learn the job.  She had been in this job for over a year, and didn't have one raise, yet people hired after her had several raises.  She was hired by someone else, so I had to clean up this mess.  She ended up quitting because she couldn't think of anything she could do to learn the job, and I had written the training program at a third grade level, so there wasn't anything I could do to make anything easier for her, so she quit.  You really can't feel sorry for these people.  They accepted a job for a specific salary, and an employer has the right to expect them to do the job, or move on to some other kind of work.  Some people work well in factories where they can do jobs without thinking, and other people like jobs where they thrive under stress.  She just needed to find a job where she didn't have to think.  You need to fix it, or your boss does, but it isn't fair to you or to her to keep her in a job she isn't capable of doing.  There might be a different division where she might fit in, or she may just need to work someplace else.

However, generally (but not always) men are more obsessed with sex and pursue it more actively (or perhaps desperately!).<br>  <br>  2) Generally (but not always), sex means more emotionally to a woman than it does to a man, but that doesn't diminish the physical thrill. Women are also more guarded about who they sleep with because it has a greater impact on them. Personally I think sex has an inevitable power dynamic. The act of penetration is a dominant one, and the act of allowing it is a submissive one. I think that dynamic exists in even the most tender, loving sex acts. Even if I initiate sex with my husband, I am inviting him to dominate me in a way. Furthermore, women take greater risks when they have sex. Men, for example, aren't risking 9 months of pregnancy and several years of childcare when they have sex. And due to the nature of the exchange of body fluids, many STDs pass from man to woman more easily than from woman to man.<br>  <br>  3) Some women's sex drives are far stronger than some men's sex drives. Mine is ferocious!<br>  <br>  4) Women have orgasms. OH YES we do! And personally, I would never, ever fake one. What's the point?|`|PCsW0gbPaa	I think that women's sexuality is just tied up with some other stuff.<br>  First, there is a lot of societal expectation pushed on women about their sexuality (they are "sluts" or whatever) so they get worried about it.<br>  Second, women get penetrated.  That makes it a physical requirement for them to be at ease in order to enjoy themselves.  <br>  Third, women are normally attracted to men that are bigger and stronger than themselves.  Think about getting intimate with someone that could so easily beat you up.  It would be kind of scary.  So again, I just think that women naturally have to be more cautious and really trust a man before getting intimate.<br>  That said, once you get those preconditions out of the way (1. she's not worried about being condemmed for enjoying it.  2. She's relaxed and in the mood 3. She trusts her partner) then I think women are even more intensely sexual than men are.|`|ih4zOaDMaa	No sexuality and no orgasms? Think again. Nearly every woman can get a clitoris orgasm, otherwise - and I try not to blush here - what do you think dildos are made for? - for sexual pleasure if you're a lesbian or single girl.

If you don't want to contact them you could always ask at the Citizens Advice Bureau|`|4ec5baf736e5e1b4200f6e39ea8eda12aa	Yes I am afraid that's your problem as a pensioner or your families. If its your home you must pay for its upkeep and if you cannot and the Council has to take-over because of safety risks they can obtain a court order enabling them to sell your house or have a legal charge on it to cover the costs of making it safe. They could also move you to a Council run home and use the rest of your money to pay for it.  This is why families should look after one another young or old.
kynzqmWgaa	Girls definitely lie because they're insecure about everything..why do you think so many of them get plastic surgery.  That is the only reason girls say boys lie, because they lie.  They project their anger for being liars on anyone else...anything to get the attention off of them|`|S5vUEJ9Kaa	Its an Individual Problem not Gender type. <br>  <br>  It depends on a person and situation.

Emotional overflow from a recient break-up.  Generalizing is easy, even if untrue.
mUO3b0fQaa	Hey, I have the same problem or at least the second part "friends thing". If she really was your best friend she should have never let you go. Don't feel sorry for her, she isn't worth it. Look for someone else. And if you can't find anyone just go by yourself. Better alone than with bad company. As for the guy, he ain't the last on earth you would find someone else who appreciate you better and be REALLY into you. And remember nobody deserves your tears and who deserves them won't make you cry.<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|dd242da77f64ad0e25bb846806bd953caa	I would feel pretty down about it.  But as soon as you see one of the couples fighting or they complain to you about something their partner did, it will make you feel like " hey i'm glad i'm single and not worrying about this drama."  If you have good friends in life, life is good.  and when life is  good, good things will happen to you... whatever that may be...|`|AA11407645	Awkward!!!  But its only temperary so just relax.

AA11166769	Many years ago, I lost my virginity to a guy I believe was a sociopath. Thankfully, my time with him was very brief, but once when we had sex, he took off the condom without my realizing it, and when I saw the semen running down my legs afterwards, he claimed that it came from my orgasming. (I was too naive then to know better.) He basically used me for sex and treated me like sh*t. He also told me that many years before, he had been a psychiatric nurse, but that he had lost his job, because he was constantly late. He was very flippant about the whole matter when he discussed it, and I later read that a failure to fulfill obligations and a flippant manner are key marks of a sociopath. And not only that, but many years later, another guy I knew told me that he had once spent the night in jail with a guy who fit this guy's physical description. (The guy has a very distinctive burn scar on his chest.) I'm almost 100% certain that the guy he met in jail was the same guy who took my virginity, and I think that the fact that he has a criminal background is another sign that he is a psychopath.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Yes, my sister.  It's hard to briefly describe what it's like, but, basically, I have done a lot for her throughout her life, and, in return, she will sometimes just go totally ballistic and call me a "sociopathic b*tch."  She completely abuses my parents, especially my father, who is 78 years old and drives 45 minutes each way to this psycho's house to play board games with her and clean for her.  She cares nothing for anyone but herself.  My parents had to take a reverse mortgage on their house because she took whatever money they had set aside for retirement.<br>  She has alienated anyone who ever cared about her, including our mother and my other sister.  She keeps my father in line by threatening to kill herself, and he's terrified if he doesn't do everything she wants, she'll do that.  (This is, of course, the equivalent of a 5-year-old threatening to hold her breath until she turns blue.  It's not going to happen.)  <br>  We don't speak.  I actually sent her a Christmas gift and never got a thank you.  She'll accept my gift but doesn't want to speak to me to say thanks.  <br>  I guess the worst part is that she doesn't see herself for what she is.  Everyone else is wrong; she's always right.  Her life is a shambles, and she blames everyone else.|`|y3eY9x0kaa	my mother, she is a psycopath and a junkie druggie, she is a great person but has problems, people like that are off the wall, you never know to expect next and you will never guess what their next move it.. weird stuff.|`|ES15x7EIaa	Check out this blog:<br>  <br>  constructedcharisma.blogspot.com<br>  <br>  You might find it interesting.

Uj9cLwbpaa	Therapy helped me enormously. Find a good therapist.|`|kynzqmWgaa	Find what you like about yourself and compare whatever it is to other people.  When you realize that whatever you have is better than the next person maybe your confidence will improve.|`|v3n9LA2Haa	you can have a small wedding and if ppl fuss over you dont think they are doing you a favor think you are doing them a favor. ppl feel good for helping out at weddings and making sure the bride and groom have an easy time.<br>  <br>  you dont need any confidence since they should just be FRIENDS otherwise DONT invite them/dont let them do any major help things.<br>  organise as much as you can by yourself and with ppl you LIKe so it leaves less to fuss over.|`|CyjuTf0raa	I suggest maybe some therapy to help prepare yourself for the wedding.<br>  <br>  Also, do some small activities with your soon-to-be that you know you can accomplish, as this will build not only your confidence, but the confidence of the couple as well. This will help build a stronger bond that will make coping with the stress of planning (and executing) a wedding much easier.

Yes, they may be hot, and have money as well, but if you stop and think, they're only after your money.  Why would you want to be with someone like that?  I sure wouldn't, If I was a guy.  I mean, I don't know you, maybe you want that pick of women, but deep inside I don't think you would want to.  But did you ever ask yourself this...what would happen once you have that 5 million, plus the women, and all of a sudden, you lose all that money.  Where are the girls now?  Oh yeah, they're off with another millionaire.  Hmmmm. Think about it. =]|`|Y4s4Om38aa	You could have you pick of shallow women that only care about the money.

9VAnsWYUaa	I agree with you Holly.<br>  <br>  There's much unjustified bigotry/preconceived notions in the world. There's more unjustified bigotry/hatred of the US. Whoever is in control, or whoever thinks that they know too much will be and are despised. The gross misunderstanding of the regular American on the streets is unexplainable, unless we understand that the people from other countries think that the decisions of my leader are inherently my decisions. Do I support the war? No. Do I support the patronization that my politicians confer on other countries? No. Do I personally revel in calling Canada my masseuse? No. <br>  <br>  People should realize that my politicians/leaders do NOT necessarily represent my views however much they pretend to do so.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Oh, yeah.  Everybody seems to know the ins and outs of American society and our people.  They haven't the slightest clue.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Undoubtedly. But it also seems like a lot of Americans are clueless about life in other countries. Like, say, Canada, even though we are neighbors.<br>  <br>  I think it is human nature not to understand things that are different from what we are used to. And also....it's hard to have an accurate idea of life in a country you've never visited.|`|iHKJsyfTaa	Of course they do !, People in other countries ( I'm Sure) believe the asinine behavior and actions of the Govt. is some how representative of the wishes of its citizens.|`|YkseyT7zaa	I sure everyone has an interesting perception of places they have never been.|`|ZjCurM7saa	My mom is a foreign national and I have family living in another, rather liberal, country. My cousin told me that America deserved 9/11 for reelecting Bush in 2004. It seems to me that their impression is built up by their local media which tends to be anti-American.<br>  <br>  Note that I've seen an anti-American attitude that preceded Bush and Iraq because of America's resistence to left-wing policies (at least relative to other countries thus far). I don't think it's based on American media, because they seem to like American movies and such. It mostly seems to be based on ignorance of America coupled with a political objection that is magnified by America's success.<br>  <br>  I remember being told, when I was about 10, by an older cousin that America is not a good country because it "has no culture". Note that this is a South American country...Not a European one.<br>  <br>  ProfessorC: The "reasoning" seemed to be centered around the Iraq War and that Americans were responsible for Al Queda's attacks there by reaffirming Bush as our president. I've lived in and travelled to 4 different continents in my life and I've found that anti-American sentiment is not isolated and is not the result of Bush. Bush was an excuse to bang the drums a bit louder.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Most western folks have american life imposed on them through the media anyway in the form of films & 'sitcoms'. <br>  <br>  I've lived in USA, so I do have some room to talk. <br>  <br>  I liked some of it - and I disliked some of it.<br>  <br>  <br>  I like than I could turn right on a red light, seemed to save conjestion.<br>  <br>  I dislike that it promotes sexism in the form of VAWA, promoting myths and derogatory stereotypes of half the population.|`|Wrf5orAuaa	Most people only see life in the US as depicted in TV series and movies. this naturally skews their opinion of what the rest of the US is like. It comes with the territory of having so much entertainment depiction set in the US. Just like with celebrities who complain about their image, people believe what they see on TV. It may be all rubbish, but it's what is depicted|`|84gK4XlHaa	Every time I've been abroad, the people have mostly been very nice.  I spent a lot of time in Germany, and with the exception of the NPD, the people there really like some bits of American culture.  Prejudice and bigotry is everywhere, but most people who claim not to like Americans actually mean that they don't like our foreign policy or our leaders.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	I know which one you are referring to, and ive seen a few answers by that one, and they are all anti american. So, its an anti american troll, thats all.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Yeah, I do. A lot of people I know say really negative things about the U.S. without attempting to actually learn about it. I used to be guilty of that.|`|HQKuzxulaa	The above is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Foreign policies  (Wars) and leaders.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Well, there are things that I hear about the USA that I find definitely alarming, like your lack of adequate healthcare and your habit of going around sueing each other at the drop of a hat.  And the ease with which people can apparently acquire guns and shoot each other.  And the current neurosis about smoking is very tiresome (though we seem to be getting that way here as well)<br>  <br>  On the other hand, like everybody else I watch American films and TV, read American books, and take my children to Macdonalds, and my husband drinks Starbucks coffee by the gallon.  Many good things have come out of America.  And most of the American people I have talked to, whether in real life or on the Internet, have been perfectly charming.<br>  <br>  Like every other nation, you have good things and bad things.|`|dmCyY2SKaa	It's true, most people around the world have no idea what the US is really like and how Americans really live. They look at American movies, television, etc and their own media's propaganda and have this topsy turvy view of what the US is really like. It's trendy to hate on Americans and it's an acceptable, politically correct prejudice. <br>  <br>  Celtish is a typical hypocritical Brit. Trying to wash away his former empire's sins by blaming everything on the US. It's amusing, even the notion that the UK is in any way innocent. If we are to be defined by our leaders and government, then I'll define you by your leaders and government and history, as well. I'll define you by your former tyrannical empire and your current fascist, Big Brother state.<br>  <br>  "Being a Brit, I am one of your former colonial masters but I do not begrudge you your independence." And then he goes on to say, "I am not happy with your country's warmongering policies and empire-building". LOL.

In the last few generations we really have come to regard it as our God given right to consume 25% of the world's resources even though we are only 5% of the population. Our last administration prosecuted an illegal war of aggression that has de-stabilized the world and killed hundreds of thousands of people and the most your average American has done in protest is laugh at a snarky John Stewart joke. We ignored the crooked, ponzai scheme that our stock market has become and as a result every economy on the planet is suffering.

BS2dgOIWaa	You don't have to stop missing your childhood. You don't have to accept the fact that you're getting older. You're no longer a child, but try not to think of yourself as "aging". It's depressing just to use that term. Think of yourself as who you are and whatever age you feel that you are and don't worry what others think about this.

HlxjmFh0aa	I hope I have room for all the differences... this is an excerpt from the below listed link.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Neanderth..." rel="nofollow">http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Neanderth...</a><br>  Cranial: Braincase and face <br>  The average brain volume has been estimated at 1520cc, larger than the 1350cc of modern Homo sapiens.  Endocasts point toward Neanderthal dominance on the cerebral, indicating the right and left spheres of the brain were specialized, in line with modern humans. <br>  A relatively large face that is forwardly situated and characteristically has midfacial prognathism, as if it is being pulled forward by the nose. <br>  Cheekbones are swept back behind a large and open nasal cavity. They feature triangular peninsulas of bone that project into the nasal opining from both sides, increasing the surface area on mucus-producing membranes that, research suggests, aide in warming and humidifying the cold and dry air associated with the tundra environment of Neanderthals. <br>  On the rear of the skull is what is commonly referred to as an "occipital bun" where an increase in bone surface area allows for more muscle attachment. It is at this point where certain neck muscles anchor into pits, the supeainias fossae. This adaptation leads to increased power in the neck and shoulders. <br>  Large, double arched bony brow ridges above the orbits. The brow ridges are functionally linked to the retracting forehead, as the forehead becomes less and less vertical, the brow ridges become necessary in order to absorb the heavy stress generated in the face during chewing. <br>  Dentition: Specialized chewing apparatus Cranium and mandible from Shanidar Cave displaying classic Neanderthal characteristics.Very large incisors with reduced size in the rest of the dentition, also evidence of scraping animal and plant material against front teeth, leading to heavy wear. This labial wear has been hypothesized to be due to Neanderthals holding animal hides in their teeth while cutting, scraping or processing them. <br>  Upper incisors built up by ridges on the side, "shovelled" or described as shovel shaped.  <br>  Taurodont post canine dentition resulting in an enlarged pulp cavity and fused roots that are not independent of one another. <br>  The back teeth often have additional cusps and taurodont ("bull-toothed") roots  produced by a delayed turning-in of the roots during dental formation. This results in the molars being poorly or only slightly separated from each other. <br>  Very powerful musculature for a forwardly placed jaw. Increased mastoid tuberosity where temporal muscles attach on each side of the skull towards the rear of the braincase. The posterior temporal muscles aide in the use of the front teeth, hypothesized to increase productivity of scraping with the front teeth, thought to be very important to Neanderthal culture. <br>  A retromolar gap between M3, the last molar, and the ascending mandibular ramus, the extension of the jaw bone. <br>  A bony prominence next to the mandibular foramen, the hole that admits the mandibular nerve from the brain. This relates to the attachment of the sphenomandibular ligament which suspends and rotates the lower jaw, playing a role in stabilizing a large jaw during muscle actions. <br>  Below the neck"<br>  -Large shoulder and elbow joints <br>  -Large and wide rib cage *(Neanderthal had an "A" shaped rib cage, while Sapien has a "V" shaped rib cage)<br>  -Long clavicle <br>  -Wide scapula with more muscle attachments at the rear <br>  -Bowed and short forearm leading to a strong gripping hand with wide fingertips. <br>  -Wide hips with an outwardly rotating, large hip joint <br>  -Rounded, curved and thick-walled femur shaft <br>  -A relatively acute angle between the shaft and neck of the femur when compared to modern Homo sapiens <br>  -Large and thick patella (knee) <br>  -Short and flattened, thick-walled tibia <br>  -Large ankle joint <br>  -Wide and strong toe bones <br>  <br>  Unlike all of these features which follow a trend of increased muscle attachment and wider bones, the superior pubic ramus, the upper-front part of the pelvis, is much more gracile than expected. Being relatively long, thin and flattened, it had been suggested that it may have increased the birth canal to assist a small bodied mother birth a large headed infant, the large brain size needing a longer gestation period. But since this feature is also found in male specimens, it is believed to have widened the pelvis at the front to assist in rotating the blades of the pelvis outward along with the hip joint.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Due to the differences in the scapula (shoulder blade), many hypothesize that the Neanderthal had limited spear throwing ability and thus was forced to kill game at close range by thrusting with a spear.<br>  *(added to the referance material by me.)|`|H7L66ynJaa	Different skulls, different stance when standing, Neanderthals had more hair.

They can be and are more vicious than men can be.  There are a lot of negative aspects about women, just as many as men have, but their different.  They can be just as vicious, back-stabbing and cruel.  The biggest difference is they are passive about it, compared to mens aggression.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Your interpretation is sound and correct.

1fruneZ1aa	You seem to harbor a lot of resentment about who pays for dates. Dating<br>  is supposed to lay the ground for a possible relationship- which could lead<br>  to marriage. It's not about how many times do I pay in order to get l@id.<br>  Dating isn't synonymous with prostitution. If you're having financial difficulties and you really like a woman, just be straight with her. If she's<br>  a keeper, she'll understand and offer to contribute. If not, then move on. But really, the problem is not about money- it's about your attitude toward<br>  money and women in general.|`|NV3eIjLcaa	I thought it was beyond obvious that women are in no way interested in what is fair to men?<br>  <br>  (But believe me when I say this, no woman has an aversion to paying, NONE. It's all about game; the amount a guy pays is inversely related to his lack of game. If you have the game and are desirable enough she will most certainly pay to go out with you [or give into your demands of her, and perhaps both])<br>  <br>  - Fallen, this was just an example. Another would be the dating habits of the stereotypical fat woman who wants to date attractive men. Fat women are notorious for 'spoiling' their men, and there is little question as to why.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	I think it someone is so obsessed with the science and philosophies of dating and going out and referring to things like the game and rules he wont get any dates. Just see someone you like have fun and enjoy being with them.|`|LR48Rtv2aa	I agree with what the poster above me said.  I do think men over analyze the actions of women.|`|8OREBeRdaa	I do agree with your 3rd paragraph.  There are some inconsistencies.  On one hand, feminists say they want equality in everything - yet on the other hand they say for guys to pay for everything.  This is quite confusing to the point of almost being hypocritical.  What is the the convention here?  So from what I'm reading, the official rule of dating is that the guy HAS to pay for the first 2 dates?  Where is this written?  How is that equality?  Now I can see how some people will say that may be a bit petty and that someone who "can't pay, shouldn't play".   But what if you just want to go on a date with someone because you think they're a great person.  Just because you want to go on a date with someone doesn't mean you want to marry them, it also doesn't mean you want to sleep with them either (contrary to popular belief not all guys are lead around by their d#cks).  <br>  <br>  The rest of this question comes off as pretty sexist though.  What I'm trying to illustrate is that there needs to be some consistency.  Ladies if you set a guideline, then I'll follow it - just don't change the rules<br>  <br>  Jaron - How can you base your opinion about gender-bias on, of all things, People's Court?

When you are dating a woman the woman is looking for someone that she could potentially spend the rest of her life with.  If you can't afford to take her on two dates then your not worthy of her time.  Women expect the man to be able to provide.  Once you are together then it will be acceptable for her to pay every once in awhile.  If you can't afford to date, don't.  Wait till you can.

A group we are meant to connect with in both the spirit world, and here by choice in physical form. This is our soul group.<br>  <br>  The group could be you, and one other person, or several people. Our spirit guides are also part of our soul group.<br>  <br>  People from our soul group come into our lives at seemingly random times, but in fact these meetings were prearranged between us in spirit before we came here.<br>  <br>  We agree to connect and enable each other to learn a lesson or many lessons depending on how long we have arranged to be in each others lifetime. This is why some people are only fleetingly but intensely involved in our lives, then move on.<br>  <br>  Maybe you have felt a connection when you met someone for the first time, a feeling like you have known them forever,” an instant rapport?<br>  <br>  Even the use of the internet has brought soul groups together, so feeling a connection with someone on the other side of the world is not so strange.<br>  <br>  However, meeting someone on the same path is not quite the same as meeting someone in your soul group, there is a difference in the intensity of feeling.<br>  <br>  So how do we recognise someone from our soul group?<br>  <br>  Well, another soul group member speaks the same language spiritually. We recognise their energy, not their appearance.<br>  <br>  You feel like you met somewhere before (but know you didn’t).<br>  <br>  You could find yourself finishing each others sentences, or having the same ideas at the same time, on the same subject, out of the blue.<br>  <br>  Verbal or other forms of communication often overlap, e.g. phone calls, e-mails...<br>  <br>  Quite often you will feel a pull towards that person which surpasses any emotional connection you could possibly have built up in the short time you have known them. It is important to remember it will always be felt reciprocally if they are a truly a member of the same soul group. This is no excuse for fixating on someone who clearly does not want to know!<br>  <br>  You have an awareness when you are around this person that you are going through something important together that will make you even more spiritually aware when that journey comes to an end.<br>  <br>  Do you recognise anyone in your life now or in the past who belongs to your soul group? Think about those people who have created these feelings in you, and even if they are no longer in your life today, think about what knowing them this time around taught you.<br>  <br>  Whether we have good or bad experiences with them doesn't matter - there is great value in all of the experiences you will have had as a result of knowing each other again in this lifetime!|`|R39zpV2Gaa	You probably have seen him before or<br>  <br>  A chemical reaction in your brain caused you to think that you met him before.<br>  <br>  It happens to me all the time, it's random but when i get the chemical reaction, I feel like i have already lived that moment but i actually didnt.|`|WfJCvWkyaa	This is what the old folks used to say is "Love at First Sight" or it could your potential soul mate you never really know what god has planned for us and this person may be in his plan for you.

While "good" and "right" are theoreticall supposed to be - and to mean -  the same thing, we often have to examine those values closer to determine their true nature.  <br>  Our inner feelings are an excellent guide, if we would just remain aware of them and follow them - ESPECIALLY  when what feels "good" conflicts with what what fells "right".  Whenever we choose what feels "good" OVER and AGAINST what feels "right", then we usually end up feeling very "BAD"!<br>  <br>  It is NOT necessary to live in a cycle of temporary pleasure followed by hurtful regret.  There are PLENTY of things out there that ARE - and FEEL - both "good" AND "right" if you just look for them.  However, overindulgence, thoughtless sexual promiscuity, laziness and poor dietary habits are NOT among them.

mVTGl6HGaa	There is a great deal of debate about whether or not synesthesia can be identified through historical sources. A small number of famous people have been labeled as synesthetes on the basis of at least two historical sources. This includes individuals of many different talents, such as artists, novelists, composers, musicians, and scientists. For more details, and supporting evidence, see the main list of people with synesthesia.<br>  <br>  Artists with synesthesia include the painter David Hockney, who perceives music synesthetically as colors, and who used these synesthetic colors when painting stage sets, but not in creating his other artworks.[73] Also, Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky had the same type of synesthesia (sound and color). Perhaps the most famous synesthete author was Vladimir Nabokov, who had grapheme → color synesthesia, one of the most common types, which he described at length in his autobiography, Speak Memory, and which he sometimes portrays in giving his characters synesthesia.[74] Composers include Duke Ellington (timbre → color),[75] Franz Liszt (music → color),[76] Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov,[77] and Olivier Messiaen, who had a complex form of synesthesia in which chord structures produced synesthetic colors.[78] Notable synesthete scientists include Richard Feynman. Feynman describes in his autobiography, What Do You Care What Other People Think?, that he had the grapheme → color type.[79] The European record-holder for number of digits of pi recited, Daniel Tammet, has synesthesia, and claims to use his ability to "see" and experience numbers as spatial objects, textures and tones to perform advanced mathematical calculations in his head.[80][81] Other notable synesthetes include musicians John Mayer and Patrick Stump; actress Stephanie Carswell; and electronic musician Aphex Twin, who claims to be inspired by lucid dreams as well as synesthesia (music → color). The classical pianist Hélène Grimaud has the condition as well. Although this has not been verified, Pharrell Williams of the hip-hop production group The Neptunes and band N.E.R.D. claims to experience synesthesia,[82] and used this concept as the basis of the N.E.R.D. album Seeing Sounds.<br>  <br>  Some of the most frequently mentioned artists in connection with synesthesia probably were not synesthetes. Analyzing compositions such as Prometheus: The Poem of Fire and Mysterium, some researchers argue that the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin was most likely not a synesthete.[83] The synesthetic motifs found in Scriabin's compositions – most noticeably in Prometheus, composed in 1911 – are developed from ideas from Isaac Newton, and follow a circle of fifths.[83] Others have argued that Scriabin, besides his personal synesthetic perceptions, had developed a universal system that associated colors to musical keys, which was based on the literature and meant for public performances.[84] As an artist, he was particularly interested in the psychological effects on the audience when they experienced sound and color simultaneously. His theory was that when the correct color was perceived with the correct sound, ‘a powerful psychological resonator for the listener’ would be created. On the score of Prometheus Scriabin wrote next to the instruments separate parts for the color organ.[13]<br>  <br>  The French Romantic poets Arthur Rimbaud and Charles Baudelaire wrote poems which focused on synesthetic experience, but were evidently not synesthetes themselves. Baudelaire's Correspondances (1857) (full text available here) introduced the Romantic notion that the senses can and should intermingle. Baudelaire participated in an experiment with hashish by the French psychiatrist Jacques-Joseph Moreau and became interested in how the senses correspond in perception. [13] Rimbaud, following Baudelaire, wrote Voyelles (1871) (full text available here) which was perhaps more important than Correspondances in popularizing synesthesia, although he later admitted "J'inventais la couleur des voyelles!" [I invented the colors of the vowels!].<br>  <br>  Sean A. Day, a synesthete, and the President of the American Synesthesia Association, maintains a list of people with synesthesia, "pseudosynesthetes," and individuals who are most likely not synesthetic, but who used synesthesia in their art or music.

I don't think men and women are designed to be equal in every way. Instead, their differences are meant to complement each other.

Women like sex, too (at least they do the way I do it) and are just as entitled to seeking pleasure as men are.  <br>  With birth control and knowledge nowadays we all have found a way to enjoy sex without always paying a heavy cost.  So people do have sex more casually.<br>  But I don't think men are solely motivated by access to sex.  In my opinion, guys that are deadbeats would be deadbeats whether or not they are getting laid.  There are probably only a handful of men that are driven to success by their libidos.  (I believe admiration and relationships are a more frequent driver, but I don't think that has anything to do with "giving away the milk")<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Right now I've got 5 thumbs up, and no thumbs down.... and I'm about to sabotage it.  <br>  I guess in the specific case of women who have children and then complain that the father is a loser...

In that case, yes, the woman has no one to blame but herself for not expecting her mate to show some sense of responsibility before hooking up with him.  I  No matter how good of a mom she is, it's also her fault the kid doesn't have two good parents.  We can agree that the guy is a loser, but the woman shares the blame for making him a dad. <br>  It's like the old parable about the frog that takes the scorpion across the river.

Like if someone punches me, and I take a bat to their head. That is not self-defense. For me: I am 6'2", weigh 250, bench press ~300 lbs, and I box (and my boxing coach saysin addition to being a powerful puncher, I punch fast for my size, so work out the physics...). I would probably kill a 100 lb woman with a well-placed punch. The reverse would not be true. When is the last time you heard about a woman breaking down a door? Men do it. That is _typically_ a lot of power compared to the average woman. That being said, I did watch my female neighbor push her husband out the door and onto the ground once and lock him out.

The double wammy is when you see a white girl knock the hell out of a black guy on a basketball court because it defies two stereotypes at one time.  Abuse isn't funny but it's human nature to laugh at a woman throwing a haymaker. Now if it's a constant pattern of abuse rather than the one shot knock outs you see on youtube then it's not funny any more.   This isn't a p.c. answer. The correct thing to say is that it's never funny when a member of either gender hits the other.

Having objects thrown at one, or being pushed downstairs, can cause serious harm -- but it isn't only the physical harm that hurts the victim.<br>  <br>  F-on-M domestic violence doesn't get the attention it should. Many who think of women hitting men do assume it doesn't do any harm; men are generally ashamed to say it does; people laugh at them.<br>  <br>  I heartily agree with you: violence is violence; violence is wrong. I would love to see domestic violence treated more accurately, and society reach out to male victims, as it's trying to do with female victims.<br>  <br>  Most victims feel shame, but there's an added layer of shame for men, since they're expected to not be hurt, physically, by a woman.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I've seen this first hand. Sadly the thought is that women are the 'weaker sex' and therefore a man hitting a woman is akin to your kicking the dog or hitting a baby. But when a woman hits a man its seen as something he can take because he should be a strong man and besides how hard could a woman hit him? It's really a backwards and wrong way of thinking.

81BTYiWqaa	We have the capacity to nurture our dumb and crippled. So they survive and procreate - see lawyers|`|NZG8qODVaa	There are several issues with your question:<br>  1. None of the three traits mentioned--excepting 'crippled' which I guess could cover mentally and physical handicapped peoples--are really biological. We are, as people, all born as tabulae rasa, or blank slates. Laziness is a learned trait. Intelligence depends on you're method of measurement: an auto mechanic might not be able to discuss quantum physics, or speak five languages, but he understands the intensely complicated mechanics of a  modern automobile.<br>  2. Social Darwinism has been dead as a viable theory since at least the mid 20th century, though it does rear its ugly head from time to time. Franz Boas was one of the pioneers of disproving it along with eugenic theories. Natural selection by its definition selects for those traits which best allow the the SPECIES to survive, not the individual. Furthermore, as Jay Gould discussed, there is no real plan, or goal for evolution. It just happens. Genes mutate, and successful mutations get passed on, but completely useless mutations, like blue eyes and webbed toes, or multiple digits, get passed on as well.<br>  Trying to apply evolution to culture and/or society just doesn't work. Human beings have a strong tendency to act against their own biological self interest for a large number of unquantifiable reasons: religion, compassion, hate, love, nationalism etc.  Social Darwinism, was in essence, an attempt to use science as an excuse for  genocide, racism, and classicism. Think about this if Hitler had succeeded in his "Master Race Theory" , what would have happened to all those blond haired, blue eyed, Aryans with the rise in todays skin cancer rates, which place fair skinned and haired peoples at highest risk ? Theoretically--assuming no man made protective agent--those Aryans would eventually have turned darker and darker as those with more melanin production lived stood a better chance of reproducing.  Social Darwinism is nothing more than a misunderstood, non valid,  application of scientific theory.|`|xRimEBNgaa	This ignores genetic recombination and mutation. Many of the disabled are so because of mutations to their genetic code, what we refer to as birth defects. Others may have a certain combination of their parent's DNA that woven together produces a new deficiency unseen in the previous generation. But remember, even if humanity as a whole were becoming smarter, there would still be dumb among us who aren't really dumber than their parents, they just didn't get any smarter. <br>  <br>  But this serves a social function. There's nothing better than contempt for someone who seems worse off when it comes to bonding a couple people together. People identify what they are like by identifying what they are not like. If I see someone like the bachelor acting stupidly, I can bond with others like me who agree that he's acting stupidly. This gives me a sense of who I am, and is part of why we'll always have dumb, lazy racists too.|`|3XZX5Mj6aa	I doubt it. You see, laziness is probably something that has been more recently socially inherited; it's not really a physical trait that can be bred out. As for being crippled, if it was something that the person was born with then (thousands upon thousands of years ago!) they may have had more trouble surviving long enough to breed, but that doesn't stop accidents from happening after the person is beyond a sexually mature age. (Lamarck's theory doesn't come into play.) Also, apparently healthy people may have carried genes that would ensure offspring were physically or mentally handicapped in some way.<br>  As for stupidity, well, survival skills and stupidity may be different things.<br>  Of course, we are treating humans like animals here and are forgetting that complex social communities existed, and that lame or stupid family members may have been supported.|`|zQrINPwQaa	"No more so than evolution could "weed-out" compassion, tolerance or individuality; none of these are survival traits either."

There would have to be a process which would result in their failure to procreate.  As far as I can tell, "dumb, crippled, and lazy" folks reproduce without too much difficulty.  As well, you assume that these characteristics are genetically determined, which is not always the case.  And/or that constant and random genetic variability would not continue to produce these varieties of individuals. At one time in human history, these types of traits and others, such as blindness may have led to a failure to survive childhood.  That certainly is not the case at present.  Human society has evolved where the norm is to look after our progeny, regardless of any real or perceived disability.  We don't exactly throw the weak to the wolves anymore.

I wanted to get away from the house. My husband was at work and if I stayed home I would of had to answer the phone all day to greet Happy Birthday well wishers. My daughter lives across the yard from me but I did not want to do any thing with any one. So I ran away from home for the day. <br>      I went to our local park. It was a beatiful warm day. I went to the local store and bought some crossword games and magizines. I bought a few snacks and at the park I sat and watched the kids play. You can get a favorite book. I did bring my bible and read it also. <br>     When it was lunch, I went to Burger King and got me something to go and went back to the park for a nice lunch. Believe it or not, but I never go any where alone. So it was a big change for me. <br>     At a certain time I went to the movies, this was to end my day, I never go to the movies so it was a treat for me. The movie was not so good but my day was the best Birthday that I've ever had. Encluding going out with my husband to a nice resturant. I just needed some me time. If I find my self in the same spot this year, I will repeat . I might repeat once a moth where the weather permits. <br>     I hope I've given you some thoughts on how you can personalize your day. It don't take much money to just reflect on your life, away from home, and almost every town has one or two parks.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Get a couple of friends go bowling or to the movies or do both.

RPd66ldYaa	YES. My friend's niece died. She was just 7 years old and really had a resemblance to my son. We had a language barrier, as I was living in Thailand with my son (we're americans) and I was really connected to her and the family. So she underwent a brain surgery to remove a tumor. The first surgery seemed to be successful but months later I saw her with a deformed head and regrowth. I had a feeling deep down that she wouldn't survive the 2nd surgery, and she didn't. Several weeks after her funeral she came to me in a very realistic dream. She was speaking to me in English, floating around and very healthy and beautiful. I asked her in the dream if she would look out for my son (who was then 3) because we were foreigners in Thailand and I wanted him to be ok in adjusting to the culture and schools there. I said something like, "You're thai and understand the culture here, can you keep an eye on him?" and of course she sweetly said she would. Then I woke up and had that on my mind for a while.It was very real and clear and made me feel better to see her healthy.|`|a9i8Q98Aaa	About a week after my dad died I had a really lucid dream where her wasn't dead.  I went into the living room and he was watching the Yankees game with my brother and when I asked him why he wasn't dead, he told me I must have just had a bad dream.  I remember my mom cried when I asked her why it wasn't true.<br>  <br>  I once had a sex dream about Gregory Peck though, that wasn't too depressing.|`|CuVnpxh3aa	I often dream about people who have died or people who are going to die. I have psychic visions. I've had them since I was 3 y/o. Sometimes I can prevent the death if I tell the person to see a DR and what is wrong with them. I dreamed my Dad died (10 years ago) from a heart attack. I called him and told him to go see a heart Dr because something was wrong with his heart. My family all knows I see things. My Dad went to a cardiologist and found out he had 5 blockages. He is still going strong, he will be 80 in June. He had the blockages fixed within a week of when I told him. I also saved my Uncle's life when I told my Aunt I saw him dead. She burned the suit he was getting buried in and he is still going strong at 83 years old. I "see" things and always have.|`|yuGW9AlCaa	I dream about a friend from high school quite often.  She died when we were sixteen.  She was in a car wreck.<br>  <br>  She always looks just like I remember her.. usually in practice clothes for marching band.. and with her hair the exact way I remember her wearing.. <br>  <br>  We talk.. I know fully that she is dead.. but for some reason, I don't fear talking with her.. like I don't see her as a zombie or anything.. lol<br>  <br>  We just chat, and I give her updates on my life and usually tell her how much I miss her.. <br>  <br>  I generally wake up in tears, but it's good to at least THINK I'm getting to talk to her.|`|84gK4XlHaa	Not about someone who was already dead.

My brother and I cross the Swiss border into Germany, without realizing it. When we realize our mistake and want to go back, we're pursued by the army, and we hide amongst kids in a nearby school. We're later let go by Der Führer, when we give him some of our chewing gums.<br>  <br>  The dream was so live/colorful and fantastic that I didn't want to wake up even when I hear my phone ringing.|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	Yes I had a dream about my cousin who was murdered, in the dream he appears all freaked out, and I ask him "can you believe how these people are acting",(his friends started acting weird after this occurred and tried to paint my cousin out to be a completely different person in order to save their own butts, it was awful). and hes like "I know", and I hugged him and he felt cold. <br>  <br>  It was a really strange dream, as I do not often have these sorts of vivid dreams!|`|nhZb43pIaa	Yes, I regularly dream about my mother who is no longer alive.

xgrNAwa1aa	I agree that the way we are brought up by our parents and extended family does play a huge role in who we become later in our own lives.<br>  My example is I had two parents that were married but divorced when I was only 4. I never had a great relationship with my Dad even though he lived 30 minutes away because after the divorce he made it clear that his life was more important than raising his children. <br>  Because of this in my teens I searched high and low for a then man-child and later older men to compensate for my loss of not having my Dad around. I was abused and allowed it for fear of losing someone or getting a divorce. <br>  By my late 20's I was done with "falling in love" as I only kept getting hurt but it was my choices that hurt me. Of course that took me about 10 years to figure out. <br>  Now I do not feel marriage is a necessary part of being in love and having a life long partner. I am a Christian but still hold that one belief that maybe marriage is just not for me. <br>  I have a male friend who because of going through the same thing and watching his own parents divorce in his early teens never wants to get married. I can't say I blame him. <br>  Genetics even go as far as dictated how your life in general can turn out. For example in my family on my Dad and Mom's side most of the family members going back at least 3 generations or more became disabled before age 40. I was in an auto accident at 31 years old and have lived with chronic pain ever since that took my career away. <br>  At the time I had no idea so many other family members ended up disabled in one way or another earlier on in life until it happened to me. I was amazed at the number of people on both sides of the family were not able to work by age 40 or younger. My Mother is the only one I know of who never became disabled.<br>  Is this a coincidence? I think not. <br>  More than just things that happen in life can genetically dictate our future thoughts and outcomes in life. Hopefully we can grow from it and not be the people who came before us by changing ourselves if possible.|`|juG7X5gyaa	Genetics are a very strong part of who we are.  My parents were so much in love with each other, and yet I've had two failed marriages. I expected marriage to be like my parent's marriage.  <br>  Environment plays a part in who we are also. If your parents didn't marry, you can't help but think why should you?  For happy couples, it's a commitment to something greater than yourself.|`|4eLLjTzzaa	I believe all of that is true.  But it isn't all that is true.  We don't have control over what others do to us when we're children, and we can't do anything about the gene pool, but we CAN take responsibility for who we give our time and our selves to as adults and we ARE responsible for our behavior irregardless of our past.  There are ways and means to address, challenge, and change ourselves and we are responsible to be the best we can be.|`|1nL6p8zMaa	Absolutely!  Isn't that obvious?
fKiBi5fYaa	nothing is a disorder unless you think it is, you want it to be, or everyone else forces it upon you.  It sounds to me like you are very much an introvert.  I am not, but I understand your feeling.  It may be very difficult to work or succeed in the world without having good relationships with people, but it can be done.  I have met some very rich very weird hedge fund managers who spend almost all their time with numbers.  If you like the way you are, if you can work it, that's good, but never suffer to live in a way you don't like.  If you want to be more of a people person, get out there and try it.  I think that's probably a good idea anyway now and every once in awhile, just so you don't get stuck in the mental trap of being who you have been, or who you think you have to be.    <br>  <br>  One more thing: maybe the people you hang out with are not inspiring to you.  Consider making a huge change in your life, or at least in your social group.|`|XQvWFzcnaa	Anti-Social Disorder.<br>  Go to the doctor and check it out, see if it is something if you can.|`|Xu4x19y6aa	You don't have to be social. If you prefer your own company, so be it.  That's not a disorder.  These days, so many people are so "in your face" it seems like everyone is that way. Thinking about suicide does, however, require counseling.  You shouldn't be so unsocial that you'd rather be dead.  You should enjoy being alive.......even if it's alive and alone. <br>  <br>  Be who you are, as long as you really are happy that way.

juG7X5gyaa	It's a method we use to protect ourselves. Keep your pride to yourself - you can feel it, but don't show it right away.  No one suffers rejection easily.  It's a question of how we choose to react to it. And that choice is yours to make.  Also realize that life is full of surprises and the best may just be around the corner.  Most times, if something is done, just be glad you didn't get further involved in it - and move on.|`|YQNEB7CRaa	Well, I think that you shld express your real emotions. Well, you might not want to lose pride but letting out your real emotions and letting your bf know is a key to a good relationship. Hope this helps you!|`|djUMvICoaa	Sometimes it's not your pride that is in your way, it's previous relationships that cloud your way of thinking.  By that I mean you might not have been fully over the last guy, there were issues that were never resolved in your mind about him but you got involved with another guy and those issues ended up being a part of what was wrong with  this relationship, you were in it to replace the last guy rarher than to love this one.  They liken it to a funeral because you did lose something very special to you and you have to go through the process of becoming at peace with how it alll ended and sometimes that's hard.  But until you do that part you take those issues into your next relationship and it might be the dooming factor for you but it also means you weren't into the relationship either, you were looking for that bed partner and overlooked what wasn't right with him.

sfn6SpbCaa	I don't believe women have ever been oppressed. Since working as a homemaker is not oppressive to all, but to some, that shouldn't warrant it 100% oppressive.<br>  Just because some men feel their being oppressed by the work they do, while others don't that doesn't make what they do 100% oppressive. <br>  Your corrupt governments are by far your biggest oppressors of humankind; being that they work hard to keep their people down in fear they're going to rise against them. In a corrupt government there's always that certain individual who is going to rise and inspire those around him. Corrupt governments fear this individual from ever surfacing; therefore, all people are kept down.<br>  There are portions of government from within non corrupt governments who have a very biased view, which enables quite a bit of oppression of one gender over another. And not to forget the ruling of the rich and powerful; while they rule there are many who end up going without so they can keep what they already have and so they can have even more. The States is good for that.|`|QQQ36jMOaa	Ah, again a misconstruing of historical fact.  Where, praytell, did women work as only a homemaker and chef in history?  Europe?  Nope, the women were out there working on the farms with their husbands and kids.  Serfs?  Ah, nope.  Women were serfs too.  Japan?  No, agricultural work was done by both genders.  China?  No, same as Japan.  America?  Oddly enough agricultural work was seen as "women's work," not men.  Later on colonial women continued to work on the farm with their men up until the industrial revolution.<br>  <br>  So no, the women didn't stay in the house and cook and clean while the men went out and worked.  The women worked as well--often in backbreaking labour.  I find it so amusing whenever someone claims that women have always been "homemaker chef, clothier" only.  Did they have to do these jobs IN ADDITION to working the field?  Sometimes, yes.<br>  <br>  Now, back to the question.  Yes all lower classes were oppressed.  But even in the lower classes women had less legal rights.  Look at Athens, for example.  Women weren't citizens and couldn't vote.  Even male slaves could eventually gain citizenship, but not women.  Rome?  Nope, women had fewer rights there too.  Not to mention often pawned off like a piece of property for political reasons (which has been a tradition is a great many societies--though not all).  <br>  <br>  As for the military--some people seem to think that EVERYONE joined the military.  Hardly.  For many societies where a professional army existed, said army was voluntary unless something dire happened (like after the Roman Emperor Julian lost most of his forces in Persia).  If there was a war, the men were in it because they had volunteered into the military.  This was the case for Rome and most of Greece.<br>  <br>  FEMININECRONE--How interesting how you're quick to change history.  50 women throwing bales?  Hardly.  Given the society, working in the fields WAS their PRIMARY job.  Look at the example of France during the Crusades, for example.  What made the Children's Crusade possible?  Women, like men, were working so hard that no one was left to watch the children--leaving children to run about willy nilly.  If women's primary job during that time had been housemaker, there never would've been enough freedom amongst children to start the Children's Crusade.<br>  <br>  And India?  Women worked (work) just as hard doing heavy labor.  Some cultures talk about women giving birth in the fields--then going back to work soon after!  Children were often brought to the fields and then grew up there--working at a young age.  Thus why agricultural families will have more children--more labor--and that goes for both genders.  <br>  <br>  And CELTISH--I apologize that I took a reference from a different question and projected it onto yours.  That was unfair of me and I didn't mean to put words in your mouth.  I agree that both genders had it very bad, my only argument is that even in these lower classes, women still tended to have less rights than the men they were married to.  Voting, for one, holding any kind of office (and yes, poor, low class men held office in Athens), being seen as more than property was rarely something women had (property in the sense that if a man was harmed, the offense was against the man harmed.  If a woman was harmed the offense was against her father or husband--as she was their property).|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	They used to be.<br>  Feminism has put paid to that.<br>  The tables are almost turned.<br>  In some cases, now, men are beginning to feel discriminated against.|`|vEj7xoBraa	no.|`|O6EqTO6vaa	No. If women are oppressed with that, something is wrong. It's been that way for millions of generations. =)|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Men oppressed women; women oppressed their maids; the ruling class oppressed the peasants; the Imperialists oppressed their Medieval neighbors; the Ruler oppressed his scientists. It's too convoluted.|`|ZjCurM7saa	Notice that Fereshte conveniently and slyly changed the word "primarily" in her response to "only". Surely women engaged in some manual behavior in years past. But their relative weakness made them more suited to lighter jobs such as keeping up the home. That is why they PRIMARILY focused on that type of work. If we're talking about broad social "oppressions", we need to look at the predominant state of those people who were supposedly "oppressed". What historical relevance is it if 50 women in South Carolina threw around bales of hay while 50,000 were homemakers?<br>  <br>  It's precisely this type of sophistry that feminism relies upon in order to guarantee that their historical revisionism is believed by enough people to justify their convoluted belief system.<br>  <br>  Fereshte: You can only support your point with very isolated examples (sophistry at its best, given that the initial statement was that women PRIMARILY focused on domestic duties). Throughout Western Civilization women have primarily been tasked with domestic duties. Sure there are isolated examples of working in fields and there are probably just as many isolated examples of men tending the home. But for your purposes, since we're discussing the so-called "oppression" of women throughout history, we have to look at the general situation. Besides, I think you're shooting yourself in the foot by pointing out another feminist myth...That women were denied any employment that did not focus on domestic servitude. If these isolated examples existed, then women were not, on the whole, forced into domestic servitude. They preferred it.

f401ea307e44f234284f4730f9d3f181aa	Having both a girl and a boy, I can say my rules are even amongst the two (that are still young), but that my boy gets punished more often. Why? Because I've found a long time before my own, that girls tend to behave more often, trying to please by listening! Boys just don't care. And so in our house, it follows the same genera rule, that I am constantly on my boy's case, while my girl just does her own thing without breaking rules as often!!|`|9VAnsWYUaa	I agree.<br>  <br>  Funny how Feminecron and the other Feminist said the same thing, but one is TD'ed and the other, TU'ed.|`|A71Uu05Uaa	There's still a common misconception that females are too fragile/naturally innocent to be punished as harsh as males.<br>  <br>  Only giving girls a slap on the wrist teaches them that it's ok to misbehave, even as adults, because they wont really get punished much at all.

Bigger mis-step = bigger punishment.|`|84gK4XlHaa	I'm not around my friends or acquaintances with children enough to get a good idea of how discipline varies in house when they're not in public.  Most people don't, so it's hard to make generalizations.  My parents didn't discriminate on who got their butts chewed.  Or spanked for that matter.  I'm sure it happens, but I've never seen it.|`|qLBsTaDlaa	For my family only this wasn't true, but other families I have seen this, maybe it is the social stigma that girls are princesses and boys are bad and need to be fixed.|`|LR48Rtv2aa	I think it all depends on the family the child is growing up in.|`|ilBhV9O0aa	Girls have always been the "delicate" and "fragile" versions of boys.  We need punishment the same as boys, but we have had a firmer grip put on us because we are more vulnerable to bad things in the dark (if you catch my drift).  We raise our daughters to watch out behind them, never travel alone, "ladies don't act like that", etc.  We are more cautious of our girls that when they do something wrong we continue this "old school" way of viewing girls, they are delicate.  We really don't see that our daughters are just as rotten as our sons and more so if you ask me.  Speaking from my own experience when raising my son, I expect him to defy my authority time and time again, I wouldn't expect that out of my daughter, even though I know she does.  I was also a young girl at one time and more often than not I would hear "you wouldn't do that, your too sweet."  Don't believe it!!!!  My theory on this topic is you should discipline based on the crime.|`|un0C52G8aa	The notion that girls are much weaker than boys and need to be disciplined in a less harsh manner is a total crock. I have two girls myself and they are not weaker. In fact, when they were little, they could throw temper tantrums that were at least as violent as any of those I've seen from boys. They were just as capable of inflicting physical pain on us when we tried to restrain them.<br>  <br>  Don't treat girls like they're fragile beings because they're not. Some will learn to use that to their advantage to avoid being punished. It's not fair and they learn that they can get their way through manipulation and deceit.|`|wSqOwWlVaa	I mainly agree.  The downside to the freedoms of 'boys will be boys' is how much more harshly boys tend to be treated in return.  They are considered tougher and less vulnerable, so when they are punished, it tends to be much harsher.  Of course, the idea that any child is somehow tough or deserving of aggressive physical punishment is completely crazy.  When I was at school, I was annoyed that one teacher would always get the girls to dust the shelves, and the boys to do the lifting and moving stuff, but I used to watch the same boys getting smacked on the back of the head for very minor things and I didn't envy that.  It's no wonder boys are more likely to use aggression if they've been receiving end all their lives, so it all just seems like one big vicious circle to me.

AA11307468	I would say that most people (in the US anyway) lie when breaking up with their partners, to spare them the truth.  I personally disagree with this.  Even if the truth hurts, it can be said gently to ease the blow.  And it is easier to get over someone who has told you the truth because you have respect for that honesty.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Of course in 99% of cases, the person is breaking up because they've lost interest, but are trying to soften the blow.<br>  <br>  The problem is that people think reasons apply here, when they really don't. The dumpee thinks that, if they know the reasons, they can argue the person out of the dumpage; the dumper feels bad, and wants to not cause the other pain -- which is impossible in this situation.<br>  <br>  There's no way to say "my feelings of romantic interest went bye-bye" without it hurting the other.|`|UPMRdb4maa	i don't even know how you could manage to make this question so complicated. i have a hard time understanding it.<br>  a 5 stars for that. but if you got dumped that means it is time to move on personally i don't want to have a girl friend because of this.<br>  a suggestion from a dude. forget about the girl. grab your Xbox and kill as many as enemy as you can to relieve your stress then move on in your life.|`|XIbct4fuaa	Ive never used that line but Ive had it used on me a few times.

8f0f3a882068beac26a7cb59df3b0864aa	I understand COMPLETELY!  I went from major to major.  I now have 135cr hr and no degree.  I WISH I HAD GONE TO A CAREER COUNSELOR AND A LIFE COACH.   Therefore, that is what I advise you to do.  Your school should have a career counselor.  Go talk to someone in the administration department.  They'll give you some tests to match your likes, dislikes and talents and give you some ideas of career choices you may actually ENJOY doing.  A life coach couldn't hurt either.  Good luck.|`|djUMvICoaa	Where I went to college they had a special class that you could take to find where your interests would be best suited in what fields which it listed 5.  I thought I tried to sway it to things I had an interest in and it came back with stuff I never dreamed of, one of them writing, go figure, and after I got my head wrapped around that I have to agree all it said was true I would have been happy in any of them.  Anyway, if your college has that course I would look into it, it is well worth the time and it can help you find the right one, not just random thoughts.  If your school doesn't have it maybe they could point you to where you could find the course itself.  If you are going to put $50,000 a year into something it might as well be for something you will find your niche in.

So I never felt abuse.  Just the opposite: My wife is wearing the pants. And we both are very happy with it.

But seeing as she'd be loud, stinky, and poorly groomed...  can't see why you'd want to live with one.<br>  <br>  Most non radical fems would probably think they have more control than they really do.  She'd believe she deserves to win half of the arguments or make half of the decisions (at least) out of fairness or "equality"...   but the reality of it is that you need the ability and logical reasoning power to win said arguments and make said decisions.

juG7X5gyaa	Greed is a way of protecting ourselves and what we have.  That's why there's locks on doors.<br>  No, I don't think I'd remove it, unless it's out of control (such as that Madoff character who swindled billions of dollars from people). I believe wars come from believing we know what's best for others.  In some cases, war does start because of greed (Hilter).  It also is caused because of misunderstandings of each other on this planet. Evil is here because everything has two sides: hot/cold....good/evil.|`|OdoLSDlXaa	A little greed is a good thing.  It helps us to save, conserve, survive a great depression.  But when it goes too far, it results in much suffering of other people.  I can't give any of my food to that starving guy because I might need that food myself later.  There are other justifications as well, of course.  But I think the problem with greed is selfishness and hoarding.  <br>  <br>  We need a little selfishness for self preservation and hoarding is saving in overdrive.  The classic definition of virtue being a moderate amount and vice being extremes is how I see it.|`|uNc6C27Yaa	Somewhat probally the reason for some things but i don't think it will cause was or anytinh buy yes i would remove it but am not like that|`|PG2i5Ee6aa	1.

5Snex2peaa	Suppose the average car lasts 10 years.  Suppose the auto makers all know how to make cars last 20 years.  Suppose making that 20-year car causes 10% more environmental damage than making the 10-year car.  That is 45% less damage than 2 10-year cars.<br>  <br>  Computers can be designed so the CPU and memory is on one board and could be upgraded without buying a whole new computer.

Because sometimes your emotions can get in the way of you doing something you should be doing. I know that myself as I am sure we all deal with emotions at one time or another and I d ofind it hard to sometimes deal with it when for example if you miss someone or something like that or whatever the case maybe and the best thing to do is deal with it the best way you know how or even get some help if need be.

Of course, no one who had any brain at all would have believed such an absurd and disgusting lie.<br>  <br>  Whoever told you all such children are swept under the rug was also lying to you.<br>  <br>  Why do you only believe lies?|`|3862H0WVaa	No doubt.<br>  Feminism in the main being part of the marxist movement has for many years sought to undermine the fabric of our society with the justification of it being 'progress'.<br>  <br>  This is in my humble opinion a disaster in the making. When did it become uncommon for someone to say that marriage is the bedrock of our society. Why do these people try everything in their power to discredit an institution that has made civilization possible? What civilization never had marriage?<br>  No the marxist liberals have worked to discredit and undermine marriage through working on the younger generations and chipping away at it's relevance for 'their' idea of progress, my idea of degeneration. I don't understand their 'end game' but I believe when we eventually get there it will be more like hell than heaven even for the marxist die hards. Be careful what you wish for it may come true.<br>  <br>  This is only my opinion.<br>  <br>  @ fereshte...Have you been reading wikipedia again?|`|84gK4XlHaa	Gee, I don't know.  Is it considered an achievement to the men who helped conceive them?  You have this bad habit of assuming that all sexual precautions should fall on the woman.  Are men somehow incompetent when it comes to birth control or self-restraint?  You more than most should be aware of how to operate a condom.|`|eYdTRXFMaa	I don't know what the feminists think, but I believe that it is very important for the father to be present in the daily life of children.  This joint custody, "sharing the kids at different times" makes me sick.  No woman can be a father and a mother to a child.<br>  I realize that some circumstances call for the separation of the parents, but I am talking of the ones who choose to have a "no father" child.  IMO every child has the right to a good dad.  Nothing can replace a loving father, nothing.|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	Just because a mother is not married does not mean the father isn't around. Statistics taken in 2002 showed that about 20 percent of all new mothers under 20 were unmarried but living with the father at the time of the birth. That same was true of about 13 percent of all new mothers ages 20 to 24.  Does that mean I agree with this trend?  No.  But the statistic you quoted does not tell the complete story.<br>  <br>  That "50 percent of marriages in end divorce" statistic is misleading because the people who are divorcing in any given year are not the same as those who are marrying, and the statistic is virtually useless in understanding divorce rates. In fact, studies find that the divorce rate in the United States has never reached one in every two marriages, and new research suggests that, with rates being in decline since the early 90s, it probably never will.<br>  <br>  Edit: What pair of doofuses gave me thumbs down for quoting statistics?|`|veufnjsNaa	thats not caused by feminism at all.<br>  even though woman had children in wedlock back in the 1700s they lived unhappy lives where they were beaten and verbally abused in the name of god. <br>  they had no choice and were kept ignorant just to have a baby and be married? does that sound like a logical fulfilling life?<br>  and even having children in wedlock at that time meant nothing because even the men would cheat on their wives.<br>  at least now women are taking the initiative to not be with men like this and have the oppurtunity to put their children forth without abuse in the home and without conflict.<br>  the 1700s was a time where you would literally be banished if you had a kid out of wedlick even if you were raped.<br>  and something like rape was even blamed on the victim?<br>  hmmm...sound like the girls in these days have better chances to justice whether born in or out of wedlock.<br>  its no about feminism its about choosing whats best for the child.|`|AA11104093	I would like to propose a simple solution. Require a baby license from the government, church or "people like you and me" before anyone can get a baby license. <br>  <br>  This would end abortion and end unwanted pregnancies. If we charged a small fee we could balance the budget and end world hunger.<br>  <br>  Problem solved!|`|a9i8Q98Aaa	While I don't see anything wrong with having children out of wedlock, I really don't see it as anything to be proud of, or ashamed of.  Seriously, it's like being proud you blew your nose with a tissue instead of a handkerchief.|`|QQQ36jMOaa	Wow, that's about the same percentage of children conceived before marriage in colonial America.  Of course its a bit higher on the colonial side (numbers range from 40-60% depending on the state) but it seems things are keeping pretty consistent.  How interesting.|`|SvTVe4z4aa	since when is 'wedlock' anything to be proud of?|`|ygGr1nX7aa	What on earth does this have to do with feminism?|`|PXR90W9Laa	You don't need to be married to have a successful family.

Is it because you have no brain, no humanity, or both?|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	A lttile of both I think.  Plus, a lot of feminists were born in the 1950's and '60's when it was still considered safe to drink and take drugs while you were pregnant.|`|RHOiO24Gaa	Feminists are the product of wonderful mothering and high educations. I don't know where you come from but you are sorly out of tough with the new world.|`|GKgPTyM6aa	Pardon me?<br>  feminists simply want the right to live their lives as freely as a man and want to make their own decisions and to actually make the same amount as money as a man when they do the same job as a man. <br>  if you as me, feminists are the product of wonderful upbringing!<br>  if they are stong enough to stand by their beliefs in this male dominated world that does its best to make women feel horrible about themselves, then they are much, much stronger and usually better people than the men who have this idea that its ok to opress them. <br>  Please stop spamming up this section with your sexist comments|`|a9i8Q98Aaa	Neither.  Some people just are the way they are based on experiences not exclusive to parenting or education.  I know a chick who is a die hard feminist who is a freaking genius school wise and has very loving, supportive parents.  Part of me  believes that in her case it's just the 'girls are better than boys' phase coming about 10 years too late, but that's just my opinion of her.|`|O6EqTO6vaa	You're brutal. lol

I am truly sorry to hear this - I have always found you honourable, thoughtful, reflective, and if you haven't lived up to your very high standards, it might be that you are expecting something super-human from yourself.  Please have compassion for yourself.  <br>  <br>  As for the ways to keep from crying - it depends on the context.  I have sometimes found myself with psychotherapy clients being close to tears and while on occasion this is appropriate and OK, there are other times when I know it's my stuff and the client doesn't need that.  Usually, focussing very hard on the client and their inner world will help.  Other things that can help are digging my finger nails (if they're long enough at the time!) into my hands, or pinching the skin on the back of my hand or that old favourite of biting the lip - in other words, creating some non-dangerous pain that can absorb your attention.  Determinedly thinking about something else entirely can work.  If it's a situation where this is possible, I'd go off for a VERY brisk walk.<br>  <br>  I'm thinking of you and hoping that things get easier.

T4JEgbocaa	I believe that the Pope is supposed to have balls, so he can't have been castrated at the time that he becomes Pope. I don't know what the procedure is if the Pope loses his balls *after* becoming Pope.<br>  <br>  There are also limits (in the UK) on the damage that gay men with masochist tendencies can have done to them, but this kind of damage doesn't really count as a 'medical procedure'.<br>  <br>  So I suppose the answer to your question is 'no, not really'. The reason why special rules are applied to women, is because they are capable of carrying and nurturing inside themselves, something that at some stage becomes someONE.<br>  <br>  I have to admit that the Catholic / Christian Fundamentalist belief that an ovum becomes a human being, as important as a new-born baby, the moment it gets fertilised by a sperm, is pretty far-fetched. After all, a woman's body often expels fertilised eggs for a couple of weeks after fertilisation, if a malformation is detected. And nobody worries much about that. No mass is held over the toilet!<br>  <br>  But as the foetus develops into a new-born baby, I think that a line has to be drawn somewhere. I personally wouldn't draw that line at the moment of birth.|`|BkleL3F4aa	Infanticide is still illegal for men.

As much as it may be 'your body' - the baby inside you is 50% the fathers and you should have been well aware of what would happen to your body when you had sex - as such you were consenting to those changes in the event of pregnancy (ethically) in the same way as a man (legally) consents to be financially responsible for the outcome if you get pregnant. <br>  I have always said that where both parties don't want the baby it should be terminated, there are enough unloved children in the world! But where one parent wants that child and the other does not (be that man or woman) they should be made to live up to the consequences of their sexual actions - for a woman this means going to term and handing the child over to the father.<br>  You can be thankful in that I doubt it will ever happen in practice but ethically the argument is sound.<br>  In terms of your question, I think this has more of a religous founding than a gender based one.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	The reason we get more say is because while the fetus is 50% us and 50% the mans--it needs our body (which is 100% ours) to grow into a baby.  Thus why we get the final say.  I'm not sure why men think it would be moral for them to have control over what we do with our own body.<br>  <br>  Since it is currently our body and our choice, men should probably actually talk to the women they have sex with regarding issues such as this BEFORE they have sex.  That way the women could decide if having sex with the guy was worth being harrased to suffer through a pregnancy later or not.  Personally if someone told me they were pro-life before sex I'd tell him to take a hike.<br>  <br>  <br>  "Infanticide is still illegal for men. We wont have equality till men can carrry out abortions too."<br>  <br>  I guess that means we won't have equality until men can carry a pregnancy to term.  Good luck getting pregnant, dude.  Lol.|`|NYU37jfGaa	The thing about abortions is that they are not just related to your own body, but to somebody else's as well.  Namely the baby's.<br>  <br>  An abortion is not just a 'medical procedure' it is the destruction of a life.
vHxauOyeaa	Well you probably have an issue with anger by avoiding fights. This is somewhat of an inward explosive trend.

Maybe the person that got in through the window was someone you opened up to but he/she betrayed you (remember you might not be conscious of this secret, but it sometimes surfaces without you comprehending exactly what it is). In the last dream, maybe because you where not the driver of the vechile means that you are not in control of the situation, probably because you are not aware of it.<br>  meditate on the idea of this dream and you might find something profound about yourself.<br>  Good luck.|`|bGyVJ6meaa	You have views or experienced something in your life you want to keep hidden, and you are worried about people finding out.|`|H4zdyu2laa	They are zombies trying to get you in the castle so they drink your blood.|`|Y1bed2FJaa	it means you need 2 find mr or mrs right cuz u loanly|`|P505XBG0aa	i'M NO DREAM INTERPRETER, BUT IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE (oh srry..... didnt know i had this on cap lock...)  you have a secret, that maybe, is eating away at you, and you don't want others to find it out?

The incredible amount of money that is available is an indicator of the demand society has for this.

It's pretty commonly held that the majority of them are survivors of child sexual abuse who have some pretty severe emotional disfunction and really warped attitudes about sex as a result.<br>  <br>  That said, our society (especially with the increased acceptance of porn) sort of exudes those same abusive attitudes toward women and sex that I think damages, devalues, victimizes, and makes vulnerable increasing numbers of women to that same formula (witness all the racy Facebook profiles and trends in "sexting" or "girls kissing".)|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	Sorry to hear about your inability to get laid.|`|3862H0WVaa	I think that is very astute of you and Sigmund Freud would have agreed with your analysis as he worked out that prostitutes in his time were allowed to have sexual pleasure that was denied to 'normal' women.<br>  <br>  However as much I love Freud I do think he make 'everything' to sexual and he would admit to this failing in himself.<br>  <br>  I don't agree porn has tapped into a formula intentionally to attract women to be consumers.

Women are constantly and permanently in a state of competition with each other - it's an unwritten rule - which links nicely to the answer above mine which is 100% true. A woman would absoultely LOVE to be the one person who manages to change a guy, simply because either she has seen so many women before her fail, or to boost her own ego.|`|AA11166769	Well, on a conscious level, they actually believe that they do want a good man. However, on an unconscious level, they are drawn to a certain type, and often these types of men are the ones who are bad for them.
4lDeu3k9aa	You are not happy with certain aspects and circumstances in your life? You want a better job, more money, meeting your soul-mate… and possibly a thousand other things? <br>  <br>  Now, you have two possibilities: Either you go on with your life as usual and hope that things will change miraculously over time and that somehow all your dreams will come true one day. Or, you decide to stretch yourself a little bit and to actively make your dreams come true. <br>  <br>  Realize one thing: You are a born creator! The ability and power to create a life that's filled with love, abundance, happiness, peace and health is already within you. You just have to start making use of this incredible power.<br>  <br>  What exactly do you want? Write down what you would like to get or achieve - a few short sentences should be enough. Focus only on one goal at the beginning. <br>  Get absolutely clear about what you want and create a mental picture (or even an entire mental movie) of it. <br>  Add your emotions and feelings to your mental pictures. Make it feel as real and intense as possible - feel as if it would already be your reality. <br>  Stay focused on what you want and don't allow your "negative" mind to interfere. Your mind might tell you: "No, that’s not possible… , I can’t do that…". Don't give in to this kind of small-mind chatter. Dismiss your negative thoughts whenever they bubble up and re-focus on "I can" and "It's possible". If you believe that you can and also act like it, your mind will find ways to make your dreams come true! <br>  <br>  Allow this "magic" power that lies within you to take over and watch your dreams become reality. Suddenly, the pieces will start falling together: You meet the right people at the right moment, someone gives you that crucial and all-important tip that changes your entire life, the most amazing idea pops into your head - seemingly out of nowhere… Do your part of the work and the rest will happen on its own. <br>  <br>  Make this "attitude" of focusing on what you want (instead of focusing on what you don't want), visualizing- and feeling as if it would already be your reality a daily habit - in fact, make it your second nature. <br>  That's it - and it's really that simple. Believe me, developing- and making use of your creative powers is really fun and it’s tremendously exciting - much more than just sitting around and waiting for things to improve on their own. <br>  <br>   You can do it! Just take one little baby step after the other, believe in yourself.|`|7fd87a77e7b1eab8e246db5eaa04f9abaa	every day i try to cope with what happened to me in my past. it is very difficult because sometimes the past is so traumatic that it really affects the way a person acts, thinks and functions in their future, which is my dilemma. trying to fix what happened to me as a result of the past is a never ending task, and the worst thing is that the people who don't deserve it are the ones who suffer at the hands of what others do to them. don't blame yourself because it is just not fair, and that is life. it will be better some day you will see.|`|juG7X5gyaa	Yes!  I married a man I didn't love because it was "time" to be married. We had two children. One has Cerebal Palsy and is extremely smart. But can't do anything for himself.  He comes over to my house a few days a week while his Dad works...I have had so many surgeries from lifting him (he's 6' tall) and need two more.  I love him with all my heart, but in addition to taking care of him, my ex comes for dinner after work.  Now my 67 yr. old brother moved in with me (in a small duplex) because he went broke and left Denver - no money - nowhere to live. I had no choice but to take him in.  If you are younger than 55, I'd pack my bags, if I were you, and move somewhere else!  I wish I could move by my sister in Az., but where would that leave my son?  Alone with a father who mildly meets his needs.|`|FknQXMzRaa	Everyone does.

I was sooooooo stupid.  I thought because he went to church and sat in a pew, he was a Christian.  I am sooooooo stupid.  I don't know what I could have done, other than stay single, that would have made my life any different.|`|xgrNAwa1aa	I think a lot of people ask that same question. I know I have more than once in life. <br>  There is no way to change the past or what has already happened but you can change your future. It will take more discipline to do this because it's too easy to stay in our "trapped lives" than it is to move on and realize the only person we can change is ourselves.<br>  I try to not regret anything from my past because if it was a mistake and I actually learned from it, I believe everything including the choices we make good or bad happens for a reason. <br>  I had a great career and have had nothing but terrible relationships with other men. My career was my life and that ended in one split second in an on the job auto accident that left me disabled for life at age 31. It's now 10 years later and since I can't even get out to do the smallest things I used to, I have had way too much time to think; "What happened to me and my life?"<br>  If I could start over again, I would become a psychologist. Since being disabled, I have helped others that go through the same disease I have that causes never ending chronic pain. I also go to the psychology section on here and answer people's questions and it honestly helps me to feel better about myself to help another.<br>  Since none of us can just start over again, we do need to evaluate our lives no matter what age we are many times and make decisions according to our best interests. <br>  You can't change what you have been through but you can change the future or what you will or will not accept in your life any longer.<br>  Change within is possible

YOU ARE SPECIAL, YOU ARE NEVER ALONE IN SPIRIT, you are above those who treat you as an outcast. you are way out of their league, hold your head high and continue to be true to yourself and who you are because if you conform to act like them, then they will like you but will you like yourself?|`|64515c9dd3f1d42fce2093056b18e17aaa	being alone is only bad when you don't have voices that answer back.<br>  <br>  personally, i find peace in solitude. <br>  <br>  that, and yahoo answers. lol|`|2I5XqMDzaa	me 2|`|7fXpLlhBaa	Honestly, I think that people are overrated and being lonely is far too underrated. Do you want to know the truth? I believe that being best friends with yourself, doing things for yourself, being alone sometimes, is an extremely healthy thing. Having people that are close to you is also healthy, but it absolutely has its downs. When it comes down to it, there are only a select few people in this world that you will be able to 100% depend on. People suck, and I have learned that you don't need others to be completely happy. Sure, go out and make some friends, be as sociable as you can be- but my own experience? I have always been the social butterfly, people flock to me, I have tons of friends. And guess what? I am NOT the happiest person in the world. In fact, I'm often depressed. <br>  <br>  So, this proves to me that people really don't make or break anything. In fact a lot of the time people let you down and really people suck in general. Who needs em' eh?|`|juG7X5gyaa	Depending on your age, you aren't alone. I am 67 and never have been truly comfortable with anyone but my family. I'm a strong woman who prefers to be alone (twice divorced - 2 children).<br>  Always wished I could be one of those people who love everyone and everyone loves them. The best you can do is try to remeber that we are all here, just fighting our own battles to get through life. Try relaxing a bit about it..remember to smile and show interest in others.  Even if you have to fake it - it does work.  We have to work to "get out of ourselves" and think of others sometimes.
AA11868913	Dimethyltryptamine (a chemical released in your brain, a VERY potent hallucinative chemical) causes dreaming. It's actually a known hallucinogen. Dreams are actually DMT trips, bad dreams = bad trips, good dreams = good trips.<br>  DMT is what causes dreaming as well as the flashbacks of near-death experiences, and may very well be responsible for 'alien abductions.'<br>  <br>  Add on:<br>  DMT is a human neurotransmitter. It IS responsible for dreaming, everyone else is giving 2 cent remarks that are only 1/20% right. Google DMT or Dimethyltryptamine and read about it, not synthesized for the drug purpose, but N,N-Dimethyltryptamine produced by your pineal gland.|`|URZeQfQCaa	we dream every night regardless of if you remember them. it's a way of dealing with lifes emotions, stress and memories. some say you can induce dreams by eating cheese and onion before bed, or dairy products generally. i once tried smoking artemisia vulgaris which caused me to have very lucid dreams. very cool stuff.|`|Y1bed2FJaa	its called rem when u go into a state of sleep, a dream is basically a bunch of theories such as if u had a bad dream it could be training 4 any event that your scared 4 and your preparing 4 the worst so it doesnt hit u so hard or your brain is just cleaning out old info, dreams last btween 7 seconds and 21 mins|`|64515c9dd3f1d42fce2093056b18e17aaa	lmao. someone said freud.  if he could explain flying through the air or magic powers, i might not laugh at that. besides, he's thoroughly discredited. crackpot with a practice.<br>  <br>  dreams are a product of REM and memories being shuffled from short term to long term. it's an electrical impulse. just don't notice the man behind the curtain. lol.<br>  <br>  happy dreams!|`|ML3PGUPYaa	According to Freudian psychology, its all of the subconscious (or non wanted fantasies) that sit in your mind and are released at night time.|`|HwjYCfLJaa	Rapid Eye Movement causes dreams.

oQcrq39Eaa	For a rebel to conform is to diminish the value of the individual.  Its an assault on the the uniqueness and the expression of all the factors that make one unique.

9413ac0f3e1404255fa9d000ec0fd897aa	Hello.<br>  <br>  Okay I would say that this dream is trying to tell you that you are struggling to express your feelings. You prehaps have some issues which you feel you need to keep to yourself, but really you should be expressing them. The fact that you mention you remember the colour gold (golden) is an indication of your spiritual self and an enhancement of your surroundings. The Organ in dreams represents your talents and ability to communicate with others. Do you play a musical instrument in your waking life? If so then the dream maybe playing out as a rehearsal to improve your techniques. If you see figures in your dream that look like cartoons or are cartoon-like this usually means you are trying to escape from the stressful realities of your waking life. It can also mean that you need to be less hard on yourself and learn to laugh at yourself and at your own mistakes. Lastly relating to the other person getting things done very fast and you trying to slow things down tells me that in your waking life you are living life in the fast lane. You need to slow yourself down a little. <br>  <br>  Hope this has helped?|`|gCdP3NJGaa	2 things spring to mind<br>  1, this is all about different parts of yourself- are you rushing ahead with something while another part of yourself is cautioning yourself to slow down so you don't disrupt or sabotage your plans<br>  2, could this be about work- someone causing problems by rushing around being 'helpful' and you have to go along and undo the problem they created- which wouldn't be a problem if only they stopped for a minute and thought<br>  My feeling is that this is about yourself, maybe you need to stop and think very carefully about what you are doing and prioritise things. What you want to rush ahead and do first may not be what needs doing first!<br>  Hope that was some help!
3EOWx0Xoaa	You have a long way to go in life, and there will be so many twists and turns.  Anything is possible.  The economy is tough right now, but switching careers might not be a bad thing or impossible.  Everyone has room in their budget.  I switched careers about 7 years ago.  It's a tougher job but I'm making more money now.  The good thing is, I know I can find a job in my previous career if needed.<br>  <br>  I would say you should find what you want and work with your husband to get it done.  Otherwise you will probably crack and abandon your life all together in one form or another.  If you're completely miserable and dwelling on "what if?" I don't think that would be any good for you, your husband, or your son.<br>  <br>  You have to take care of yourself first, your marriage second, and your children third.  If you fall apart, your marriage and parenting will follow.  If your marriage falls apart, your son will not get the parenting he would get otherwise.  Find what you want or need to be fulfilled and work with your husband to get it.<br>  <br>  If you just had your child, do you think you could be suffering from postpartum depression?  You might want to see someone about that, from what I understand it can be extremely difficult to handle without help.<br>  <br>  Also, going to church could help too.  I know you've shot this option down already, but if you really want to change, you have to do something different than you're doing now.  If you are in a spot in life that you don't like, you must be open to all options others suggest, or it's pointless to ask for help.  Many churches provide opportunities for volunteering and helping others, which can provide a way for you to feel like you're making a difference in the world.  Also, churches can provide excellent networking opportunities for those looking to change careers or find activities to enjoy and the people to enjoy them with and friends, support groups, etc... I know you've shot this option down already, but if you really want to change, you have to do something different than you're doing now.  Remember that the definition of insanity is doing the exact same thing the exact same way and expecting different results.<br>  <br>  I hope I have helped you even a little.  Good luck.|`|3d97e0903de2c4ce8a8b79492024ff4aaa	I have been through 12 and I am only 18.|`|DsEEATKSaa	God-shaped holes in one's life are only fillable one way.<br>  <br>  Perhaps it is the spiritual component in the life of your family which is leading to this uncomfortable feeling of incompleteness (i.e., "is this all there is").<br>  <br>  Consider attending your local Christian church this weekend. You may be pleasantly surprised at what you discover.<br>  <br>  ~Dr. B.~|`|xgrNAwa1aa	I don't see this as a mid life crisis as much as I see two younger people that are stuck in the economy crisis as just to keep the job you have is a gift. <br>  There is more to life and you could look at others who do not have it as well as you and your family does. You should be able to think to yourself; at least my life isn't that bad. <br>  If you want more out of life but say you have no time, other than work think about what takes up most of your time outside of any career. <br>  I believe if you tried to find a church where you felt at home, you might find answers to life's questions like this. <br>  It took being in an auto accident 10 years ago and finally finding a church about 2 years ago that has helped me be okay with all that has happened to me in my own life. <br>  I do not have a significant other, I lost the best career that I loved, and any hopes, dreams, and goals I had 10 years ago were taken from me in an instant. <br>  Looking back at what I thought was the "daily drag" of life now looks like a great dream to me after not being able to walk at all for over 2 years and only in the past 2 years being able to go out at all for fun or to church. I'm alone in life yet I am filled through Christ. <br>  If I am able to get out two days a week just for a few hours, I am now thrilled and have had to accept my life in chronic pain 24/7. Had I not found God in my life again, I don't even know if I would be here as mentally this disability took so much from me and I'm not the same person I once was; strong and independent.<br>  I have actually found I have become a better person from all I've been through. You really need to think that the simple things in life are truly the best and we take for granted our health too much. I did before this accident as being only 31 at the time, who would have thought I would be where I am now? Surely not me.<br>  After reading your details you added, I'm not trying to "push God on you" but only telling you my personal story and hope you get something from it.

8Q6mLWHsaa	It is funny because one of the concepts of feminism is suppose to be a confident, secure, and independent woman. Now let me think here for a minute. If a woman gets OFFENDED because an EVIL MAN "violates" her "INDEPENDENCE" by helping her. Because she thinks he is suggesting that "she can't handle it" that tells me she is not secure.  Men have more than likely been taught by their parents to treat the opposite sex with respect in America. I am sure you can go to other nations, and not find this. In some nations women are REALLY treated as second, or third class citizens, or even like cattle.<br>  <br>  Historically in America even at our worse men have been taught to treat women with aa certain level of respect, and care. I get the impression some feminists do not want any cohesiveness between the sexes at all. If the radical feminists keep on pushing the issue when there is nothing to push they mind find themselves in a hard backlash.<br>  <br>  Miss J is right some men have manners, and women who get offended, annoyed,irate or what ever at a man helping them need to take a step back, and rethink their backwards "thinking". They need to except kindness when it is displayed, and not view everything through a "dimmed pair of glasses"|`|b4wwddhbaa	Some overly-sensitive women might be offended by these actions, but generally women appreciate it when a man opens a door, offers a seat, or tries to help in some way.  The opposite is also true - some overly-sensitive women may be offended if a man doesn't do these things.<br>  <br>  Of course, sometimes a guy just gives off a creepy vibe, and a woman may act rude not because she's offended but because she doesn't want a creepy guy paying attention to her.  You can't really generalize, and you can never know how a woman you don't know will react to politeness.  I think it also depends on where you live.  Here in Texas, I think it's pretty much expected (although some young men are no longer getting that message).|`|1suTgWGoaa	Look at  feminist’s  way of discussion for answering a simple question.: <br>  Question: if a man opens a door for you, is it a offensive act for you?<br>  Feminists answers:<br>  “…..Sure there are some extreme feminists, but most of us just want equality.,,<br>  “…but we know the difference of a polite guy and a guy who's putting on an act to get what he wants…” <br>  “Feminists stand up for other women….,”<br>  “ We are angry when we find out someone was abused, raped, or disrespected…”<br>  “ We see other women as "our sisters…,”<br>  “ We believe in equal pay, <br>  equal rights,<br>  and respect for each other…”<br>  <br>  Did any body got it, that you should open the door or not!!<br>  <br>  I say the best thing is, when you see a feminist tell her to open the door for you, needed or not I like it..|`|F6K4mNBUaa	I think that's a bit over the top if they get all offended from that. Some men actually have some manners and respect for women, so why would they make a big deal about a kind person?|`|GKgPTyM6aa	I wouldnt say it was offensive as long as the man in question would accept the same gesture from a lady and doesnt do it because hes under the impression that she cant do it on her own|`|AA12330668	If they do, they are silly.  <br>  I have no problem at all with a man treating me like a lady.  This does not lessen me as a woman, or a person.  it is just common decency.|`|62c6bff7f35c50e4b269e4f30ac1040caa	Do you think we are too weak to carry our own bag ? or too stupid to operate something as complex as a door ?<br>  Which is it, you sonofabitch !|`|U08DXs8Gaa	A man does those things, not because she is a lady, but because he is a gentleman.|`|AXNowGPyaa	Men are supposed to carry the stuff for the women.|`|A71Uu05Uaa	They are under the delusion that they, themselves, are manly.  And any assistance from a man, would hurt that delusion.<br>  <br>  Just as twisted as guys who want to women.<br>  <br>  Generally, it's rude to refuse assistance that someone has offered.  But there are people who don't care if they are rude to others.<br>  <br>  The other side of it is that women try to read into things way too much.  A simple gesture of manners and kindness is somehow turned into a message of them being weak.  <br>  <br>  A similar tactic is used to turn just about any statement into a man calling her fat, as well.|`|wkjncmHTaa	If I'm genuinely struggling of course it's nice to receive assistance. I offer it myself, to both men and women. If I'm not struggling there's no point in offering to help. Opening the door for people is just a nice thing to do sometimes, for both men and women. A man offering his seat to a woman just because she's a woman is silly - offering a seat to someone who looks like they need it is common courtesy.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Uh, first you ASK if feminists object, then you say we all DO object.<br>  <br>  No, most feminists I've ever known don't get bent out of shape by door-holding or help carrying.<br>  <br>  There's also the issue of OFFERING help, as opposed to forcing someone to accept "help" they don't want. Sometimes that's the issue.<br>  <br>  Or, if a guy breaks his neck tearing across the room to open a door I can open by myself -- that is, whether the help is within reason.<br>  <br>  Finally, there's also nothing wrong with a woman holding a door for a man yet many men completely freak out at this.<br>  <br>  One more 'finally' -- there's also different manners required by social, compared to business situations. In business, one is not supposed to notice sex, which is irrelevant. Thus, lower ranking people hold the door for their boss, whatever sex everyone is.<br>  <br>  If a woman's job includes carrying things, then it's insulting to assume she needs help.|`|1168bcccfff6f3a578ef3a0223e4cce5aa	I have had this happen. I've helped a new mother burdened with shopping bags to carry a pushchair up some stairs and opened the door for her only to get a sneer and get "I could've managed" from them. I've also lost count of the number of times I've held a door open for someone not to even be acknowledged, not just for women either, I'll add - manners should breed manners and if I do a good deed I least expect a smile or a thank you.<br>  <br>  Thankfully most people are pretty courteous and, although at the time you swear you'll never help people again, the majority of good folk do appreciate a simple gesture of help. I always thank people who help me, regardless of their sex, colour or whatever so I suppose it's only reasonable in your own head to expect the same in return but ultimately we must accept there are some ignorant women AND men out there.|`|RHOiO24Gaa	I don't think to many women would take offense to general politeness from the opposite sex. You have to remember there are jerks in every walk of life and that includes feminists,by the way who isn't a feminist anymore. I thought that was just standard with any women under 70.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i don't know<br>  its nice if someone holds a door, and i do it for othe people<br>  however i guess if they think somehow its implying that your too imcompetant to do it yourself it offends them<br>  which i don't think is the idea at all, its just a nice gesture|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	it would be very rude for ANYONE to get offended by this! <br>  i have seen men open doors for women and other men and women holding doors open for men and other women!!  there isn't a power kick here and no one is saying by holding the door open (you are weak) <br>  it's a kind action. Period.<br>  <br>  my question is if another feminist held a door open for another feminist would she react the same if it was a man... if she wouldn't then she isn't being equal is she!|`|L9Q6r42Qaa	Because in a feminist mind the man is telling them that they are to fragile, weak, or dainty to do things for themselves. Feminists want to make a statement that they are strong independent and are capable of taking care of themselves and not being treated like they are helpless.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	It's never offencive to offer help to a stranger. If I saw a man with his hands full or struggling with something I would help too. It's not to say that one is stronger than the other, sometime everyone just needs an extra set of hands.<br>  <br>  I have been offended on rare occasions by "chivalry" but it's not too often. I was parking one time and an old man took it upon himself to "wave me in" to the space as if I couldn't have done it by myself. I only find this offencive because I doubt he would bother doing that for a man.<br>  <br>  I like Robert K's answer. That says it all.|`|2KC467tFaa	I think you have the wrong idea of what "feminist" is. Sure there are some extreme feminists, but most of us just want equality. We respect kind guys, but we know the difference of a polite guy and a guy who's putting on an act to get what he wants. Feminists stand up for other women. We are angry when we find out someone was abused, raped, or disrespected. We see other women as "our sisters". We believe in equal pay, equal rights, and respect for each other. We don't think one gender is better than the other. We respect kind people. My husband opens doors for me, cooks, and does all kinds of things for me. It's not because I need him to do those things. It's because he respects me. I would never snap at him for doing something thoughtful. I'm sure other people have different definitions, but this is mine.|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	No, but I do get somewhat offended if a guy refuses similar help from me.|`|9ed226ee22a85f302293fed29122bfe1aa	Chivalry is dead<br>  <br>  And women killed it.|`|531f6a6374dfe1e1a0a3027ce2dd7ae5aa	No. Someone is messing with you.

8vgrB62Raa	It's not bad at all. I would suggest going to bdsmsingles.com. you can look me up too :P MistressVictoria. It's a perfectly healthy normal thing to want to submit, or want to be dominant. It is something we lack in every day life. It's powerful, either way. To give yourself over, or to have someone give themself to you. There is a kinship, a trust, a shared experience that impacts both parties. If you're not sure if you would want to do it, check out sites like men in pain, and other such resources. Or let whoever it is that will dominate you know how you feel. No one as a dominant wants to do anything that would push you too far. You can set the limits right for you.|`|AA12299134	It is only 'normal' in the sense that most people in the world get involved in such a thing, but that doesn't really happen.  However, it doesn't make it 'bad' (that is only a judgement brought up by people who fear what they don't know or understand) because it would be very boring if we were all the same.  What I would say is go for it, because it is something that you really want to do, and it would make you feel good.  You would probablybring pleasure to the other people too, so there is nothing bad about that.  Whatever your sexuality, it is right for you, so go ahead and fully explore it - for you it will be a very GOOD idea.|`|trMsK86jaa	Sorry, i'm not hiring for disciples or acolytes for my secret heretical society at the moment, please ask again at another date.|`|RLoilwCNaa	Do it or you'll think about it forever.

8f0f3a882068beac26a7cb59df3b0864aa	Death is a sad thing, even if it is a stranger.  It is the ultimate loss of humanity.  It's profound and your emotion shows that you value life.    Perhaps, get together with some friends tonight and do something.  Getting back into life is the best way to recover from a brush with the reality of mortality.|`|djUMvICoaa	You may be having a lot of empathy for the survivors, feeling their hurt, seeing their hurt, it all affected you.  There is nothing wrong with that it makes you connected to your feelings.|`|hpzfccwaaa	You were grieving in a different kind of way. We have different kinds of love,joy and sadness that we seldom recognize as apart from the whole spectrum of our experiences. They are different and i embrace them as true.|`|juG7X5gyaa	Funerals force us to realize our own mortality. It can be a downer!|`|91WyJ72uaa	It's how our brains function. We have feelings for the people we know and love.  Even if we knew who they were but never met them, you still see them almost everyday or not, but still, if you see a neighbor that has 2 small dogs, and the owner is an old lady, you'd probably think "Hmmm....that lady looks nice."  Then when you meet her, she's all nice and you still don't know much about her.  But when she dies, you have that feeling just bursting out of you, because you feel sad that she has passed away and now her dogs have no owner.  There, the dogs, you think about the dogs and then you think about the old lady and how she took care of them.  If you get what I'm trying to say,please understand that I'm trying my best to explain. If not, sorry.|`|wbnqzpoCaa	You are thinking about your own mortality.|`|xgrNAwa1aa	Funerals not only bring out our own mortality but also makes us think of family and friends we are very close to and what it would feel like to lose them.<br>  Even if you didn't know the person well, you had probably heard great things about them from people that were close. You saw their heartache over the loss and felt for them as a caring person.<br>  If you haven't ever been to any funerals or not many, it is hard to face death in that way. It shows us that we do not live on forever in this world and how one day you can be here and the next you can be gone. <br>  It sounds like you are just a very sensitive and caring person for others and respected their grief and took some of it on yourself.<br>  That's okay and normal.|`|7a8qCNU2aa	Formaldehyde is an eye irritant.
iWXQH1Jeaa	Because they want to try to push their personal views onto the women who want to have abortions. I support abortions (within reason) and I'm also a male. Abortion isn't murder. Only religious people say that.|`|zxZxsTREaa	Maybe a man has more sense in saying no to abortions, than what a woman does. I think it's wrong personally, there should be no option on getting an abortion.|`|CnSaGHqWaa	My point exactly for the last twenty years or so. Not only should men not be allowed a final vote on pro or anti abortion, they should be discriminated against for lobbying or protesting.<br>  <br>  I'd like to know by what design men could be anywhere near an understanding of how or what a female feels or thinks when they are pregnant. The purpose of a man is impregnating, like a farmer planting the seed. After that it is hundreds of times more effort for the female, to grow the seed, provide substance, and feel the effects of having something grow inside them. I don't know a man that could possibly understand this process outside of reading about it.<br>  <br>  I also believe it should not be a decision for our the US Federal government. What makes them more aware of what goes on in an individual state more than the states elected lawmakers. <br>  <br>  This is so screwed up, it's beyond belief.|`|xL6McXTfaa	I used to agree.  But then I realized, I've never been pregnant, I think that I have a right to be involved in the abortion debate.  The only difference between me and men is that I'll probably get pregnant someday, and men won't.  And then what about infertile women? they'll never get pregnant.  Should they be involved?|`|H9OPAm4Kaa	That's a ridiculous and sexist question. Half all fetuses are girls...|`|bqkfu6Diaa	I don't get it either. It's kind of like letting women decide if men should be castrated or not.|`|V4gFzd2laa	If a woman can't make the decision to Not have an unwanted pregnancy,why should her views on murdering a child matter. I mean lets be honest they teach about birth control in 7th grade.If you are pregnant don't make it a Man over woman issue. You didn't think then and If you murder your child you will suffer forever because Karma works. Its not just her life that changes,her child never has a choice.Thousands want kids that can't have em, and would gladly accept the blessing that you can so callously throw out!<br>         If a man killed his wife because a divorce is messt inconvenient or "hard on him" he would deservedly go to prison for life. Yet a woman can kill ,sanctioned by a liberal government, for her convenience.|`|bLvTPXJ8aa	That's like saying men shouldn't be allowed to make laws against rape because it doesn't affect them.

Anyway as for you question why do we go for girlier guys (and this is girls in general, not just ones from karachi, because i'm from Australia and i feel the same) anyway, it's because they're more sensitive, and usually respect us more.

Khwt4oL6aa	To see your grandmother in your dream, represents nurturance, protection, and unconditional love. Consider the qualities and characteristics that exist in your own grandmother.<br>  <br>  To see a dog in your dream, symbolizes intuition, loyalty, generosity, protection, and fidelity. The dream suggests that your strong values and good intentions will enable you to go forward in the world and bring you success. Alternatively, it indicates a skill that you have ignored or forgotten. If the dog is vicious and/or growling, then it signifies some inner conflict within yourself. It may indicate betrayal and untrustworthiness.<br>  <br>  If the dog is dead or dying, then it indicates a loss of a good friend. Alternatively, it represents a deterioration of your instincts. Also consider common notions associated with the word dog, such as loyalty ("man's best friend") and to be "treated like a dog".<br>  <br>  To see blood in your dream, represents life, love, and passion as well as disappointments. If you see the word "blood" written in your dream, then it may refer to some situation in your life that is permanent and cannot be changed. If something else is written in blood, then it represents the energy you have put into a project. You have invested so much effort into something that you are not willing to give it up.<br>  <br>  To dream that you are crying, signifies a release of negative emotions that is more likely caused by some waking situation rather than the events of the dream itself. Your dream is a way to regain some emotional balance and a way to safely let out your fears and frustrations. In our daily lives, we tend to ignore, deny, or repress our feelings. But in our dream state, our defense mechanisms are no longer on guard and thus allow for the release of such emotions.|`|y2Uks58paa	it means you love your dog and dont want anything bad to happen to it?? idk just a thought|`|apkNp6mNaa	Do you feel like your Grandmother has snatched something away from you emotionally?

YWdXu0NMaa	actually when ever we tired or we wanna do rest the first thing comes in mind is go home and stay there,or whenever we have some kind of problem we want to discuss with family and if there is someone who is from outside so we feel uneasy to share in front of others or if we want to rest then outsiders rutiene may disturb us and basically we dont like to share our personal life,things and relation with others as we dont want that our mom or dad give attention to anyone as except us|`|CKusjKJ7aa	well you could that way for a variety of reasons:<br>  <br>  1.  You get bored of them<br>  2.  You find their presence annoying after a while<br>  3.  Do they invade your space?  How's your privacy when someone is living with your family?<br>  4.  Has anyone done something that maybe provoked the strong dislike you have for that situation?<br>  <br>  Only you know for sure why you dislike/hate them.|`|vY5HUrQPaa	1. Invasion of privacy<br>  2. Interruption of intimate relationship with your parents<br>  3. You may feel forced to always be on your P's an Q's to get along.<br>  4. Selfishness <br>  5. You may dislike habits, attitudes, personality, etc. of relatives staying with you.<br>  <br>  Try to remember that time brings change. How you get through it depends on your attitude. Whatever you do or say will come back to you. It's inescapable.<br>  <br>  Years ago, my dad met a young lady after my mom died. At first, things went well, until she kept coming over to our home more frequently, sometimes unannounced. I became annoyed at first. Then because of her family problems, she ended up staying and traveling with us! This woman became more possessive, and took my precious time away from my dad. This resulted in bitterness and anger for me, especially when I saw that the situation wasn't improving. <br>  <br>  Eventually, this woman saw through what was happening and finally moved out a few years later. I still tried to avoid her when she dropped by for a visit. What brought real change in me was when I stopped trying to ask God to get rid of her, and to help me instead. Can't tell you when, but He did remove bitterness and anger about this person a short time later. I even ended up inviting the woman to a ladies event at my church and tried to encourage her when she had more family problems.<br>  <br>  Try looking for the best in people, and plan to do things together with your relatives to make living conditions more tolerable. You can't change them, but you can change your reaction and outlook. Begin the best relationship that changes you from inside forever, and affects those around you: Just ask Jesus Christ to come into your heart, to forgive you of any sin. Thank Him for dying for you so you can have eternal life. Confess that you believe He's the Son of God who has risen from the dead. Tell Him that you'll live for Him.<br>  <br>  Then stay in contact by talking to the Lord everyday, and follow His Life Manual (the Bible) daily, starting with St. John.. Make friends at a local Bible-teaching  church and tell others about Jesus.

I have been in your shoes, and it was not that long ago.  My advice is to hang in there.  If you think you are depressed and stressed in college, its only going to get worse in the "real world".  When I was in college, I could not wait to graduate and never turn back.  Well, I have only been out college since May and I am already enrolling in a Masters Program.  These days, college is one of the best places to be.  With the economy in the tanks, college is the best place to get prepared for when the economy comes back.  There are jobs, but these days people with Masters degrees are applying for jobs in coffee shops because they lost their job and need to make money no matter what.  My advice, stay where you are.  Hang in there, its only one teacher.  Everybody that goes through college has the one mean old teacher that gets a thrill out making things more difficult then they need to be.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mxtrFDvbaa	Well, stupid and lonely, if you just leave and go out in the real world you will be more stress because you couldnt find a job without a real diploma and then you would kill yourself.|`|UzpSlfJhaa	You'll be more stressed if you leave.  You'll find a job making less than you could with a degree, which might stress you out.  Just go with the flow.  It won't last forever.
2eWVaB9Waa	It has some truth in it. 'Nice' people generally have traits that others take advantage of.<br>  <br>  The word nice is also very loose and it's definition in relation to 'nice guys' differs from person to person.<br>  <br>  Some 'nice guys' try too hard to impress and satisfy the girl they like. They allow themselves to be walked all over, try to buy her affection with gifts and agree with what ever she says.<br>  <br>  Some 'nice guys' are just genuinely nice people who are very considerate. They may feel sympathy and naturally take into account the girls feelings. Not for the reasons of 'nice guy' number 1 I mentioned, but they just take others into account.<br>  <br>  I'm drawing away from your question somewhat for which I apologies, but I would like to mention what ever the reason for being 'nice', gentlemen who fall into this category only have themselves to blame, whether it be finishing last, being used, screwed over etc.<br>  <br>  No one forces any of these 'nice guys' to do the 'good' things they feel is necessary to keep or impress the girl. If they are taken for a ride, it's their own fault. Emotions are a strong thing, but deep down and when we open our eyes, many know they are being taken advantage of, they just don't want to admit it. It's only till after it's over, they realise how dumb they were.<br>  <br>  It should also be worth mentioning that some 'nice guys' are far from nice. Constantly giving, suffocating her and emotionally blackmailing her to 'love' you back because of all you have done is not so very 'nice'.|`|oFR4yvHaaa	I wouldn't say "nice guys" finish last. I'd say "doormats" finish last.<br>  <br>  Any man with a SPINE, will not finish last... nice or not. <br>  <br>  But being spineless doesn't make you "nice" anymore than being strong makes you mean.|`|ZjCurM7saa	It's false. Fools finish last. It's perfectly possible to be nice without allowing others to take advantage of you.<br>  <br>  Case in point: My wife's deadbeat friend wanted to borrow money from us because she couldn't afford her house payment. She was a subprime borrower with an 11% interest rate who happened to have a loan on a Lexus and a Honda Accord. I told her no because her financial situation went beyond borrowing more money. I told her to sell both her cars and buy something cheap if she wanted to fix her financial situation. She stopped talking to us.That's not being "mean". It's being prudent and wise while trying to steer someone into a better way of living. Somebody who lent her money wouldn't be "nice". He would be a "fool".<br>  <br>  Seeker of Painful Truths: A person's perception of you does not define you. After all, what if one person thinks you're nice and another thinks you're mean. Does that mean you're nicemean?|`|8ldA7Z3Baa	Nice guys finish very last in almost every way because it's a dog eat dog world and nice people in general are usually the victims, not the winners at that game.<br>  <br>  Nice guys are usually pushovers, shy, not confident or assertive enough, very passive, beta, used, the kind of guy who just lets things happen and accepts how things are for the sake of being "nice". After a few years of not getting very far in life, some of these guys grow some balls and start becoming smart risk takers, leaders, and decide to put an end to allowing people to use them and control their lives, and take charge of their own destiny. You can't go very far in life unless you do, which is why the nice guys, or nice people in general, finish last almost every single time.<br>  <br>  The goal should be to have a balance of being nice and cool, but a hardass when life puts you into a circumstance where you need to be that in order to survive.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Yes I changed what I said in this "Edit" section. I did so because of what Feminecronomicon said about perception, & what Mike -T said about the word "nice" not meaning "spineless". The word "nice" means slightly different things to different people which almost renders the word to be meaningless. The bottom line is, you will finish last if your too extreme in any direction whether your being nice or not.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Depends on which women the nice guys are pursuing. If they're going after the shallow ones they are likely to finish last. But if they are looking for a woman of substance, the kind who appreciates a man's character, they will do way better.<br>  <br>  In the business sense it doesn't have to be true. Nice doesn't mean that you are a doormat who never stands up for yourself, or that you are incompetent. I think you can be nice and still succeed.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Depends, but yeah lots of nice guys get screwed over because they're being "too nice", so I'd probably lean toward true with a but.<br>  <br>  How's that for indecisive? o_O|`|x5MYW2LPaa	Sexually yes ;) In other ways no. Nice people attract good things, friends love and kindness and a loving wife.|`|phJfL2wTaa	I take the "Finish Last" as referring to business and career, and it is  more true in this area than any other, making money is not "nice guy" friendly.<br>  <br>  But the historical meaning .......<br>  <br>  ": NICE GUYS FINISH LAST -- "Ruthless tactics succeed more than kindness. This statement is generally ascribed to baseball manager Leo Durocher, (1905-1991) whose fiery style earned him the nickname 'The Lip.'.He led three teams into the World Series - the 1941 Brooklyn Dodgers, who lost to the New York Yankees; the 1951 New York Giants, who lost to the Yankees; and the 1954 Giants, who swept the Cleveland Indians.(the idea) is an ancient one, 'More nice than wise' had made it into John Ray's proverb collection of 1670." From "Southpaws & Sunday Punches and other Sporting Expressions" by Christine Ammer (Penguin Books, New York, 1993).<br>  <br>  In Durocher's 1975 autobiography ("Nice Guys Finish Last", of course) he claims he was misquoted. The remark, or something similar, was made on July 6, 1946 when Durocher was managing the Brooklyn Dodgers. He made was referring to his crosstown rivals the New York Giants when (according to him) he said "Take a look at them. They're all nice guys, but they'll finish last. Nice guys. Finish last." He was quoted the next day by reporter Frank Graham of the New York Journal-American as "Nice guys finish last". Graham never took notes, and was reputed to have a photographic memory, which Durocher did not dispute. With Durocher and Graham in the dugout that day was Lou Effrat of the New York Times. Effrat quoted him as saying "Nice guys finish eighth".<br>  <br>  There's more controversy, too. In 1992 a man named Ralph Keyes wrote a book called "Nice Guys Finish Seventh" as a compilation of misquotes. But nobody says Durocher said that, either. The "seventh" version goes that Durocher was referring to the standings as of July 6 ("Why they're the nicest guys in the world! And where are they? In seventh place."). The Giants were in seventh place then, and they finished eighth that year (last place). But in the "seventh place" version Durocher is not offering a prediction, just an observation.<br>  <br>  Despite years of trying to clarify what he said, by the time his autobiography came out, he must have finally given in. How could the publisher call the book anything else? And the public was in agreement. Nice guys finish last. In chapter 1 ("I Come to Kill You") Durocher states that the quote is Bartlett's Familiar Quotations "right there on page 1068, between John Betjeman and W.H. Auden. Who the hell were Betjeman and Auden, anyway?" Well, who can name a quote by either of those guys?"|`|zHmZkMStaa	Absolutely false.  I've been a nice guy all of my life (53 yrs), and though I've taken some hits along the way, I'm way up high on the happiness and contentment scale when I compare myself to others who lack the 'nice' gene.  :)<br>  <br>  BTW; nice of you to ask!  LOL!|`|qLBsTaDlaa	Truly Nice Healthy people finish first (be able to take care of themselves and be assertive), fake nice unhealthy people finish last eventually.|`|9ncFHzftaa	True right now....but I'm hoping in the long run that changes.|`|CspMhUPoaa	True for the most part.|`|NUGErTlzaa	False, in my case anyways, because my guy is a nice guy who finished first in my book.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	Bunk.

I used to be a nice guy, but I developed an aggressive attitude during college and work. Without it I wouldn't have survived college or the work environment.<br>  <br>  Nice guys aren't very aggressive. So they are less likely to pursue things on their own and more likely to be bullied.|`|NnG5GBGAaa	Define "nice guy".<br>  <br>  The man who finishes first, is the one who can balance nice guy with dominant male.<br>  Strong enough to stand on his own two feet, sweep me off mine, but not let me use him as a door mat.<br>  Nice...as in...well mannered, well groomed, well educated.<br>  <br>  A gentleman on the streets and a freak in the sheets!
