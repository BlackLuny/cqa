Most any Victorian really. When mature, I find the males of the Fulu's have such a striking color I couldn't wait to acquire this species. Given how common in the hobby and trade typical Mbuna, even my Haps are, and that most cichlids from lake Victoria are endangered or extinct in their natural habitat, I have to go with this, because I actually have them.  A VERY close second here is Astatilapia Aenocolor, aka the Albert Yellow Bellies.  Smaller growing bi-colored and mild.  Ideal starter fish for medium sized tanks.<br>  <br>  If I were to pick a second type, I'd go with Paratrolopeus Menarambo. I've begun a collection going of both Madagascars, where these are from, as well as Victorians. The species in Madagascar I find very intriguing as the looks of these resemble very closely, South Americans, and they break from the norm of typical Africans in that most Madagascar species are egg layers.  I currently have 2 week old Pytchochromis Oligocanthus in my 100 gallon.  Second time I've had an substrate spawner spawn for me and it's very rewarding to watch the huge cloud of fry.  Very huge too, at least 2-300 fry in there with mom and dad.|`|jBh36NTzaa	My favorite would be a Jewel/Peacock Mix, I have one and they are sweet. <a href="http://www.aquariumfish.net/images_01/diamond_jewel_fish_w360.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariumfish.net/images_01/di...</a><br>  <br>   Second favorite would be a Bumblebee Cichlid, even though they are common and cheap I like the way they look.<a href="http://www.ratemyfishtank.com/images/thumbimg/6316_25.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.ratemyfishtank.com/images/thu...</a>|`|W02kTOqmaa	As far as dwarfs, I love the rams, lol.<br>  <br>  Larger cichlids, I love O.

fOLO4TNhaa	A dog displaying this type of behavior at such a young age MUST have a chemical Imbalance in there brain.<br>  <br>  Happens more and more these days to puppies.<br>  <br>  I have known sooo many people that get these types of puppies by mistake.<br>  <br>  In the end they MUST put the puppy down. Cassie a Top Contributer, had a beautiful puppy that had the same issues that had to be put down due to an Chemical imbalance in his brain.<br>  <br>  Its unfortunate. But first you got to think about the dogs quality of life. How will he feel having to live separate? How does he feel as of right now? is he always in an aggressive state? Nothing likes to live like that. <br>  <br>  I suggest you take him to your vet and let them run some test to see if it is indeed a Chemical Imbalance.<br>  <br>  Then its totally up to you whether to keep him going like this or having him put down?<br>  <br>  I am so sorry.<br>  <br>  I just hope its not this and he is curable. GL!<br>  <br>  ADD: Thats other thing, do you believe that your little guy will have a good quality life being sedated all the time or getting those shots? Really think through this is it really worth all this?? Whatever your choice, i am with you on it all the way :) Good luck!<br>  <br>  ADD: I agree, if i was in the situation i really don't think i could have one of my dogs put down. I am sorry your in this situation, i hope alls well and you do what you thinks best.|`|3z0NLTGYaa	First, have a thyroid panel and a lyme test done on the JRT.  If those come back clear, then you need a behaviorist, not a regular trainer.  Institute NILF (Nothing in life is free) and keep the dogs seperated unless you can supervise.<br>  <br>  The foster pup needs to go back to the rescue and you should shelve those aspirations until you resolve your current issues.<br>  <br>  If your vet has no other suggestions, I'd find another one.|`|L22hVXTIaa	First, keep the JRT away from the other dogs!  <br>  <br>  Then, check into a professional trainer.<br>  <br>  ADD:  If you've already consulted with a professional trainer and vet who believe the dog can not be rehabilitated, then the JRT will have to live a life separate from other dogs and people.<br>  <br>  ADD:  I didn't say he couldn't be rehabilitated - You said your vet and professional trainer said there was nothing that could be done - we can't evaluate the dog, but apparently they did.  Sorry, I have nothing else to offer you.|`|XoAavDz8aa	Sounds like there was some social problems when the dog was removed from the litter.  This could potentially be due to early removal which is a common problem.  During the early stages of puppyhood, between 6 to 10 weeks, the mother begins diciplining the pups and a sense of respect and social order is established.  Sounds like this puppy never learned it and is taking it upon himself to dominate the other dogs through play fighting, a behavior learned between the ages of 3 to 6 weeks of age.  The problem is that he has not learned boundries properly and has taken it too far and with such smaller pups.  <br>  <br>  The behavior is correctable however it will take a lot of time and patience.  Everytime he snaps he is going to have to get a correction wheather through a choke chain or grabbing by the scruff and pinning him to the ground.  If a toy is involved then take it away.  If you can anticipate the behavior such as him acting out when someone tries to take a bone then you can manipulate it by turnning it into a game of tug-o-war.  This turns a bad thing into a positive one.  The concept is to punish bad behavior while rewarding good.  Don't give him toys to play with or simply give him food.  Make him work for it.  Give him commands to do before he gets anything.  This will help distract him from the other dogs and make him focus on playing with you.  <br>  <br>  Like I said it will take time and patience but you have keep him well rounded. There is no one thing that will fix him but rather a combonation of things from exercise to dicipline to socialization.  Separating them will only make him more skeptical of other dogs but I would limit their interaction at first.  Perhaps only allow them near each other under close supervision and without toys or even with a baby gate in between.  Then gradually introduce them.<br>  <br>  Addition:  I'd hate to say it but there are some trainers who have lots of credentials but only experience with specific types of dogs.  If the trainer has not had experience with a dog of this situation then he may not be qualified for this particular problem.  Check with a local humane society or SPCA.  They can probably help with temperment testing and developing a rehabilitative program for you.  As far as the vet there isn't much a vet can do.  I don't agree with sedating the dog because it could create other health problems.|`|AA11457471	Please tell me this dog is neutered!!!!<br>  <br>  Yep, a behaviorist is the way to go. <br>  <br>  You must return the foster pup since you cannot guarantee it's saftey right now.<br>  <br>  JRT's can be really tough to deal with.|`|5PsKGss7aa	I highly suggest looking into a behaviorist in your area.|`|c5eeba4eae0b989e5215d3cd6ec48329aa	The dog needs to be put down if there is nothing medically wrong.  You seem dead set against that idea, but imagine, if the thing is that aggressive, how unhappy it must be.  You are not doing him or anyone else any favors by keeping him alive.  And you might lose your house, or your future earnings to a bite victim.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Oh, it sounds like your JRT has a hard wiring problem in his brain. He is very young to be showing such aggression.<br>  <br>  Brendon, you need to think very seriously about this situation.  Have you had a qualified behaviourist see the pup?  If there is a way to help this pup then a qualified and cluey behaviourist is the only way to find out.  Maybe there is no way to help him but I sincerely hope there is. Shyte, he's only a puppy!<br>  <br>  That he has bitten a human as well as seriously injuring another dog is not a good sign at all. Most dogs at 6 months of age don't attack baby puppies. <br>  <br>  What demons does he have that makes him behave this way?  As you said, it comes from nowhere.<br>  What will his life be like if he needs to be kept away from other dogs as well as people? <br>  What will your life with him be like?<br>  <br>  Sorry, I'm not at all helpful with all my questions but these are questions I would be asking myself if I were in your position.<br>  <br>  EDITED TO ADD: I believe it's unlikely to be a hormone related problem in a 6 month old puppy.  All of his hormones haven't even kicked in yet.<br>  Have the vet do a full T3 and T4 thryroid panel on him, not just the preliminary test.<br>  Please keep us posted about him.|`|AM7CgQ4daa	Hi Brendon<br>  I have seen quite a few of your questions lately.<br>  The first thing to do is get rid of the foster puppy, the last thing you need is more dogs, so return it.<br>  I can't remember what your 4 month old is now,  but you have to keep these dogs separate.  Have a crate or playpen in the room, and rotate them so they are never left alone again.<br>  Consider getting the 4 month old re-homed.  It is obvious your older dog has issues, it is not fair to keep going this way, if you can not cope give some of these dogs another chance, no matter which one you decide to keep.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	I think always separating dogs that don't get along only intensifies their fixation on each other. In your case, the jack Russel's fixation only will intensify when he does eventually get in contact with one of the other dogs. Separating isn't solving the problem, its only band aiding it. I think you are the only one that can truly make a difference, in establishing balance and structure with in the household. If your dog wont even think of being aggressive towards you, that shows hes definitely got some sort of respect for you. I assume you are familiar with Dog whisperer with Cesar millan, i think his techniques would definitely work with your case, being a dominant aggressive type case. His techniques apply pack mentality which i believe is highly effective.
L22hVXTIaa	Try the commercial food supplements; <br>  <br>  Distaste or Deter - you can buy them at Petco and Petsmart.  These will keep her from eating it.  <br>  <br>  But, if she's not eating it - only bringing it into the house (YUK!) then she should get a very sharp verbal reprimand.  When she brings it in - clap your hands loudly to startle her, tell her to drop it and then tell her "NO!"<br>  <br>  This, coupled with diligent yard clean up, will hopefully resolve the situation.|`|AA11457471	Golly gee.....lemme think.....wait....I think I've got it!<br>  Pick up the poop as soon as they go!<br>  If the yard stays poop free that should solve the problem!|`|5PsKGss7aa	Maybe she is saying to you "You have not cleaned up the yard and i like it clean,guess I'll do it myself".<br>  hah..<br>  On a serious note though, pick it up faster.<br>  <br>  You should also mention what you are feeding her..<br>  It could be the food too is a problem.|`|8IfePMa3aa	It's very simple: all you have to do is clean the yard up....which a responsible owner should be doing anyway.
hQQuqyYcaa	First of all, NO bowl is good for a betta. They should have a heater and filter with at least a 5 gallon tank. They do survive in either plastic or glass bowls, but they don't thrive. The betta will be a lot happier and healthier in an actual tank with a filter and heater.|`|AA11708471	It is not what is made of its what it is <br>  A BOWL<br>  <br>  No fish should live in a bowl especially tropical fish like bettas that need heated water.|`|jBh36NTzaa	DO NOT USE PLASTIC BOWLS. After a while the chemicals from the plastic will seep into the water and will kill the fish. You can have it in a bowl but its a lot more work. You will have to change the water more often(every other day). If you get a bigger tank 5 gallons being the minimum then it will be less work and plus more room for the beta to be happier.|`|aeonmRR2aa	Bettas can live a miserable, unhealthy life in a plastic bowl just fine.  Or they can live a long, happy, healthy life in a 5+ gallon tank with a heater, filter, gravel, and some decorative objects like rocks or plants (fake or real).<br>  <br>  It's really for you to decide what kind of owner you want to be.<br>  <br>  As a side note, when I see bettas in tiny cups at fish stores, they all look like they're half dead and waiting for the other half.  It's pathetic.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Bettas (siamese fighter fish) can survive in bowls but will only thrive in at least a 2.5 gallon with a filter and heater.|`|tsdutDH9aa	depends on what type of plastic and what chemicals it has. but definitely glass is the way to go. !
B6zl0AJDaa	That's a bit expensive depending upon where you want to board.  Here in Kern county, CA I can get a 24' x 24' pipe stall with feed, water and cleaning for $130.00/mo.  Pasture with feed and water for $125.00/mo.<br>  <br>  Of course if you're in the San Francisco Bay Area there are places with just pasture, hay and water for $350.00/mo and you're NOT allowed to ride your horse!  (It's a retirement pasture!).<br>  <br>  Of course you may want to weigh full care with the cost of your gas, time and hay (Here for a 3 strand 125LB bale of alfalfa you're paying close to $20.00/bale and an easy keeping horse would use 5 bales per month.|`|QTT9380Yaa	I would only pay about 200.

Nothing more.|`|5M57TTfpaa	i wouldnt want to pay more than like 100, because your doing everything, but i dont know how much they normally run.|`|UvBK3p9raa	Self-care board in my area currently runs $50 - $150/month for reasonably priced places.  Prices vary due to location and amenities of the facility.  There are a few facilities that do mainly full board that try to charge around $275/month for a couple self care stalls, but they have a hard time keeping these stalls filled.  Good luck in your search!|`|zMXDolD9aa	Well, i'm in the UK and that's known as DIY here (don't know if it is where you're from!)<br>  Anyway. At the last stables i went to it was ￡35 per week for just the stable and something like ￡2 per bale of straw for the bedding, so it wasn't expensive. That makes it around $200 a month, in American currency.<br>  It also had a riding arena and quite a large amount of fields.<br>  It depends on the facilities aswell, really! I'd pay around $200-$250 per month at a DIY yard|`|58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	I'm in the UK and my stable rent is ￡75 per month, which includes year round turn out and use of a sand school.<br>  Of course, all the extras add up, like bedding, forage, feed, etc.<br>  <br>  In all, doing all the work myself, it still costs about ￡500 per month to keep both my horses to a good standard.|`|6EP7ILr3aa	I pay ￡40 a month for a stable and field. Im in england though so im not sure what difference there is between the dollar and pound. My horse lives out 24/7 but i still have a stable to tack up and feed in. Its all DIY.|`|BI1GbIZUaa	In my area that would cost about $250 a month. The wear on the land is basically what you're paying for. A stall will also run you more then if your horse is living in a field 24/7
JiCKFTuIaa	It never takes longer than a week. That doesn't mean not to expect accidents once in a while tho' . Pups can get distracted and forget until it is to late just like children can.<br>  <br>  Simple reason why it takes some people so long is that they sit there and watch the pup go, say "damn it did it again" , and take the dog out on schedule two hours later like some idiot told them to.<br>  <br>  edit<br>  sure can tell that some on here just sit watching their dog poop on the floor saying "golly-gee" instead of getting up off their butts and doing something about it, can't we. <br>  ROFL @ the TDs<br>  <br>  edit#2<br>  "Also IF the person is elderly its harder on them and they aren't consistant on the training.'<br>  <br>  Ah-WHAT!!<br>  I'm 70|`|9kTejB0uaa	I think a lot of it is down to the fact that these days, people are working, and simply not around to get on top of the house training issue.  You do need to be there, and to be consistent with what you do.  People just expect it all to fall into place without putting in the work/time.<br>  <br>  But there are some that are more difficult to train than others - and in truth, I was never totally convinced that my Bassets were solid in their house training!!  It was more down to me being there at the right time lol.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you were just dead lucky - or have a paragon of virtue !!!|`|3BMBZtDxaa	Years?? Months?? Wow.<br>  <br>  I guess some people have a hard time doing it. They probably are going about it all wrong. <br>  <br>  With me, it takes the most one month. That's with dogs who've never known the concept and are rescued dogs. But most other dogs, a week or two. I don't get why it would take 3 or 4 months!<br>  <br>  It's even simpler now with crate training. All you need to do is put them in the crate while you're gone so you know they aren't going while you're gone. When you're home, you just watch them close and when they're about to go, correct them quickly and put them outside. Encourage them once they're outside. I also teach the "go pee" command, and have a schedule. Really, it isn't that hard.<br>  <br>  Maybe they meant small dogs? Like they can't hold their bladder and the owner has work or something?<br>  <br>  But still... That's a long time!|`|tPGxPDvBaa	It depends on the age of dog & how often you let them outside.  Pups can't hold it for 8,9hr until they are 5mo or so.  Their bladders aren't large enough. It is the same way some babies wear diapers for longer than others.|`|fOLO4TNhaa	Agreed! I have no clue. I am guessing its with non consistent people. If you are on the dog at every waking moment of the day. It will not take months to train the dog. Actually with my current Chi-poo mix it took me one day to train her. Because that whole day i focused on her being potty trained- i did not let her have ONE accident. Its all about consistency. Its up to you, you can go the lazy way and take up to 5 months to train your dog or you can go the consistent way and really reinforce it and have them trained in days. I think it is all about the person and there consistency.|`|1Du4Rudvaa	I think it would depend on the age of the dog.  If you get the puppy when it is only a couple months old then it might take longer than a dog that is 5 months when you get it.  It also depends on the dog.  Some dogs are much more stubborn and take longer to accept a change.  The owner also makes a difference.  An owner that has house trained a dog before will generally be able to house train a dog faster than an owner that is training their first dog.  There are a lot of factors that play into how fast or slow a dog gets house trained.|`|26PPwzrWaa	The general rule is a dog is not truly housebroken until it goes 6 months min without going in the house. Most of that has to do with freedom and constant monitoring though.<br>  <br>  For some dogs, they immediatly take to going when and where they are supposed to. And their owners are very good with getting them out to go when they have to go. <br>  <br>  In rescue, you might get a puppy mill dog that just would go whenever in their crate etc. A lot of it depends on the dog. You never know what you might get with rescue dogs.<br>  <br>  To me, a puppy should be potty trainable within a couple weeks at most, but I am sure there are still accidents in the house on the rare occassion. An adult dog, It can depends on the dogs prior living situations.|`|W02kTOqmaa	It just depends on the breed, honestly. Every dog is different, and some dogs are just plain "slower" then others.<br>  <br>  Then you have certain breeds that are stubborn (like my sister's husky) who take a very long time.<br>  <br>  He is almost a year and she is excited because he has gone 6 days without an accident inside. Now mind you, she use to breed and show belgian tervurens, she is very experienced with training dogs. This dog is just very very, and did I say VERY, stubborn.<br>  <br>  Yes, I agree with you, my shepherds are always trained in a matter of days, but not every dog is perfect.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Some dogs are not completely house broken until they are a year old.  It depends on the size of the bladder, the willingness to please their owners and a host of other things.  Congrats to you for doing it in one week.  I've only had two dogs like that.  The rest have taken longer, including a stubborn terrier that finally was fully housebroken just prior to her first birthday.  I work full time as does my husband, so that also plays into it because we don't crate until they are six months old to keep them from learning to eliminate in their crates.  We also aren't around all day to correct them.  So, yes, it takes longer, but we understand that going into it.|`|eDySIDPQaa	I don't know why it would take anyone longer than 1-3 wks to house train a dog.......some dogs do resist this procedure so some may take a couple of weeks longer....it took me 5 days and Koda was trained...Bo came to me already trained....<br>  <br>  and Demon my Min. Schnauzer, he was 8 wks old when we brought him home and he was done in about 10 days,,,and that was it..<br>  <br>  The only dog I ever had a problem house training was a Rotti, I had back in the late 80's, he did not want to go outside to potty for nothing, now he took me almost a month..it was really funny, I kept up the walks, crated and the whole nine yards, then boom, he went to the door and wanted out and he was trained...so between the both of us being hard headed, he was a job......<br>  <br>  Some Brussells Griffon's are head headed and do take awhile to house train,....they are very strong willed...but once trained, they are great little house dogs.....some people have even said it is a well laid plan to get one house trained...LOL    sounds like the litlte dog has the owners bluffed huh.....|`|fMRcX2WDaa	i have no idea it only toke me a couple days to train my puppy with out a crate at 8 weeks old.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	I dont get it, either.<br>  <br>  I housebreak foster dogs on a regular basis, and it usually take me 2-3 days.  The longest its taken me is a week and a half, and I think in that case the weather was a factor (it was rainy and cold, and the dog did not want to go outside.)<br>  <br>  Of course, I have good role models to help with the training :o)<br>  <br>  *******<br>  Okay - I can see how a puppy might take longer.  The youngest dog I have trained was 9 months.   I train my dogs to use a doggy door, since I work all day.  I try to bring new dogs home on the weekend, so I can at least spend two whole days with them.<br>  <br>  I dont agree about the breed thing, though.  I have seen people comment on certain breeds being difficult (dachsunds and min-pins come to mind).  I have had both, and they were no more difficult than any other dog.<br>  <br>  Chihuahuas have taken the longest for me.<br>  I had a chihuahua who I found as a stray, and had for eight years.  There was a fairly long period with him that I have always referred to as the "poop wars".  But that was about power, not housebreaking.  He was trying to claim all the food in the house :o)|`|J5hsCONRaa	I have absolutely no idea. The only reason I can think of is that they give up on method after method when they dont work after a day or so. Or they just think they only have to "show" the dog where to toilet and it will remember, with no other training. So when it doesnt, they think the dog cant be house-trained.<br>  When I was fostering my guy, he was 8 weeks. He was asking to go out by 10 weeks. So no, I wouldnt say its hard, just a case of taking the time and effort to actually train constructively.|`|84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	I guess it's because puppies are not able to hold their pee for long until they're older. So even if you're dog is housetrained, he could still have accidents until he is old enough to completely control and hold his pee for a longer amount of time. <br>  And also it's a matter of right training. We just adopted another puppy on Saturday and I would say he is trained already. (he's 9 weeks old) He knows that he goes when he is outside. He pees everytime I take him outside. So far he only had 2 accidents in the house, but that was more of an excitement pee. lol<br>  If you do it right then it should go pretty quick, but yea 4 months or even a year is insane!|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	I own three dogs now, i have had dogs almost my entire life and i helped potty train them all, some learned in a matter of days some took weeks and some took a month or two.<br>   For instance i have two Papillons and one pomeranian, my female pap took about two months to fully train were as my male was pretty much potty trained when i brought him home. My pom took about two weeks to fully train  of course i got her at 6 weeks old, Now it's said that Paps are one of the hardest breeds to potty train and my female pap was very hard to train compared to other dogs i had trained, most of her accidents happened in her kennel. I think it really depends on when they started their training and how fast the dog picks up the training, how strong their bladders are and their age. every dog is different.|`|L3PiQ0GLaa	because you can't just show then one day and they will have it like that<br>  <br>  it takes time and all dogs are different some dogs it could take 1 or 2 months but thats really hard to do <br>  <br>  and sometime it really does take over a year it depense on how much time you train them every day<br>  <br>  i got my self a chow chow how wasn't housebroken and she was a year old and now she is two years and is just starting to get the point but i also got a 4 month old collie and she learn in 5 days so its not how long it takes it how fast the dog picks things up and how much time you train them everyday try letting them out every hour and don't let them in the house until they go potty then let them in and let them know they did good and if you see them sniffing the floor tell them to go out side and let them out and wait til they are done going before you let them back in|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	Crate train, or other methods are equally effective...I am a full time doggy mom, so I can monitor my dog 24/7, so the moment he shows sign, I take him out...so I never use crate training for housebreaking.<br>  <br>  When people say months, it is more about puppy.

Some just take a little longer to learn, or learned incorrectly in puppyhood and need to be retaught.|`|0IMf5SATaa	It's never taken my dogs long either but I can only imagine that it would take that long when there is no consistency in the training and the little mites are a bit confused.|`|KuUx34hCaa	I don't know it's crazy like you said it's consistency I can train a pup in a few days with out a crate & I have raised & breed dog for over 60yr.|`|ld2vmypNaa	Inexperience....<br>  does NOT think to research  or ask what to do ...<br>  <br>  Also IF  the person is elderly its harder on them and they aren't consistant  on the training.|`|um5CVvTfaa	Because some of these people are talking about YOUNG puppies that can't hold their bladders the number of hours they are alone.  My pup is almost housetrained-- I sometimes miss her signals and she goes on the rug next to the door.  She is 4 months old.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	The answer is simple -- it does not take the dog that long to learn -- it takes the owners that long to get the hang of things. <br>  People who work long hours, or do not use a crate, or R just plain inconsistent, all have problems house breaking a pup. So the dog training manuals allow for this when thy give instructions. Maybe it just makes the owners feel better, as in they don;t feel so stupid. <br>  A puppy can be housebroken in 3 days or less if U put your mind to it. Bring the baby home on Friday, and by the time U go to work on Monday the puppy is safe in it's crate. Some people just do not understand a pup's rhythm & rhyme.

That is a criminal act. If there was something wrong with the dog then they could have took it too a vet.

My aunt did that to a litter of new born kittens, she put them in a bag and drowned them in the creek by her house, I was so pissed off at her but I was just a little kid when she did it and I actually didn't find out what she did until I was older and by then it was too late to do anything about it.|`|0fviV0lNaa	They should be sent to jail.

It's just plain cruel. In many theories i think they should get the same sentence for murdering an animal as humans do for killing others.

There is something VERY VERY wrong with you and I can only hope you don't breed to spread your mental illness to another generation. <br>  <br>  I can 'kill' an animal that needs to be put to sleep...<br>  I can 'kill' an animal if I'm going to eat it...<br>  <br>  But to kill an animal for no reason other then your own innate cruelty? That is inhuman...<br>  <br>  A person that does that shouldn't just not be allowed a 'pet' or access to animals... They shouldn't be allowed near children or the elderly either... <br>  <br>  They, personally, should be beaten for such actions... <br>  <br>  BTW... That is a CRIME... A felony in most cases...<br>  <br>  If you do know someone that did that, call the POLICE. The state/city has animal welfare officers that will come by and take your statement and if they can find evidence they will arrest that person and can fine them or even put them in jail for doing such a horrible thing. <br>  <br>  Animals may be put down in shelters if they can't find a home but killing a dog just becasue you are too lazy to take it to a shelter and give it a CHANCE at a happy life is totally unexceptable.|`|zL1sggpCaa	Irresponsible?!

se27sAUwaa	I know the feeling buddy. I've never owned a cat before, so it was completely new to me. My hands look like a coal miners', lol. He's playing with you. You need to go get one of those cat toys on a wand. I just got it yesterday and my kittens are going WILD. And buy one of those like $9 cardboard scratching boxes. <br>  <br>  I know it hurts but try to keep in mind that he is playing with you. (They also give little love bites.) When my kitten does that I hiss at her. Yes, I said hiss (like a cat) and tell her "NO!". She stops right away. Then I tell her good girl a bunch of times and pet her. It's going slow but getting much better. <br>  <br>  PS: No hitting or spraying in the face. The water can really hurt his eyes and eventually he's going to associate the little "nose-punch" with you. The spray is good, just not in the face. Cats have excellent memories, so don't do anything physical. One of the first things you learn in animal training is startle, startle, startle. Don't scare the crap out of your cat, but do enough to distract/startle them out of their course of action. Thus, hissing for me b/c she does not expect me to do it and I make it abrupt and loud when it really hurts.|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behavior.  Just like a dog, but saying the word "NO" loud and firmly will help.  Say "NO" move him away from you and ignore him for awhile.  Also, your cat at this time have a lot of energy, and you need to have playtime with him.  You will need to go to pet shop and pick up a cat noodle (pet store will know what I mean) or cat string... where they can chase it around the house.  Need to burn those energy.  Next time when you tap his nose, use the hand signal "NO" firmly.  I have a free DVD from SPCA to teach you on raising kitten.  Let me know if you need it.. I can sent it to you for free..|`|1H0vYaJxaa	this is how kittens play. now is a good time to start to cut its nails. get a pair of human nail cutters and get her used to them and cut away. If the cat is acting hateful then you may want to think about fixing them a lot of the times it will calm the animal down.|`|KvVCbaI7aa	That's how kittens play just keep his claws clipped so it doesn't hurt as bad when he scratches you. Spraying him with water works for when he jumps up on the counter or goes places you don't want him to but you can't do anything about him biting or scratching. I have two cats and they still bite and scratch. If you don't want to play just ignore him and he'll find something else to play with.|`|JlVzCnTJaa	haha its  a kitten..its usual for it to be all playful and starts chewing on stuff..like my old kitten used to bite the tip of my toes xD but then he stopped later on..by the way dont spray it with water hes still young :)..or even when he gets older lol<br>  <br>  have fun! x]|`|z2bVBZ7Zaa	you can't stop it, that's how kittens play and how they tell you that they love you, that's what kittens do!|`|PfS5LiWbaa	Get it a play house thing that's covered with carpet and don't get on to it i have found out if you do care for them doing it then they don't care to do it it's like they want to get in trouble.LOL
nMuDw3Nzaa	A lot of people will probably say to listen to your parents, and I think they should shut up because you asked for ways to persuade.<br>  Now, I helped my friend get her mom persuaded and it will be awhile, but she got her mom to say yes and is getting two male rats.  Rats are clean, cleaner than cats even. They are great pets and animals.  Now, If i were to explain a bunch of things about rats and give you tips, it would mess up like it always does, so please follow this link to my answer which got a best answer--<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuyChS0Dcw3li7DaXtDlWHTty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221210759AAvPqbR&show=7#profile-info-Czh1fbQgaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  now, have you let them know how clean rats are?  That is always good.  If you have a friend who has rats, then you should ask them to show your parents and prove with experience from them how great they are. Also, you should tell the that no matter whjat happens you will care for them and they will not have to hlp one bit. If you don't really mean this, just wait until they like the rats.  My parents aren't too fond of rats, but even my mom, who only touches them if I hold them \very tight and they have just had a bath and she is feeling like it, goes into my room to check on them and watch them sometimes.  <br>  Also, are you able to pay for continuous food and water supplies?  My parents pay for that, because there is no way for me to get money except as gifts....  And how much money do you have to pay for this? If you get two rats and all of their supplies, then the most you will probably use is $40.  But I wasn't counting the cage. To get a good cage you may need to spend a hunred dollars, or close.  To fine good cages, email me at lynxlover623@yahoo.com  and I will give you all the cages I reccomended to my friend. If you have more money to spend i can recommend more.  Also i can give you a cage calculator, which if you enter the dimensions of a cage, it will tell you how many rats you can comfortable fit into it.<br>  <br>  Now, If you hated rats I wouldn't be persuading this, because I wouldn't want rats in your care. But if you really want them (and ignore anyone who says you will get bored of them--it isn't true)  then I will help you as much As possible.  If you don't like using a bunch of points, just email me, or if you want  many answers from people but hate using points then I will ask for you even--I don't care aboiut stuff like that. I get on yahoo answers for occasional questions and to help people who love rats!<br>  <br>  If you need any more info or persuasion add on additional details and I'll check back. I didn't do a whole lot of persuading anywy, just mostly telling you things that you probably already knew.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Its your parents home.

o93EwErKaa	My Yorkie moms nurse until 9 or 10 weeks.  Is there a problem with the mom and you are trying to keep her from nursing for a reason.  If not, let her nurse.  You are right on schedule in feeding the pups, but they should continue to nurse until mom weans them in my opinion.|`|bIaywrBCaa	you seperated the mom from pups much too early. My pups usually stay with the mom until they go to their new homes.

The mom may have mastitis and needs to go to the vet.|`|qapJU3tMaa	Talk to your breed mentor.

If you can afford the parvaid it really does increase your odds and shortens the virus substantially and gets them eating in half the time.  Give her plain Pedialtye or the oat water solution found in the guide by syringe every hour on the hour around the clock.  It sounds like the diarrhea and vomiting are not that severe, but if they progress and you are unable to keep more fluids going in than are coming out ask your vet to give sub-q fluids.  Sub-Q fluids are fluids given under the skin and will form a hump on the back which will slowly be absorbed.

w1lh1INHaa	Liver disease (which is a catch all term for a number of liver issues) is not fatal if caught in time, and can be managed.  The liver has  remarkable ability to regenerate.  <br>  <br>  Fatty Liver Syndrome is generally accompanied by loss of appetite, thirst, refusal to eat/drink.  Your cat is eating and drinking well, so having to inject nutrients shouldn't be an issue.<br>  <br>  I have an oldster (18 in April) who has liver "issues" for a considerable amount of time, the offshoot of...well, we really don't know what, we think anemia, and just manage it.  He eats a high-protein, low fat, low/no grain diet of canned and raw food with, no, none, nada, zero, zilch wheat glutens, and no, none, nada, zero, zilch dry food.  I also add plant or fungal-based enzymes to his food.  <br>  <br>  Just bear in mind that liver issues can be an offshoot of another problem, and not necessarily specific unto themselves as  Bilirubin levels are increased in cats with liver disease, gallbladder disease or have excessive destruction of  red blood cells (known as hemolysis or hemolytic anemia) which could be a result of other non-liver issues such a leukemia, FIV, auto-immune issues, flea infestations, parasites (such as worms) and so on.  As my cat had a terrible bout of fleas which made him anemic, we have settled on that being the cause of the liver issue.<br>  <br>  So, until you know the underlying cause for the Bilirubin, don't drive yourself crazy trying to figure out liver issues.

You could check with your vet to see if there is a special diet food you could be feeding your dog if you are concerned.|`|V29gz6aTaa	I have two adult dogs: One 4 yr old Female boxer, and one 14 yr old mutt-mix.<br>  <br>  We feed them twice a day: dinner and breakfast. In the mornings we usually give them half a cup of kibble and mix it with half a cup of chicken. (ridiculous.. I know... but my mom insists on making my dogs gourmet meals...)<br>  <br>  In the evening, after we walk them, we usually give them twice the amount. It has been a long day and they have "worked out" on their walk, so we usually give them a cup of kibble and a cup of chicken.<br>  <br>  It also really depends on how much energy your dog/s have. Molly (the Boxer) has SO much energy-- more than double, probably, than my mutt. Therefore, we give her more than we feed him. <br>  <br>  You can always add or lessen the food amounts if you think that your dog needs more food, or if you think they're getting a little chubbs and think that they need less.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped!|`|UNqtjU3Kaa	Well, we feed our Golden Retriever the Hills Science Plan.<br>  <br>  We feed him twice a day, one after a walk in the morning, and the other after his walk in the evening, and we tend to feed him about 150g of food (1 1/2 cups) each time.<br>  <br>  So over a day, he has about 300g of food.<br>  <br>  =]|`|t2M1kXY4aa	I have 3 adult dogs.  They are fed once a day.<br>  <br>  They are 3 different sizes, so they each get a different amount.  I feed slightly less than the amount recommended for their weight per day.<br>  <br>  The big one (72 lbs.) gets 3 1/2 cups<br>  The medium one (41 lbs.) gets 1 3/4 cups<br>  The smallest (26 lbs.) gets 1 1/4 cups
IQezKzNEaa	You can calculate your dog's energy needs, and the energy content of the food you are feeding, and use these numbers to figure out how much to feed.<br>  <br>  1. How much energy does the food have in it?<br>  <br>  a. Multiply crude protein by 3.5<br>  <br>  b. Multiply crude fat by 8.7<br>  <br>  c. Figure out how much carbohydrates are in the food with the formula: (100 - crude protein - crude fat - crude fiber - moisture - ash) and Multiply that number by 3.5 <br>  <br>  d. Add a, b, and c together, and that is how many kcals are in 100 grams of food.  To use this number is the 3rd step, divide by 100.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. How much energy does your dog need?<br>  <br>  Figure out your dog's weight in kg, then input it into this formula:  2.0 x 70 x BW^.75<br>  <br>  This is for an adult dog at maintenance, not one that is growing, pregnant, lactating, or in old age.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. Divide #2 by #1, and you should get the number grams per day your dog should eat. <br>  <br>  ----------<br>  <br>  So, how many meals should your dog eat per day?  Ideal is to feed three meals per day.  Transit time (time for food to pass through) is 4-6 hours, so after that time, your dog is hungry again.  Three meals fed about five hours apart will keep your dog from starving during the day.  <br>  <br>  However, I only feed my dogs twice per day since I am not home in the middle of the day to feed them.  To help with this, I provide plenty of bones and toys to chew on to keep them occupied.|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	Hard to answer because I don't know what is the breed...a chihuahua eats very different than a giant breed dog.  <br>  <br>  So I can only use my dog as an example.  He is a Newfie.  I pretty much increase one cup every month till 6 mths old.  Then I use the rib cage as monitor...if he is too fat, I cut the portion, if he is too skinny, I up the cup little bit.   A leaner dog is a healthier dog.  Each dog is different...for example, my dog has 8 brothers and sisters...and the cup size ranges from 3 cup a day to more than 7 cups a day...|`|M2h3JF7Zaa	it depends on the size of the dog , it should say on the bag or can of food, or ask the vet how much they should be eating.|`|g5TyTEGsaa	Look at the feeding instructions on the back of the food. It goes by weight.
AoSeHXeQaa	I prefer to train a dog to only bark appropriately (like at people at the door, until I say its okay), rather than rely on a device.<br>  This is what I suggest:<br>  <br>  When he barks, get up, and check to see why he is barking.  If he is barking at something or someone you do not want him to bark at, tell him NO.  (For some dogs, this is all it takes).<br>  <br>  If he ignores you, reach down and touch him firmly on the neck, and repeat NO.<br>  <br>  If he is too focused on what he is barking at to respond, then get a small spray bottle (or even a water bottle), and splash or spray him.  Once you have his attention, then repeat NO.  After a couple of sessions, you shouldnt need the water any more.<br>  <br>  I am fostering a spoiled chihuahua who attacks the television.  All she has to do is see me pick up the water bottle, and suddenly she can hear me just fine :o)|`|OxFsslN8aa	I have a mini dachshund who is a barker.  This is what I have been doing and making slow progress:  I have taught her to "speak" by placing my hand at my mouth when she barks and saying "good speak".  When she is quiet I ask her to "speak" and she will bark once.  Now I can tell her "no speak" and redirect her attention to something else then give her a treat.  I have had her for 1 year and perhaps its because she is coming out of puppyhood but she seems to get this command now.  If I am outside with her she will not bark but if she is out alone she barks at the wind!  I always go out with her now.  I have read that some people teach their dogs "enough" which refers to all behavior and when they say enough the dog stops what it is doing; ie barking, begging, playing with them, fighting with the other dog.  <br>  <br>  My suggestion is to teach a command that your whole family will use and be consistent.  Use treats as positive reinforcement.|`|Hwybmzg5aa	congratulations for getting ripped of by a puppy mill for buying a designer mutt.|`|qapJU3tMaa	Barking is what these little dogs do best!

GfvxVeZMaa	Why aren't you allowed to buy from a breeder? Any animal is much healthier coming straight from a breeder, they also tend to be cheaper too. <br>  I got my three rats from a breeder and they cost a 10er, they cost 25-30euro in pet shops.<br>  And I'm pretty sure you can only get hedgehogs from breeders
1H0vYaJxaa	I wanted to start off and tell you that I am not a vet.<br>  <br>  I would go to the dollar store and buy some dewormer (or walmart). <br>  <br>  I understand that money is tight so if that is not a possibility then you need to keep extra water and food available for them, I would also get some bleach and clean you apartment thoroughly so that the cat are not reinfecting themselves. That would also include their litter boxes.<br>  <br>  As long as the cats are not loosing weight or blood is not coming out they should be fine. If they were in the wild they would be fine after nature took its course. <br>  <br>  As far as getting them to take the medication that you have for them. Get a towel and wrap the cat up (so that its face is the only thing exposed) and just put the medication down its throat. Then put the cat in the bathroom so if it vomits it won't be a huge mess. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	vet.<br>  sudden litter box problems are a sign of disease.<br>  <br>  worm meds should only be administered byua vet. unless you really know what you are doing, even then, the cat should be seen by a vet first to determine which one , of many , worms it could be.<br>  <br>  when you go out of town, leave a second or even third litter box out. next to the main litter box is fine. if they learn the box is sometimes dirty, they learn to go elsewhere rather then checking to see if it is clean.<br>  <br>  when they go where you can step in it, in the middle of the room, they are mad at you and getting even.<br>  this is your first warning, pooping on your bed is next.|`|AA10356572	the worm medicine you buy froma store wont kill all types of worms - go to the vet to find out what kind of worms your cat has and they will deworm the cat.. this might be part of the problem, but there are other causes too!<br>  <br>  here is a link that covers the causes and solutions<br>  <a href="http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Litter-Box-Training-Problems-in-Cats.77889" rel="nofollow">http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Litter-Box-...</a><br>  <br>  good luck|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	Sounds to me like stress. When you are out of town and they miss you. That's why the pooping outside of the box. Also, if there are a lot of poops in the box that could be the cause too. If you could get someone to go into your home and check on your cats while you are out of town that would help. Cats are very fussy when it comes to their boxes being soiled. My cat, 13 years old will hold it until I get the hint to clean her box out.<br>  <br>  As far as worming goes it's advisable to get a dab of butter or soft margarine and put the pill inside. Put the cats on a table and scruff the back of their necks. Hold them in a sitting position and pop the butter/pill as far back into their mouths as you can. Hold the mouth closed and rub the throat until they swallow the pill. I used to puff a little air into cats noses as that will make them swallow too.<br>  <br>  Some shelters and humane societies offer low cost or free medical help for people who can't afford veterinary care for their animals. Call a few places and see if any of them offer this service.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, I hope my advise helps!|`|g5TyTEGsaa	Your cats are most likely going outside the box because they are stressed out that you aren't home. As for the medicine, unless you know exactly which worm it is the medicine over the counter does not treat all of them. You should take a poop sample to your vet to have a fecal exam performed, basically they just look in the microscope and determine what kind of worm it is so they can treat it correctly. Both cats need to be treated even if you only see it on one because it can be transferred through the litter pans. Good luck!|`|w1lh1INHaa	The worms are causing a physical distress which is causing the cat to do the business outside of the box.  Deworming pills are not palatable to cats and they simply will not eat them when put in food.  You can try one of those "treats" that has a hole in the middle and put the pill in there...some find it successful, others, like me, find their cat eats around it.  The best way to get the med into a cat is pilling through the mouth.  I suggest you go to YouTube and look at some of the instructional videos on pilling a cat.  <br>  <br>  Deworming pills can be costly if your cat is not ingesting them or spitting them out, and it is important to get the proper medication at the proper intervals.<br>  <br>  Tapeworms generally come from fleas, so make sure your cats both have a topical flea treatment to control those.|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behavior.  2 things, one which happen to me.

Make sure to have someone comes in to clean. <br>  <br>  Worms are dangerous to cats, I advise for you to visit the vet.  Easiest way to get the worm out of their system.

vBIwaQ0qaa	I really don't think there is anything to worry about. Animals, like humans can get their off days too. She might be tired of all the playing she has been doing with your older cat.<br>  <br>  Appetite sounds good, eyes and ears are good too as well as wet cold noses. <br>  <br>  Just keep feeding her the way you have been doing. And keep a close eye on her in case of any change in her behavior. <br>  <br>  I don't see any cause for alarm. If in doubt, call a veterinarian for advice.|`|ErUBYE6Kaa	It does seem odd that all of a sudden after an entire week that she would just poop out. especially if shes not interested in eating either. i would be worried and just get her to the vet ASAP. Good luck. I'm a cat lover too. I have 5 (eek i know).|`|j9RtdcdOaa	Just give her a while to get used to your home maybe.<br>  Change up the food a little or something :)|`|0IMf5SATaa	Lift her scruff, if it settles back down immediately this is normal, if it takes a couple of seconds or more then this means she is dehydrated and is a sign of illness. Have a look at her gums if you can if they are very pale or very pink then this can be a sign of illness too (doesn't work with black gums). It is unusual for a kitten of this age to go off their food and mope around just because they are worn out from playing. Though its sort of hard to tell, you don't mention how long she has been like this, is it all day (ie she hasn't eaten at all) or just a few hours.<br>  Feel the ears, if they are too warm, this is another sign.<br>  <br>  Compare all these things with your older cat so you can tell the difference.<br>  Hope she's ok. Of course if in doubt take her to the vets.|`|1H0vYaJxaa	I would not worry about it. Like us cats have their off days. As long as the cat is not vomiting or acting "crazy" I would not worry about it. Just give her some time and see what happens. Think of it this way if the cat was outside what would happen? Nature would take its course and the animal would heal on its own if that be from exhaustion or just sadness.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	I would guess that the newness of everything has worn off and she's settling in.  The sudden increase in activity at first would have stimulated her appetite, making her eat more.  Now that she's settling in she probably will have a slight decrease in appetite (just not that hungry). As long as they're both still getting along, everyone has been vaccinated, her litterbox habits (and products) are the same and nothing else is changed, she's probably fine.|`|se27sAUwaa	I would say that if she is eating and pooping she's ok. Your kitten is probably starting to get used to her surroundings. I have a cat book from Animal Planet that says cats sleep 60% of their life. Kittens need lots of sleep b/c when they are awake they use so much energy bouncing around. If she hasn't improved by the time of your appointment just run it by the Vet (of course if she gets worse you should give your Vet a call). They can give a check and make sure she doesn't have a cold or worms.|`|zKyy1gE2aa	Any fluid coming from her nose? It could be several things, she could just have an upset stomach or a little cold. If she is new and hasn't had her shots yet, it could be Distemper. Try giving her some table scraps, Turkey meat or Chicken. My vet always told me if your animal won't even eat table scraps something is wrong and to bring them in ASAP. Maybe bring in some grass for her if you can, animals like to eat grass when they have an upset stomach.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Its always safest to bump up the vet visit, just to be safe.  You seem to be taking excellent care of her.  When you say you mix the dry with canned, was that what she was used to?  I would think stomach issues from a changed diet would have showed up earlier, and she would have had diarrhea prior to now but it might be part of it.  Has she been sleeping normally up to this point?  She may just be tired, but I would still take her to the vet just to be safe.  Never know =/|`|DN6XtoViaa	sounds like she is just exhausted from all the excitment shes had the last week.<br>  if its the first time shes been with another cat and shes been crazy playing with him then i would say shes just wiped out from all the playing!<br>  <br>  don't worry to much about it :) take her to the vet when you have planned. but i'm sure shes fine.|`|43eUq8hOaa	she is probably just wore out.Believe me,i have 6 dogs(one also just had 7 pups)4 cats and 3 horses.Just make sure when you take her to the vet,that you get her vaccinations.Good luck and give her kisses from me!!!|`|cHiv6eTWaa	I would watch her very closely for the next day and see if she bounces back to normal or gets progressively worse and lethargic.

A very playful and affectionate dog. Sweet and absolutely hilarious; they have a very comical personality and love to clown around. It is bright and easygoing. Curious and alert. The Frenchie gets along fairly well with strangers and other animals, but he often bonds strongly to one person. They play well with other dogs. Those Frenchies who are allowed to believe they are alpha may become dog aggressive. This breed needs leadership and will not thrive without it. The Frenchie cannot be owned and ignored. When they sense an owner is meek or passive towards them they will become fairly willful. They can be trained if the owner is calm, but firm, consistent and patient. Proper human to canine communication is essential. Do not give them affection or sweet talk them if they are displaying any type of unwanted behaviors, instead correct them sternly with a air of calm, authority. They are clean, and companionable, and enthusiastic, but they are not yappy and loud. This breed does best with considerate children who know how to display proper leadership. Frenchies are easy going to show. This breed may drool and slobber; however a good percentage of them do not. This little dog is also a ruthless hunter of mice! Do not allow this sweet little bully to develop Small Dog Syndrome.|`|2l7lbcJWaa	My best friend just got two. They were $1200 a piece. Honestly I think they are so ugly I would never get one. If I were you I would get another pug. <br>  <br>  here's some info <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/frenchbulldog.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/frenchbulldo...</a>|`|ks2z4po8aa	For almost 100 years, French Bulldogs were a very, very tiny breed club and the beloved companions of retirees, designers and a very limited / exclusive number of people in the United States... Now they're a popular breed and being mass-produced in puppy-mills around the world... Eastern Europeans and Latin Americans have exported thousands to the United States and they've found their way into US puppy-mills, pet stores and backyard breeders...<br>  <br>  Back in 1992, I paid a jaw-dropping $2800 for a French Bulldog that came with a mandatory spay clause and limited registration... Ethical hobby breeders are very exacting about protecting their bloodlines and properly health-screening their dogs... My precious dog lived to be 14 and was perfectly healthy her entire life... It took me another 10 years to add a second Frenchie into my fold because I would scrutinize each and every litter... Am blessed with 4 of them, all healthy, with good spines, no breathing issues, and zero allergies...<br>  <br>  Expect to pay upwards of $3000 for a female dog or above $2500 for a male puppy from an ethical and reputable hobby breeder... Anything below that and you're likely to get a poorly bred dog... Learn as much as you can visiting the national breed club at <a href="http://www.frenchbulldogclub.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.frenchbulldogclub.org</a> and contact the breeders on their directory... Another useful site is <a href="http://www.frenchbulldogz.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.frenchbulldogz.org</a> with a plethora of information and links... Unlike pugs that can birth puppies naturally, most Frenchies require artificial insemination and C-sections (at stiff costs)... The puppies also require round-the-clock care for the first few weeks of their life which is why they command such hefty prices... Pugs make great parents, but Frenchie females need assistance... It's very labor intensive and the fact that they tend to have smaller litters and higher-than-average fatality rates are other factors to take into consideration...<br>  <br>  Dogs from pet stores and backyard breeders can cost just as much or less-than-average but they're likely to be plagued by problems... Hemivertebrae, hip dysplaxia, luxating patellas, pinched stenotic nares, elongated soft palates, arthritis, calcification of discs are all problems that can crop up and there are thousands of people complaining about environmental and / or food allergies... <br>  <br>  As for well-behaved, this will always depend on the parents and their temperaments, the breeder, and the puppy's order in the litter... Dogs are all different though they have inherent traits... They can be well-behaved if a person makes the effort and reads books or attends dog-training sessions... Easy to house train? Most people will tell you that they're a nightmare... I find French Bulldogs to be the easiest dogs to potty-train and have never had a dog that wasn't perfectly house-broken by 16 weeks, but, in the reverse, you'll find hundreds of postings of dogs that suffer from copraphagia (eating their feces) or sleeping in their own pee... <br>  <br>  Good luck in your endeavors : )|`|LbJqU82waa	no! i have a british bulldog

Whenever someone has a snake that starts to miss meals it's  a ball python 90% of the time.<br>  <br>  Hognoses don't have to be cooled down or brumate(hibernate). Only breeders usually do this, and it's not even vital for reproduction to occur anyways.<br>  <br>  Kenyan Sand Boas are great first snakes, if you don't mid never seeing them.

KSB are burrowers some keepers keep them in sand, just make sure you do not feed them on sand due to health risks, impaction and the such. males will never usually need bigger than a 10 gallon tank too. they stay fairly small.<br>  <br>  Ball pythons are pretty snakes, known to be a bit snappy but i have never encountered one that was even the least bit aggressive. They do require a relative humidity of %60-%75 with an ambient temp of 82-85 and a basking spot at 90 they will reach an adult length of about 4-6 feet.<br>  <br>  Hognose snakes require a cage with a cool end in the high 70s and 80-82 on the hot end. the minimum cage size for an adult hognose snake is 10 gallons as well. also you can have them hibernate by cooling them, but if you don't cool them they will not hibernate, hibernation is only required if you want to breed them.<br>  <br>  hope this helps a little bit, sorry i don't know much about hognosed snakes.|`|JzDIux0daa	pretty much these are the differences<br>  <br>  tank-<br>  boa's grow about 8 ft..  so your looking at having to store a pretty big tank..  probably close to 100g<br>  <br>  ball pythons will need maximum 40g ( i have mine in a 20gLong)<br>  <br>  hognose again a 40 will do <br>  <br>  food- <br>  the bigger the snake the bigger the rat..  as an infant you can start them all on hoppers<br>  <br>  heat-<br>  your going to need an undertank heater (UTH) 1/3- 1/2 the size of your tank none the less.. depending on your tank size you may need a basking light 100-150w  <br>  <br>  habitat-<br>  boas like to be higher elevated..so you will need a taller tank<br>  hognose will climb aswell<br>  ball pythons chill on the ground<br>  <br>  each will need a cool cave and a warm cave<br>  <br>  for substrate|`|5Wuoi5bsaa	get a ball python for sure they are very docile snakes get to be 4 feet max some case a foot longer very rare though. super easy to feed too. balls are really neat to and cheapest out of all three. just in case you change your mind though i wouldn't go with a corn even though they really easy to take care of (balls are no different) they aren't very cool snakes they practically hide all day eat mainly dead, don't get very big and thick, and are very energetic snakes. and don't forget corns are good escapees. but back to topic. balls aren't very good at escaping if you have quarter of an cm thick bars for the lid of the cage and don't get sick easily. no special type of light is needed except infrared.<br>  <br>  hope this will convince u|`|0Y1RbF9gaa	Ball Python, in my opinion, i have one and it is not a pain to feed them|`|hOTrfGHEaa	ball python very docile i have 3|`|PIwP8DFxaa	ball pythons r by far the best|`|MX9M36B4aa	If this is your first snake i would go with the ball python and if you think they are a pain to take care of i would definitly not go with any other snake.Good luck and hope you make the rite choice.I would google all the ones you are interested in and look up the care on each one but again i think the ball pyton would be your best bet:)
PSiNv7gUaa	Not to seem rude, but if you have that many questions about hand-feeding, then you need to let the parents take care of it this time, do A LOT of research, then maybe next clutch you can try out hand-feeding.  They have to be at intervals throughout the day AND NIGHT, their food has to be a VERY specific temperature (too cold and it will spoil in their crop, too hot and it will burn their crop) otherwise you could kill them.  There is too much that could go wrong for a beginner who hasn't even done the research to attempt.
y0cbLn0Yaa	I have an 11 month old male Malinois, Bronson. He is the most entertaining, energetic and engaging dog.  Belgian Shepherds, in general, are extremely intelligent dogs and thrive on being with their family as much as possible.  They are highly trainable but you have to do this in a fair but firm way.  This breed will run rings around any owner who does not take the time and effort to train it.  This is not a breed to be left to its own devices in the backyard.<br>  <br>  I can imagine what a nuisance an untrained Malinois would be.  My 14 year old daughter is training our 27.5 kg Malinois and he responds to her beautifully.  I can't wait to see the 2 of them working together in the trial ring.<br>  <br>  I just can't emphasise enough how intelligent this breed is and how they need to have loads of physical and mental exercise.  They will "switch off" just not as often as most other breeds.<br>  <br>  They have to be really well socialised as pups as an unsocialised Malinois is a walking time bomb.  Make sure that the bit*ch you are getting has a really good temperament.<br>  <br>  In the past I have owned Groenendaels which are the long coated black Belgian Shepherds, essentially the same breed as the Malinois, just a different variety.  They were the most amazing dogs I have ever owned.  Great family pets, wonderful with the kids (dogs arrived before the kids) and fun to have around.  One thing I am noticing though is that my Malinois sheds constantly whereas the Groenendaels only had seasonal sheds.<br>  <br>  Also, my Malinois just loves the pool and we can't keep him out of there - always getting hair out of the pool.  It doesn't help when my daughter encourages him in there while she is having a swim to play his favourite game - "pool fetch".<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck and if you have any more questions please email me and I will be happy to answer them as best as I can.<br>  <br>  There are also Yahoo Groups for Malinois owners - show, obedience, agility, herding or just pets.  They are an absolute wealth of useful information.|`|W02kTOqmaa	Not much experience with the malinois. My mother use to breed belgian tervurens and show them, and she LOVED them. They were great dogs, very calm, and made great guard dogs as well. My mom would lay my sister in the yard when she was younger, and Big John, her champion male, would just lay with her watching her all day.<br>  <br>  Malinois have breen bred away from their original herding life, though. They are now usually bred as workers and guard dogs. They are very high strung and energetic, as most working dogs are. They need a firm consistent owner and handler. However, if you've had experience with german shepherds, I don't see this being a difficult breed for you to handle. Do you already know the female you are looking at? Spend time with her, get to know her personality and what she is like. Not every dog of a breed acts exactly the same way, each one is different. Maybe the breed as a whole isnt the right fit for you, but this female might be.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|PRG25iDIaa	Take a German Shepherd put in a smaller package and you have a  Malinois; They are great pets or working dogs, BUT they demand attention and work, just like the GSD. This is not a dog to leave in the back yard hour after hour, day after day. They are high energy, very loyal and in SchH can knock you down much harder than a GSD or Rotty. If the female you are looking at has not had basic obedience start immediately, they also normally love balls and freesbies; great with kids|`|AoSeHXeQaa	I've only known one, and it was HYPER.  (From what I have read, they tend to be really high energy)<br>  <br>  The people who owned the one I knew did not give it any training or discipline, just let it run on their property, so it was very badly behaved. It harassed their horse, and eventually jumped the fence and killed the neighbors goat, so they gave it away.

If it is a chain pet store, like Petco or Petsmart, they most likely won't. <br>  <br>  If it's a mom-and-pop type store and you have ALL the correct information in the booklet, they will probably more willing to hand them out. I have noticed that with a majority of these stores have the animal's best interest in mind and would rather sell an animal to someone who knows what they need to do in order to take care of it rather than give it to a negligent owner.<br>  <br>  Chain stores such as Petco and Petsmart have company policies that prohibit them from doing certain things and as far as reptiles go, all the ones I have been to are clueless as far as their care goes.

Are you doing a purchasers agreement when the pet store buys them? If so you should be able to put in there that they agree to give out the booklet when they are sold so it is in the best interest of the reptile. Just a thought, but I would check into it.
TNTFomKeaa	Generally, this type of horse is extremely popular and commands a decent price. That said, the market is flooded at the moment so you might be in luck. If you're going for an older horse, bear in mind that you could have problems insuring it for health problems and that you could well have to pay more on vet bills. Saving on the purchase price is not necessarily an economy.<br>  As you're a beginner, I assume you are taking lessons with an instructor and you are planning to board your horse where there'll be an instructor around to help you. Use these contacts. The best place to find a horse, especially a known horse without too many surprises, is through word of mouth. Tell everyone you know in the horsey world that you're looking for a horse and someone might just know a suitable one for sale.<br>  Also look in equestrian publications in your area for the classified ads. This is a good way to find a horse. Just make sure you visit it on more than one occasion and have it checked out by your instructor and your vet before buying.<br>  There are a lot of older horses being sold at auction in the US. Some of these might be suitable for you. Some might be old and lame. Some might be vicious. Sadly most of them end up being shipped off to slaughter. You could rescue one of these horses for a very decent price, but it's hard to know that you're getting a good one. I absolutely don't recommend that you buy from an auction yourself. This is only possible for very experienced people. Instead, try talking to horse rescue operations in your area. They often get older horses and auction horses and would be delighted if you could offer one a good home. You could see if your instructor would be prepared to buy at auction for you as well. <br>  I hope some of this advice is useful. Good luck!|`|V7Y9ldTUaa	I think you definitley can. Everyone has given you some good websites, you can also try craigslist, people are giving good horses away in my area simply becasue they can not afford to keep them.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	I think this is do-able, though you;d very likely be getting an older horse.  I would suggest that you don't limit yourself to just paints and QHs, though.  I would make sure you get a prepurchase exam on whatever horse you intend to buy, before you buy it.  Being a beginner, you are probably not as well equipped to deal with or as likely to notice potental problems.  You want to make sure that your horse will is sound enough to ride.|`|NIlgYM4saa	With the current horse market, its possible.

I've purchased several horses like that and have never paid more than $1000 for any horse.  I encourage you to consider a gelding though.  Mares sometimes have a tendency to be hormonal and bitchy.  Also, be open minded about color or looks.  Horses that fit your criteria are not always the flashiest or "prettiest" horses but are worth their weight in gold.  Be sure that no matter what you get the horse vet checked before hand.  This could save you tons of heartache.

However you have to accept partial blame for the death. You waited until the pup was sick for 6 days before taking him to the vet. If he had been taken in the first day or 2 he may have made it. Not sure how a court would rule in this case.

There is conformation. obedience, agility, tracking amd other things as well. <br>  There are also other show giving organizations other than AKC. So if your pug is not registered U can still show at different types of shows.

FG5NbqO0aa	Like you, I started when I was 12 going on 13, but our shelter has a kid/teen group so parental advisory isn't needed. I'll be 17 soon, and I haven't stopped since. I've also picked up another shelter along the way. So that's two down- in four years. <br>  <br>  What I've learned is invaluable. First off- listen to EVERYTHING the people say around you. Even if it sounds silly, you may find yourself referring to an idea, a sentence fragment, or just a simple statement someone said later on. What one of my shelters won't allow, is us cleaning/feeding the kennel dogs ect.. But we get to cuddle dogs and cats, as well as help clean the other places in the shelter, walk the dogs, help hold adoptathons, and I've even got to assist the vet. The other one, I have a lot more freedom at. They allow me to clean cages/feed/walk/play with/adopt out dogs and cats, but that's because I have animal experience. My biggest tip? <br>  <br>  NEVER and I mean NEVER take your eyes off of the animal. You have be a constant watcher of body language in the animal. And even then you can't always catch it. <br>  <br>  Example?<br>  <br>  Last Saturday I was at the shelter, and they asked me to show a dog to a family. This huge family of seven people came in, they didn't speak english well- but I'm sorta fluent in spanish, and they had 3 little kids. The dog I had, was very strange. And while I was talking, I didn't take my eyes off of the dog. It may seem rude, but its worth it, because the little kid was way to close to her face for comfort. Therefore I asked him to back up, and the Dog wasn't tense- she was just standing. I wasn't tense, and there was no real way to tell. Suddenly she just lunged. She caught the boy on his head with her paw, but had I not been watching and grabbed her and removed her right away, it would have escalated. That's how fast everything happened. <br>  <br>  Another tip I have, Is never hug or love on the dogs. Shelter dogs are unpredictable, and you don't know their complete backgrounds. It may be a strong urge for sure, but don't. I've seen two teens get bit in the face because they hugged a shelter dog. Not smart, but it wasn't the dog's fault either. And when you're going through. Don't stand in gront of a barking dogs cage. If the dog is barking/growling/cowering or anything to suggest aggression or fear, standing in front of it, causes the dog unnecessary stress. Plus you may get bit. <br>  <br>  And yet another tip!<br>  <br>  Don't let dogs co mingle. If you're walking a dog, and another is coming, pull over and let them pass. If you find yourself in a dogfight situation- DONT try and break it up- you could get injured, or injure the dogs. Let a experienced staff member handle it, and don't let your dad break it up either- because that could be a liability via stupidity. <br>  <br>  If you just listen, and keep your wits about you- I guarantee you'll have and be one of the best volunteers. Volunteering is a great experience, and I plan on doing for a long time. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zgO9LFb5aa	They will make you clean,walk dogs,fill the food and water bowls and thats mostly it trust me I am a vol. at a shelter and im 11|`|RT8LZy7gaa	Some sample tasks are:<br>  <br>  Socializing cats (petting, playing, brushing, feeding). <br>  <br>  Washing dishes. Changing out bedding.<br>  <br>  They may let you help wash the dogs.<br>  <br>  Walking dogs or playing with them in a play yard. (at your age they may only give you small dogs to walk or let you walk larger dogs with an adult present)<br>  <br>  I would think anything that involves excrement (poop) they would avoid having you clean it up, but I may be wrong. I volunteered as an adult so I'm not sure what the guidelines for minors are.<br>  <br>  You and your dad are doing an AWESOME thing! Keep up the great work!|`|iGGKYES9aa	I volunteer/ work at the kennel and foster dogs for a local animal rescue.  I'm not exactly sure what your local shelter would have you do, it depends on the shelter.  I can guess that they would have you walk small/ medium size dogs, play with them maybe even brush them if the dogs are ok with being groomed.  I have had my son come to work with me and had him wash dishes.  You could pick up poop in the yard.  When we get teenage volunteers that are older than 16 they can help clean the kennels by scooping the poop, and scrubbing them with bleach and water, or sweeping the front room or kennels (we use wood chips in some kennels) and mopping.  There is laundry to do and water and food buckets to be washed, too.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	One of the first things a new volunteers has to do is muck out the pens.

I know I done my share of it.  <br>  <br>  There is feeding & watering the dogs.  Brushing & bathing,<br>  <br>  It just depends on the kennel & what kind of help they need.  You may be doing a variety of things.|`|PQXiXEZKaa	they let you walk the dogs, feed them, clean the cages, check for any noticable problems.. etc. <br>  <br>  older people get to help people interested in adopting, wash the dogs, groom them. .

2821e642f26e1d2d0daab24df234f001aa	I feed my 3 dog Innova EVO.  I didn't want to feed 3 different kinds of food for each dog so I had to find one that all 3 could eat.  One of my dogs is allergic to grains (so the food has to be grain free), one is allergic to beef (so it can't contain beef or buffalo) and the third one is allergic to artificial preservatives (so the food has to have all natural preservatives).  Also I've found that the initial purchase price might be a little more, but they eat less of this food than they would a cheaper food so it doesn't really cost much more to feed them a better quality food.  <br>  <br>  I like to rotate their food every 5 mo. or so.  Some of the other foods I feed them are:<br>  <br>  Natural Balance<br>  Timberwolf organics<br>  Solid Gold<br>  <br>  In the past (before I knew what was causing their allergies) I've fed them:<br>  <br>  Nature's Variety<br>  Wellness<br>  California Natural<br>  Fromm<br>  NRG<br>  <br>  There are a few other good foods out there too that I know I missed.|`|02702f1398ac3a9b48ad043168f8f55caa	After some trial and error my puppy decided that he only likes  Purina Beneful with some Iams Savory Sauce mixed in.

595f3bfe8d33b586c005798eb2eee862aa	Bear in mind the following..........you CANNOT force 2 animals to get along.<br>  <br>  Be that as it may, more than likely it's just a question of the pit is establishing "who's boss"......the heirachy they will follow through thier lives.  There is ALWAYS an Alpha......the dominant dog will ensure that all others follow their lead.<br>  <br>  The trick is to allow the natural formation of this relationship, but not allowing it to get out of hand.  Since you are the "master", you must enforce your self as the Alpha, thereby ensuring that your lead dog doesn't get carried away.|`|10d4cde2ceb77265f9bf2c7a4b8ae5f3aa	your Pitt bull thinks that she is the alpha dog and does not accept your other dog and in the wild this is what they would do they would make a leader and the pack would follow after and the alpha dog will choose who is in the pack and who is not and your Pitt bull thinks that she is the alpha dog so you have to prove that  your other dog is also in charge by maybe feeding her first (as the leader always eats first)|`|20244512d33d2e4edb6c55c4bcd03bbaaa	Weener dogs are the best dogs.

LzXZQBHbaa	Like others have said...it's not the engine alone that matters. It's the wheel base too.<br>  <br>  Although,<br>  <br>  lol...I'm one of those that hauls my horses in a rinky dink stock trailer and a F150. I must say...I've never had a problem. My little F150 has a motor that doesn't have a problem in any way, shape or form in hauling my horses. It has the correct wheel base. Exact wheel base as my F250. I hauled my horses from South Dakota to Georgia with that F150 and the rinky dink stock trailer too. I get 15 miles to the gallon in the F150, which is why I choose to drive it. I do drive a little slower when using that truck and hauling my trailer but I don't see anything wrong with that.|`|LOH6UVh7aa	If it was me, I would NEVER haul any of mine, not even one at a time, with that vehicle(BMW)! You need a MINIMUM of 114 inch wheelbase to control the trailer full. I would NEVER jeopardize my horses in that manner.

You can say what you want,  do your homework & you'll see the BMW is NOT a safe car for hauling horses!!!! Period! The motor has NOTHING to do with handling the trail it is about being about to control the horse trailer full. & The BMW CAN NOT!!!!!!!! It is NOT a safe horse hauling car!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Don't get upset because I said I would never put my horses in that kind of danger. & you did.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	I think what the other posters are getting at is the wheel base and WEIGHT of your vehicle pulling the trailer.<br>  <br>  At one point when I started out hauling in 1974 (That's 35 years ago) I hauled a 2 horse bumper pull trailer (Known as a Pomona rig) with a 1965 Pontiac Bonneville 4 Door.  Because Pontiacs are known for their WIDE trackin' and this was a VERY heavy car, I NEVER had an issue.<br>  <br>  Since 7/75 I've never pulled a horse trailer with anything but a 3/4 ton pick up.  Matter of fact although the trucks have change in make and model, the 1975 king 2 horse bumper pull has remained the same.<br>  <br>  I would VERY seriously look at how the GTW of your BMW  compares to the GTW Loaded of your trailer as well as the width.  Folks USED to haul horses in the beds of their pickups with stock racks too but because of the height vs width it became a VERY dangerous way to haul, especially if you have a 4WD vehicle.|`|RloOJ43haa	Goosenecks are generally considered more stable because the truck both carries and pulls the load. The gooseneck hitch also moves the load closer to the center of gravity of a tow vehicle.<br>  <br>  EDIT - American Made and Rosie raise a very valid point. Horsepower is only one componet of a tow vehicle. You also need a minimun 114 inch wheel base for stability for a two horse trailer. What is the wheel base of your BMW? Have you ever checked? You also need to look at the balance of the tow vehicle. The higher the center of gravity, the more likely you are to roll. SUV's roll more easily that cars because they have a high center of gravity. You justify using the BMW as the tow vehicle because you 'have never had any problems.' I wonder how many accidents you need to have to get you, your horses, and/or innocent bystanders killed. Just because you see others hauling horses in a 'rinky dink stock trailer' and an F-150 does not make it right and does not absolve you of the responsibility of hauling your horses safely.<br>  <br>  A BMW may be 'the ultimate driving machine.' That does not mean that it is also 'the ultimate towing machine.'|`|kixQWODVaa	what ever you prefer is best there are down sides to both bumper pull and goose neck trailers.

AA12260609	Onions contain a compound called n-propyl disulfide, and a few other disulfides, that act as oxidant toxins. These compounds cause damage to hemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells that is responsible for carrying oxygen. Precipitation of the hemoglobin protein produces changes in the RBC shape and reduces its flexibility - a very important feature for these cells as they must traverse the tiny capillary beds throughout the body.<br>  <br>  The clumps of altered hemoglobin are known as Heinz bodies. Once they are formed, they do not resolve, the cell is irreversibly damaged. The injured red blood cells are identified as defective by some of the body's white blood cells (macrophages) and are picked out of circulation and destroyed. Or, if enough damage has occured to the red blood cell membranes, these cells may even rupture from inflexibility as they pass through the blood stream.<br>  <br>  Occasionally, sufficient oxidant injury occurs to even change the active hemoglobin into methemoglobin, a form that cannot carry any oxygen. Luckily, this reaction can be chemically reversed, as it essentially acts to "asphyxiate" the affected animal. Heinz body formation can result in a number of signs, mostly related to the anemia caused by the red blood cell destruction and breakdown--the patient may be jaundiced, weak, lethargic, have fevers, loss of appetite, vomiting or diarrhea, and enlargement of the spleen.<br>  <br>  Methemoglobinemia, however, is more likely to result in respiratory distress, including a chocolate or mud brown colored appearance to the gums and mucus membranes. (Other materials potentially associated with this serious condition include garlic and acetaminophen products).<br>  <br>  Severe toxicity can be fatal. Treatment is essentially supportive, and may require oxygen therapy and/or blood transfusion. Again, therapy can be prolonged and definitively, costly|`|295328f4cce68774697fae67c66b7468aa	Feeding onions to a dog will result in a slow and painful death for the dog.  It poisons the dogs blood.

The class judges the horses way of going, if its on the bit, and its responsiveness to the rider, plus overall attitude. Having the skill of hunter under saddle can simply mean that you can sit on this horse and do walk, trot, and canter, or it can mean that you're looking at a really nice, responsive horse, that has a good way of going and is well trained. The best way to tell is to look at the pictures of the horse. Do you like what you see or do you think theres something lacking? Happy horse shopping!<br>  P.S. Hunter under saddle is available in just about every breed and open show for english type horses. Not just for QHs and paints people!|`|0a3f28f2338343d0326744c8fa6831e8aa	the horse has been shown in flat (walk,trot,canter,ect.) classes|`|8c0306574bbdb53cbe139893bf20b3c9aa	This is from the AQHA site but it applies to any HUS classes and breeds ie..

cSOwqXKxaa	Really?  They're one of the more common toy breeds I see running around.<br>  <br>  They're awesome dogs - pretty bomb-proof, social, like to snuggle, don't hold grudges, aren't naturally shy or wary, not overly talkative, come in 4 color patterns, and aren't so small you feel like you'll break them.  Their AKC grooming standard calls for brushing only, no clipping, stripping, or scissoring, so their grooming needs are minimal compared to, say, a poodle or maltese.

yCDVWXx6aa	This is a subject of much interest and much debate. Some say that the male oscar will develop better colors, some say the female gets larger. The best way to sex oscars is to put a group of young oscars into a tank together and allow them to grow up. Hopefully a pair will establish. Other than that, it is very hard to tell the sex of oscars.|`|tShDXmgbaa	I had a pair of oscars and the only way to sex them is when they are fully mature and ready to spawn.

Oscars are a monomorphic species, meaning there are no size, colors or any visual differences between a male and female.  You either wait to see if a pair bonds and tries to spawn, by looking for eggs, or constant fighting which would indicate a pair of males, or you need to learn how to vent them.

5TM9P8tsaa	*No not at all and it will not harm her one bit. When she is ready she will let you know.|`|YpEswTQdaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  How long does she have them for? A Phantom or Pseudo Pregnancy can last up to 15-17 days. Are you sure she actually had one? Sometimes unaltered does/females will pluck fur & act moody for a day & after that they are back to normal. That's also normal,since a Doe comes into 'heat' every 4-5 days,although she IS capable of breeding any time outside this,she will willing accept the buck/male rabbit within this time. Its possible occasionally when she is 'ready' to mate she makes the nest,or acts like she is having a Pseudo pregnancy. Its not strange,even if she really IS having many Pseudo pregnancies,but it can be harmful,since if she is producing milk,she has a higher chance of getting 'Mastitis' an infection of the mammary glands,often caused by an over flowing amount of milk,due to youngsters being weened too early or Pseudo pregnancies. If you aren't hoping to breed(Please research beforehand) then i would suggest you Spay/Neutered her,since it will stop Pseudo pregnancies & the high risk of Uterus(womb) cancer.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,xxx|`|M6cP2eJyaa	It is not going to hurt her. If it makes you feel bad you can get her fixed if you are not going to use her for breeding. I hope the information helps.
AA10511925	Cute mutts.  Can have some or all of the genetic defects of its parents.  I say this because no good breeder who values her dogs and takes the time and effort (and $$$) to be sure her dogs are genetically sound will intentionally create a mutt.  Don't fall for any of that "designer dog" crap, or how a "great breeder had an accidental litter" because a good breeder dedicates her time to 1 breed and wouldn't dare let her prized dog have an "accidental" litter.  If you really want a cute mutt, adopt from your local shelter.<br>  BTW, I have nothing against pure breds or mixes, I have both.  I just hate how people pay so much $$ for a mutt.|`|2821e642f26e1d2d0daab24df234f001aa	what do you want to know?<br>  <br>  They're nice dogs, but I would rather have either a pure Yorkie or a pure Shih-tzu|`|faad72cda0dc953abfa25a27afce92e6aa	My aunt bred her yorkie and shitzu twice and both times the puppies were fine.  Now I'm not going to argue with a vet tech, but any time you breed a dog, whether to get a purebred or mutt, you rund the risk of getting a throw back that has all the problems of the breed.  When she bred her dogs they had the docile nature of the shitzu and was just a bit bigger than a yorkie and the owners love them.

Humans and animals don't just die, because they are old.  Old age brings on sicknesses.  If he is pretty old one of the possibilities might be congestive heart failure.  This is characterized by fluid around the heart that can eventually fill the lungs and lead to suffocation or fluid overload.  The vet might give him a diuretic and prolong his life a little longer.  The best thing is to just go to a professional, because it sounds like there is definitely something wrong, but it could be cured or treated easily.|`|d0c99591c0e2a4e0f9f35153a33f3a9daa	Off to the vet, old pets need vet checks about every three months.|`|a94851c62a864ef40a8deea0791ce33daa	The same thing happened to one of my pets.  She just stopped eating and got so thin.  We had to put her to sleep, because there was no help for it.  We didn't want her to suffer starvation, that would have been cruel.  I would suggest bringing him to the vet to eliminate any possibilities.  Then do what is best for your dog.  Hopefully the vet can give him something that will cure him, but if not you need to consider whether or not he is suffering or not and then do the humane thing.  I really hope it is not terminal.|`|5a8181898d43ef1985805f728512971faa	man , take it from me. i was housesitting for my girl and one of her dogs died. he wasnt eating either but he was drinking. and he would just lay in the same spot all day. he was really old tho.. im not trying to scare you but take him to a vet. theyll know what to do.

You need to have little or no corn.  Beneful and Purina are crap.  Avoid colors.<br>  I feed a mixture of Eukanuba...my handler feeds it and the one male has always done best on it.....and Innova.  The stright Innova causes a bit of diarrhea and QUICK weight gain!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  So I feed 3/4 Eukanuba Large Breed and 1/4 Innova .<br>  The best dog food for a certain dog is whatever they do well on.  That may not always be the "best" food on the market!!!!  Also, the needs of Giant breeds need to be taken into account.  If you feed a food made for the average dog, the fat,protein,calcium, amd phosphorus levels may not be the best for a Giant breed and then you are asking for bone and joint problems.<br>  <br>  Be aware of the RAW diets!!!!  ANd some of the super high quality diets!!!  They are often NOT designed for giant breeds.  The calcium level in most raw diets is WAY too high!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Consult a vet before feeding a raw diet.  Some conditions are not compatiable with a raw diet.|`|e33f997b8cd8eaa9125a385f9e6fa72baa	None of them, buy "Chicken Soup" brand dog foods.

a2325d5e9c56b1fe159d1569f8dad4acaa	Try gently touching his paws and then feeding him his favorite treat. Do this a couple of times a day and soon he'll associate you messing with his paws as a good thing. Just slowly work your way up to clipping his nails after he's used to them being handled. Say do 1 nail per day till they're all done. It may take a while, but this should work. Most dogs will do anything for food.|`|2821e642f26e1d2d0daab24df234f001aa	try and play with his paws more when you're holding him.  Try putting your fingers between his pads and get him used to having his feet touched before you try and trim his nails.|`|e4473e745c8b319aeb7214e2c3f78512aa	you need to start slowly.  and most importantly, stop over powering him and grabbing his feet.  <br>  <br>  start by distracting him with a treat, and at the moment he is eating his treat touch a foot.  <br>  <br>  do this as many times as you can.  work up to touching his feet longer.<br>  <br>  when he is no longer reacting negativly to you touching his feet, start touch his feet with the clipper.  (do not attempt to cut them.)<br>  <br>  eventually work your way up to cutting his nails.  reward him for being relaxed and letting you touch his feet.|`|783a8e4bcc7cfa46074ead476e24dee1aa	My dog is the same way he will always jerk is paws away whenever I touch them, I have no idea why, but if I ever have to do anything to his paws I just have to grab his paws and hold them tightly or else he'll try to pull them away.  I know it sounds mean but theres no other way to do it, I always give him a treat after wards in a sort of appology and in hope he will get over his paw problem lol|`|9ac084f3d0160138ddeb8780da3f9060aa	I also think that you need to gradually get him used to handling his feet.  Also, dogs generally see one person in the household as the "alpha dog" and the other members as just members of the pack.  The "alpha dog" person may have an easier time handling the dogs paws than someone else.  I only say that because we have a Doberman cross who will not let anyone but me touch her feet.<br>  <br>  If it is an emergency and you HAVE to touch his feet and all he does is jerk them away, I would just let him deal with it.  If he will bite you when you do it then I recommend wrapping him in a towel so that you can check it out. <br>  <br>  If he is licking that much I would guess that it is bothering him, poor little guy!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ac5adb706eb2dc76cbb62acea6404794aa	Muzzle him.  I groom professionally and I reccomend you take him to a groomer.  They will bathe him, express his anal glands and trim his nails all for around 20 bucks.  This is well worth it in case you clip nails too short they have styptic to dull pain and stop bleeding and muzzles and doggie cologne.  Also, he won't associate this "torture session" with you or your husband.

During this period (proestrus), females will not allow the males to breed with them although the males will be very persistent.The second part or estrus is the time in which the female will allow the male to breed her and this can last anywhere from 4-21 days. A female, most of the time, will allow most any male to breed during this time. As the female starts to go out of heat or enter diestrus, she will be less willing to breed.<br>  humping is not always a sign of wanting/needing to breed. it is also a sign of dominance...she may be trying to dominate your male dog. if you do not want to have puppies(which i hope you dont w/two dogs of different breeds) then i would recomend taking one or both to the vet and getting them fixed asap.|`|4f99f58bd330c0d49cebbd9c4cce495faa	6 months is when they generally go into heat.

If you do not intend to breed, get her fixed asap to avoid uterine infection called pyometra....|`|b889847ef08efde47069bad7eb4225f7aa	2 points

Dogs have their ears specifically shaped for their breed. It is fundamental that a dog hears properly, and cropping a dog's ears is a gross mutilation. Generally it is used when you fight dogs.

I mean look at all the dogs who homeless and who become homeless each year.  There are enough dogs on the planet for everyone in shelters.  So what if they are not pure bred.

Wow, so do I!  In fact, I have over a dozen!  Do you show your dog?  Weight pull?  Back pack?  Sled?  Go to nursing homes or schools?  I do all of the above.<br>  <br>  Where can you register as a breeder?  The only place I know if is with the USDA.  You can register as a farmer, like someone with pigs or cows, who breeds for profit, intending for your livestock to go for consumption.  The persons who are 'registered' breeders with the USDA are puppy millers.  Personally I would HATE to be labeled as a 'registered breeder'.<br>  <br>  Playing with the idea of being a breeder and becoming a responsible breeder are worlds apart.  Breeding as a business and being a responsible breeder are worlds apart.<br>  <br>  Playing with the idea means you have a dog and think, "Hey, I paid XXX dollars for this dog, I can get XXX dollars for each pup.  As dogs have 6 pups a litter, I can get XXXX dollars for a litter!  COOL!"<br>  <br>  Wrong thinking.  If you attained your healthy dog from a responsible breeder, said breeder spent XXXX dollars simply producing the litter.  S/he spend XXX dollars on medical testing, making sure the dam was as genetically sound as could be.  S/he spent XXX on stud fees from another male whose owner also spent XXX dollars making sure HE was genetically free of diseases.  The owners of sire and dam each spent XXXX dollars showing the dog to its championship, and, hopefully, spent XXX dollars on field trials for whatever working titles the dog attained.<br>  <br>  The breeders also spent a lot of time studying the pedigrees of both dogs, assuring themselves that the pups produced would be the best dogs they could possibly produce.<br>  <br>  Also, the owner of the female had her dog to the vet before becoming pregnant and for multiple visits during the pregnancy.  After whelping, there comes the after-birth vet visit and puppy check.  Then add on the extra costs of food for the pregnant female and the newly mama dog.  Puppy formula to teach the pups to eat on their own, puppy chow, innoculations and worming for the pups.  Time off from work to aide in whelping.<br>  <br>  On average, a RESPONSIBLE breeder who keeps one or two pups from the litter will profit about $20 a litter.  If that.  <br>  <br>  Backyard breeders, though, might make a real profit.  But look down the road...the pups they produce are listed on Petfinder.com, are euthanized in animal shelters, develop hip displasia, etc.,  or temperament problems and are euthanized.<br>  <br>  Heartless people might find the money they might make worth the suffering of the offspring of their dogs.  Personally, I think there is a special place reserved in Hell for such people.

There could be a number of reasons why your dog would be "wetting her bed" at night.  It could be something as simple as a bladder infection or it could be caused by spay incontinence which can happen in a spayed female at any age.  I would suggest taking her to the vet and make sure there isn't anything physically wrong with her first. <br>  <br>  My dog developed spay incontinence at 6 yrs old, I opted to keep her off of meds to help because the only med the vet wanted to put her on was some kind of hormones or something and it could damage other organs over time and since she was only 6 I didn't want to risk that.  What I have done with her that seems to help is I feed her a diet completely free of grains, I take her out about 20 min after she drinks water, and she sleeps on pee pads when she naps just in case; but so far she very rarely has any pee accidents anymore when she sleeps and it's been 4 yrs now since she was originally diagnosed.|`|223e17693891cb5657ebf6113cf491f9aa	That does not sound normal.

They should be brushed daily with extra attention to the uniquely textured undercoat to prevent matting. Hairless Chinese Crested Dogs’ skin requires regular care: prevent sunburn by applying sunscreen when outdoors, massage with a moisturizer to keep skin supple, and bathe often to prevent blemishes. This breed sheds very little and is a good choice for those who suffer from allergies. The Chinese Crested is an extremely clean dog and is usually not prone to body odor, ticks, or fleas. They are good apartment dwellers and love to play games. They are very active indoors and require minimal exercise. The Hairless Chinese Crested is sensitive to the cold and should wear some sort of covering when taken outside in the winter months. The Chinese Crested Dog is susceptible to progressive retinal atrophy, lens luxation and glaucoma; the dog may also suffer from deafness, patellar luxation and seizures.|`|440c40c260dd059fd2411f1abb564c12aa	You need to visit the clubs dude ..they must hang out somewhere,,normally they are hard..and to handle one  when you get hold of it ..is not easy|`|1a77a10e30f34212b11379ba7a0ff022aa	I think the breed of dog you are talking about is completly bald.

Sometimes by confining them to a small room until they settle in is less stressful since a new territory can feel quite overwhelming.  The smaller space helps them gain some sense of  control.  It's important to note that although it isn't pleasant to find gifts anywhere try not to reprimand the cat in any way as this causes more distress and may contribute to the problem which makes it more frustrating for you to manage.  <br>  <br>  He may have been surrendered for this very reason or perhaps an innocent one such as the owner passed away or they can no longer financially care for the cat, or it was abandoned, etc.  <br>  <br>  It certainly would hurt to contact the rescue and ask if they have any information on your cat's history/previous owner. <br>  <br>  As a general rule when cats inappropriately soil there are several possibilties to consider:<br>   changes with litter brands<br>  - location of the litter box isn't private enough<br>  - some cats like to have one box to defecate and another to urinate<br>  - cleanliness (some cats are very finicky and prefer a super clean box)<br>  - as a general rule there should be one litter box for each cat plus one extra as a back up <br>  <br>  If all these have been ruled out, there's a chance that your cat may have developed another underlying medical problem which can contribute to accidents outside of the box. Cats will associate pain while using box and change their habits as a result.  Rescue/shelter cats are more prone to stress and with any dramatic change in their life such as moving to a new home this can be quite traumatic.<br>  <br>  Here's an article about why cats inappropriately soil outside their litter box by Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine: <a href="http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/brochures/Housesoiling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/brochures...</a><br>  <br>  House soiling is the most common behavior problem reported by cat owners. It includes urination and/or defecation outside the litter box, as well as urine spraying.<br>  <br>  Why do cats eliminate outside of the litter box? <br>  One common misconception is that cats soil in inappropriate places for revenge. It is tempting to conclude, "He defecated on the living room carpet to punish me for leaving him for the weekend." But this kind of calculation requires sophisticated cognitive abilities that cats aren't believed to possess. Furthermore, this conclusion assumes that cats view their urine and feces as distasteful, when in fact they do not. It is only we humans who view it that way.<br>  <br>  Medical Problems<br>  So why do cats urinate or defecate on your bed or carpet? Medical problems are one possibility. Inflammation of the urinary tract may cause painful or frequent urination, inability to urinate, bloody urine, and crying during urination. An affected cat is likely to eliminate outside the litter box if he comes to associate the box with painful urination, or if he has an increased urgency to urinate. In addition, kidney, liver, and thyroid diseases often lead to increased drinking and urination. Inflammation of the colon or rectum, intestinal tract tumors, intestinal parasites, and other gastrointestinal conditions may cause painful defecation, increased frequency or urgency to defecate, and decreased control of defecation. Age-related diseases that interfere with a cat's mobility (for example, arthritis, nervous system disorders, or muscular diseases), or with his cognitive functions can also influence his ability to get to the litter box in time. In short, any medical condition that interferes with a cat's normal elimination behavior can lead to house soiling.<br>  <br>  Litter Box Aversions<br>  Behavioral problems, such as litter box aversions, inappropriate site preferences, or urine spraying can also lead to house soiling. An aversion implies that there is something about the litter box that your cat finds unsavory. It could be the box, the litter, the location of the box, or all three.<br>  <br>  ...please consider visiting the website for further details

Here are some helpful tips. One you need to assert your dominence over them. I find that talking to an animal the way you would a 3 year old that is in trouble usually works. If you don't want them barking tell them in a firm voice to stop barking when they start doing so. If they stop give them a treat. If they don't, repeat what you said until they do and give them a treat. Same with the jumping. Who ever is getting jumped on needs to firmly push the dog down into a sitting position and say No stop. I don't like that. It sounds crazy but my dog listens to me that way and every dog I've been around I did the same thing with. And they all listened better when I said it firmly but didn't yell. They can tell if you are master or not without you even speaking. Your dog should not be afraid of you but should listen and know that you are the leader. As for the pup issue, all dogs go through stress same as us. The reason you have to retrain them is to let them know that just because something changed does not mean that you are no longer master. Dogs are very territorial towards others and them going to the bathroom in the house is them marking their area and telling the newcomer that they were there first. They will get use to him eventually. I have my dog on the 3 count that you use for kids and she does very well with it. I tell her to do something. If she doesn't I say 1 and repeat what I wanted her to do. If she still doesn't I say 2, and repeat adding you know what happens when I get to 3 (in your case you will want to decide what you will do. I give my dog a light smack on the bottom to let her know that I'm serious. Don't hurt your dog. Just let them know that you are leader. Leader's of a pack deal out punishment as well.) If I get to 3 which I never have to with my dog anymore and she still won't do as told I will "dole out the punishment" for not obeying and usually they understand after that. You can put them on the 3 count for just about any command. It is best to start when they are pups but older dogs can learn to. If none of this helps you you can also go to your nearest Petsmart and ask the dog trainer they have. They will probably have more advice for you. And you can contact me through my profile if this helps and you want additional advice.
883ceb217ec4bfe374c4f894b4cf164faa	Try grooming her when she's sleepy. Puppies always have spaz attacks at the most inconveient times, it's true. Your other dogs were probably not as active and playful as she is. They're all different with different personalities.<br>  <br>  When she's had her supper meal and gone to the bathroom and has FINALLY settled down in the early evening, wait until she's rather sedate and quiet. Don't make a big fuss over her - just reach for the brush and begin gently stroking her with it. If she gets up and gets spazzy, stop brushing and wait for calm again. Next time, brush more lightly and slowly so it doesn't get her charged up. Over a week's time you should be able to brush her when she's calm.<br>  <br>  Over time, try lifting a paw and brushing it. Then the tail. Stop brushing when she gets spazzy. There's no sense wrestling with her - she's too young to handle restraint. The wiggly ones take a bit longer to learn how to settle during grooming but she'll get it eventually. Slow and steady wins the race.|`|YZzDlyaZaa	Well you could do it yourself having not a clue about anything or check out this website where you will learn everything but you do have to pay a bit but I tell you it's worth it and you'll save heaps.<br>  www.homedoggrooming.com|`|c9c76297191ac14d97bee289977e7fa7aa	You can buy some lavender (the real stuff, not just fragrance).

If you do, you'll be sedating her for the rest of her life.  Shih tzu puppies are generally hyper for grooming.  Just take it slow, do it in small phases, and remember that she's a baby.  Make sure you choose a time she's naturally sleepy, not too close to feeding time or play times.  Talk softly, show her the brush, and firmly correct her if she bites or anything- just gently tap her neck or push her away and say 'no bite', and start again.  Don't yell or hit, and don't try to pin her down and brush her, that will only make it worse.  As soon as you can get in a few strokes without any fuss, praise her calmly but sweetly (you don't want to get her jumping around and ruin your progress), give her a treat, and stop for the night.  Keep working with her until the good brush time gets longer and longer.  And don't forget to get her in to see a professional soon!  She needs to get used to clipping too, unless you plan to keep her in a full coat by yourself.|`|43df204b5db550d17f5cfe2074ffe36faa	Excellent advice so far.  <br>  <br>  Another thing you  could try is experimenting with different tones of voice.  I've noticed with my pooch that if a command isn't given in a particular tone - he won't take the slightest notice. Change the pitch and volume .....ALACAZAM !<br>  <br>  Also, you could groom the older dogs before you groom pup. They learn an awful lot from their elders and like to fit in with the pack, so if you groom the older dogs first (and they behave) she/he should hopefully follow suit.

Most of the time it's either the grain or the protein source (meat) that is the cause of most skin allergies.

When I switched I noticed a definite improvement in my dogs' coat and skin. I tried three different top-quality brands. All of them made an improvement in their coats.<br>  <br>  There's more than two brands of good dog food. If I were you, I'd explore the good brands and choose one based on 1. what you can afford, 2. what's available in your area and 3. what your dog likes/how it helps his coat.<br>  <br>  I trust the Whole Dog Journal's annual report on dog foods. It is not available for free online, but this is due to the fact that WDJ doesn't take ads and so is unbiased. You can buy their report on dog foods, though. <a href="http://www.whole-dog-journal.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whole-dog-journal.com/</a><br>  <br>  Also, this is a pretty good site for finding good foods: <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a><br>  <br>  If you were feeding kibble I'd suggest going through a large bag before deciding to keep feeding it or try another one.

Das wirkt auf den ersten und zweiten Blick sehr kompliziert. Auf den dritten Blick kapiert man es langsam. Will man Risiken vermeiden, kommt man leider nicht drum herum: Im Fleisch, das wir beim Metzger oder im Supermarkt kaufen ist n?mlich leider nicht alles, was unsere Katzen zum Leben brauchen. Die meisten industriellen Dosenfutter enthalten solche Zus?tze. Daher ist eine Supplementierung auch erst bei einer Rohfuttermenge n?tig, die mehr als 20 % der Ern?hrung des Tieres ausmacht.<br>  <br>  Für diejenigen, die sich ernsthaft mit dem Gedanken tragen, mehr als 20 % roh zu füttern (und demnach Infos zum  supplementieren etc. brauchen), ist es empfehlenswert, sich bei der yahoo-Group katzen-alternativ anzumelden.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://de.groups.yahoo.com/group/katzen-alternativ">http://de.groups.yahoo.com/group/katzen-...</a>|`|48edcbaf7757817fb2d0a6001cb9a996aa	Eine Katze ist und bleibt ein Raubtier.

Wenn sie nicht eine Zimmerkatze ist, die nie drau?en war und nie rauskommt, dann wird sie auch nach V?geln und M?usen jagen. Diesen Instinkt kann ihr niemand austreiben. Sie wird auch an dieser Beute knabbern. Fressen aber nicht unbedingt. Es gibt Katzen, die ihre "Beute" dem Frauchen pr?sentieren wollen und sie vor die Tür legen. W?re sie nicht satt, dann würde sie die Beute auch fressen. Aber wenn sie drinnen genug zu fressen bekommt kann es sein, dass sie sie nicht frisst, sondern pr?sentiert. <br>  <br>  In einem Tierfilm wurde mal gezeigt, dass eine junge Katze sich zuerst an den "Gestank" von M?usen gew?hnen muss. Mit der Jagdroutine kommt dann auch der "Geschmack". Das mag auch erkl?ren warum Katzen zwar die Maus jagen, aber sie nur pr?sentieren. Sie haben sich wohl zu sehr an das Fresschen von Frauchen gew?hnt. Aber Jagen, das geben sie nicht auf. Was tun sie, wenn man mit einem Faden rumspielt? Sie jagen ihm nach. Besonders einem Wollkneuel. Der Raubtierinstikt bleibt! <br>  <br>  Mit rohem Fleisch füttern würde den also nicht "anerziehen", sondern h?chstens den Geschmack auf rohem Fleisch antrainieren.

eb7ec734ce2eec6f98b9f9b671f2faa3aa	HI DU!<br>  <br>  Beim Katzenschnupfen handelt es sich um eine Infektionskrankheit der Katze (Feline Virale Rhinotracheitis), die durch verschiedene Viren wie Calici-Viren, Herpes-Viren, sowie verschiedene Bakterien wie Mykoplasmen (auch Mollicutes oder Pleuropneumonia Like Organisms, PPLO genannt) und Chlamydien ausgel?st und übertragen wird.<br>  <br>  Katzenschnupfen ist ansteckend, der Kontakt einer infizierten Katze mit anderen, gesunden Katzen sollte deshalb unbedingt vermieden werden, da die Krankheitserreger des Katzenschnupfens durch Tr?pfchen von Nasensekret, Tr?nenflüssigkeit und Speichel übertragen werden und zur Ansteckung führen k?nnen. Auch kontaminierte Gegenst?nde (N?pfe u.?.) k?nnen die Katzenschnupfen-Erreger auf gesunde Tiere übertragen und zur Infektion führen.<br>  <br>  Die Inkubationszeit betr?gt nur wenige Tage, d.h. der Katzenschnupfen kann bereits innerhalb von 1 bis 5 Tagen ausbrechen. Symptome des Katzenschnupfens sind meist hohes Fiber (erkennbar durch heisse Ohren und Nase) und h?ufiges Niesen. ünhlich der Erk?ltung und dem Schnupfen beim Menschen, schwellen die Mandeln und Lymphknoten im Halsbereich an und die Katze hat auffallend tr?ndende Augen und eine tropfende Schnupfen-Nase. Mit dem Katzenschnupfen infizierte Katzen sind zudem matt, motivationslos und haben keinen Appetit. Mit fortschreitender Krankheit kann es zu vermehrtem Haarausfall und Entzündungen der Mundschleimhaut sowie der Augen kommen. In einzelnen, schweren F?llen k?nnen Lungenentzündungen und Geschwüre eine Folge des Katzenschnupfens sein.<br>  <br>  Durch Impfung (eine Standardimpfung für Katzen beim Tierarzt) kann der Ansteckung und Erkrankung erfolgreich vorgebeugt werden. Bei bereits ausgebrochener Krankheit sollte unbedingt und schnellstm?glich der Tierarzt aufgesucht werden. Zur Behandlung des Katzenschnupfens sollte man zun?chst die Voraussetzungen dafür zu schaffen, da? die Katze durch ihre eigenen Abwehrkr?fte die Krankheitserreger bek?mpfen kann. Dazu ist es notwendig, die Lebens- und Umweltbedingungen der erkrankten Katzen so zu ver?ndern, da? ein nicht zu trockenes, warmes Raumklima das überleben und Vermehren der Erreger (Viren und Bakterien) verhindert. Neben der Behandlung mit Antibiotika sollte besonders auf Reingigung und Pflege von Augen und Nase der Katze geachtet werden. Das Hauptziel der Behandlung ist die St?rkung des Immunsystems und der Abwehrkr?fte der Katze.|`|7eb9c81c41aad10e911b8ffbc2e7bdd8aa	Sorry, aber von 'Ferndiagnosen' halte ich überhaupt nichts, da jeder Fall anders ist! Deshalb: Hol dir unbedingt noch eine zus?tzliche 2. Meinung von einem anderen Tierarzt. Kommt er zum selben Ergebnis, dann weisst du wenigstens, dass du alle M?glichkeiten ausgesch?pft hast. Lieber nur ein Auge, als st?ndig Schmerzen.<br>  <br>  So schlimm wie es ist ein Auge zu verlieren, aber Katzen kommen durch ihre hervorragend ausgepr?gten anderen Sinne mit so einer Behinderungen prima klar!

Ich lasse dies allerdings nicht mehr machen, denn mir hat mal ein Tierarzt gesagt, dass der Zahnstein nach der Entfernung nur schneller wiederkommt und da ich das bei unserer Perserkatze auch so beobachtet habe, lasse ich Zahnstein jetzt da wo er ist - au?er natürlich das Zahnfleisch entzündet sich.|`|Y0aEPjH9aa	das kommt darauf an wir sind bei einem Tierarzt wo es nur 25€ kostet normal kann das bis 50€ gehen|`|dZ4D8cJhaa	Kostet bei uns zwischen 30-40 Euro.

883ceb217ec4bfe374c4f894b4cf164faa	If you get a new puppy now your original puppy is likely to bond to it's doggie partner and not to you.

I have 2 Bostons myself (male 2 yrs, female 8 months) and i didn't notice and territorial issuses from my male when we brought the female home. if you bring a new puppy in to your house too soon after getting the first, the dogs will bond to eachother stronger that with you and your son. also, having 2 puppies in the house can be really time consuming, especially if they are Bostons, lol. research a few good breeders and talk to them about what they think about a second dog, then get yourself on a waiting list for a puppy. good luck, and i know once the time is right, you will love having 2 Bostons in the house, but i must warn you, they do get addictive, lol, i already want a 3rd :)

(evita la Purina e tutti i croccantini tipo Friskies, Kit e Kat, Sheba, ecc).<br>  Se fa lo schizzinoso e non vuole mangiare, non dargli altre cose... si arrenderà da sè!|`|VbykdLXsaa	Io ho notato che dando sempre cibo della stessa marca alla mia gatta, si era assuefatta e non accettava altro.

Il cibo secco di marca che compri in negozi specializzati (e che costa ben di più) non dovrebbe dare problemi (io però alterno le marche lo stesso, per sicurezza).|`|ztTzOx3eaa	I croccantini fanno bene al gatto, sia ai denti che ai reni. il gatto mangiandoli prova sete,beve tanto e fa tanta pipì. non li eliminerei dalla dieta. Tuttavia se puoi dagli anche qualcos'altro da mangiare, così si abitua a non avere solo la sua droga di croccantini quotidiana. Potresti fare un 50 per cento di umido e uno di secco.<br>  Ti suggerirei inoltre di mettere i croccantini in un contenitore di plastica ben chiuso e al riparo dalle sue zampine furbette.|`|MkAZVlx5aa	I croccantini, al contrario di quanto si pensa comunemente, sono un tipo di alimento che da solo non può costituire una dieta completa. Oltretutto, nei gatti maschi castrati una dieta a base di croccantini può, a lungo andare, favorire problemi ai reni e formazione di calcoli. Il mio consiglio è di stabilire, anche con l'aiuto del veterinario o del negozio per animali, una quantità giusta giornaliera, che darai al gatto in 2 pasti. Diminuisci la razione gradualmente, così non se ne accorge; cambia posto ai croccantini, così smettera di associare il posto al fatto che avrà cibo.|`|PUQ3DHqfaa	Il gatto di mia nonna aveva lo stesso problema, non voleva altro, abbiamo eliminato i croccantini e alla fine è tornato a mangiare come un gatto normale.|`|ZdZrGKvBaa	cambia prodotto!prova i pezzetti di carne...|`|uCqfXTYvaa	intanto cambia contenitore! il gatto è malandrino, forse anche i croccantini sn pieni di schifezze. prova a cambiare marca e lasciaglieli finche non si abitua a quelli nuovi|`|868bf3a36dd9e87fe61d493760f32df5aa	intanto nn comprare queelli di supermercato..<br>  fanno malissimo lal micio...contengono coloranti ,appetizzanti,  e le peggiori schifezze che a lungo andare distruggono i reni ai mici..<br>  <br>  compre  marche superpremium royal canin yills..<br>  a lungom andare risparmi anche se costano di piu'..<br>  li risparmi di veterinario..<br>  io i croccantini li tengo nel sacchetto originale..<br>  si conservano meglio  senza luce e aria|`|d1a883971996622015a44b23a825537aaa	nascondili meglio in modo che non veda il vasetto magari dentro un mobile.|`|70d531f48f4dd3a9928c0b05b0d7ae71aa	oh mio dio...;) cambia cibo....kiss ;)|`|V2sBP41oaa	Controlla che fra gli ingredienti non ci sia la taurina....quella dà dipendenza...|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	Hai ragione: probabilmente c'è dentro ''erba gatta'' o qualcosa di simile che è una droga per i gatti.

2821e642f26e1d2d0daab24df234f001aa	Shih-tzus can be a little stubborn and some can be difficult to potty train, it just depends on the dog.  <br>  <br>  Take her out often like every hour or so at first, 10 min after eating or drinking, right when she wakes up, and after she's been playing.  When you can't keep 100% watch on her put her in a safe area like a fenced off kitchen where she can't make a mess on the carpet.  When you do have her out running around in the house limit her access to just one room and keep constant watch on her, if she looks like she is about to pee or is circling to poo tell her no and then pick her up and take her outside.  Once she does what she is supposed to do outside give her LOTS of praise.  I also give my pups a potty command when I take them out, for my dogs I use "hurry up".  <br>  <br>  Never hit or rub a puppy's nose in their mess.  If they make a mess in the house it was because you weren't keeping a close enough watch on her.  If this happens just take her outside and then clean up her mess without her being able to see you clean it (I've heard that it's best if they don't see you clean up after them).<br>  <br>  My little female Shih-tzu was totally potty trained by 4 mo. and my little boy tzu wasn't totally trained until he was 6 mo.  <br>  By totally trained I mean that they no longer had any accidents in the house when left at home while we went out or went to work.  (I only work part time, so they were only left alone for 5 or 6 hours at a time).|`|15395e79512f002ed24180ccf89bd534aa	kinda good needed some help so my dad helped but do not get pads for your dogs|`|AA10787156	I haven't raised any shih tzus from pups but we've had several rescues who were kind of spotty with their housebreaking.  What seemed to do the trick was keeping them on a leash attached to a belt or belt loop so they were right with us all the time, and then as soon as they showed any signs of having to go, RUSHING them outside so they could do it there and then giving lots of praise.  We did treats at first but weened them off the treats pretty quickly.  They seemed to get the hang of it very quickly and when they had to be at home for several hours, we used puppy pads and they quickly learned to use those but soon didn't need them.<br>  <br>  However, these were 1-4 year old dogs who may have had some housebreaking and were messed up by mistreatment or neglect, so it might not be exactly the same.  Also, full grown dogs are able to "hold it" better and don't need to go out as frequently.|`|eEnTW2ihaa	Hi There I have a new shih tzu puppy also.  I have housebroken a shih tzu before and will tell you they are very stubborn.  The easiest way is the crate or a very small space to keep them in.  They will not mess up their eating and sleeping area.  Feed on a schedule and then take them outside approximately 20 min. later. Do not bring them in until they have been successful, they will come straight back in the house and mess inside.  Once you have them trained they are wonderful and good for absolutely nothing but love.  They want to please you and respond to alot of good girl and love.

They may look cute and cuddly, but they are social animals and they easily become depressed and violent in captivity.  Primate sanctuaries across the U.S. are full of neglected, mentally ill, former pet monkeys who their owners gave up after they realized that monkeys are simply not fit for pets.  Even the sweetest, most friendly monkey can snap and cause serious injury to its owner.  If you don't believe me or the other answerers, do a google search of pet monkey and see what the results tell you.|`|FEqix8Lzaa	Monkey's are wild animals, and by the sound of it, your not looking for a pet, your looking for a profit.

Stay away from bullies that are ridiculously cheap, they are either scams or the are dogs that are going to have some serious health problems. Bullies are notorious for having health problems anyway, and poor breeding makes it worse. <br>  <br>  I purchased a Bullie from a lady a long time ago for $900, and by the time that I had him treated for all of his internal and external parasites (he had Giardia and Demodectic mange) I spent $2000 on just treating his health problems, then he had to have another $1500 worth of surgery to correct some of the breed problems (he had an elongated soft pallatte and stenotic nares).

The prices vary according to the rescue, but they won't cost as much as a puppy.

The INKC is just a group of people that create this 'registry' for mixed breeds and designer breed dogs (MUTTS!) to make it look like unsuspecting dog buyers/owners were getting a 'registered', therefore 'purebred' dog This is NOT the case. Unfortunately, many dogs are cross bred, inbred and basically genetically changed to suit the wants of owners ('hypoallergenic' labradoodles) for one, when in fact it takes about 8 generations for this mix to actually be a suitable pet for an allergic person (and only then if they can get the temperament right...) There are a few other registries out there, all of which are nothing but profit seekers, related to puppy mills and the larger petstores.<br>  I hope this helps some... good luck with your puppy :-)|`|c56769faa6a17951afc2da21c4ffceeeaa	Never heard of INKC registered, the ONLY registries I am aware of (in North America) are the American Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club.|`|qFnnbxbHaa	Indian National Kennel Club, somewhat of a joke of a registry.

wkRYqJWOaa	If the ear isnt red or smelly, it probably just a little dirty-also a little shaking is ok, but if the dog is scratching alot- back to the vet. Because of their floppy ears, not much fresh air gets into a labs ears. But vets are always to quick to treat symptoms and not causes. I had a german shepherd who had chronic infections in his ears, all the vets did was give me drops and cleaners-eventually these stopped working and he was in constant pain-then they wanted to give him cortisone steroids-still not actually dealing with the cause. Finally I tried him on a raw/natural diet-problem fixed. Diet can be a big cause, or allergies. Use your descretion-if the dog starts to scratch, and the gunk comes back-probably an ear infection, but find out WHY this happens, or else it will just come back. GOOD LUCK:)|`|43813fc7593433c2d72131dbffc52653aa	I have a chocolate lab who has just gotten over her ear infection and I had to clean her ear once per week with vinegar water.  After her medication was done, I knew she was cured because she stopped shaking her head constantly.<br>  <br>  Perhaps just watch for the symptoms to reappear, like shaking her head, scratching, or seeming discontent.  Labs are known for waxy ears.  I didn't know this til my vet told me.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA11089866	Sounds fine to me. She'll start scratching and shaking her head if something's bothering her. You'll also see a lot of darker pink or red.<br>  <br>  What a lucky dog to have such a caring owner!|`|aLtI9z9Baa	The thing you refer to is an otoscope in case you would like to know. Her ears may not be infected. Sometimes allergies will cause inflammed ears. Sometimes fleas and ticks can bother them too. If her ears smell like a dirty gym sock, they are likely infected with yeast. When in doubt, call your vet|`|0xJZJggVaa	Maybe. I have Bloodhounds and clean mine daily. Keep up with them now.  Perhaps once a week. If your lab swims, you really have to do it a lot more often. Check with your vet if it comes back.|`|AA10182638	If you're really worried, have your vet check her out for infection, but she sounds like she's alright to me.  As long as she's not shaking her head or scratching at her ears a lot, and as long as you are regularly cleaning her ears (once a week, MINIMUM), you don't have too much to worry about.  If you find that her ears are still getting fairly dirty even with your weekly cleaning, try increasing the frequency, or switching to a different cleanser.  Water and Vinegar work wonders for most dogs, but as with any med or treatment, some just don't respond as well.  Good luck!
70fe0d11f109810cc1831028b4e46976aa	Our 8 year old Rottie and 6 year old cat used to get along fine. Once we had to put the Rottie down, we got another puppy. The puppy, Daisy, views the cat, Princess, as another puppy -- or at least another dog. She doesn't understand why the cat doesn't want to play like the other dogs at the dog park. With no claws on her front feet, Princess bats her on the nose. Daisy says, "Oh, you want to play paw games? Ok, I can do that. That's fun." Then the dog paws at the cat, the cat freaks and runs, and the dog chases her thinking it's a cool game. It's hard because the dog isn't being intentionally mean. She only wants to play with the cat. However, the dog's growing large size (she's a collie) and the cat's small size are never going to be equal. We try to give each a reward when they're calm, laying around near each other, and say the word "Gentle" a whole lot. I've heard a spray water bottle would work too and some people use them. Just make sure to spray the dog and not the cat. It's just going to take time, your puppy is going to get scratched (ours got bitten a whole lot of times), and ultimately the puppy will grow and mellow out. It's a lot easier to socialize them when they're both young, but life is never perfect. What we did when we first got the kitten, and Jewel the Rottie was only 2 years old, was put up a barrier to a bedroom. Princess was in the bedroom, and both she and Jewel could look at each other and sniff noses without actually confronting each other. It was only like 3 days before we could remove the barrier and they got along fine after that.|`|1958b4e7b7296a984ff7f5718ee0b6d1aa	just because the dog is the same breed doesn't mean it is the same dog. your cats may not like the young personality desturbing their naps and wanting to play. it is a disruptance in the cats life being forced to be with someone they aren't used to. you may give it time and see if they get used to eachother. or you may be in a situation where I was a few years back where you need to keep them seperated. I would put my cat in the basement and then when I moved I had a hallway door and left one up front and one in back. they were ok when I was around but I felt my dog was tormented during the day by the cat so I protected him best I could by keeping them in separate areas. you may want to try it if they don't like one another after awhile.

I know things can get a bit rough in the dog forums, especially when someone wants to breed mutts.<br>  <br>  If you really want to breed two or more breeds to "create a better breed", that of course would mean that you're testing all parents to see if they have any health problems and are also ensuring that they have superior temperaments as pets.<br>  <br>  If you do that, you'd be ahead of nearly all people who are purposely breeding mutts, and I'd commend you for that. You'll still get a lot of people (including myself) disagreeing with what you're doing, but one of the biggest problems people have is that these people purposely breed mutts taking no responsibility for the pup's future health or welfare.<br>  <br>  Actually, before you make a decision, why don't you go to a dog show and check out the Japanese Chin and talk to the Chin people. The thing I love about purebreds is that they have a long history. Also, it's a real challenge to breed quality dogs. That, I think, can be real fun. You can show what you've bred and compete against what other people have bred. Your goal as a responsible breeder is to create a dog that is healthy with a good temperament but also best represents the "ideal Japanese Chin." This is what's always fascinated me about breeding.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
qFnnbxbHaa	Do you have any Idea how expensive it is to be a breeder. For one thing when I buy a breeder I am paying almost twice the price you would pay for a pet. My male alone cost me $5000<br>  if he were sold as a pet he would have sold for $1500. <br>  <br>  Than there are fees to be a registered, Vet Bills are high. <br>  Most Reputable Breeders feed a high quality diet. I have 8 Cats and spend on average $600/mth on food alone. Plus allot of time and energy goes into raising the kittens, some have to be bottle fed every two hrs. <br>  <br>  Just so you know I have not made a cent in profit in three years<br>  <br>  Call around to different breeders and ask if they have any retired cats for sale. They usually sell them for a fraction of the price,|`|AA12398420	Lots of reasons why they are so high...they have alot of high vet bills and genetic diseases, etc...<br>  If you want a certain breed and not the high price tag then adopt one.

Good luck!|`|9095648c52f548eec1e40f57b09c4bc8aa	Because breeders are greedy and are making money at the expense of other cats being euthanised. <br>  Please contact your local cat rescue group or shelter and adopt one of their cats...there are some priceless gems there and you will be much happier because they will be so grateful & loving cause you saved them, and you will also know that you saved their life.  Buying a cat from a breeder, means another cat in a shelter dies.  Would that really make you feel good?<br>  IMO, breeding, except in exceptional circumstances should be outlawed.  There are more than 50 million cats being euthanised each year in the USA, and the breeders and people who buy pedigree cats significantly contribute to those numbers.<br>  Honestly, rescue cats can be exotic and incredibly loving.<br>  Perhaps you could look at it this way...if you go to the pound & buy a mixed breed, you will be getting 3 exotic breeds in one cat for less than the price of one bred cat!|`|vPxCtQHJaa	They are expensive because you cannot find that kind of feline just anywhere, they are a special breed, almost like a limited edition collectors item, which explains the price.

Am besten ist eine Mischung aus beiden denn, viele sagen zwar es sei egal aber, nur Trockenfutter w?re nicht so toll. Das Trockenfutter wird durch Wasser im Magen aufgebl?ht, deswegen muss immer Wasser neben dem Napf stehn. Ich selbst hab mal bei einem Bekannten, er hatt einen Yorksher(richtig geschr.?) und auch nur Trockenfutter gegeben. Man wenn der kleine dann a a gemacht hat, hat er sich fast verkrampft, das Zeug kam raus wie trockenes Holz... Egal was für ein Hund auch immer, jeder(!) stammt vom Wolf ab und, ist somit Fleischfresser... Ich rate dazu, Dosenfutter zu geben aber, immer einen Napf mit Trockenfutter aufzustellen. So kann der Hund selbst immer mal selber knabbern zwischendurch. <br>  übrigens hab ich die Vermutung, dass bei Katzen das Trockenfutter erfunden wurde, weil die Katzen keine M?use mehr fangen. So gibt das Trockenfutter einen Ersatz, für die Knochen die Katzen sonst ja knacken müssten...|`|eeb06a684e7980e7ef7ba4f1ddc211e1aa	Weder noch, Frisch ist das Beste.|`|1946f80c9337d8e6e3a57dd04caec43aaa	Das kann man sicher nicht so allgemein sagen.

95d93e9081cc0c8837c7c9d1d8a7bd3daa	Chihuahua.<br>  <br>  Scheduling potty can be difficult but it starts with scheduling eating.  She should be eating 3 times a day and will likely poop about 20-30 minutes after eating.  She should get out at least every 2 hours right now to potty.  What that means is that when you can't watch her, she needs to be in a kennel/crate and needs to get out about every 2 hours to do her business (or when she wakes up).  When she is out with you watching her (which she should be as frequently as you can manage), watch for potty behaviors (sniffing, circling, squatting), though the may not be present very strongly in such a young dog.  If she gives any indication that she needs to go, get her out to the potty area (yes you can skip the whole paper training step if you want, I start with litters of puppies about 5-6 weeks old learning to go outside to potty).  If you have an older dog, that helps too, because they can learn from the older dog to go out too. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your baby.|`|79b683320c15283ce2113981267d42ffaa	you are doing really good.

She will put  two and two together quickly.<br>  Crate training helps enormously, since they will try not to eliminate where they sleep.<br>  Remember though that she  really can't hold it for very long.<br>  The general guideline is they can hold it  one hour for every month old..ie. 2 hours for a 2 month old dog, 3 hours for a 3 month old and so forth.<br>  It appears you are on the right track, so just be patient and it will get better.<br>  Good luck !!
FPaJpqmNaa	Gleichgewichtsst?rungen<br>  <br>  Gleichgewichtsst?rungen sind vorwiegend Folge einer Innenohrinfektion, die sich vom ?u?eren Geh?rgang über das Trommelfell ausbreitet und das Gleichgewichtsorgan im Innenohr bef?llt, oder eines ?Schlaganfalls?, der bei ?lteren Katzen ziemlich h?ufig auftritt. Es handelt sich, genaugenommen, nicht um die gleiche Art von Schlaganf?llen, wie sie den Menschen ereilen, aber die Symptome sind ?hnlich: Durch eine pl?tzliche Unterbrechung der Blutversorgung bestimmter Hirnareale wird die Kontrollfunktion des Gleichgewichtssinns au?er Kraft gesetzt.<br>  <br>  In beiden F?llen verliert die Katze pl?tzlich ihren Gleichgewichtssinn, l?uft fortgesetzt in einer Richtung im Kreis oder verliert ihr Stehverm?gen v?llig. In leichteren F?llen, oder beim Abklingen des Syndroms, h?lt die Katze einfach den Kopf schief. Hirntumore k?nnen bei ?lteren Katzen ?hnliche Symptome hervorrufen, die allerdings meist nicht ganz so pl?tzlich, sondern allm?hlich auftreten. War eine Unterbrechung der Blutzufuhr das ausl?sende Moment, so kann sich der Zustand langsam bessern, und viele Katzen behalten zwar die Kopfschiefhaltung hei, fühlen sich aber sonst wieder ganz wohl. Im Fall eines Hirntumors ist natürlich die Prognose schlecht, wenn auch in manchen F?llen durch Medikamente noch eine durchaus lebenswerte Frist gewonnen werden kann.<br>  <br>  Wenn eine Infektion des Ohres vorliegt, ist meist eine Behandlung mit einem Antibiotikum erfolgreich. Wenn der Entzündungsherd sehr tief im Ohr ist, kann eine Operation erforderlich sein, um Eiter aus den kn?chernen Geh?rg?ngen tief im Ohrkanal spülen zu k?nnen.<br>  <br>  Bitte schnell zum Tierarzt|`|84a801655547481fbe4c88bf69eacacbaa	Meine Tiki hatte die gleichen Symptome, und sie war auch 10 Jahre alt.

If she recently had diarrhea, she likely doesn't have constipation, you're just seeing a decreased volume of stool because it's now becoming formed, and all of the water is coming out as urine.  Frequently people will think their cats are constipated when they have a urinary infection because they see the cat visit the litterbox frequently and seem to strain aot.  If you havn't already visited a vet, I'd suggest you do so.

Even if it's not parvo, if he won't eat anything his blood sugar will get too low, and if he isn't drinking he will get dehydrated quickly. Please take him to the vet. Don't wait until tomorrow, he could be very sick by then.|`|FNYEkyqLaa	Get this dog to a vet immediately.  Do not risk this dogs life by having strangers guess at a cause.|`|14d9b0e2c172096dbceb79974ea555f8aa	Parvo, parasites, or both.  Could be any number of things.  Nevertheless, he needs medical care, and he needs it fast.<br>  Go see a vet!|`|AA12306645	It sounds like he needs a vet... now.  If he is depressing and has runny stools, he is becoming dehydrated.  Death ain't far off, if you wait, hon|`|JrnXCy49aa	I wouldn 't take a chance, even though it may not be something very serious, it may br very draining not to mention dehydrating for your dog at such an age. Please take him to the vet.|`|MRquwjgPaa	i seriously think its parvovirus, take him to the vet right away, don't stall or it will end up costing up to $2000. 12 weeks is about when they are the most susceptible to parvo. i would not chance it. take it to a vet if you care for this puppy.|`|gCMLzrTAaa	sounds like parvo ....you need to get him to the vet asap....parvo can kill a pup in a matter days if not treated ...this is something that only a vet can treat ...they need iv fluids to have any chance of survival....please call your vet and ask if they think you should come in|`|RKhcVHCJaa	sounds like you need a vet honey....<br>  <br>  good luck with the pooch....|`|Wx35zRTYaa	He is eating grass because he has stomach upset. Please get him to the Vet ASAP|`|Yj3QoDZtaa	Please take your pet to a GOOD vet.  He could be dying!  It doesn't take long for these lilttle guys.<br>  <br>  A Fellow Pet Lover.|`|cGQTsi6Zaa	Sounds like either a blocked intestion, in which case your dog could die if you don't get him to a vet in time.  Or, he has probably drank a bad liquid or ate something poisoness, but not enough to kill him, but just enough to make him very sick.  In any case, if you know he is sick, why haven't you taken him to a vet in the first place, instead of asking anyone here for answers.  If you were sick, I bet you wouldn't be asking questions, but would be at your doctors quickly!!|`|dd06583abd91bf83e1723764987d0450aa	I know every one says this, but you need to take your dog to the vet ASAP!! It's something a pro should answer.
VipX0hhoaa	First of all, I would like to commend you for asking for this kind of advice before getting your dog. It shows that you ultimately want what's best for your future dog and will be a good owner. However,a one bedroom apartment isn't really an ideal living space for a large dog like a German  Shepherd. Also, 8 hours alone every day for any puppy/dog is a very long time. Dogs are pack dogs and need companionship constantly. Maybe you could get a different pet, or, if you are really set on getting a dog, wait until your schedule permits it and wait until you're sure that you can devote enough time and effort into caring for one.|`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	If you do decide to get a Shepard...I personally think they are great dogs...make sure it's ok with your landlord first.  I rent out an upstairs apartment and my homeowners insurance will not cover the home if my tenants have a shepard, pitbull or rottie...so therefore these breeds are forbidden on the property.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	NO! Not at all!! I have a German Shepard. I got him when he was 7 weeks and and he is now 16 weeks. I walk him twice a day for 30-45 minutes on top of playing fetch with him in the back yard for various amounts of time. He is still full of energy. German Shepards are very high energy dogs!! They also need lots of attention and training. They only make good "apartment dogs" if they are given the proper exercise etc. Plus, board dogs get into trouble. My pup is constantly getting into things! I have had to put all of the trashcans up to where he cannot get them, lamps, etc. Another thing to consider is house breaking.. How do you plan on doing this when you are gone for this amount of time each day? You shouldn't leave a dog in a kennel for more than a few hours at a time. <br>  <br>  Seeing as how you do not have much time to devote to an animal I would recommend you get two small older dogs. An older dog will have less energy, therefor needing less excercise. And I say get two because if you're not there he/she will need a companion. I highly recommend that you don't get a large breed dog!! (Boxer, GSD, etc.)<br>  <br>  hope this helps!! Good luck finding the right dog!!|`|2821e642f26e1d2d0daab24df234f001aa	Since you are gone for 8 hrs a day and the pup would have to be alone I don't think a pup would suit your needs (if there was someone else at home and the pup wouldn't be alone for that long then the apt. wouldn't be an issue).  Maybe you could consider an older dog from the shelter that is already past the teething and potty training stage and wouldn't destroy your apt. while you are working.|`|8wqm4xckaa	I don't think putting a german shepard in an apartment would be a good idea. They are a working dog, they need to be active all the time. Walking it wouldn't be enough. I would suggest a small dog. Do your reasearch, any breed called "working class" or "hunting class" I would avoid.|`|DxRWfo3vaa	I have a large dog and a soon to be small apartment. Exercise is key here, the dog shouldn't be left alone, so if you must get a dog look into doggie day care and/ or someone to walk your dog while your out since your hours are odd. Honestly, I can't give mine up but I wish the situation was different, believe me a large dog needs the space, exercise and companionship.|`|5acc79d0468c275059f96fa9f4778b7faa	No, ur place is way to small! Plus I had one and it totally torn the place up! Maby a golden retriever but defently not a german shepard!|`|6COVFB1paa	Are you serious?!  Of course it's not acceptable to get a German Shepherd.  Your place is too small.  And, you won't be home much.  I wouldn't even keep a small dog alone all day.  A German Shepherd is a very highly intelligent dog.  Remember - Rin Tin Tinn?  War dog.  Police dog.  They get extremely bored easily if not challenged.  Think destruction to your entire apartment.  And, they are very much a pack animal (like wolves which they look like).  I can see if you had the dog for a long time, and then had to move to a small place due to emergency.  Even then, I think it's cruel unless it's an elder dog.  I can already hear the lonely sound of a very unhappy puppy or adult dog - terribly sad howl.   Be unselfish and think about the dog over yourself.<br>  <br>  I know this is not what you want to hear - but really, no animal should be left alone a good part of the day without a companion.  Human or fellow animal buddy.  It's not humane.  Who's going to let the dog out for a pee/poop break during your work hours, at least once?  Can you afford to pay someone to do it for you?  Are you willing to forget about going out after work with your friends because you have the dog waiting at home for you?  Do you do sports?  Do you take off with friends on the weekends that don't allow the dog to be present?  That dog, if healthy, will live for up to 15 years.  Are your prepared for that committment now?  Do you have $3000 per year to devote to it for food, toys, grooming, books, replacement of damaged items, and the scariest of all - the vet expense?   The basic shots alone for him will be about $120 per year.  Then there is the heartworm meds $50 per year, parasite/flea/tick prevention, and maybe extra innoculations depending on what is prevalent in your area.  Like leptospirosis.  Oh, and you definitely want the Shepherd fixed thats about $250.  And if he gets sick and needs blood work?  My heavens - $200 easily.  That's just the tip of the ice berg.  Also, think about the time and commitment it takes to train the animal.  You may end up having to go to obediance and/or behavioural training.  A Shepherd is a lovely animal, had them as a child, but they are also good killing machines, and need proper socialization, guidance and handling.  It all takes time and energy.  <br>  <br>  Think about the problems you may get into with your neighbours or your landlord.<br>  <br>  Please wait until you have a bigger place and someone who could help to look after the animal.  Resist the urge.  It will pass.<br>  <br>  In answer to below gal's comment - working full-time - would you want to be left alone 8 hours a day with nothing to do, all by yourself?  I would have to say most full-time working people shouldn't have dogs, period.  Especially if you can't afford a doggie sitter.  It's human lifestyles that have changed in the last 50 years.  The dogs should not have to pay for our industrial aged lives.|`|AA10223660	atleast you asked this question my opinion no same living space, gone for 8 plus hours every day not good maybe a fish would be better for now i know you probally dont want to hear that but you must think of the animal this is a long term commitment and it is not fair if you do get the dog and 6 months to a year later you realize this is not a good situation for you and the dog good luck|`|vM2rQNp8aa	Dogbreedinfo.com is a very informative, well put together website with lots of different information for may breeds, including living space recommendations. <br>  In response to Gina F's post, though, MOST people who have animals do work full time jobs- you just have to make your own arrangements as to how you'll see the dog has everything he needs while you're away- puppy pads would probably be good to use while you're at work. <br>  Hope the website helps!
NxRBzSbFaa	I agree with the other two that he is about to shed.  I assume he is somewhat new to you or you would have seen that the last time(s) he shed.  He should shed in the next several days to a week.  To help make it a good shed, increase the humidity in the cage to about 65-70% for the next several days to a week.  It can't hurt to let him have a "swim" in the tub a couple times over the next few days as well.  Just make sure the water is not too warm or too cold.  And, keep an eye on him to make sure he is OK.  About 10 minutes each time will do.  Make sure the water only comes up about 1/2 way on his body.  You don't need it very deep.<br>  <br>  If you have had him a while and you know he is not going to shed because he just did weeks or a month ago, I'd google reputable sites like ballpython.com, anapsid.org and kingsnake.com and look for information.  If you don't get good answers there, I'd take him to a reptile vet for a professional diagnosis.|`|LysHfKl5aa	Probably means he is about to shed. Also a decline in eating is common right before they shed. It was funny my ball had a mouse tank mate for a week until he was done shedding. The snake would curl up to sleep and the mouse would sleep on him...then one day..gone and all I saw was the bulge in his stomach.|`|82987c5133eb520901fdacb24b4dafb5aa	sounds like it is getting ready to shed...|`|mfo3PnxZaa	If they just faded over the last week or so, he is getting ready to shed.  His eyes should turn a grey color as well.  He will return to his normal color and then shed within a week of returning to his normal coloring.<br>  <br>  If he has faded over a long time period, it is a natural thing.  Their colors tend to fade a bit as they grow.
SVKAKCTWaa	There could be many factors. It's likely your bird may be pulling its own feathers out of boredom. Buy a variety of bird toys, but don't put them all in the cage at once, rotate them roughly once a week to keep your bird amused. <br>  The bird may also be trying to build a nest, and birds will line the nest with their own feathers if nothing else is available. You can buy nesting material from a pet shop if this is the case. <br>  If your bird is caged with another bird, it is possible that the other bird is pulling the feathers out. <br>  Your bird could also be moulting, which is normal in the warmer months. <br>  If you have recently changed the brand of bird feed you use, then the food may be the problem, but if you haven't it is unlikely. <br>  Also, look at where the cage is - make sure there are no drafts, that it's not too hot or too cold, and not too noisy. These factors can cause the bird stress, which sometimes results in them plucking their feathers. <br>  The feather loss alone isn't a big problem, but if your bird also seems tired, doesn't move often or isn't eating and drinking much, this means your bird is unwell and you will need to seek advice from your vet.|`|5IuPWkCnaa	He/she might be picking out its feather's or could just be the food.|`|e19097ac01321a56ba581c169ebcca62aa	It could be stress, I have an Amazon that was severly abused, he is about 30yrs old now. When I first saw him, he was totally bald, he looked awful, now he has grown feathers back, but he is still very wary of peoples hands.|`|1wyKnT4vaa	It could be stress or diet related, the 2 most common factors.  It may even be a sign of getting older, and health somewhat in decline.|`|4b9cc385dc84abe4827046b32a118141aa	Is your bird a cockatiel? There is a breed of cockatiels that tend to be bald right below the crest. It could be that or a number of things. Your bird could also be moulting.|`|jYAs9ogtaa	Usually this is because of stress, lack of stimulation, behavioral.|`|8b7XpkVXaa	Could be one of many reasons. They can feather pick through boredom/not receiving enough attention. Older birds may lose more feathers when they moult (usually once yearly). Or for birds that like to eat 'human' foods oily foods have been known to cause feather loss. I hope that helps, but if it's very excessive and you are worried, i would go see a vet...
AA10421992	Your dog may very well have an ear infection or ear mites. I would take your dog to the vet, get a diagnosis, proper medication to treat the problem. Benadryl will not clear it up, that is simply a reliever.  You can give a dog Benadryl to relieve itching. Here is a site with the correct dosage <a href="http://animalsunlimited.net/meds.htm" rel="nofollow">http://animalsunlimited.net/meds.htm</a> Just use it to give your dog a little relief  untill you get an appointment to have the dog seen by a vet !!!!|`|818d08cdc12bf127e923c27c6d98f0f9aa	Like others have pointed out, there might be other reasons than allergies that'll make him scratch his ears. <br>  <br>  Either way, I'd advice to rather call your vet for advice. <br>  I'd never give my animals any drug without having an OK from the vet, an actual professional instead of a bunch of people on the net, better safe than sorry.|`|20lFo07jaa	Benedryl will help ease the effects of inhalant or contact allergies.  However, head shaking indicates a possible foreign object in the ear canal in ADDITION to the allergies.  Also, when a dog is suffering from allergies to their food, antihistamines will have a minimal effect.<br>  <br>  I recommend a consultation with your vet, and an exam of the ears to make sure there are no foxtails, ear mites, or other bothersome things in the ear canals.  Then please talk to your vet about discovering the source of the allergy.  If a week on antihistamines does not work for the itching and redness, you MUST approach the food allergy issue, because Benedryl will not affect the atopic allergic reaction.<br>  <br>  But please, before you give your dog a drug to treat a condition of uncertain origin, ALWAYS consult with your veterinarian.|`|c7ce2655e6a574392500d53a18c4aa0caa	When our dog had bee stings (noticable swelling, unlike what you described), he winkingly told us to go ahead and give our 40 lb. mutt 25 mg from time-to-time if he drove us insane, too.<br>  <br>  We've only done it once or twice, but it might give your guy a little relief UNTIL you get to clean the ears a/o meet with the vet.<br>  <br>  Also, don't panic on the blood in the ear - a lot of canine ear wax is the same color red and may make things look worse than they really are.|`|fp0IoemJaa	I would first contact your vet. Your dog could very well have an ear infection. Constant shaking of the head and scratching the ear are all signs of infection. I would see the vet to rule that out first before giving the dog Benadryl.|`|k1SyNkdqaa	He may have an ear infection. I Would take him to the vet but i dont think you should give him benadryl.|`|6Gix1D8Qaa	take him to a doctor, don't take any chances!|`|883ceb217ec4bfe374c4f894b4cf164faa	Why not treat the allergies in the first place? Seems to make sense. Go to the vet.|`|9434n90Faa	I give my border collie two tablets a day, one in the morning, one in the evening.  She weighs about 40 pounds though.<br>  <br>  Make sure that this is actually skin allergies rather than an ear infection.  Benadryl won't do anything for his ears. <br>  <br>  Check with your vet before starting him on any type of medication, though.|`|AA12223774	Yes, your dog can take benedryl but it requires certain dosages. <br>  <br>  As stated, by others, I recommend taking your pup to the vet to properly diagnose his issue. Ear itching could be due to mites, an ear infection as well as allergies.  Giving the dog benedryl will not help if your dog has mites or an ear infection.|`|AXsMeCNjaa	beyond just the benadryl, it's a good idea to use a topical cream for the itchy spots and redness. i NEVER use human products to address this for my dogs, but i do use raw aloe from a plant i have right outside my house. my dogs respond very well to it. they don't try to lick it off and even sit very still when i rub it on their sore spots. just like you can use it for your own sunburns, i've applied a thin coat on red spots in the ears when they've been itching them too roughly, plus on a healing belly after a spay, and i imagine you can use it for hives and other breakouts on the body as well. it's all natural and very soothing to the dogs. it heals the skin's surface rather quickly and minimizes their scratching of irritated areas. my vet OKed the approach too. if you don't have a plant somewhere on your block, raw aloe is sold in many specialty markets -- but always use raw. don't bother with the bottled lotions that contain aloe. that won't cut it and might make the irritation worse.|`|E1Z3EfIUaa	You should take your dog to a vet because benadryl is to relieve the symptom not the problem, so it wil still be there. I was actually told to give my daughter benadryl for an allergic reaction (today) going to think that over. Good luck hope your dog feels better!|`|EeG23eQUaa	i know people that give benedryl to their dogs, but i've been yelled at by my vet for giving dogs human medications because their livers dont process it like we do.  best idea is to call a local vet and just ask.|`|cff0dfd041f792ae85e891c6bfad974daa	do not give your dog Benadryl!!!|`|dEZEc1E8aa	You should not give your pet any medication with a recommendation from the vet for dosage/frequency/etc.  My vet has recommended benadryl for my dog before because of an ear infection.  Take your pup to the vet & find out whats going on in those ears for a course of action to follow.|`|j4dDDcQraa	I give my dog benedryl.  He is 40 lbs and I am suuposed to give him 1 pill every 4-6 hours.  Above 45 lbs you are supposed to give him 2 pills every 4-6 hours...  Dogs metabolize medicine faster than humans- that is what the vet told me.  Try that first and see if he stops scratching, then I would give it a day or so then bring him to the vet.  Benedryl doesn't make my dog sleepy, but some other dogs it does- it just depends on your dog.
bZsrX0Ytaa	Because they are a relatively rare breed, a RESPONSIBLE breeder will probably charge a good chunk of money.<br>  <br>  If you're finding Cotons for under $1,000, I'd be suspicious.|`|883ceb217ec4bfe374c4f894b4cf164faa	That's because dogs are not "products". I'd be surprised if a reputable breeder would sell to you anyway, with questions like this.
CVCpHjsdaa	Hahaha, this made me laugh. This is completely normal. Your cat is becoming an adult and instead of being playful and crazy, it is becoming tired and lazy. LOL. Like someone said, you could try catnip, but it affects cats differently. I would recommend trying a laser light. It works on my recently adult cat, but she only plays for like 5 minutes. Then she's back to being lazy again.|`|04015e2c9787d3d2704d053be85a754faa	The best answer I can give you is, as humans grow up we change and mature, maybe he is.|`|i7fhduBVaa	We'll as your cat grows and is a male he needs to get spayed if he is indoor. Because male cats want to mate. <br>  ?|`|ilOyQ6CNaa	well if he still eats and drinks and visits his litterbox regularily then im assuming its normal, (im not a vet tho!) but if he acts lke he doesnt want you to touch him, and he doesnt eat or drink or poop for a while than he might be sick, when cats hav fevers it hurts them when u touch them :S my cat was a little bit sick for a while he wud hide in the basement bny himself we just thought he wanted some space but then one day he stopped drinking and eating so we had to rush him to a vet he was SO sick :S so be very observant!|`|VdbhuUYBaa	I don't know the ratio of cat years to human years but it sounds like your kitty is becoming a "teenager"!|`|pq28I2sDaa	CATNIP I also have a kitten that is now older as yours she is doing the same i give her a sniff of catnip and boy look out she does the matrix moves down the couch then across the coffee table , matrix on the love seat, computer  table look out.

kTjDOteIaa	People are gonna tell you that there aren't mini aussies!!!  <br>  I HAVE THEM!!!! Before you try and educate her... educate yourself... look up NAMASCUSA and MASCA (North American Miniature Australian Shepherd Club of the USA and Miniature Austrailian Shepherd Club of America) These are the sites that mini aussies are registered with to be shown, do agility, Etc!!! There are others but these are the most widely known. And no they can't be registered with AKC or ASCA... they're height does not reach the Aussies Standards!!!!<br>  <br>  Ok! <br>  To answer your question. they do shed a significant about. They are no different than Standard Aussies... same coat!<br>  They require brushing daily, and bathes, some people take them to the groomer monthly. But if you maintain thier coat and keep them clean. You won't have a problem with them shedding all over your house!<br>  <br>  If you want more information on the breed. That you can't get from here. Because people are stubborn and won't do thier research about the mini aussie breed... just automatically assume they don't exist and is a BYB term! You can email me... i allow email on YA! <br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  P.S. the thumbs down won't bother me!|`|AA11826043	Sorry, no such thing as a Mini Aussie.  <br>  If you want an Aussie, you should look to a breeder who breeds responsibly, that is, true working Aussies at the weight and height specified in the breed standard. <br>  <br>  And yes, Aussies have a double coat that sheds at regular intervals.|`|883ceb217ec4bfe374c4f894b4cf164faa	Yes, they do.

QdfqlMRoaa	No.  When your female is in the process of giving birth, you should not feed her anything. Keep plenty of water available to her but that's it. <br>  Should your girl need a c-section, her tummy having any food in it puts her at risk of throwing up, which can be dangerous during surgery. <br>  <br>  Plus - adult dogs lack the proper enzymes to digest cow milk properly.  (limited goat milk is okay, but not during labor)<br>  Sugar is a no-no as a general rule but some honey or mollasses may be in order when her energy is too low. If your seeing a decrease in energy during labor that concerns you, call the vet before trying anything on your own.<br>  <br>  Raw eggs are good, including crushed egg shells. But again, not during labor.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Uhmmm.. NO.. Why would you give her that? If you are wanting to help her produce good milk.. Give her yogurt, or cottage cheese, goats milk, or a nice cooked steak.|`|LPEO6AsCaa	Not unless you want her to throw up!  No I have never given my dams anything but water durring whelping..|`|2821e642f26e1d2d0daab24df234f001aa	I know a couple good ethical breeders and have bred my girl as well and I've never heard of this.  I usually boil some chicken when my dog is due to deliver and get the broth from the chicken and freeze it in ice cube trays.  During whelping I offer her some of the frozen chicken broth cubes and when she is all done giving birth I offer her some of the cooked chicken with a little tablespoon of yogurt (the kind with the live cultures).<br>  <br>  Sure they can eat the placentas, but I wouldn't let her eat more than 2 or 3 because it can cause diarrhea if she eats too many.|`|C0CM03uyaa	I do not suggest that. Dogs don't need and should not have milk or sugar. If you want to offer her something during whelping at least make it healthy. The very best thing she can eat during giving birth is the placenta sacks. There is no better nutrition. Allow her to eat those and leave the milk in the fridge where it belongs.|`|M3jRtq2Aaa	I have never heard that.  Do you mean during pregnancy or during labor itself?  In labor, dogs don't usually eat at all. I wouldn't see a problem with it during pregnancy at all, but some people swear milk is bad for dogs.|`|y87HGa2paa	where did you hear this??  what a crock.  milk can cause digestive distress and raw eggs can have salmonella.|`|0gxaAswWaa	Wow...who made that one up?

The Internet should just be a supplement, not your main resource.|`|OgVmHwW6aa	To make sure the puppies come out healthy, stand on your head, juggle a beach ball on your feet, and whistle "Dixie".  It will be just as effective.<br>  <br>  Do your poor dog a favor and get a good book on canine reproduction.

I would not give sugar, but you can give Nutri Cal or Karo Syrup.  Almost every professional breeder supplements with NutriCal, and many are now also using the calcium in the form of milk, yogurt, or cottage cheese.  Many breeders are also using vanilla ice cream during whelping, but the AVMA still does not recommend that due to all of the additional ingredients.  A canine reproduction specialist can also recommend the calcium and NutriCal if you have one near you.|`|l2csTUU3aa	Hi,<br>      If your dog is in labour then don't give her anything to eat during this process.   As each pup is born she will eat the after-birth and packaging that encases the pup.   I have  video footage of my fox terrier Lucy doing just this with  a litter of 5 pups sometime ago.  She went through this procedure with 3 litters, so I think it is a built in instinct.  Eating this will nourish her through the ordeal.   Water may be provided though.   If she will let you, you might assist her with the delivery.  Don't get in the way though.  The father was watching the birth and moved closer for a better look. He was told in no uncertain terms to stay away.<br>  <br>  Regards Robert|`|r9YfHeq4aa	No to all three.  When my dog whelps, I only offer her water sparingly.  If for any reason she has problems and has to go to the vet, food in her belly will cause her more problems.  If she has to be put under anesthesia, this can cause her to vomit and choke on it.  I worked for many years as a vet tech and this is the number one reason why they say no to food or water before surgery (the same is true in humans) Let her lick ice cubes if she really needs to.  Also, if you have fed her right during her pregnancy, you have nothing to worry about as far as her being able to offer the pups quality milk, unless she has an underlying problem that you arent aware of. In truth, I have never heard of offering this concoction to a whelping mother.  ???|`|tHS6dY7aaa	Dogs should not be given sugar at all. Milk can upset their digestive systems.  I have hard of people giving egg yolks, at least once per week depending on the size of the bltch throughout the pregnancy.

f36b3416e662f2572dd625beb7b6745caa	What sort of tropical fish are you keeping?<br>  The key to stopping/controlling it, is to find the actual cause!<br>  High Nitrate levels in a fish tank is the main cause of algae growth.<br>  I'd advise firstly to buy a nitrate test kit from your local pet store or aquarium. Test your tank water to see if high levels of nitrate are detected. The kit will have a color chart for you to go by.<br>  Other causes would be over feeding & too much light. You can actually purchase a bottle of algae remover.<br>  <br>  If you dont want to add chemicals to the tank. Depending on what sort of fish you are keeping. You can always buy a little sucker fish who will eat up all your algae. Just be sure that the sucker you buy is compatible with your fish.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|wE2F5VOZaa	Do you mean the tank is suffering from green pea water? The best solution would be the famous blackout. Turn lights off and cover your tank with towels so no light gets inside. Don't feed your fish, and keep it like that for 4 full days. Algae needs lights and nutrients to grow so this method will kill most algae, except brown and BBA.<br>  <br>  You should perform a 50 water change after this treatment because dead algae decays in the water and can be toxic to your fish. Make sure you vacume your gravel very well.<br>  <br>  This method though won't work in the long run if you haven't eliminated the source of the problem. Feed your fish only once a day, and reduce tank light exposure to 6-8 hours a day.<br>  |`|T86Izyweaa	its just algae.<br>  every tank gets it.. it would properly be a good idea to get one of those fish that eats the algae off the wall of the tank.<br>  <br>  otherwise you should get a stronger filter or a smaller tank to suit your current filter

Surely you took them when you saw the aftermath of the attack. It's very horrible and it's best they go. Birds hide illness and weakness out of instincts....poor things.<br>  <br>  Not knowing what attacked them could cause them serious infections or bleeding to death...it could, it might.....<br>  <br>  A cat or extreamly large rat. Something could of snuck in easily. Hard to say what. Just don't know what.....a mouse is too small the birds would of tore it in half first.....<br>  <br>  You could have all of the blood stains tested to see if any of it belongs to the animal.

They will likely need to be put on antibiotics and the parrot will need to be treated. Birds die of shock very easily. The vet might also be able to help determine what happened.<br>  <br>  I don't think a rat could take off a parrot wing so easily; remember, parrots can bite fingers off.<br>  <br>  I'm wondering if maybe a raccoon may have done it. They're smart enough to open cages and can bite a wing off.|`|PRQEt6oiaa	Wow that is scary and sad. Is there any way a cat or raccoon could have gotten in? Where do you live country, city? Are they in a cage and was it off the ground? Was the cage damaged?<br>  How are they doing now?|`|unRxUIphaa	Please take them to the vet... Birds hide their pain... and they also will die if shock ...|`|FGn8okQQaa	How can they possibly seem fine after that!?  How fine do you think you'd feel if you had your jaw broken and your arm ripped off?  Because that poor bird is in unimaginable pain from that (even if he's acting as normal as possible; birds hide feelings of unwellness) and will starve to death if you do nothing!  Take them both to the emergency vet right now; they are lucky to have survived that kind of attack at all and will not be around much longer without some serious medical care!  If they make it (honestly, I have more hope for the lovebird, but he needs emergency medical care as well), keep them in the house from now on and never put them outside unless they can be supervised the whole time.  <br>  <br>  Lovebirds can be aggressive, but I'm not sure about their ability to rip off an entire wing and toss it where you can't find it!  It's likely another animal did attack and tear it off through the cage bars; that does happen.|`|ZxBzDYKfaa	the birds (A Hitchchock)?|`|MTQV6qljaa	My guess is a cat or a raccoon. You may not have seen any lately, but that does not mean that they arent there. Especially at night. They have their ways of getting into any if determined! As for a rat, or a mouse. I dont think so. Your parrot could easily kill them. I would suggest leaving your birds inside from now on. I never leave my birds outside just because of that reason. I have cats and raccoons all over my house. You really need to take your birds to the vet ASAP though.|`|saPJqA9Caa	Wow.. well, regardless of how it happened, I think it's best to focus on the now and future..<br>  <br>  As stated by someone else, get the birds to the vet now!  have them looked over to make sure no further damage was done.<br>  <br>  Then, revisit your current practice of leaving them overnight in a garage.. Garages are NOT air or weather tight, so any rodent could easily gain access.  In addition, noises are more easily transferred, so even if NO animal gained access but instead smelled them and then clawed and howled, it would terrorize them and cause great stress, which can severely mentally damage and even physically harm your feathered friends.<br>  <br>  Realize that you are their sole protector, so if it takes extra effort to keep them in the house with you, I'd easily sacrifice the time and effort..

oDVx7nSxaa	Most people who are allergic to cats are allergic to the dander, which is on the fur from the cat grooming themselves.  So from that perspective, a Sphinx will cause just as much of an allergic reaction as any other cat.  And they need quite a bit of care.  If not properly bred, their skin is quite oily and they need frequent bathing.  They still need to be groomed, and are subject to skin disorders.  They also get quite cold, and need to be protected from that either with a heated bed or a sweater.  And surely they must be kept indoors, as they have no fur to protect them from the sun or cold.  <br>  <br>  Prior to getting one, which would be a major investment, you really should spend time at a breeder's house to see if they bother you or not.  There is also the more conventional route of seeing an allergist for prescription medication or even allergy shots, which would probably be cheaper than getting a Sphinx.|`|ISjFdI1taa	Yes it's not the fur that causes the allergy, it's the saliva (which contains a protein called FELD1), and the cat's urine (in the litter box) that causes the allergy.<br>  A Sphynx cat will still lick itself and urinate.<br>  Some Siberian cats are said to be hypoallergenic - my husband and daughter have cat allergies and they are fine with our Siberian.  It doesn't work for everyone though.|`|crjnnRoHaa	First of all, I found a place that breeds hypoallergenic cats.  You can check this out.  It sounds expensive but if you have the money and love cats, it'd probably be worth every penny!<br>  <a href="http://www.allerca.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.allerca.com/</a><br>  They aren't hairless so they are a bit cuter (I know that's subjective).<br>  Here's some info. on the Sphinx and it says that they are USUALLY hypoallergenic.  Read it thoroughly.<br>  <a href="http://www.catsofaustralia.com/allergy_to_cats.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catsofaustralia.com/allergy_t...</a><br>  It also mentions some other breeds like the Cornish Rex and Devon Rex.  The article does say that is the SALIVA that we are allergic to so even though a lot of cats may be called "hypoallergenic" that's not true in every case.  Here are some pictures of the two Rex breeds.<br>  <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images?_adv_prop=image&va=cornish+rex+cat&sz=all">http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...</a><br>  <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images?_adv_prop=image&va=devon+rex+cat&sz=all">http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...</a><br>  Some of them are pretty cute but some have those faces that "only a mother could love!", lol!  Seriously though, I think personality is so much more important in a pet than looks.  Sphinxs are also very beautiful.  Here's a great website on the breed for you to look over.<br>  <a href="http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/sphynx.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/sp...</a><br>  This site could hook you up with a reputable breeder in your area.  You could also get a dog that doesn't shed like a Poodle or are you allergic to them as well?  Have you thought about getting a shot every week or month?  Is that an option?  I know if I were allergic to my pets, I'd get a shot as often as I had to.  I know that shots don't work for everyone though and some people have a great fear of them.  What about like Allerga or another strong allergy medication?  I'm assuming that you've tried all of them???  I hope I helped you out.  I have a slight allergy to cats myself but oddly enough, more so to some cats than others.  I just get an itchy nose and sometimes itchy eyes but nothing too serious.  I think it'd be a great idea to try a Sphinx or Rex cat with maybe an agreement with the breeder that you could get a partial or full refund if your allergies are just too bad.  Maybe they would be kind enough to let you borrow one of their friendlier cats or you could try spending several hours in the breeder's home petting the cats and seeing if you have a reaction.

I know a few people with sphinx cats whose allergies behave quite well with the breed. If you have cat allergies I would do a 'test' and maybe spend some time around a sphinx cat and see how you react. That is a rather expensive breed and you would hate to be allergic only to find out you wouldn't be able to keep him/her. Good luck with everything!|`|6ymYMd2baa	Yes, if the allergy is in response to dander, not fur. Most cat allergies are based on dander, which coats the fur, so unless their allergist has been able to differentiate which is the actual source of the allergy, the only way to get some idea is to visit a home with only Sphynx and see if they react.|`|zItO5QgDaa	Most people are not allergic to the cat hair itself.

Especially for situations like this.  Look how to do that on the internet.<br>  Whatever you do, don't get in the middle of a dog fight with just your hands, or you could lose some fingers or worse.<br>  If you can't get pepper spray where you live, at least carry a good stick.  Thing is, if you beat another dog, YOUR DOG will attack it.<br>  Don't get his WIngwang cut off and ruin his malehood.  He'll get fat and lazy and won't be a decent dog.  Always carry little biscuits or things to reward him with when he does what you want, and scould him harshly when he does bad, but hitting him won't help you.  If you must, use a rolled up newspaper that doesn't hurt, but makes a good whallop sound.  But don't use it on other dogs, or you'll have a dog fight.<br>  This should teach you how to handle women, by the way. (Exc[ept for Feminists...

For example, if you have astigmatism, you can't get contacts.<br>  <br>  Some advice though- this question shouldn't be in Pets(Cats).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

2seP3SL5aa	First, let me address the person who said growling is fine. Growling is NEVER fine because it indicates a weak, nervous dog that should be put down due to fear aggression issues.<br>  <br>  Your dog is doing this because of a couple of reasons, one of which maybe the fact that he was not socialized early enough, however, a dog that is bomb-proof will not act the way he does wich leads me to believe that your dog has temperament issues.<br>  What you said about him not being aggressive is NOT true, he has the worst type of aggression there is and that is fear based aggression.<br>  He WILL lash out and BITE whatever and whoever is causing him to be afraid at any time he feels too uncomfortable.<br>  That is not a dog, it is a ticking time bomb waiting to go off and something you will have to deal with WHEN, not if, he bites someone, God forbid a small child! <br>  Hope I helped!|`|pc7ZjexJaa	growling is perfectly fine. it tells you when he doesn't like the situation and then you remove him from it immediately|`|rGlJ2FbUaa	More than obedience training you could benefit from a behaviourist.<br>  Growling besides body, tail and eye movements is one of the way dogs communicate. It is normal. It is only serious if it is a full bared snarl with teeth and gums showing. Dogs use all levels of lesser growls while playing etc. <br>  And yes it can lead to fear biting if the initial lesser growling is ignored by the person (idiot?) causing it and the dog is pushed/forced to his fear limits. It's the only way he can say "back off" you've pushed me too far. <br>  Does he growl at the sight or how near do folk have to be? Does he growl only when a hand is coming at him?<br>  If he has backed into a corner leave him alone. Allow him to come out when he is ready. A cornered animal has nothing left but biting. Does he have a crate he can go into so he can feel safe till he calms down?<br>  <br>  Get a special hi impact treat that he will only ever get from strangers. You and your family, folk your dog is comfy with will never ever give him. Keep it special for his fear so he has a reason to want to give it up. This could be liver, roll-over bits but not ordinary treats.<br>  Do not let folk approach him too close.   Allow him to learn to approach them!  Be near folk and pass over to them three half-inch (at most sized) treats. Have them stoop (to lower their height and be less threatening) and offer the treat. Even if he rushes in, grabs it and runs back he still "gave" up his fear even momentarily. Have them offer another treat. He'll start to think maybe these folk aren't so scary after all offering such great stuff he never gets anywhere else.<br>  If he won't even take a high impact treat from a stranger then he is very scared. Patience. He is saying he is still overwhelmed. And again I recommend getting behavioural modification help.<br>  Do not pet him, croon, talk etc while he is growling or while showing any nervousness etc. It is not reassuring him as you think. We only pet dogs when we like a behaviour so do not inadvertently be telling him you like his growling and fear. Laughter is a great tool. We only laugh when it is safe. I use laughter a lot with fearful dogs.<br>  Don't work him every day, every moment but most of the time.<br>  Take him to new places and stand back to where he can watch without being in full panic. As he calms see if you can get a foot or two closer to the source of his fear. Be very patient and slow. Take days and weeks. Humans have a tendency to push. To want a result too soon totally ignoring reality. Watch him and his body language to tell you when he is ready for the next step.  Do not force him. This is not helpful and only increases his fear. Imagine if you were terrified and were forced?<br>  Vary it by having people totally ignore him. This can make him feel safer because their scary attention isn't on him. They do not look or speak at him. If he approaches and sniffs them they still ignore him.<br>  Maybe after a while they could offer him a piece or two of your hi impact treat.<br>  Does he like to play? Have the stranger offer him the ball, stick, toy. Whatever method keep it light, fun, short (5 to 10 minutes) and sweet then go do something he can relax about for an hour or so. Then go train again.<br>  |`|XDnBTtwjaa	i have a chihuahua who is the same way. we try letting people in our house and letting them pet her as soon as they walk in. she's not as bad i think they just have to get used to people. Try socializing her with some new people.  |`|AA10148611	dont pull him if he doesnt want to walk. my aunts dog is like yours, what i did was, first, i took him out, in front our our house first. because thats the place he's most familiar off. we just sat there, and i let him play with his toys outside. then if he's used to being outside the house, i carry him and walk around our subdivision, maybe for a week or so. when he's familiar with the places we're going, i put him down and let him follow me, or let him chase his ball.. this way, your slowly introducing him to your community, and he will also be familiar with people, then eventually he will stop growling.
pnZnEOrZaa	The alpha factor<br>  <br>  "Dogs are animals, not human beings. They are pack animals by nature. Every pack has a leader, known as the alpha animal, who dominates and leads the other members of the pack. The alpha is the boss who makes decisions for the entire pack. Usually the pack will have an alpha male and an alpha female. All the other members of the pack form a hierarchy of dominance and submission where everyone has a place.........<br>  <br>  Being the pack leader does not mean you have to be big and aggressive. Nor does it mean that there has to be a battle of wills after which you are the victor. Anyone can be the pack leader. It is an attitude an air of authority. It is the basis for mutual respect, and provides the building blocks of communication between the two of you.

My dog for instances was given to me and my brother for a christmas present but she is my dads dog, no one really nows what a dog is thinking but they just chose an owner or favorite based on what you do for him.|`|bm8d6QpTaa	I certainly can relate. I have 2 dogs, a Shih Poo & a Shih Tzu and they are usually glued to me. I, like you am their caregiver and do all of the fun stuff with them. The minute my 17 yr old niece comes over, they both forget I exist. I do admit it is a relief at times, but I think the same, why are the ignoring me when I do all the stuff with them? It's just something new and exciting for them. They both love when anyone comes to visit, they will ignore me and stay with the guest as much as possible. I think they get tired of the routine. Plus, they always get even more attention when a family member or friend comes over. Its not a bad thing, it is great socialization. Trust me, your little guy will never forget you.
wrUsMG4Jaa	Its only dangerous if you're careless.<br>  <br>  Kennels usually screen dogs prior to boarding them, so you're covered in that area. But most kennels make you sign a release form saying that you won't file workers compensation if you get injured on the job.<br>  <br>  Working with animals always has its possible injuries, but a careful person thats aware of the surroundings is way less likely to get injured than someone who takes the job as a joke. |`|JczgcRrRaa	Yes and no. I volunteer at my local animal shelter.  You are exposed to all kinds of animal illnesses.  you are exposed to aggressive animals who will bite out of fear.  You may be bite, scratched or any number of other things.  <br>    I do this and expose myself and my pets at home to all of the above because the animals are worth my time, I do this for free.  If you take the necessary precautions you can reduce the risk of bites and exposure to illnesses.  I recommend taking a change of clothes and shoes.  Do not wear home what you wear in the kennel, this includes shoes.  <br>  <br>  The benefits out weigh the risks in my opinion.  But it is just my opinion, oh yea and learn how to correctly handle the animals this reduces your risk of injuring animals or the animals hurting you.  Good luck and have a ball.  I do!|`|c3316a5f71249d75a984bd40fa3e4358aa	Ask the people at the kennel if it is dangerous and if a dog bit you, would you be covered medically-doctor, time off, etc. If you fell down, would you be covered medicalley-doctor, time off, etc. Ask the other kennel workers and maybe they can enlighten you.|`|wbm3rbJ2aa	Not at all, if you are attentive!<br>  <br>  I work in a kennel, and I love it.

Why would you think a kennel job is dangerous.  Probably you would be the pooper scooper/|`|yahp7lykaa	Jessica is right - you should NEVER sign such a release form for any job -- your employers should have workers comp and plenty of liability insurance in case something happens to an employee, dog, or client.<br>  <br>  I'd answer your question by saying that it totally depends on the quality of the boarding kennel.  Look for a well-respected, highly recommended kennel in your area.  Check with the Better Business Bureau.  Visit and tour the facility.  Are workers wearing gloves?  Do they have air recirculation units installed per zoning codes?  Is the environment generally neat and tidy?<br>  <br>  Working in a kennel can be amazingly fun -- playing with the pups and enjoying that atmosphere.  But it's also hard work.  Most of the work in a kennel is (and should be) centered around cleanliness -- the routine of maintaining a safe environment for dogs and employees is not a lot of fun -- but it is exactly the precaution that will keep you safe.<br>  <br>  Also - ask a lot of questions - does the kennel just accept any dog who walks in?  Good kennels screen clients and maintain a "blacklist" of especially aggressive dogs.<br>  <br>  Accidents do happen in kennels or any other job -- but your potential employers should be committed to minimizing risks for everyone - on two legs or four - who enters the facility.|`|AA11757365	I've never heard of a kennel making you sign a release form in case you get injured on the job. This is why employers are required to carry workers compensation insurance.<br>  <br>  Yes, in can be dangerous. You have to do heavy lifting, can be scratched or bitten, deal with chemicals (like those used to disinfect), you will be hosing down kennels and floors which can cause for a "slip and fall". It can be a hard job for little pay. But if you love animals and love making sure they are comfortable and taken care of, then it's worth it. It's not all fun and games. You will also be exposed to some things that can be contagious to humans, as well as can take things home to your own pets. However, not very likely if proper Hygiene is in place. That is more of a risk if you work at a Vet's who also boards animals, since you will be in contact with sick animals as well. Regular kennels are usually only housing "well" animals and make sure they are current on all vaccines, flea preventives and are free of internal parasites. Pet sitting in someones home (or your own) is a bit different that working in a kennel since it's not quite a "home" enviornment. Give it a try, it can be a gateway to other animal related jobs. Good luck!!<br>  |`|SP9vSXyhaa	I work in a kennel and it's great. Where else can you get paid to play with dogs? Of course, you have to clean up, feed, and medicate as well. I don't think it's dangerous - but you do need to use common sense. Fear aggressive dogs are the trickiest, but they give warning signs (raised hackles, frozen stance, barred teeth to name a few). Just use your common sense, go slow, show them love, treat them well, and you will be fine! Good luck. I find this job very rewarding.|`|yyFUunAuaa	It is dangerous.

lyhnHhuWaa	They should be introduced gradually.  When you bring in the new kitten, place him in an isolated room with his own food, water and litter box.  Let the two check one another out by sniffing under the door.  Be sure to go in and spend time with the new kitty, but also offer plenty of affection and reassurance to your older cat.  Let them sniff one another out for about a week, then open the door to permit them to meet.  Don't worry about any hissing or growling that happens, as this is perfectly natural.  Only intervene if they are physically fighting.  Leave them out together for about an hour, provided there aren't any fights.  Do this every day, gradually increasing the time that they are together.  Always be sure that you are supervising the situation so you can intervene if necessary.  Once they are able to remain together without fighting for about 6 hours or so, you should be fine to leave the new kitty out all the time.  When you move the new kitty's litter box and food/water from the isolated room make sure you show him where they are or he may become confused.  Good luck to you... just be patient with the introduction and they'll be fine.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	buy a toy and rub the scent of the new cat on it and have it around the food dish of your cat and your cat will get use the the scent of the new cat.  also put your cats scent on a toy and give it to the new cat.|`|9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	A certain amount of spatting is inevitable because cats are territorial creatures. But you could bring home something with the new cat's scent on it so your older one will have a chance to get familiar with it. When you bring home the new kitten, have someone who isn't part of your kitty's 'family' carry him in, and close him up where the two can hear and smell each other, but not see for a couple of weeks.<br>  <br>  When you let them meet, expect some hissing and growling, but don't interfere unless there is danger to one kitty or the other. Once they settle who is the boss cat, they'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
x7FbYYYGaa	I was a Vet Tech for 10 yrs. I've seen a lot of furries come in with mast cell tumors, respiratory problems & skin problems all linked to second-hand smoke. So I would have to say that yes nicoteine is very dangerous to animals. It is also fatal to them if swallowed & they can become addicted to it if they are allowed to eat butts from an ashtray.|`|qKD9uFp2aa	A few years ago there was a duck that would hang out around the smoking area of the building where I worked. It'd pick up cigarette butts that were still lit and just stand around the smokers. If they weren't lit, sometimes it'd eat them.<br>  <br>  It eventually got really sick, and no one saw it again. I'm guessing it died.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Of course it is harmful to them. Animals have sensitive respiratory systems.

qAyXe978aa	We  have had 6 ragdoll cats over the years and they have always gotten along with other cats - especially the males.  The males are easy going cats and adapt to a routine quickly.  For the most part, male cats no matter what species, get along pretty well.  Hope this helps and what a lucky person you are to have such beautiful breeds of cats.|`|wjGDa1qGaa	They should all get along (in principal) personality type, well.|`|wvZ6slApaa	They should|`|4aAhEK9daa	Sure, why not?  All are quite laidback breeds.  I have Persian, an Exotic Shorthair and a Ragamuffin (offshoot breed of Ragdoll) and they were all adopted as adults and all readily accepted eachother.<br>  <br>  The key is SLOWLY introducing them.  Put the new cat in a room with its own food, water and litter.  Put a tshirt in with the cat to get its smell on it and then put the shirt with the existing cat then back again.  Once both cats seem relaxed and interested THEN let them interact with eachother while you supervise.<br>  <br>  Instead of getting a Himalayan from a breeder have you thought about checking shelters for one?  Persians and Himalayans are very high maintenance cats and are sadly one of the most often surrendered breeds at shelters.  Percy, the Persian in my avatar, was found as a stray in Seattle and no one claimed him.  I adopted him two years ago when he was 2 1/2.|`|4DcJ5aZoaa	yes they will. Well i have those three breeds and my cats do : ) 
6ymYMd2baa	It's an excellent idea to plan way ahead as the hobby of breeding pedigreed cats should never be entered into lightly. First, find a show to visit. See if there's a CFA or TICA show in your area. Start talking to Persian/Himmie breeders about breed clubs and who they might recommend as a source and  mentor for a show-quality neuter or spay for you to show. It's always good to have a mentor to help you get started, especially with a high-maintenance breed. Observe how they groom their cats throughout the show day. Keeping a show-quality Persian takes a lot of work and dedication to get a nice full long coat in good condition and it does differ from the amount of maintenance a good pet owner performs. <br>  <br>  Good breeders show their cats. The only valid reasons to breed pedigreed cats are for the preservation and improvement of the breed and part of that is testing your cats against the written standard of their registering body. Breeding pets should not be the main focus, but a byproduct of a good show-quality program where even the best-bred cats can produce pet-quality (non-show quality) cats. When a breeder is not breeding for TTH (Type, Temperament and Health) equally, and are producing nothing but pets, we call them backyard breeders. All 3 elements are equally important. What good is excellent type if the cat is nasty or has serious health problems? Great personality and/or great health can be found in a moggie, so without type, no reason to reproduce it on purpose.<br>  <br>  So, take a wander to a show, start asking questions (maybe even check with show management if they know of Persian breeders who are more approachable (some breeders are not, unfortunately...some are so focused on what they need to do during a show that they're not very interactive with the public). You are more likely to get access to a nice show-quality alter by showing you're serious but not pushy, and patient and very willing to learn. Too many prospective breeders want to jump in with the purchase of breeding cats without learning the ropes first and reputable breeders will not sell breeding cats to that sort of prospective breeder. They want to see that you're really committed to the idea and willing to take it slow before you're entrusted with good lines. And good lines are worth the effort...you will have access to that breeder for advice, you will have a much better shot at producing good cats with sound health and temperaments and bypass unnecessary frustrations of those in a hurry to either produce pets or who think that winning at shows comes easily and without effort.<br>  <br>  |`|AA10672818	the main cat club...somewhat like the american kennel club is c f a .............go to some meeting and help with a show...you will learn a lot....and meet real breeders,not those who overbreed and sell with out regards to the animal|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	I think you should first focus on fostering for an animal shelter and work on getting cats adopted out to good famlies.  when all the cats are in good homes then you can worry about adding more cats to this world.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Contact the breed club of your choice in your area. They can help you find a mentor.<br>  <br>  ADD: Good breeders are not part of the overpopulation problem. I see no issue with someone continuing on with purebreds to produce healthy cats with predictable traits. <br>  <br>  The overpopulation problem comes in with people that do not spay/ neuter their cats causing accidental litters, or people that breed irresponsibly with no concern for health or towards what traits the kittens will have either through mis-guided attempts at creating a "purebred" cat or just messing around with moggies. These are the cats that end up in shelters. Most good breeders take cats back if their family won't keep them, some require it by contract.
f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	It's really cute.  Whether your cats will like depends on them.  My cats would all sniff it, slap it a couple of times, then have a ball with the box it comes in.

One night won't hurt.
y7igESfUaa	I'd say it's going pretty well, actually. I brought home an 8 week old female to my 11 year old male a few months back and they acted very similar. My male was not the least bit happy that we brought a little girl into his territory. He did the same, hissing here and there but for the most part, left her alone. Actually, for the first night when I brought home the kitten, she hid in my basement for that entire night (I couldn't even find her). I was a bit worried, but you have to give them their space. They're in a new environment with new sounds and new smells and they need time to adjust. Just give your kitten some space for the first couple of days. He'll eventually come out and that's when the bonding will take place (between you and him). As for the two cats getting alone, it may take even longer. My kitten's 6 months old now and despite the fact that my male still doesn't like her, she'll get low to the ground, flatten her ears, and pounce on him when he walks by. Of course he just hisses a trots away. It's so cute, she wants to play and he wants nothing to do with her, ha. Good luck to you and your kitties!|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	First, is the new kitten clear of any contagious diseases?  If you didn't get a vet exam, separate them till you do.  FIV/FeLV testing is what you want so your new kitten doesn't make your other one sick.  If they can be in room together without fighting, make the visits longer each time.  Don't let the kitten hide.  Set him up in a room with his food, water, and litter box. Bring him out frequently and do as you did with your cousin.  Then let them go and see what happens.  It usually takes 2-4 weeks for things to settle down although all cats are different.  Yours may take to each more quickly. Just go with your gut.|`|0Nwt0H7aaa	Please understand that the two animals need separate spaces and time to adjust to the presence of another animal in their space.<br>   Each cat needs time to adjust to smells, sounds and the habits of not only the other animal, but YOU as well.<br>  Many folks offering advice fail to include the owner as an influence on the behavior of the animals involved!<br>  Like has been said above, separate them; they are not children who can be taught to follow rules of behavior!<br>  These were WILD ANIMALS at some point! Please treat them as such...<br>  Refer to my answer to another similar question here on Yahoo.<br>  Remember; separate everything for the first week, and EQUAL ATTENTION FOR BOTH.<br>  Dab both with the oil that tuna comes packed in, they will take it from there.<br>  |`|b6HaedRxaa	Right now I would let the 3 month old have some space, get used to the house and the new cat. I think slowly let them be together, but not too much cos we don't want a fight, but slowly a little more time per day so they will get used to each other without being together 24/7<br>  =)<br>  If he's hissing, just let him hide for awhile and let the 10 month old settle down for awhile, he is probably used to being 'top cat' and is a bit nervous.<br>  good luck! :]<br>  Hope all goes well.<br>  <br>  E:<br>  Yes, sprinkling corn starch and baby powder will help so they can't tell the different scents so there won't be problems, and having nails clipped is strongly advised.|`|HutNyjhmaa	We are registered cat breeders, and what we recommend to new pet owners, is to separate them in two rooms for about 2 weeks.. let them sniff each other under the door for a while.. then introduce them.. |`|RN1wGlWWaa	No, anytime you bring in a new cat/kitten, they should be isolated in their own room with litter pan, food & water for a few days.  The older cats will be upset, hiss, growl, etc.<br>  <br>  You also need to have your vet check them out before you do any introductions.  After a few days, put the kitten in a carrier and sit it in another room and let your other cat have some time checking him out and the kitten's room.<br>  <br>  Before you introduce them face to face, trim all nails and sprinkle some cornstarch baby powder on both and rub it in.  Let them have supervised time together.  Do not interfer if they do some hissing, growling, etc.<br>  <br>  If your 3 month old is not neutered, get him done now as you will have easier introductions later.|`|4oDfFoQFaa	So far so good.  Give the cats a chance.  Cats are very territorial and will fight for the space.  But you just have to hope for the best.  Give them both as much as attention as you can.  I am sure it will be fine.  It may take a couple of weeks, but I think that they will get along fine.  Good luck with your new cat and the boy cat!
MYNezY8Gaa	i think he is just setting in.<br>  I also have a 1 yr old himalayan. i got him last Oct. the first 3 weeks or so, he literally slept on top of my head on the pillow...he then found other fav spots to sleep in (pretty much every inch on my apt).<br>  Even now, he still won't sleep w/ us in the bed, only if he's not feeling well. But he did pick up a new habit the past week or so to come on the bed anywhere from 2AM - 4 AM sit on me and purr as loud as he possibly can and lick my hands...lol. It's annoying but super cute.<br>  I think you're doing great.<br>  <br>  As for the Christmas decorations...maybe it's different w/ every cat. But last xmas, i too was scared of what he might do, so we actually tied the xmas tree so he wouldn't knock it down. The only thing he did is sleep under the xmas tree (which made for great 1st xmas pics) and play w./ the wrapping paper when it came down to opening presents. Good luck and MERRY CHRISTMAS <3|`|ij51EeDPaa	i have a cat and when he was a kitten he went absolutely CRAZY when he was around christmas decorations ( he knocked over the tree oncece too ) your cat will be fine hes just settling in let him explore and soon hell feel comfortable in your house |`|lyhnHhuWaa	He's just settling in, and you're doing just fine... don't beat yourself up.  I'm sure the move was stressful on him, and the changes in his new environment (Christmas decorations) may just be adding to his stress.  The adjustment period is a little longer for some cats than others, and I'm sure he'll be fine.  Just let him do whatever seems to make him comfortable and be sure to reassure him often.  It may help to add some Feliway diffusers to your home.  They plug in to your wall outlets and work like the plug-in scent diffusers.  They contain a pheromone that is calming to cats and can help to reduce some of their stress and anxiety.  Check around for them online, as they are a little pricey and some places sell them for less than others.|`|NKNJm5uSaa	Well, let's look at your last comment first.  Christmas decorations can be very dangerous for your cat.  Go to the ASPCA website.  They have a section on dangers/poisons for cats.  <a href="http://aspca.org." rel="nofollow">http://aspca.org.</a>  <br>  <br>  Your older cat may not be tolerating the new kitten in your absence.  It happens.  My first question would be whether you introduced them slowly or just brought the new cat into the house?  Generally speaking, if you take the new cat/kitten and put them in a separate area with their own food/water/litterbox for a week to two weeks, they socialize much better.<br>  <br>  Cats a territorial animals and having them "play" under the door between rooms before introducing them can cut down on territorial aggressiveness later on.  And, were I to take a guess, that's what I imagine is going on here.<br>  <br>  Eventually, they will either learn to cohabitate well or they will each claim an area of the house and not socialize with each other at all.  You cannot force them to like each other, unfortunately.  <br>  <br>  But do look up the aspca info and be sure you're not putting up decorations that can harm your cats.|`|fac19b1dbb2ff2df17b3984f0bd6c4b3aa	Maybe the child is pulling him around making him afraid or maybe the christmas lights are scaring him,cuddle him more give him lots of reassurance he will grow out of this.I have 2 persians my huge black eastern european black Pearl is very timid and a real mummies boy my old lady who is 24 is a harridan in comparison and will bully my Rottweiler as well!
aBpEPOCdaa	I know this usually isn't a cat thing, but try feeding them at specific times and separate them while feeding it at all possible.  They will adjust if they want to get fed.|`|NaMvJKsuaa	You should know that overeating is a bad habit which could cause future problems to the cat.It may have problems in the stomach and being fat may cause diseases such as diabetes and others.You should find way to give the cat three or five meals and not more than the required daily quantity.Ask an expert about the amount of food it should take|`|XW9FqleYaa	have them eat from two different bowls andthe one for your kitten make sure it is smaller.  if ur cat can jump somewhere were the kitty can't put there food up there,  or treat them like dogs and only feed them at certain times like when you get home put a bowl of food infront of them to eat then take iot away so they dont ewat it when your not around.|`|brLAscR6aa	Always let your cats have as much food and water as they want.A cat  will not overeat till it pukes like a dog will.Overeating will not cause a loose stool.There is something else wrong.Call your vet and see what he or she says.I bet they will want to set up an appointment to see your kitten.|`|HXlsQ2LZaa	food in 2 different rooms.<br>  i highly doubt your kitten is overeating. it is growing and eats more food.|`|7d431c07c82c769129c857eddd668bb8aa	Over-eating dry food would not cause your kitten to have loose stools. She/he most likely has worms (most kittens are born with them), or if you are giving him/her cows milk--both of these things would cause this condition. Just make an appointment with your vet for a check up for your kitten. You did not say how old this kitten is, but if he/she is over 4 months old, you'll need to start thinking about having kitty spayed/neutered anyway. So, it's a good time for your kittens first vet visit + you can save yourself some money on office visits by addressing several things with your vet at one time--loose stool issue, first baby shots, etc. Call your vet first to set the appointment, and they most likely will tell you to bring in a stool sample. Good luck with your new kitten.|`|8Pl2DdEzaa	You know this is the exact same thing that is happen to my cats and all we did was giving them separate bowls.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I allow kittens to free feed for the first 4-5 months; after that they get scheduled meals twice a day.  You may need to start regulating all your cats/kittens food at set times and stop leaving food out all day.<br>  <br>  Cats do better on a mix of canned and dry foods - all dry is not really healthy anymore.
S9tilPJMaa	With the safety standards that they have on baby toys these days, I would think that the cats would be fine with it. And that toy is made for young babies. You might even be able to figure out a way to connect catnip filled cat toys to it. I think they would love it. I still have one in my attic. I might bring it down and let the cats try it. Thanks.|`|dWed21jUaa	You may only want to let them play with it when you're home and maybe keep it up when you're asleep/gone.<br>  <br>  It looks safe enough, but cats get crazy, so they might pull something off.

If he's vomiting blood that means he's probably had this infection for many months. Both of these conditions are life-threatening and your cat will likely die if not seen by a vet *immediately*. Bring a stool sample with you if you can when you go to the vet and this will aid in identification of any parasites.|`|45e1c3fbb80d6531ecb393ac6e5e57f9aa	~If any of my cats vomits the slightest amount of blood I would immediately take it to the vet, regardless how I get there or where it is.

Cats are lactose intolerant and it can seriously upset their digestive system.<br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|f8316b851202bfa29e2b37b5add98d36aa	I'm with Melissa, he needs to see a vet as soon as possible.  Not alone for possible stomach or esophageal damage, he should have a thorough check-out, and immunizations, not to mention worming and a snap for feleuk.  Proper vet care is critical when bringing an abandoned animal into the house, with or without other pets.  Lots of the infections they can pick up outdoors, of which parasites are a huge part, is better treated quickly and soon.  Costs, but will save you money in the long run.<br>  Cats truly are, by the way, lactose intolerant, though they do enjoy goats milk, in moderation, with no noticeable problem.  If you want to give him milk, that would be the way I would suggest you go.  You can usually find it tinned, in the baking aisle in your grocery.  Most of them carry it.  And you would also do well to get him on a regular cat food, but don't just blurt him onto it, mix it with what you're giving him now, increasing the ratio of his new while decreasing the old, till you have him totally switched.  This is a good way to go whenever you change foods.  Cats are not very tolerant of a sudden change, which may often result in gastric distress.  Also, make sure he always has a bowl of fresh water available at all times, as they are very susceptible to urinary problems.|`|0wkSf58waa	You need to get this cat to the vet immediately. Also you need to give the cat a dry food diet as well as a wet food diet. Watch how much wet food you are giving the cat because you may also be giving it too much wet food.|`|Bg2Z91Snaa	The cat could have worms or something internal. I would take him to the vet and don't give him anymore table foods. that might upset his stomach even more and I would keep him on a steady diet of regular cat food.|`|BvwJOIkiaa	It sounds like he might have an injury or has worms. PLEASE bring him to a vet!!!|`|EaeEVGZyaa	The cat must be taken to a vet immediately. Vomiting blood is a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Since he was a stray, he could be ill from something prior to your rescuing him.  If you let him roam, he could have eaten a rodent that had recently eaten poison.<br>  Stop the rice.  Cats are obligate carnivores. Carbs are bad for them. Stop the cow's milk; cats lack the enzyme required to properly digest it.<br>  Your cat will hide his pain; it is a survival instinct. Internal bleeding in a human is very painful, so your cat is probably in lots of pain.<br>  Good luck.

cJJY0UtZaa	The lighting you should be using for you iguana is UVB and UVA lighting.  UVA lighting should be coming from a regular incandescent house light bulb and should be it's basking light.  The basking temperature should be between 90 to 92 degrees Fahrenheit.  This is very important to help your iguana digest properly.  I don't recommend heating rocks or anything that heats from below.  Iguanas get burned because their bellies aren't as heat sensitive as the top part of an Iguana.  UVB lighting is supplied from a fluorescent bulb sold at any pet store specifically for reptiles in order to properly synthesize Vitamin-D, which allows them to absorb calcium from their digested foods.

9GMePSopaa	Gerbils, definitely! :D<br>  I've had 3 hamsters before, and of course they're great pets.<br>  But I got my 2 Gerbils in December and they're so much better!<br>  <br>  Gerbils are much more friendly, they have gentle temperaments and are always very alert and want to see what's going on. Whereas hamsters tend to be somewhat aggressive at times. Gerbils aren't the easiest pet to handle, as they're so energentic and active, that they barely stop moving when awake - they'd much rather explore your body than lie on your hand! They should never bite unless you're rough or scare them. I have yet to be bitten by either of mine, although they will nibble at your fingers, simply to see whether you're food :')<br>  <br>  One big plus is that Gerbils are not nocturnal, they go through what is roughly a few hours sleep, a few hours awake and then repeat this cycle. This means that you get to interact much more with your pet without having to wait until it's quite late. (However, gerbils are most active during the early hours of the morning)<br>  <br>  You will have to provide gerbils with a larger, deeper living area, as they're persistent diggers and love to burrow. If you don't provide them with the means to do so, they won't be too happy.<br>  This is my cage/tank - <a href="http://i113.photobucket.com/albums/n226/little_bean_2006/DSC01172.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i113.photobucket.com/albums/n226/...</a><br>  <br>  Something like this is perfect as it facilitates for digging and burrows/sleeping areas in the deep sawdust, with plenty of room for them to climb, use their wheel and feed :)<br>  <br>  You can also use a glass tank with a mesh or cage lid to provide sufficient air supply. A glass tank will be tidier since they cannot spray sawdust over the sides (which they do to me all the time!).<br>  <br>  To keep them entertained, simply give them lots of card, paper and cardboard to chew up and you'll have yourself a happy Gerbil :D<br>  <br>  Remember that you should never buy a lone Gerbil, as they are naturally group animals and will become stressed and unhappy if alone.<br>  <br>  Overall Gerbils are extremely fun pets! Watching them dig frantically and play with eachother is entertaining. Seeing them cuddle up to sleep is very cute too.<br>  <br>  Please feel free to message me if you need any help or advice, and good luck!|`|BaNrweQ4aa	i prefer hamsters so much more to gerbils. i have four gorgeous female hamsters; and they are syrians. i think hamsters look so much cuter than gerbils; because gerbils have long tails, and they are really really fast. hamsters are really friendly once you get to know them; and they only bite when you annoy them. they are easy to look after (as you will have read about) and much easier to handle. they are amazing :) a draught is a cold breeze and pets cannot be near the cold - because they get too cold, and it's not good for them. hamsters and gerbils; and small pets have lots of little rules like this :) they just need to be comfortable and happy :D|`|YRTNpOO7aa	To start with a draught is the cool.<br>  I have two gerbils and they are great, as they are much more active than hamsters.<br>  If you buy a cage with them coloured tubes and a wheel, you will find that they really enjoy the objects.I also add a little saw dust with shredded paper and the tubes from your old toilet/kitchen rolls.They have great little personalities,and they are not nocternal as are girbils.<br>  They live on average for around 2-3years, and are cheap to feed.|`|BySzZAddaa	i would get gerbils because hamsters are nocturnal and don't play with you and don't particularly like being handled and gerbils are really funny to play with and the are'nt nocturnal they are diurnal (awake in the day) and they dont make as much mess as hamsters.|`|r2f9N1BLaa	I prefer hamsters, definitely.

It all depends what you actually want to do with it. A gerbil is more of an animal that can be looked at, atleast wat-leastamster you can have a chance at handling it without actually worrying that it will be too fast. <br>  I have had both pets and i believe that a hamster is the best animal to have a pet.<br>  Oh but if you do decide to get a gerbil, do remember that it cant actually go in a cage as it chews alot, so keep it either in a plastic or glass tank.|`|cYf596WZaa	I have 3 gerbils and i love them to bits!<br>  I find hamsters a bit boring as they are nocternal.

YpEswTQdaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Runt animals often tend to be generally more quite & less active,than 'normal' sized. We had 2 Syrian Hamsters,which were both brothers & of course as most people know Syrians cannot be kept together,as fighting will take place-anyway-. One of the brothers,Kieran,was an average sized Banded Syrian hammy & his brother,solo,was MUCH smaller,he was cute & quiet so we picked him. He never grew very big & was a lot more quiet than his brother. As it turned out,he actually out-lived his brother by 3-4 months or so. Most runt animals will continue to live happily & healthily. As long as Dakota eats & doesn't look 'thin' she's fine. I have a Runty Dwarf Lop rabbit,she is tiny,her ears never flopped too! She looks like a small cross breed,although she isn't. As long they are happy in themselves & are in proportion with their size,no worries.<br>  <br>  If you have any deep concerns about Dakota's health,visit a Vet,otherwise don't worry,just enjoy the time with Dakota. Hope this has been of some use,best wishes.xxx|`|N0n5BWaRaa	Most likely, nothing is wrong.<br>  <br>  When you say that something doesn't seem right, do you mean a behavioral change, or just that you are starting to think the way she acts is weird. It make a big difference.<br>  <br>  Runts tend to be quieter and gentler. If she is getting proper nutrition, and is drink well, she should be fine.|`|BjItitz5aa	Teen-Rabbit & Cavy Lover UK is absolutely right!<br>  <br>  Of course, these runt animals have minds of their own, and if they feel like not in the mood to romp and play, it's perfectly all right. We cannot expect them to perk up every time they see their owners.
tc5A0vKDaa	Nope. You just have to wait.  But, the quick (the pink part) DOES go back, it is just a slow process.

I'm not sure if the quick shrinks I would think it stays the same just like the pink on our fingernails. If you are concerned because the toes are crooked then don't worry.

TkJn9gO0aa	Check your temps....you're husbandry sounds off due to how the snake is reacting. Think, has anything changed in the past couple of weeks? Did the heat pad "burn out" or is it overheating (can happen and malfunction). Have you increased/decreased the temps in your house....in that room?<br>  <br>  The snake's behavior suggests that something is essential is lacking in your setup or that something ill-desired has been introduced. When the snake is active and is constantly "looking" they are not looking for food, they are looking for a way to attain more desirable and better conditions that what they are currently being exposed to. <br>  <br>  Also, it could be simple fasting in the colder months.....it is VERY common for snakes to skip a few meals during these times. Again, VERY common........and natural.<br>  <br>  So, check your temps again, and if they are fine then don't worry. When snakes have choices(temp-wise) then they will make smart decisions. It will decide when it's time to eat again....nobody knows more about snakes than an actual snake.|`|GdZ5ukhlaa	Okay there could be a couple of problems.<br>  <br>  One.  How old is your snake.  Most snakes when they reach sexual maturity they slow down in eating.  Nothing to be worried about if its the maturity part.  He will eat when he is ready.  My sand boa practically starved himself for 2 months before he finally ate again.  <br>  <br>  Two.  Did he use the bathroom?  Your snake should be using the bathroom as much as you are feeding him.  So if you are feeding him once a week he should be using it once a week.  And if he hasn't been.  Just give him a good soak in luke warm water for about 15 minutes and it should break anything up that's wrong with him.<br>  <br>  Three.  When was the last time he shed?  He might be getting ready to go into a shed and has no need to eat right now.<br>  <br>  Four.  Are your temps and humidity right?  If the temp goes down your snake will slow its matabolism.  So you really need to watch things like that.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped|`|VHUDFdZ6aa	The food itself should NOT make any difference - although I do know a Royal Python who will only eat white mice, no brown ones! <br>  My 2-year-old corn snake has always fed fine, no matter what the time of year.<br>  <br>  I'd defo recommend checking your temps. Also is your snake due to shed? They are normally quite grumpy around this time (although mine has *always* fed even once or twice in blue-eye! She's greedy lol)<br>  <br>  How old is your snake? Are you offering mice that are too big? Does your snake prefer wet or dry mice? (if dry, warm in a plastic bag in warm water)<br>  Does your snake strike-feed, or do you just leave the mouse in the viv for it to find? If it doesn't strike-feed I'd recommend trying this. You can dangle the mouse by its tail either by hand (i do this, my snake is roughly 3 feet long), or if your snake is bigger, use tongs! They usually have a very powerful strike!<br>  <br>  Another thing you could try if all else fails - brain the mouse.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :) x|`|JzDIux0daa	i think your right with it not mattering where you bought the mouse.  snakes can go 5-30 days without food.. you just have to be patient.  it will eat eventually.  it sucks having to wait lol.  but its the only thing you can do. just keep trying every other day..  also try offering it different ways.. what i did was take the clamp from my basking light and grab the tail lightly ..and i dangled it until it came out, it took a couple mins to smell around but it came close and BAM .. bye bye frozen hopper lol
uwrzB6Kzaa	1) diy grass livery around the north west is around ￡10-￡15 a week.<br>  i dont know what full grass livery is<br>  part livery varies loads depending on what you are getting for part livery.<br>  full livery is around ￡80 a week around here.<br>  diy livery is on average ￡20 a week.<br>  <br>  i am paying ￡12.50 a week for diy livery. i get a stable, unlimited use of fields in summer and winter and we have a field to  ride in with jumps. my yard has a downside that the grazing is one big 30 acre field so its not good if your horses dont get along or if you have a horse that is hard to catch.<br>  <br>  2) bad points from being at a previous yard was that it had an indoor and outdoor school and the rules were everyone was allowed to book one of them for 1 hour a day. but some people would turn up at 12 and put some of their horses in the indoor school and some in the outdoor school and not get them out until 5pm. the yard owner wouldnt say anything to her and everyone on the yard would be so annoyed because they couldnt use any facilities due to this lady breaking the yard rules. if you are having rules like people need to take it in turns to use your riding field then you need to be prepared to enforce the rules if people take advantage.<br>  <br>  other bad points of yards are where they make you buy the hay, haylage and straw off them when you are on diy livery. i like to shop around and buy my stuff off  whoever gives me the best price for quality. i can get straw for ￡2 a bale but a yard near us that i went to look at has a rule that you have to buy everything on them and they charge ￡4 a bale fo straw. they also over charge on their haylage too so it makes their livery really expensive.<br>  <br>  3) i have never been under contract at any yard ive been at. but if you want to have people their under contract include something about ' you are not liable for any damage or injury caused to property, horses or people while on your premisis. plus  you reccommend that all people are insured incase of injury or damage as you are not liable.'<br>  <br>  you do not want someone injuring themselves and then trying to sue you. if they sign a contract to say they agree you are not liable for any injury or damamge they cant sue you for anything. everywhere covers their backs now. if you go shopping in asda they have signs in the car park saying they are not liable for any damage to vehicles.<br>  <br>  4) i have three horses so i would prefer my own field for my own three horses to go together. i havent got it at my present yard which is a pain. where i am now there is one field for winter which every horse has to go in althogh not many turn out in winter. but in summer there are two fields. one for ponies and one for horses and they all have to get along together.<br>  <br>  5) usually on full livery the livery includes the price of food but it leads to all sorts of problems so if i was you i would charge for it seperate.<br>  <br>  if someone says they want their horse feeding on some really expensive competition mix where as some other person just wants their horse feeding on a general horse and pony mix then you will be out of pocket with the expensive food.<br>  <br>  or if someone wants loads of supplements in their horses feed. i know some people who put about 5 or 6 supplements in each feed so you need to be clear if they are to pay for supplements on top and if you are including feed if you are just including chaff/molichop and horse and pony nuts and other food needs to be bought or something like that.|`|YdJgrgvdaa	1) i pay ￡200 a month for full livery which includes everything i would need.<br>  2) i have no bad things, i prefer smaller yards though<br>  3)what each different type of livery includes and whether you charge extra to turn out/bring in and so on.<br>  4)group definitely because horses are herd animals and need to socialise<br>  5)you provide the food for full livery, for DIY the owner provides the food and may ask you to prepare and give the feed, you may charge extra, it's up to you<br>  6) i'm not sure i've always gone from word of mouth|`|AA12212950	1) I pay about 30 per week for DIY livery but the yard has a big indoor school, an outdoor and fields for riding in as well as hacking so probably something slightly lower would be fair. For full livery I've seen yards around ￡70.<br>  2) Good aspects, approachable and helpful owners. Also although I'm DIY I can ask for my horse to be turned out or brought in or they will look after him for a day. <br>  Bad aspects: getting charged for everything. i.e. every time you get a haynet, use the school etc. Also price increases just as you're going into winter.<br>  3) Horses must be vaccinated, passported. Notice period required on both sides.<br>  4) I like group turnout and my horse certainly seems to prefer it as he loves playing with his friends. They are herd animals so its more natural for them to be out with others.<br>  5) A lot of yards have certain feeds i.e a chaff, cereal mix etc but if you want something special for your horse you provide it yourself|`|DNiq1Vcjaa	1) Grass Livery ￡15 approx<br>  DIY ￡20-25<br>  Part ￡60-70<br>  Full ￡70-80.... I would expect to pay more if you had a school/menage<br>  <br>  2) Bad aspects when there is one rule for one person and another for someone else. Good aspects are all year turnout,flexible hours of access to the yard and welfare of horses as top priority.<br>  <br>  3) Depends which livery you have,but you need to consider being present with farrier, tooth man and back man, turn out, mucking out, picking feet out, grooming, tack cleaning, feeding and feed etc<br>  <br>  4) I prefer group turnout cos horses are herd animals but my present horse rips rugs so he needs individual turnout so a flexible attitude is best.<br>  <br>  5) You provide the food and they provide any supplements...|`|zzsZ3jEhaa	1) How much, reasonably, would you pay for livery? (Either each or just the kind your using at the moment)<br>  Full Livery I've seen is about ￡60-￡80, but that often includes farriery.<br>  We currently have DIY Grass livery at about ￡20 a week.<br>  <br>  2) What's the good and bad aspects of the yards you've been at? So I can either use them or avoid them!<br>  I know at our yard, we get moved about a lot, which gets quite annoying, and also prioritizing certain people over others has happened a few times, but generally, it's fine.<br>  <br>  3) What should be included in the contract?<br>  A certain amount of weeks notice as to when they intend on leaving perhaps?<br>  <br>  4) I am able to section off the field so each horse has it's own little area and will be asking owners what they would prefer - however do you prefer individual turn out or group?<br>  I prefer individual turn out with my horse, as it's easier to ride out alone, but then you can ride out in a group as well, whereas group turnout often results in the horse being reluctant to leave, or plays up<br>  .<br>  5) For full livery I will be feeding each horse what the owner requests - who provides the food? Me or them?<br>  Generally, they provide the food/pay you to get it. At another yard in my village, you just drop a bag of food of to them, but I mean, you may prefer to buy it with what you buy.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps, I may only be 16, but I've had horses since I was born, and so has my mother!
fi85yw8Kaa	Try washing your hands very thoroughly. Then put a small piece of feed on your hand away from your fingertips.

17ovKbITaa	This is called porphyrin, a substance that is produce by the Harderian gland. It looks like blood, however it is only red because of the chemical make up of the porphyrin. It can sometimes indicate stress or sickness, if you are concerned, please visit your vet.<br>  <br>  I would say from the description of the swelling, this would indicate an eye infection, this can be treated with eye drops.

2c726775df1bee382684b2b2b4d3e248aa	Yes they are, as long as you teach the children how to behave around the dog - no pulling of whiskers, tails etc. or jumping on the dog, or hugging it etc. Most important, never leave the children alone with any dog and get it trained to be obedient as soon as you can.  Siberian Huskies are large, boisterous dogs and need good discipline, but they are fiercely loyal to their family.  They also need a very lot of exercise, so hope you have lots of time for this.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	U have some good answers here. Pay attention to them. Huskies do need training. They are roamers, so need good fences. They are in the working group, so need "jobs" to do. Prepare to go to dog school, and go sledding or ski-jouring with them in the winter. Summertime can be back packing and swimming. For fall season get a cart and train to harness. The kids will  love it. The carts can be gotten from a goat supply site, or find someone who makes them for Newfies or Saints.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Gorgeous dogs and yes, good with people and children if trained properly (both kid and dog, you know!)

But most dogs are that way. Make sure you really research this breed because they aren't for everyone. They need plenty of exercise and need to be socialized with smaller dogs early on if you plan on taking them to dog parks where all sizes of dogs are around.

But I am a groomer, and I do encounter them very often. I think all dogs have a great potential to be good companions if they are raised well in a good household.

They're howling is very unique, some find it adorable, I on the other hand find it somewhat irritating. But when they are around me I am also bathing, blow drying, and trimming their nails, which most dogs do not like. There for they howl non-stop in my ear. Getting a dog at a very young age is a good idea.

I have not heard of a magnetic hair remover, if you are referring to the Furminator, it's great. You can see demonstrations of this on the Internet. This is fantastic for grooming and it will eventually reduce the hairs which float around your house and get onto your clothes.<br>  <br>  Although I use a Furminator, I still need to use a rough backed sponge to get the hairs off my clothes. I buy these sponges at supermarkets, they are round,one side is rough and the other side is just a synthetic sponge. I use them in the shower, then save them to use on my clothes. I put vinegar on the rough side of the sponge and the hairs come off like magic.<br>  <br>  If there is a magnetic dog hair remover that you know about, please let us all in on this. I doubt that this will be better than the Furminator.|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	I have found that even with all of the new inventions the best thing to get hairs off of clothes is still a stiff bristled brush.

Yes, it works, but if you have a dog more than 20 pounds you will be at it for hours a couple times a week. What I do, is i shave my dog between seasons so I can get rid of all the loose hair. Then when it grows back in a month or two, it's much MUCH less shedding.
eyKx05LKaa	Shay again, stop answering questions about betta's.  This the second time you have given bad information about Betta's - it's so annoying.  YOU CANNOT PUT MALE BETTA'S WITH FEMALES.  THEY WILL KILL EACH OTHER.  You can only put them together for a short while for breeding.  You can however, put them in with other fish; cory's, tetras (without long fins), minnows, danios, hatchets, ghost shrimp and dwarf african frogs are some things you can put in with them.

18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	By 'house bred' I assume you mean Back Yard Breeder.  DO NOT BUY FROM A BYBer if you want a quality pup.  Find a reputable breeder that breeds for show & get one of their pet quality dogs.  The ones that just don't have what it takes to be in a show ring.  The have you sign a contract that the pup will be spayed/neutered.  That is the best way to go.  You get a quality dog without paying the high price for one.  Besides people should not breed their pets.  Most do not have the knowledge they need to be able to better the breed.<br>  <br>  Don't buy this pup.  Search for a competent breeder & buy from there.|`|csDhZDvraa	If you cannot tell if it is purebred or not then you shouldnt be buying from this breeder. <br>  <br>  Consider adopting a poodle puppy from a Poodle rescue, you save a life and are not supporting bad breeders when you adopt from a rescue!<br>  <br>  BTW he does not look purebred to me, to thick boned to be poodle.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petfinder.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com</a> <---------look up poodles in need of homes where you are!|`|bIaywrBCaa	probably one of the oodle doodle mutts.

Do a little reading on this. Dog genetics are fascinating. There is even a book written just on coat color inheritance in dogs.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	From the background it appears as if this is a pet store.  Is it.  If so do not purchase.  It is from a puppy mill no matter what they say.  And by purchasing it you would be supporting the puppy mills.<br>  If there is no guarantee, or the parents health tested, do not buy.  But if they can't even prove if it is purebred by it's AKC paper's If in US or CanKC if in Canada or KC papers if in UK.  Then you can bet the parents were not health tested.  <br>  If they were health tested the breeder would be more than happy to show you the proof. <br>  This puppy does not look pureberd.  If it is it is dreadfully mismarked.  <br>  You should not pay anything more than what it's shots cost.  Unless it is a rescue then add a donation to the rescue to help other dogs.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	honestly to me s/he doesn't look purebred poodle.  At this age it is hard to tell but the hair is too straight & the features aren't quite right. They could be just poor quality but either way I wouldn't be buying if I wanted a poodle pup.  You get what you pay for - buying from a reputable breeder is always going to cost more but you know better what you are getting.|`|3hBQz33Yaa	Is this a website selling dogs?

f8t4FQZ5aa	The vermiculite should be damp enough to clump together when squeezed but not so damp as to drip water. 86F is a perfect temp.<br>  if you use a clear egg box (Rubbermaid style) you can easily monitor the humidity. If you see condensation up  to 3/4 on the sides it is fine. Excessive humidity will cause condensation on the upper edges and the lid. carefully remove condensation from the lid, you don't want to drop water directly onto the eggs. When done properly this method seldom, if ever requires additional moisture to be added to the box.<br>  Good Luck<br>  <a href="http://www.westcoastdragons.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.westcoastdragons.com</a>|`|aQCTR0Heaa	hi my brother's lizard just give birth too.<br>  <br>  he water's them 3 times a day. but don't get the eggs wet. just keep them most<br>  <br>  its our first time to|`|QgEqGDjZaa	are bearded dragons vegaterians

V8rV38yfaa	Depends from breed to breed. Or it may have eaten what you give your pup so it must have got sick.<br>  <br>  Anyways a visit to the vet will let you know better of what has happened.|`|1H0vYaJxaa	The great thing about having cats and dogs are that their diseases are not contiguous. So I would not worry about the puppy getting the cat sick. <br>  It seems as if the cat is just a bit jealous. Keep an eye on your cat and make sure that the vomit does not have blood in it. Also when my aunt got a new cat her older one started peeing on everything. It is just a stress thing. <br>  I would make sure that the cats food is not near the dogs and that they have their own water. Try to keep in mind that the cat was there first and treat her like that. <br>  <br>  (If you cat is vomiting up yellow looking stuff then that is bile and then that means the puppy got in her food and the cat is just hungry.)|`|6EP7ILr3aa	Check she isn't eating your puppies food. My cat steals food from my dog and the next day throws up. Also I would check your puppy has had all its injections or needs them, could have picked up a disease and is carrying it on its coat. Take your puppie to the vet and get it checked over.  <br>  Congratulations on your new Puppy!!!
hEXb1unraa	You are supposed to use standing wraps and nobow pads when you want to wrap a shipping wrap....I buy 14 in pads for the front and 16 in for the rear legs. The wraps you are describing sound like a polo they are a little bit stretchy and are mostly used to wrap a figure eight exercise wrap when working a horse....Me personally would never use a stretchy wrap for a standing wrap....standing wraps have no stretch.....its too easy to wrap a leg too tight and bow a tendon....they are really old wraps because of the tie on them, most today have velcro. A set of 4 standing wraps should be like 15 bucks at a tack store.....dont take a chance on hurting your horses legs with improper wraps. Nobow pads are a little bit more expensive but are well worth it.|`|yNHBBQ6faa	well, actually you shouldn't use elastic bandages on the tail, they cut off circulation and could lead to serious damage........|`|bQoQueCHaa	If the elastic material stops the legs from breathing, do NOT put them on without padding underneath.

O4jGlC2caa	I think you need to hold off.  Have to say as a taxpayer, you're upsetting me here.  You said you are on unemployment.  That means the money taken from MY paycheck is going to help you.  Then you tell me that a.) you want to go on a trip and b.) you take your current dog to a groomer (perhaps you should learn to brush and trim your dog at home during these hard times), and c.) you want to get an additional dog meaning additional dog food.  That's a triple slap to the face.<br>  <br>  Cancel the trip, hold off on dog number 2, and take care of business at home.  Could be your boyfriend isn't as savvy with the account as you think, and you are about to put yourself further in the hole.  Some people think everything will be fine.  They can keep spending as they usually do.  You are on unemployment though.  Instead of taking trips, you should be constantly looking for new jobs.<br>  <br>  Edited:<br>  I read exactly what you typed.  You need to clarify details the first time around.  <br>  <br>  "In the long run goign out on a trip will be a hassle because my parents don't like dogs and will never take care of them for me and friends i do not have except for the people upstairs." <br>  You were at least thinking about going on a trip.  Somehow it crossed your mind.<br>  <br>  "... i got an excellent groomer..."<br>  Says nothing about how the groomer JUST does nails and anal glands.<br>  <br>  "Groomer doesn't just cut and wash? I can do that..."<br>  But do you?  Or do you still take your dog for the works at the groomer despite the limited income?<br>  "They als express anal glands and cut nails which i refuse to do don't want to hurt the dog"<br>  I have a loved one who is a groomer, and she refuses to do anal gland expressing.  That is actually something your vet should be doing.  Your groomer could make an anal gland problem worse.<br>  <br>  It is rude to call someone ignorant... especially when you yourself are mainly basing this dog purchase on the fact that your BOYFRIEND said everything will be OK money-wise.  I play an active role when it comes to knowing where every penny of my money goes.|`|bIaywrBCaa	it would probably be better to wait until you find another job before getting another dog.

A hat that matches you chaps and shirt color with a squared brim and a saddle pad that matches your outfit your tack should be a light oiled leather with tons of silver, depending on the show you may need gloves but they aren't required in most western classes, you should go to a show and observe the styles.|`|1c6TmvrZaa	I like to match my shirt with my horse's show saddle pad.
