AA11452852	You might want to talk with Dr. Craig Dubois of the Pain Evaluation and Treatment Center.    The Pain Evaluation & Treatment Center  7307 Creekbluff Drive  Austin, TX  Phone: 512-346-6969   http://www.paineval.net/    I would recommend the Advanced Pain Care, because many people have told me good things about it.  But I have also heard that you may not get the same doctor each time, which I think is a problem.  Still it may be worth checking out.    Advanced Pain Care  Austin Center Blvd. Suite 205   Austin,TX  Phone: (512) 349-9100  http://www.austinpaindoctor.com/    Good luck!!|`|PvwcZqb6aa	Dr Craig Dubois is best there is-he helped me so much!! seen him for years

Fo9ADQLBaa	Now wait just a minute here!  80???  They are a bit much even here.  I can buy a brand new comforter at Big Lots, cheaper than I can a used one at Am vets and Goodwill.  The cars parked in the parking lot are Mercedes, Lexus and Cadillacs.  Their owners are bargain hunters that buy them cheap and resell them at their antique stores, for a fortune.  This is what has driven up the prices around here.  It is not for the unfortunate anymore.|`|jvFhoov7aa	yeah i dont know it doesnt seem right   i think that they just think people will be like oh well the economys bad so i guess they have to up there prices but its just a way for more money i think.|`|t3A9qpQIaa	I don't know but I'm sorry to hear that.|`|wJhZbUKtaa	NOt sure where you are but the one by my house hasn't gone up or down.|`|AA11993919	I agree. It seems like everything is going up.|`|n081l915aa	The problem with vintage and thrift stores in an economic downturn is a problem of supply. Fewer people are donating things because they think they'll need them, and since the stores are getting less merchandise, they have to make ends meet by raising prices.|`|8Y583Fluaa	i know...jeans are cheaper in the dollar store than the used jeans at them places
kTYw3LgYaa	Try calling in your favorite radio station.  Tell them you need to do a job shadow for school, chances are they'll let you do it. I did it in High School and they hooked me up with free t-shirts, cds, and even let me go on air. It was a really great experience!|`|GhkbDqe1aa	Hi!  I know sounds weird, but it is true!  Yesterday found http://miramarbeach.ws They pay for people you refer.  I went to bed, and got 2 people while sleeping. Try this as additional money, while looking for real job!

bru2xnlRaa	Try contacting these people :     California DMV Registration Renewal Services in Orange County and Los Angeles    Provide auto registration and insurance services to the public. ...   We can help answer and solve your California vehicle registration matters. ...    www.mvr-services.com|`|e61a72ed022789b06c8dae082a26fcd8aa	AAA should be open on Saturdays (at least they used to be).  They handle a limited amount of DMV services.|`|943ad7d1a8aed2bd9d670c9644993c66aa	California DMV offices are no longer open on Saturdays due to the budget crisis.      It has been almost 90 days.  Shwarzenegger has been trying to get the Legislature to finally act, but those bozos truly are playing party politics.
A3I4UJQyaa	I ship a lot through UPS for my online business and experienced a similar problem once. They told me that sometimes when there are delivery exceptions/delays, it may show the destination city (Cincinnati) in their tracking system although it is probably hung up somewhere in route.      If you have the tracking number I would give them a call at 800-PICK UPS.  Sometimes they can give you more detailed information then what is available through online tracking.     Unfortunately, until they make a delivery attempt at your address and leave an info notice, you cannot make arrangements to pick it up from them. Also, chances are you will have to pick your package up from their nearest customer facility and not the nearest UPS store.  But they can tell you where that is when you call them.    Good luck!!!
QCkanmR9aa	Tell her to email me i have some.
4f6e1488eea68ccac928d6e0d6f6e5caaa	1.  Store credit to my knowledge works exactly the same as a gift card.  The main difference is for accounting purposes.    2. There method for Home Depot to track the owner of a gift card or store credit.    3.  The thing you read about the check is true, but store credit can also be given out for items without a receipt.  It is our way of giving "cash" back to people without being overly exploited.    My concern with that card is to make sure there is a 500 dollar balance on it.|`|jgWLQU3Gaa	A store credit is given when someone returns something without a receipt. It can be used just like a gift card. As far as your concern about fraud, that is something you have to go with your gut feeling.
BEyqvqkZaa	Unfortunately, it is not enough.     To live in California in general you would have to be making at least in the $80,000-$90,000 range. Needless to say, living in Los Angeles would be quite expensive and simple necessities are overpriced do to the "quality" of the area.    With $56,000 as a yearly income, you could live a somewhat decent living in a city like Dallas but it would not suffice in Los Angeles.    As a tip, consider smaller cities or the suburbs and manage your expenses well.|`|84Z0QS2zaa	Well, one person's definition of decent wouldn't fit another persons, but I know people who live here on half that much who are doing alright. They live in decent apartments in decent neighborhoods, dine out, go to shows, take vacations.     If you're talking about just one person and you don't have expensive tastes and have to live in a posh place you should be fine. Many, many people here live on much much less and are glad to be here. Even some families have no more than that and they aren't living in hovels and eating out of garbage cans.    If you really need, or want, to live here you'll be fine. It seems like too many people here want to make the Los Angeles area sound so ultra expensive and exclusive almost. Why, does it make them feel superior somehow?|`|5aKUV5afaa	No. I live in Indiana and won't or can't accept less then 70.  But with today's economy I guess you have to do what you have to do.|`|sTYoR9F0aa	of course you can survive with that a year :D use it sparingly and make extra by stripping!|`|7X0xe8oraa	Yes you can. You won't be living in Beverly Hills but I know people that make less than that and have a decent apartment and are able to do stuff for fun. You will be fine.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Yes it's enough to live on. I lived there for many years and I know.  You might not be able to live in the Hollywood Hills and shop on Rodeo Drive but you will do fine.  The guy from Dallas doesn't know what he's talking about.
BnetTGCkaa	Which Rochester?  There is a Rochester in New York, Minnesota, and Michigan, that I know of.
