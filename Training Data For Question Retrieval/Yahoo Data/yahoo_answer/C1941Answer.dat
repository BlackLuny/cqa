imaeeL9Naa	Nice questions!    You need to read up on it.    www.xbox-scene.com  there are tutorials and many many helpful people on the forums.      You'll need to open up your xbox:  http://llamma.com/xbox360/repair/Xbox-36...    You'll need to know what dvd drive you have:  http://llamma.com/xbox360/Xbox_360_DVD_D...    Yes you can mess up something and then pretty much brick your dvd drive making it very difficult to make a new one work.      I'd get a strong foothold into the modding world starting with an original xbox, because they are relatively inexpensive and will provide you with a good understanding of modding.  But if your feeling brave go for it.    ~ Shoe
VQdqFT5Uaa	Yes, I have .avi files on my portable hard drive and I just plug it into any of the USB ports, then when I go under videos I see it listed under portable devices.  At that point, you just need to navigate to the correct folder and you should be able to start the videos you want.  I am not sure about game data though, I have never tried that because I have lots of room on my Xbox hard drive.

ilScrvPEaa	1). Hard drives marking is approximate. It's easier for manufacturers to mark HDD as 80GB, than 74GB. That's a common practice.  2). PS3's OS (operating system) system files take up some space too.|`|aROiy2Gnaa	because u have all the system settings and everyrthing else on it u should of got a 80 gig one.|`|1HtTxOOQaa	The space used is kept for the OS, drivers which make games run on it, the blu-ray drivers, wifi drivers.... It's normal. Every thing which has an OS (in this case the PS3 has it's XMB(Home screen)) consumes space. 6-7 GB is taken by the PS3.|`|iB9ROoOqaa	don't worry .. it's normal . every hdd or memory stick you use is like that.   the system or the console itself takes out several GB or MB from the hdd for system. so don't worry about it|`|m31vJe5xaa	Yeah, this happens with any harddrive on any computer system. The OS will take a few gb's to save system settings and other stuff like that, it happens when the drive is formatted. My laptop has an 80gb hdd and only 65 was available to me, my desktop has a 640gb and only 620 is available lol. It's normal, nothing you can do to change it.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Same with me, i have an 80GB and it only had 74GB. Its only because all of the original software are installed during manufacturing|`|wmT15caAaa	systems and stuff settings ect to save...same for me instead of 80 i have 74
wL8n46STaa	you can either go to http://www.esnips.com   OR http://www.jamglue.com    im nawt assuring you the songs will be there but they're pretty good websites...   and you need to make an account on each if u want songs...   it's free and safe so don't worry about anything...|`|PVkPS17Qaa	You can try this site:  http://www.mp3search.mobi/    Or you can use free file sharing programs like:  limewire, frostwire, or bearshare|`|BiynTKu9aa	You could try emusic.com or napster.com they usually have free downloads if you sign up for their services as long as you cancel you won't be charged. The truth is its very hard to get free music these days. You just got to look around and maybe you'll get luck. So, good luck!|`|DwrLT9CNaa	i tunes. where else?|`|HeMhMQmEaa	Well, you really can't get free music, 100% legally, which is unfornuate for us, but not for the music industry lol. I would reccomend downloading frostwire, for PC or Mac. Frostwire itself isn't illegal, but some of the content is. iTunes has illiminated all digital rights managment on songs, so you can't be sued if you share, or have a shared song. Don't worry, just download frostwire. +Frostwire is virus FREE! :)

1HtTxOOQaa	Why not just replace the current drive? The prices of drives are coming down every month and you can always replace the PS3 internal drive and back it up on the new drive.  1.No I don't think so(cause i use a 16GB USB and I don't get an option to save the game there). But you can do this manually by just pressing triangle on the saved data utility.  2. Again follow the above procedure. The saved games hardly measure more than 150-300 KB and so why not just save it on the original drive.  3.Just copy the data to the drive by pressing triangle (again 1st step) and then delete the data from original drive.    See the below link to know how to make an external drive work.|`|iB9ROoOqaa	i think you must have hard drive inside the ps3 to save them. and yeah, you can save the game in your external hard drive and also in your USB flash memory if you have one. but the store is really pain in the neck you must have the hard drive in ur ps3 to download the games only. but themes, pics..etc it's not problem .     here's how you can install a hard drive in ur ps3 i hope it helps     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNSytaL9h...
df8a2cde02233e03261e516e3faddd74aa	I suggest go for it coz Polaroid is one of the masters in cams & 4898 is a throw away price but still check with kodak & olympus coz these cams also are cheaper these days...who knows u might get a better deal.|`|c3DqvgE4aa	its canon
9mTctb7jaa	If the tapes play from the camcorder, then use the av out cable from the camcorder to make your DVD.  Playing a tape back in the same deck that recorded it always gives the best results.  There can be a lot of reasons for the problem and none easy to fix. Additionally this model camera can record tapes in SuperVHS which do not play back in regular VCRs. These small cameras used a special tiny record head that used a 3/4 tape wrap and it could be it is recording a track that is slightly askew from normal but will playback its own tape.|`|42tTsVuxaa	I know this isn't an answer to why it wont play.    There are many companies that will convert from almost any format to any format, that means you could get them put onto an external drive so that you can edit them or just simply put them onto dvd. normally only a few $ per tape than your videos of your children will be safe.     Good luck    Just thought pinnacle make an adaptor that converts analogue video to digital, so that you can edit it on your computer. they are not expensive    RR
O8qdCBzLaa	No, playing scratched DVDs or CDs will not affect the laser or lens in the least. The laser shines down onto the disc and the reflections are detected. If the spot on the disc is flat, the lens detects the light reflecting back and this is a digital 1 in the bit stream. If the spot on the disc is at an angle, the light is reflected away from the lens and this is a digital 0. The 1s and 0s then make up the digital audio or video signal that is decoded for you to listen to or watch.    If there are scratches on the disc, the light isn't reflected when it's supposed to be. This causes errors in the digital bit stream. And, since the decoder can't decipher the signal correctly, you get skipping of the audio or video signal.    But, scratches on a disc don't cause any damage or anything to the lens. It just prevents that particular disc from being played properly.|`|c3DqvgE4aa	No i have try.|`|5r3DHtsfaa	yes it is possible that the scratched CD / DVD might damage the laser or lens of the DVD player !
475c01dc76b1f175b986a137414d9e50aa	You need a USB audio interface - you cannot connect mics to a MIDI interface.    Another option would be to get a 4 or more channel audio mixer and then send the mixed output of that to your audio interface for recording.    http://www.zzounds.com/cat--USB-Audio-In...    http://www.zzounds.com/item--BEHXENYX120...

cuR7T3praa	Apparently the police would have been to your home by now.  Did you do it to someone you know and they knew it was you?  You could call them back and apologize to them if you think they would take your call otherwise just don't do anything  like that again.   I really do not thing you would be arrested for doing it|`|Z7ZE1lAJaa	You are an idiot for making the call Now go pick up trash off the streets for 2 hours|`|AFJ07ArNaa	don't worry, no one in their right mind would call the cops over a prank call.    the police would have too much paperwork and they have more pressing issues to be getting on with
GhetCx0iaa	LOL  what|`|khFGiA1iaa	For every stupid person on here that has said what kind of ipod... re-read the question. IT'S AN IPOD NANO!!!! Anything could be wrong. Look to see if your hold button is on (found on the top of the ipod). If it is, switch it off and try it then. If it's not, then try holding down the middle button (not on the scroll) and the top button on the scroll (the menu button). That's all I can really give you b/c you didn't give much detail.|`|ZdZlNAa2aa	You really need more detail in this question.

3TqPF1zMaa	Neither is better. They are both excellent cameras made by excellent companies and equally capable of making excellent pictures in the hands of a good photographer.    What matters is which one do you most like to use? Which one most works the way you like to work? Which one most makes you want to run home with it and make thousands of pictures?    You need to go to a good camera store and try each one of them in your hands. Spec sheets and Internet reviews can't do this for you.    Disclosure: I am the owner of http://www.lenslenders.com in Canada.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	I love Nikon and I would go with D90  http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001E...|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	here is a comparison review. i use canon, but nikon is good too. it's more about the photographer.  http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/print.as...|`|7SXA5dhDaa	The Nikon D90 is the newer of the two.  Since they are both excellent cameras, I would go with the newer technology.  The Nikon throws in an HD video mode also.  I admit to being biased, I bought the D90 just a few months ago.
YHS3AU0vaa	I came across such problem before. All you need is to use an iPod transfer program to help you. I personally used Movavi iCopy - An indispensable addition to your iPod media library http://gutensoft.com/Utilities/Movavi-iC...    It will help you:   Transfer music and video from iPod to iTunes   Secure your iPod media content by copying it to your PC   Backup iPod music, podcasts, and videos in three simple steps   Move media content between multiple iPods   Enjoy your media files on any PC at work or at home   Work with all iPod models   Get all your iPod files automatically organized by playlists   Access all this functionality through an intuitive, straightforward interface    You can free download it to have a try. Best luck!|`|dvfeBZtZaa	Does your new PC have different music than what is on your iPod?  If so, you will lose the music that the new iTunes doesn't have.  the only way you wont lose music is to get all your old music onto the new pc and then plug it in and click ok.  You won't lose anything that way.  If you don't have the same music it will wipe the whole library on your iPod and just put on the new stuff.|`|btHait6kaa	press ok it wont delete your music|`|maqOdH9Paa	dont sync, then click the iPod tab on the let side above your playlists. then on the made iPod screen (in iTunes), scroll down slightly and check the box that says MANUALLY MANAGE MUSIC.  this will allow you to add one song at a time, and not delete the old stuff|`|rWPBQZoWaa	well u would have to get all of ur old music onto the new ITunes. Good Luck!!!!!!!!!!!
AA11525080	It needs to be reset.hold the home and off button until it turns off.|`|RtIbnlcpaa	This is a very common question. Probably the wifi networks you were trying to connect with weren't actually connected to the internet therefore you wont be able to either, or the conncetion wasnt as strong as it said it was or something was interfeering with the connection you were trying to connect with. I suggest you buy a wireless router for your house so your conncetion will always have a strong connection and you will always be connected to the internet

Wsx8Ama6aa	We should be seeing one by March or April.  But nothing at all is a 100% confirmed.  If you find any of those pictures out there right now, its probably just a photoshopped.  I want one too but i don't trust anything until its confirmed by tmobile. So yeah i would suggest just waiting it out :) wont be too long
khFGiA1iaa	Well, if it won't respond to resetting it, maybe you should go to where you bought it (Wal-Mart, Toys R Us, Radio Shack, etc.). Maybe your battery is dieing and you should leave it plugged in for a few days. You could also go to apple.com and go to their support page. When you buy your Ipod, you get a warranty on it, so depending on how long ago you got your Ipod, you can exchange it for a new one or your money back. Good luck!|`|HeMhMQmEaa	WHAT KIND OF IPOD IS IT????????????????????

s23IU7eKaa	It depends all on ur needs... do u want a multi media device along with something to play games? then its ps3... its perfect for easily viewing your pictures, videos, and listening to music. the storage can be easily updated.. and its within the warrenty, and its actually encouraged by sony.. you can upgrade it to a 2.5" SATA 320GB drive for about 50.. search www.play.com.     The xbox 360 is with out a doubt the leader in online gaming...  with achievements(trophies in ps3) and a much more better service. but remember... that to upgrade ur xbox to have roughly the same features as the ps3, it will cost you the same if not more than the ps3... accesories such as a wireless adapter, rechargeable pack for the controllers.|`|qog4MvbOaa	I'll just show you the facts:   - Ps3 is generally more expensive than the 360  - Ps3 comes with a built in next-gen disc player, unlike 360. Making it easier to watch your favorite HD movies.  - 360 has a larger selection of games than the Ps3.  - 360 has a larger amount of games rated from 70-100% on metacritic.com by quite a bit. Basically meaning according to the average gaming critic there are more quality games on Xbox 360 than Ps3. Or Wii for that matter. Mainly because of the one year head start.  - Ps3's online is completely free, while on 360 if you want to actually play games online you'll have to pay a subscription fee.  - Ps3 has Wi-Fi built in, while on 360 you'll have to buy an add-on. so if you're planning on playing online via wireless, that's something to consider.    It's fairly equal in my opinion. 360 probably squeezes it out because of the games, but there's a fair chance lots of people with disagree with me. Also, you should have a look at the upcoming games on both consoles. I'll list some games for each console below. Of course there's also alot of multiplats they both share as well:  360-   Alan Wake (also on PC)   Halo Wars  Halo 3: ODST (Expansion pack)   GTA 4: The Lost & The Damned (Expansion Pack)  3 Pieces of Fallout 3 DLC (Operation Anchorage, The Pitt & Broken Sword. Also on PC)   Halo Wars  Splinter Cell: Conviction (Also on PC)  Ninja Blade  Ninety-Nine Nights 2  All Points Bulletin (Also on PC)  Star Ocean 4  Race PRO  Champions Online (Also on PC)  Huxley (Also on PC)    Ps3-  God of War 3  Final Fantasy 13: Versus  Uncharted 2  Gran Turismo 5  Heavy Rain  inFamous  Killzone 2  MAG  Quantum Theory  White Knight Chronicles  Yakuza 3  The Agency (Also on PC)  DC Universe Online (Also on PC)|`|aROiy2Gnaa	dont get a red ring of death washing machine which is louder then a jumbo jet crashing into a bomb factory.     get a ps3|`|eexxVMzSaa	Xbox 360, blue ray is an unfinished technology so you'll most likely end up buying a propper blue ray player in the future.|`|1HtTxOOQaa	PS3 is better cause there are no reliability issues and also, PS3 has great upcoming games like Killzone 2(best looking game on a console), God Of War 3, GT5, Infamous, Quantum Theory, Heavy Rain, Uncharted 2.... whereas 360 only has Halo to look forward to this year.     Also, Killzone 2 is reviewed by many big sites and has yet to score below 9. Reviewers(from IGN and gamespot) have rated the game even higher than COD4 and Bioshock which were probably best FPS titles till date (please don't say where Halo is cause in two word HALO SUCKS!!!). and also, the game has near equivalent graphics to Crysis on PC, a feat which is impossible to achieve on a 360 (Gears Of War 2 when compared to KZ2 in terms of graphics looks rubbish). This shows how future games on the PS3 will look like.|`|pl2SocVKaa	ps3|`|VcNHahtgaa	Don't listen to people who say "Xbox is cheaper" because it is not true. You have to buy SO MANY add-ons. I had a talk with my friend who had a 360 and he agreed with me that the add ons will consist the same price of a PS3. The add ons are must buys also for it to function.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  PROS:  PS3 -  1. Free Online, keeps getting better. Soon to match Xbox Live.  2. Full 1080p resolution  3. Built In Blu Ray  4. Cheaper HardDrives to Add [320GB for $80]  5. Comes with a USB device to charge your Controller.  6. Internet Browser  7. Home and Life have a lot of potential to get better, FREE also.  8. Browse Youtube with "TV" option. [Only Wii + PS3 have this]  9. Might make a deal with Blockbuster to make something similar to Netflix with 360.  10. 0.2% chance of failing. Most consumer products have a 2% fail rate.    Xbox360-  1. Netflix.  2. 3 year warranty    CONS:  PS3 -  1. New PS3's can't play PS2 games  2. 1 year warranty  3. Cost $150 to fix it if passed your 1 year warranty.      Xbox360 -  1. 33% fail rate meaning you can't play it and if you want to fix it you have to send it to microsoft for them to fix it and you will get it back approx. 3 WEEKS and has 33% of it failing again [PS3 has 0.2%]  2. Pay for online gaming $50 a year  3. Have to buy many add ons  4. Buy a recharger for controllers.  5. Cost more for HardDrive [60GB $100]  6. Buy Wifi [$100]    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    If you buy the $199 Xbox 360, you will HAVE to buy the Hard drive which costs $100 which will be equal to the $299 one. If you want to play online also, you have to buy a Wifi Adapter for $100. After that, you have to buy a recharger for your controller which costs about $30-40 for only 1 controller.     Xbox 360 also had this thing called "RROD" which will break your Xbox 360 and you have to send it to Microsoft for them to fix it. It takes about 3-4 weeks for them to fix it. The RROD happens in about 33% of all 360's and it happens from overheating, which means playing it too long. The PS3 only had 0.2% chance of breaking.|`|uu22BItnaa	PS3 if u want to watch blu ray and classics from ps2|`|H6D6jlKGaa	Xbox 360 is wayy better in my opinion!!

DU2THcAdaa	A friend warned me that LG phones weren't great, but when the LG Viewty came out I had to get one. What a mistake, it was rubbish. LG offered no support for software/firmware issues, particularly with the poor 5MP camera. After 7 months of problems (terrible battery life, unexpected shut downs, touch screen freezes) Virgin Mobile (my UK provider at the time) finally agreed to replace it. Interestingly, they offered me a Sony Ericsson c902 because they were no longer 'carrying' the Viewty. A phone that's not even a year old and it's been discontinued? Not a good sign!  So, I'd stay clear of LG in the future, but in the meantime you should take up these issues/problems with your provider. It wouldn't do any harm to ask for a replacement, or a handset from an alternative brand.|`|OtYAkRrRaa	I notice that sometimes my phone doesn't ring and goes straight to voice mail. It shows a missed call. The worst part about it is when I try to talk to someone they are really hard to hear. It has nothing to do with the volume. It is really loud. Over modulated.

I owned so many. Typical. Don't trust LG phones. @.@|`|QxC8xRgWaa	My chocolate has done this. 5 times. It is typical of LG phones, they have a particularly strong vibrate. If verizon or whatever your carrier is replaces the phone, then I would suggest: Firstly, only charge your phone when it's OFF. NEVER text with it plugged in, and be very gentle when plugging it in. Oh, and to prolong your battery life, only charge your LG when it is all the way dead. These things are annoying to do, but they help. :)
J3kfQtViaa	The ps3 is still trying to use hdmi when you moved it to the other tv.  When you hook it up to the other tv, and it goes into standby, hold the power button for 5 seconds.  This should set it up to work automatically on the new cable.    This is done manually in video settings on the ps3.    What you could also do is go to video settings, before u change tv's, and set the video output to what it needs to be for the other tv.  If you do this though you will lose picture and wont be able to shut it down with the controller.  well you'd have to memorize how to shut it down /w the controller. lol.|`|DIxbib1paa	When you have it connected with your hdmi cable, plug in your scart cable in ALSO, now change the connection setting back to scart it will work on ya standard tv now.|`|1WgOj89kaa	use your ps2 cable and it will work on any TV, thats what i did

8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	A benefit of HDMI is audio and video all in one cable.  Pass through isn't necessarily bad, but considering there is no processing taking place, what's the point of having HDMI?  When you have to employ the extra optical cable you lose HD audio capabilities.  They can only handle lossy 5.1 formats.  RCA can't even handle that.  They're limited to 2 channels.    And considering optical cables are more expensive than HDMI there's really no reason to go this route unless you already have the cables.  You may as well run the video directly to the TV and an optical to the receiver.  How is this not better than just running one HDMI to the receiver and one HDMI to the TV?  Perhaps I misunderstand the question.    EDIT: Going with the HDMI to TV and optical to receiver works just fine.  You'll get the lossy soundtrack, but that's not a big deal considering the cost of a new receiver.  HDMI is still a relatively new technology.  If you wait a couple of years you'll be able to pick up an HDMI switching a/v receiver for $200 or so.|`|ZWHZto1Baa	This is actually a very valid question.  There is something inherently inferior about using an optical connection for surround sound.  Optical connections can only handle Lossy audio formats like Dolby Digital and DTS.  While these formats are all well and good, They offer essentially mp3 level sound quality.  High Resolution formats such as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master audio offer what equates to lossless (CD quality) audio.  These formats are only available with an HDMI connection or through multichannel analog inputs.  Keep in mind that most players will not allow the output of High Resolution audio formats via analog cables because of HDCP.  Currently these formats are only available on blu-ray discs and the limited HD DVD content that still floats around on e-bay, but HDMI and High-rez audio is the way of the future.    If you can hear an audible difference between MP3 and CD, then you can hear the difference between high-resolution audio and lossy formats.  Seeing as you are a self-described audiophile, I would assume you can.    HDMI is a simple one cable solution that provides a noticeable difference in audio quality when used with the right equipment and content.|`|So1T9DKPaa	S/PDIF or RCA and Optical cable cannot carry Dolby TrueHD/DTS MA due to bandwidth limitations, as S/PDIF is limited to 5.1 channels of compressed discrete audio. When using S/PDIF, a device such as a Blu-ray Disc player will automatically send the Dolby Digital/DTS, respectively, audio.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	The great promise of HDMI was to simplify home theater wiring.  Ideally you would run 1 HDMI cable from your devices into your receiver, and 1 HDMI cable from your receiver to your TV/display.    Unfortunately, the paranoid dimwits at the MPAA were worried about people being able to make perfect digital copies using HDMI cabling.  So, they had an encryption scheme shoved into the HDMI spec called HDCP.    So now the combined audio and video signal coming out of your devices is now encrypted.  Most receivers can't even handle processing the combined audio and video signal when it's unencrypted and even fewer can handle a HDCP encrypted stream properly...    So much for the promise of HDMI.    Like other posters, I simply run HDMI directly to my TV for video, then run a second optical audio cable for audio to my receiver.  Some newer TVs can output the digital audio stream from the HDMI connection via optical audio, but my TV doesn't have this feature.  Sure, this means I'm not using my receiver as an A/V switch, but it makes the setup easier for my wife to use, and she doesn't care about surround sound unless we're watching a movie.    While my receiver is capable of supporting 7.1, I only have 5 speakers hooked up to it right now.  I honestly don't think having two extra speakers connected up is going to make a difference.  The room isn't that large for one thing.     I doubt very much most folks would be able to tell the difference between the newer digital audio format and plain old 5.1 - not to mention that we're only talking about blu-ray movies that support these newer audio modes.    Now, I have heard about a new HDMI spec that, among other things, would allow for 2-way communication on the cable.  This means your TV would be able to send the decoded digital audio signal back down the HDMI cable to the receiver, once again providing for the simplistic cabling layout that HDMI was supposed to have had in the first place.  Of course, we'll have to wait for this spec to get finalized and adopted by the industry.  I'm also guessing this will be a different type of cable and connector, requiring everyone to buy all new equipment and cabling - something I won't even be considering for at least 10 years or so.|`|kHwjvZKgaa	It's called advancing technology. One small cable takes the place of sever large wires.

In our society where relationships are becoming looser and looser and ties less binding, acquaintances and close friends alike find texting an easy way to stay in touch. Whereas email and a phone call can be deemed more formal, texting an informal way to communicate. While it can be impersonal, too, some people like it this way, i.e. communicating with people whom you would rather keep at a distance via texting. For example, a friend might invite you out to a party and you don't want to go, a seemingly simple way to get out of it is to simply text, "Sorry! Gotta babysit!" This is easier than phoning. People also use texting as a form of entertainment, texting in class and at work, in places where you are not able to sit and "talk" on the phone.|`|2QFe7onpaa	It allows couples to maintain a close relationship without having to spend every waking minute together or having to talk on the phone.

(30X$0.20) ($6.00) without plan. The reason people are addicted can be such as ease of short messages as a way to get a quick answers for short questions. A way to hide the conversation. An easy way to cheat on tests. And for some un-named celebrities, a way to break off a relationship.|`|0c7xGWERaa	I work for a major cell service provider, and this is what I tell people when they ask:    There are times when you need to ask or answer a question and if your in a place where it is not acceptable to call, then text messaging will make that possible.    i.e. if your in the theater and your daughter leaves a voice mail that she is leaving the house for the night. You cant call, and your not TOO worried about it but you do wanna know with who, where, and for how long. You can send a text w/out walking over a whole row of people to find out, or getting clobbered with soda for calling in the middle of a movie... or in a meeting at work... or court XD      then there is the situation where you need to pass info off to someone and you cant get a hold of them, you've left 3 voicemails but you need them to get the message ASAP. Send a text, and the next time they look at their cell there is a nice big message saying "New Text, read now?". Thus you have made sure that they have a better chance of getting that message as soon as they can.    It DOES alleviate boredom and beyond that, its away to pass along things you cant just tell over a phone easily.    ever have to spell out your name? and repeat a phone number 7 times before they get it right? or a difficult address... Texting is aweful usefull in this instance:    "Hey hunny, my cell is gonna die, but this is important, hang on.. ill text you the phone number" (or "ill text you the address, see you when you get here"), etc.    Or passing along hilarious videos or audio clips. or sending someone a ringtone they want. Or little e-love notes to that girl your sweet on, or a pic of flowers... etc.    words are only 7% of the human language... phone calls dont allow the whole range of communication through... texting helps communicate some things that voice only cant.    hope this helps :D

t5QqPTYqaa	This is a tough one. If search around, there seems to be endless debate on which is better. For me, it depends on what you need.

However, if you are talking about the insurance, keep in mind that the insurance is a completely different company from your cell phone provider (it's probably Asurion) and that there is a deductible just like with your car or home owner's insurance.  And the deductible is usually far cheaper than the retail cost of the phone, which is what you would have to pay if you did not have insurance.  The cheapest phone at retail at my carrier is 139.99 (and that's for an extremely basic phone), and the deductible on my insurance is 50.00.

c1sRWiX3aa	Do you remember which choice you chose? There are three. They are:      Print Shipping Label -- You can easily print a shipping label from the Xbox Support Web site. Printing the label yourself will shorten the time it takes to get your console to us for repair. To use this method, you need a printer and a box that you can use to ship your console to us.      Label Ship -- You will receive a pre-paid shipping label which will take approximately 4 days to get to you.      Standard -- You will receive a shipping box and a pre-paid shipping label which will take approximately 4 days to get to you.      Ok, it sounds as if you chose either one or two...most likely two. If so, no, you won't be receiving a box to ship it in. Nor if you got your shipping label via email. In fact when you select 'standard' shipping they ship you the box with the shipping label already on the box (or at worst inside of the box.) They wouldn't ship the box and the shipping label at different times as they are coming from the same place.    When you are ready to ship it take it to your local UPS shipping center. That's where I took mine. My box (plus the 'packing peanuts') cost me just over $3. But that three dollars was well worth it to me for the three or four days of 'waiting time' I saved by having my shipping label emailed to me versus mailed to me. (Personally, I don't think 'Label Ship' should even exist. You should either get your label that day...via an email...or you should receive both the box and a shipping label at the same time. But that's just my opinion.)    Good luck.|`|wIM3vNtwaa	If you asked them to send you a shipping label by email rather than courier (which it sounds like you have) they won't send you a box, you have to find one|`|CAAcoqtYaa	Ok whats the question.|`|yBuKIocraa	I just fixed my xbox myself, get some arctic silver five, a heat gun, some bolts and throw away the x c lamps.

Take it to a UPS store and they will package it up properly for you and send it.  I did it a few months ago and it cost less than $10 to do it.  It was much easier than me searching for a box and trying to find the correct way to pack it.  I got it back fixed and playing again.
imaeeL9Naa	Depending on your modem, it is possible that MAC filtering has been turned on, but only if you've done it.  Have you tried resetting your modem?  Find the manual online for resetting it not just restarting.      I'd also invest in a router.  That way you can have both your computer and xbox connected at all times and that should limit the number of issues you might have.  You can get some fairly inexpensive routers at most stores.

c3cc29e235a754ea13be42bc0c1a5306aa	Cable tuning on most older TV sets means you need to select CABLE in the setup menu instead selecting AIR, the default for channel tuning.  IF the TV is set to AIR you can only tune in channels 2 through 13 and possibly see some other channels randomly but they seem a little off color or mistuned (snowy).    As for that message maybe it reads Unblock or Blocked which means that you need to change the V-chip settings to allow all channels.  IF they did not change the code for the V-chip in the menu you can enter 0000 and change the settings.  Or you may have to get the code to reset the TV from the manufacturer.
AA10775666	Both Cricket and Verizon W use the same cell technology (CDMA) so it is possible to make their phones work on the other network BUT CDMA phones don't use sim cards, and cannot be unlocked. CDMA phones have to be flashed to another provider's software and settings each time you want to change providers, which can possibly brick the phone each time it is flashed. once you got the phone flashed from a local cell store or purchased the phone already flashed then Cricked will set it up for you!!!

nE64Hn8Paa	It depends: how hard are you willing to work? If you only play music that is easy for you, it will take many, many years.  If you play technically challenging music, you will get much faster far more quickly.    If you ask any shredder how they got as fast as they did, they will tell you one thing: practice your scales.  To play quickly, you need to know instantly which note you'll play next, where each finger will go and when it needs to be there in order to play whatever phrase  you have in your head.  All of this achieved by muscle memory, which can be gained only one way: repetition.    So, here is a simple list of modes you need to learn to play quickly:  Ionian (major), Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian (minor), and Locrian.  Each mode is relative to the next,  find a good guitar teacher or book if you can't get what you need to understand this online.    You need to know you Major Pentatonic and Minor Pentatonic scales by heart as well as the "blue" note within them.  These are the scales most frequently used by shred metal.  From Metallica to Sepultura to Satriani to Malmsteen, these are a MUST.     What is also helpful is to make sure that you can find any note along your fret board.  To do this, first find every "E" on the fretboard up to the 12th fret. Set a metronome to a comfortable speed and play each "E" in succession front ways, then back.  Speed up the metronome a few beats and do it again, and again until you have it down.  Then, do the same for F, G, A, B, ect until you have all of the natural notes down.  Then, do the same for all of the flats/sharps.  Don't try to do this all in one day.  Give yourself a note a week and add it to the others you've practiced.  Make this part of your normal warm up routine.    A warm up routine is crucial to working on your speed.  There are a million different ways to warm up.    A simple one is to use the chromatic scale.  Start with your first finger on the 1st fret, 2nd on the 2nd fret, 3rd on 3rd, on 4th on 4th.  Play each fret on each string starting on the low E string and working your way up.  When you get to the 4th fret on  the high e string, move your hand up one fret, and do the same from the high e back to the low E.  Then, play the frets backwards (after moving your hand up a fret) and move from the low E to the high, up a fret, and back down.  Repeat until you get past the 12th fret.      There are (like I said) a million ways to warm up.  It is best to get a guitar teacher to show you some of the best ways to warm up.    Steve Vai, a hailed speed player, practices  4 to 10 hours a day, and he is rewarded greatly for this.  He has given the GuitarWorld magazine his practice routine, and you can order the issue off of their website, if you are interested.    The speed mechanics books are great too.  Keep in mind, though, that you cannot ask a book a question - get a guitar teacher.|`|0I6GNzGpaa	what kinda fast you talking about? like petrucci fast or just fast like above average fast? for petrucci fast i couldnt tell you. havent reached that level and probably never will. but just for above average fast it s taken me almost 2 years of playing. if you want to get fast just take out a metronome and just run scales. i know the way petrucci does it is to increase by intervals of 8 beats. make sure you can play at a speed comfortably before increasing. and make sure youre playing in time. you can play at a million beats per minute but it wont matter if you cant play it in time

Today we have so many different formats being used, we have to depend on an Audio Conversion program to help us with that. Fortunately most are free to the public. You can go to www.google.com and in the search box, type in Audio Conversion and it will take you to page after page of places that will allow you to download their conversion program at no charge. So many people are now trying to save their old movies on VHS by copying them to a blank DVD.

e79a6ead0b057ff9d302561a7fd12b9caa	More base stations means smaller cells which means increased capacity.  Congestion isn't much of a problem on the radio side. More base stations are placed where there are more phones, so the base station density is much higher in metropolitan areas.  In Europe, mobile penetration is 90% or higher, so this isn't a problem that is going to get much worse.    With 3G networks, there is no hard limit on the number of simultaneous voice channels over the radio. This is a feature of CDMA technology.|`|a622c7735dcf1f2b30c078ce3f099d2baa	because the signal towers essentially transmit a blanket of electromagnetic radiation that picks up the radiation from your phone and locks on to it there is a maximium capacity for the number of phones that can be active at one time but that is only involved with the amount of processing technology they have at the tower not the transmission dish itself     if they ever have too many subscribers in one aera they just get another dozen computers to handle the slave work and get on with their lives    the reason you loose bars is something is blocking the radiation or you are in an aera where the blanked does not reach and your signal has nowhere to go

(it's bright orange) its great for adjusting tone, and gain. also very affordable... i use it with my crybaby.

WHx01YBzaa	i dont think you can...unless you buy from itunes store...idk i've never tried you can google it 
AA11314523	yes, you can..     Normally, when you upload your ipod, itunes will sync with your ipod. therefore, if you have deleted the videos from your hard disc, the video will get deleted from your ipod too..     therefore, instead of letting itunes sync with your ipod, you can click and drag the video into your ipod.     Bad point: once you have chose this option, you will have to click and drag all your future uploads...     Good point: if you are at your friend's place and he has some songs in his itunes that you like, you can click and drag the songs into your ipod too..     if you think that this is troublesome, you might want to follow the answer 2.|`|feb06ada8eb4befed0808a24753330a7aa	Yaaaaa.

gERaZGZeaa	Use the component cables (red green blue) that come with the box.  These carry 720p and 1080i perfectly fine.  It also has an optical output that you can plug in to your receiver to get 5.1 surround.  It's definitely worth it, because games such as Dead Space are REALLY pushing the envelope when it comes to sound design.  It also helps you distinguish where bad guys are. :p|`|AevtOtzPaa	The included cable is crisp and clear and you will not be able to notice any difference with HDMI cable so save your money.
gIn29wqoaa	The best thing to do is to put it into recovery mode:    When the phone is off  Press n hold HOME and the POWER button for ten (10) seconds    Then release the POWER button still holding the HOME button for a further 10 seconds.    Try to do with with the phone plugged into your computer and that will tell you when its worked then restore your handset the normal way.

There is a GTA game coming to the DS (GTA: Chinatown Wars), the Godfather port for the Wii was as close to a GTA experience as you can get on the Wii (and it had great gesture controls that made for a more visceral experience, despite the graphics compromise), and have you seen any of the Trailers for Mad World?

As a general rule one message is not going to result in an arrest for harassment unless it is backed up with other messages and/or other verbal, physical or written communications.

And that might mean putting down a deposit. I had to put down a big one $300 when i was 17.|`|VaRae8dkaa	Your parents are probably canceling the phone for a good reason. If you really want to involve your uncle in your affairs then just apply for another contract with his credentials. But I don't recommend that. I bet if you wait it out something will turn up soon. Show your parents that you have responsibility and pay the time for whatever you did.    Good luck with it however it end up though :)|`|TSUyp9Opaa	Your story is still long.    You can contact the provider to see if you can reactivate the phone. But it might nodify the parents. You can also create new account, but you might lose the number.    |`|o0Vm0w7jaa	depending on what carrier you use... if it is under your parents plan i don't know that there is much you can do other then when it is cancelled take it to a carrier and tell them a friend gave the phone to u and that you want to flash it and then get the plan to your liking and then your parents pretty much can't do anything |`|uK3zYbw6aa	Unless you are the owner that is listed on the account there isn't much you can do. If you are the owner of the account then just call the cell company and tell them the changes you would like to be made.

41f4c07b76e1599b2fce4ea6a1bfed44aa	There could be a number of reasons:    1) Dry joint that makes contact when the TV is cold but breaks when the TV heats up (if everything goes off it is likely to be on the Power Supply Unit)  2) A capacitor on the PSU is breaking down (going short-circuit) and causing the problem.  3) Possibly the fan cooling the bulb is covered in dirt and the bulb is overheating, and the TV has an over temperature shutdown.    You could unplug the TV and open it up.  Look at the solder joints and reflow any dodgy looking joints with a soldering iron.

3TqPF1zMaa	Regarding the lack of an autofocus motor & screw in the Nikon D40, D40x and D60; it's my opinion that this "issue" has been far overblown.    The autofocus motor is for older, mechanical screw, "AF" autofocus lenses. There are still some of these lenses in Nikon's catalogue but every new lens they produce uses the newer, superior, AF-S autofocus system which works with all Nikon SLR cameras.    You can still use an older, AF Nikon lens on a D40 if you need or want to by manually focusing it.    Disclosure: I am the owner of http://www.lenslenders.com in Canada.|`|t2rUhyANaa	In that price range the two best choices are the Canon XSi (aka 450D) and Nikon D60. Either will serve you well throughout your classes.    Being a Canon man myself, I recommend the XSi. My first dSLR was a Rebel XT which I enjoyed enormously and the new XSi is better in every way and cheaper, too !|`|6584a2c112e4342d61a5a55cbb9aafd0aa	Assuming you mean dollars, and not pounds or some other denomination, MY recommendation would be finding a decent package around a Nikon D40. The kit I got when I bought my D50 had an 18-55 and a 70-300. Something similar would probably be a good starting place for you. I personally don't get as much use out of the 70-300, but you appear to go and shoot outdoors a lot more than I do, so I think you'd get good use out of a longer telephoto. Also things like the window reflection on the shot out the car window would be eliminated if you had a circular polarizer, a good and inexpensive little add on that I think will be useful to you. At some point it looks like you might want to find a decent macro lens. You seem to enjoy doing some close-up work and you'll like the results with a good macro. The bad news is it's going to be out of your initial budget, so keep learning and saving or find someone with deep pockets that wants to give you something for your birthday, lol.    Your imaging class will introduce you to some cool editing tools. Start looking at contrast and color manipulation. Your B&W stuff could benefit from some contrast manipulation to give it more punch and if you do some fairly minor curve adjustments on your color stuff you can make colors really pop and they'll stand out.    You're off to a good start, enjoy your class.    Any current lenses you buy for your D40 will more than likely be AF-I or AF-S anyway. I'd say to deal with the "limitation" for now, take your class, expand your abilities, then upgrade the body, which you'll want to do at some point anyway.|`|HBNx77BBaa	This Nikon D40 kit from Adorama looks pretty good at $600. Includes two lenses...    http://www.adorama.com/INKD40K2A.html?se...    For a view on the D40 have a look here...    http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/recommen...    The lack of an autofocus motor only matters is you have some old lenses you need to use on the body. Modern lenses have the motors built in. If you've got to have the internal motor then you'll have to look at the D90, or the D80 which it's replaced.|`|567c6b249f5eaa8b96d284566ebe653faa	I would look for a used Nikon D2 or something along those lines (professional). I bought a used Nikon D1 on E-bay for $230, and am enjoying it very much.|`|6xEpscamaa	The lenses that you would use with a D40 have the autofocus motor built into them.  Auto focus is a snap with these.  You want AF-S lenses (pretty much any modern Nikon lens you would want is AF-S)    I have the D40 and I think it is a fantastic camera.  I got the package of the kit camera, a 55-200 mm VR lens, and a Nikon bag for $600 a year ago.  I'm sure you could find a better price these days, or you could go for a D60.

The ROI return on investment is not really worth it for most systems.    However if you are running cables 10 feet or longer, distances or near lots of radio waves, better cables are a must.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Nope.  Well, not better than any other HDMI cable.  If you want a cable buy the cheapest one you can find.  If we all stick together we can force Monster to stop scamming people into overpaying for HDMI cables.|`|AA11593071	I,ll have to disagree with all these wrong answers, if  you to take enough of that cheap junk back to get things working  you would know why I,ll only buy the best from now on.|`|R4rlYxqBaa	NO!     Don't believe the hype, monster is good but way overpriced. If you don't care about spending money you should get it. Though if money is tight just get a regular brand cable from your retailers. I wouldn't say go to the dollar store but there won't be any noticeable difference. Monster has these gimmicks about signal protection and all that but unless you are spanning long distances past 20 feet you don't have to worry about signal interference or break down at the least.|`|UlT4wV04aa	There is no proof that there is ANY quality difference between using a HD-MI cable that costs 120 or one that costs 10, This was proven on a program called the gadget show.  The reason is that it is down to the "DVD" player, the cable only carries the quality that the DVD player can give out and again, the TV can only display qualities that it can. The cable has nothing to do with the quality really.
OXGFqtX1aa	Neither limewire or itunes  I used before Ares and its just fine but, don't share anything|`|lN9jcKYhaa	1. download lime wire version 4.2.18 or whatever the ending is just as long as its 4.2    2. when you double click  on the songs it will ask you how you want your music to be played and when it says choose itunes and that music will be added to the library of itunes. after that you can drag and drop it into you ipod    if the only problem is that your ipod is not connecting to the computer maybe just get a connecting cable or maybe the usb port on the computer is messed up.     another way to get music to your ipod is Amarok.  Homepage: http://amarok.kde.org/   Version: 1.4.4 (10/30/2006)       AmarokGNU/Linux audio player with support for many audio devices  Amarok is a GNU/Linux audio player. While developed initially for KDE, its currently desktop independent. One of its advantages is support for many audio devices, including iPod, iRiver, etc. Upon the first run, youre given the opportunity to set up your library. Unfortunately, out of the box on Ubuntu 6.10, the iPod wasnt detected, but a quick configuration change made all the difference: SettingsConfigure AmarokMedia DeviceAdd DevicePlugin (Apple iPod), name (iPod), and mount point (/media/ipod).    One of [Amaroks] advantages is support for many audio devices, including iPod, iRiver   Copying music from the iPod is as simple as right-clicking and selecting Manage FilesCopy Track to Collection. As it adds files to Amaroks library, the file is neatly named and placed in an appropriate folder (youre given the option of which folder naming scheme youd like). Copying to the iPod from your collection is similarly easy: right-click, Transfer to Media Device, select the Media Device and click Transfer. Amarok automatically checks for duplicate tracks, which is nice. The album cover function works quite nicely, fetching the image from Amazon or another external source. Playlists also work quite well.|`|fL6jNee5aa	I use both  I download my music from limewire and then transfer it to itunes to put it onto my ipod.    Find out where your music from limewire is saving (like which files on your computer)  and once you do that you can import that file into itunes.|`|0E6u2YOGaa	I'd figure out why your iPod isn't appearing.    Using Limewire won't change that.|`|yj3i682Zaa	Well. I think you should download frostwire. Just go to frostwire.com.  Its WAY better and faster and smoother than limewire. I promise.|`|jXK0YZvfaa	Its easy...  1) install iTunes.... iPods need iTunes to work  2) go to limewire.com and install an "earlier release" but limewire 5 works great for me  3) download music using limewire, go to the folder were it downloaded it to, and drag the files over to iTunes (drag and drop them into the iTunes "music library")    iTunes is NOT EVER necessary for downloading music, just syncing the iPod|`|o4ygHWLxaa	Yes, limewire will work but itunes gives you the pics, crisper images, and movies, dont forget the music sounds great.|`|INAiAOD6aa	Go to www.limewire.com and click on the choice on the right dont download limewire pro, for an ipod you have to actualy get the songs you want, and put them on a cd, then load the cd on to itunes and do it that way, to make a cd you down load a song and you pull up windows media player behind it so that you can see both screens, put limewire on top and drag what you downloaded onto windows media player, trust me it will work. Ive done it before. I also suggest not leaving limewire on your computer it really screws it up, my mom had to pay 600 dollars for fixing my computer becus of it. You can just instal it and uninstal it when you are done, yes its timley but its free and will save your computer.  good luck!|`|74QEDymVaa	ok first off...limewire SUCKS    second i recommend that you get tillawire, its nothing like limewire and it works awesome! its free too so yea...get itunes to sort your music and stuff but dont sign up for it|`|wKxWcqkMaa	i like Using itunes to play my music but i don't buy songs from it. I use a Torrent called Vuze (Formely Azeurus) and i use a website isohunt.com. I like downloading in bulk so i download albums or discographies at a time... i find it more conveniant than having to download each individual song and i find songs that i never knew i liked from that artist because i just put my songs on random.|`|jBEe6Sqdaa	You can use limewire but you have to install ITunes.  Your ipod won't sync without it.  Once you download itunes its easy.  go to itunes.com to get the download.    Download into Limewire as usual making sure you know where your files are downloaded to on your PC.  Open itunes and click File.  Select Copy folder to library (FOLDER not file) and viola, your music appears in itunes.  Everytime you download new music you copy your folder to itunes.    NOTE:  Make sure you do NOT set itunes to be your default media player.  For some reason when I do this it messes everything up.  NOTE 2:  Sometimes when copying the folder into itunes it will duplicate your music.  If this happens select all of your music in itunes, delete, and copy again.  You lose your playlists but it's quicker than deleting your entire library by hand.    If you don't like the version of limewire you currently have then uninstall and reinstall a different version....no sweat.  Also, when you install and set up limewire you tell it where to put your music.  One way to find is to search you pc files for a song or artist you know you have downloaded.  When it locates the file you will see the file path so you can find it.  You should be able to change where your files are stored in your settings options in Limewire.  Good Luck!|`|qTYx1asLaa	when you go to the website, try downloading a slightly older version.  i like limewire also, but honestly if that doesn't work, use VDownloader.  it's a free software just like limewire except it allows you to pull music from youtube and other sites that have the URL link underneath the video info.  that's all it needs to work, simply put the format into mp3(audio only).  hope this helps and good luck!!!
s7DtIxXhaa	Checkout the FAQ at http://pandorabuys.notlong.com
t2rUhyANaa	You have the right idea by looking at a dSLR as point & shoot cameras are useless for action shots.    The D40 can take 2.5 shots per seconds. That's not very fast.  A much better choice in that price range is the Canon XSi (aka 450D) which can take 3.5 shots per second.    if you are planning to shoot indoors you will need a "fast" lens. That's a lens with a wide opening, something in the f2.8 range or better. For outdoors f4 will be ok.    EDIT-  I read the other answers and I disagree. You will not be able to consistently take good action shots by just taking one pic at a time. The action goes by too fast for you to react to the perfect moment. You want a good pic of a person jumping ? then take several shots throughout the jump. fps matters, indeed.|`|qIR9DB9Haa	Yes its fine. Your just referring to stopping motion, so all you need is a fast enough shutter speed. Im sure the Nikon D40 can go up to 1/4000 of a sec so that is plenty fast. Anything above 1/250 of a sec should be fine for someone jumping. fps or frames per  second is of no consequence in this case as you are not looking to do a sequence action shot. Even if you wanted to you couldnt find a camera capable of getting enough shots in within the time of a person jumping for less than $2000.|`|Kr2TIUsAaa	You should look at the shutter speed limit of a camera if you want fast moving objects to be captured perfectly on film/digital media.     However, be advised that if you raise the shutter speed, you have to have proper lighting.|`|AQ4b4Iilaa	The D40's continuous shooting mode is too slow, the Sony A200 will give you faster performance.  I use continuous shooting on my A200 and for the price, it is fast.    The A200 has a longer list of other features over the D40 too.

vCl9dJ2oaa	I don't know!
GLJyBe1Jaa	Get a Classic. They may be big, but they have huge space. I have an iPod Touch, and I use it for music, which is the whole point of an iPod. I got the Touch for it's music, (I got 16gb), but a minor reason is because it's different, the touch screen, few cool apps, etc.    So if you want a decent music player, get the Classic, the Touch is too expensive for 8gb. Get a 16gb or Classic. :)    8gb is really small memory, it's like 6 or 7 originally, and the apps will take up a lot of it.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	That all depends on what you mean by 'best'.  Do you mean best value for money?  Most reliable?  Longest lasting?  Cheapest?  Most popular?  largest storage capacity  What exactly do you mean?|`|lAP3UC79aa	well you should get the ipod classic.|`|LvEFgLWcaa	The i-pod touch cuz its touch screen and you can have wiked games on it and play music|`|fbcedfd3a07035b9051669ec9dc7e594aa	ipod touch becasue it's good looking , the new version has external speaker, nice picture/videos, WIFI (go on the internet,myspace,facebook etc.) you can put your contacts on it, cool games, i think you can even get gps on it too.. thats all i can think of right now but theres probably alot more reasons, the only con i guess is the price butif you go for the 16gb it's reasonably priced
AA10179458	Applicable only to Xbox 360s with the HDD. Cold boot (power on) while holding the GREEN button to clear the HDD's cache. This should reduce the game's choppiness for a while.This works on Oblivion and im sure the same thing is happening on Skate.
hJP9y6kjaa	Contrary to popular opinion, a high-grade "audiophile" cable is no better than 10-gauge lamp cord. As long as the connection is solid and clean and the cable capacitance isn't outrageous, then cables really don't make a difference at all to the tone.    I know some people out there are offended by the idea, they may say they have golden ears and can hear the difference between a 10$ Rapco cable and a 50$ Mogami cable. I maintain that the only difference between cables is mechanical and electrical - if it's made well and won't fall apart, and if the resistance and capacitance are within spec, then it *doesn't* *matter*.    A very poor quality splitter jack may affect the sound, sure. If the connections aren't well made, or it doesn't conduct well, then yeah, it will affect the sound. If it's not shielded properly, then totally, it can introduce noise.    Tell you what - here's a really easy test. Get a digital multimeter, put one lead on one side of the splitter, and the other on each of the other sides in turn. The resistance on a well-conducting electrical connection should be very small - possibly on the order of a few milliohms.    Even if the resistance approached a few tenths of an ohm the overall impact is negligible compared to the other elements in the signal chain. See the link below - it's a great resource.    Again, digital multimeters are pretty cheap (20-40$) and if you're doing any type of DIY electronics you're going to need to own one anyways.... the numbers don't lie!    I must make a caveat for cables with high capacitance. Capacitance can cause some high end roll-off. I think for most applications, especially with shorter leads, the effect is negligible except with cables that are completely unfit for transmitting an audio signal.    So make sure the cable and connecter are shielded, and that the construction is decent (and that it doesn't have a molded plastic plug at the end, so you can get into it and resolder it if it ever goes bad) and you should be good to go.    I own Rapco cables... pretty inexpensive, but well made. I've only had one fail in three years (out of dozens). When I first started, I bought Monster cables... and all *but* one failed within two years (out of 8). And of course I can't resolder them, since they have those dang molded plastic ends....    Saul|`|475c01dc76b1f175b986a137414d9e50aa	Your links did not work - but I would just get the better cable if you can afford it.    Saul - I totally agree with you.  I'm just saying for a small "Y" cable, it might be better to get the better one if it is not too expensive.
b6e0dc8ffe2b0db9a1e3d82efa351d40aa	I don't think so.  You can try using the Deshaker plugin for VirtualDub - it's free and can do a good job.  It takes a long time though, so only process the video that needs it.
YHu0s3JZaa	You can play PS2 games on any PS3 made before February 2008.  If you bought one after that date, or if you are going to buy one then it will not work.    But I heard Sony might bring back the backward compatibility on newer PS3 models starting summer 09.    -Wiiplay_ds|`|B2Itq6Fcaa	only on the 60gb and old 80gb|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	The only models that play PS2 games are:    20GB-Discontinued, all PS2 games $500  60GB-Discontinued, all PS2 games $600, later $550  Old 80GB-Discontinued, 80% of PS2 games $500    The following DO NOT:    40GB-Discontinued $400  New 80GB-in stores $400  160GB-in stores $500    All PS3's play PSone games.    An easy way to tell if a PS3 will play PS2 games    4USB ports=YES  2USB ports=NO    The reason is that the cost of putting the PS2 chip/CPU  and the PS2 graphics card in the PS3 was VERY expensive,  and as the PS2 only has about a year left (before it is  discontinued), Sony saw no reason to lose even more  money than they already are losing on the PS3, and  hence there is no backwards compatibility on PS3's today.|`|kuBKzJStaa	Yes you can.|`|qvl3PjdEaa	The current PS3's do not have backwards compatibility.    the 40gig PS3's are the best for that. If you want B/C... check Amazon Marketplace, Princerunner and Ebay.

You can always get yourself a cheap used PS2 for any older PS2 games you have|`|AA11457479	only on certain models.. check on ps website|`|gacUoH5Vaa	Yes|`|zI4dp3i7aa	the old ps3's i think you can, but not on the new ones. im not sure though.|`|WGGxl2Qiaa	no you can't unless you bought them wen they 1st came out. as not enough ppl bought them at start so they reduced the price then up'ed the memory and took out being able to play ps2games    - if ur gona buy one now they wouldn't play ps2 games     =]
DIxbib1paa	you question isnt clear enough|`|4Pk6VNftaa	If you used your PS3 with a HDMI cable in the past, you have to reset the video settings to use any other type of cable.    To do this, simply connect the PS3 to the TV using the other cable and be sure you've disconnected the HDMI cable completely.  Now hold down the power button on the front for 10 seconds.  The PS3 will beep a few times, and you should see the image on the screen.|`|EMk4iBEOaa	Did you set the tv to the right input setting for the AV cables and did you plug in the cables to the right input slots not the output slots...

VcNHahtgaa	Don't listen to the guy above me.    Square Enix comfirmed it will not reach outside of Japan until April 2010 or maybe later.    So FF13 will be in the US + EU by April-Dec 2010. I know, it's a long time to wait, but it will be worth it.    The Japanese Version is coming this year though. No one knows when Versus will come out.|`|1WgOj89kaa	rumoured for mid 2009
iaNWdSj5aa	Try googling it
GqHHVzf0aa	The kitten and her mom appear in towns randomly after they have visited another player's town. What you have to do is find which town the mom is in, she has to be in one of your friends' towns. When they are reunited, you will recieve an Apple TV, a Lily Pad Table, a Lovely Phone, aMusic Box, a Papa Bear, or a Portrait. Good luck!|`|BMConIedaa	The Kitten's mom is in a friend's town you've visited recently.    There is no way to help her without returning to your friend's town.  Her and her mom are characters who visit your town after you visit someone else's town, or if someone visits yours.    If you can't go online, you can't help her out.
0806e6e7cf26dee397f58421b5e679beaa	According to the Kodak website the remote is part of the package contents, I also tried searching online but no luck, if it did not came with your photo frame, return it to the store, otherwise keep looking on ebay that you may get lucky or just sell yours on ebay without the remote and buy another one.
Fe1Z7fpbaa	always go for small people so toad, baby peach or baby mario/luigi, and i usually pick bullet bike, because its fast and easy to control, or the magicruiser if you have it. the quacker is ok, but a bit dodgy on corners. auto mode is easiest    personally i wouldnt reccomend cars. the handling isnt very good, compared to bikes, and they often earent as fast. however, avoid bikes like the wario bike because when you go round corners your character will stick out their leg which slows you down and makes handling harder (or in boo's case his tongue!)    my favourite combinatinos are koopa trooper and the bullet bike, dry bones with the bullet bike or baby mario with the magicruiser    hope i helped!!!  clo  xx|`|B37zeyGeaa	ok so the player makes no difference AT ALL in driving. theres 3 categories, big medium small. luigi is medium.     personally i love the blue falcon or the magikruiser, which i use with dry bones. they are great    but every1 likes their own    oh and if u havent unlocked those guys u probably havent unloked wii outfit B either|`|DZCFD0p2aa	I like the big guys like DK or Bowser because they can ram people out of their way and have some good swimsuit mamo handle. The traditional Kart is my fav although I also like the monster kart with the horns in front...most stable with good turning. Speed isn't worth much for most tracks.|`|uatPKvTsaa	I personally pick Baby Mario or Dry Bones and the Bullet Bike just because of their ability to regain speed quickly when knocked off course.|`|dSkV8q7kaa	it's down to your driving style, but i always find the smaller players (baby mario, toad) and the basic bikes are best. they are faster but i think harder to control, whereas bigger players are vice versa.
8AYA5gTBaa	I would recommend the Diana Dreamer, which is really a DianaF+. You get the option of adding a flash in the future. The standard Diana+ has no provision to mount a flash.    For more tips and tricks for the Diana, check out my website:  http://dianacamera.com    For how to videos for the Diana, check out my youtube channel:  http://youtube.com/user/kaituba|`|t2rUhyANaa	Other than the removable lens, which can be a useful feature, it is the same camera. Well, that, and the fact that the Dreamer has "Dreamer" embossed on the lens and comes only with a mint-green body, which I guess is ok if you like that sort of thing ;)
ky8X8G7saa	It's true that the adapter is much faster.  There is really no difference between which you use other than speed.  I think the only thing you might want to use your cable instead of your adapter is if you need to update the firmware.
4Pk6VNftaa	No such luck.    It's possible that Sony could create a software emulator that would add limited PS2 compatibility to the PS3s that have none right now, but I doubt Sony will bother putting in the effort.  They'd rather you go and buy a PS2 if you want to play PS2 games.  At least they make a little bit of profit off each PS2 sold, as opposed to losing money on each PS3.|`|HekFanRvaa	Sony will not hack their own system. and there is no more new 40GB. Its obsolete.|`|MNY5gMGBaa	I dont know how but there is a software you can download from the Playstation website that will enable you to play PS2 games on your PS3.   My mate did it, i think its somewhere in user setting as well.     Hope this Helped : )
c1sRWiX3aa	jay munro's answer is exactly right. To elaborate a bit on his answer....    When you ship your console in to Microsoft for repair they are SUPPOSED to do what he told you to do FOR you. Unfortunately, it sounds as if they didn't.    Basically, even though your downloadable content (maps, games, etc) saves directly to your hard drive under a specific profile there is still a 'key' (for lack of a better word) that floats in cyber space that is associated with your console. What has happened is this: When they replaced your 360 they didn't do the 'transfer' so your 'key' is still associated' with your old 360 and not your new one.    Simply click the link below and follow the instructions they provide. ;)|`|evhwdzG3aa	you need to goto account management and then download history and it will allow you to download everything you have paid for at no extra cost you can only transfer the license over once every 12month   hope that answers your question

Of the two that you mentioned, I can give the Malibu high marks- good tone, feel, etc. But I havn't played the FR50 (I'm not huge on resonators).    :-D|`|al28dgRmaa	craigslist

0806e6e7cf26dee397f58421b5e679beaa	The Samsung has better video but it uses a 28mm lens that for most type of photography it's too wide in my opinion, the IXUS 80 IS is one of the best compact cameras you can buy, it has image stabilization, macro as close as 3cm, superb battery life and many other features!

DolkCwxIaa	Like you suggest, Sky is essentially masking the real cost of the box by hiding it away either in an installation fee or offsetting it against a year-long multiroom subscription.

BhNP2P8Xaa	iPhones are designed and built for GSM networks. Most of the rest of the world uses GSM. T-Mobile and AT&T are the two major GSM providers in the US. Verizon and Sprint are not.    This is why you can't (and probably will never be able to) use an iPhone on Verizon. GSM phones use sim cards. CDMA phones (Verizon, sprint, alltel, etc) do not. They are incompatible with each other.    Unlocking a phone means the device has been altered electronically to allow other carriers to use the phone. For example, if you have AT&T, you can use an "unlocked" T-Mobile phone by slipping the sim card in. Works the other way around. This is useful to people who travel and buy PAYG sim cards in foreign countries.|`|lAP3UC79aa	i dont think so, cause the sidekick from t-mobile never went to another phone company.. i doubt apple will let verizon or any other company have it. thats how they make more money! cause people will want to get at&t just to get the iphone, or people will wanna get t-mobile just to get the sidekick.
ky8X8G7saa	If that phone is like my lg shine, then this should work.  You have to go to a blank text message screen, then click options, and go to writing language...(something like that)...and there should be an option that says t9 dictionary.  Then you can go into the dictionary and delete it.    I hope that helps.|`|gB5LP70Laa	u cant but if u use another word more often then that word appears first.  but check is the language for ur T9 set to English.

d9vu2VVaaa	If you're painting a green screen, how come people's faces are washed out by the light?    Ensure your cam meters the light on the faces, not the screen.    With the green screen perfectly vertical, nothing in the way, a wash up from the floor, side, or overhead, will do it.  It's not supposed to light the subjects at all.    Are you getting shadows on the screen?  Surely you're only lighting the screen?  Repositioning the light will solve that, unless the light is naturally leaky/has a wide spread.    Those $20 halogen shop floor lights from Walmart are way good enough.    Otherwise, there's a number of options.  Most involve using light that is not aimed directly at the subject(s).  I prefer to use as little additional light as possible.  Using more lighting can create more problems with great ease.  Only use the light for the green screen.    If you choose to, or have no other choice but to use limited lighting, diffusers and reflectors etc are essential.     Reflectors and diffusers when placed properly can soften and/or spread the light, help avoid those unpleasant shadows, bring out the important parts of the shot, etc etc.    But they can be expensive if you buy "photographic items".  There are great alternatives, think sideways.  The kind of foldable reflectors that are designed to reduce the heating up by the sun - the springy aluminised sheets that pop out flat are good.  Also using white card etc. can work.  All for less than ten bucks.  I've used scrunched up kitchen foil, white towels, sheets at a pinch.    Bounce the light back at the screen to keep it away from the subjects.    And you always have to pay attention to white balance.|`|t2rUhyANaa	It's hard to get even illumination with just one light source. A paint light is cheap, but it's also very harsh. You need some kind of diffuser: try hanging a white bed sheet in front of it. Also, dont't be afraid to experiment with the placement of the light. You can also use a reflector to even out some the uneven lighting. A piece of white foam core works very well in this role.  The point is that your light isn't bolted down. Don't be afraid to experiment !|`|7SXA5dhDaa	One trick to get good light is to point your light source at the ceiling or a nearby wall.  It spreads the light and lights up faces.|`|567c6b249f5eaa8b96d284566ebe653faa	Get yourself a light meter and learn how to use it.|`|KPJ8uFuUaa	There is a lot of short films info on http://thehotmovies.info !
DIxbib1paa	No the ps2 games will NOT work on your laptop, how dumb are you for even asking!|`|HekFanRvaa	Those are only to tell you what media is used (CD, DVD or Blu-ray). it doesn't mean you can use it to play on compatible media reader. You can see the files on your laptop but you wont be able to play it because you need a software to use it which is not compatible with laptops' OS. Unless you get an emulator.    take for example, the cotton shirt. It's cotton but doesn't necessarily mean you can use it to wash or disinfect your wounds just because it says cotton..|`|ilScrvPEaa	They won't work, because PS2 discs use different coding. But, if you install PS2 emulator - you can play PS2 games on PC, however you need a powerful machine to do it.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Of course, laptops or any computers  can play any format|`|YHu0s3JZaa	No.  DVD disks that are for the PS2 use different codes, meaning your computer cannot understand it.  They can only be played in the PS2.    Unless, it is a DVD video. Then yes, it can be played in your PC.  But if it says PlayStation 2 on the disk, then no.    But there is software that will allow for you to copy the disk onto your PC. But most of this software is illegal.     -Wiiplay_ds|`|vJj6lo4faa	Well, your laptop can read the disks, it will show you the game files on the DVD.  But the game will not work on your laptop. You will need a PS2 emulator to have it work on your laptop. Normally these games require very high requirements to play.|`|Ax8CiGIiaa	You CAN physically (but I don't know about legally) play PS2 games on a DVD-ROM equipped computer. If you have some of the newer, dual-layer game DVDs, such as Gran Turismo 4, you will need a dual layer DVD-ROM    To do this, you need a program called an 'emulator'. When you run this program, it simulates the PS2 operating system on your computer. Usually it will have a basic menu where you can change settings or run games. You must have a pretty powerful computer to run PS2 emulators.    Since I'm not sure on the legality of using emulators, I won't list any here. If you are in dire need of one, look up "PS2 emulator" on google or altavista. There are quite a few out there.

ONxaI24Daa	Well your problem is with your graphics chip. The 7050 chip is an integrated graphics chip, meaning it's just the graphics processor, not a full on graphics card. Running a resource heavy game like CoD is going to be tough if that's all you've got.     Is it a laptop or a desktop?    Edit: I'm going to assume you're running a desktop because you said PC.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	Most cameras come with a cable and software to help move/copy pictures from the camera to a computer, but there is a better way.    The following information describes a better way to move/copy photos to and from a computer and memory card.     Just received some pictures in an e-mail which I moved to the computer.  Then copied these pictures to a memory card and could view them on my camera or show on TV.      If your computer has memory card slots, find the correct slot and copy pictures from the memory card to the computer.     If there are no memory card slots on your computer, purchase a Targus card reader at Walmart for $8.88 or another brand for less at Ritz/Wolf/Kit camera.  Also, they do 3? x 5" digital prints for 6 each on Tuesday and Wednesday.     CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.     After you have the memory card plugged in, go to My Computer and open the memory card, select the picture you want to copy, and then copy to the My Pictures folder under My Documents under Documents and Settings.     If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore. Find and select the picture you want to copy and then at top left, click the X next to Folders to see a place to select Copy Files.  Now select the My Picture folder.  Make and select a sub folder then click Copy.        You can also copy from the computer to a memory card.      Have just been playing with this and found that it works really well, but you should first format the memory card in the camera because it adds files to the card you will need.     Next, take a picture of something with the camera.     Place the memory card in the card reader and go to My Computer.      Open the memory card and you should see a folder on the left (DCIM) that has your picture. Do not open the MISC folder on the right.     Double Click on the DCIM folder and you should see another folder e.g.,100HPM417, which includes the name of your camera.  Double Click on that folder and you should see the picture you just took.     When you copy from the computer to a memory card, that is the folder where your pictures must be copied. You may only be able to copy one picture at a time.     One last thing, the file names of your pictures must not have any additional letters or those pictures will not be seen by the camera.  Also, the file name format must match the file name of the picture you took e.g., HPIM1903.  Rename files to the same format as your camera photos.     If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore. Find and select the pictures you want to copy and then near the top left, click the X next to Folders to see a place to select Copy files. You can then select the memory card folder e.g.,100HPM417, that you clicked to see the picture you took and click Copy.

9mTctb7jaa	VHF 2 way and to a lesser extent UHF 2 way frequencies are shared with multiple users. To keep your radio quiet when the channel is being used by others the ctcss keeps unwanted traffic out. When there is a call for you, it will have the ctcss on it to open the squelch on your receiver.  Also 2 way radio that is connected through a remote "repeater" radio use the ctcss to "open" the repeater. This helps keep the repeater from falsing do to other traffic on the channel.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	A CTCSS tone is an audio signal at a certain frequency that is below the audible frequencies that the radio puts out on the speaker.    A transmitting and receiving pair of 2-way radios have been set up to communicate only when that tone is present. When the receiving radio detects the wrong CTCSS tone, it squelches the incoming signal so that the receiving radio doesn't put out that transmitted audio. If the correct CTCSS signal is received, the receiver operates normally and you can hear the transmission.    So, if there are a bunch of radios operating on the same frequency, only the receivers that are set up with the correct CTCSS signal will put out the audio.     For example, let's say there are two companies - Company A and Company B - that have a radio dispatch system and they share the same transmission frequency. And, they have their radios set up with different CTCSS tones. When Company A transmits on the radio, Company B's radios won't put out the audio. But, a light comes on saying that the frequency is in use (the radio still picks up the transmission - it just doesn't put out the audio). When Company A is through using the radio, Company B can transmit and Company A's radios won't put out the audio.    But, CTCSS doesn't have anything to do with the transmit frequency. It's just an audio signal that gets transmitted with the regular audio.|`|wQiGnJepaa	It does not interfere with anything unless you're listening to voice communications with a high-fidelity radio, then you'll hear a continuous low pitch tone.    Receivers are designed to ignore any signals except those which are on the correct radio frequency (they all do that), and also the audio on the signal must have the correct CTCSS tone, otherwise the receiver stays silent.

j5Apt8hWaa	You need to remember to use the shutter speed to adjust the UE, NE and OE shots otherwise you will get shifts in depth of field if you use the aperture to make the exposure adjustments.  EV or Exposure Value is something photographers know and a lot of the time they use photo jargon that is assumed every one knows.  Most people coming from P&S cameras do not unless they have 1) had a few classes in photography or 2) have been using 35 mm SLR's or other film camera in the past.  EV is but one of those terms you will run into from time to time.    BTW there are very few "secrets" in photography ... the only ones I know have to do with processing black and white film or printing black and white prints ... and even those are not "secrets", they are just things you don't learn unless you hang with a darkroom wizard or attend one of the top photo schools in the world|`|0AqkCOWIaa	As you probably know, you do not shoot HDRs, you create them in an editor, a good one is Photomatix by the way, if you don't have an editor already. You do, however, shoot the components of the HDR with the camera. You need one over one normal, and one over, at least that's my technique, and it's been working so far. When you look through the viewfinder, you will see a scale. You need it to the far left for over-exposed shots, the center for Correct exposures, and the far right to over-exposed. You can change it in the TV mode ( use f/22 ).    There should be a button on your camera near the shutter release that shows a +/- sign. You click that button, and use the thumb dial to change it. Use +2 and -2. Hopefully you understand.|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	You can set the camera to manual and shoot +1, +2, -1 and -2 stops manually. Or you can use exposure compensation (p. 54 of your manual).|`|eVptHOOBaa	Yes, page 54 of your manual is where you can read about EV, and set it to several settings, however there is a more convenient option available on your D80, it's called "bracketing", which is technically the same adjusting of EV up and down, but instead of you having to do this manually, your camera will do it for you, so you'll be taking three shots in a row - a correctly exposed shot, under exposed and over exposed without a need to adjust for each shot manually. This way you will have a smaller chance that something moved while you were taking the picture, or to move your camera while re-adjusting settings.     Page 56 of your manual has the details on bracketing, but also make sure that you go to the settings menu and set it to AE mode for bracketing, so that it changes exposure for each shot (page 90 of the manual).     I think it is also worth mentioning, that you need to shoot in "P" mode (to begin with), because in "auto" EV or bracketing options may not work for you.    LEM.|`|HFuI8oVYaa	On the D80, I see three ways of doing this.    Manual Mode: Doing your exposure bracketing using manual mode is the preferred method since your camera's auto-exposure system probably won't work well in situations where HDRI is used. Adjust your shutter speed to change exposure. Do not change f-stop as that will create depth of field focus differences between your shots. Figure out what f-stop you want to use, adjust your shutter speed to correctly expose the brightest object. You can check for overexposed areas using the highlight viewing mode (pg 63 in the manual). The histogram mode is unreliable because it is some mysterious combination of the RGB channels which means one of the colors may be overexposed even though the histogram shows that exposure is OK.   Take additional images using longer shutter speeds until you dark areas are correctly exposed. I find that 1.33-stops or less works well between exposures.    Bracket Mode (pg 56 in manual). You can set your camera to bracket three or two shots. You probably need to use this in conjunction with exposure compensation (pg 54) to offset your bracketing since the 3 shot bracketing only does +/- bracketing.     EV compensation mode (pg 54 in manual): With your camera set in aperture priority mode, you can use the exposure compensation feature. This is a difficult way of making a HDRI set as you will be fighting the automatic features of the camera.    General Notes:  1. Disable the ISOauto feature (pg 88 in manual). I don't know if they did this in the D80, but the ISOauto feature is enabled when you switch the camera to manual mode in some of Nikon's DSLRs. Be sure to enable ISOauto after your shoot.    2. Shoot at a low ISO like 100 to maximize dynamic range and best noise performance. ISO 200 on the D80 will produce good results.    3. Although you can use JPEG images for HDRI, it is recommended that you use RAW format. RAW format allows you to use linear contrast images instead of images with a warped contrast curve. For your first experiments, use JPEG so you can get used to using the program(s) without spending a lot of time dealing with RAW workflow. When you do your real shots, use RAW and linear processing.    4. EV steps of 1.33 stops or less works well. Anything over 1.33 stops starts to degrade the process.    5. You need a decent tripod.     6. Use a remote shutter release to minimize camera shake. The act of pressing the shutter release will cause the camera to shake. If you don't have a remote, you can use the self timer feature set to 2 seconds.    7. Best to set your focus on manual once you focus on your subject. You don't want your camera to pick different focus spots while shooting the stack.    8. HDRI programs vary in quality. You can get quality HDRI programs for free. The pay versions probably are easier to use. The older style tone mapping used by programs such a qtpfsgui are used if you want weird coloration HDRI (looks ugly usually). If you want shots that look natural, use enfuse or tufuse. You will also need to align all your images in the stack so they overlay perfectly (you will have slight image alignment issues unless you use a really solid camera mount system). align_image_stack is a wonderful program.    You can get enfuse and align_image_stack from the Hugin panorama installation. These are free.  http://hugin.sourceforge.net/    You can get tufuse free at:  http://www.tawbaware.com/tufuse.htm  You will still need align_image_stack from the Hugin package to align your images.    To convert your RAW images to linear 16-bit TIFF files, use dcraw.  http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/  There are builds for Mac and Windows. See the FAQ section for links.    9. Your work flow is:    1. Take pictures.    2. Convert to linear 16-bit TIFF using dcraw.    3. Align images using align_image_stack if required.    4. Tone map using enfuse or tufuse.    5. In a good image editor, such as Photoshop or The Gimp,        adjust contrast to your liking using levels and/or curves.    6. Convert your 16-bit TIFF to a JPEG so you can share it.    Some silly experiments I've done with HDRI:  http://picasaweb.google.com/qrkpub/HDRIE...

f75d7710b2088b9f9cd634bb910c6fdaaa	First, take a deep breath...Relaxed? Good! You need a program to move your music and videos from your computer to your PSP. I swear by this program. It's very easy to use and you can find it for free on the Internet. It's called PSP Max Media Manager. All you need is a USB cable to connect your PSP to your computer and start moving files. Make sure you got enough memory. One Gig is good but two is better. Music and Videos love memory so the more you have the better. Need more help? Just ask! Good Luck!|`|EZCrzQwBaa	download the video that you want on to your pc. then convert the video to mp4 using these two programs.     i recommend downloading both of these converters. i tried many converters and only these two satisfy me. im serious. all the others on the internet suck so bad. it's not even funny.    both of these programs are freeware, so don't worry about buying anything.    http://www.divx-digest.com/software/3gp_...      i use this for avi videos files and movies.its so easy to use and really fast compared to the other sucky converters out there.    -download the program. there is no need to install.  -save the folder in your local disk.  -open the folder, then double click on setup.  -change the language to ENGLISH.  -configure it to MODEL: MP4, FOR PSP (DIRECT, RENAME).  -change you output directory by clicking BROWSE. (i save my videos on my desktop)  -change your quaility of the video by clicking the dropbox.  -drag and drop the video(s) into the box.  -after it is finished converting, take the two files (example: MV243313789 and MV243313789.thm) and place them in your F:\MP_ROOT\100MNV01 folder.    *Tips:  If there isn's a F:\MP_ROOT\100MNV01 folder, make one.  For my video quailities, i usually chose the second option (QVGA15fps/216kbps/ stereo/96kbps) because the converter video is not that much of big file.  Usually a 5 minute file would be 10mb.     http://www.winnydows.com/xvid4psp.html    this one is not as fast as 3pg, but i love it. i use this one for music videos, because you can crop the videos.    -download and install the program.  -run the program. (it might take a couple of seconds)  -OPEN the video you want.  -The video will start to play in a pop up window.   -CROP the video to your satisfation, but you don't have to.  -when your done, click OK.  -on this pop up screen, make sure the format is on MP4 PSP 3.30. change your bitrate to what you want. (the higher, the better quaility, but the more memory space). i usually go with 288kbps. i think its perfect.  -if you want your video to be WIDESCREEN, change the resolution of the video to 480x272.  -click ok.  -you can now open more videos to convert (repeat the steps listed above).  -change your SAVE FOLDER at the bottom part.  -once your finish cropping and your ready to convert, click start.  -after it is finished converting, place the two files (example: Rush and Rush.jpeg) in F:\VIDEO folder.     Tips:  if you don't have a F:\Video folder, make one.  if you are converting a movie, it might take a longgg time. for videos that last 5 minutes, it might take 10 minutes to convert. This is why i gave you two converters.|`|Rm1FgWyDaa	Cucusoft PSP Video Converter + DVD to PSP Converter Suite is a good choice , it is powerful , just download it at http://www.oursdownload.com/PSP-Video-Co...

As apple has removed the DRM  form its music it is rumoured that the next software update will release the MMS and bluetooth to allow for file sharing that's currently blocked.    to share files you must use the WIFI in the iphone with a computer and use a file app such as Filemagnet via the apps store in itunes store inside itunes|`|kiJUCYMcaa	i think with iphone there is no bluetooth|`|AA11256390	It has Bluetooth but you can only use it with a Bluetooth headeset and nothing else.

nQ7G1nBVaa	A podcast (or netcast if you will) is a way to distribute audio or video programs on the internet in a "push" type system, to a subscribers computer.<br>  <br>  It works by having a server on the internet that hosts the individual media files. Also is what is called an RSS feed, which is basically a file on a website that has a list of the media files available. As a netcaster publishes an episode of their program, they put the media file onto a server, and add the new program to the RSS file.<br>  <br>  As a user, you load the URL off the RSS file into your Podcast program, which iTunes is. The program will occasionally download and check the RSS file for new episodes, and if instructed download new ones.<br>  <br>  The short way, is to subscribe to podcasts through iTunes (there typically is no cost), or manually add the RSS address to iTunes (in the advanced tab).

Just hit the xbox button and select recover gamertag.     I don't know how to change your profile name.    Edit:  It should be fine to recover your tag and change your profile name with a dead email.  It doesn't send confirmation to your email account.  Just type it in the same you did 2 years ago.    Modding the box isn't illegal, but microsoft maintains the right to cancel your live account if you do.

JX3Q1AWkaa	Your two most important sound ranges are going to be BASS and TREBLE.  You want to put together a speaker system that has good high frequency response as well as a large subwoofer that can really pound.  Don't worry bout the midrange to much.  Also, in the end it is how you calibrate your setup to suit your wants and needs.  Check out Polk Audio.  They have an expansive line of speakers that really sound sharp. Check out there reference series.  Also, take a look at Denon receivers.  Stay away from Home Theater In a Box.  You will be sorely dissapointed.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Music is recorded in 2 channels.  Surround sound is usually found in movie soundtracks.  That said, your sound system can do both.  If you want a good surround system for movies and music I suggest you assemble your speakers individually, getting some really beefy fronts and sub.|`|Ec4YjJxGaa	I agree with whoami Polk makes excellent speakers for both music and surround. and Denon makes excellent receivers you may be able to get an excellent receiver from Onkyo for less money than the Denon , but a lot of it is personal preference. other speakers to look into are the Infinity's and Klipsch but like whoami I prefer the Polk Audio's..I have Boston Acoustic speakers myself but they may be a little pricey for you..check them out though as they have some new lines...
AA11043599	I guess not, stuff like that usually has some hidden charges|`|AA11124184	its most likely a scam to get your number|`|AA11635912	with my experiences, the ringtones might not work on ALL phone models. like mine, i've got virgin mobile. with my carrier, i can't any free ringtones. but to answer your question, more than likely (if it's a pop-up on your computer) it;s a scam or a trojan that will get in on your computer.
AA12174925	tendras que tener el ITUNES de apple (solo que no especificaste si queras bajar msica de Internet o tenes cds para escuchar) Si es la primera opcin (bajar msica de Internet) seria mejor entrar a la solapa "MUSIC STORE" ( es un servicio pago) de ah hacer la bsqueda de un tema determinado.  En el ITUNES 6 te da la oportunidad de importar los temas de cds para que puedas escucharlos en tu ipod. Solo debes insertar el cd que quieres importar los temas, adems de que los reconoce el programa y los agrega a la biblioteca, en ese momento los podes importar para usar en tu Ipod. Espero que te haya sido til, leelo con mucha atencin para no cometer errores. Adems te dejo la direccin donde saque toda la data.

AA12174925	lo que te recomiendo es ir a la tienda mas cercana y comprar un cable usb genrico para tu reproductor ya que (posiblemente) pueda no ser compatible el cable aunque venga con el equipo. puede que el puerto usb de la compu de escritorio no sea compatible con el reproductor.Es otra posibilidad. Como no dijisteis que sistema operativo tienes no te puedo dar mas datos. Si tienes windows XP te lo tendra que reconocer al toque. Sino anda a   panel de control  agregar nuevo hadware.   Se te va a abrir un wizard (asistente) que te va a llevar por los pasos para reconocerlo.  si tenes el disco con los drivers para el IQ tenelos a mano.  Si aun as no te lo reconoce es que no es compatible con los puertos usb de tu computadora...
LB9TPDWGaa	depends on what kind it is. most probably in the main folder, where the .exe is.
P1jBltbIaa	If I understand the question, you want to put the back cover on, right? It is a bit different.    Lay the back cover on the back with the little "ears" extended above the top of the phone. Press and slide it down until it clicks into place. The little "ears" will align on each side of the release button.    I work at Motorola some reply back if this isn't working for you. There's a diagram of how take the cover off at the URL below, so that may help. Good luck!
GZfzVRykaa	you sound like a smart person so i wont bore u, obviously electronics and water don't mix, try holding down the play and middle button down to see if it turns on...depending on what ipod you have. if that doesnt work it honestly isnt worth getting it repaired....ipods are getting cheaper and cheaper....for the time ur without it and the price, which im not 100% sure of id just buy a new one......    if ur strapped for cash then take it into an apple shop which u can find on the internet and get a quote to fix it or replace it    hope this helped mate
Ff3eP90Kaa	Halogen heaters provide instant heat that warms up the room fairly quickly. They are very cheap to run compared to regular heaters. (We have two halogen heaters and they are 800w each). Disadvantages are that the heat is instant, so when they are turned off, the room cools quickly and they produce a glow.  Convection heaters provide a slower heat and are supposed to warm the room through so that they remain warm even when switched off. They use a lot more electricity though, usually aound 1.5-3 Kw.  We had an oil heater but find the halogen cheaper to run and more effective. Plus it was very cheap to buy in the first place. (About 6), the oil heater cost around 30.  Based on experience I would go for Halogen in your case.|`|0494d957cdc898138da2648f6185a57eaa	I live in the mountains of PA and use an Endenpure electric heater it does the job and is very safe to use so if you want the best get an Edenpure heater.|`|Qa6lovZ6aa	I have a small 3KW electric convector fan.

1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	ok, it looks, good but there was only one issue i had with it. but it's a significant issue. if you look at the spec's for the lens it says, (digital zoom). not good. (optical zoom) is the way to go. people see, 10 or 12mp. the industry knows how consumers are judging their cameras. 10mp dose'nt neccasarily make it good if it's a D-zoom. digital zoom crops the image in the camera, so when you go to view it "noise" shows up. optical zoom, actually zooms in on the subject.    my advice is look at reviews of cameras in the same price range. dpreview.com has rigerous reviews of almost any camera. and there's others on the net. canon and nikon lead the market and they have for a long time. do'nt follow the herd. that's my expierence. rmember, get a camera with (optical zoom) and do'nt be too concerned about mp's 6 or 8 used to be fine until they got on the megapixel race.|`|f03976a153802da6a244397db068fdeaaa	i like it!|`|88RywTdCaa	The looks are awesome yaar....!! Even i was searching for a good camera... but i think the only place where it falls behind most other cameras is the zoom... 3x optical zoom is too less if you want great photos... but i think its a good choice if you are not gonna need it!! 10.1  MP is actually great!!|`|RCbtRF4xaa	- Metal body construction   - Manual control features   (Full shutter speed control and somewhat limited F stop control)   - Innovative interfaces   - Classic outlook   - Battery charge with USB cable   - Portability (Fits well in a pocket)     Good deal from Amazon  http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Digimax-NV...|`|ma0LU0JCaa	I don't recommend Samsung products. Instead, go for Canon, Olympus, or Sony. Till this date all the products I've got of Samsung has some problems, excluding my Samsung monitor.    And, isn't 3X optical zoom so less. Go for at least 5X optical zoom when the camera is over 10 megapix.|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	From your link I do not see how much camera is. So, I suggest in your price range buy a Canon.

JILkhKjJaa	You have the first iPhone with the black strip on the back thatmeans you need to register or jailbreak your iPhone to jailbreak look it up on YouTube or google cuz I am not going to tell you but that is the only ways to stop that problem cuz I had the same prob then I registered then I got the 3g and I jaulbroke it and that worked to then u bought another 3g and left it as is and nothing hppend so I guess you got one of the bad iPhones that realy sucks I would take it back and just get. A new one

khEBsWevaa	well, you can get apps for free, i take it you have cydia. if you dont, get it from installer before proceeding. open it up and down at the bottom click managment. now up at the top click edit then add.    type   cydia.hackulo.us   and press add. now goto sections and then appulo.us and download the installous, and if you have the firmware, the 2.2.1 update.  click search while still in cydia and download something called safari download or something you will know it when you see it.  now open installous and click search. typ in keywords for an app you want. when it loads, click. scroll way down and tap the newest version. the page will scroll back up and the flash over to a list of download sites. try for ipod friendly ones. click on and find the download link, then press download. DO NOT PRESS INSTALL, PRESS DOWNLOAD!!! wait till it is done downloading, then at the bottom where it says downloads, click there then on your app and press install. once it seems like it is done, check up at the top and see if the loading circle is still spinning. do not exit untill it goes away.  also, you have to have at least one official app from the app store, be it free or paid, before the apps you download will actually be able to find the apps folder. i wouldnt want to promote piracey so after you are done "trying" the app, decide wether you want to buy it, then delete it.  that is what installous is for is so people can try apps before they buy them ; Pyou can also download winterboard, or is it winter board idk but that allows you to put themes on your ipod. goto sections then themes full and pick out one, then launch the winterboard app and check off the theme. press home and the ipod will load abit, then you will need to slide to unlock and viola: custom themes. you can also download different little things like custom keyboards or slide bars to litteraly make your own theme.  hope i helped : )

wCa3IYcVaa	both are very good mp3 players, they are relatively around the same cost per gb and they hold alot of music, movies, tv shows, etc... The ipod is more popular than the zune because it's been out longer and everyone whos had an ipod has loved it and wont switch. I would suggest an ipod because they are very simple to use, there are endless amounts of accesories for them, and if you decide to go with the ipod touch, there are endless amounts of applications. also the ipods are synced through itunes which is very user friendly and a great media manager.|`|DxoodgOtaa	zune and ipod are both amazing. i think both are really good. but zune is a lot less complicated than itunes.|`|kbouBTxvaa	iPod- Better apps and wider compatibility with other music systems.|`|aH3vvUfiaa	iPod is better.

zGrAwlQfaa	Your iPod didnt break, it just encountered an error. All you have to do is go to iTunes, and click on the tab that has your iPod on it (you know, the summary). It will say check for update, and under that, it will say restore. Just click restore, and it will fix your iPod. The restore might take a while, but trust me, it will be worth it. Oh, and it wont erase anything off of your iPod. All you had to do before that to prevent them getting erased is backing your iPod up, but dont worry. Your computer does that automatically anyway.|`|wPbJgcUIaa	currupt means that the software has crashed.

Maybe it says it's an MP4 file format, but it isn't encoded right.<br>   Try converting it again, to MP4. That  sometimes works for me.<br>  <br>  Download a video file converter such as Videora. This got pretty good reviews.<br>  <a href="http://www.videora.com/en-us/Converter/iPod/" rel="nofollow">http://www.videora.com/en-us/Converter/i...</a><br>  <br>  Make sure  you choose MP4 format, and try importing it again.<br>  <br>  If you need further help, feel free to contact me.|`|2qGN0uEMaa	I have the same problem sometimes.  I forget how I got it to work, although Im pretty sure, once its in the right format (which SHOULD be mpeg4), I just clicked file>add file to library> then selected the movie that I wanted to put in.
kL6amV8gaa	Omnia...Windows Mobile has more apps and the phone has more features.  I took the Storm back because I hated it and got the Omnia.  I hated the clicking screen and the fact that I could only switch from landscape to portrait  on certain screens while running certain apps.  The Omnia allows you to transition the screen when ever you want with just the turn of the phone...u could be sending a text, making a call or browsing the internet...it doesn't matter.  Also the Blackberry is very laggy in it's transition from landscape to portrait and vice versa.  The Omnia will only give you that problem when your running a lot of programs...and it does take alot of programs to make the transition laggy.  I would go with the Omnia.  The Omnia is verizon's best selling phone as of now and the Storm is the most commonly returned phone...that's what the VZW Rep told me when I returned my BB and switched to teh Omnia.|`|0wbaC9PWaa	If you want a more complicated/high tech phone I would pick the omnia, but if you want a more simple/easy to use phone i would pick the storm.|`|ze9eiwlmaa	get the omnia better touch screen
Hq9ylshWaa	Not really. the I-phone runs off Apple software and the I-900 uses Microsoft. Think of it like the differences between a PC and a mac. Probably best to avoid Samsung atm the newest ones like the Tocco and the Omnia have trouble getting signal.|`|kL6amV8gaa	Yes and No.  The Iphone has a better touch pad and a more colorful screen but the Omnia (IMO) has more features.  The Omnia does just about everything that the Iphone does plus it has Mobile Office for viewing and creating Powerpoint, Word, Excel, and OneNote documents.  It also has an expandable SD slot which is expandable to 16gb as of now, which the Iphone lacks.  The Omnia (for Verizon) comes with 8gb built in memory.  The I-phone comes with 8 or 16gb.  But the Omnia is capable of having more memory due to the SD slot.  The Omnia has a anytime rotating screen...no matter if you're sending a text or browsing the internet you can rotate the screen at ANYTIME.  The Iphone is basically the same with the rotating screen but you can only text one way...vertical.  Personally I look at the Omnia as the Iphone's bigger brother.  And whoever said the Omnia doesn't get good service is crazy...it's a Verizon phone.  I don't know of a verizon phone with bad service.|`|vzg5r7DOaa	yes, it is similar to the iphone, but the samsung omnia is from verizon wireless and the iphone is from at & t. Other than that, this phone is very similar to the iphone. go to phonescoop.com and you can compare the 2 phones. GOOD LUCK, I MIGHT GET THIS KIND OF PHONE ALSO.
mZBctgn8aa	its great, because if there is anything wrong with it you can take it in and they will hand you a new one. so you can save about $100 so i say go for it!|`|KNYF1hnhaa	That depends on who you get the refurb from.<br>  <br>  If you get it from Apple, it has been assigned a new serial number and has a full 1 year warranty and 90 days phone support.<br>  <br>  If you get it from AT&T it could be a preowned phone meaning that it will just have the remainder of the warranty/phone support if any was left.|`|YAYq0FnNaa	Great deal, its less money and guaranteed to work, if it doesn't just return it.
0wbaC9PWaa	If you have the music on your sd card then you should just go to the music section of your phone and it should be right there. (Make sure you put the sd card into your phone)
0wbaC9PWaa	If you want to transfer pics from your computer to your phone you should just put the pictures onto your email and send them to your phone.
H5FE4xZxaa	The enV 2 would probably be your best choice. It has normal buttons and it flips open so you have more protection than you would an open touch screen phone.  If you have large fingers you might have difficultly texting on the Dare becaue it is sort of smaller and all touch screen. Also, if you had the Env and loved it, the the enV 2 is similar, just updated with some slight changes. The enV 2 will be easier to use, especially for texting.|`|gmZLGuNtaa	how about the voyager....??????<br>  <br>  the buttons are pretty big for texting...<br>  <br>  i've had it for a year and a half...practically got it when it came out<br>  <br>  and well its great...i could upgrade to any phone but i dont see myself without the voyager...<br>  <br>  <br>  but if this is not an option....<br>  <br>  <br>  go for the env2, its still cool...and the dare is a bit small...|`|Sf9Ucn95aa	I think it would be best to get a env2 the because you like the regular env so I think you will like the env2 even better it is a cool phone alot of my friends have the env2 and they love it and I think I might want one myself|`|vzg5r7DOaa	LG DARE ALL THE WAYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

DbfQuKeeaa	Scoop vs. Razor?<br>  Get the scoop if you are a big texting freak (its okay. I am a texting freak too). Yeah there may be a few problems but what phone doesn't have a little problem every now and then?|`|jRRTdT4uaa	you should get the scoop because it has a full qwerty keyboard, it is newer and the phone does have a few problems but every phone has some sort of promblem there is no phone out there that has no problems
yVMGqyIwaa	the music file could not be found<br>  either locate it OR create it again
Hq9ylshWaa	The 5610, 5800 and the N96, which is suprising considering how much the N95 sucked. Most Nokias are okay but avoid the 6500 at all costs- massive technical issues.|`|LrD0lxGDaa	........|¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨.....<br>  ........|..........2 points ..........|||"|""\__<br>  ........|__________________|||_|___|)<<br>  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|mgM1Ot3Oaa	<a href="http://news.softpedia.com/images/news2/Nokia-6205-For-Verizon-Unveiled-2.png" rel="nofollow">http://news.softpedia.com/images/news2/N...</a>|`|X3sACBu4aa	i have a nokia 5310 pink && i LOVE it. its a really good phone, its been dropped countless times and dropped in water and it still works|`|DbfQuKeeaa	I don't really like nokia phones.<br>  And I also don't like how you name is VERY similar to mine.|`|cSNBibQeaa	actually wat all do u need for ur phone??|`|3PiIh7Qiaa	my personal favorite is the N96 but thats me.<br>  it really depends on what kind of phone you are looking for <br>  if you want a phone that is durable, high tech, with 8gigs then go with the N96 or N95<br>  if you want a tablet/touchscreen with mp3 then go with 5800<br>  <br>  but you can always check out what one might fit you at nokia.com|`|AjMjkCKraa	Nokia N73|`|1S9ZKgqVaa	Any nokia phone is great!<br>  i love nokias..
jRRTdT4uaa	The LG KP500 (Cookie) is a touchscreen phone for those on a budget. It's a compact device but with a large touchscreen display that's easy and fun to use. With a 3.2 megapixel camera, a media player, an FM radio, Bluetooth wireless connectivity and a memory card slot, this phone has all the essentials. Although it misses out on 3G and a top class camera, it has most features that most people will want, and for the money you'd be hard pressed to find anything better than this! Now available in Pink!<br>  So in conclusion, yes you should get it:)
AA12271834	No there isn't a universal WiFi backdoor password.  There are cracking tools out there that will let you bruit force your way into a WEP protected network (which is why I use AES encryption), but I'm not going to tell you where to find them.|`|qXvFsnOcaa	There is no universal back door, that is an urban myth.|`|oL93fpmnaa	Get a packet sniffer, and decrypt the WEP/WPA codes yourself. :)|`|jRRTdT4uaa	no sorry dude each WI FI has a differnt password, i know it sucks|`|duS5ozbQaa	no, but "admin" is always a good guess.
jRRTdT4uaa	take your phone to where you bought it at and then can telll you if it can be fixed or not, hope you can fix it:)
hWc65sEtaa	Just call someones land line phone.|`|bqisLny9aa	call your land line and leave the phone talking to it and leave. you'll drain the minutes without you talking on it i guess.<br>  <br>  ps don't do that if your expecting an important call.... lol|`|n8UBfhgpaa	Go on the web browser and download ring tones.|`|fnytzXWTaa	call a random number lol

Turn power off. Slide the battery<br>  cover off the phone by placing<br>  your thumb on the raised ledge<br>  and sliding it gently away from the<br>  phone, then lift and remove it.<br>  <br>  2.

Turn your phone upside down. Then just slide the back plate off. My phone's plate thing was tight at first but be careful taking it off. You may want to have them do it so you dont break it accidently. Good Luck!|`|jRRTdT4uaa	the user manuel that should have came with your phone will explain exactly how to do it:)

8XS7xeiXaa	my boyfriend & i both have the phone, & have dropped it several times & it's never broke.<br>  we text, & use the internet all day long & the battery never dies on us as long as we charge it at night. <br>  i personally love the phone.|`|jRRTdT4uaa	Pros: Large keyboard. Good price. GPS navigation and capable, mobile Web browser.  <br>  Cons: Interface looks very yesterday. Messaging options are limited, a real shame on an inexpensive QWERTY phone<br>  There are better phones out there but it is a pretty good phone i'd give it about a 3.5 out of 5
yVMGqyIwaa	restore it then email me and i will help u jailbreak it|`|jRRTdT4uaa	plug your phone in with the usb and reset your iphone and try to remove the apps and put them back on again:)|`|evdwOEXfaa	just turn your phone on and off
