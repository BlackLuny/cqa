If like most people you dont't have it, you can use a broom handle to turn it from the top. The vaccume idea is a good one too.|`|AA10753451	I wouldn't do it.

But you won't know if it grinds it or jams it until you try it.     I found some very long needle nose pliers to be handy in removing things from a disposer.|`|P4ICKZS5aa	If it breaks it & the disposal is still under warranty, the warranty will most likely not cover the damage that the glass caused.

The hepa is under that cover, blow it out with a air compressor first and then wash it. If it smells that bad i would probably replace it. They should be about 24.95 at your local vac shop.     If its not the DC07 or DC14, it should be located in at the top of the cup. take the cup off and there should be a tab on the top/front and the handle part will hight towards the back.

Green wood starts slower but burns longer - great for the last log of the night. Dry wood starts faster but burns up faster. We cut and use about 6 full cords a winter, since our wood stove is all we have and it gets to -30 or so. We use about 4 cords of dry and 2 cords of green every year.

Uhyu3iCbaa	Try mixing bleach and water in the spray bottle, if you have any, and spray it on them.  Sweep up the dead ants and wash their trails off with the same mixture.  If you keep doing this, they'll lose the scent and go away.     I worked in a day care and one of my kids left a leaking juice box in a garbage can over the weekend.  When I came back, the wall was covered in ants. We just had to keep cleaning them to get them to finally go away.|`|diQ0oodqaa	If you can see their trail on counters, at windows, etc. Sprinkle cinnamon across trails, they hate it and won't go thru or over it.|`|gjs1GXdTaa	I had this problem and it was  I had a bag of sugar spill in the cabinet.

Pour about 1/4 cup of baking soda down the drain.   Heat 2 cups of vinegar to a boil and pour it down the drain.   Pour it down about 1/4 cup at a time. Watch it bubble up and subside before pouring each 1/4 cup.   Keep the room vented. The gas released from the bubbles can make it difficult to breathe.     Another vinegar use is on floors. If you clean your floors with chemicals, give it a go-over with vinegar water. This will help remove chemical residue. You want to get rid of as much chemical residue as possible, especially if you have kids and/or pets walking over that floor.

346e6e2923d4e46195fcf8100cba96beaa	Ge water heaters are made by Rheem.    Rheem installed a glass bulb that breaks when the venting is not good. When the bulb breaks, it shuts the intake door and the heater will not get enough air to do it's job.    I know you do not want to hear this, but you'll need a licensed plumber like me to troubleshoot it and fix the reason the chamber heated up enough to break the bulb.    Now the good news!  Rheem will warranty the water heater. You may have to pay for a legal plumber, but at least the heater is free.    BTW, the bulb can be seen when the burner is pulled out.   If you don't see it, it's because it exploded, and is not there anymore.    Why do you get a new heater? Because Rheem (GE) does not make the bulb available for replacement.   They chose to replace the water heater to make sure all areas as far as what they are tied to, are covered.   Not a bad company huh.    Edit:  The last GE I went on,---the vent top was mashed down by a basketball and the heater couldn't vent. That heated up and broke the glass bulb that holds the air door open and stopped the heater from working effectively.    One last edit, then I'm off this question:  Other things than just the venting affects that glass bulb. If the air intake screen is clogged, that'll do it.|`|XQiH90x2aa	whats the brand , may be gas valve?|`|7b95f56f63ab0286d68690838f2404d6aa	Try this make shure the vent pipe is connected through the roof for a good drawl to keep enough oxygen to the burner.

mwDuaWTFaa	There isn't really such a thing as a 8" x 8" steel I-beam.  Steel beams are specified by type, depth (height) and weight per foot.  A W8X31 -- wide flange I beam, 8" deep, 31 lbs per foot -- is 8"deep and 7.995" wide, about as close as it gets.  It would cost about $35.00 per foot here, or about $735.  It will be more or less depending upon where you are at.    The bigger problem is you really need to figure out what size you need to solve your problem before you can tell how much it will cost.  You will need an engineer to give you specifications, at which time you can call some steel suppliers in your area to get an accurate cost.|`|fbb74ff00bf5ccffec646cf3e5a7c537aa	I think you'll have to call around to local sellers to get an idea.

Don't try to rotate it, you will only cause damage to the tree...unless it is in a pot, then you can rotate it if you want to.  But you should never have to rotate a tree.  Since it is an evergreen, you don't have to worry about it receiving a limited amount of sunlight.  It will grow, most pines and spruces are shade tolerant and do well in any condition.

Designers pricing varies greatly depending on how much assistance and time they are putting into the job.  Usually designers charge either per hour $50-100 or a flat rate on the job.

TL1Jkqunaa	The only thing that works is boric acid.  It takes time and persistence but usually you  can do the little bast*rds real damage in 3 days.  You also have to try to block their access if they are getting in from outside.   You have to put the powder down along the walls, making continuous lines so that the roaches can not avoid contact.  ANd lines around stoves, refrigerators and so on.  But it works even if it is annoying to try to clean the area daily without disturbing the boric acid.  Or putting down news lines of defense each time.    You may have to leave a line of acid around the house for a few days too.  Boric acid in bulk is very cheap and it is the active ingredient in most roach poisons at much higher prices.  Just buy the acid at a hardware store or art shop.  Pharmacies often have it too but usually in smaller packages, you probably should be using a pound or more if you have to lay a line around the house.    I live in the tropics (Central America) and spend a lot of time in field camps.  Boric acid is the only thing I have seen that makes a difference.  Make  sure it is the acid you buy not some other form of it.|`|TPPZp8IYaa	Mortein Cockroach Baits seem to be pretty effective.

4rYDpMAgaa	Batteries are sensitive to lower temperatures.    As the temperature drops, the battery voltage also drops.  When the voltage drops below a certain level the Smoke alarm will detect the low voltage and warn you your battery needs replacing even if it does not.    If you live in an area where heating is required, smoke alarms double a good warning for furnace failure.    If you place a brand new battery in the smoke alarm and the temperature drops low enough, the same thing will occur.    The batteries used in smoke alarms operate at their optimal performance at room temperature which they were designed.

vl6OtBfWaa	I am a renovation contractor I will answer your questions but I have one for you first how did you get the job to paint 10 condo's?      A power sprayer creates a lot of overspray you will have to mask and cover every other surface in the condo's if they are new and have no carpet or tile or doors or cabinets or anything like that you can spray just mask the windows     If the condos are not empty and have finished surfaces you are better to use a brush and roller.  a good painter can do a hell of a lot of painting in a day.    Enamel is an oil based paint used motly in kitchens bathrooms and sometimes woodd trim it is highly shiiny and resistant it stinks like hell and is rare to use these days enamel or very high gloss finishes are very out of style now.    Acrylic can best be described as a pastic type paint many of the same properties as enamel but based on less harsh chemicals.  Used mostly on high wear surfaces.    latex paints are water based easy to cean up easy to apply and cosst effective.    The latex is the best product for you Ceilings are usually fflat finish oor specific eiling paint wal can be any finish but a sligtly shiny finish will wash easie and last longer trim and kitchens bathroms can be gloss finish to repel humidity.    But nowdays paint finish is a matter of taste.    I dont tape get a god angle brush for places where precise cutting is necssary like around windows or doors . Angle brushes are expensive but belieeve me they pay for themselves fast.   The time it takes to paint is better spent learnng proper brush control and cutting.     And with latex paints water clean up is easy.    If you use the sinks in the condos to rinse your brushes make sure you leave no paint residue in the stainless stee sinks it will leave marks if not cleaned.    If the paint is dry you are out of luck.    Yoou can wrap brushesina plastic bag and put them in a refrigerator for several days and the brush will still be useable.  if ou paint the same color on several days this saves a lot of clean-up.        **Read  carefully  Do not go cheap on your paint dont try to cut corners on materials you will regret it Behr paint is not expensive pay the price and you will havebette qualityy and no customers refusing to pay.    A 1000 sq foot empty condo 1 coat 1 color is 1 days work.  But that is after yeas of practice take your time onthe firstt one By the time you get to number 10 you will be an expert.    I cannot stress this enough painting itself is not difficult the urge to cut corners go fast make more money that is hard to resist.  esist those urgges take your time dont f*** around do the first one learn from it you will gt faster and better on each one by the time you are one you will be amazed at your progres and the difference in quality from 1 to 10.    Buy good brushes and clean them always have rags and plastic near by and garbage bags     Prepp and planning make good results.

The male threaded opening in the valve should be 3/8", so you would need to remove the copper tubing, the flare fitting from the valve, and install a new fitting, a 3/8" male pipe on one end and a 3/8" compression opening on the other.  That's the end the new hose should screw onto.

1guy337Taa	hello , the width of your footer depends on if you plan on bricking your home. avg 12 inches to 14 wide if you arent and 16 to 18 if you are, i imagine the county has codes. and at least 12 inches deep. call the concrete plant and tell them you have footers 65 feet long, 14 inches wide and 16 inches thick. keep in mind you will have to have step down in the footers if there is more than an 8 inch fall in your land. check your county code for the amount of rebar you should put, if no code , i would suggest 2 pieces of half inch . remember the top of the concrete in the footer should be no closer to 9 inches to your final foundation grade string. good luck|`|4fc35242b5828ca1664e6219c27f8f25aa	Of course it will depend on the weight of the what you want the footings to support and how much rebar you'll be using. Pouring footings is really cheap, when compared to repairing failed foundations, so I'd go with 18" - to be safe/sure. I've put in a link to how to compute concrete use - hope it helps.|`|ZpDvYoakaa	Get a couple trucks and just start pouring. Watch for rain.|`|AA11618316	A 18"X18" footing will require approx 11 cubic yards of concrete.  A 12"X12" footing will require approx. 5 cubic yards of concrete.  A 12"X18" footing will require approx. 7.3 cubic yards of concrete.  For example:- !.5 X 1.5 X 130 =292.5 cubic feet or 10.83 Cubic yards.
9d8438febeda9f081685c3c773c13d90aa	It's a great decision to buy a front loader..They use 1/3 the water so you also use 1/3 the detergent etc...Yes you have to use High Efficiency, but you use 1/3 less..Also, think about all the crap we put in our waterways from doing laundry etc..Wouldn't you like to add less pollution ?  They spin out almost twice as fast as a top loader, so you're cutting your drying time almost in half even if you keep your same dryer..Your dryer is pulling down 30 amps !  Whirlpool is good so is Maytag...LG makes a very good lower priced one but the best in my opinion is Samsung...They have at least two models with an option called "silver care"...It comeplety iliminates viruses, mold, bacteria, alergens, all without the use of heat or bleach..  Go to different retaier web sites and and check out the actual customer ratings...That's the best way to get a LOT of different personal opnions..Good luck and I hope you do buy a front load.. :-)|`|NuvKPl3naa	i have a 4.0 and i put a set ok king sheets and a king blanket in mine and it was too big. honestly i just got our front loader and i wish i kept the top loader. there is positive and negitive to both washers just do the pros and cons and pick what works for you. if you do large loads i would go with a larger washer|`|2OBP8fqJaa	If you are considering purchsing a front loader, you will have more things to consider such as wiping down the door seals once a month with bleach water solution to avoid mildew. And leaving the door ajar to prevent ths since they seal so tightly. Also, you will have to purchase the more expensive HE (High Efficiency) Detergent since normal detergnts are higher in suds and will cause error issues and slow drain in the hoses.     3.5 is HUGE. Most front loaders are around 3.1.    That's all I can tell you, but the more bells and whistles you get, the more issues you may have to contend with. You may want to consider getting an extended warranty after the frst year. Read a Users Guide/Manual before you buy one just to see some of the things you will have to keep up with.    I can't give any advice on Fridgidaire, but Maytag and Whirlpool are good suggestions and their customer service is great.|`|KVHYXILkaa	+1 for Whirlpool or Samsung. Frigidaire doesn't have the best service or product.

Mix equal parts of the white vinegar and oil and put them into a pump-spray bottle. You may want to swirl the bottle around just a little every few minutes to insure that everything is mixed properly. As with any chemical mixture, if you plan on keeping it in the spray bottle, you should label it. It will help you know what you are using later, and it should also prevent other people using it for something else.    Once you have the mixture in a spray bottle, just squirt a little over the hardwood floor and rub it with a cotton rag. A wax applicator will also work well for rubbing the mixture into the floor. Make sure you cover your whole floor, but you probably only want to do a section at a time, just to make sure you get all of the mixture rubbed in. If there is any leftover solution, make sure to wipe it up with a clean cloth. Then buff your floor until it is back to its original glow.|`|AA10520442	Wax paper.  For serious!

YY24gmRpaa	I totally agree with Jem.  Document everything, and then starting with the apartment manager, request that the situation be resolved.  If he/she refuses to take action contact his boss.  Follow this line until it runs out and you have no one higher to contact.  Then start with the health department and then the media if necessary. Make sure you document everything and send copies to the manager and his boss at every step.  Whether or not this is mold, it is a situation that needs to be fixed.|`|UQWusO1waa	I just had to say, Jem is a moron and has no idea what it is talking about.

They only semi-icky mold is black mold and you say it is blue?  Plus, if it was mold at all, the KILZ (if that's what they used) would not soak through.  With that being said, the smell is most likely the carpet.  Especially if you say it smells like cat urine.  If a cat pees on the carpet, you cannot get rid of the smell unless you remove the old carpet and padding and use a chemical on the concrete to get rid of the smell.  You can ask to transfer to another apartment if you really have a problem, but it sound like you are not in a decent complex if you are having these problems.  Calling a health inspector won't do anything either.  If you really have a problem, contact the manager and talk to them.

THEN you can threaten the corporate office or the leasing office if need be with reporting it to the health department and the better business bureau as well as the media if need be.

All deodorizers just mask the problem.    Is it in your carpets, or curtains?    If yes, you need to have them cleaned.    If you just want to get an odor out, such as cooking smell, or smoke, you should use first a can of spray such as Oust, then use a plug in type like Glade, Airwick and many other brands out there.    You can also use a candle warmer and place your favorite smell of candle on that (glass of course) and you will have a continuous smell throughout the day.    I prefer Glade candles.

Potable water piping is just your household water supply piping that brings your water to your faucets and such, they used to think that using solder with lead in it won't affect the drinking water supply enough to be harmful, and it was hard to find any thing else to use for solder back in the day anyway.  Now they have found that it is very harmful and they have developed many types of solder.  They all should say what they are composed of right on the side of the roll.
831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Well Ma'am this is what I did. I wanted to put in pavers but, the price forbid it. I saw a article on adobe the Mexicans were making out of mud so, I thought why not cement. I ended up after two years making 1300 bricks and two hundred feet of sidewalk and six small patios out of the forms I made for the cement.         I made the forms out of wood and the size i wanted, I did make some the were two inches thick and twenty inches wide for certain areas, you can take the forms off right away and let the bricks dry for a day in the sun. It worked out beautiful.          I'm going to make more slabs this summer twenty inches square and put in colored glass, beads and some with old horse shoes I picked up.           Another idea is to Modge podge pictures of Grand children in the cement when it dries for the garden, I tried some and it works beautiful.|`|JLayHNZCaa	This may work, put one of the pavers on a piece of board, sort of like a cookie off the edge of a plate, then, take your hammer (hope you have goggles or at least some sort of glasses), and tap fairly hard on the line where you want he paver to break to make the size you want.  Tap all the way across the paver from edge to edge in a straight line.  Then turn it over and repeat in the same place on the opposite side.  Once you have it faintly scored on both sides, start over and hit a bit harder each time.   At some point the paver should break, hopefully in a fairly straight line.  It may take a couple of tries to get  a couple of good breaks.  I have done it successfully a few times.  Good luck.|`|AA11622850	You can cut them with a diamond saw but breaking them might be a challange since they are so porous. Try scoring them deeply on either side then lining the score mark on another edge. Hit the part that you will throw away with the hammer towards the middle.|`|GFXz4vlSaa	Bring them to your home center.  They may be willing to cut them for you.  You need to use a masonry blade on a rotary arm saw to get the cuts clean.|`|35qbxLCpaa	Depending on how much space you have left i would give more space between the stepping stones so you won't have to cut anything.
eksHt5jnaa	Find clovers. A large batch of clovers may be a bit overwhelming for the amateur clover-seeker, so start off with just a small patch. Look in a patch of white clover. It will have white flowers about 4 inches tall when in bloom. Red clover rarely yields four leaves.   Scan over the patch. Don't stare down every single clover. Just look over the entire bunch in a quick swoop. This should catch the more conspicuous clovers, and, if you're lucky, will allow you to spot the four leaf clovers instantly. Don't be discouraged if this doesn't produce results, though.   Start off in a corner. Look over each clover carefully in that particular corner. It may be helpful to start on one side of a rock or a small stick, so you can keep track of where you left off.   Move your way across to the other side of the patch. Once you've looked at every clover, you should have found at least one with four leaves, but, if not, repeat once for good measure.   Go on to another patch. It's not unheard of for even a fairly large patch of clover to not yield at least one clover with four or even five leaves.   Repeat.|`|f57f19afc977beb390488d1a707b7b00aa	It has been estimated that there are approximately 10,000 three-leaf clovers for every four-leaf clover, however this probability has not deterred collectors who have reached records as high as 160,000 four-leaf clovers. It is debated whether the fourth leaflet is caused genetically or environmentally. Its relative rarity suggests a possible recessive gene appearing at a low frequency. Alternatively, four-leaf clovers could be caused by somatic mutation or a developmental error of environmental causes. They could also be caused by the interaction of several genes that happen to segregate in the individual plant. It is possible all four explanations could apply to individual cases (wikipedia.org).  therefore, you could find one from those patches in your backyard...^_^  good luck...|`|AA11040177	I have a knack for finding 4 leaf clovers.........the best way to to look for a square.....they are not a triangle, but more of a square..

I don't know, just try looking in less notice-able areas.|`|BbzFR8eCaa	I found 1 just after my husband told be to look away from the cluster...apparently if they grow away from the group they need more leaves to catch the sun, hence 4 leaves. Good luck!|`|YeYXsK0kaa	Look around fields where clover is grown for hay/feed. The type of clover most commonly used was developed to produce more clover and tend to have a much higher percentage of 4 leaf clovers (almost 10 times more 4 leafs than normal)

TMyYnvEuaa	I know a young man who started out mowing lawns for his neighbors at about your age. He now owns his grass-cutting business. He is a senior in high school, and pretty successful. It can be done.    This young man does everything he is asked, as long as it is safe and within horticultural guidelines. That means, he will not hurt plants or the environment.     If you have allergies, this is not the work for you. It is hard, sweaty and dirty work. You need a lot of guidance and training to do it well. Why don't you start by learning to take care of houseplants?  There are a lot of sources of information out there, and the allergy problems may not be as bad.   I am sorry that you do not like to pull weeds. That is probably the one thing that you will be able to do with limited training. That has become one of my favorite things to do in the garden. See how much nicer things look after the weeds are pulled and everything is tidy!   Sorry to be so long-winded. Gardening is a passion and an art when done well. I have been a gardener since I was younger than you, and there is no job that I don't like.

Also you can buy a foam seal to put around the window from B&Q also. If you can afford it invest in a good blind and heavy curtains. Failing that get the landlord to put a double glazed window in and tell him he can get one of those from B&Q also!!! Maybe the window will be cheaper than curtains, blinds and film.

jW8nfcA6aa	Your house is breathing do to years of extreme changing conditions.The structure has loosened because of years of expanding in hot conditions and contracting in cold. Nothing to worry about, just one of the joys of your home. The cracked paint could be eliminated by painting the wall, painting the molding, and then attaching the molding. Do not connect the two with paint. The separations can be covered in the corners by installing decorative carved or simulated brackets that are not joined to the moldings which allows movement. The mid-joints should be re-secured and perhaps use a smaller gauge nail to attach to the wall to allow movement.|`|DGqeGQoIaa	its called "settling".it's not so much your house moving as it is the ground that it is on.you can call a surveyor and he can monitor the movement.i hope this helps.

AA10242680	Usuallly, everything from the meter back to the transformer is covered under the utility's side. You should not have to pay for a service upgrade. (This varies from area to area, please use this only as a suggestion) The price of wire from the meter to the panel is by the foot. Aluminum wire is a good alternative to copper, and is less expensive. The panel itself, should be around 100-200 dollars, some actually come with a few breakers and are "starter panels". Remember that current circuit ratings must be applied to the new panel as well. this means that if circuit "a" is on a 20 amp fuse/breaker, it must be on a 20 amp fuze/breaker in the new panel. Best wishes.|`|AA11618316	You can find the cost of the breaker box at any of the big box hardware stores.

Do be sure that ALL the wiring concerned is 100A. rated.|`|SgpZ1BMJaa	you can't just change your 60 amp fuse to a 100 circuit breaker. It has to do with cable size. You have a 60 amp fuse because the cable can handle up to 60 amps. If you put a 100 amp circuit breaker in there will be up to 100amps running through the cable which is probably to much current and your cable then becomes the fuse(weak-spot) and it is possible it will start a fire. You should get an electrician. You may also have to upgrade the cable of that circuit which will cost more|`|AA12246425	your wire from the weather head(power co.)is capable of 200 amps.if you are gonna go through the trouble of replacing the box itself you should go 200 amp its not that much more money.{panel box $150.00 }{ground rod and accesories $60.00} {new weather head,conduit,meterbase,service LB,and 200 amp wire wire $150.00 }{assortment of new breakers to (match mfg's box)$100.00} SquareD boxes and breakers are the best but murray is good too and will save you a few bucks.if you have a general understanding of electcity and construction you can do it yourself.if not call a electrcian the average charge total is $1000 good deal to $1500 kinda high

Ask the other contractors if they checked this... unless you wanna be sittin on the commode and end up fallin down into your basement!|`|hNfOgNNBaa	If the subfloor (usually just a sheet of plywood), is damaged by water, it makes sense to spend the extra money to replace it before re-covering it.    The wax ring of a toilet serves as the 'seal' between the toilet and the plumbing and the contractor is probably correct in recommending the sewage-rotten-subfloor be replaced.    The 'flange' fits into the sewage pipe and is attached (via screws) to the subfloor (obviously, if this area of the subfloor is damaged, it will be difficult to secure.  The firmly secured flange is what holds and secures the toilet itself.  So,    A good subfloor secures a good flange install, which secures a good solid toilet.      Perhaps the other contractors didn't notice the damaged subfloor?    Your MAY be able to 'patch' the damaged subfloor and only replace what is rotten.    I'm no mold expert so you're on your own there.|`|d6bUhFnjaa	I would check with the BBB better business bureau and run there names and check with the city inspectors office for inspection issues, do you home work before you sign anything, it is common practice do give shitty work, but don't be a cheap scape either, if you are getting a new tub or shower and the floor moves up and down the you might need a new sub floor, but if you can go under the bathroom like in the basement, then have someone heavy jump up and down on the bathroom floor (with the bathtub full of water) and hold a straight board or level up to the floor joist, it will show you how much play is in the floor, when the floor bows, the board will lift away from the joist, if the floor is rotted around the toilet, then go with a new 5/8 bathroom plywood or marine plywood.

LU6vfqRzaa	Regular kitchen towels can last years if you wash them.    I change out mine twice a week if not more.  Depends on how much I use them.    They all get washed in the washing machine.    Handi wipes are good to use, but only for a couple of times.  I don't think they are machine washable.  They will become very loose with their fibers.

I use handi wipes usually just when I need to clean my hands and I'm on the go. They can be used for cleaning surfaces, but you can really only use them once.

I buy new towels when they start to fade or wear out.  I buy micro fiber rags at Target in the auto area. The micro fiber rags are used for cleaning the kitchen and and for sanitizing.
944iJNAdaa	You got my attention, but I don't know the slightest thing about teenage girl wallpaper.  Next time, be more specific in your question, and you'll get more specific answers.  This way, you got a lot of people to read your question, but not the right sort that would have good answers.  :)|`|y3lBLqIOaa	did u try target.com or walmart.com|`|F3dANXesaa	well there are some wallpapers at the home depot u can look in the dollar tree too try to save the most that u can xD HEHE!!! yeah go to the 99 cents or go to the dollar tree|`|QomVD1ceaa	girly teen wallpaper i guess?

Um7mYM71aa	You soak it in ketchup and the stains will be gone.|`|uG8yLnUWaa	Also, tomato based stains will be bleached when hung out in direct sunlight. Give it a hand wash with soap and water, then hang put in the sun. The earlier you get to a stain, the easier it will be to get out.|`|AA11040177	cold water first............there is a product called carbona in a small yellow bottle. They make it for different stains....one is for ketchup and blood. Loook for it at wal-mart in the laundry section.|`|puYiHEbLaa	I'd soak it first.  Use Shout Advanced, I've found that it gets out anything.    Also, get a Tide pen.  It's AMAZING!!!  If you catch a stain when you drop somthing on yourself, the pen can truly get out the stain right before your eyes!!!|`|w1dp0dqTaa	well once i drop wine on a dress and a friend of mine told me that if i put in bowl cold mineral water the stain would go away so do it and and like 20 min later you wash it and that would make your dress awesome again hope i it helps|`|a0JxN5lUaa	Buy Tide Bleach Alternative.  Apply the Tide bl. alt. all over the stain let it soak in then wash as you normally would with the tide bleach altern. for the detergent in the water also and the stain will come out.  This works with grass stains too.
JLayHNZCaa	Yes, rats and mice will come out looking for food in the snow.  You will see tiny little foot prints.|`|rvoo4rBjaa	Not rats-- my cat is a big hunter and he catches them from the woods near by every day but when there is snow on the ground they hide and he never gets any. Rabbits and raccoons and many critters come out in the snow.|`|Mbx4Aty7aa	I'd guess it was birds.|`|TJUQIij6aa	RATS GET HUNGER TOO EVEN IN THE WINTER. JUST KEEP FOOD PUT AWAY AND GO AROUND AND SEAL ALL HOLES CRACK NO MATTER HOW SMALL. AND THAN PUT POISON OUT IN SAFE PLACES.|`|f57f19afc977beb390488d1a707b7b00aa	some species of rats hibernates during winter... some don't... they look for food but they don't go outside in the snow... i think its a rabbit or other rodent specie...
459JmuSxaa	You can try posting a free "jiob wanted" ad on kijiji.com as a cake decorator. My husband has found jobs posting on the site. Its free and fairly popular so many will see your ad. Go to the site and select your city then click post an ad on the top tab. It really easy. Good luck with the cake decorating. I like doing that too.
VmCncRmoaa	you can air dry them by hanging up from stem they will fade in colour though    to keep there colour you can use silica    you can also freeze dry roses but it is done by a specialist company and can be expensive    to air dry    Once you have selected your roses, remove the lower leaves and bind a few of the stems together with the florist wire. It is important to keep the blossoms from touching each other; otherwise, they will dry unevenly and may discolor or misshapen where the petals touch.     Open the paper clip so that it makes a small s-hook. Slip one end under the binding wire and hang the other end on a coat hanger or length of stretched twine inside your closet. Hanging the roses upside down by their stems helps keep the blooms' shape during the drying process, which varies by temperature and humidity, usually taking from 5 to 10 days.     Using this method of drying preserves some of the rose's fragrance. It also preserves the stem which may or may not be used in arranging the dried roses for presentation or display      to silica dry    Prune away most of the stem, leaving a inch or so below the calyx. Choose a container which can be sealed and place an inch or so of silica in the container's bottom. Place the blossom upright and atop the silica layer. Gently separate the petals, positioning them to a desired final shape, and sprinkle additional silica around and in between each petal. Seal the container for 3 to 5 days, depending on the size of the bloom.|`|rvoo4rBjaa	http://www.ars.org/About_Roses/preservin...|`|da2c7386b3182f12ecdb4f7e11835704aa	Formaldehyde???  Gross.  Are you kidding.??  Why would anyone want a stinking formaldehyde preserved flower.   Just dry it in silica FCS.|`|kK2mecABaa	First of all. Formaldehyde is illegal,  being as it is essentially liquid angel dust  So your not going to get your mitts on a big jar of it.  Try rubbing alcohol.  It will be nice,
SaINc1Plaa	I would call a Heating / AC guy right away.  Similar thing happened to us this summer - the AC was on full blast and wouldn't turn off.  It was during a heat wave, so it was a "good" problem to have, but a problem none the less.  As you can guess, our electric was sky high.  Anyway, the Heating / AC guy fixed it - it turned out they installed our unit wrong and it tricked the thing into turning on at the wrong time.|`|jWtquDVUaa	Is your system operated with circulators? It could be that your flow control valve for your upstairs zone is stuck open. Or your zone valve is bad. Just make sure you haven't hung any new pictures, where a nail could have shorted the thermostat wires together.|`|jW8nfcA6aa	I have never messed with a home type system but the valve that opens and closes to regulate the flow hot water into the radiator device or radiant-in-floor heat tubes,whatever you may have, is stuck in the open position. I would guess that the valve opens with spring action and closes by electric solenoid mounted on top of the valve.If so, the solenoid may be burned out or a bad or missing elect. connection. If the solenoid can be removed ( shut off electricity to the valve before messing with it) you could probably close the valve with a C-clamp or other type. Replace the solenoid or whole valve assembly as necessary. These valves are probably located at the distribution point,near the boiler, for the supply pipes or at the inlet side of your radiator device.
oCG2JxsEaa	this isnt at home but if you go to like target or some place you can get room decals that will help they are just like big stickers that come on and off! hope this helps!|`|5ta5yyWSaa	Take pictures and have them blown up at Walmart, Walgreens, or CVS. Even a large size can be made quickly.     Buy a chalk or white board and make decorations or one of those keepsake boards with ribbons. Staple quilt batting over a chalk, cork or white board. Then staple fabric around the front. Then staple matching ribbon diagonally across and tuck in postcards, magazine pictures, etc.     There should be some matching paint somewhere in the apartment|`|YaeG1cjhaa	how about fabric http://budgetdecorating.about.com/od/lit...  or some other ideas  http://www.curbly.com/tags/walls?type=Cl...  You might want to stay away from the poster look. Your room can look so much more grown up but still cool.  Check thrift stores for fabrics or even patterned sheets. You can even drape fabrics for a bohemian look. http://www.hgtv.com/decorating/create-a-...|`|F3dANXesaa	i know how u feel im 13 !!!!!!!!!!!!welll u can go to the 99 or dollar tree u can find,baskets ,stickers,and other stuff that are cool!!!!!!!!!!!good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!xD
rvoo4rBjaa	A scraper and a miracle sponge should work well enough.-- no soap or cleaning products.|`|AA12246425	that white stuff is hard water deposits and can be removed with lime away and a green scratchy|`|YIiFWlXsaa	Look it up on Yahoo Answers ;)|`|AA10051049	We always used a new greenie pad.  You can use soap as long as you rinse it out real good.  I would put some water in it with some vinager and let it soak and than use the greenie.|`|BqO6Gko2aa	With a hammer.
