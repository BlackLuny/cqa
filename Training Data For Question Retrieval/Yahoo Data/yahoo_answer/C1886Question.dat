Went to her page then clicked on one of her friends that I am not friends with and I gave me that box  that … I can’t view her profile because we are not friends. Oh yea I can’t even see her picture … only shows that outline of a person.      Now,  I logged in to my boyfriend account and clicked on the my friend that he is also friends with … went  to her page and clicked on the same person who he is not friends with either and I can see her picture and her whole profile…. No box or outline.       I checked  his friends list and she is not on their all of them (I counted) ….Why is it that he can see her profile ? is there a setting that she might have put on? And blocked me bc I’m his gf  Or did she once send a friend request?  or could our common friend sent her a friend suggestions and thats why?  We are all on a  common network too….       Let me know if you need any clarification … Sorry if this makes NO sense.  Any help will be great...

20090310025124AAe1Ev7	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Why is my DVD freezing?	I usually play the commentary on Finding Nemo to help me get to sleep (haha), but tonight it's being ridiculously unco-operative. Windows Media Player will play it for about an hour flawlessly, and then the video will freeze and turn black. Media Player itself freezes at this time...so I'll try ejecting the CD to find out whats up. I must have cleaned it a hundred times now.      When I put the CD back in, WMP will either give me an error message saying "Windows Media Player cannot skip to the chapter" or something, or rather than give me a list of chapters, there will be only one title that simply reads "E". What is that? Error?      Then, to make it very irritating, My Computer will stop reading that I have a disc in the drive. If I restart, it works just fine. ???      For an hour, anyway.      It's really annoying, and I'm worried my DVD player is busted. It's worked fine for the last few months...if the DVD isn't scratched and there's nothing wrong with my computer, what's the problem?

20090310030621AAf4pfQ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Printers	Bought HP B9180, but it isn't printing any images. Only text.?	I've been trying to figure out HOW to print something from this printer I recently bought. The images I want to print are Illustrator files. I changed them to psd, pdf, tiff, and jpeg files in desperation to figure out WHAT would print. But instead what comes out is like..script?   And I constantly find this message among the jumble of script   "This job requires more memory than is available in this printer. Try one or more of the following, and then print again. For the output format, choose Optimize for Portability. In the Device Settings page, make sure the Available PostScript Memory is accurat..."   And it cuts off there. I've changed it to Optimize for Portability, which didn't do anything. Can't seem to find where the Device Settings page is at though. Even when I use Photosmart Pro print in Adobe Photoshop, and they display how my image will look when printed, it STILL prints out just script....      I've spent 50 dollars on the paper and I do NOT want to waste anymore money and time on this. I've spent the last 4 hrs trying to figure it out by the way.      So please, if you know how to fix this problem then tell me how! Thanks a bunch!

TCP/IP configuration is already on automatic.. i logged in the router and i've tried everything, still doesn't work? There are no proxies set, ive pinged an ip adress and on both routers this comes up:          Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),   Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:       Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 0ms, Average = 0ms..      The old router works fine, yet i ping the ip adress on the wireless connection it coemes up the same and still does not work, now the connection won't work on any of the computers.. anyone know what i can do?

I was looking at several different computers, mostly gaming models with great video cards, and finally decided on the Gateway FX 7805u from bestbuy for $1200, and the total being $1800 after 2 year warranty, Kaspersky, geek squad optimization, and Microsft Office. So far I've really liked it and its run very smoothly.    My mom walked in yesterday, picks it up, and says I need to find a lighter laptop. I told her i looked around alot before i bought, but she just doesn't believe I cant find a lighter laptop with the same specs and price. I also cannot find a case that will fit 17" laptops. Can anybody prove me wrong and help me out? She doesn't think I'll want to carry it around to class so I need a 15" laptop.       Just for Reference, the Gateway i have has a 17" screen and weighs 9.1 pounds, but has a full keyboard, 320gb HD, 4gb RAM, 2.3 GHz processor, and an awesome video card with 1gb of RAM all to itself.

20090309154317AAUwN1x	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Can I split one ethernet line coming out of my router into two separate lines?	My neighbor has internet w/router in her apartment, and we plan on splitting the bill- only her router is about 150 feet away from my computer.   I have tried wireless and it is not working- so that is now out of the picture.   I have two devices in my house that need a connection- my computer, and a logitech squeeze box that connects the internet and plays music.   My question is: As opposed to running two separate ethernet cables from the router to each device (probably being over 300 ft of wire), can I run one ethernet cable from her router, then split it to each device in my house?   Will there be loss of signal from the distance of wire? from the splitting?   Thank you

I am creating an Access file to store some medical history info of the participants in research. There are multiple fields, such as allergies to meds or current medication, that I would like to store multiple values. For example, I would like to create a list/combo box for allergies to meds field with values like penicillin, iodine, aspirin, etc. that could allow me to select more than 1 value to store in the field. Wondering if anyone could assist me in doing so in MS Access 2007. (I used the column look up wizard and typed in the values I wanted but there's nothing like "do you want to store multiple values for this look up" showed up as suggested by others). Thanks!!!

20090227150129AAApEuv	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	URGENT: My laptop has a virus! How do I deal with it, please?	About a week ago, my laptop told me that it was infected with spyware. Unfortunately, I had to turn it off and leave it for a few hours, thinking nothing of it.       When I came back, it wouldn't start up for me. When I press the "on" button, a black screen comes up and it gives me two options: "Launch Startup Repair" and "Start Windows Normally".       When I try to start Windows normally, the blue crash screen comes up and it goes back to the black screen with the options on it. When I try to launch the startup repair, the little bar with the green squares going across comes up and it keeps going, never moving on or loading up Windows.      My mum says I might have to get the drive wiped, but this is expensive and I want to see if there's anything else I can do. I have a Dell Inspiron 1525 and I run on Windows Vista. Any advice at all on this would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

20090309161251AAvMkVF	Computers & Internet;Security	Emule.com spyware/adware?	I recently downloaded something from emule.com, after which I received some type of spyware/adware. Before, it continuously changed my home page to dufpy.com, but now apparently that affect has worn off.      Even more recently, I got error logs on my desktop (hs_err_pid####.log, where #### stands for a series of digits). I know this is related to a java error, and apparently something went wrong with a program I have installed on my computer. Also, my hibernate feature (currently using Win XP), has been acting up strangely. I get the insufficient resources to complete the API error, even though I KNOW I have enough RAM & HD space for hibernation. Related to this is the fact my 'Power Options' interface does not work, nor does normally shutting down the computer, after attempting to hibernate.

20090309162005AAeKmiR	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	I just got a new HP Compaq Presario CQ50 Laptop and I gotta say, I love it, but...?	The processor just isn't putting out what I had hoped.  Its an AMD athlon x2 that runs at 1.9 ghz, and I wanna upgrade.  I do however know that it has a Celeron 575 socket p CPU, but I don't know if the processor is soldiered to the motherboard or not.  Anyway I was wondering if a Pro could even upgrade this for me, to say something in the 2.8 ghz neighborhood.  I would also like to upgrade my Nvidia GeForce 8200M card, but again, I don't know if its possible.  How much $$$$ do you think it would cost from a pro?      Thanks,

Below are the questions, i was wondering if people could help me answer these quiz questions in preparation for my test. I have tried to answer some of them, but not sure if they are right. You can assume everything such as the main function, libraries etc are all written. Only need to write whats asked.      Given the struct      typedef struct   {   int hour, min;   double sec;   } time;      a) create an array of 5 structures of time.      so i thought      typedef struct time[5];      I'm not sure about these two      b) Create a pointer to the address of the first value in the array.      c) Using the above pointer, assign the hour to 10, minutes to 30 and second to 40.8      Part B      given the class      class time   {    private:   int hour, min;   double sec;   public:   };      d) create a constructor with no arguments that defaults the hour, minutes and seconds.      so i thought       class time   {    private:   int hour, min;   double sec;      public:   time() {hour = 12; min = 0; seconds = 0.0}   };      Not sure if that is right.

20090309173052AA41g8m	Computers & Internet;Software	What can I do to complete rid Vista after I downgraded to XP?	I restarted my PC after I installed XP because Vista screwed up my computer really well this time; it loads then it hangs in a black screen after the "Microsoft Corporation" loading bar.   So I installed XP Pro.    After that, I go into the desktop of XP, get everything configured and into Windows Explorer and see a file that managed to not get deleted in the reformatting process. I restart it and the Vista load screen appears instead of the XP load screen. Then I force shutdown the PC and reinserted the XP disc and it went into the proper loading screen and everything normal happens. I copy the file-folder onto a USB key for safe-keeping measures in case it actually gets deleted. So what I'm trying to get to is, is there actually a way to rid Vista completely after I install XP?

I use various software like Dreamweaver and Flash coupled with Photoshop and Illustrator to achieve my work.      One thing that bothers me A LOT is the pricing of this software... Why does Adobe charge so much for it's software instead of trying to lower prices to discourage piracy and encourage people to use it's software? I mean, their applications costs marginally more than Windows Ultimate?!   Update prices are also high and I am considering using free software or create my own tools since I am a sort of freelance developer.      With the free software becoming more and more competitive and available, I wonder if Adobe will be able to keep up in the future with this pricing range...

I'm thinking this might be part of the problem as WoW is a horrible, monstrous file to begin with.

20090309130435AAWHS9r	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	In need of a new router - current one loses internet?	I need a suggestion for a new router.  I currently own a Linksys wrt54g, but it has a few issues.  My internet occasionally goes out (it is a fixed wireless internet) due to issues with the connection between my antenna and the tower.  If I have the cable hooked directly to my computer, it will display limited connectivity during these times, but the second the connection is available it tells me I have internet access.  With the wrt54g router, everything will work fine provided I have an internet connection.  However, when the connection goes down (signal from antenna lost), the router will not reconnect to the internet when it is available unlike the computer.  Basically, the router prevents access to the internet after it fails once although access would be capable if I were connected directly to my computer.
