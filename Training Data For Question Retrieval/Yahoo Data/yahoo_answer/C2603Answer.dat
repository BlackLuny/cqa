f1da4cb9525bd4205de70f2cd02a8f7faa	A couple of years ago, I was a victim of a robbery at the antique shop where I worked. Two guys waited til around closing time to come in and rob me (the only employee at the time). I'm a pretty petite girl so there was no way I could fight back. They rushed in and smashed the display cases with baseball bats to get the valuables inside. They also made me open the cash register. The scariest part was they also bound and gagged me with duct tape before making their getaway. I obviously couldn't call the cops right away but they were still caught b/c they were selling the stolen ANTIQUES (as in one of kind!!!) later on that week.

25e483649566611215c3c606e2ad1d7aaa	It means that the car is an automatic, but has a manual valve body installed in it.  The valve body is a set of passages in the transmission that change the gears by releasing the clutch pack when  hydraulic pressure passes through them.  A "manual" valve body is just that- you have to engage a mechanical switch to change gears.  Thats where the bump shifter fits in.  The shifter should have a spring loaded, ratcheting type of action that will pull on a cable connected to the transmission.  Push the shifter forward you upshift, backwards you downshift.  A properly built automatic transmission with a manual valve body will shift faster than having a standard manual and thats why they're popular in drag racing.  If the car's got lower gears and a bump shifter, it's been raced and probably gotten the crap beaten out of it.  You might wanna look for something else, something close to stock or all stock.  A used car is already someone else's problem.|`|AA12261030	The car is an automatic, but can be driven as a manual. There is no clutch, so to change gears you just "bump" or slightly push the gear shift to the side. The car will automatically shift for you, but you can do it yourself if you want. It can be fun to drive. I may want this car too :-)|`|X5lhdsH0aa	well this means no buttons to push just slap stick for racing.

1fe80210114bfe4f58e7539f38fed2eeaa	You probably need to change the ECTS (Electronic Coolant Temperature Sensor) $10-$20 part.  Your ignition coils probably need to be cleaned... and/or ignition wires.<br>  <br>  As for the temperature light, that implies your coolant levels are low.  The battery light implies the battery is not being charged properly by your alternator.<br>  <br>  The ECTS is a common problem with S Series Saturns... a simple part that can completely incapacitate your car.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work go to www.saturnfans.com and check out the forums.  I'll include a few links in the source list below.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  UPDATE:<br>  <br>  Forgot to mention, most '97 parts are not compatible with any  Saturn parts passed 1999.  Is this an S Series Saturn or L Series Saturn?  Most parts for S Series Saturns are lumped into the 1996 through 1999 model years.<br>  <br>  What you can do is go to an auto-parts store, ask to borrow their OBD-2 Scanner, plug it into your Saturn and write down all the error codes that come up... then post them on the saturnfans.com forum... they'll give you all the answers you'll need to get your car fixed.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|X5lhdsH0aa	well it doesn't sound like you ecm.i beleive your problem is else where,did you grease the module and ends befor installing.|`|AA11095290	Well, obviously your control module wasn't the source of the problem.  This is common though.  People will go to the CPU first, and then try the sensors.  <br>  Now you must find the sensor which relates to your problem, swap it, and see if the problem persists.  It helps to get an error decoder and have your car tell you what the problem is or could be.

1b037047daa5a242ff98379ffe8e03e1aa	What we do depends on the flight path of the preceding aircraft causing the wake turbulence, and the wind.<br>  <br>  To make a long story short, we avoid flying directly behind and below that aircraft, relative to the air we're moving through.<br>  <br>  This gets tricky because the paths we fly are not defined by air, but by the ground. We have to mentally project what is happening to the preceding aircraft's wake in the air relative to our path over the ground, and altitude.<br>  <br>  The most common times for this to be an issue are during takeoff and landing.<br>  <br>  ATC does provide extra separation between "heavy" aircraft and others, but this alert is in addition to the separation.<br>  <br>  It is also possible to encounter dangerous wake turbulence from other aircraft than those that ATC is required to warn smaller aircraft about, but in any situation where we are flying that close to another aircraft, we are usually aware of them and their type aircraft, and can plan accordingly.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	ATC says this to remind a pilot that he may encounter turbulence created by the passing of a large airliner.  Airliners can generate enough turbulence behind them to flip over a smaller aircraft behind them, so wake turbulence is a serious potential hazard.  ATC are required to mention this hazard when appropriate.  If a lot of heavy aircraft are flying, they'll warn about it frequently.<br>  <br>  Pilots do indeed pay attention, they just don't say anything about it on the radio.  If they are aware of the hazard, they can take extra precautions to minimize the chances of encountering wake turbulence.|`|dWLgwb3baa	For a good, competent pilot, hearing that caution means to paint a mental picture of the preceding traffic - is it taking off or landing?  Where did it lift off or touch down?  Which way is the wind blowing?  It's a heads up so you have the situational awareness that there is something bigger than you ahead of you.  Landing behind a 757 is not the time to allow yourself to get low on approach.<br>  <br>  Wake turbulence is more than just "bumpy air".  It is more like mini invisible tornadoes.  Avoid wake turbulence at all cost by not flying directly in and below the flight path of the aircraft generating the wake.  It's not that pilots don't pay attention.  There is just not a requirement to acknowledge the warning in a readback.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	It alerts pilots to the fact that there is "disturbed air" from a previous takeoff or landing.

0yanFPD6aa	As mentioned, it mainly depends on how you treat it.<br>  <br>  I got 35,000km out of my first chain (CBR929RR) and my second chain is about due after another 35,000km. I ride pretty easily most of the time with the occasional spurt and a track day thrown in here and there, but I clean and lubricate my chain regularly, keep it adjusted correctly and basically just look after it. Your mileage may vary depending on how you ride, whether you ride on salted roads, live near the ocean or in a dusty environment, and how you adjust and maintain it.<br>  <br>  As a side note, it's probably worth checking your sprockets and changing them too if they need it.|`|Wkn6dyvkaa	This may seem like a silly answer to you, but I always let the dealer do all maintenance on all my bikes and the ones with a chain the mechanic would inspect it for me and would tell me when it needed changing. I don't like motorcycles with chain drive and prefer shaft.|`|TSAl7ZX1aa	If you don't lube it, ride like you stole it, wheelie it, neglect adjusting it regularly, you could easily kill it in 6500kms.|`|u9pvD4PZaa	How long is a piece of string?

Next there is the "heat barrier", which isn't really a barrier, but the heating up of the aircraft's body because of friction. At Mach 2 the Concorde expands by two feet because of the heat generated, imagine the effects at M5.|`|zlPAVkUBaa	There are no mach 5 aircraft. The fastest was the SR71, and it was Mach 3+. <br>  <br>  I've never heard of an M15.<br>  <br>  Here's something one of my cohorts told me after he went to the Paris Air Show in '79 or '80. He was in a bar at an airport Hotel, and heard two French guys talking to someone else about a black aircraft they saw. He started asking them about the incident, and found out they were Concorde pilots. They told him while they were cruising from NY to Paris, a black aircraft came up beside them (not that close), waved at them, and then proceeded to leave them in their proverbial dust. They were astounded because they were flying at Mach 2.1.|`|U2pDv67qaa	Not sure if any aircraft in the world can achieve mach 5 - unless, of course, you have the blueprints for a warp engine!|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	The endurance at Mach 5 depends on the aircraft, not the pilot.  The pilot feels nothing different at Mach 5 than he would feel at lower speeds.<br>  <br>  You might be thinking of G forces.  Pilots can only tolerate high G forces (accelerations) for periods of a few seconds.  The higher the acceleration, the shorter the amount of time that the pilot can tolerate it.  The inability to tolerate high G forces is the major limiting factor on jet fighter performance today: fighters could perform considerably better if it were not necessary to keep the pilot conscious and alive.  This is one reason why the future of high-performance military aircraft may shift towards remotely-controlled aircraft.|`|JA2p5V06aa	No current known fighter aircraft can reach Mach 5.

The speed of travel has no effect - it's the acceleration that is the problem, be it in a straight line or a turn.

Afraid to shift,  I rode home in first gear.  Took it out in a field and learned the rest myself.  I rode until '81 on Honda, Triumphs and Kawasaki.

So after a couple months' worth of research (as well as taking an MSF course and buying full gear) I decided to get a new 2003 Suzuki SV650S.  It was easy to ride, cheap on insurance, got about 50mpg average, looked cool and was WAY fun!<br>  <br>  In retrospect, I should have bought a used bike, but I'm still happy I got the SV.  The one and only complaint I had about it was the forks; it's not that they didn't work, but there is a big difference between a damper rod and cartridge damper when you want performance, and it was just a fly in the ointment to me.<br>  <br>  It got dropped a couple times at low speed as ALL newbs do with their first bike, but without a lower fairing all I had to replace was a couple turn signals.<br>  <br>  I'm now on my third bike, a 2007 Honda CBR600RR.

WxSmDbS5aa	Initially, forget the price of tires. Your first priority is QUALITY ----<br>  safety is the key factor. And it's simple to understand 4 things:<br>  <br>  1) Age. Tire rubber deteriorates over time. The life of a tire just sitting in a store is about 8 years. Drive on it then and it can fall apart! So never buy a tire made more than 3 years ago because you need tires for 3-4 years max of safe driving.  //  How do you learn the age of tires? Look for the sidewall letters of DOT...that stands for the Department  of Transportation. At the end, you'll see 3 or 4 digits, and they mean the week / year of manufacture. (DOTxxx23/08 means that tire was made in the 23rd week of the year 2008.)<br>  <br>  2) Treadware. This is rated by 3 digits, and the higher the better. A treadware number is clearly shown on the sidewall, too. Look for a treadware number of 3 digits, preferably 300 or higher. That's it! <br>  <br>  3) Traction. Tire traction is rated A, B or C. Look for the traction on the sidewall, too. Do NOT buy tires rated as "C" because they will not be safe for general usage in the city or on the highway.<br>  <br>  4) Temperature. This is another rating -- A, B or C -- on the sidewall.<br>  It refers to the heat tires can suffer at high speeds.<br>  <br>  What do I buy? I routinely buy 4 tires at a time....A full set is best!<br>  Then I balance out ALL the ratings with the prices I find. Normally, I get tires that are about 2 years old, rated A/B for both traction and temperature plus a treadware rating of 350 or more. <br>  <br>  Call around, tell the tire sales people what you want, and match up the best prices you can find. Furthermore, be sure to ask that you get a free balancing with your purchase, a free rotation every 5,000 miles or so PLUS new valve stems with the new tires. These are standard... <br>  but you might not get them if you don't ask for them. OK?<br>  <br>  Good luck. And drive safely!|`|qsozRiDGaa	I found this site on ebay and it is located in Florida.

Find the pipe coming from the compressor and follow it to the engine firewall.

If you have never done it before my advice is take it to a shop and let them do it. to buy the equipment you need you could pay for the fix at the shop and have allot less headaches.|`|9740e5e8ead5b37471166c9abd4dfaa7aa	You have a leak.

lM9NvSwnaa	How do you still owe $5K more than the book value?  If the bike had custom work done, hopefully you have pictures and receipts to back it up.  Then go back to the insurance company and renegotiate on the amount.  They will pay for any add ons up to the max of the policy you took out (including custom paint and chrome).  When you hand the insurance company check over, tell the finance company the bike was stolen and ask for a cash settlement amount, then you may find the amount is far less than what the remaining monthly payments are on the bike.|`|AJmCHSwmaa	Sad to say it but your out of luck, you have to cover that 5k out of your own pocket.

The fact that his car got it in the tail pipe and yours got it on the hood means that you were breaking.  When we break hard, the nose of the car goes down.

Wkn6dyvkaa	I prefer 4 stroke myself even my boat motor is a 4 stroke. Mainly it is what you like and what your need is. how you will ride, dirt or street or both. Make sure you can sit on the bike with feet touching the floor and make sure it is not too bulky or heave for you , other than that it really just depends on what you like.|`|u1UXERV7aa	it is a hard choice to decide which bike is best for you when starting out! Personally I would try to look at this in a logical way.<br>  I suppose the first place to start would be the size of the bike you don't need to get the most powerful bike first up , but something that will give you good feel and experience I would suggest mid power as a 500cc (be careful not to get the race bikes in this category as they are quite fast and can come close to standard 1000cc bikes)<br>  <br>  The next thing to do is to check out what you think you like and go to the bike shop and sit on one or two models feel the way they're balanced and if the bars and controls are comfortable for your body size.<br>  <br>  Check out a few different bikes also if you see someone or know others who ride the same type of bike your interested in then ask them questions about their ride they are usually only too happy to let you know the truth about their choice of bike the maintenance and other good and bad points a dealer might not tell you and they can give you an idea of the repair costs and general maintenance schedules and costing.<br>  <br>  When you make your mind up go to the bike shops on promotional ride days and try out the bikes this gives a great experience and you will learn what you feel is comfortable for you you can also try out test rides from some stores.<br>  <br>  Check the secondhand stores and I would suggest a first bike is not purchased new as sure enough you might not be able to keep it shiny side up while getting used to it and don't think that's bad as everyone eventually falls off or gets hit it's just the need to ride makes you want to get back on the bike and ride so you do it time and again|`|mqezKdfeaa	if you mean dirtbikes i would say crf230 or yz250f depending on how good u are

XKYJk6Tcaa	It probably is just the cable that has broken. reach down to the clutch pedal and see if you can pull the cable or down at the hyd cylinder on the clutch that goes to the cable. I doubt very seriously that your pressure plate broke if it is not the cable then check and see if the hyd cylinder is working. and if not then just change that and put in a new cable if it was getting rough to push before it has stretched and a new one will help fix that. if those two things are good then your pressure plate might have broken a spring or a finger on it and you would have to replace the clutch assembly.
Mu38gv3Paa	This car is not a girl car... i dont know why people say that. Mine is black with dark tinted windows, it looks tough.<br>  I own a 2003 Tiburon GT V6, the V6 is only 2.7L but it still runs a 1/4 mile in 15 seconds stock. Not too bad for an automatic transmission.<br>  The car looks great, im 16 years old and its probably one of the nicest looking cars in the entire school. My friends like it, i like it. You can do a LOT of engine mods. like turbos, superchargers, cold air intakes. <br>  I have not had any problems with mine and it has 100,000 miles on it. It starts strong, and idles steady. it has a race-inspired suspension and it corners pretty well at higher speeds.(trust me).<br>  BUT, i would much rather have the 05 or 06 Tiburon. They look a lot nicer and have a more modern interior.<br>  If you have $8,000 to spend, i would definitely go with an 05 or 06, just because they look nicer all around. Just my opinion though.<br>  Good Luck on finding the right one.|`|9EKecl3Daa	I don't like the Hyundai Tiburon period. I took one for a test drive a few years ago.

RbsRpcIyaa	As mentioned before, whether or not you voluntarily turn it back in or the tow trucks come get it, you will be liable for the difference between what you owe and what it brings at auction. And right now, auction prices are dropping like crazy, so expect a huge difference to repay.<br>  <br>  You pay for it one way or another, so as the first poster said: "Do anything you can to avoid a repo".<br>  <br>  Call your lender, try like mad to work something out to stay current.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Work with your bank or loan company to try to work out a payment plan. Do ANYTHING to avoid a repo. If you return your car or it is repoed, they sell the car at wholesale auction and you are sued for the remainder of your loan balance. Furthermore, the repo goes on your credit history for 7 years, which means you can't get another loan in that time, plus you don't have a car. Find a way to keep/sell/trade but do anything to avoid a repossession.|`|1aZYDnq0aa	Well i can tell you that the repo option is probably not the way to go. Because it will go by black book value,and the way the economy is right now you will most likely get even less. Consider refinancing at a lower interest rate. Selling privately is another way to go but you probably still won't get the full amount for the vehicle.  Good Luck|`|iqMPvr7Taa	.

Then they will bill you for the difference, plus repo and auction or disposal fees.<br>  <br>  <br>  They will send a demand letter with the total owed.You will have a period of time to pay it like 30or60 days.<br>  <br>  If you don't pay they will sue and win. <br>  Giving it back doesn't relieve you of the debt.<br>  <br>  Then they will garnish wages or attach assets until paid off.<br>  <br>  And it will be on your credit approx 7 years........md|`|4d1d61e8ee76ab95bb8d2c7a9badfe1daa	sell privately, helps you maintain credit,|`|TbiSBXclaa	AVOID the REPO route as much as you possible can.  If you have the car repo'ed the bank controls your money and the outcome of the process.  They sell the car, they pay off the loan, they sue you for any balance deficiency in the payoff.<br>  <br>  If you stay in control then you make those decisions.  How much to sell the car for. How to pay back the loan (no lawsuits) and you save your credit rating and avoid the huge hit to your credit score.<br>  <br>  Even if you have to sell the car for a lose you'd be better off then having the car repossessed. If you do sell the car for a loss you need to dig into savings or go get a small loan to pay off the remaining balance.  You owe $16,000 and pay $435 a month.  Even if you sell the car for a loss of $2500 wouldn't you rather pay the bank $100 a month on a $2500 loan then having your credit ruined and going to court to pay the bank.  <br>  <br>  You owe the bank, no way you are getting out of that.  You have to pay. Pay it on your terms not theirs. <br>  <br>  This is much better for you then going to court, having your credit ruined and not knowing and not being in control of the situation.<br>  <br>  It's your money and your credit rating. Maintain control.  DO NOT hand it over to someone else.

TbiSBXclaa	Ford still owns the car so you can't do anything with it until you satisfy (pay off) the lien.  You can't sell it or junk it without the title. You can't get the title without paying off the lien. <br>  <br>  All of these methods used by the lender do the same thing. You will never be off the hook for paying back what you owe. No matter if it's a repo or a lien, you still owe the bank, you always will. That never goes away.<br>  <br>  So you live with a dead car in your yard.  The lien will prevent you from getting another loan. It's just like a repo but it's cheaper to process for Ford and it freezes your credit so it prevents you from getting rid of the car or replacing it. <br>  <br>  You need to pay off the lien or fix the dead car and keep driving it. Or you can go pay cash for a cheap car and avoid the mark the lien will put on your credit report.|`|RbsRpcIyaa	Pay off the lien first so that you can get a clear title. Then, sell it privately or junk it.<br>  <br>  If you try to sell it with a lien on it, it won't happen.<br>  <br>  *EDIT* - If you don't have the money, you can't satisfy the lien. You could "sell" the car to someone or a junkyard, but they cannot register the vehicle and therefore cannot take possession of it.

zlPAVkUBaa	Ceiling is as high as it will fly, as far as I know.<br>  <br>  There are several reasons why they do what they do.<br>  <br>  First and foremost, well O.K. maybe not foremost, they are losers. They have always been losers and always will be losers. They do this with ridiculous questions, using other people's avatars and names, and use phrases like, "There are seven of us, we are in total control." This makes them seem like winners in their own eyes, but they are still losers, poor, pitiful losers. Every time they start typing, they prove it again and again.<br>  <br>  Secondly, their status as males is in question. People only act like this if their protuberances are of minuscule size because they are children or not anatomically correct. Walking around with what would resemble a festering boil in your pants must be very demeaning. .<br>  They browse and buy items in the backs of magazines in hope of something that will help their circumstance, but a body rich in estrogen just won't allow it. Which goes back to reason #1.<br>  <br>  Lastly, they have little hope that their miserable lives will get better. Their only goal is to make others miserable so that they can feel better about themselves. Just ignore their bitterness and don't feed their hunger for any remote chance of self worth.

My educated guess is that it's been rebuilt, since a 1969 intake wouldn't have been available in 1968. Of course, for use in a 1969 Vette, Chevy could have used an "old" 1968 block, slapped a '69 intake on it, and put it in your Vette.

Not just because there is no gear changing involved, but because 'clutch control' is not needed for manoeuvres which makes reversing round corners etc. so much easier.<br>  <br>  On the down side if you pass in an automatic then you will only be able to drive automatics. This may be fine for now but remember this is for the rest of your life!<br>  <br>  At the start of last year we had two people come to us to learn in a manual as they had passed in an automatic and both wished they had learnt in a manual in the first place because it is hard to switch when you are used to only driving automatics.<br>  <br>  Do bear in mind that most people do struggle with gears when they first start driving but they soon get used to them. If you are made to feel so nervous then it may be worth giving another instructor a try as he or she may put you at your ease better and/or be able to show you an easier way of finding and using the gears.<br>  <br>  When choosing an instructor forget pass rates we can tell you anything as you cannot check, instead check their grade, we only use grade 5 & 6 instructors with grade 6 being the highest an instructor can achieve and you can check this with the Driving Standards Agency.<br>  <br>  Remember it is easier to switch from manual to automatic so I personally would recommend you start with a manual gearbox and only switch if you are having big problems with clutch and gears. <br>  <br>  Whatever you choose don't be nervous but take your time so you can enjoy your driving lessons<br>  <br>  Hope the info helps!|`|0ZjQp78Daa	no, i would recommend that you use a normal gear change car. if you take your test in an automatic you are only able to drive an automatic and not a car with a gear change, whereas if you take test in a car with gear change you can the also drive an automatic without a further test. i am sure you will easily learn to change gear, it will become Second nature to you very quickly.|`|8624d8f3c13640e544dfac9ee3736a3faa	I would recommend starting with automatic.  When you get behind the wheel of a car for the first time, there are so many things to focus on, that minimizing your distractions and obstacles is the best way to go.  Once you get the hang of driving automatic, then you could go back and learn manual if you feel like doing so.|`|gwj1a9jPaa	All the out-dated reasons for not learning on an automatic in the UK have long disappeared. You can buy just about any car in an automatic version and they are no more expensive to run and just as reliable as a manual. It only matters if you are likely to be regularly borrowing a friends' car and they have a manual - is that likely?<br>  <br>  It's your choice. I strongly suggest trying both before you decide.|`|8VOh2jxcaa	since you have never drove before you should start with an automatic because you don't have to shift and it's simple to operate.|`|dzfhytsJaa	It's easier than you may imagine to learn how to use the gears. It takes confidence as well as training. Just choose an experienced driving teacher - avoid parents!<br>  If you STILL have trouble with gears after a few lessons, you can opt to learn in an automatic and pass the automatic test. However, this means you will ONLY be legally able to drive automatics in the future, unless you take a 'manual' re-test. This may be OK, although automatics are usually more limited in availability for car rentals in the UK and Europe.<br>  And automatics are more expensive to buy new in the UK too.|`|0fb4589d7d6babcc79f63404f6039751aa	I have no choice in the matter, as I have only one usable leg, but, you should try a manual first, as to pass in an auto will limit you to only being licenced to drive autos. If you find you cannot get to grips with shifting gears and all that stomping about on the pedals, then go for an auto. <br>  Take no notice of the "macho" idiots, that try to imply that somehow you are somehow a lesser driver if you choose the auto route, after all, most of the buses and taxis in city's are automatics|`|CNEmoUOwaa	If you are taking the test use automatic. It makes you more able to concentrate on the road and rules.<br>  <br>  But you should learn on a stick so that you can drive anything in any situation.|`|3mu1IWTzaa	if you didn't learn on a stick shift, go for automatic at first, less to worry about for hands and feet!|`|fYkaxJYOaa	automadic then u will not hve to shift

dQrBlk4qaa	That's funny - I have never had any problems with GM's wiring harnesses.

BXPinGXRaa	Is it leaking out all your coolant? If so then it needs to be changed now!  If it is not then you can take it to the shop and have them pressure test the cooling system and they can see if you have a small leak, but even then you can put a pill into the coolant system and most of the time it will work. If you have changed out your engine then you need a new water pump. What makes you ask? Are you having any problems? Such as temp or any other malfunction?|`|uBpx2JDGaa	Symptoms are an overheating engine with coolant leaks. If your coolant is low no matter how much you add and you see coolant leaking onto the ground, the most likely culprit if the water pump. Even is the leak isn't in the water pump itself, replacing the water pump will automatically find where the leak is, and is usually the standby for auto mechanics. If there are no visible leaks, your coolant levels are stable, but your car continues to overheat you probably have another more minor (and less costly) issue, such as the thermostat.|`|k56mmj2eaa	Well most of the time There is a small hole in the bottom of the Water pump housing. if it is leaking water you need to replace it.

IA7Gy9TAaa	Refinance will be very difficult but with such an outrageous APR I'd give it a shot, as soon as possible.  You got a good deal on the price of the car but they took you to the cleaner at the F&I office.  It's called "making it back on the back end of the sale."  Unfortunately it makes that great deal completely average or maybe even a fair amount too much.<br>  <br>  With a 687 you should have never signed a contract with that bank.  This is going to be tougher than you're expecting to do a refinance, I'm betting they've got fees and penalties for early repayment.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Depends on how much you still owe (call your bank) and how much the car is worth (check www.kbb.com). If you still owe more than the car is worth, you'll have great difficulty finding a lender who is willing to loan you more than 100% of the car's value. If you can make up the difference in cash, then you have a pretty good chance.<br>  <br>  BTW, a refinance company is nothing more than any bank, credit union, or loan company who offers used car loans.

It doesn't mean that you're a bad driver or she's a bad parent.<br>  My dad used to be awful - he put my mom off driving for years when he tried to teach her. To this day she still won't drive stick and hates freeways. What I did was I talked to him about it when we were in a more relaxed setting, at home with a beer in his hand. I explained that I really appreciated him driving with me, but when he yelled at me it scared me. When he screamed "get over" it made me think that a child was about to run in front of my car or something and I could have reacted by swerving onto the other side of the road. Just explain to her that although you know it's stressful she has to keep her reactions proportionate.

KOXcw4klaa	1-if your car has ratcheting type rear calipers then yes you need a special tool.napa sells it.its a universal one.its cheap though.<br>  2-when compressing the calipers the brake fluid will return back to the master cylinder and could over flow/spill out.so your best bet is to pop the hood and take the cover off the master cylinder and see if its full or low.it should be low if the pads are worn and you never put fluid in the master cylinder.so then your safe of not have to drain any out.as for pads,your best bet is to call all local parts stores and get prices.oh and heres a helpful hint if you need to drain some brake fluid out.use an old dish soap bottle to suck out the fluid.it usually works good.|`|AA10255483	1) not sure on a mitsubishi, but try compressing the piston with a set of large channel lock pliers, or a C-clamp on the inboard pad. if it doesn't ga in very easily, you may need to rotate the piston as you push it in.<br>  <br>  2) Technically, yes.  You are supposed to remove the cap, and using a turkey baster, remove about half of the brake fluid in the resevoir.  Doing this will avoid overflowing the resevoir when you compress the pistons on the calipers.  <br>  <br>  3) the best place is the dealer.  They have the original parts.  Not the cheapest though.  You may consider someplace like AutoZone or Murray's that have a lifetime warranty on their brake pads.  That's what I do but that is only because my car eats brake pads.  Brake late, and carry alot of speed through the corners!!|`|nxEoR9CEaa	Yes you need a "C" clamp to compress the piston, yes you need to remove the cap on the brake fluid(compressing the piston force the fluid back to the reservoir) and go to Advance, Auto Zone, NAPA, Nationwise, etc. for your pads.
3MTYGEbWaa	There's a lot to know. Here's a web site that has much of the kind of information you will need:<br>  <a href="http://www.firstcarguide.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.firstcarguide.com</a><br>  <br>  .|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	New or Used?  Each demands a certain approach.<br>  <br>  With a new car, go to Edmunds.com, price out the car you want at the trim level you want and options you want.  You'll get 3 prices.  Dealer invoice price, sticker price, and average purchase price.  You'll also see any dealer incentives such as rebates or 0% loans.  Your goal is to get as near to the dealer invoice price less incentives as possible.  A great tool to use is silence.  When they make you an offer they'll write it down.  Just stare at it for a while silently.  I did this unintentionally and the sales guy started talking about how maybe he could lower it some.  <br>  <br>  Time is a 2 edged sword.  Dealers know the longer they keep you there, the more chance you'll close the deal.  But it can also work in your favor too.  The longer you are there the more time they have to sweeten the deal to one of your liking.<br>  <br>  For new, another great tool is to use carsdirect.com or perhaps an auto buying service through Costco or AAA or a credit union if you are a member.  Using those services, you put what you want in a car and they'll make a no haggle offer that's generally pretty good.  Maybe not as good as you could do if you were a hard nosed haggler, but good enough.<br>  <br>  For used, it's a whole different ball of wax.  Look on craigslist, cars.com, edmunds and Kelly Blue book to see what cars are going for at certain trim levels and mileages.  Then go in and try and talk them to the lower end of that.  You'll also want to run a Carfax report to make sure the cars hasn't been totaled.  And whatever deal you make should be contingent on a clean bill of health from your own mechanic's inspection.|`|FFrXGuxMaa	Research about the car and how much it is worth. Figure out what you will offer for it, be polite, and be willing to walk away without the car if needed.

AA12095978	They're not the best built truck in the world for nothing.<br>  <br>  they are tough, strong, durable/reliable and there's tons of aftermarket accessories you can get for it.<br>  Main problem with the 5.3 Triton motor, and this isn't on all of the trucks, the spark plug(s) tend to get stuck in the cylinder head. This is usually because they're left in for so long.  Getting them out isn't hard, there are kits available that are designed to specifically deal with this issue.<br>  The easist solution is to change the plugs and use an anti-seize compound on the threads, this will ensure the plugs will come out easily the next time, and also torque the plug to 15pounds.<br>  To remove them, you're supposed to crack the plug loose, turn it like 45degrees and stop. then spray carb cleaner down the plug tube and let it soak in. and then wait a few minutes and do it again.  why carb cleaner?  it burns easier  than penetrating oil and works close enough.<br>  you can find this info out via internet searching.  I actually recommend using Seafoam's Deep Creep.  it burns easily and cleans and well.. it's just awesome stuff!<br>  <br>  if you have the 3valve engine, you'll get more bang for your buck.  the regular 2valve is good, but mileage isn't as good as the 3valve.  not a big deal.<br>  <br>  At the factory, they're probably torqued to 50 via air ratchet.<br>  there aren't any electrical problems with them, except for one thing that I've seen on a few of these, the positive battery cable spiders out like 5 direction/connections.<br>  If the battery leaks, and the terminal becomes corroded, and you don't clean it quickly enough, the corrosion will act like mold and grow down the cable, and essentially destroying it. This actually is something that easily can happen to ANY CAR.  the cable is like $150 from Ford, you can't goto an autoparts store and pickup a generic, there isn't enough pigtails to make all the connections.<br>  <br>  you can buy a Hypertech or superchip programmer and modify the car computer for bettrer mileage, power, shift points, etc.. even reprogram the speedo for bigger tires.|`|esaxd01Eaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure.

VEGJlMrsaa	I treat most night flying as IFR flying. Its not required and sometimes not necessary but if you begin each flight as if it were an IFR flight, you will have an adequate margin of safety.<br>  <br>  It all begins with a weather briefing and looking out the window. You can tell if there are clouds or not just by looking up at night, the weather briefing will give you more detail.  For a VFR flight at night I want 5sm and 3,000' clouds as a minimum, any less than that and I'll file IFR. I'm guessing that's probably not an option for you, so consider scrapping the flight. <br>  <br>  Once in flight pick up flight following. At night atc is usually slow enough that they will give you flight following, which will essentially keep you clear of all other known traffic, and you can usually get a heads up about other traffic. This is always a good practice but even more so at night when you may end up in a cloud. If you do end up in a cloud with flight following you are at a much lower risk, as you will be kept clear of IFR traffic.  I'm not advocating a VFR only pilot go into the clouds, but its a matter of if, not when it will happen. Its best to be prepared.  <br>  <br>  Keep up on your instrument work. Even if you only plan to be a VFR pilot its a great idea to take a few hours of instrument instruction.  You should be somewhat comfortable knowing you can fly only on the instruments and maybe know a little about shooting an approach just in case you end up between a rock and a hard spot. ATC or other pilots will be able to help in the event of such an emergency (a vfr pilot in imc truly is an emergency) but you still have to pull your own weight. <br>  <br>  You can only avoid clouds sometimes, if you fly enough, especially at night, you will eventually end up in clouds on accident despite your best attempts to avoid it. Prevention comes first, followed by being prepared.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	You can fly VFR at any time of day in the U.S.<br>  <br>  If you cannot see the clouds around you at night, you cannot legally fly VFR, since you need to avoid clouds while under VFR.  If you cannot see clouds, you probably can't see much else, either, and if you can't see enough to navigate visually, you should probably defer your VFR flight.<br>  <br>  The cloud clearances and visibility requiements are the same day and night, except that VFR below 10,000 feet MSL in Class G airspace requires visibility of 3 miles at night, and 1 mile during the day.<br>  <br>  If you don't have clear weather and a nice full moon or other ground lighting to help you find your way, IFR flight might be a better option for nighttime flying.  This is all the more true when the terrain isn't very flat, as those dark spots among the lights might be mountains.|`|dWLgwb3baa	You can get an idea of where the cloud bases are when you get your weather brief.  You can also see clouds pretty well if the moon is out, assuming you are not talking about an overcast layer.<br>  <br>  But you are right, clouds are much harder to find away from city lights on a moonless night.  Part of your VFR training is getting out of inadvertent IMC.  This means descending if you climbed into the cloud or making a 180 degree turn if you flew into a cloud bank from level flight.  Sometimes, mistakenly finding the clouds is the only way you can tell where they are.|`|8e61fa24656c3d78a47369750bd463c5aa	I've logged many hours flying VFR at night in the U.S.  It's legal.  It's accomplished using ambient lighting, such as moonlight, city lights, etc, reflecting off the clouds.  <br>  <br>  If you happen to fly into clouds, you can determine this by your strobs or other aircraft lights beginning to refract the clouds around your aircraft and loss of forward visibility.  You should respond by manuevering a safe distance from the clouds determined by the class of airspace you're in.  Of course, maintain ground separation standards as well.  If unable, you then cannot maintain VFR clearance required and cannot legally continue.<br>  <br>  In reality, it's easier said than done.  But if there's a concern about maintaining cloud clearance and a safe altitude, then you need to seriously reconsider continuing the flight if you cannot proceed IFR.  Turn back, land, or get an instrument rating and IFR aircraft.  <br>  <br>  Caution:  Many times low flying VFR aircraft are undetectable by ATC radar systems depending on the area, and IFR aircraft sometimes rely on VFR aircraft to maintain the separation standards from clouds to safely operate in many cases, so be careful, especially near uncontrolled airports.  If you're in the bottoms, an IFR aircraft may be as little as 500 feet above you and neither of you may know about it.  If you have an out dated altimeter setting for the area, you may be closer than that.<br>  <br>  ** Yeah, and what Dennis said below.  I always made it practice to get a weather briefing, regardless of the expected weather and duration of the flight.  Good add, Dennis!|`|0h9aD7Toaa	Like one of the guy's said, you can fly vfr anytime, day or night, provided the weather conditions are above minimum vfr conditions, and you are current for night vfr flight..|`|0CkFC43raa	check out this site. they have posted the minimums for VFR operation, including NVFR;<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risingup.com/fars/info/part91-155-FAR.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.risingup.com/fars/info/part91...</a>

You could get ahold of tube headers, preferably dual exhaust headers with a crossover pipe.  Another option that is only really worth it if you have headers, is a cat-back exhaust kit.  You can also pull the heads and take them to a local machine shop for porting on the intake and exhaust manifold ports and have them shave off small amounts of meat off the bottom of the head (0.010" at a time) to raise the compression ratio although beware because a higher compression ratio will require higher quality gas or gas with a higher octane rating, and milling off to much meat can cause valvtrain geometry problems.  Or if your not into all that head work, if you have a V6 you can call up clifford performance, they specialize in straight six power, but probably do V6 performance parts as well, you can find their website at <a href="http://www.cliffordperformance.net." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffordperformance.net.</a>|`|gmh6X3Qiaa	yes it does..i myself have a 2003 dodge stratus sedan and it is fast..of course i put a cold air intake on it..and turbo..it is definately a quick car,specially for a sedan

1ejg2WUMaa	it depends on what kind of music you listen to... also if you have any other upgraded components to your stereo. if the stereo is stock and your adding a sub generally it will drown out the vocals at high volumes... <br>  if you want to add a nice clean mid/low bass to your sound spectrum in your car 150-200 watts RMS would do fine.. any larger without any additional upgrades would unbalance the sound in my opinion ie..( to much bass not enough vocals)<br>  <br>  as far as an amp and sub i personally can recommend a JL W0v2 and either a JL 250/1 amp or even an alpine of similar power...<br>  www.jlaudio.com<br>  www.alpine-usa.com <br>  <br>  JL and alpine are higher priced than the average market subwoofer but the overall quality and performance wont disappoint... and you will have classy audio stuff so ppl cant give u crap for having lesser gear than them.|`|eA33xJmRaa	Depends on what you are looking for.

AA12095978	your better bet is to take the alternator to an electrical shop who can rebuild the alternator to handle the extra wattage instead of trying to find one.<br>  <br>  Better yet.. install a secondary battery, like a yellow top Optima, to power the amps & subs, put a battery isolator in between so you can still use your regular stock alternator, and the amps won't be affecting the vehicle electronics.<br>  The alternator will charge both batteries at the same time, but won't be affected by the massive current draw from the amps.  the yellow top will be able to dish out power without having to suffer.<br>  Also put a capacitor in your mix as well, it won't do much to save current draw, but it'll help a bit, and when a loud thump comes, the cap will be able to power that current spike easily, and they recharge instantly.l<br>  putting a larger alternator isn't a long term solution, as you'll eventually end up heating it up over time.
P9x8n16Taa	Sorry, there's not much you can do to get your money back. Trust me, I'm on my 26th used car, and they are usually money pits.

Brakes, hoses, power steering pump, etc. are relatively easy projects. If you know anyone that has any experience working on cars, you can easily save hundreds of dollars compared to paying a shop to work on it.

When you buy a used car you should always have a mechanic check it out first to avoid these problems, sorry.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	There is legally nothing you can do. Used cars are sold "as is" and you have no right to return it or demand a refund. <br>  <br>  When you buy a used car, the burden is on the buyer to inspect the vehicle to make sure it will meet their needs. You do this before you buy it as it is the only protection against buying a piece of junk. After you've signed the paperwork, it's too late to back out.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	caveat emptor. This is a latin term. It means buyer beware. It means that a buyer should closely examine anything before they buy it. It means you did not heed this life lesson. It means you have learned a life lesson, the hard way. It means you should find a way to make the necessary repairs and satisfy your debt obligation.|`|IA7Gy9TAaa	Sorry, everyone else is right.<br>  <br>  For $2,500 you've got to expect some problems.  The car dealers have clever answers like "that's why this one's $14,000 off the new car price."  Or more appropriately for your Lexus, $33,000 less.<br>  <br>  Power steering pumps can take a very long time to "die."  The pump could do the moaning and leaking for five years before you'd actually have to replace it, just keep an eye on your power steering fluid and keep a bottle in the trunk to fill it up with.  Brake pads should only be about $150 installed and after a certain number of miles it's not really a "problem" as much as it is just standard maintenance, they don't last forever, it's like an oil change.<br>  <br>  There is no magic answer, you can't sue or give the car back or expect the dealer/seller to pay for the repairs.  $2,500 cars come "as is" with no warranty.<br>  <br>  Your only options are to keep making your payments and repair the car when it breaks down, sell the car to some other person and hope you'll do better on the next one (not really feasible if your price range is still around $2,500, the next one will have similar problems) or do something incredibly stupid like stop making payments because the car needs repairs and just say I don't care what you do or say, I'm not paying for a broken car.  Don't do that last one unless you don't mind going to court or destroying your credit, both would be dumb to do over a fifteen hundred dollar debt.  (you'd just lose in court and have to pay anyway, plus pay his court fees, and destroying your credit over $1,500 would just be dumb.)<br>  <br>  I'm sure you don't need to hear this last part either but an 18 year old luxury vehicle is a terrible first car.  As I'm sure you've learned, repairs are a lot more expensive and frequent on that old Lexus than they would be on a $2,500 ten year old Civic.|`|RbsRpcIyaa	No, unless it's a new vehicle with a warranty (or a used one with warranty), there is nothing you can do except fix it and keep it going. <br>  <br>  There is no return policy/law pertaining to vehicle sales. Once you sign papers and drive off, it's yours, problems and all.<br>  <br>  *EDIT* -- No offense, but what "magic" answer are you expecting? Those of us that have been on here awhile are answering to the tune of what legal remedies you might have (none) and what you can do about it (keep fixing it or let it die, but either way it's your car and you must pay for it). There is no legal way out of your contract, and you cannot make the seller pay for the repairs unless it's written in your contract. <br>  <br>  Again, no offense, but there is no other answer.<br>  <br>  "I'm not paying more to repair a car then it's worth. that's just stupid." -- Fine and dandy, but it's the risk you took when you purchased an 18-yr old vehicle. You can't just stop paying because the car stopped running. It does indeed happen to plenty of folks who purchased used vehicles. "As-is" means the buyer assumes the risks and responsibilities of purchasing the vehicle and maintaining it.

I'm guessing that your old alternator went bad, the car died and you had to get it replaced... yes?<br>  <br>  Most likely, the lack of alternator killed the battery.  <br>  <br>  The short answer is that you use both the alternator and the battery when the car is running.  The battery powers everything, while the alternator generally just keeps the battery charged.  If the alternator dies and you run the battery down to nothing, chances are you also destroyed the battery.<br>  <br>  What you described sounds like the battery is maintaining enough charge to start the vehicle, but the extra drain on an already weak battery is causing your current issues.<br>  <br>  You COULD have a bad alternator,.. it wouldn't be the first time (in fact, it happened once to me, twice in a row on the same vehicle).  BUT generally that only happens with remanufactured or rebuilt alternators.  If you bought a new OEM one, then most likely it's good.<br>  <br>  Take the car to Advance Auto, or Autozone or some place like that.

AA10612715	The Escort ZR3 will only jam police laser...For Radar you will need a radar detector...<br>  <br>  I recommend that most people start with a radar detector like the Escort 8500 X50, 9500i, or BEL Vector 995 or Valentine One before they get a laser jammer as cops use radar more often than laser.<br>  <br>  There is nothing on the market currently that jams police radar and jaming police radar is illegal in all 50 states, and is a felony offense.<br>  <br>  Laser jamming is only illegal in 10states, and you can get away with jamming laser in those states just by slowing to the posted speed limit and then turning the jammer off|`|lqINcThraa	I know that you probably do not want to hear this, but those work, only if the officer leaves the unit on all of the time. Generally what happens is the radar/laser unit is locked until there is a vehicle that appears to be traveling faster than the posted speed limit. The officer then unlocks the unit and has the suspect vehicle on radar before the suspect even knows there is a cop around. Radar detectors do work, but only with cops that keep the radars on all of the time. Think about that before wasting your money.|`|2HKSwHkSaa	In most tests that I have seen, the top radar detector tends to be the Valentine One.  It is one of the more expensive ones out there, but it ranks the best.

kPdJAjcnaa	Le mur du son est un phénomène lié au domaine transsonique. Un écoulement autour d'une aile (autour d'une balle de fusil, c'est qualitativement la même chose), subsonique loin de celle-ci, est accéléré dans son voisinage jusqu'à atteindre Mach 1. Le retour au subsonique se fait à travers une compression brutale, l'onde de choc. Ceci entra?ne une augmentation de la tra?née et un décollement à l'aval de l'onde de choc qui se traduit par une instabilité analogue au décrochage.<br>  <br>  Si la vitesse augmente à partir de là, l'onde de choc recule jusqu'à atteindre le bord de fuite et il se forme une autre onde de choc devant le bord d'attaque (voir, par exemple, [[2]]). Le mur du son est alors franchi : l'écoulement a retrouvé la stabilité avec le régime supersonique qui se caractérise par les deux ondes de choc à l'origine du double bang.<br>  <br>  On notera que quand l'atmosphère est très humide, par un phénomène proche de celui qui produit la tra?née blanche courante derrière un avion à réaction, le phénomène peut s'accompagner d'une condensation locale qui permet de visualiser l'onde de choc sous la forme d'une sorte de bouclier plus ou moins vaste qui précède légèrement l'avion.<br>  <br>  On entendait sur les premiers avions supersoniques un double bang, mais souvent très proches et pas toujours faciles à distinguer. Le premier correspond à l'onde de choc issue du nez de l'avion et surtout du bord d'attaque des ailes, le second est formé sur l'empennage. Dans les avions modernes, la section de l'avion est ajustée de manière qu'il n'y ait pas de discontinuité de la section globale de l'avion, ce qui se traduit notamment par un pincement du fuselage à la jonction avec les ailes. à cause de cette forme générale, l'onde de choc à grande distance est à présent unique<br>  <br>  Le terme de mur du son a une signification d'abord historique. En effet, lorsque les aviateurs de la Seconde Guerre mondiale ont commencé à s'approcher de cette limite, ils ont remarqué des phénomènes d'instabilité et un durcissement des commandes de l'avion. Cette combinaison a rendu l'approche de cette limite particulièrement difficile, au point que les aviateurs avaient fini par l'appeler le mur du son. Lorsque Chuck Yeager a franchi cet obstacle à bord du Bell X-S1 le 14 octobre 1947, le terme est quand même resté pour donner une description imagée d'une augmentation brutale de la résistance.<br>  <br>  ? Mur du son ? est en fait une expression due à un ingénieur britannique des années 40, W. F. Hilton, qui se demandait si un avion pourrait jamais dépasser la vitesse du son. Lorsqu'un avion vole à une vitesse inférieure à celle du son, il génère des perturbations de l'écoulement d'air. Si sa vitesse approche celle du son (331 m.s ? 1 dans l'air à 0°C), il engendre des ondes sonores très fortement comprimées. à la vitesse supersonique, les ondes forment des ondes de choc coniques appelées c?nes de Mach. En atteignant le sol, ces derniers produisent le bang supersonique. L'aérodynamisme et la voilure des avions, en forme de flèche, contribuent à pallier les inconvénients des ondes de choc. Cependant, aucun moyen n'a été réellement expérimenté pour éviter le bang supersonique, car la pointe du c?ne de Mach part de l'avion et sa base se dirige vers la terre. Et c'est le choc de la surpression et de la décompression de l'air sur nos tympans qui produit la (double) détonation. On suppose qu'un appareil qui utiliserait la propulsion par MHD (il y a eu plusieurs essais en soufflerie), ne produirait pas le bang supersonique.|`|gDLeO1C3aa	non|`|oLwB1xoZaa	TGV = mach 0,6

119ca40f98202d58cfc2090a452b22ceaa	Its never a bad time to buy an American built truck.

It would help the economy to send big money towards the purchase of a truck, but not the same way it would if you got an American truck.  Just as Mad Jack said, keeping US companies providing US jobs is SO important now.  People think it counts when they buy a Tundra which is made in Texas, but the profits go back to Japan.  And think about this - if there's nothing wrong with buying an American-made Toyota, then why are all of GM and Chrysler's bridge loan terms based on comparisons to "foreign automakers?"  Because they are in danger of putting them out of business since their profits are not as beneficial to the US economy.<br>  <br>  The Colorado/Canyon are durable small trucks like the Tacoma and can tow a fair amount.  The Ranger has the best fuel economy of ANY truck on the market.  The Durango has a powerful engine that has nice towing capabilities.  Check those out PLEASE.

g6easyBFaa	A crumbling catalytic converter is not uncommon on the RX8.  Rotary engines have hotter exhaust gases than piston engines which can reduce Cat life.  Also a flooded engine during ownership will shorten its life.  In Canada and the USA cat's have a fairly long warranty proscribed by governments...100K miles I believe.  Whether this holds true for the UK is another matter.  Check with Mazda on this.  <br>  <br>  I would doubt that the O2 sensors need replacing yet, but it is a possibility.  I would want to see that an error code had been thrown, and continues to be thrown after the catalytic converter is replaced before I would accept that they need replacing.<br>  <br>  And yes, 1500 pounds seem VERY high for replacing a cat and 2 O2 sensors.  The labour for both is not very much.<br>  <br>  RX8's are known for killing their ignition coils.  This usually only shows up when the car is driven very hard, like being taken to a track often.  If you inspect your coils you can see if they need replacing.  The plastic housings will show melting damage.  If they do need replacing and you do take your car to the track I'd look around the 'net for heat sinks that can be mounted underneath the packs.  It will greatly improve their lifespan.<br>  <br>  And again, 430 pounds seem VERY high for replacement.  Again, there is very little labour in replacing them.  They can be expensive but should not be that much.<br>  <br>  Go online and check the parts pricing.  They seem high to me but in the UK that may just be what the prices are.  But I think they're trying to take advantage of you.|`|EOqxenK9aa	"Report found". That's a very clever report you got there.<br>  <br>  Reports don't find anything, people do. So this is a pile of rubbish right there. What they mean is that the engine management computer might have indicated something that "indicates" broken catalyst etc.<br>  <br>  Make sure they disassembled it, pulled the cat with its pipe out, as well as the oxygen sensor. Make sure they show it to you. Don't believe them otherwise. Ask them what exact trouble codes did they pull from the ECU (engine computer).<br>  <br>  "Coil packs may need replacing" -- unlikely, unless they were the problem which caused the catalytic converter to break up. Cat converters don't break up: the either overheat and melt, or they simply get old and stop working. If the mixture is OK, and you don't use leaded fuel or wrong additives, or wrong silicone gaskets, cat converters will last a long time. It's rare that a cat converter would crack and break up. Not unheard of, of course.<br>  <br>  Usually with the coil packs it's either they work or they don't. Don't replace them unless the car runs rough once the cat converter problem is sorted out. Also a wholesale replacement of  *all* coil packs is rarely necessary.<br>  <br>  I have a 2000 Volvo S80 which had coil packs with manufacturing defects. They started failing one after another, and it was trivial to check which one was dead: you'd disconnect the wire harness from the coil pack, and the engine sound/RPM would not change at idle: that was the dead pack. After replacing 3 coil packs over 3 months, I gave up and just replaced the other 3 so as not to have to worry about that again.<br>  <br>  There must be a reason why the catalytic converter broke up. It may be just a random crack that grew. But is it just broken up, or did it overheat and melt? If it overheated and shows signs of melting of the ceramic honeycomb inside of it, then you have other problems that have to be fixed first -- likely the car runs lean for some reason.<br>  <br>  So: ignore the coil packs, make sure you see the cat converter and the oxygen sensor first. Don't get scammed. Many car mechanics have no understanding of what they are doing and will not fix the problem -- they will replace this and that, never fixing it.<br>  <br>  If you end up replacing the catalytic converter, make sure you replace all the oxygen sensors at the same time. Underperforming oxygen sensors will shorten the life of a catalytic converter. A cat costs so much that changing the oxygen sensors with it is not all that much more, but you won't waste a perfectly good cat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I have yet to see a bad coil pack that doesn't cause obvious drivability issues. They can be tested if you're insistent, don't just replace them without testing the spark voltage first. It's also easy to check for unburned fuel in the exhaust reaching the cat converter, a shop that knows what they're doing will be able to check for that.|`|HXO2vUcIaa	basically the question has been answered so theres no need to beat a dead horse by saying what everyone else has said...its too much<br>  <br>  personally if i were in your shoes i would just ditch the cat and get an aftermarket exhaust system..the o2 sensor will probably need to be replaced but just buy a new exhaust and forget the cat ever existed....that what i did with my z and what i planned on doing with my old rx-8|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	So: ignore the coil packs, make sure you see the cat converter and the oxygen sensor first.

GAIZuKqvaa	If you wire two 4 ohm subs in parrallel it will present a 2 ohm load to the amp which is the normal impedance amps are rated for. if you wire them in series they will have a resistance of 8 ohms and will only pull about 1/4 of the amp power so i would say wire them in parallel. but if the amp is truely 1600 watts rms, you may not want them to pull the full 1600 watts because those subs can only handle 800 watts rms together so it might cause damge if the amp signal is clipped|`|8VOh2jxcaa	I DON'T KNOW!!!

When did you last check the oil level?<br>  <br>  Failing that it could be a service indicator.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, orange lights are low fluid level indicators or minor warning lights, so if you cant rectify the fault by topping up the oil then let a garage check it for you whenever you get the chance.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps
