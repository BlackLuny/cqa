Certaines personnes issues de certaines communauts narrivent pas a se mettre dans la tte quil faut laisser de cot toutes les ranc?urs et problmes que lont peut rencontrer dans nos pays dorigine.     Le pire dans cela est que cela concerne des jeunes qui nont pas connus tous ces problmes et certaines communauts entretiennent de fa?on viscrale toutes les blessures du pass, je passerais sur le fanatisme religieux qui est malheureusement bien prsent.    -Oui la France a t un pays colonisateur  -Oui la France a commis des exactions  -Oui la France nest pas parfaite    Sommes-nous meilleurs pour autant ?  Si nous avons choisi (nos familles) de vivre dans ce pays, cest quil nest pas si ingrat que cela et quil a su accueillir nos familles parfois quand elles taient dans une profonde dtresse voir plus.

Certaines communauts ne se rendent pas vraiment compte quelles vivent dans un pays qui a dj des traditions, des pratiques religieuses, une culture Judo Chrtienne.

PyaXTpFdaa	Gypsies came originally from Romania. If they are in a tribe they follow their tribal ways. If they have left the tribe for modern society they are no different from anyone else. You can usually recognize them by their flamboyant, romantic attire, jewelry and line of work. They tend to tell fortunes, work at carnivals, etc. They are an eclectic, artistic breed of people and I love them dearly. They are often stereotyped as thieves, child stealers, prostitutes and robbers around a campfire. They tend to travel by caravan from one place to another like people without a home. They are often referred to as Bohemian as many are from Bohemia, Czechoslovakia.|`|xm7kFnfNaa	They're just members of the Romani people. Whoever warned you to steer clear of them is woefully ignorant as they seemingly get blamed for all of the ill will that takes place around a village - a dated custom which goes back to medieval times.

b2ZJyZp5aa	Basically they found this tablet 50 years ago that tells the story of a guy named Simon, an Israeli who let a revolutionary movement against the Roman empire. This part of the story isn't as important as the way his followers wrote about him after he was killed by the Romans. They used common key phrases like the "son of man" and "will rise in three days" and that the revelation was given by the angel Gabriell. These are important for two reasons: 1. They come from several prophetic books in the Torah/Christian Old Testament. 2. They are very similar to the way the story of Jesus was written. This is significant, the scholars claim, because it means that the story of Jesus came out of a common tradition of stories at the time. Thus, some would say, Jesus was simply just another revolutionary prophet trying to overthrow the Roman empire in Israel. For a Muslim today the main significance is mostly the fact that a Jewish artifact was found in Israel. This is evidence that a Zionist could use to claim a right to modern day Israel. Of course this would ignore the fact that Muslims also have a cultural and historical claim to the region. I hope this helps.|`|7413666614efe2e8d341deb5421ebbe2aa	In my opinion it doesn't really mean anything to us. Has anyone read the suprising similarities between the miracles that Prophet Elisha and Prophet Isa (PBUTB) did (Old Testament, Nehemia I think).|`|dKcuifiZaa	Faith explained it well.

Possibly a negation of all your deeply held--and now erroneous---beliefs?  Perhaps an end to your inherent hatred of Christians, and your backward beliefs in Man's superiority and dominance over women?  It may even force you into this century.|`|UhyvM73iaa	Aaccording to what Allah says in Quran, it means that  it is   fake tablet  created by Christians not earilier than the birth of Jesus but lot later to support their belief that  Jesus did die and resurrected himself after three days.  Muslims certainly will not accept this tablet to be written before Jesus was born.|`|99b9d77532164e17cd232b5ac3234a62aa	The article just refers to Jews and Christians.  Though those religions are related to Islam, if I'm not mistaken (believe in the same God and all that), it appears as if the content of the stone slab that was discovered won't really affect Islamic beliefs very much.  Then again, I cannot pretend to know how it will affect the Muslim society.|`|UppSUs2Baa	There's many such "coincidences" between Judaeo-Christian traditions and those traditions which preceded them.     There was an interesting documentary a few months ago which said that the Biblical account of Jesus is actually very similar to Krishna in the Hindu tradition.    The tablet found is just another coincidence which should have NO impact on Islam. If the biblical account of Jesus is the product of intertextuality, then it refutes his resurrection and divinity within the Christian faith, something which could be detrimental.    Peace

petbyWWOaa	yo te puedo decir que Dios si existe, dices que no se puede demostrar y eso no es verdad porque Santo Tomas de aquino formulo las cinco vias para la demostracionde Dios usando la teoria Arittelica del primer motor inmovil.  via 1 : movimiento: nos queda claro que todas las cosas se mueven, pero este movimiento es causado por otra cosa que la meve y asi hasta el infinito, pero este movimiento tiene un principio que es Dios el motor generador de todo movimiento y no movido.  via 2: eficiencia: toda causa eficiente es originada de otra y si no hay una causa primera no hay una causa ultima y esta causa primera es lo que llamamos Dios.  via 3: contingencia: todos los seres son contingentes estan ahora pero despues no, tiene la posibilidad de no existir y el tener esta posibilidad de no ser hace que no existiera en un tiempo, ejemplo tu no existias hasta tu nacimiento y no existiras cuando mueras. entonces se necesita un ser que sea necesario y que nos es contingente para crear a los seres contingentes ese es Dios.  via 4: grados de perfeccin: hay cosa mas perfectas y menos perfectas, pero para dar estos grados necesitamos un ser sumamente perfecto para ser usado como medida de perfeccin, este ser es Dios.  via 5: finalidad: vemos que todos los organismos tienen una finalidad pero hay organismos que carecen de inteligencia y necesitan ser guiados por otro ser mas inteligente, y hay un ser sumamente inteligente que da orden a todo diriguiendolo a su fin.  espero que te sirva esta respuesta y si quieres decir lo contrario usa argumentos como lo hice yo.|`|n30xWjHpaa	el que cree,,, es por que no sabe.. asi de facill    ej:  Yo creo que hoy va a llover...    tal vez llueva o tal vez no.....

UNA DEMOSTRACION DE QUE EXISTE ES QUE TODOS LOS QUE LO NIEGAN, COMO FERNANDO, COMO EL QUE PREGUNT, VIVEN. EL DIOS EN EL QUE CREEMOS ES DIOS DE VIDA, DIOS DE AMOR, DIOS DE MISERICORDIA, DIOS DE CONFIANZA. SI NO EXISTIERA DIOS, INCLUSO LOS QUE LO NIEGAN, NO VIVIRAN. Y SI QUIEREN DEMOSTRARLO, INTENTENLO. SI CREEN QUE SOLO SON MATERIA, INTENTEN DEJAR DE RESPIRAR Y SI ESA MATERIA QUE ES SU CUERPO, VUELVE EN SI, COMO SI REGRESARA DE UN SUE?O, ENTONCES DEMOSTRARAN USTEDES, QUE DIOS NO EXISTE Y QUE LA MATERIA ES SUFICIENTE PARA VIVIR.

Muy facil, ante todo tienes que tener FE, no sabes que es la fe? la Fe es la certeza de lo que se espera, es decir, la conviccin de lo que no se ve. Ahora, muchas de las personas siguen los lineamientos del dicho: "Ver para creer"; dicho que puede ser aplicable en el mundo natural, pero en lo espiritual no es as, tu puedes pedirle muchas cosas a Dios para tu vida, pero alla en el cielo Dios solamente escucha solamente murmullos, no puede oirte muy bien. Pero si tu le pides con Fe, con la conviccion de que te va a cumplir lo que le pediste, el te escucha y lo dar por hecho. SI PUEDES CREER EN LO QUE NO SE VE, SERAS BENDECIDO POR NUESTRO DIOS PADRE. Te lo digo yo, que soy un hombre grandemente bendecido por Dios, porque ando en su camino. Acepta a Jesucristo en tu corazn y vers que tu vida cambiar para bien. Dios te bendiga.  |`|u8PwhBkBaa	 1- es distinto creer que acegurar ?  respuesta:si    por eso Dios pide fe y no creencia..    2-nadie tiene por que acegurarte nada|`|hwELScCJaa	no puedes sentirlo porque no se lo has pedido, fastidialo todos los dias pidiendole eso, q te de pruebas de que existe y ya vas a ver que sorpresita te vas a llevar para que veas que si...........y bueno para que estes totalmente seguro espera a que te mueras para que lo puedas ver en espiritu! suerte!!|`|ziNbCEj3aa	Abre tu corazon, JUDAS , no tu mente.|`|cFpHo1g2aa	LA FE ES LA COVICCION DE LO QUE SE ESPERA Y LA CERTESA DE LO QUE NO SE VE POR LO TANTO  EN LO QUE CREO PUEDO SEGURAR  Y AHI NO HAY NINGUNA DUDA  ENTONCES CUANDO DEJES DE DUDAR VAS A SENTIR Y NO SOLAMENTE ESO  SINO QUE TU SEGURIDAD TE VA A TRAER DE LO INTANGIBLE LO TANGIBLE|`|TBcyEUm3aa	dios existe y te lo aseguro|`|YzPBBaZsaa	 yo creo  por fe y la fe me lleva a asegurar|`|AYtDccstaa	a visto el aire?  no crees ke exista   estas seguro que existe  porque?  porque se siente  dios existe porque se siente  y te lo estoy asegurando porlo a prueva y veras solo dejate sentir|`|vEVlMvvqaa	As es, solo creemos, eso es la religin: creencia y dogma.

Como aseguras tu que existes?, que es existir?, que es la vida?, existen multiples realidades?, existen otros seres en el universo?, existen otros universos?, como aseguras su existencia si tienes una peque?a vision del todo?.                           Solo imaginate este dilema de la fisica.                           Cuando dejas caer una piedra, existen 3 puntos de vistas:  1- Estando tu como observador en la tierra, puedes observar como la tierra atrae a la piedra.  2- Estando tu como observador en la piedra, puedes observar como la piedra atrae a la tierra.  3- Estando tu en la Luna, puedes observar como la tierra  y la piedra se atraen entre si.                             Ahora bien cual es la realidad verdadera?, las 3 son afirmaciones validas de la realidad existente, pero solo en su universo, pues mira como cambia de manera tan rapida la realidad con tan solo cambiar de posicion como observador, pero sin dudas puedes asegurar que tu realidad es la correcta, pero si no tienes un panorama mas amplio de la misma nunca sabras la verdad, y jamas tendras las facultades de afirmar que tu realidad es valida como tal.                            Pues lo mismo se puede aplicar a la existencia de Dios, como asegurar su existencia, si apenas tienen una vision diminuta del macrouniverso donde el mismo se encuentra incrustado.                            La verdad absoluta del dilema fisico de la piedra que cae es la tercera observacion, ambos cuerpos se atraen entre si.                            Peque?o mortal tus ojos solo ven lo que tu deseas que vean, pero los ojos de la razon pueden ver mas alla, mucho mas lejo, mucho mas claro, y mucho mas preciso, la realidad que nos rodea.

Por otro lado, por que tengo que demostrarte yo si Dios existe o no?   Es lo mismo que me pidieras que te ense?e a tener fe. Y la fe se tiene o no. Crees o no. Y punto. Por que buscarle la vuelta a un asunto tan trillado, si siempre vamos a caer en lo mismo: Crees...? Bien! No crees...? Tambin est bien!

Sal. 19:1: Los cielos estn declarando la gloria de Dios; y de la obra de sus manos la expansin est informando.    Sal. 104:24: ?Cuntas son tus obras, oh Jehov! Con sabidura las has hecho todas.

Se que sabes que existe el amor, pero me podras decir cmo es el amor, de qu color es, qu aspecto tiene, su tama?o, su dimensin, su forma ? Lo mismo se podra decir del odio, del mal, del bien, de la bondad, de la paz etc, todos las sentimos y convivimos con ellas, pero nadie puede determinar como son, porque nadie las ha visto, pero existen, porque se sienten.    En el caso de Dios, aunque no comprendas el trmino, Dios es un ser espiritual,as como los ngeles, demonios. Son seres que no tienen cuerpo fsico, ni aspecto fsico, pero si tienen cualidades que ostentan los seres fsicos, como ver, pensar, razonar, amar y tienen poderes de igual manera espirituales que trascienden lo fsico y material que solo se pueden percibir de la misma manera, por el espritu de los seres humanos que hacen parte de su personalidad.    Los creyentes, creemos en Dios por medio de la fe ( es un don especial dado por Dios) y a travs de ella, sentimos su manifestaciones y sus poderes que se traducen en bendiciones fsicas y espirituales.    No hay prueba fsica de la existencia de Dios como tal, por lo ya dicho, es un ser espiritual, pero sabemos de su existencia por las obras razonables y ordenadas que afectan la vida diaria, demostrando una inteligencia superior por medio de sus leyes fsicas, morales y espirituales que rigen el universo.    Los creyentes no estamos interesados en demostrar la existencia de Dios, lo damos por sentado, lo creemos,  lo sentimos y percibimos a travs del espritu, si alguna persona piensa que estamos equivocados de su existencia, que nos demuestre lo contrario, que no existe, mientras esto no se de, Dios vive y existente para siempre.|`|uXeCELKdaa	y tendra que hacerlo?  cuando yo leo tu pregunta creo que no sos capaz de demostrar la existencia de un diccionario  sabes que significa la palabra "creencia"? |`|Ashn1KPYaa	Porque yo no necesito demostrar a nadie.

Se han cumplido tantas cosas de las que pido, que yo no necesito que baje del Cielo para creerlo, porque lo siento. Si tu tuvieras el mnimo deseo de sentir a Dios, lo sentiras, ?qu te pasa? Que no aceptas que haya algo superior a ti y a todos, que no aceptas que pueda hacer lo que quiera.

Para qu?. Pero para entenderla ben, por que, ests tentado a pensar que una cosa es lo que "sabes" y otra lo que "crees" y que ambas se oponen, pero no es as, porque la mayor cantidad de cosas de la vida las sabes por F, incluso lo humano. Desde quienes son ts padres hasta con quien vas a embarcar definitivamente t vida en matrimonio. Osea, creemos en algo o alguien porque tenemos confianza, nos fiamos mediante una opcin de aceptacin fiada en una serie de detalles que nos inclinan a ello.  Adems si nos remontamos en la historia, la Sagradas escrituras datan hace ms de 2000 a?os, y se empezaron a escribir despus de la crucificacin de Jess.-  As nos dejan en los escritos, que un ser Todopoderoso, Creador del Cielo y de la Tierra, prepara a una mujer Mara, para ser concebida por obra y Gracia del Espirit Santo, sin acceso carnal y da a luz a un ni?o llamado Jess, y en su alumbramiento, la Madre mantiene el himn sano, de ah la Virgen Mara, esto est aprobado por telogos que estudian a la Santa Mara. Sino como explicaras que un hombre como nosotros, tuvieras tantos poderes para curar un leproso, dar vista a un ciego, hacer salir agua de un pozo donde jams podra haber agua, no era un ilusionista, era el hijo de Dios, y ofrendo su vida para la salvacin y perdn de los pecados.  A partir del 86 D.C, se van dando, basada en la Santa escritura la dems religiones, que veneran a un mismo Dios, nace la Evanglica, Ortodoxa, Testigo de Jehov, Mormn, etc; las que creen siempre en un Dios y no en Santos, ni Angeles.- Hasta los Judios tienen el mismo Dios.-  Los primeros libros fueron escritos por sus Apstoles despus de 40  50 a?os.-  Si te remitis a la mitologa griegas ellos tambien hablan de Dios, con el nombre de Zeus, y los primeros seres humano que crea son Pandora y Epimeteo; algo as como nuestro Adn y Eva, entonces es todo cuestin de F.  Ahora te comento un mito: Pandora fu dotada de muchos dones por todos los dioses, pero se le di una urna de oro cerrada advirtindole que no deba abrirla jams. Epimeteo no quera saber nada con desobedecer a los seres superiores a los que haba pertenecido hasta enamorarse de Pandora, pero ella no aguant la curiosidad.   Hasta que un da, retiro la tapa de aquella urna y vi, con espanto, como salan de ella todos los males desconocidos hasta entonces: el egosmo,la vanidad, la ira, la lujuria, la envidia, el odio, la muerte y todas las lacras que hoy conocemos se desparramaron en un santiamn.   Cuando la mujer mir el interior, vi que, en el fondo, los dioses permitieron que quedara acurrucada y solitaria la ESPERANZA.  Coloc otra vez la tapa, rpidamnete, y all quedo para todos los tiempos,guardada para ser usada cuando la necesitara aquella impresionante Virtud.  La ESPERANZA no se perdi a pesar del castigo de lo Dioses Griegos. All sigue estando.  Bueno, hay un montn para hablar, espero te sea til.-  Si sos Catlico Apostlico, te recomiendo la pelcula "LA PASION", ah te ayuda entender mejor del porque.-  Un abrazo.-|`|YG47w1QSaa	precisamente porque el no poder demostrarlo y comprenderlo es muestra del poder y la superioridad de dios sobre el hombre, algo parecido al dogma de la trinidad.    es un invento de esta bonita religion para estafar a la gente, solo dios puee comprenderlo, pero eske lo que hay que comprender es si existe dios, si crees en dios tienes que creer en su superioridad y en que por ello no puedes comprender a dios, porque eres inferior a el, y si sigues razonando veras que nunca llegas a ninguna parte. es una espiral infinita. los teologos antiguos intentaron demostrar su existencia por todos los medios posibles, y nunca llegaron a ninguna parte. la explicacion: dios es demasiado poderoso como para que los humanos inferiores podamos comprenderle.    los padres del cristianismo fueron bastante listos en ese sentido...|`|raQ5GpzIaa	el aire no lo vez mas sin envargo lo sientes, y asi es mi concepcion de el creador o el gran arquitecto del universo, El esta ahi y yo lo siento cuando veo una flor veo los colores del arcoiris etc. no estoy de acuerdo en decir que hay que temerle, porque? a mis padres los amo pero no les temo y porque a El si?

ATPPWOpWaa	Good question.    The answer is yes and no.   We would naturally 'act' better in His presence.  Although its not possible for us to be anywhere near perfect.    Remember that all throughout world history that there has never been anyone that could be sinless in the presence of God/Jesus in the few instances stated in the Bible.    Even the apostle Paul who was in the presence of Jesus and was given the Gospel by direct revelation said this during his ministry afterward.    Romans 7    10  I (Paul) found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.     11For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death. 12So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good. 13Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.     14We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 15I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. 16And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. 17As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. 18I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature.[c] For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 19For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to dothis I keep on doing. 20Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.     21So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me. 22For in my inner being I delight in God's law; 23but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members. 24What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 25Thanks be to Godthrough Jesus Christ our Lord!|`|mJrKfFLJaa	You know I would.  Then it would not be a faith journey would it.

Check out Revelation 20-21    Revelation 20   1And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.      2And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,      3And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.      4And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.      5But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.      6Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.      7And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,      8And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.      9And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.      10And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.      11And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.      12And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.      13And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.      14And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.      15And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.    Revelation 21   1And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.      2And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.      3And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.      4And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.      5And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.      6And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.      7He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.      8But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.      9And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.      10And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,      11Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;      12And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:      13On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.      14And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.      15And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.      16And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.      17And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.      18And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.      19And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones.

Every other person who has claimed to be Jesus has either been regarded as a heretic or a lunatic, why should it change just because He really appears?   What if he comes back in a form we refuse to recognize, like a Native American Woman? I expect that if Jesus does return people will kill him again.  And besides, Christians refuse to recognize that he already had his second coming. He told his disciples he would return during their lifetimes, and so he did. He arose from the dead and hung out with the disciples for 40 days before he ascended to Heaven. These people read the Bible, but they sure don't understand it.|`|imWxnK2saa	I would welcome him and would ask him to make me an instrument of his peace. I would love to live to see the day.

dOXUYv0Xaa	A human being must become a master of the 'cycle' known as 'human emotions'.  The emotions have been known to push and pull a human being in a multitude of directions, much like a beautiful flower that gets caught in a blowing wind.  ~~~~~  The inner heart of a human being is another story all together.  It can be always closed or it can be allowed to open.  When it is allowed to open, growth and development will then take place and it will blossom.  Eventually the inner heart must be surrendered.  When the inner heart has been surrendered, the emotions will not succumb to the harshest of blowing winds.  Then a human being will truly "feel" with the inner heart!    This is the task of all those that have been born as human beings!    Peace be always with you.

However, when any one of them is undeveloped, that person is incomplete and unbalanced.  Then damage is done to themselves and to those around them, and full respond-ability to God/Source falls short.      Many with one or another of these undeveloped aspects of themselves do not realize the full extent of their impairment, perhaps thinking they can make up for one lack by relying on the other bodies.  But, this is an impossibility, for it is the whole being that must become synchronized with All That Is and, of course, with other human beings.    One in particular i have known who. incapable of developing the feeling body (and openly admitting it to me), is crippled in the forming of and maintaining of relationships.  Out of a traumatic abandonment by his mother, this one has never been able to fully trust females...his heart is well-guarded against any repetition of the childhood betrayal.  While he sees and presents himself as a spiritual master and teacher, he has not developed this emotional facet of himself and is, therefore, a walking wounded masquerading as a harmonious whole.  He cannot see the harm that he has done as he misrepresents himself and manipulates others to his will.      All beings must first know love/passion (based initially on the ego's personal interests), and from that experience, move further into compassion (which expands the ability to love...from one's personal self interests to consideration of others' well-being).  This increased opening of the heart is a progression in development toward ultimate realization of oneness...when the heart has fully flowered (opened) one is ready to be in alignment and service to Source/All That Is.    The physical, mental, and emotional bodies, when properly evolved and perfected, are to be used for and dedicated to the good of all beings.  Without a well-developed feeling body a true connection to and harmony with others is impossible.  It is essential for self-realization and for planetary transformation, as well.      i am Sirius|`|TnquzeM5aa	My task is to get control of my emotions before I start whoopin some asses....|`|iVv6bFW2aa	To love others, especially the poor, to empathize with others, to not let anger dominate, to be understanding and not loose one's temper, to be altruistic This can be achieved by a loving religion, upbringing and one's own efforts|`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	I can't speak for men, because I'm not one.

It is contained in one's heart and mind. Religious believers would add that it can be found in Jesus, salvation , prayer,and the conversion of others. Not being religious I prefer the first definition to the second.However each individual  must find his or her happiness in his/her  own way, except by not hating or hurting others. |`|mJrKfFLJaa	Happiness is societal and cultural.  It is also found sociologically.    Watching the Red Army march in front of the Kremlin may be bring happiness to you however it may strike terror in another's heart.    True happiness is found only being reunited with the creator God through the second person of the Blessed Trinity namely The Lord Jesus, the Christ.    John 14: 27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.  DFF

The only thing that i am offered to substantiate his existence is a book.....a book that says it true.... am i supposed to beleive a book simply because it says its true??? espacially when it says that snakes can talk, people can live in a whales mouth, and dinosaur fossiles were placed in the ground by the devil...why did i have to give up santa clause if i have to beleive in this crap?!?!?!  Mabey i should right a book saying that god said that i am divine and deserve $20 everyday at noon, god says the book is true so it must be true right? His ways sure are mysteriouse....    but then that was a long time ago, ive come up with alot more reasons not to beleive scince then. Currently i am an agnostic, i accept that i do not know fully whether god exists or not, but im positive that the bible is a fairy tale book that is way to overrated.
AA10082646	Most definately Italian.  You have more reasons to choose Italian and especially since your aunt speaks italian, that would be extremely helpful.  When you say the teacher is kind of mean, seriously, don't take that into consideration if coming from other students!  I had numerous students tell me before i started my freshman year that my biology teacher was a horrible and mean teacher.. well it turns out he really wasn't. He's actually one of my best teachers.

I mean, I'm not like super rich or anything, I'm just like  middle class, but I use my money wisely.  So no, I don't think that people wear it to just show off their wealth. I know that I don't.

AJKb3Gecaa	I think you should try and meet your father if you can and hear his side of the story, maybe your mother is right and he's not worth knowing or maybe they had a misunderstanding or were not meant for one another.    If he dies and you haven't got to know him you will spend the rest of your life wondering about what he was like.|`|D9LO2Y2Uaa	You should see him, besides you are 21 years old.  NO mother has a right to deny a father's right to visit his own children.  |`|385371073e8d53b7e0a56851b570adabaa	Go and find your Dad. Your mum looks upset because she knows that deep down she is the selfish and self serving one.  She had no right to prevent you from seeing your father.  She used you and your brother as a weapon against your father to hurt him for her own purposes.  He will no doubt be delighted to build a relationship with you.  Good luck.|`|21b94e2fb3b79b6681e94b64cd989ab0aa	I agree that you need to seek your father out and find out what his side of the story was, but you need to also work on forgiving your mom.  I can't condone what she did, but the anger and hurt are trapping you in misery.  She may be so blinded by her own hurt and anger at your dad, that she never stopped to think about how it would affect her children to keep him away.  At the same time, he has had legal options that he could have pursued to get visitation, but eh never chose to do that, either, so that's something you'll have to ask him about when you find him.|`|PoTeZQNqaa	Your question hit home with me. I  have been, or should I say; in the same situation as your father. I've been married 3 times, and have had a child by each. Funny as it seems that, all the "mommies wanted the babies for themselves! "Daddy apparently was not supposed to be part of the equation until it came time to SUPPORT the child. That was what they were looking for!  I could write a book on this , but for now, suffice it to say that if your Dad Wanted or was trying to see you ...... never let go of that. Mainly because you don't know the WHOLE story!!!|`|cmG8uI1baa	You mother might be right, but i think that you should go and visit your father because after all he is still your father and you have every right, to at least see him once... I think he would wanna see you, you are his daughter no matter what.|`|108dd144b67a8cb2a13f084607bb9925aa	Take the opportunity to meet your father and begin a relationship.  It's never too late.  Granted, you lost a lot of quality time.  I went through the same thing as a child.  My father never called, wrote, etc.  The only connection I had to him was hearing updates about him from my paternal grandfather, while I lived with my mom and maternal grandmother (who had no use for my dad).  Long story short, I had been told he was simply a useless, selfish man who didn't want the responsibilities of fatherhood.  He never paid child support.  When I got older, close friends of our family confided that my mom had actually made a "deal" with my Dad -- if you agree not to see visitation, I won't enforce the child support measure.   Admittedly, I could be mad because essentially my Dad opted to avoid contact with me to save a few bucks.  But, in the end, it was my mom and grandmother that were lying to me about him.  I suppose they had their own concerns and reasons.  Regardless, we met several times once I was an adult, talked on the phone a few times a year, and I even got to meet his new family (remarried and she had her own kids).  When he passed away, I went to the hospital to see him before his surgery and he told me he wanted me and his wife to be the decision makers on when to take him off support.  Shows you how much you can accomplish in a relationship regardless of the past, or how much time was lost.  We'll always have that bond...short lived as it was.  Mom and Grandma were pretty neutral to his death (Grandma blamed it on his irresponsible living).  So, no change there, but at least he and I were at peace about things.|`|iUzSlmSbaa	I believe your dad hurt your mom a lot by walking out.. but even though I understand her hurting.. this has happened to a million relationships.. if he came back to ask about you and your brother.. now that you are aged 21 you have a legal right to know where your dad is.. and talk to him.. you have a right to form your own opinion about him by talking to him in person... at age 21 your mom has no right to keep the truth from you.. she feels hurt that he left.. but you need to know that every coin has two sides and before you get mad at either her or him.. you need to know the true story.. I believe they just drifted apart.. and she took it hard.. and he probaby paid no alimony.. maybe he cheated on her.. that gives her a right to feel upset about him.. but it doesn't really give you the right to withhold information from you which may lead you to your dad.. if she is so sure he is ''no good'' she has nothing to fear.. I believe the hatchet should be buried after all those years and your mom will only keep you searching and guessing so make things a lot worse.. instead of telling you and you meet him and form your own opinion.. you are an adult and no longer a child.. she doesn't have the right to withhold this info from you .. no matter how much she herself was emotionally hurt by his leaving...she owes you and your brother to see both sides of the story.. and then for both of you to accept facts as they are... without dishing out blame to either one of them.. which you will keep on doing until you  get your answers.. for that reason alone.. she should answer your questions... so that you don't judge her and don't judge him until you know ... both sides...  xx|`|MJdUkar5aa	There may of course be some good reasons why she didn't want you to know your father while you were growing up. He might have been involved in criminal activities or something for all you know. However, you are now 21 and there is no reason why you can't get to know him now and make up your own mind about it. You might be able to track him down through an organisation such as the Salvation Army. There may be people around you who do know where he is and how to contact him.     It is now down to you to make the effort to find him if that is what you want. It is no longer up to your Mum. Maybe some of your other relatives, your Mum's brothers or sisters, or your grandparents might be able to tell you something about what he did for work, where he came from, where he lived etc. I think you will feel a lot better once you start seriously trying to find him and see if it is possible to establish some sort of relationship with him. However, you should also be prepared in case he doesn't want to have a relationship with you.

I'm not saying I disagree with Malcolm X in his later years, he was an amazing person, this just seems...I mean where to the Caribs, West Indians, Jamaicans, and Africans fit into this speech? The first few statements were so broad, and that's part of why I feel disconnected from the history of my own nation. It's like I don't get to be a part of my land or my blood.|`|vz8FyhBHaa	It's sad how Black people have been taught to look at Malcolm X through the eyes of mainstream white America. They look at him as though he was the anti-christ, then they turn around and look at MLK as if he was some kind of savior. Malcolm X's point was that we should be non-violent when trying to bring about change, but if our oppressor became violent, so should we in self-defense. He didn't teach hate, he taught self-defense. And that's why he's so hated by miseducated whites and Blacks. Because the only other alternative was MLK's plan which was to be non-violent regardless of what happened.    "Be peaceful, be courteous, obey the law, respect everyone; but if someone puts his hands on you, send him to the cemetery." - Malcolm X    They both had the same goal, just different views of how to go about getting things done.    |`|8a8c6129d92df8b6fab4d08bee1e988daa	if only we could imagine what it was like to be black in america 45 years ago. hmm|`|bVLWVonUaa	I personally do not agree with some of the things that Malcolm X believed in and said, but nonetheless I think that his ideas, experiences, and thoughts are quite fascinating and important to know about.  It really is just another person's opinion, but I have read his book (The Autobiography of Malcolm X) and I thought that it was absolutely amazing. I learned a lot and really think that despite the fact that he could be quite fierce compared to say MLK, I have a lot of respect for him. I do because I have always thought that he has a solid standing with what he believed in, meaning that he actually knew what he was talking about, unlike some people today. He was definitely an intelligent person. He left a lot of good ideas behind for us to contemplate over, learn from, and either reject or agree with, both of which are completely fine.|`|sdZHoiSyaa	We don't like white people because white people are not human.

However, they believe that those who do not want to "marry" in a church or cannot should be able to seek the same rights as marriage through a civil ceremony.  Thus, anybody not affiliated with a church could have a civil union (gay, or even straight couples who are simply not religious), and those in the church could "marry" according to the terms of their church.  Everybody would receive equal standing, i.e. there wouldn't be a difference in terms of legal rights between a marriage or civil union.    |`|bWbyi8thaa	in north florida and bible belt states i know of some that run small groups.they say its a sin/perversion they must live with and it should not interrupt Traditional ways. this is through years of programing from their parents though.lol crazy  my parents still (and always have since i was little) say me always being so femme girl like is a perversion. whatever, i don't have time to worry what others think.|`|eCltSlPxaa	It's totally her opinion.

Wright's controversial sermon was very powerful when heard in context:      http://www.democraticcentral.com/showDia...      "And the United States of America government, when it came to treating her citizens of Indian descent, she failed. She put them on reservations.   When it came to putting her citizens of Japanese descent fairly, she failed. She put them in interment prison camps.   When it came to putting the citizens of African descent fairly, America failed. She put them in chains. The government put them on slave quarters. Put them on auction blocks. Put them in cotton fields. Put them in inferior schools. Put them in substandard housing. Put them scientific experiments. Put them in the lower paying jobs. Put them outside the equal protection of the law. Kept them out of their racist bastions of higher education, and locked them into positions of hopelessness and helplessness.   The government gives them the drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a three strike law and then wants us to sing God Bless America. Naw, naw, naw. Not God Bless America. God Damn America! That's in the Bible. For killing innocent people. God Damn America for treating us citizens as less than human. God Damn America as long as she tries to act like she is God and she is Supreme.   The United States government has failed the vast majority of her citizens of African descent. Think about this. Think about this. For every one Oprah, a billionaire, you've got 5 million blacks that are out of work. For every one Colin Powell, a millionaire, you've got 10 million blacks who cannot read. For every one Condi-Skeezer Rice, you've got 1 million in prison. For every one Tiger Woods, who needs to get beat at the Masters, with his Cablanasian hips, playing on a course that discriminates against women, God has this way of bringing you up short when you get too big for your Cablanasian britches. For every one Tiger Woods, we've got 10,000 black kids who will never see a golf course. The United States government has failed the vast majority of her citizens of African descent.   Tell your neighbor he's (going to) help us one last time. Turn back and say forgive him for the God Damn, that's in the Bible though. Blessings and curses is in the Bible. It's in the Bible.   Where government fail, God never fails. When God says it, it's done. God never fails. When God wills it, you better get out the way, cause God never fails. When God fixes it, oh believe me it's fixed. God never fails. Somebody right now, you think you can't make it, but I want you to know that you are more than a conqueror through Christ. You can do all things through Christ who strengthens you."|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	Since he has chosen to ignore that and judge others, then the others have the right to do the same to him.

Now he is condemning Wright's sermons. I wonder why  now?    Obama said Jeremiah Wright led him to the Lord and discipled him.  A  disciple is one in training. Jesus told us in Matthew 28:19 - 20 'Go and  make disciples of all nations.' This means reproduce yourself. Teach people  to think like you, walk like you; talk like you believe what you believe  etc.  The question I have is what did Jeremiah Wright teach him?    Would you support a White President who went to a church which has tenets  that said they have a  1. Commitment to the White Community  2. Commitment to the White Family  3. Adherence to the White Work Ethic  4. Pledge to make the fruits of all developing and acquired skills available  to the White Community.  5. Pledge to Allocate Regularly, a Portion of Personal Resources for  Strengthening and Supporting White Institutions  6. Pledge allegiance to all White leadership who espouse and embrace the  White Value System  7. Personal commitment to embracement of the White Value System.    Would you support a President who went to a church like that?    Just change the word from white to black and you have the tenets of Obama's  former church.  If President Bush was a member of a church like this, he  would be called a racist. Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton would have been  marching outside.    This kind of church is a racist church. Obama did not wake up after 20 years  and just discover he'd been going to a racist church.  The TRUE church can't  be about race.  Jesus did not come for any particular race. He came for the  whole world.    A church can't have a value system based on race. The churches value system  has to be based on biblical mandates. It does not matter if it's a white  church or a black church based on racial values, it's still wrong.  Anyone  from either race that attends a church like this would never get my vote|`|AA11476749	Jeremiah Wright claims to be a believer.  Within the church, we are to judge one another's behavior (not heart).  (Cf. I Corinthians 5:12)    As far as the verses that you are alluding to, these come from Matthew 7:1ff.  Allow me to give you some info regarding that passage.    The Greek word for judge there is "krino," (Strong's  2929) and means "to distinguish, i.e. decide (mentally or judicially); by implication, to try, condemn, punish..."    So, when Jesus was speaking of not judging someone, it was about condemnation. In other words, we don't decide who is going to hell. That judgment is left to Him alone.    Now, in the I Corinthians 2:15 passage, that has more to do with discernment. The Greek word is "anakrino," (Strong's  350) of which "krino" is a root. The implications are different, though. It means "to scrutinize, i.e. (by implication) investigate, interrogate, determine..."    This has to do with observing facts, and making a determination.    In the case of the I Corinthian 5:5 passage, Paul does use "krino," He further qualifies that the judgment is so he can be saved ultimately, so even then, he is not condemning the man to hell.|`|3942e77c035cfc36aa7643acff17d6bcaa	First of all, he was the one doing the negative judging that many patriotic people objected to. So, he was Wright and he was wrong. I went to one of his sermons at a shelter in Chicago and he told the homeless people that if they didn't go back to work, that god was going to evict them from their bodies. His delivery is more like a shock jock.
9MhdJ1YDaa	There is no reference to purgatory in scripture. It was formulated by Gregory the Great in 593, and later made an official dogma at the Council of Florence, 1439    The Bible states that once we become a Christian, all sin (and all penalty for sin)  is removed    1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.|`|LYnuEdKUaa	Sure can, but keep in mind that you're going to have to do more than a surface read of the verses to see purgatory.

If you need explanations as to why one of the verses does this, head over to the forums at catholic.com and ask.  They'd be happy to explain in detail.

I've been saved in april of 2007. Since the time i've gotten saved, I've been going 2-3 time a week to church and have fellowship with my youth group. It was a church that God put me in. Now I moved to Tx and Im still managing to keep my faith strong and I keep in touch with many of my church members in Ga. I watch sermons on CD every sunday in my room and keep up with the bible. I'm only 16 and my family isnt saved yet so it's hard and kinda easy at the same time. God will give us lots of tests and we have to choose the wise things for the glory of God. I think you are doing a great job studying the bible and praying to God. To me, yes... churches can be alittle different. I just believe that a true church is where you follow the bible and spreading the word to others... not to go there and gossip and give out so much money... You should pray for a church as well so you can have fellowship. I think someone's been praying for you so you may know God.

By self-preparation in advance of such meetings, one can make it very evident that one does not desire to neglect the house of our God. One thus reveals that one goes to meetings, not just as a matter of routine, indifferently, but with a purpose, the purpose of being spiritually built up oneself and of building up the other members of Gods household. One can thus aid in keeping the congregation strong in faith, hope and courage, yes, aid in growing stronger in these vital things. One can watch to keep the purity of the congregation, not alone the purity of the faith as it was once for all time delivered to the holy ones, but also the purity of the personal life in a moral sense. This calls for a person to put up a hard fight in a spiritual way, making full use of the complete suit of armor from God and fighting side by side for the faith of the good news. (Jude 3; Eph. 6:11-17; Phil. 1:27) This helps to keep Gods house in good repair spiritually.|`|0eba0c37213d06a8de73db765ea13cc0aa	Yes, true salvation is in getting saved, but in order to grow spiritually, you need to be in church.

Good luck!|`|AA10024451	Hebrews 10:24, 25 tells us that Christians are not to forsake the gathering of themselves together, for the inciting of one another to "love and fine works". How exactly can you do that without meeting with fellow Christians?     (Your belief in Jesus Christ does not make you 'saved' right now. The Bible teaches no such thing. What it does teach is "he who endures to the end is the one that will be saved". Since the end hasn't come yet, those who endure and remain faithful to God and obedient to Christ will be the ones that will end up saved. You are NOT saved right now.)|`|CjRfJbncaa	"In order to be a true Christian, do you have to go to church?"    "Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works,   not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near." --Hebrews 10:24,25    But---Should You Belong to a *Church*?   - How God Dealt With People in the Past   - God has long dealt with his people as an organized group.     http://watchtower.org/e/20040601/article...    Does Jehovah have as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Look! To obey is better than a sacrifice, to pay attention than the fat of rams.1 Samuel 15:22    "...True worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and *truth*, for, indeed, the Father is looking for suchlike ones to worship him.  God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him *must* worship with spirit and truth." --John 4:23,24      "My mother-in-law is always telling us that we HAVE to go to church or we'll go to hell."     "The modern English word Hell is derived from Old English hel, helle (about 725 AD) and ultimately from Proto-Germanic halja, meaning 'one who covers up or hides something' ".  (Wikipedia)    'Hell' often described the storage of potatoes, underground or in a cellar--both of which are cool, dark, peaceful places.  'Hell' was used to replace the word, 'grave', in a certain Bible---in place of the original: Sheol (Hebrew), &, hades (Greek).      What Has Happened to Hellfire?   - What Really Is Hell?    http://watchtower.org/e/20020715/article...      Now, notice how God's Word describes  the condition of the dead:       "...The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages . . .  Also, their love and their hate and their jealousy have already perished . . ." --Ecclesiastes 9:5    ". . .There is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol, the place to which you are going." --Ecclesiastes 9:10   NWT    "Man came to be a living soul." --Genesis 2:7b  'The first man Adam *became a living soul* . . ." -- 1 Corinthians 15:45,      "The soul that is sinning---*it itself* will die." --Ezekiel 18:4      "You will ... return to the ground, for out of it you were taken.   For dust you are and to dust you will return." --Genesis 3:19       Do You Have an Immortal Soul?      http://watchtower.org/e/20070715/article...      "I have been to many different denominations and they all seem to interpret the Bible differently. It was frustrating. I thought, 'there is something wrong with this picture'."    Notice what Jesus Christ said about & to the religious leaders of his time, & ours:    Many will say to me: Lord, did we not prophesy, expel demons, & perform many powerful works in your name?  Yet I will confess to them: I never knew you! Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness. --Matthew 7:21-23      "You hypocrites, Isaiah aptly prophesied about you: This people honors me with their lips, yet their heart is far removed from me.  It is in vain that they keep worshiping  . . because *they teach commands of men* as doctrines*.  --Matthew 15:7,8     "Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples, saying:  The scribes and the Pharisees have *seated themselves* in the seat of Moses.  Therefore all the things they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds, for *they say but do not perform*. . .   All the works they do they do to be viewed by men . . .  They like the most prominent place at evening meals and the front seats in the synagogues,  and the greetings in the marketplaces and to be called Rabbi by men.  But . . .  Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted." --Matthew 23:1-12    http://watchtower.org/bible/mt/chapter_0...    "For false Christs and false prophets will arise and give great signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the chosen ones.  Watch out! I have forewarned you." --Matthew 24:24,25 & Mark 13:22      Several early followers of Christ added similar warnings, for example:    ". . . These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects . . .  Furthermore, many will follow their acts of loose conduct, and on account of these the way of the truth will be spoken of abusively.  Also, with covetousness they will exploit you with counterfeit words . . ." --2 Peter 2:1-3      From among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves. --Ac 20:29,30    "Look out: perhaps there may be someone who will carry you off as his prey through the philosophy & empty deception according to tradition of men...  not according to Christ." --Colossians 2:8    "Certain men have slipped in . . . ungodly men, turning the undeserved kindness of our God into an excuse for loose conduct and proving false to our only Owner and Lord, Jesus Christ." -- Jude 4    Test the inspired expressions to see whether they originate with God, because many false prophets have gone forth into the world." --1 John 4:1      This is the reason why you are learning more from your personal study of God's Word in a short while, than you ever learned in any -or all-- of the churches you've attended.

Edit:  Savatore--excellent response.|`|QgqYcRcWaa	Up to October 2007, I still attended church and read the Bible but I did whatever gave me fun. But that time came when it dawned on me that I was destroying everything in my path becos of my selfish life..  What ever we call fun was given to us by GOD and He doesn't need any of them. For instance He never requested to have any girl I wanted, other men did.   Any thing GOD said we should not do is for our good; no body wants to have a broken heart, no body wants his daughter to be raped, no body wants his wife to be unfaithful, no body wants his property stolen...please tell me, which of these will make GOD less than God if we did them? So Jesus came to prepare our hearts to receive the Holy Spirit who then guides us away from doing evil to our neigbours and our selves. My life is lived so that I can have the Holy Spirit in me. If transmuted sin on the humanity of Jesus caused Him(Holy Spirit) to depart His eternal abode, how much more commited sin? Moreover I enjoy my communion with the Holy Spirit.  Further, Genesis 1:1-27 establishes GOD as our creator. In verse 27 it is recorded that He created us in His Image which include: holiness, righteousness, love, peace, forgiveness, kindness, gentleness, sincerity, etc. Every new born baby comes with these godly attributes and more but with no 'knowledge of evil' However Genesis 3:22 shows that the forbidden fruit expose man to the knowledge of evil and because he was not God he could not refrain from doing evil so much so GOD wipe away the whole of humanity except for Naoh.  Jesus came to restore you to that pristine innocence where what you say is what you mean. The world does not like Him because they can not measure upto His ideals. Those who accept Him as Lord, He helps to think and act like God. This is the essence of Christianity; being like God. That is what should govern your life not fear of punishment, however you should fear a man that hates sin so much He was willing to put His physical Essence on the alter in order to buy you the right to be like Him. This type of fear comes from love.|`|Shp5riE6aa	See you there.       |`|pgiGhD6Daa	I have figured out the meaning of life. It is the people you love.

IDWlqSY2aa	1950-  There was plenty of work after WW2. People were polite, little juvenile delinquency,  living expenses cheaper , neighbors helping neighbors when needed, schools had good discipline, the government didn't tell you how to raise your kids, parents were in control of the home, no young people on drugs, you could walk around the neighborhood as a child and was safe, food was grown in a garden even in town ( and tasted soo good) , people were more polite to one another, families got together more, both parents didn't have to work to keep the bills paid,  nursing homes were not the norm- children cared for their parents themselves.

They were much simpler times, the family unit was number one, the women stayed home to raise the children & take care of the home, the father was the breadwinner, & the respected head of the home. People knew their neighbors by first & last name, & neighbors helped neighbors. We, as children were happy with what we had & knew our parents were doing the best they could to give us the things we needed first, then we got some special things we wanted when our parents could afford to buy them. Families spent time together watching good & decent tv shows nightly.  They were family shows & we enjoyed that  time together. Families ate dinner together in the kitchen or dining room & talked about what kind of day we had. The tv was not on during mealtime, ever, in our home. I liked the fashions, music, hairstyles, etc. from the 50's & 60's. I got spending money for doing the assigned chores I did. I learned to help out around the house when needed & I expected no money for it. There were house rules, set down by my parents & when a rule was broken, I knew I was in trouble. There was a certain time to be home & I had better be home or expect to be punished. It's how I learned to listen to & respect what my parents said, as they knew best, loved me in their own way, & wanted me to be safe, even if I didn't think so. The music & dancing was the best then & the movies were great too. Those great times are gone forever but my memories live on & on.|`|8ca4e1bf1d27b6b183464e694ae56d4baa	Absolutely the '50's.  I grew up as a teenager in the 50's. The music in those days made sense and rock and roll was was making its appearance.  Elvis was all the rage.  Back then people were more laid back and one of the best things of all was that your mother was always home.  And if by some chance she wasn't and you had a problem there was always someone another kids  mother to help you.  No drugs either.  Teachers in those days didn't have to be afraid of a lawsuit if they had to discipline one of the kids.  And if they did have to, they sent word home to your mother and father and you "got it" again.  We knew everyone in town and everyone knew who you were.  We were safe and it was just a wonderful time to grow up.  I will never forget the 50's and I am thankful I was a part of such a great time. |`|GkH5NoFyaa	now.

People cared more about each other.  1970's: dating, getting married, having kids.   |`|SZudGT82aa	For me it's the 50's .   Great music, helpful neighbors, didn't have to lock our houses or cars because nobody  ever stold anything. Kids could play outside and run around the neighborhood freely because no one ever bothered them .People respected each other and kids respected their elders and minded them even if they were told to do something by someone other then their parent. Getting in trouble meant running through someones flowers or garden or maybe batting a ball through a window. It was a totally different world and a great time to be a kid. |`|raBE9OUiaa	wow i just read everyone else's answers.   you know i don't remember us locking doors when i was a kid. i don't remember women and girls wearing pants either. women wore dresses and had long hair. and kids didn't go around swearing and disrespecting their elders like they do now.  to answer your question i'm going to say the '50's and the '60's.  the 1960's minus the war anyway. on the other hand i wonder if we would have had the 'mini skirt' if it wasn't for the war?
cebae79e4998c747caf2aebf943562aeaa	it doesn't!    2 Cor 10:3  For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: 4  (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds;) 5  Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; 6  And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.     Eph 6:11  Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.   12  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.   13  Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.   14  Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;   15  And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;   16  Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.   17  And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:   18  Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;   |`|WUjlEuTtaa	It doesn't.

Jesus said we are to love our enemies and do good to those who mistreat us. We are to wage war against sin within ourselves, not in others. The warfare of a Christian is internal. It is the "plucking of the eye" and "severing of the hand" that causes you to sin.
LcYeN6m5aa	because according to the Law given by God, she would be cast out - and he would have remained alone in the Garden of Eden, but he was also commanded to remain with her because she was his wife and to be fruitful and multiply which he couldn't do if she was cast out....so he chose to partake of the fruit so he might remain with her so they could fulfill the commandment to be together and multiply.....and together they fell.....    *Edit* Just for fun - there isn't a single reference to what the fruit was.....some traditions hold it was an apple (hence Adam's Apple) others a fig, some a coconut, and one tradition from Assyria holds it was a giant mushroom.|`|AA10334284	well they were given perfection meaning a life with no physical pain, no pain just in general, a perfect life. no embarassment from not wearing clothes....ect.

Then later she was the one that mislead Adam.    The Serpent came to Eve and not to Adam.    The Scripture you used answered your question,    1 Ti 2:13,14 " For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.."    Eve was deceived first just like it says in this verse as well as in Geneses. Eve became a sinner when she believed the Serpent and then she deceived Adam.    EDIT----  Caroline    In Paul's letter to Timothy he was referencing to the occurrence in Genesis so what actually happened in Genesis must have a great amount of value and of course what Paul said to Timothy Parallels exactly what is in Genesis.      .|`|2CNqZKuLaa	they weren't made perfect, they were given free will and placed in a paradise free of pain to live their lives. they couldn't resist temptation and made their decisions to disobey...    the sin was both of theirs, no matter who went first or who was tricked or anything. they both made their own conscious decision.|`|xcds2eqhaa	well knowing how sneaky this question is proves that EVE not ADAM was the guilty little slut since poor ADAM did not know any better EVE guided him into the dirty little deed.  PS and I ain't talking apples honey  |`|eiKgbvYraa	This is just my view, but I think the way things were described in the bible has to do with the cultures of the time it was written. It was a very male focused society. Men were viewed as having the power AND the responsibility. Also, the snake succeeded in convincing Eve her actions would be justified, Eve simply gave the fruit to Adam and he ate it. He reply to God was, (to paraphrase) you gave me this woman and she gave me the fruit. So it's almost like he was trying to blame God. And I personally don't believe Adam and Eve were given perfection in spirit. If that was a reasonable course of action then why were we not ALL just given perfection from the out go. I think that Adam and Eve were given perfection in body. Which would explain (to my scientific mindedness) why those in the early periods in the bible lived so long and life spans increasingly shorted and even more so after Noah as the genetic material was corrupted by corrosive elements (sun, sugar, heat, malnutrition ect) and inbreeding (there were not that many people on the ark).|`|A4vc2Dg9aa	Please don't tell me that you believe the Adam & Eve story literally!    It is an obvious allegory used by the church to explain why humans must suffer and work for a living, and seek redemption for some imaginary "original sin" - through obeying the church of course.    Organized religion is nothing more than a tool used to manipulate people and to command obedience. It has little to do with real Spirituality and everything to do with secular power and control.     The Bible is one of its chief tools and is comprised of a little actual history, and much made-up propaganda. The Bible as we know it today was written sometime around 400AD by the founders of the Roman Catholic Church. It was later modified (many times) by Popes and Kings and Protestant fanatics, all of whom had their own agendas for doing so.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Because sexism and male chauvinism exist in heaven as they do on earth.

Get over it you guys, and make some legislation that will pass.|`|6lHbIl2waa	Yep, but in my dreams she says that after some hot monkey lovin and we read the bible together.|`|RkysBrVwaa	I don't care if people want to cry hate or bigots- that is their freedom of speech. Just like voting yes was ours. What I do care about is this notion that the LDS church is the one to "blame". If you are going to cry hate- then it needs to include all 5 million+ people that voted for it- not single out one group, to try and make them an example or give someone to blame...    Here are some facts...    -The actual church didn't donate any funds- they endorsed the prop and encouraged members to participate in any way they could- along with 233+ other churches    - The actual members of the church only account for less than 25% of the yes on 8 money donated to the prop (please refer to the LA Times link- you can track the money from that website)    - Over 5 million people voted for the prop. there are only 750,000 LDS members in california. If EVERY single person EVER baptized (because membership records is not based on activity) including children voted yes- that would make up for less than 15% of the votes that voted yes.    - The church had NO hand in any campaign tactics, ads etc. all of it was ran by the National Organization for Marriage which has absolutley NO affiliation with the church whatsoever.    - the No on 8 side actually ended up raising more money. With more donations from out of state than the yes side.    http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-mon...    - the polls show that 70% of african americans, and a little over 50% of latinos, regardless of party affiliation voted yes on the prop. Latino's make up for more than 40% of the states population. and african americans about 10%. (there were no statistics on caucasian or asian voters)    -- similar bans also passed in florida which has less than 1% mormons but the prop passed 62%.    -arkansas previously passed a ban on marriage and on civil unions at 70% and the mormon population there doesn't even make up a percentage of the population.    -Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Ohio, Utah and Oregon all passed bans in 2004 with more than 70% votes. but with the exception of Utah all of those states have less than 5% mormons in their state.    - the prop had to pass through legislation before even being on the ballot. It's not like church had any hand in that...it's not like the prop was their idea. It actually was put on by the Knights of Columbus which is backed by the Catholic church.    - 160+ organizations endorsed the prop and 60+ public officials.    Now I recognize that the church members had a big influence with those that donated time and efforts. But can you honestly say it was all the mormons? Or even the LDS church at all? Could it be that people are just looking for someone to blame?|`|7y5fLEL4aa	I once had a dream that a religious fanatic bludgeoned my feet for saying that I believed all the Gods are false - that a God can only exist if it is not chained by our inferior human knowledge, and the ridiculous rules we throw upon it.

There are probably only 250,000 voting Mormons in California.  Hardly enough to pass an amendment on their own.     You got out voted.....quit your whining.  It wasn't the Mormons, it was California. |`|RqC1s733aa	Shut up.    If you're going to put bigoted statements up like this, I fully expect to see a questions just like it dedicated to the Catholics, Evangelicals, etc. as well.

dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Mormons churn out more than their fair share of hypocrites. I lived in Utah for a good portion of my life and I knew many gay people. Mormons treat homosexuality like they treat most things.... if you disapprove of it, just pretend that it does not exist. That is why there are so many gay men married to nice ladies in Utah. Marriages that will eventually end in  divorce and humiliate the wives, children, and family members on all sides... To Mormons homosexuality is something that can be changed or something that is caused because someone was not breastfed or because they played with a doll when they were in their crib.    Prop 8 was disappointing, but at the same time the victory was not a landslide... I think it was like 53% to 47%... it is inevitable that same-sex marriages will become a legal and a socially acceptable union... but it looks to me like we still may be 10-20 years from it.|`|65QqZBnjaa	The church should be stripped of it's tax exempt status if you ask me.  Churches should not be involved directly in politics like they OBVIOUSLY were this time.|`|izY3JNhqaa	it's not only the Mormons but a whole bunch of people who are against the teachings of Jesus Christ where he says NOT to Judge Yest LE Be Judged.  People with nothing better to do just have to make OTHER people's lives miserable as well.    It's OK.  There's a new Proposition coming up that will ban divorce since it is a mockery of the sanctity of marriage.  Since the Catholic Church does NOT allow divorce, the state should not since that goes against religion.  It's a valid argument too.  A group of people figured that if people want to deny gay marriage to preserve sanctity that it's only fair to ban divorce since that preserves sanctity as well.  Won't it be funny when ALL of these people who got divorces find that their divorce has been annulled and they are STILL married to the love of their teenage life!  Bliss indeed.

Is that really a puzzling issue to you?  2.  The LDS church has not had any polygamists within its membership for 110 years.  Read the papers much pal?  Have you also heard yet that Kennedy was assassinated?  3.  Why is it the job of Latter-Day Saints to stomp out polygamy?  The LDS church opposes it already and doesn't allow ANY polygamists to be members of their church.  What more do you want?        Let me guess...you also find it odd that a large number of blacks in America voted for Obama.  Right?

That practice is already illegal and prosecuted in those states.  There's nothing to do.      That said, polygamy isn't an easy crime to persecute.  How is it that someone in Colorado City is a polygamist but Hugh Hefner is not?  What about the guy that is married and gets a second girl pregnant?  Is he too a polygamist?      Utah is probably the state that it is toughest on polygamy.  The leader of the FLDS church is currently in a Utah prison.

Or that it is better to mourn than to rejoice? Yet the Bible says so, at Ecclesiastes 7:1-4. Understanding comes when the historical background of the words is known. A name is better than good oil, and the day of death than the day of ones being born. Better is it to go to the house of mourning than to go to the banquet house, because that is the end of all mankind; and the one alive should take [it] to his heart. Better is vexation than laughter, for by the crossness of the face the heart becomes better. The heart of the wise ones is in the house of mourning, but the heart of the stupid ones is in the house of rejoicing. Just as a good name with God is better than precious oil or any other material possession, so death after a life that has built up a good name with God is better than birth when one has no name with God at all and it is unknown whether the name one builds during life will be good or bad. Death with a good name insures that one of a resurrection to life, but at birth one has no assurance at all of attaining the new world of everlasting life. And when it speaks of the house of mourning it refers to a home in which a person has died, and the practice of friends going there to comfort the survivors. It is better to show this kindness than to callously ignore those in grief and rush off to banquets to laugh and revel and rejoice. Ordinarily it is better to begin life than end it, and to rejoice than to mourn; but when we understand what is behind these words we see that they are exceptional, that in their setting they are true.|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	If the mother dies, the baby dies.

The husband got extremely angry and told the doctor "NO you will try to save the MOTHER. We have four other children at home who NEED her, do you understand me?!" So the doctor didn't like it but agreed to save the mother instead of the baby. In the end, both the mother and baby were saved. The baby is now 40 years old, his mother is in her late 60s.

There's a possibility that there might be Jinns out there who worship Idols and there are Jinns for sure who follow their fellow Jinn, Iblees (Satan), such idolator & followers of Satan Jinns are sheer Unbelievers as per Koran, similar to the way there is men who worship idols, other men of the mankind and the likewise.    {{ Take it or leave it, your choice :))    }}|`|mggll8dRaa	We Would Fight Them over Religeous Beliefs, More Than Likely;    Same Old, Same Old.......!!|`|12404275a6e62a47f2d36bd0fb0e6886aa	I don't think that it would.

" We always new he was a cute, friendly creature, but E.T. also would be our brother in Christ, the Jesuit director of the Vatican Observatory told the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano last week.     In an interview, "The extraterrestrial is my brother," Father Jose Gabriel Funes said that it's OK to believe in both alien life and God, The Chicago Tribune reports. Extraterrestrial creatures would still be God's creatures. And ruling out their existence would "set limits on the creative liberty of God."    "How can we rule out that life may have developed elsewhere?" Funes said. "Just as we consider earthly creatures as 'a brother,' and 'sister,' why should we not talk about an 'extraterrestrial brother'? It would still be part of creation."    In most of the interview, Funes argued that science and religion are compatible, but most reaction to the interview has obviously been about his comments on aliens.     According to a follow-up article in The Chicago Tribune, the church has discussed the possibility of extraterrestrial life since the Middle Ages. What's more interesting are the theological questions that come from such a thought: "whether God could have created more than one world and whether other beings could be granted redemption via a Christ-like savior."    More fundamentalist churches would have greater difficulty with the idea that intelligent life from another planet was created in God's image. "Any kind of literalist in Christianity would be barring these sorts of beliefs," said Thomas O'Brien, a professor of religious studies at DePaul University. "If you were to go to some fundamentalist Christian churches, you'd hear some pastors say belief in UFOs is tantamount to a non-belief in Jesus Christ."    One commenter on The Seeker blog said that if aliens abduct and probe you, they must come from the devil, but certainly humans abduct and do a lot worse than just probe each other, and we still say that all humans are God's creatures.     Do aliens exist or not? But more importantly what does that mean about God?    I personally like the quote from Father Thomas O'Meara, a visiting theology professor at Boston College, in the second Tribune article: "If you have a mature view of God, God can do what God wants."

In addition to teaching, children can learn by example and role modeling. Loving God is another question. It's a form of brain washing when children don't understand what they are being taught. If they become believers at a very young aga, they will be like robots believing yet not understanding. Children can learn about religion on their own when they are able to reason.

KAKXZw0Qaa	There are some things that I do agree with the Jehovah Witness's about .  I have always appreciated their definition of Sin and that is "To Make A Mistake ". You could say by this Definition that Adam insisted on using his own judgment -which was not all seeing so to speak and self serving with out the over all Love consideration and insight from God.  Many times mistakes can be corrected and sometimes they can not.  Like crossing a red light in traffic - may be a mistake with dire consequences.  The ultimate Mistake is misleading people about who The God Of Love and Creation truly is for self serving manipulative purposes .  Jesus said this time and again to the church's of his day. He even called them vipers.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Neither would make any sense because both you and Adam are two independent persons, so sins cannot be imputed from one person to the other. The sins would be totally unrelated.|`|9MhdJ1YDaa	No. Both are illogical per the explanation of the nature of sin the Bible.     Ezekiel 18:20 The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not bear the guilt of the father, nor the father bear the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.|`|AA10945101	I think I'd argue the opposite.  If sin works the way I think it works, then your sins can absolutely be attributed to Adam...his sins and the sins of every human that came after him shaped the world you live in...and at least some of the consequences live on to this day in the human psyche!  On the other hand, attributing his sins to you makes somewhat less sense...takes a little more of a stretch to think of a way that your sins could somehow be the cause of Adam's sins...perhaps if the consequences of sin travel both directions along the time line...but that's a little harder to swallow than the suggestion that we are all a product of the sins of our ancestors!
iVv6bFW2aa	In the first place evil needs to be defined, because what's evil to one may not be to another.Believers would say that because God gave people free will, and the devil is always around, everyone has the potential for evil, unless they resist the temptations of Satan. I don't accept this, however. Jean Jacques Rousseau said that men are born good, but can become evil or bad as a result of socialization. For example a child abuser, often has been abused himself as a child and therefore has had negative negative role models. I prefer to use some other term besides evil, such as aberrant behaviour, or emotional disturbance  which can also be causative of . the  evil in, us Many off us may lose our tempers and behave in hurtful ways.Often this  type may require, therapy , counseling,or rehabilitative incarceration.

The definition of evil is so vague that almost anything can be deemed evil:    I was watching Most Evil. One episode was about a man who's entire family was murdered. He tracked down the killers and killed them. He was in jail a long time and released later on. He doesn't regret what he did - is he evil? Would he have ever committed this horrible act had he not been so provoked?

93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	Congratulations, you have found one of the many passages in the scriptures that needs further explanation.  Let me share what I understand of this term.  God is often known by multiple names or titles.  He says that Endless is His name and Eternal is His name.  Thus, Endless punishment or Eternal punishment is really saying God's punishment.  Likewise Eternal reward would mean God's reward.  So what we are really talking about is that punishment that is just in God's sight or according to His justice.  Thus, every person will receive what they deserve, be it punishment or reward according to the justice of God.  Endless punishment does not mean without end.  It does not mean forever.  It only means that punishment that God has delivered to any given person, for Endless is His name.  D&C 19: 10, 12    10 For, behold, the mystery of godliness, how great is it! For, behold, I am endless, and the punishment which is given from my hand is endless punishment, for Endless is my name.

Fact is, it is utterly purposeless. Unless God is a sadist. |`|p24zxHfSaa	So you do not believe God then?|`|skMQE2vsaa	I assume you are speaking of "Hell."  Despite what mainstream Christians believe, Hell isn't a literal lake of fire with eternal torment...Hell is just the grave and, upon Jehovah's return, He will resurrect all those that put their faith in Jesus Christ.  Those that didnt believe will just stay in the grave.  So, in short, there is no endless punishment.|`|jj6rqeETaa	Sho'nuff, April...

He is holy, perfect, good, merciful, that is why men have any hope at all of salvation, because God in love shows love toward sinners in crushing His own Son, that we might have peace with God.     He did not spare His own Son from His wrath, do you expect He will be partial to you?

Assuming of course I understand your charge of God sending people to hell.  Fisrt and foremost God must be true to Himself and for His own good purpose of which we cannot understand.    Romans 9  14What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! 15For he says to Moses,     "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,        and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."[f] 16It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy. 17For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: "I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."[g] 18Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.  19One of you will say to me: "Then why does God still blame us? For who resists his will?" 20But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? "Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, 'Why did you make me like this?' "[h] 21Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?   22What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrathprepared for destruction? 23What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory.  |`|e6641d6cbdf235bfa57234225bb86755aa	I assume that you're talking about Hell. So No... It would not help to rehabilitate a mistaken human being. Of course, "forever" is not a very clear word in the believer's vocabulary.

So  your answer is yes.      Eric  S|`|YmyyCLM2aa	After having to run laps in my boxers as a replacement for health class, punishment for boys, no.|`|ykImIiTwaa	No it wouldn't! But actually...    God eventually saves all of us from sin and punishment and shares His complete happy experience of eternity with everyone...      God reconciles all to Himself through Jesus Christ, Who makes peace through His shed blood and crucifixion (Col 1:20). Jesus is the Lamb of God Who takes away all the sins of all the world (Jn 1:29). The creation itself, also, shall be freed from the slavery of corruption into the glorious freedom of the children of God (Rom 8:21).    Hell's punishment is not forever but until the end of the eons - eonian punishment. People don't sin enough during their mortal lives for God to choose endless punishment besides it would spoil the future of eternity to have a section continually reserved for endless torture...    People are made by God to rebel against His ideal will for them and then offered a choice - forgiveness of their rebellion, or, punishment for their sins until they have paid the last 'penny'... After punishment, those who went through torture in hell come to realise they need faith on God to succeed in life and they are converted into God's kingdom so that they cease from sinning and are rewarded for their compliance...

I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town  Now I don't believe the Sodom and Gomorrah crowd will be up for rewards, so it would seem there are indeed varying degrees of punishment.

I will be their God,        and they will be my people.   11No longer will a man teach his neighbor,        or a man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,'     because they will all know me,        from the least of them to the greatest.   12For I will forgive their wickedness        and will remember their sins no more."[c]      You will not be forgiven for rejecting Christ.

If you commit as many as a hundred sins, they all go into the first eternity of punishment. Basically 10 sins is the same as 1 sin.     And according to Martin Luther (NOT MARTIN LUTHER KING, OR JUNIOR.), if you forgive yourself, and if you apologize, if you are truly sorry of what you have done, never do it again, and apologize to yourself and God, you will be cleared of your sins. Also, if you have faith.

C8gLsP3Taa	Heaven will be with no Sin.  It is a place that God has prepared for all who come to Him. If the Creator of the Universe prepared it, it must be something wonderful. The writers of the Scriptures could not find language that would describe it. In Revelation 21:10-27, John tries to describe the foundations, wall, gates and street of the heavenly city. We know that there will be no sickness, sorrow, tears, pain or death in that fair place. Revelation 21:4. What we do know is that after the sorrow and suffering from the pains of life on this sin cursed earth, we will be finally home. But best of all, the Lord Jesus Christ will be there, and He will be the supreme delight of every believer's heart.  |`|ATPPWOpWaa	Yes.  Satan was found to be with sin while in Heaven.      Ezekial 28   " 'You(satan) were the model of perfection,         full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.  13 You were in Eden,         the garden of God;         every precious stone adorned you:         ruby, topaz and emerald,         chrysolite, onyx and jasper,         sapphire, [b] turquoise and beryl. [c]         Your settings and mountings [d] were made of gold;         on the day you were created they were prepared.  14 You were anointed as a guardian cherub,         for so I ordained you.         You were on the holy mount of God;         you walked among the fiery stones.   15 You were blameless in your ways         from the day you were created         till wickedness was found in you.  16 Through your widespread trade         you were filled with violence,         and you sinned.         So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God,         and I expelled you, O guardian cherub,         from among the fiery stones.  17 Your heart became proud         on account of your beauty,         and you corrupted your wisdom         because of your splendor.         So I threw you to the earth;         I made a spectacle of you before kings.

C8gLsP3Taa	The Church must be viewed from two perspectives. The church is not a physical body but a spiritual body. There is the local church, which is a physical expression of the Body of Christ where a group of Christians meet in a physical location. It may be a house, a particular building designated for meeting, a cave or whatever. The people are the church, not the physical structure. This is a local assembly of believers who have received His Word, been born again and are baptized. They come together for studying doctrine, prayer, breaking of bread and fellowship. Acts 2:41-42.     Second, there is the "Church" which is universal and is made up of all born again believers on planet earth along with those who are in Heaven. If you are saved today, you are a member of this Church. Some have called it the "Invisible Church."    So to be part of the TRUE CHURCH one needs to have their names in the Lambs book of life and unless you got that your not saved and do not belong to the true church.|`|c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	1 Corinthians 12:13 says, "For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit. For the body is not one member, but many." We see that anyone who believes is part of the body of Christ. The true church of God is not any particular church building or denomination. The universal church of God is all those who have received salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.  |`|AA10034051	ONE CHURCH - Is there to be only one Church or many? According to Scripture, Christ wanted us to be one (John 17:22-23). We are all as a Church to be of one mind and to think the same (Philippians 2:2; Romans 15:5). There is only to be one "faith" (Ephesians 4:3-6), not many. For the Church is Christ's Body and Christ only had one Body, not many. Also, since the Church is Christ's Bride (Ephesians 5:29), can Christ be married to more than one wife (essentially a spiritual form of the the sin of polygamy)? No, Christ can only have one wife (i.e., one Church, not many).      Every Christian believes that Jesus Christ established and sustains a community of faith, hope and love for all believers. This community we call His Church. The Church that Christ founded is the Catholic Church in 33AD which has a formal earthly structure established by Christ and which continues under His authority and protection.     Jesus did three things that established the framework of His Church. First, He chose humans to carry out His work. He appointed Peter to be the visible head of the Church. Jesus said to Peter, "You are Rock and on this rock I will build my Church." (Matthew 16: 18) Jesus said "build," as in to create a structure. Jesus built His structure on specifically chosen human beings Peter and the apostles.     Second, Jesus gave Peter and the apostles the power and authority to carry out His work. "Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven."(Matthew 16:19; 18:18) "Receive the Holy Spirit, whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven, whose sins you retain, they are retained."(John 20:23)     Third, Jesus gave Peter and the apostles commands as to what that work should be. At the last supper, He commanded, "Do this in memory of Me." (Luke 22:19) He commanded them to "Make disciples of all nations" (Matthew 28:19), and to "Go into the whole world and proclaim the Gospel to every creature." (Mark 16:15)         The Catholic Church is the only church that can claim to have been founded by Christ personally. Every other church traces its lineage back to a mere human person such as Martin Luther or John Wesley. The Catholic Church can trace its lineage back to Jesus Christ who appointed St. Peter as the first pope. This line of popes has continued unbroken for almost 2,000 years.     God rules, instructs and sanctifies His people through His Church. Under her teaching office, the Catholic Church preserves the Word of God. She is the custodian, keeper, dispenser and interpreter of teachings of Christ. And she accomplishes this under the protection of the Holy Spirit.      FOUR MARKS OF THE TRUE CHURCH         If we wish to locate the Church founded by Jesus, we need to locate the one that has the four chief marks or qualities of his Church. The Church we seek must be one, holy, catholic, and apostolic.     The Church Is One (Rom. 12:5, 1 Cor. 10:17, 12:13, CCC 813822)   Jesus established only one Church, not a collection of differing churches (Lutheran, Baptist, Anglican, and so on). The Bible says the Church is the bride of Christ (Eph. 5:2332). Jesus can have but one spouse, and his spouse is the Catholic Church.    His Church also teaches just one set of doctrines, which must be the same as those taught by the apostles (Jude 3). This is the unity of belief to which Scripture calls us (Phil. 1:27, 2:2).     Although some Catholics dissent from officially-taught doctrines, the Churchs official teachersthe pope and the bishops united with himhave never changed any doctrine. Over the centuries, as doctrines are examined more fully, the Church comes to understand them more deeply (John 16:1213), but it never understands them to mean the opposite of what they once meant.     The Church Is Holy (Eph. 5:2527, Rev. 19:78, CCC 823829)   By his grace Jesus makes the Church holy, just as he is holy. This doesnt mean that each member is always holy. Jesus said there would be both good and bad members in the Church (John 6:70), and not all the members would go to heaven (Matt. 7:2123).     But the Church itself is holy because it is the source of holiness and is the guardian of the special means of grace Jesus established, the sacraments (cf. Eph. 5:26).    The Church Is Catholic (Matt. 28:1920, Rev. 5:910, CCC 830856)   Jesus Church is called catholic ("universal" in Greek) because it is his gift to all people. He told his apostles to go throughout the world and make disciples of "all nations" (Matt. 28:1920).     For 2,000 years the Catholic Church has carried out this mission, preaching the good news that Christ died for all men and that he wants all of us to be members of his universal family (Gal. 3:28).      Over 33,000 Sects "Scattered" Outside The One Church Founded By Christ          There Was Only ONE Church Founded By Christ    AND HIS CHURCH STILL LIVES TODAY!!    Catholic Christian  |`|B5Y46XBoaa	JESUS CHRIST IS THE CORNERSTONE OF THE CHURCH -   (The way, the truth, and the life)    Psalm 118:22 - The stone [which] the builders refused is become the head [stone] of the corner.    Mat 21:42 - Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?    WE THE BELIEVERS ARE THE BODY OF THE CHURCH -    Rom 12: (4) - For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: (5) So we, [being] many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.    1Cr 10:17 - For we [being] many are one bread, [and] one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.    1Cr 12: (13) - For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether [we be] Jews or Gentiles, whether [we be] bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. (14) - For the body is not one member, but many.

It is the only right one and there is only one true God.  Scripture says so, and so does Chuck Norris.  But not Arnold Schwarzzeneger.

Because they cannot count.|`|533z6lWpaa	The True Church is not a building. It is a group of Christians (those that Jesus; honest, good, yet flawed Christians). It is a body of believers, acting as Jesus to this modern world. Basically, we as the Church are supposed to be reaching out to, loving unconditionally, giving to, helping, and comforting others. It doesn't always turn out that way, though. If only we could mimic Jesus!|`|HqsiNMf2aa	Almost all churches have some part of the truth, but only one church can have the whole and complete truth. That church will be the one God has established on earth, will have His authority (priesthood), and will exist in the same form as established at the time of Christ. That organization was lost soon after His ascension and the apostles death.    The only one that can answer that question for you is God Himself. Many will tell you it is their church that is the right one (myself included). Some may tell you that none are right and as long as we believe, we will be saved (which is almost right).    James 1:5    Seek the answer yourself. Study the doctrines and learn of the practices from active members of the different churches. Then, get on your knees and pray to God for guidance. He will tell you in your heart if it is His true and complete church.    I have followed this process and found that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the true church established by the hand of God on earth. This is my answer, though. I can't expect anyone to be converted based on my experience. I can, however,  encourage you to find out for yourself, and I know the Holy Ghost will answer those who truly want to know.|`|Tg5H2uSVaa	"ALL" the people that believe in Christ Jesus.

iVv6bFW2aa	I am not sure about this. If God doesn't exist, then he didn't create us or anything else. If he does then maybe he is playing games or  he wants to test people as to whether they would sin. I would say that he gave us free will, precisely for the question that you ask.|`|26cb6190c99a848bb4c18aed374707c0aa	When we have the Holy Spirit we are convicted all the time.    |`|NlnM6diMaa	Umm   maybe he's a sadist.|`|8fSP4Iyjaa	even atheists would disagree to that|`|XHHMWHCJaa	god didn't created us with the propensity because he want us to be obideant to him and choose him to be  our lord.
kXYqzi48aa	 In my opinion : Be Sure. God always want to save us. So he send jesus and make the task he want from him. Jesus is just a messanger of god to spread out the facts. He is back again and again in the different firm and country but. Neighter we recognise him nor he knows himself. The creation who take birth in earth is certainly die a day sooner or later. Who take birth is not the god only the good spirit and soul work as per the inner directions from super invisible power. Such soul work for other people who want to live. Jesus himself does not wanted to live more In the world so he fight and die for good but not die from the soul of everypeople in the world. He alive forever. |`|mpGgXoGoaa	Yes.     What kind of God is that who needs a blood sacrifice when he can just forgive humans for their sins?    What kind of faith is that that believes that God needs a human sacrifice to forgive sins?    What kind of people would believe that God allowed his "son" to be savagely tortured, killed and humiliated while he was just watching all of it for the salvation of mankind that he can just do anytime?    What kind of love it is that, that  would require a blood sacrifice of an innocent person for the salvation of the sinners when God can just forgive them?    What kind of a "father" is god who was willing to see his "son" being tortured and killed by people and in the end was even taunted by the "son" for forsaking him?    What kind of power God has that he can not save his won "son" while he was able to saved the Jews from the oppression of the Pharaoh and even forgive their sins?    What love, mercy and compassion are we talking about when the victim of the human sacrifice was not even a willing victim? He was crying, praying to God and in the end blamed God for forsaking him?    What kind of people celebrate and take the symbol of the human sacrifice as sacred when their Lord suffered, was humiliated and tortured on that same symbol?    What kind of people can shamelessly shout to the world that god needed an innocent blood to redeem mankind from sins? How savage that could be?      But I guess there are millions of them...and you know what is ironic these same people are accusing the Muslims of having a savage god!!!|`|ht07LcFnaa	All divine interaction with humanity has involved a spiritual "dumbing down" by the deity.  Since we as lowly humans have limited understanding of spiritual matters, the god used Christ's suffering to illustrate the great deal of pain the deity undergoes as a result of true sin.  Being the underlying fabric of all reality, the deity suffers when its creations do harm to itself.  Thus, the suffering of Christ represents a substitution for god's pain by making it incarnate in the human Jesus.|`|xo4iux9gaa	No.    The righteous requiremnt of the law had to be fulfilled....and only Jesus could do it.    And someone had to pay the price for sin.  A 'spotless" lamb was required.|`|mggll8dRaa	It Sure Seems That Way....!!|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	Nope.  God is justice, and he had the greatest of ideas to subject an innocent man to death.  Now being just he could judge sin and death as the guilty one taking something it had no right to take, and could raise those in Christ to life without anyone accusing him of wrong.    Brilliant!|`|G4SwEHP5aa	No...    Here is an illustration:  A man is convicted as a murderer and sentenced to death.  Now, he is at the mercy of the judge, who judged him.  The judge cannot go back on his word and the law.  Thus, he says, "You are guilty of the crime you must pay.  Since you are my son whom I love, I will die in your place."|`|SsSIbFhcaa	He did not sacrifice Jesus.    Jesus gave his life in payment of all our sins, it is an act of Self Sacrifice. Like throwing yourself on a hand grenade to save your friends only with more ramifications.    From the moment of man's sin a price had to be paid to bring us back into line with God. The price is your life; since you had to die to pay it you could never be right with God before you died.    God chose to take the form of Man and pay the price of death for us thus we do not have to die in order to be saved. Jesus was raised from the dead to prove he had conquered death and that we could have life through him.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, definitely, so he either was a sadist, lazy, or he was testing Jesus's loyalty.|`|AAAw24KOaa	Seems sort of arbitrary doesn't it?|`|AA11420751	Yes, since he did create everything  he would be able do anything.|`|Xsg9JDx1aa	Ok, I'm not even really Christian any more, but here's something that makes way more sense if you believe in an omnipotent God:    Yes, God could have just gone "poof, no more sin and death!", but we as humans would never be able to get that message. He needed to send someone to show us the truth, save us from ourselves, whatever. We all know from watching pretty much every movie ever that a person who makes the "ultimate sacrifice" is way more awesome/makes for a better story/people will actually remember. Humans thrive on theatrics, that's why the Jesus story has captured the attention of so many.|`|15aab0a27a4ed405f2ef954104c5fd65aa	WOW, some of these answers scare me.      People actually rationalize this stuff.|`|7Arh80GIaa	There is a legal precedent being set that will stand forever.  Satan accused God of being an unjust sovereign over men and angels. God could have wiped everyone out and start again but that would have proved He was powerful but not much else. Satan lied to trick Eve into disobeying Gods direct command to not eat something that was not hers. God had the right to set laws and boundaries. Satan disagreed. Jesus stepped up to answer the false accusation by living an equal life to what Adam had lost as a perfect man and did remain faithful, even under harsh test.  Because Jesus died faithful, he proved that created man was capable of living by Gods standards. Satan was proved a liar. Legal precedent stands forever.|`|AA10014750	No. Being all poweful only indicates the power one has. Giving his Son, showed how much he wanted it. (Giving one's child, can cost a parent more than giving one's own life).|`|wPnScOlsaa	In response to some of the poor illustrations like Traveler's, it does not necessarily work that way. God's will is not bound by any rule book, and we cannot make him conform to our standards of what justice is.   God has forgiven the sins of many people in the past without requiring any type of sacrifice. He even has forgiven people even when they didn't ask for it. After committing the sin of adultery, King David fasted and offered sacrifices to God, yet God chose not to forgive. It is silly to make a claim that God is coerced into doing our bidding because we spill blood or recite an incantation. It is even worse when we make a claim that God must abide by our laws as if he were some sort of computer program.    Examine:    Psalm 40:6 Sacrifice and meal offering You have not desired; my ears You have opened; Burnt offerings and sin offerings You have not required    Psalm 78:36 Their heart was not steadfast toward Him, nor were they faithful in His covenant. But He, being compassionate, forgave their iniquity...remembering that they were but flesh.    Isaiah 43:23 You have not brought Me the sheep of your burnt offerings...or the fat of your sacrifices, but you have burdened Me with your sins...Nevertheless, I will wipe out your transgressions for My own sake, and I will not remember your sins.    Jeremiah 36:3 That every man will turn from his evil way, then I will forgive their iniquity and their sin.    Isaiah 55:7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return to the L-rd, and He will have compassion on him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon    Hosea 14:1 Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God, For you have stumbled because of your iniquity. Take words with you and return to the L-rd. Say to Him, `Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously, for we will render as bullocks the offerings of our lips'.    Daniel 4:27 Therefore, O king, may my advice be pleasing to you: Redeem your sins by doing righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor.    So YES, God could forgive us (and has forgiven us) for the sins that we committed without the use of sacrifices. They are not required.   God even says this about sacrifices: Has the Lord as great a delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken more than the fat of rams. Samuel 15:22 and This: To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to the L-rd than sacrifice." Proverbs 21:3    People took one quote from the bible that talks about eating blood (Leviticus 17:11) and twisted it to mean that forgiveness is only obtained through sacrifices.    King Solomon summed it up nicely when talking about forgiveness.   "If they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who have taken them captive, and pray to You toward their land which You have given to their fathers, the city which You have chosen, and the house which I have built for Your name; then hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven Your dwelling place, and maintain their cause, and forgive Your people who have sinned against You and all their transgressions which they have transgressed against You..." (I Kings 8:46-50).         |`|QluBTwCvaa	Jesus Christ/ Yeshua Ha Meshyiach said "for this cause came I into the World."    The Lamb of God was necessary to transfer our sin to the sinless.  It was pictured with an innocent lamb being sacrificed until the innocent "Lamb Of God" was sacrificed.   Jesus was not looking forward to the pain.  He asked Father if there was any other way possible to complete the plan of salvation, to take this cup from Him.  There was no other way.    The pre-incarnate Yeshua knew this before He came.  When Yeshua put aside His glory and became a man, He had to grow in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man.  Then the Father spoke "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased."  Jesus always did the will of the Father.     He died on the cross to let the innocent pay for the guilty.  Greater love has no man that this, that a man lay down His life for (Josephine and) his brother. It is not theatrics; It is legalities.    There are spiritual laws just like there are physical laws.  Sin demands payment.|`|0jFlKAUtaa	Yes but He chose to become fully human through Jesus.

Jesus was there with God at creation, see the Let Us make man in our image section of Genesis.  Later, Jesus came in a human form, with divine power, probably so earthlings wouldn't freak out by seeing all the glory of God.|`|kKLApZCiaa	God is, everywhere at once. Unlike the devil. He is three, but one. =) I know it's hard to understand but. O.K. think of it this way... When someone dies, there body goes in the ground. But there soul goes either to Heaven or Hell.

9c7c4192016169baf847ee7ae4705422aa	There have been additions to this in light of other answers.    If a scientist cloned a human, wouldn't that scientist be its "god"?  If any aspect of religion were even viable, could they have a "soul-link" because the scientist CHOSE to create that human?"  I say no in relation to this because the christian god is purported to be able to make something from nothing.  Even scientists have to admit that they didn't make the items necessary to clone.  With this in mind, why were humans formed from dirt, if god could create from nothing? (Genesis 1:1).    If the cloned being, years in the future, were to do something to the disliking of said scientist, couldn't the scientist arrange for a way for the cloned being to make amends for their misdoing?  Or would a good scientist even care that a 'wrong' has been made?  Like all other scientists and their theories as to life, and trial and error, wouldn't that decision be classified as morally unnecessary, with maybe the possibility of financial necessity, depending on the type of 'wrong' that occurred?    More about the 'dirt' comment: are we to literally accept dirt as the direct object that formed humans, or dust?  The bible does include the scripture "..from dust to dust..".  Would actually I force you to make a decision of either dirt or dust, "Choose you this day if it's dirt or dust"?  No, because, like a good amoeba, I'm merely responding to stimuli.    What about other aspects of bible that even christians have to take on moral reflection only, like when it's lawful to kill someone who commits a religious crime, like saying the wrong thing at the wrong time?  If the preceding argument can be made, couldn't bible-arguers make the same postulation about topics such as death, or even genocide?  Would they want to?    What if 'dirt' were actually a gel-like formation in the water, like an amoeba?  What if a 'day' as classified in genesis, were actually millions of years?  The bible does say that, to god, "..a day is as a thousand years, and [vice-versa]..".  The chances of our solar system being the center of the universe are too high.  Besides, our sun has roughly 50,000 years left on it.  Also, our galaxy will collide with Andromeda in billions of years.|`|r1hkyFmVaa	Yes, but could the scientist?|`|iVv6bFW2aa	I would say yes, because in the last analysis both the scientist and his/her clone was created by God, as is everything  else.I am saying this from the standpoint of the believer, which I am not|`|kXYqzi48aa	In my Opinion and as per i listen : There is some inner power more than the physical body we get.

u4SJHSgUaa	The anger is not a sin.  It is an emotion, just like joy.  It's what you do with the anger that is usually the sin,     James 1:19 My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,  for mans anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.    It is a very real emotion and very dangerous to us and to others around us.  We can ruin our lives being angry and letting it eat us up from the inside.      Proverbs 29:11 A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise man keeps himself under control.       26 In your anger do not sin?a?: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry,  27 and do not give the devil a foothold.  28 He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with his own hands, that he may have something to share with those in need.    Eph 4:29 Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. 30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 31 Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. 32 Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.     Easier said than done, maybe, but remember that all sin was overcome by Christ and we have been given His mercy and grace.  If we mess up and fall again, we ask for forgiveness and start over.  Just having a heart to recognize the sin and ask for forgiveness is a great start.      Know you will get angry and prepare yourself mentally to close your mouth and walk away.  Leave it until you can talk about it without sinning.  |`|Tww6Zbv1aa	  you have to repent and ask god to help you with it no man is without sin so we need to repent |`|wjzAsRhraa	Sin of Anger? LOL!!!

When you feel angry this is your emotional guidance system telling you you do not like the thoughts you are thinking.      Begin to choose thoughts that do not bring up the emotion of anger. Think about a different situation or think about how you would prefer the situation that brings you anger to be.  Shift your thinking and you will shift your emotional state.    Then you can hit that bull's eye of happiness you were aiming at.    Mike    http://mikestrawbridge.com/    |`|veZ0o1RUaa	Ask and He will give.  Pray to him about it first and foremost!

He advised that when one is angry while standing, he should sit down.  If he is sitting, he can stand or lie down. He should control his tongue because he might say something in the fit of anger that he would regret later. He can wash his face or hands (or do ritual washing).    I find it effective to take a bath if I am angry. It cools me down. The prophet (pbuh) said that anger increases the body temperature and thus agitating the person more. We should counter it by washing with water.    The changing of positions can helped in depleting the pressure of anger. It is also effective for me. Especially in those times that you are having those nauseating angers...(hehehehe...joking...i haven't had any though)    Of course washing alone can not solve our anger problem. We need to talk it out with the priest, imam or any person that could help us find the solution.|`|FDsopi1Taa	Anger, per se, is not a sin. The Bible says, "be ye angry and sin not"; thus anger is recognize as a legitimate emotion. It's how we direct and express that emotion that can be sinful. Mind you, it is not sin to express anger; you just have to learn how to express it in a productive way that does not harm others. Cursing and hitting someone are harmful ways of expressing anger. It is not sin to raise your voice, just keep your anger focused on the issue not on the character of the other person.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Anger is not a sin itself, but what you do with it like violence or abuse according to Christians.

From a non religious standpoint anger can also be mobilizing the individual to do something positive.In any case one should control anger, walk away from the situation, and talk it out with the person you are angry at, once everybody has calmed down. In cases of extreme anger and violence one can seek, counseling, psychotherapy, or anger management classes.|`|9btru19waa	Your emotions are your decision, you own them. You decide to be angry or not.

T8GOjLOeaa	A lot less i am guessing!  many aspects of christianity are based on the fear of going to hell and  the hope of going to heaven. but, if there were no heaven the would be no reason to repent your sins, go to church on sunday or any of the other things devoutt christians do. If you know your demise is inevitable what is the point of trying?    great question!    --Cara   |`|yag56mb8aa	They would still blindly believe because of a certain concept called "faith" similar to patriotism isn't it hhhmm.  If, somehow, christianity was to be proven wrong; christians would still have "faith" because that's what faith is: blindly following without ever questioning|`|4ppFDDyqaa	There would be a lot of people. You see, Heaven is a promised  destination for self righteous souls. It's recorded in the Bible and also mentioned by Jesus Christ while hanging on the cross. Whether there is or not a physical place such as heaven or even if Jesus said there was no heaven, I would like to still belong to Christianity as my religion because it contains a lot of guidelines in how to live and conduct our daily lives. No one can go wrong following the 10 Commandments. This will be a peaceful planet if everyone is a believer.|`|hc5H4TKeaa	Well, Christians are followers of Christ.  Christ died on the cross to open the gates of heaven .  So if there is no heaven there is no Jesus Christ.  if you lead a good life and truly believe , you will not see any different.  The ending of life is heaven.  There is a heaven, i.e., God will bestow happiness and the richest gifts on all those who depart this life free from original sin and personal mortal sin, and who are, consequently, in the state of justice and friendship with God.  Thank God there is a heaven. |`|d0l8vdCzaa	me! and my family&friends. |`|Sdme3epjaa	Christians would probly wished they had given into nature rather than fight against it, because they're always trying to fight for what they consider good, and they do it in God's name.  Those that have lived for God and done nothing for themselves, that would be meaningless if they didn't have the ultimate reward for their efforts.  I live for now, I fallow nature, and I enjoy earthly pleasure as well as things that are mentally/emotionally stimulating.  Sin is a dirty word for human/earthly nature, and in that case "Sin" is nothing to be ashamed of.  No heaven, No God, No Devil, No Hell, No Good/Bad.  Just nature and the God/Godess within our selves.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Wait, is there a hell in this scenario?|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Without heaven there would be no Christianity.

Sorry but I had to say it.     Jesus built His plan of redemption, going to the cross and dying and rising from the dead, around faith in Him to get into heaven and to avoid eternal hell.     Without heaven and hell, you'd have to create a fake "jesus", thus nullifying the validity of your question.|`|PGgQAm4Aaa	dude...this question is dumb. If there was no heaven the whole religion would be proven wrong. If there was proof that it was all bs they still wouldnt believe it. Christians((and im talkin the orthodox insane jesus lovers) will never admit they are wrong never they are much to ignorant for that.|`|247e16fe699fb80e444deaffc4762c81aa	then Christ would have died and rose from the dead in vain and the gospel wouldn't be the gospel (good news)    And what Jesus said here would be meaningless      Joh 3:16  For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.     So, why do we desire to believe on Him?  To not perish and to have eternal life.  If He simply said "believe on Me and nothing will change", why would we respond to that?    this whole redemption plan came about because we chose death over life and Jesus came back to remedy that.  When God said "in the day you eat of it you will surely die" that wasn't exactly music to the ears of Adam.    Look at the world today, do you think there's room for improvement?|`|2CBxqNcaaa	the beginning of wisdom is fear of God, not evidence of heaven.|`|xyIZv6iiaa	me.

But to give you an answer, yes.  Because the Way of Christ is born of virtue and is beneficial and expedient.  Is loving and does not seek itself.  Below are lists of virtues and deeds of the flesh.  Its clear where the Way of Christ lies.    Virtues  Charity,chastity, compassion, consideration, courage, courteousness, dependability, diligence, discipline, empathy, endurance, fairness, faith, fidelity, forgiveness, fortitude, generosity, honesty, honour, hopefulness, hospitality, humility,  impartiality, innocence, integrity, joy, kindness, lovingness, loyalty, mercy, moderation, modesty, morality, obedience, patience, peacefulness, perseverance, prudence, purity, purposefulness, respectfulness, restraint, self-discipline, sincerity, sympathy, temperance, thankfulness, trustworthiness, truth, wisdom.    Deeds of the Flesh  Apathy, carelessness, cowardice, corruption, cruelty, dishonesty,  dishonor, disobedience, disrespectfulness, drunkenness, excess, envy, greed, hatred, hostility, indulgence, infidelity, ingratitude, insincerity,  immorality, impatience, impurity, irresponsibility, jealousy, laziness, lust,malice, perversion, pride, procrastination, promiscuity, rudeness, ruthlessness, selfish ambition, selfishness, self gratification, sensuality, slothfulness, strife, unfairness, unfaithful, unkindness, vanity, violence.|`|e52ejkQ7aa	I'm speaking as a Religious Studies major when I answer this question, but I think to people of all religions (not just Christianity) the ultimate reward is not really the point. It is more for the richness that it adds to their experience on the planet. People believe in God/have a spiritual practice because it adds meaning to their lives and brings them inner peace. |`|fB3nEGbhaa	Is it me or is Tedi one sexy lady??    back to the question:    There is no heaven, and they still believe. Pretty crazy thought. |`|d9fb2acd20fb4c3590182dc9f4470d89aa	If there is no Heaven, then Jesus did not come down from Heaven as He plainly stated, and therefore there is no Christ and therefore there is no Christianity.  But there is a Heaven, and there is a Hell, and Jesus did come down from Heaven, He became a man, He died for the sins of the world, he rose again, and ascended into Heaven, and He promises eternal life to all who put their trust in Him.    So ask yourself - what are your options?|`|A1ARpuJbaa	there is though - God knew what he was doing. but I can honestly say I'd still be a child of God because it's about the love of  him too not just the reward. amen|`|oGRsxfBiaa	Personally I would simply want to be with God, wherever that place is :) |`|7CMgVi8iaa	There is no heaven.|`|abb0f6a6801d1a40a3096d11694e5d6caa	me .|`|JTMwNMtraa	lmao |`|eVBASbZ2aa	I most likely would.|`|LfFLpno5aa	You know what, that is a great question, never thought of that before, but id say half of them would be gone|`|nD4vJG1gaa	*drink*    If there was no heaven that would defeat the whole purpose of Christianity, so none.

Heaven is in my future. No doubt what so ever.    I'm sad and unhappy for those that deny God, for the devil exists so God does also.|`|RWUkaXdTaa	Ha, well, if you ever asked a hardcore Christian that question, they wouldn't be able to wrap their mind around it. They would reply with something like "Well, it doesn't really matter, because there is a Heaven". And you couldn't really prove them wrong either, but they can't prove they're right.     I think there would still be part of the population who are just nice, without the help of religion. Yet, there are also those people who only do things because their religion says so. The mindless "I'll believe whatever you say" people are the one's you'd have to worry about. |`|ZghzUDfFaa	I don't understand. What would be the point in following someone who has no authority? What, would he rule Hell? Then no. I would not follow. He promises us heaven, eternal life, for those who follow him. What do we have if theres nothing else? We wouldnt even be able to meet him. What would be the point?    I would still follow him, because he gives guidance on Earth.

I believe that what we think of as hell is something of our own invention so that we can be all self-righteous that what we see as the "bad guys" get their just desserts.  It's nothing to do with concepts of justice.  It's all about vengeance and getting even.  I also believe that it's the way we live which makes for a heaven or a hell right here in this life.  We don't know what's to come after we die.  We don't even know if anything does "come after".

And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.     And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. "  |`|oGRsxfBiaa	I think Hell is simply a place without God because only those who deny God and his gift to us go there, so basically God just grants you your wish and separates you from himself... and since God is hope, Hell is a place with no hope. That's what I believe anyway.    Although seeing that God even gives Satan a second chance, I think he would give others a second chance as well to be with him, but even then many will still deny him because of their pride.    Also only us humans see time as linear, in Heaven and Hell time probably isn't linear so there is no such thing as 'forever' as we may imagine it.|`|lUFBlZ6haa	i suspect she won't know.|`|AA11402921	Your lucky that boy didn't ask Jesus to forgive a certain terrorist though i feel scared cause now i wont just be going to never-world but maybe i didn't really mean it good enough.

C8gLsP3Taa	God does not want anyone to perish but wants everyone to come to tghe Saving Grace which is in Jesus Christ.     "The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance" (II Peter 3:9). The LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, the LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth (Ex. 34:6). See also Numbers 14:18.     How many of us praise the Lord that the Saviour gave us "time" in trusting Him for our salvation? Oh, the long-suffering of God which is manifested toward us, in that we were able to hear the Gospel twice, when there are millions who have never heard it once!     Why does not God strike today? Why are men allowed to blaspheme the God of heaven and His Son Jesus Christ? The answer is found in the patience of God.    |`|iVv6bFW2aa	For a number of possible reasons. God maybe waiting for more persons to accept him, or giving them a chance, He may be playing a game and/or testing people, God's time frame is much longer than that of earthly mortals, or he may be waiting for the time that Jesus will supposedly return to earth. Or he may  be unhappy with humanity and is waiting for a better time to come|`|XHW5aDGraa	You can waste your life waiting for him.

He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance. |`|5q4HIaQZaa	he wants as many as possible to be saved|`|E9chZY74aa	It says because He is longsuffering and wants no one to suffer.|`|b170d0becb56146cf665addf49ca5b4baa	1.

Whereas fundamentalist Christians threaten Hell-fire if one does not repent and believe in the Gospel (according to their particular interpretation of repentance and the Gospel), the strong atheist suggests that you are irrational and less evolved if you do not subscribe to the central point of the atheist creed: "gods (or God) do not exist."  I also think of Communist countries where atheism was the official state policy.

However if a person is terminally ill it's not a good idea to say you will be fine as good as new.

C8gLsP3Taa	God speaks in Psalm 53:1, "The FOOL hath said in his heart, there is no God."  "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction."  (Proverbs 1:7).      Things do not get better and better through natural selection; but, rather deteriorate when left to themselves.  This is proven through Science, itself, by the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  The First Law of Thermodynamics deals with heat transfer, the Third Law relates to the behavior of chemical substances at low temperatures.  The Second Law deals with Entropy (heat loss) and establishes this truth, that things left to themselves will certainly not develop into a higher state of complexity; but will tend to decay and degenerate into more randomness.    Fred Kohler, an ardent evolutionist, is honest enough to admit that evolution has hit a dead end street.  Mr. Kohler says: "One of the most fundamental maxims of the physical sciences is the trend toward greater randomness the fact that, on the average, things will get into disorder rather than into order if left to themselves.  This is essentially the statement that is embodied in the Second Law of Thermodynamics."  (Evolution and Human Destiny, pp. 14-15).  Therefore, the evolutionist does not even believe his own established scientific laws and he wants me to believe his philosophy instead of God!  God knows them well and describes them as such, A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.  (James 1:5).    What would happen to a crop of corn, oats, rye, wheat, or soy beans if left to itself, with God not sending the rain and the farmer not cultivating, fertilizing or controlling the weeds?  The crop wouldnt amount to anything.    Why do grape growers have to prune their vineyards?   If they didnt, it wouldnt be long before the vines would be producing tiny grapes of no worth.    Some time back, I was witnessing to a college professor who was an evolutionist.  I asked him if he was familiar with the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  He acknowledged that he was.  I asked him to tell me how his daughter would turn out if he shut her in her room, never allowed her to play with other children, never sent her to school, and never talked with her.  What would be the result in ten years?  His answer was "A jibbering idiot."  I said to him, if evolution were true, since she would inherit the genes of her father, a college professor, and her mother, a high school teacher, she should evolve into a super-genius as a young lady without any help from anyone.  I shall never forget what he told me.  His words were, "How can a man of my education be so intelligent, and yet void of any common sense and so foolish?"    Further, if we evolved from animals to man, why did we not inherit a sense of smell equal to that of a bear, fox, or wolf?  Why didnt we inherit the eyesight of an eagle?  When certain reptiles lose their tails through predatory attack, they can grow new ones.  Why did not man inherit such a characteristic that he might grow a new finger, arm, or leg should one be severed?  No, evolution is based, upon belief in the reality of the unseen; belief in the fossils that cannot be produced; belief in the embryological evidence that does not exist; and belief in breeding experiments that refuse to come off.    God speaks in Psalm 53:1, "The FOOL hath said in his heart, there is no God."  "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction."  (Proverbs 1:7).  |`|9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	it is the people who need not toil to earn bread only indulge in those useless discussions.instead they should behave like good people.|`|c8828614b563cd3de41253b6a9e40991aa	No. I find any waste of time to be irritating, unnecessary and...well, a waste of time.

We have a responsibility to find out what God wants from us.    If evolution is true, and we literally came from nothing, then life has no meaning and no purpose, we are nothing more than rutting animals fighting for survival, and there's no point doing anything other than following our feelings and desires and getting all we can while we live.

When I hear people slamming intelligent design without any data, I am horrified.    All I can think is that within the last hundred years, evolution has become the belief that feels smart, something everyone "knows" is true, without even knowing why they believe what they believe.    I urge all of you to examine this from another perspective; Michael Behe's excellent book "Darwin's Black Box" which will explain something of the biochemistry, or Philip Johnson's "Darwin On Trial" which will explain some of the VAST problems with the fossil record and the never-yet-located missing links.      Darwin was completely confident that the fossil record would be littered with the transitional forms that evolution depends on.      A hundred years after he wrote "The Origin Of Species," the fossil record is the same: stasis.  Things the same for a long time.    New species appearing suddenly then disappearing suddenly, with no transitional forms at all.    No evidence at all that one species evolves into another.  None.    No good hominids other than us: apes and men, again with no transitional forms.    Francis Crick, Nobel laureate, was so disgusted with this state of affairs that he came up with the theory of directed panspermia, which amounts to "aliens designed us."    If he is taken seriously in scientific circles, how is it such a big stretch to get from "aliens designed us" to "God designed us?"    This system is too complex to have gotten here by chance, when one molecule out of place in our atmosphere would bollox the whole thing.     Even Dawkins, the most radical of evolutionists, was very clear that our biosphere has the appearance of design.      The difficulty is an ideological one: if God created us, we are accountable to Him.    If we are clever pond scum, we can do whatever we want with no accountablity.    So where do you stand?  Party on, dude, for tomorrow we may evolve into glue, or get your act together, humanity, because the Creator is watching, and He loves you.

The word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this.     It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.    It seems to me that the idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I cannot take seriously. I also cannot imagine some will or goal outside the human sphere.... Science has been charged with undermining morality, but the charge is unjust. A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary.

God doesn't appear anywhere in that equation, or in any of the equations in General Relativity for that matter.    The claim that Einstein was convinced by an equation in GR that God exists is such a lie made up by theists to make it appear that their God exists.  ____|`|Wyq8JflDaa	That is totally BOGUS.

And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. As far as my experience goes, they are no better than other human groups, although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power. Otherwise I cannot see anything 'chosen' about them."[63]    His friend Max Jammer explored Einstein's views on religion thoroughly in the 1999 book Einstein and Religion: Physics and Theology.[64]

MUkC93kUaa	I am in agreement with Donna; life is what you make it.      However, at times, life is far from fair.      Life isn't fair when genocide occurs.  Life isn't fair when a child dies of malnutrition or simply of starvation.  Life isn't fair when an infant dies of neglect.  Life isn't fair when a teenager is diagnosed with cancer and is told that, inevitably, they will die.        But for most of us, life will be fair if we perceive it to be.  There's always something positive.  It may be small, but small things are nothing more than something to build on.  We can take small things and focus on them, work to improve them, and make them something great.    Just as we can do with our lives.|`|pKW7Zf4Taa	I see a lot of poetic justice in the world.

The problem is I would not listen, when I was young I knew it all. so most people will not listen now. then later realize I wish I would have listened to my grandpa.I believe you can be any body you want to be. It does not matter what color you are.

There is no fate or destiny-- what happens to you is either due to your own choices or the choices of other people, with luck thrown in sometimes. Is life always fair? No, because sometimes you or other people make stupid choices and sometimes things that happen are out of your control (cancer, early death, death of loved ones, etc). That's where "life is what you make it" comes into play. Unfair things may happen, but you're the one who chooses how to handle them.|`|4oeCbVRFaa	it depends on the person and the situation. bad things happen to good people. but it all depends on the attitude you have for life. the worst situation can ruin you outlook on life, or you can make the best of it. but also what comes around, goes around , so people who make bad decisions will pay for them in the long run.|`|uExBtn0xaa	For some people maybe.

e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Some of it happens because of our bad choices:  things like drought, starvation, and global warming are probably included in those bad choices.  For those, God expects us to feed our hungry brothers and to help those who have less than us.  That's not communism;  it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ.    But other stuff, natural disasters like earthquakes and accidents like car wrecks and disease like cancer, is probably not caused by any one particular person's actions.  They just are.  Theologians and philosophers have been arguing about that for more than 20 centuries.  They call it theodicy, and they still don't have an answer.    It might be good to look at what God said to Job when Job stood up and demanded God account for all his misfortune:  God pretty much said "You are human and limited.  I am God and unlimited."  (paraphrase of course)  Does that mean that God has reasons that we're too limited to understand?  Your guess is as good as mine.|`|tsgP2JfBaa	He doesn't.

Why doesn't He stop it?  Can He or is He weaker than we think?  Suffering can fall into three simple categories: emotional, mental, and physical suffering.  But, there are a variety of causes for suffering:  morally corrupt (evil) people, disease, earthquakes, floods, famine, etc.       There are different explanations for why God allows suffering, but none of them can satisfy everyone.  Therefore, I will simply list various reasons offered to account for suffering and evil in the world.   |`|AA11951392	God does not create the pain and suffering Man does     Everything happens for a reason and if you search deep you find the reason     "God writes straight with crooked lines".

God's love is universal and God all ways want the best for us. But it is us who choose misery & hardship, pain & suffering.    Towards an example, God was providing the best food, that none was bestowed with to the House of Israel but they chose food that is produced from earth.    It was Prophet Job who chose sufferings for himself, it wasn't God. No doubt it raised up his ranks in the eyes of God, but God never wanted to put him under pain & suffering!    It is we (in general) that envoy whereas God has asked to be content in ourselves and be patient.    God Loves but at the same time He goes by the rule.|`|KLXUghJxaa	God allows pain and suffering to those he loves because it's part of life that everyone has to go though and a good example is the story about Job in the book of Job.|`|myhxExgqaa	The point of suffering is to draw closer to God.

Have you ever sinned rather it is lying to someone or said something to hurt someone feelings? If you answered yes to any sin, how would you feel if God was to stop you every time you did a sin that he was against especially a sin that would cause someone to stumble? God gives us free will. He is not a royal pain in the butt dad or mom who goes around with a fine tooth comb making sure we aren't doing wrong. If we fall and scrape our needs we don't need God standing there to pick us up or there to correct us when we do wrong. We learn from trials and tribulation and hopefully through someone else mistakes and faults we can learn not to be like them.|`|rTkqpATpaa	I think you know my answer already.|`|biPAZ2TVaa	Because He will give such joy to them later.

9e1382105ae7043f569801d129e0b8d2aa	I think a definition of "old" depends on what age you are looking.    Most kids look forward to 16 and a drivers license.  Then of course the drinking age of 18.  After which comes that magic number of 25, where insurance companies now consider you settled down enough and they lower the premium on your car, provided you didn't mess up by wrecking a few times and a DUI or two along the way.   From 25, there is a pretty good span of time before age is even considered, but then one day, maybe around 40 or 45, he or she sees a gray hair.  OMG!  That means, you're getting older!!  And of course, out comes the hair dye and the workouts and all the things one can do to maintain that youthful figure.  And it works for most.  But then, there comes the 50's and O Lordy me, now it's a battle trying to keep parts from sagging and drooping, but try as we might, gravity does take over and by 65, the average person is old chronologically.  Oh the mental part is still young, but for most, it's over.  Mother Nature says things are going to sag and you will wrinkle.  And they do.    Depending on how old you are, all those plateaus we reach are but markers along the way.  Nobody wants to grow old.  For sure it isn't a pleasant thought that you are going to be senile and forget your grand daugher's name or remember where you are.  But it happens and those who look down on old people... just remember while they can, they'll be there some day.    How anybody determines how "old" is to be established just depends on where you are chronologically in your own life.|`|00B394HBaa	Old is a state of mind.

QJwOhM0qaa	I don't think the thing is to forget the bad things done but rather it is to be able to live with the knowledge of those things and not let those things screw your life up.  I think you've got to start with forgiveness because in forgiveness you sort of take responsibility for what happened and get out of a victim mentality. Once that is done then the fact that whatever was done to you was done by another person becomes sort of irrelevant. Then you can look at the injury as you would any other, as a temporary pain that came and will eventually subside.   That's not to say you should forget the bad thing, like I said the idea is to be able to deal with it not forget it. I think its important to remember who did what in order to learn from our mistakes. |`|AA11894640	Its no doubt extremely difficult.  But we can try by thinking from the other person's viewpoint....      Some times we get an idea why they behaved the way they did.  Though it doesn't reverse the damage,  it lessens the pain to some degree.      I have tried that in my married life (my mom-in-law) and found some solace.  People sometimes DO realise their mistake and ask for forgiveness (like she did) and that helps clear the cob-webs...|`|FrLDHBLfaa	You don't.

Sorry, I had to get that in before someone else..|`|0raVFnaiaa	You can't. You just have to not let it dominate your thoughts and not let them get the better of you. Never stoop to their level.|`|5bkmSQ3Raa	I'm not positive that any of us ever fully forget the bad things that have been done to us, but there is this amazing tool called forgiveness that is extremely powerful.  We all have the capacity to be more forgiving to ourselves and to others, and the act of truly forgiving really does "clean the slate."  However, the memory of what has been done...or what we think has been done...is something that we may carry with us forever.  It really does come down to how much love we're willing to find in our hearts.  |`|AA11841749	Accept that it has happened and move on with your life.  People are mean sometimes.  You just have to blow it off and know that good things are going to happen for you.  Don't be upset for what bad people have done to you.  It will come back to them later.|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	You don't. They say time heals all wounds. This is not true, it just lessens the impact.

However, when you realize that we all have our share of bad things to deal with, and later as the years go bye, we look back and most times we can see, how we dealt with the bad things, helped form our character and prepared us to deal with even worse things!

Mankind is slowly beginning to realize this aspect of life.  ~~~~~  If one gains clarity of mind the "Truth" will reveal itself and share its very "Essence".  There is a certain beauty within all things and this beauty must be seen through the "Eye of Wisdom".  When this is realized, one will witness (observe) that forgetting and forgiving are one in the same.  They are simply mirrored aspects (qualities) of that which each human being must imbibe within their "Inner Heart". These mirrored aspects (qualities) will be experienced and finally shared with other human beings. When this is recognized one will have understood the quality known as "Compassion".    May we all forgive and forget....|`|afda1acbe2b07d5ae46be46c01fedf54aa	You don't. If you are gifted with the capability of understanding God then you must have some love inside. Love is the medicine that will completely cure the memory of that pain. I think it is through acceptance and then letting go.

Yet, they can be dealt with, managed and transitioned through.    Through life's experiences I've learned to feel the emotion...Allow self to "grieve" what's happened.  Have also learned not to "push" the feelings (bad memories) out...Instead I've learned to RELEASE it.    The memories that remain are transitioned into "gifts" of lessons.  When "bad" things are seen as "gifts" of lessons, then growth in wisdom, discernment, inner strength, and patience increase.

If we all got what we deserved, we'd all be in trouble.    No, not less worthy.  But people who are obsessed by "stuff" are distracted, I think...confused about what is really important.

But there are many kinds of addiction.  Glass houses, don't you know.|`|qEh84eqNaa	I don't think their "less worthy", because everyone has worth, but I do think they tend to be more easily corrupted. From what I've observed in my own life, and from history, and from books that are satires on the author's time period and hence reflect what humans were like during said time period (like Great Expectations by Charles Dickens), as the love of money goes up, morals go down.|`|M2UWOTAjaa	For one thing calling a person materialistic is a value judgement. The judger is obviously more spiritual, and hence much better than a materialist.  A materialist, in philosophical terms, is a person who believes that everything is made of matter. Usually this results in atheism, but there have been plenty of famous atheists who were very charitable to suffering humanity. I know quite a few atheists, and they are much better people than most of the Christians I meet. They're simply humans who don't believe in God. They believe in being good, ethical, kind and so on, but not in hell or heaven They do good things because they know that these things are worth doing for their own sake.  The core of the problem is mistaking materialism for consumerism. Consumers might be crazed Christians who yell "Praise the Lord!" every time they get some money, but they go right out and spend it on electronic toys, automobiles, homes, vacations, and so forth. Those who are consumerists wear religion as a mask.

If I call someone I don't like a redneck, I'm probably attacking them for starting an unneccessary fight or sticking a Confederate flag up outside the house.|`|AA11616953	The usual American!|`|CMN5QL6Kaa	Best I can tell, I am not one.

Anthropologists have studied this in depth. The Jews were very focused on guilt. Since Christianity and Islam both came out of Judaism, they are very focused on guilt as well, and its corollary, blame. The ancient Greeks had a very narrow sense of sin. What was terrible in Greek eyes was shame (this was true of Rome too, and the Celtic societies). In ancient Greece you could be a pirate but as long as you were doing the expected thing at home, there was no shame involved.  Ror Romans it was not a sin to kill someone (a father could kill his wife or his children), but it was politically dangerous, so in order to avoid the shame of a trial, most people stayed within the law. This is why Gaius Julius Caesar,for example, could execute so many people on his list of enemies - it was not a sin, nor was it shameful. This was a different culture, and so Caesar cannot be called a sociopath.  About 4% of the general population can feel neither guilt nor shame. These people are sociopaths, because other people mean nothing to them.|`|slP2fd8eaa	because some people havent' found christ yet|`|6fqHD126aa	Guilt is like a bag of bricks.    You can put it down.

d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Faith means believing in something that you cannot produce credible evidence to support. I have faith that certain things will happen. This is based on world experience and cognitive reason. However, I cannot prove that these will happen until they actually do. It does not mean that I should not believe in these things if they bring me comfort. However, it does mean that I do not have the right to judge others if they do not share my faith.|`|OKClYfDQaa	Conviction.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase.  - Martin Luther King Jr.    I'll go with that. :]|`|AA11096726	A firm confidence in a sure knowledge|`|AA10637643	Faith - believing in something you have not physically seen.

I don't really have much use for faith. Facts are a different matter.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	To me it means belief in people or something good happening. To the religious it means belief in a religion and deities which canot be seen by the simple eye.|`|yyvotdVYaa	Faith is not knowing nor caring what is true.|`|IDcIww7Baa	A belief in that which is unseen.|`|pMpaQDMtaa	In the context of religion, it means to me desperation.

Pxs60mVdaa	Very thought provoking.  I would say that would depend on the injustice being portrayed against another.  In some case's, the Only mercy that can be given by the oppressor.   Is a Bullet in the head of the oppressed.|`|M2UWOTAjaa	There is a delicate line here. Justice must include mercy, otherwise it's just law, and justice is a higher principle than law. On the other hand mercy can be exercised outside the realm of law, as when someone forgives your debts. Mercy is also involved in medicine - can you imagine how awful it would be if we never gave out pain medication to patients because we thought they should tough it out?|`|KAKXZw0Qaa	No -but we Humans have a hard time even answering this question LOL|`|OKClYfDQaa	Disqualified.|`|uxfacsgmaa	Depends on your definition of mercy and justice. |`|AsyB1qLyaa	Interesting!    Mercy: not being given what we deserve  Just: being given what we deserve    You put a negative before Just, so you must mean that merciful is the opposite of Justness.     I think you are right.|`|kTaa8ejpaa	God displayed mercy by giving us His son as a perfect sacrificial lamb which Judaic law requires for the atonement of sin.  He is often called the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world.  Like I said, that is mercy.    God has also told you and I how to avail ourselves of this mercy by accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour, confessing him with our mouths and believeing in our heart that God has raised him from the dead.    Your failure to take advantage of this free love gift from God will result in your seeing his justice.  You will spend eternity apart from God in eternal torment.  Don't even go down that path.    See, mercy and justice works together.  Most people want God to be merciful on their terms when he has already set his plan in place and his word is unchanging and true.    I presume you think that God is not just because some who commit particular sins and who won't come to Christ have a hellish destination.  Are you trying to convince us or yourself that God is a meanie?    For reference, understand that to be saved one must be born again in the spirit, just like Jesus told Nicodemus he must be in John 3:3 and reemphasized by Jesus in John 3:7.  What I mentioned above regarding confessing Jesus with your mouth and believeing he was raised from the dead by God is being born again and you can find it in Romans 10:8-10.    |`|iVv6bFW2aa	It's possible if a judge gives a lenient sentence to soeone who has been convicted beyond a reasonable doubt.|`|RqC1s733aa	Absolutely.|`|pfNnuD5saa	Yes. A young girl cried mercy, mercy as she went to plead her fathers case to Napoleon,. Napoleon said your father is guilty of treason and deserves to die. She answered I asked for mercy, not justice. Her father was pardoned.

Jesus HATES rich people, too...!!! Christians won't admit!     By believing in Jesus and being saved the Bible writers tell you that you will get one of the first seats in Heaven to watch how the vast majority of all the human beings perhaps into the TRILLIONS including your unsaved family members and old acquaintances will be especially tormented one by one in a sulfuric lake of fire or what have you for ever and ever. You will be encouraged to poke fun at them showing a wet big finger for them to lick to quench their thirst because in Hell there is no fresh water and you can tease them all you want for ever and ever! Thats HEAVEN! No wonder Jesus said that you must hate your father and your mother and everybody else to follow him, especially if they are "unsaved" and go to HELL! You will hear a lot of I told you so from Sweet Jesus! He thought of everything even some low IQ teasing games that WE CAN ALL PLAY with the damned in Hell! Heaven is for the childlike poor and uneducated so please bear with me in this story right out of Gods Holy Word, the Bible!    Luke 16:23-25-NIV (Jesus is telling us) AND BEING IN TORMENTS IN HELL, he* (*Not a gay person, or a Godless Atheist, or and abortionist, but a rich Jewish person whom Jesus knew personally! In those days to be rich was the fad sin of the day.) lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom* (*If you go to Hell you will recognize EVERYBODY in Heaven, and vise versa!). Then he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; FOR I AM TORMENTED IN THIS FLAME. (and Jesus all excited and turned on like mad continues the story telling) But Abraham said, Son* (*Abraham was an ancestor of this rich man! Notice how little compassion any member of your own family will have on you if you end up in Hell!), remember that in your lifetime you received your good things* (*in this story, to be rich is a sin! Christian preachers now use it to make it applicable to ANY SIN!), and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted* (* for all eternity, for ever and ever, and ever! billions and trillions of years!!!) and YOU ARE TORMENTED! Believe it or not, there is hardly any other specific description in the Bible of what else any Christian will be doing in Heaven except for worshiping this egotistic Bible God!    The Bible God promised the Jews to be rich lenders not borrowers like this rich man in Hell, otherwise IF THEY DONT OBEY they will be poor slaves and borrowers like Lazarus! This story is more proof that nothing in the Bible makes any sense or can be taken seriously! Thats why I get a lot of email telling me that not everything in the Bible in factual! Especially the silly teasing words that Sweet Jesus aka Creator of the Universe is dreaming up in anticipation of the day when he will personally enjoy watching the Christians POKING FUN AT ALL THOSE IN HELL FOR EVER AND EVER for not believing in Jesus, or for never hearing about him, or not having the mental faculties in order to accept Jesus, and to obey the clergy, and pay the tithes and offerings ON TIME! It will be a long time before anybody in Heaven can possibly get bored! Christians hate homosexuals, atheists, abortionists, and what have you. Only Jesus knows what other torments await for those in HELL!!! Low IQ people will love to be entertained for ever like that or wouldnt they? But what the heck! It is all in the Bible that Christians hardly read!    Luke 19:27 (NIV) (Jesus is very excited telling this other story, too!) But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over thembring them here AND KILL THEM IN FRONT OF ME!* (*Not even the Mafia measures up to Jesus!

For free, informed and impartial advice on "The Current Financial Crisis", send your check, payable to...............|`|AA10071724	The financial crisis is a man made problem. We causes and we must figure it out ourselves.  That's is a product of free will.  God gave us free will to make our own choices and mistakes, and the live with them and try to rectify them.  That's the problem with people like you.  You screw up and then look to god to fix it for you. When He doesn't you assume that He doesn't exist.   I believe that is called laziness.  |`|1CS2KR7Taa	There are lessons to be learned here:  What God, or Nature is showing us, that we are totally interconnected, it is not a rich man's problem, not a capitalist problem, not an american problem, it is a problem for the whole of humanity.  Our evolution has reached the state when we are truly global, all of us are dependent on the others.  But we are connected in an incorrect manner, trying to use the others, and we do not trust each other.  The financial crisis is just a superficial sign of that.  The basic law of nature, or creation is that everything is in balance, or tries to achieve balance, except humanity, and now we getting the blows for it.  We have to learn the system of laws around us, and start living accordingly.  Here is a video on how we can change all of that:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptIlXLzDV...

Give unto Cesar what belongs to him. Give unto God what belongs to God.  In other words whatever the government decides is what we must live by here on earth until it stops us from giving ourselves to God. That's where we draw the line. As far as Capitalism? It's been proven and will continue to be proven. Why else do people from all over the world (including the ones that say they hate us) still come for a taste of what we have.  Capitalism took this country to the forefront of the world and despite its many flaws still shows more fairness and equality than any other system in the world.   Who freed the slaves? Capitalist republicans. Which countries create slaves and unprecedented poverty? Socialists.

0fEBJinjaa	Yeah, it's pretty weird. But lots of religious people do that - pick and choose what they want to believe from their holy book. Like, "Oh, well, that part is obviously metaphorical, and those contradictions don't matter because it's the overall idea that counts, and I prefer this part to that one." It's odd, but people are always going to be like that.|`|PjzXJgqAaa	I was raised Catholic.  I'm not into it anymore.  We used to burn people at the stake for saying the world was not the center of the universe.  It seems silly now, but I suppose it made us feel good at the time.  Eventually we found out that the heretics were right.  We all had a good laugh about it and then had to settle down to figure out what we were going to do about this religion thing.  We could either just pack it in and say it was an unfortunate mistake or we could redefine the Bible.  We chose the latter and decided that the Bible taught moral lessons and not scientific lessons.|`|g7wuTmA0aa	You ever think that maybe Gen 1 is a general statement or a quick description of creation all together.  Ever think that Gen 2 is then a follow up on details to Gen 1? People do it wile talking all the time, say some quick story then go back and get the details.  The thing about the Bible is that it must all be right or its all wrong. Its twined in such a way that it must be total truth, because if one thing is false then whats to say the rest is fake? Most people who call themselves Christens do so because they don't know what else to call themselves. They know they are not Satanists, Druids, Buddhists, Muslims, Atheists, and so on, but they believe in a god of some sort. Becoming Christan isn't some sort of title to just place on you because it seems to fit. It is a faith that wile in it, must be studied and believed in all the way.    All or nothing.  No they are not.  |`|f3nwI8ytaa	I'm pretty sure you're wrong in your facts.  You limit belief to a particular hermeneutic that equates the creation narrative to a scientific model of origins.  And you're probably right that many Christians don't follow such an interpretive framework.  But that's a far cry from saying they don't believe it.  Ask any Christian you meet if they believe that God is the creator of the universe and I bet they'll say yes.  I sure have never met nor read any who say otherwise.  The first account is a prologue to the book, the second begins the narrative proper with a literary device using "generations".  The entire book of Genesis can be outlined by noting the phrase, 'these are the generations of...'.    Is it so hard to accept that a person can believe a religious text without turning it into a modern scientific discourse?  I sure don't find it so.    peace  -----------------------  I'm not question the fact of two accounts.  Just your statement that most Christians don't "believe" them.

But  since their grammar is not so good, they use present tense instead of past tense.    In fact God had chosen them under certain conditions. They were required to be righteous, following God's Covenant honestly and they had agreed to accept any new prophet that God may send.    But by knowingly rejecting Jesus and Muhammad, they fell from favor and by legalizing interest and ignoring  Sabbath, they were rejected and turned into lousy monkeys.     But the Jews are still living in the past and assume that God is still with them.

The real chosen people of ancient Israel are outcast who never returned back to their true land.|`|pfNnuD5saa	You grossly misunderstand. God chose them to be under His law and be His people. It certainly hasn't been great for them. I love this by Rabbi Simmons     All human beings are God's people, as it says that Adam and Eve were created in the image of God. Further, the great prophet Malachi said, "Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us?" (Malachi 2:10) In fact, the Talmud also states that Adam was created from the dust of all four corners of the earth (so to speak) so that no one nation could claim the distinction of being better.   Historically, however, the world slipped away from its relationship with God, and eventually the entire world was idolaters. Abraham re-discovered the idea of one God, and chose to accept the challenge to change the world through an understanding of monotheism and morality. Through his dedication and willingness to give up everything for God, he was chosen - and his descendants after him - to become the teachers of morality.     In other words, Abraham chose God, and thus God chose Abraham.     With blessings from Jerusalem  Rabbi Shraga Simmons|`|AA10613962	The Torah is NOT a "storybook"! It is the Word of the Most High God who gave it to the nation of Israel. The Jewish folks have said that all nations were given an opportunity to come under contract with God.

It is so inspired even the failures of its greatest heroes are recorded.  It is so scientific, science is trying to catch up with it.  It is so ancient, humans have no better biographer.  You only need to read Daniels to understand that it is the written words of GOD; everything predicted is being fulfilled with frightening rapidity.  Even the travails of Israel were predicted, some by as much as 3000 years before they took place but fulfilled so accurately you would think it was documented after they took place.  GOD Himself calls Israel His witness in the book of Isaiah, not because they were perfect but because they had in them the ability to respect GOD to the level of writing as inspired even it that showed their frailties.   Time and space will fail me, but if you can read the Bible again without bias you will discover so much you would cry for joy.|`|5ebe06be40baad7f6f2c066958e785bdaa	To reinforce the omnipotence of the kings.

8Nqq7tkwaa	now thats a good one. let's see so far i have learned from yahoo answers that we are from:  1. atlantis  2. mongolia  3. jerusalem  4. europe  5. egypt  6. siberia  and like the mormon said...dark skinned people are cursed by god. just now they say yeah but none of them are around anymore..ahem. we are not any lost tribe of israel and we don't have any stories about a white brother from the distant past. those are lies told by missionaries to make us convert.     geez if people aren't telling us where we came from then they are telling us where to go!|`|o4UrRbTvaa	They actually do/did believe that the Native Americans were one of the lost tribes.

Flavius Josephus was of the opinion that Adam was originally red because he apparently misinterpreted Adam as Edom (Red, like Esau).    We do believe that some inhabitants of the Jerusalem area emigrated prior to the Babylonian invasion.  Some of them were among the many invasions of the New World, though their gene pool has probably been diluted beyond detection by now.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Hm. Your question has a number of elements.    Did today's Native Americans originally come from Jerusalem? Some may have, but most of the those who were in that family were killed off about 400 years into the common era.    Did God turn Native Americans' skin red? I didn't realize it was red, any more than my skin is white.    There were groups of people who were so disobedient that they became a dark and loathsome race, yes. But as to having survived to our day? See my first response.    Given the size of the Hebrew nation during the time of Isaiah, finding a person who has traceable ancestry to compare against a known descendant of Lehi (a little hard to do considering the destruction of the peoples and civilizations), DNA is not proof one way or another. We know that there is Caucasian influence in Mongoloid peoples - that a little blond-haired, hazel-eyed Mongolian is DNA-wise, the direct descendant of a warrior princess buried in Russia, that is a fact. But then, there was ample evidence that such might be the case, in support of the Amazon Warriors of Greek legend.    What is missing is any known ancestor with viable DNA who lived at the time of Isaiah and who likely might have a descendant in America who has been isolated as this little Mongolian girl had.    We believe the Book of Mormon to be a record of a group of people who lived on the American continent. In the past, it was a common thought that all Native Americans were descended from these people, but is not seen that way today. There are legends among certain Native American tribes (the Hopi, for instance) that speak of a white brother who once visited them and will come again. Both Cortez and Cook were greeted by the natives as the "returning white, bearded God." The architecture of the ancient ruins shows strong resemblance to architecture found in Egypt. There are a lot of things that point to the credibility of LDS ("Mormon") beliefs.    Edit: It should be noted that not all Native American tribes have ancestral legends like the Hopi, but some do. Just because yours does not does not invalidate the legends of others.|`|u42chaAjaa	Mormons are crazy      Everyone needs to leave Native Americans alone, they have been through too much |`|PA3pDzjoaa	They are a little more quiet in that claim now...DNA evidence has ruled that out COMPLETELY...but it is a central theme in the book of mormon, and Joseph Smith taught it as an absolute truth.|`|oVHFz52Laa	Mormons have so many chaged teachings that it is hard to know what they think now.

"I saw a striking contrast in the progress of the Indian people . . . they are fast becoming a white and delightsome people. . . . For years they have been growing delightsome, and they are now becoming white and delightsome, as they were promised . . . The children in the home placement program in Utah are often lighter than their brothers and sisters in the hogans on the reservation.

God does put leaders into place- I have no doubt of that.  However, if you know the story at all you will also know that He allows leaders to be put into office that is not His first choice.  Saul was not the person that God wanted as King- it was David-   However, because the people wanted a ruler like Saul, God gave him to them, and even anointed him to be King.  At the end of Saul's reign, do you remember what God did?  He grieved over making him King.  America asked for Obama , we got him, and God help us and send us mercy.

5Bpzt3Cnaa	Hello  I'm not an Iranian  , but I gonna answer to ur Question    Iranians people are Aryans people who live in actual Asia (exactly in Iran) They are Indo-Europeans by their language who is Farsi (Persian).Because Indo-European is properly a term who is linguistical , it means that all people who speak an indo-european language (as French or Armenians) are considered to be indo-europeans , so on , there is no indo-european race ....There is no aryan bortherhood : Germans and Armenians arent aryans people , they are indo-europeans people in their own way .Hitler 's belief was a LIE ===> this is a fact : germans arent aryans , in Europe people dont know exactly what is "ARYAN" there are people who remember of "aryan nazim's theory" and many  people who know that's people like Iranians are Aryans .    You are a Persian  (an Iranian though) and you have your own culture and language , beeing indo-european like you said , dont make you european , don't listen to youtube's people ,there are many crazy videos who talk about many things who arent always true  , these people arent linguistic scientists or Historians, that's true many europeans are considered indo-europeans because they speak indo-europeans languages as french , spanish, english,german or also russian but many Asian people are also considered Indo-Europeans people (as Kurds or Iranians ).    -EDIT-  @Immortal Berhuz:  Cause they're racists , of course that's many Indians are actually Aryans as well as Kurds and Pakistanis people are aryans. Hindi or Sanskrit of India are actually aryans languages  , in the XVI century a groups of aryans tribes migrated to Northern India and bring the Vedic culture and the Sanskrit language there....
q6KmVWS1aa	I think personally, that its ignorance that religions have.  All religions think they are right, and by judging others it may make themselves feel good.  I am Christian and I know that not all people will agree with me Christian or not, the simple basic is I think we can learn off of each other.  What we should be doing is not condemning anyone to Hell that is not our call.    It is up to the individual and we forget that God is our judge and we aren't supposed to judge others.  If we judge others we're disobeying what the Bible says.  It says "Judge not that we be not judge".  There is only one judge and that is God.   I don't want Atheist to think that I am purposely throwing the Bible at them.  Because that isn't right for me to do so.  I am supposed to show my life to others to let them see how I truly live.  What I think Christians don't realize, that the more that we condemn others, the stupider we look, because we are making our religions in vain.  And the condemnation that we are putting on others make God look bad.    He is about love, not hate.  And its not doing us any good on R&S to say to others "you're going to Hell" because we're making the situations worst.  There's gonna be a lot of Christians in Hell too.    Why do I say that?  Disobedience.  That's why.    It's not up to us anyways to tell others what to believe or what not to believe.      Every man doeth that which seemeth right in his own eyes.

There is also lack of humbleness on both sides: those against and those pro the issue are extremely proud of ourselves, and that is negative. Pride does not closes up, but disperses.|`|3qqvFEsHaa	I see the opposite.  I dont see Christians as people want to be free to believe what they choose, they are people who want to impose their beliefs on everyone else.  Actually I know this, because history backs me up 100%    This isn't saying there are not atheists who make fun of Christian's beliefs, but if anyone started it, it would be the Christians when they decided to burn and behead "blasphemers"    Edit: Oh Christians are still imposing their religion today.  Just look at proposition 8.  Also check out what missionaries are doing in Nigeria if you get the time.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	You seem to have identified the problem yourself!!    No mention of any other religion than christianity!!    Ask yourself why it is only Christians that get attacked and not the other religions?!!!!    Do you not recognise that Christians are provoking retaliation and repudiation for their terrible attitudes?!!    Perhaps if Christians stopped their intolerant, egotistical, hate filled and bigoted postings things might change!!     Perhaps if Christians stopped eschewing education, science, evolution works of fiction and much, much more things might change!!     Perhaps if Christians stopped being the only religion opposing human rights and persecuting gays, pro choice and so much more things might change!!     Perhaps if Christians stopped demanding freedom of religion whilst they deny it to all non Christians and persecute them things might change!! !!!    If Christians rediscovered the god of love and forgiveness and put aside all those terrible human emotions things would definitely change!!!!  |`|7J69CQvTaa	Both sides think the other one is completely wrong. What do you expect?    There is not much lenience when it comes to discussion of religion. Either you think it's bullsh*t or you follow it.    P.S: I don't think you are an atheist.|`|AA11149408	I, too, see this, and from many sides.  It is so prevalent that it can't be "hate".  This much "hate" if it existed in the "real world" would cause our self destruction.    Perhaps, at its best, it is simply a poor attempt to make sure our single, quiet voice is heard above the roar.

6kUx7fwcaa	The roots of Halloween can be found in the spirit of man and his need to explain the changing of the seasons.  Since man (an woman) have usually thought of themselves as the measure of all things, they related changes in the seasons to periods in their own life: birth, life, senescence, and death.  Eventually, as man's consciousness changed, he related these events to specific dates.  Man has had some form of celebration around this time of year since man has had the time to celebrate (and not just worry about existence).    Personally, I like any interpretation that translates into collecting candy and other goodies for nothing.  Shucks! I just remembered, I have to buy something to hand out, too, so it isn't received for nothing!    Let's rename it Candyland Day!  Christmas can become Toyland and Garment Day!  New Year's Day can stay New Year's Day.|`|e9d8ed677012c6dd7297705890dd520aaa	I  believe it's the tooth fairy's holiday because of all the candy.  or maybe the American Dental Associations.  Maybe both work together to rake in the bucks.      Yeah, that's it, the ADA pays the tooth fairy to put those quarters under the bed.  Meanwhile, she brings the teeth back to and evil lab where they make them into dentures.  Then they push candy related holidays to make teeth replacement necessary.  |`|8ab3o89Taa	It's the day when spirits can come back and visit this world, so it is a day of the dead.

It is different for everyone.  Another thing that could play a factor is the races that the Latin women grew up around. If say she grew up around black men, then she might feel more comfortable around them than of men of another race.  It's more of a personal thing, saying this is kind of stereotyping us. For example, one of the people who answered showed Chris Brown as a guy that Latin girls find attractive. I PERSONALLY, and no offense to anyone, think that he isn't cute AT ALL. So it really just depends on the individual. I personally like white guys, lol, however in the end race is not an ultimate factor for me.

U24VtSlZaa	God specifically gave you dominion over your pets.  That means he delegated to you the responsibility of caring for them, and part of caring for them is to know when it's time to let go.    At this point in your pet's life, it's only alive because you have provided a comfortable, safe environment.  Without you, it would've died long ago.  In the final analysis, no matter how attached we become, they're animals.  Our animals, but animals nonetheless.    Do what you gotta do.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	Yes I feel it is acceptable to end their suffering.|`|XxDQGEalaa	Yes it's OK. If you have ever had to see a pet of yours get so sick that they have trouble walking, eating, or going to the bathroom, then you might see it as a release of pain.     I had to do that to the family dog, and there was literally nothing else we could do for him...his body was just failing with age.|`|wwdllMzYaa	i dont think its "okay" i think its a better option than them suffering needlessly when you can help end that suffering  i had to do it myself, i didnt want to, i had no choice, as i knew i always would do that for my baby cat, no matter how much it messed me up    however as i dont believe in a god, im not sure my answer is relevant here|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Consider this.  If they were in the wild, they would die, suffering, or be killed by a predator.    I've done it, as many others have.|`|fEkKuGlEaa	Yes. When we accept the responsibility for an animal we accept all the responsibility. They have no need to work through end of life issues as people do, no way to tell us when the pain is worse than being alive.     It is a hard, hard thing to do but it is a way of showing mercy.|`|mSFjbetxaa	Yes.    I had to put down the very best friend I ever had, and I still cry about it.

I've had to do so a couple of times in my life, in fact.      For that matter, I feel the same way about people who are terminal and wish to end it.  If they are of sound mind, and decide they've had enough, and are terminal, then I'm all for death with dignity.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Euthanasia in necessary.

If there is a God, couldn't he have given us the intelligence to humanely euthanize so that our friends did not have to be in pain?|`|AA12357988	Yes.  I am also fully in favor of legalizing euthanasia.

Why would anyone want their little baby to suffer? I know I wouldn't.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	Yes, I believe it is ok and merciful to euthanise a pet that is suffering and has no chance to recover. It's not easy to do, though. I am a veterinary technician (though I am currently working at a sanctuary as a care-taker, not as a vet tech) and I have seen many instances where it would have been downright cruel to force the animal to remain alive.   I also believe that people should be able to choose to die if they wish to and that assisted suicide should be legal.|`|tEn2nnsuaa	i collect stray cats and drop them in a pot of boiling water.|`|rp5jJu3saa	Losasha thats sick|`|2ogimlBxaa	Why wouldn't you want to put it out of its misery?

I could never put any of my animals down, but they were sick with normal diseases and not life threatening ones. Hence I could not know if the animal would survive or not. In the event the situation was a lot more serious and all hope was lost, and I actually saw the animal suffering, I would do everything to keep it comfortable. And would put it down only as a last resort.|`|xKLydoTpaa	not only do i think it is okay to put down your pet because it is suffering, i think it is your duty to do so.  the hard part is doing so because it is in the pets best interest and not yours|`|QTx0w3Gbaa	if you can help your pet's suffering, do so. but if you cant and it would only be causing the animal pain, it would be nicer to put it to sleep. but I'm sure that would be really hard to do. I had a dog that I got of the streets and it had worms. we got some of the worms out when we first took it to the vet but then we forgot to get the rest out. I feel bad now that maybe he is suffering. i know its an animal, but put yourself in its shoes.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	Well, I'm not going to get biblical about it, I will share my experience instead.  If your pet is sick, there will be a moment when you will see that it is time.  Sometimes they keep hanging on out of loyalty to us.  When my cat died, well, I spent a very hard night with her, I really hoped that she would pass on her own, but she kept hanging on by a thread.  I took her to the vet, and stayed in the room with her, she was suffering, and needed to be released.  I don't know if it was the "Godly" thing to do, but it was the humane thing to do.  I'm sorry if this is a decision you are facing today, it's hard to do, but there will be a moment when you will look in your pet's eyes and know that the time has come.  Until then enjoy the presence of your pet as much as possible while you still can.  Good luck...|`|bYDVTv7Maa	If they are to the point where they cannot enjoy their lives anymore and their whole life has just turned to suffering, then yes, I do believe it is okay, reasonable, humane, and logical to put your pet down.    I watched my dad's Rottweiler of 12 years gradually get worse and worse. She couldn't even walk without limping and whining, and hardly ate anything. She would just lie around all day, which wasn't anything like her.  FInally we put her down.    I think it would be plain cruel to make your pet, who I consider my child of sorts, have to go through that.    We are the people who domesticated animals, in the wild, they probably wouldn't have lived long enough to suffer that much and would be killed by another animal sooner or later in their weakened state.|`|GGUDvicaaa	It is animal abuse to let them suffer.
Yk1asOK4aa	The late Robert Funk knew how to use such gimmicks as the "vote using colored marbles" to get media attention. The Jesus Seminar has never captured the respect of Bible scholars to the extent that it has attracted journalists.    And some of the Jesus Seminar committee members (who help make the decisions as far as which texts from the Gospels are "authentic" statements of Jesus) aren't even trained scholars -- much less at all fluent in Koine Greek.    An example of a less-than-scholarly member is Paul Verhoeven, the director of the campish movie SHOWGIRLS. (He got on the committee because of being a friend of other members.)    Bottom line: The majority of the scholarly community (e.g. SBL members) has little regard for the Jesus Seminar, especially the more bombastic aspects. At the annual SBL meeting the Jesus Seminar often has a session or two but, relatively speaking, it is not particularly well attended. And with the passing of Bob Funk, it gets limited notice except for perhaps a few visiting journalists.    (By the way, I should point out that the founder of the Jesus Seminar, Robert Funk, WAS an outstanding Greek grammarian whom I had a great deal of personal interaction. I have great respect for his contributions to the study of Biblical Greek syntactical constructions. It is the Jesus Seminar -- of which he was one participant -- of which I was considerably less impressed. With Bob's passing, the Jesus Seminar has tended to drop off the radar in general.)      ===> I find it humorous that several have already thumbed-down my answer. I'm sure those critics have abundant first hand and professional experience with the Jesus Seminar.  I would be VERY INTERESTED in seeing my critics' assessment of why they find my critique of the Jesus Seminar less than helpful.  (After all, Yahoo Answers is known for the considerable expertise of its participants.)|`|xixyTaxBaa	No|`|IwlE0oFbaa	Yes, I've heard of it.        At the end of our lives, Jesus will vote us into heaven or hell.        I think that many like religions that support their lifestyles.|`|QgqYcRcWaa	The only authentic source of true worship is from the guidance of the Holy Spirit. until men can control the Holy Spirit of God, no matter the level of disguised ploy to undermine, they will continue to fail.  I wonder why apostate christians can not cover their faces in shame; I have never heard of a group of Muslims gathered to disparage the Koran.  See, it is not by compulsion to be a christian. If one can not believe the Bible in its entirety, such an one can take the walk instead of hidding under any guise to cause confusion.  The LORD GOD knows His own.|`|0J9OUzjdaa	Yes, the fools though they could vote on what Jesus said and what Jesus did not say.    The Bible says don't add to or take away from the Word of God.    Some people want to vote out parts of the Bible they don't like. They might as well be playing hop scotch.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	They produced an interesting set of translations of the Gospels, trying to capture the unique voices of each of the four Evangelists, instead of having a unified voice as is the common practice among translators.  As part of the process each member of the seminar voted on his estimate of the likelihood that a given quotation of Jesus had actually been spoken by Jesus.  The results are given by rendering these sections of text in color:  Red for almost certainly the words of Jesus, various shadings from pink to grey depending on how doubtful the quotation is.    The work of The Jesus Seminar is subjective and , of course highly controversial.  As with all serious biblical scholarship The Jesus Seminar is anathema to bible worshipers.|`|u3KhqAVvaa	It's a bad joke.

d1zz0Afwaa	Yes DNA mutates caused by a change in the code (AT GC)|`|lTx8Hoheaa	Actually, the evolution of DNA is the first step in evolution. Once the DNA evolves enough (after a LONG time), you begin to see changes.|`|urIm4YaBaa	The short explanation is that DNA can be altered. When it's altered, it doesn't encode quite the same information. Because it doesn't encode the same information, the cell it controls won't function in the exact same way. Little mutations can, therefore, cause differences throughout an organism's entire body.    A slightly longer explanation is that DNA has two modes in which mutations can occur: (1) environmental damage, and (2) replication error.    Evolution rarely occurs due to the first reason (damage to the DNA, such as from exposure to nuclear radiation). An oversimplification of replication would be:  1 - A substance called DNA helicase unwinds the DNA and splits it in half;  2 - A substances called DNA polymerase creates a copy of each half, thus creating two DNA molecules where one existed before.    DNA polymerase occassionally makes a mistake. The rate of mistakes is extremely low, but when they do occur, protein structures built on the bad "blueprint" can be altered.    There are a number of replication-based mistakes, such as point mutations (using the wrong nucleotide in a sequence), insertions (adding in new sequences), deletions (not copying a sequence), and translocation (switching the order of genes on a chromosome).    Our body has several repair mechanisms to prevent and correct errors, but they don't catch everything.    Mutations can cause a number of known issues in biological function. For example, Huntington's Corea is a disease based on a repeated insertion on the fourth chromosome. The altered protein can cause nerve cells to breakdown at a faster rate. This leads to motor control problems and cognitive impairment, ending in death when the body can no longer force the heart to beat or use the diaphragm to assist in breathing. All that, because of one insertion in one gene on one chromosome.    Mutations present in sex cells are passed on to offspring. Some mutations will result in death before reproductive age. Others will have no effect on the survival and reproduction of the offspring (such as changing eye color; research has recently shown that blue eyes are the result of a point mutation that prevents the iris from producing pigmentation, which has no effect on our survival). Finally, some can have a positive benefit to the organism's survival and/or reproduction, and thus will continue to be passed on.    It isn't that one species evolves into another. Rather, changes in the DNA in the parent due to known processes are passed on to the offspring. Positive differences pile up over several generations. The point at which we consider two different organisms to be different species is when the creatures can no longer reproduce due to the differences in their DNA, or due to their mode of reproduction. They may have had a mutual parent(s) several generations previously, but different genetic mutations have been passed on since that time. They have some inherited traits in common (just as we have several traits in common with all mammals, and just as all mammals have some traits in common with all animals), but they also have enough differences that they shouldn't be mistaken for the other.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Since evolution is a change in allele frequencies in DNA, yes, that is what happens.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Evolution can very well be defined as the change in DNA over time, with the changes of the organism's form being merely the outward expression of an inward change.  Of course that is akin to the saying that hens are simply eggs' way of making more eggs.|`|4sUek7ugaa	DNA is almost never copied exactly.  When you throw in sexual reproduction with DNA from two parents, the changes come even faster.    Differences come from small changes in DNA, not just in genes but in things like when during fetal development certain genes are activated.  There is an enormous number of ways the genome can change.|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	Each individual has unique DNA.  There are variations within populations.  For example, the difference between humans and chimps is about ten times the variation within the human population.  If you split a population, the subpopulations will diverge.|`|AA10096992	Yes, DNA evolves gradually as mutations occur. |`|4qj98nhdaa	Yes it does. The flu virus changes on an annual basis|`|Q8coTUJfaa	And DNA evolved from RNA, which is arguably the simplest form of life.    |`|AA11783622	It is a slow process... and as well, a beautiful one....      No one could explain it to you on this forum.    And if you read well, and have had your sophomore year in biology, and are truly interested,  write me.... and I'll give you a list of truly awesome books.   |`|KT7cllsLaa	It is called mutation.  The RNA make-up changes due to environmental influences.  The easiest example is virus, bacteria...  Penicillin does not kill many of them anymore..because, they mutated and become resistant.  It applies to all living.  The organism branches out and all tho, basis features ARE still the same, there are visible feature changes.  In higher organisms it is painstakingly long process over very long periods of time.|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	The theory is that DNA doesn't replicate accurately and causes mutations. Every once in a while, the mutation adds genetic information and it happens to be beneficial. After a lot of this happens, a new species has evolved.     The problem with the theory is that DNA replicates very accurately. In the rare cases that it doesn't, it hasn't ever been observed to be beneficial and it hasn't ever been observed to cause a different type of animal.     Also, as the fossil record becomes more complete, we don't see gradual shifts between species happening. This gave rise to the punctual equilibrium theory that states that species remain constant for many years and then rapidly change when the environment changes. The problem with this theory is that what we observe in real life is that the species just die out instead of adapting. |`|d265DZbHaa	It is the DNA which makes evolve. DNA mutates because it is a fusion the the two parents. What happens is that if the child fits better it breeds and passes it on. If the child does not fit then it dies out. simple!|`|b0NccAFFaa	That's another of the reasons why evolution is false. Healthy DNA does not change, even over long periods of time. And get this. When they do, through mutations, it is ALWAYS detrimental to the life of the species. The mutation is never passed on.    An easy way to understand this is by understanding how software works in a computer. The underlying language of software, the intelligence of the computer, is 1's and 0's. For a computer to work properly means that the software has to be written properly. In other words, the 1's and 0's all need to be in their proper place at the proper time, when the computer executes the software. If one "1" or 0" is not what it should be, a degradation of the software occurs and the computer will not run as it should. It's the same with DNA because DNA is also composed of pure intelligence; the coding which makes man a man, a potato a potato. If one piece of information in the DNA is out of whack, a mutation occurs. That person or potato  will not be able to perform as it should. This is a disadvantage and means that it will not survive, God has makes sure it never survives, for even if the mutated person or potato reproduces to make another person or potato, the mutated DNA is never passed on. It is always corrected in their offspring.    But evolutionists don't want you to know this.    here's a good web-site to read.    http://evolution-facts.org/Ev-V2/2evlch1...|`|zUkviN4Taa	Yes our genes evolve to a degree.     The stronger gene obliterates the weaker and so species are changed. Mostly the change is small and gradual yet in the grand scheme of things you can see huge changes. |`|93y6qc2paa	yes - you're right.|`|PeCJqQKpaa	everything has a unique DNA ur right.. im not convenced that evolution is real, scientest havent proven that evolution is right it's just a popular theory|`|1a09fa136e7665ab959724ed81d7230eaa	Correct, every single living thing has unique DNA.  But this is how evolution happens.  You have different DNA from your parents.  Your children will have different DNA from you.  If you go into the future 10,000 generations, your descendants will have very different DNA from you (from each change that happened at each generation).  It might even be to the point where they are a slightly different species.|`|141f43ea8a9dca3e4cdcecd496362617aa	No, 1 species cannot "evolove" into another.  Mutations are usually deleterious to an organism.  With regards to animals and man, there are a variety of repair systems to correct base-pair substitutions, sequences additions or deletions.  The intergrity of the sequence needs to be maintained.         Even in bacteria, a mutation does not change an E. coli into B. cereus!  "Evolution" is bad science if it can be called "science" at all.        If "evolution" is true.....why haven't starviing Ethiopians "evolved" photosynthesis?  There is plenty of sunlight in Africa and carbon dioxide is abundant.  If Ethiopians evoloved photosynthetic systems, there would be no starving people in that country!      
RGe6Et0Xaa	Gnosticism was an ancient pagan religion that incorporated a few Christian themes (but Gnosticism actually predates Christianity). It was a fusion of Semitic, Greco-Roman and Christian religious traditions. Most adherents believed that the material universe was created by a tyrannical Demigod, that matter was evil, and that people could only attain salvation through a spiritual knowledge or "gnosis" that was imparted through various means (usually excess, asceticism, philosophy, or secret rituals). Most believed that only a very few human beings were actually divine beings who had somehow fallen into the material universe and forgotten who they were.    Ancient gnosticism often embraced doctrines that early Christians considered blasphemous. Some Alexandrian Gnostics, for example, maintained that the God of the Old Testament was the menstrual discharge of the goddess Sophia, and that he was a donkey-headed monstrosity who had lead a band of demons in gang-raping Eve (Apocryphon of John). Many referred to the Holy Spirit as the great Whore, who had prostituted herself to matter and had to be redeemed by the cosmic Jesus (this was the doctrine of Simon Magus, for example). Others practiced orgiastic sexual rites along with secret occult rituals (like the Ophites). Many believed that Jesus was the serpent in the Garden of Eden, and that he had to trick Adam in order to free him from the tyranny of "God" (that's the Ophites again).    Modern Gnosticism generally has little or nothing to do with ancient Gnosticism. Most modern Christian Gnostics conveniently embrace a religion of tolerance and love, and base their teachings more on Hinduism than actual Gnosticism. The Gnosticism peddled by Elain Pagels, for example, avoids mentioning the darker side of ancient Gnosticism, and presents everything is a light that is more acceptable to modern readers.|`|u6RHKlMMaa	Gnosticism (Greek: knowledge) refers to a diverse, syncretistic religious movement consisting of various belief systems generally united in the teaching that humans are divine souls trapped in a material world created by an imperfect god, the demiurge, who is frequently identified with the Abrahamic God.|`|dnvjJB0Zaa	Gnostics believe that the god of this universe is evil and that Jesus' mission was to save us from this evil god, not to reconcile us to him as the Christians believe.|`|f3w3x1aOaa	The texts states(possibly) that Jesus was married and had a daughter named sara.  biblical scholars try to state this but there's no proof, not even in the texts.  In another text of John it states that Jesus says that he was the serpent.  These texts also says that satan created us in duplication of what the most high god created in heaven.  the texts are very confusing.  i have all of them.  if you keep reading them over and over then you will understand.|`|lR6Ocjm1aa	Quietly Bringing in Destructive Sects    Some Bible scholars are of the opinion that in Pauls first letter to the Corinthians and, more particularly, in his letter to the Ephesians and to the Colossians, he purposely used certain Greek words (such as gnosis, knowledge, and plero.ma, fullness) in order to refute gnosticism. However that may be, Paul was certainly combating apostate ideas that were later developed by the Gnostic sects. The Gnostics, who flourished during the second century C.E., were dualists, believing that all matter is evil and that spirit is good. They held that salvation comes through mystical knowledge (gnosis). Their belief that the fleshly body is evil led them to either of two extremes: asceticism or fleshly indulgence. So-called Christian gnosticism did much to cause the way of the truth to be spoken of abusively.    What did the Gnostics believe, and why did they cause the way of the truth to be spoken of abusively?

AOXyfeQwaa	When John wrote Revelation, Christianity was upwards of 60 years old. At the outset, it had survived 40 years of constant opposition from Judaism. Then the Jewish system received a mortal blow in 70?C.E. when the unrepentant Jews lost their national identity and what was to them virtually an idolthe temple in Jerusalem.    The apostle Paul had foretold that there would be an apostasy among the anointed Christians, and Jesus messages show that in Johns old age this apostasy was already developing. John was the last of those who acted as a restraint on this all-out attempt by Satan to corrupt the seed of the woman. (2?Thessalonians 2:3-12; 2?Peter 2:1-3; 2?John?7-11) So it was the appropriate time for Jehovahs Chief Shepherd to write to the elders in the congregations, warning of developing trends and encouraging righthearted ones to stand firm for righteousness.     How the congregations in 96?C.E. responded to Jesus messages we do not know. But we do know that the apostasy developed rapidly after Johns death. Christians ceased to use Jehovahs name and substituted Lord or God for it in Bible manuscripts. By the fourth century, the false doctrine of the Trinity had infiltrated the congregations. During this same period, the idea of an immortal soul was being adopted. Finally, Roman Emperor Constantine gave state approval to the Christian religion, and this led to the development of Christendom, where Church and State joined forces in ruling for a thousand years. It was easy to become a new-style Christian. Whole tribes adjusted their earlier pagan beliefs to versions of this religion. Many of the leaders in Christendom became oppressive political tyrants, enforcing their apostate views by the sword.    Jesus words to the seven congregations were completely ignored by the apostatizing Christians. Jesus had warned the Ephesians to regain the love they had at first. (Revelation 2:4) Nevertheless, members of Christendom, no longer being united in love for Jehovah, fought vicious wars and persecuted one another horribly. (1?John 4:20) Jesus had warned the congregation in Pergamum against sectarianism. Yet, sects appeared even in the second century, and today Christendom has thousands of squabbling sects and religions.Revelation 2:15.    Jesus had warned the Sardis congregation against being spiritually dead. (Revelation 3:1) Like those in Sardis, professed Christians quickly forgot about Christian works and soon delegated the highly important work of preaching to a small, paid clergy class. Jesus had warned the congregation in Thyatira against idolatry and fornication. (Revelation 2:20) Yet, Christendom openly sanctioned the use of images, as well as the promoting of the more subtle idolatry of nationalism and materialism. And immorality, while sometimes preached against, has always been widely tolerated.    Jesus words to the seven congregations expose the total failure of all of Christendoms religions to be Jehovahs special people.  The clergy of Christendom have been the most prominent members of Satans seed. Speaking of these as the lawless one, the apostle Paul foretold that their presence is according to the operation of Satan with every powerful work and lying signs and portents and with every unrighteous deception.2?Thessalonians 2:9,?10.     While claiming to be shepherds of the flock of God, Christendoms leaders, religious and secular, showed special hatred for anyone who tried to encourage Bible reading or anyone who exposed their unscriptural practices. John Hus and Bible translator William Tyndale were persecuted and martyred. During the bedarkened Middle Ages, apostate rule reached a peak in the diabolic Catholic Inquisition. Any who disputed the teachings or authority of the church were unmercifully suppressed, and countless thousands of so-called heretics were tortured to death or burned at the stake. Thus Satan endeavored to ensure that any true seed of Gods womanlike organization would be quickly crushed. When the Protestant rebellion, or Reformation, occurred (from 1517 onward), many Protestant churches manifested a similar intolerant spirit. They too became bloodguilty by martyring those who endeavored to be loyal to God and Christ. Truly, the blood of holy ones was freely poured out!Revelation 16:6; compare Matthew 23:33-36.    http://www.watchtower.org/e/200704b/arti...|`|wxBFZ41Taa	The sect that "won" so to speak, was the true Church, just as Christ promised. He said there would be apostasies, but that the gates of hell would not prevail against his Church.    2000 years later, his Church is still one, holy, catholic and apostolic. A true miracle. Awesome.    If you read the writings of the early Christians, you will see that the early Church was decidedly Catholic in practice and belief, even before the Roman Empire was ever involved.    http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/  http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.ht...|`|axT0Gl0haa	Catholicism is not Christianity.     Jesus said the gates of hell wouldn't prevail against His church, and the Bible defines the church as the physical bodies of saved believers, NOT any organization.     Jesus didn't mean that the church would prevail by physical war and murder.  That is a gross twisting of His words.      Catholicism is a counterfeit, and isn't the real thing.      The true church of Jesus Christ, the physical bodies of saved believers, will always exist, no matter who runs the government, even if Islam ran the government and tried to kill every believer.|`|8xJIPeHMaa	These were sects that taught heresy.  The Holy Spirit guided The Church.  Gnosticism-This splinter group, present as early as the second century, denied Jesus' humanity. They believed that all material things, including the human body, were evil and as such if Jesus was from God he could not be fully human. The Gnostics did believe Jesus was divine, however they held that salvation comes through a special mystical knowledge not given to all, but only the elite - the Gnostics. They also adapted some Christian writings, including the Gospel and added to them, which ultimately led to the church adopting a common Cannon of Scripture.  The challenges this group brought to the mainstream church resulted in the writing of a statement of faith, the Apostles Creed, by the year 200 which helped clarify Christian beliefs. Those seeking baptism had to understand and accepted this creed.    Arianism-Around the time of Constantine another heresy arose which ended up dividing the church for centuries. First advocated by an Alexandrian priest named Arius, Arians denied Jesus' divinity. They believed there was only one distinct person in God. Jesus could not be God because he was created by God. Arians held that Christ was in between God and man.    Constantine called the bishops together to discuss this problem that was more prevalent in the East. The Council of Nicaea met in 325, and after much discussion Arianism was condemned as wrong. Arius refused to conform and was declared a heretic. The Nicene Creed (the profession of faith we recite at Mass today) was born at this council meeting to more clearly define Jesus as being both God and human. Belief in this creed has been a defining point in Christianity now for more than sixteen hundred years. Many excommunicated Arians converted numerous Barbarian tribes, which resulted in this heresy raging well into the seventh century.    Manichaeism-This group, popular in the 300's, believed that there were two Gods. One god created good, the other created evil and therefore no one was held accountable for his/her sins. St. Augustine became a Manichaean before converting to Christianity.    Donatism-Also existing in the 300's was this group, which believed that the validity of sacraments depended on the moral character of the priest or bishop who administered them. Arising after a bishop was appointed who had denied the faith during persecutions, this sect selected it's own Bishop, Donatus. They held that those who denied the faith during the persecutions could not be forgiven for such a grave sin. Gradually through St. Augustine's influence this movement died out.    Pelagianism- A British monk, Pelagius, propagated another group attacked by St. Augustine. Pelagians professed that a person could get to heaven without God's help - without the help we call grace. They believed one could be saved by one's own free will, by working hard enough.    These groups were very heretical in their beliefs and that is why they died out.  The gates of hell prevailed against them and Gods will "won the war".  And is still winning the war.  Although there is much more Heresy in the world today.  Look around at the overwhelming splinter groups of christianity and its easy to see who is dividing the church.      CJ, I love you brother, but it seems like you have alot of hate inside.  Why would you lash out in such an hurtful way to other christians.  If The Catholic Church is not christianity,  then where were all the christians for 1450 years or so.  Did God hide the truth from the world for such a long time only to reveal it again at such a late date.  Did all those souls from 33ad to 1450ad just have bad luck...die and go to hell.  What was the purpose of the cross then?  God's truth cannot be hidden.

"For I came to cause division, with a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a young wife against her mother-in-law.      "Indeed, a mans enemies will be persons of his *own* household." --Matthew 10:34-36    "You originate with God, little children, and you have conquered those [persons], because he that is in union with you is greater than he that is in union with the world.      "They originate with the world; that is why they speak [what proceeds] from the world and the world listens to them.       ". . . He that does not originate with God does not listen to us.     "This is how we take note of the inspired expression of truth and the inspired expression of error." --1 John 4:5    . . . I well know that *You do not have the love of God in You*. . . --John 5:39-44    "If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.  If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now *because you are no part of the world*, but *I have chosen you out of the world*, on this account the world hates you.  Bear in mind . . ,  A slave is not greater than his master.  If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also." --John 15:18-25    "Now the works of the flesh are manifest, and they are fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct,  idolatry, practice of spiritism, *enmities*, *strife*, jealousy, *fits of anger*, *contentions*, divisions, sects,  envies, drunken bouts, revelries, *and things like these*.

LOL!  Just Kidding.    Every belief out there says that a messiah of another belief is a false prophet.    During the inquisition, the Jewish were tortured and killed for their beliefs that Moses was their prophet.    Those who believe in Allah are touted as being wrong because of their belief in Allah and that Mohammad is their prophet.     There are times when Christian's were persecuted for their beliefs with Jesus as their prophet.    Pick a belief and there is someone who will say they are wrong and that their prophet or leader is the Antichrist or some other evil person.  One day that person will lead to the end of the world, well personally, I'll wait till the end of the world to see who's right.    Either way, I'll be spending my time with Buddha, Dalai Lama, and other intelligent people in the afterlife, whatever it may be.

He fits none of the characteristics other than that he claimed to be a prophet. Besides that, you yourself can ask God and know who Joseph Smith is/was, if you have any kind of a personal relationship with God that is.     The false prophet will force all to follow or be killed. He will take away their freedom to worship. There will be hard punishments if they resist.    JS said:  "We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may."    Declaring "one true religion" is what Jesus Christ himself did so that alone cannot pinpoint a false prophet.    All true prophets that belong to him have done it.   It's the force and the bloodshed for not following that is most evil.  Jesus said that HIS gospel should be preached meek and mild and "harmless as doves". People who reject it are to be left. Nothing else. No harming done.    Everyone has their own end-time and so energy would be better spent getting to know God on a personal level and find out where he wants you and what he wants from you.        |`|KRdA9iS2aa	Antichrist's against or instead of Christ. The term applies to all who deny what the Bible says about Jesus Christ, all who oppose his Kingdom(organization or group). and all who mistreat his followers, It also includes individuals, organizations,and nations that falsely claim to represent Christ or that improperly ascribe to themselves the role of Messiah. to know them? read Matthew7:21"Not everyone who calls me Lord,Lord will enter the Kingdom of God..". Everybody pray to him.but not all.. 1John2:18"young children, its is the last hour(near end)and, just as you have heard that Antichrist is coming, even now there have come to be many Antichrists..:notice that the "many Antichrists" of 1Jn2:18 here referred to collectively as antichrist."

There is no such scripture in the Bible.    According to John 2:22, an antichrist is someone who denies the father and the son.  It doesn't say anything about claiming to be the one true church.    In John 2:18, we learn that antichrist is plural - there were and will be many who deny the father and the son.    2 Thessalonians 2 talks about the man of sin, but does not use the word antichrist.  The man of sin is identified as Satan, who comes with "signs, wonders, and lying wonders."  Satan is the one who sits in the temple of God and pretends to be God.

Now your asking not for scripture but how we will know unless we read it?    Well here is a few. Since Walking by the spirit will produce or at least the believer should show forth results of living by the spirit here are some of the qualities.    Galatians 5:22  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith.    This is in contrast to what a non- believer would show or a believer who is not walking by the spirit. those are here.    Galatians 5:19  ? Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness,  20 idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies,  21 envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like...    Now Paul's exhortation to Timothy was.    1Timothy 6:11  ? But you, O man of God, flee these things (love of money) and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness.    then Paul states some if his qualities.    2Timothy 3:10  ?But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance,    (Paul's faith, longsuffering, love and perseverance (enduring patience)    Believers should not have fear    2Timothy 1:7  For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.     Some of the qualities Peter writes about in  2Peter 1:5-11    goodness, knowledge, self-control and perseverance and brotherly love.    I would venture to say that Jesus Christ manifested all of the above qualities. Though it would be good to document them.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Compassionate Action and to also love the 'Brothers and Sisters' out there.

The thing about the abortion issue is that it's not really a religious issue, the way we talk about it, it's a political issue.  And in politics, you try to frame the issue by the words you use to talk about it.  If conservatives and the Religious Right can frame the issue being about 'killing babies' they can win more votes.  But not everyone believes that early-term abortion is 'killing a baby'.    It's the same with 'pro abortion'.  Some Christians say that women use abortion as a primary means of birth control, or that the only reason it's legal is that 'abortionists', doctors who care for women, make money doing it.  Some seriously believe this, others deliberately mischaracterize their opponent's position, something else very common in politics.    During the Clinton administration, abortions went down by 50% or more, because the administration did what it could to make birth control available to young women.  When Bush came to office, the number of abortions went right back up to where it had been before.|`|AsyB1qLyaa	If you think it is the woman's right to have an abortion, then you must think that abortions are okay. |`|1a09fa136e7665ab959724ed81d7230eaa	You are probably also pro-choice when it comes to a person's right to treat cancer.

There are many pro-choice people who believe that abortion is murder. The law, as of right now, states that a mother has the right to murder her unborn child therefore that gives her the right to choose.    Pro-abortionists dislike the word murder and therefore go out of the way to dehumanize the unborn baby. When this is done, it makes the murder more inconsequential giving the mother the right to say "my rights are being violated" and "it's my body I'll do what I want" attitudes.    So, some of us pro-choice believers say fine...murder your baby -- whether you believe it or not, you WILL answer for it sooner or later on judgment day...it's YOUR choice.             |`|2Hot9EJiaa	There are certain things that are absolutes- and abortion is absolutely taking the life of a baby in the womb.

houWY7qvaa	No, I don't believe any Bible should be discontinued or destroyed.  Understanding the various words used, their meanings, play an important part in understanding the scriptures if you are willing to look for them.  .  All versions of the bible were re-written in the era, time frame, and language of the people who wanted them.  Original writings were in languages that most of us today do not speak.  Sheol is Hebrew for "the common grave''  So if you were to die, you would simply be buried.  The KJV uses hell instead of the original sheol or hades because it means the same thing only interpreted different.  That's why there is so much confusion over everyone beliefs.  Hell in the KJV is used to describe a fiery torment which if was read in context would mean something entirely different.   A lot of people or religions rely on a single verse from the scriptures to make a point, when the whole entire book is meant to be read, in whole for understanding, so there is no question of what is true or misinterpreted.  That entirely rids one of confusion and contradiction.  To destroy the Holy Scriptures would not make a difference in the minds of those who will not seek the why's and wherefore's of a single word that can change the course of ones beliefs.|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	none are correct    if you want correct, read the original hebrew without any greek additions|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no....diff ways of saying the same thing....    many ppl like RSV and NRSV|`|LfDdILp8aa	if you are saved ..i say whichever GOD leads you to read.|`|lR6Ocjm1aa	New International Version  Sheol-Hebrew grave  Hell-Greek Grave  |`|CjRfJbncaa	Sheol (Hebrew), and, hades (Greek),   *both* mean: 'The common grave of humankind'.

O3WYA3WGaa	Just search the word "fornicator" or "fornication" in the NT on http://bibleontheweb.com    No, you should only have sex after you've gotten married.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	No, premarital sex is a sin in the Bible. That covers ANY sex before marriage. It is called "fornication" in the Bible.  Hebrews 13:6 and l Corinthians 7 talk about this subject and concerning marriage between the husband and wife, and the unmarried and widows.|`|M5XjqI40aa	Yes because you are in love and planning on getting married.|`|AA10043552	The Bible does NOT forbid sex before marriage.    That's just what the priesthood tells you to keep you in line.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I think you already know that the bible says sex is for marriage only.|`|M6VcuiyDaa	So you're only allowed to have sex once you've signed your name on a piece of paper?|`|zZxX5PXBaa	engagement in the modern world is not really very similar to betrothal in the OT or NT world. betrothal was much closer to marriage, and even so, it was not generally acceptable to have sex before the marriage. The assumption in both OT and NT was that there would be no sex before marriage, but how far this is a cultural assumption, and how far it was God's command, is hard to be sure of. The English NT, in many versions, uses words like 'fornication' or 'sexual immorality' but these seem not to refer to a couple who are living faithfully to each other, but to relate to things like sexual promiscuity, prostitution, incest, and so on.    Part of the problem is the marriage. In biblical times, and in most cultures traditionally, marriage is the exchanging of promises, witnessed by the community in which the couple live. It's not about a piece of paper, for instance, it's about a social recognition of these two as an item. Nowadays, it's become primarily a family event, and secondarily a materially based celebration or act of conspicuous consumption; neither of these is particularly biblical. Modern trends like jetting off to a Caribbean resort and having some hired minister 'marry' the couple on the beach at sunset may reflect modern notions of romance, but have nothing to do with either biblical values, or traditional conceptions of marriage in most cultures.    There are plenty of examples, biblically, of intimacy preceding the 'contractual' bit. Taking someone to wife was much, much simpler (just as divorce was much simpler) as with David taking Nabal's wife for himself in 1 Sam 25, or as with Ruth lying with Boaz, under the same blanket, in Ruth chapter 3 (and most scholars reckon the text implies she did much more than share his blanket).    I would say that what Jesus has to say in the New Testament, in pardoning the woman taken in adultery, for instance, is that sexual sins are not the most serious. In most fo the world, the church makes them out to be THE most serious sins, and says very little about sins of pride or materialism (the kind of sins that modern weddings virtually celebrate).    I think that if you find you've 'gone too far' you need to realise that God made  you both to want sex, and will be incredibly understanding if you have gone further than is wise (wise in the sense of, for instance, w hat happens if you get pregnant) and you must absolutely not see this as any sort of unforgivable sin.    I think if you want to do the right thing, you may find that in fact, the right thing is to take a stand for biblical values, about stewardship of money, about pride, about deciding whether to lay your emphasis on the exterior or interior (try squaring an expensive wedding dress with 1 Peter 3 vv. 1 to 7, for instance) things. That might mean radically shortening your engagement, radically simplifying the wedding plans, taking a strong stand against wedding presents that represent conspicuous consumption, and so on. If God wants the two of you together, just get on with it, as simply and straightforwardly as you can. I firmly believe God is against long engagements. They are done for thoroughly bad reasons and put ludicrous temptations in the way of the couple.    The problem here, though, is not to look for 'proof texts' either way. Don't do that, because people will fire them in both directions. If you want to do the right thing in thinking it through, research biblical marriage, do some basic theological thinking about whether you follow the secular models your culture offers, or follow Christ and do what is different, what represents the values of the Kingdom. There is no shortcut to that.    The man who counselled me when I became a Christian, sadly long dead, used to say on matters relating to boyfriends / girlfriends / engagements and associated matters of guidance. 'Pray abotu it for a year, and then make up your mind'. That wasn't to introduce a years' delay, but because he also beleived that any evangelical Christian should be reading through the whole of scripture every year, cover to cover, adn that as you do that, the concerns of your heart are exposed to the full counsel of scripture, and that is how you make good decisions. But if you've made your decision about marriage, my advice is, marry as soon as you possibly can, because if God wants the two of you together, that is the right thing, and everythign else is a compromise. God bless the both of you.|`|C5bCr1Bhaa	Nope. you need to wait.|`|CKHzrI7Waa	No. Think it's considered fortification. Most Bibles have a section where you can look things up by alphabet.|`|lfjTRFzFaa	Go on have sex it will do you both good.    Do you really think that God, if he exists, with all the horror and injustice  thats going on in this world, would care about two people who truly love each other doing something wonderous and meaningful and even more binding to and for each other?    Just do it!|`|nBERj16Eaa	According to God's plan, sex is meant to be shared by a married couple.  Anything else is wrong.  (Sadly we are now living in a culture where sex is not "Sacred", but recreational).|`|UHNlngiOaa	sex before marriage is a form of  fornication and adultery. read your bible please. each of these sins react to each other, just because you are engaged does not mean that you can now act as man and wife.|`|Y6YGHsKjaa	No, you need to wait. Sex is meant for marriage only. Engagement is the state before marriage. You have promised your fiance that you will marry them. That doesn't mean that you will fulfill that promise. I'm not saying that you will, but it isn't marriage. I can't remember/find verses because I am not good at that, but I do know that engagement isn't marriage. It can be hard to wait, but you'll be glad you did. Until you are married, you should remain pure.     I applaud you for wanting and trying to make the right decision.
vMAEeh66aa	"If ye help him not, still Allah helped him when those who disbelieve drove him forth, the second of two; when they two were in the cave, when he said unto his comrade: Grieve not. Lo!

Even if bad things happen.. everything passes through God's hand..     I thank God for the bad times in my life also, because without it, how else would I know His strength, mercy and grace.    EDIT- God never promised us physical healing.. so to say that God didn't heal the person.. this life isnt' where its at for a christian, the person actuallly got their reward after they pass, if they are a Christian.    Gods will is that all come to know Him, His will for our lives is that we share the gospel to others.

And all Human wisdom is Godly also - so why must there be a distinction?    Perhaps these sayings are referring to the pain of experience that must be lived through in order to gain knowledge and wisdom?    Or perhaps the wiser we get, the more we can see, and can no longer escape into blissful ignorance?    When you think on it, animals do not worry about weapons of mass destruction, or bad economies, or crime, or war. All that they really need be concerned about is catching their next meal.     Humans have learned to look further ahead, to gather knowledge, to develop wisdom, and it seems the more they learn, the more they have to worry about.
bVLWVonUaa	Maybe your just more naturally talented at it and remembered it better. Spanish was my first language too, and I'm also Mexican-American.  However, when I started school I eventually sort of lost some of my ability and began to prefer English more. Because when you think about it, this is America and its mostly dominated by English.  Like for example, I wake up at six and I turn on the radio and I listen to a talk show in ENGLISH. Then, I go to the car and my mom drops me up at the train station and in the car I listen to that talk show there too. In the train, I read the newspaper in ENGLISH. Then, at school from eight to three-thirty, I speak and listen to ENGLISH. In extra curriculars after school, they are also in English.  Then, when I get home and check my e-mail and read the news, its mostly in ENGLISH. Then, when I do my homework for about three hours or so, its all in ENGLISH. And when I read books for fun, its pretty much mainly in ENGLISH. So thats pretty much why I like and speak English better, lol.  But I mean, I totally get where you are coming from, these days a lot of people seem to have totally forgotten their heritage and can't really speak Spanish anymore. I mainly speak Spanish with my parents, and I also go to church sort of, more like religious meetings, three times a week and they are conducted completely in Spanish, which is helpful. But besides these things, I don't really get a lot of opportunities to speak Spanish. I mean, I can understand it perfectly, the thing that I have problem is speaking it. Like when I speak it, I can't seem to remember the proper words to use. Don't get me wrong, I can speak it very well, but there are certain things that I can't do with it. Like right now I wouldn't be able to conduct a scientific lecture in Spanish, nor would I be able to talk slang with some Mexican natives or anything. I can read and write it though quite efficiently, but that is mostly due to my religious meetings.    Mostly I have to say that either those kids are too lazy, aren't interested in attempting to learn Spanish,or are just too preoccupied with the English world to bother. It can also be pretty difficult to do so here where English is such an important part of our society. But I think that its mostly where you live. My school is only like twenty percent or fifteen percent hispanic, but the kids who are hispanic totally speak Spanish all the time, or are constantly peppering some Spanish words in when they speak English. I however, don't really speak it naturally that much, and I think that it might have to do with the environment that I grew up in. I grew up in a white neighborhood and I am mostly used to hearing Polish on a daily basis than Spanish in my neighborhood. But I mean, Spanish is by far not the worst I've seen. No offense, but the Italians in my neighborhood are the worst in my opinion. The Italian kids can't speak it AT ALL. The Polish kids in my neighborhood are the best ones with keeping their heritage though, they constantly jabber away fluenty in it. But I mean, I'm not dissing the Italians or anything. I'm sure that they're not like that everywhere. You have to realize that my neighborhood is mainly Polish, Italian, and Irish. And since the Irish speak English, I obviously have a very small amount of races to derive from.  So anyways, what I'm basically getting at is I think its mostly where you are from in particular. In addition, I think that it can be quite difficult to maintain your heritage in our English culture, but nonetheless, you are right and the effort to do so should be done. But there is proof that its not always this way. Did you know that Hispanic teenage girls are most likely to attempt to commit suicide, and this is attributed to the fact that they seem to grow the most lonely and long after their native country and culture? In MY opinion, I still think that hispanics are extremely close to their culture. In the food, language, customs, and everything. I mean c'mon. In most Mexican households at least, you are bombarded in your daily life with tacos, Spanish words, quinceneras, pinatas, etc.|`|SdHqyWKHaa	Sociologically speaking, the common pattern is that the first generation in a new country speaks little or none of the new language, the second generation is bi-lingual, and the third generation speaks little of the original language. However, if the first generation is already bi-lingual, it's the second generation that tends to speak little of the original language. At some level, bi-lingualism takes extra time and energy, and if it's not strictly necessary, it tends not to be done. This holds for Japanese, Irish, German, Russian, etc., immigrants, as well as for Hispanics.  Language is only one element in a culture, and customs and traditions often continue even if the language changes. The culture here that they grew up in is just as much 'where they came from' as their ancestral culture is.|`|lIQhB56Oaa	I know a TON of hispanics that don't speak spanish but are completely in touch with their culture and make sure everybody knows where they come from.

The Creator and The Sustainer of all these Creatures is One only; if there were more than one there would have been confusion in the heavens and the earth! That One is Allah (the only true God).    Can we find an explanation of the great universe? Is there any convincing interpretation of the secret of existence? We realize that no family can function properly without a responsible head, that no city can prosperously exist without sound administration, and that no state can survive without a leader of some kind. We also realize that nothing comes into being on its own. Moreover, we observe that the universe exists and functions in the most orderly manner, and that it has survived for hundreds of thousands of years. Can we, then, say that all this is accidental and haphazard? Can we attribute the existence of man and the whole world to mere chance.              In the world then there must be a Great Force in action to keep everything in order. In the beautiful nature there must be a Great Creator who creates the most charming pieces of art and produces everything for a special purpose in life. The deeply enlightened people recognize this creator and call him Allah 'God'. He is not human because no human can create or make another human. He is not an animal nor is He a plant. He is neither an idol nor is He a statue of any kind because none of these things can make itself or create anything else. He is different from all of these things, because He is the maker and keeper of them all. The maker of anything must be different from and greater than the things which he makes.      Imagine yourself in an aeroplane and you know it is   going to crash...     Who do you turn to for help then ?     Or on a ship in the sea, thrown helplessly up and down   by towering waves ...     There will have been a situation at one time or the   other in your life when you called upon your Creator   alone, forgetting everyone and everything else,   hoping, trusting, wishing that the Being you know in   your heart and soul that has power and control over all   things would help you. The only One you know can   save you!        Scientists, even though they are able to reproduce human and animal life through artificial processes like in-vitro fertilization and cloning, cannot accomplish these feats without the basic elements of human life that consist of genes and cells and other organic properties. Scientists are not able to create these things. Even the processes that are used by scientists to accomplish various procedures originated from a source whose intellect was obviously far greater than those who seek to discover and imitate the creative processes.    There are various ways to know God "Allah", and there are many things to tell about Him. The great wonders and impressive marvels of the world are like open books in which we can read about Allah. Besides, Allah Himself comes to our aid through the many messengers and revelations He has sent down to man. These messengers and revelations tell us about everything we need to know about Allah.|`|AA11969451	Depends on which version of God you are referring to. Yes, I do believe in God. I do not believe in the Christian concept of God.

There is no reason to believe in any god.  If there were the SLIGHTEST bit of evidence, then perhaps there would be a reason, but there is no evidence.    Anyway, scientific theories explain the world 1000 times better...|`|AA10686855	I do. I used to be addicted to drugs and alcohol. I existed in a very dark way. I was depressed. I hated my life and wanted to die. All I could see of this world was wicked and evil. One day, my mind grasped the concept of Jesus Christ, God's love for me, and his mercy toward me. No matter how badly I have ever behaved, I am forgiven. I finally realized that my way of doing things (the ways of this world), was the problem all along. Once I began to do things God's way, I could see and feel the positive changes taking place. The changes didn't happen over night and I'm far from perfect (believe that), but learning about Jesus and believing in him and what he did for you and me has definately brought about changes in my life that has proven to me that God certainly does exist and he loves us all. All good things come from God and all bad things are a result of not choosing to acknowledge and accept His way (Jesus Christ). Choose to be blessed, choose Jesus, trust God. He is real.|`|5bf9b8d43814dc2a572dcd9ef1a006cbaa	yes beacuse of the personal epeirences i've had with him|`|5f762e39a8301486941ff982e016127caa	Mabe god .CERTAINLY NOT RELIGION.|`|68450de3dba7bce8ff0931461b8050bfaa	Yes,I do.All of the evidence of creation points to him.His inspired word,The King James Version further proves it.God bless you-Kathy|`|555772fda577f8a6087c97a73e54c906aa	Yes.. . because of my own peronal daily life experiences|`|a6a854252a0f4626d093d4da1d03b988aa	yes he is real.|`|75ddf577d2298cff1b5d6183445b7993aa	No. not the christian god.I believe there are many gods. And i do believe that because if there is a god, it is unlikely that there would be only one.|`|824afc193d18fc352f7246d4c77ad412aa	Yes, for a lot of reasons.  To start with, everything in the world, from life itself, nature, and everything that exists, is too complex to have just happened by accident.  Also because God has helped me through so much, things that I could never have managed on my own.  He's put people in my life who have done more than I ever could have imagined.  I still struggle, but with God in my life, I can make it.
nZdyaxhGaa	A few things... actually.  Being at shows. Hellrock/industrial shows, namely. I just lose myself in the vibrations. It's the only time I can be around a lot of people that I don't feel claustrophobic around them.  Then there's during and after sex with my fiance. Euphoria overtakes me. There's nothing outside of us. F* everyone else. They don't matter. Just living out the only life we're good at.  And the third is... driving at three a.m. where there's no one in sight, blaring music loud, smoking a cigarette, going either way to fast, or way too slow.|`|d11beb9dbe4d078345e0f4632d56c6d9aa	Spending time with my grand children is the absolute best.

I personally believe that it is OK to be "hard" on an issue, or whatever it is a person says, as long as you're "soft" with the person.    Sometimes the line is crossed, sometimes people are overly-sensitive, and then there are those who set out to inflict as much damage as they can.    These are the ones who are lions behind their keyboards. Discussion boards and question and answer forums provide a means for these people to vent the anger and the hatred that's bottled up inside of them.    I don't think joy even enters the equation ~ I thinks its more of a satisfaction of being able to lash out at what they hate. |`|s7pqFa1eaa	In my case, it is because I don't get enough chance to punch people in the face.|`|00B394HBaa	On Yahoo...they're a nasty troll who should be squished!!!!

C8gLsP3Taa	YES   YES   YES  and there is a guaranteed way to get there and not only that, the price has already been paid for.     Because we have sinned we are born separated from God.  Without intervention, we are ineligible for Heaven.  This applies to the entire human race.  You are not alone.     Romans 3:23 says, "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"     Romans 3:10 says, "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"     Romans 6:23a "For the wages of sin is death;"     Revelation 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone:"     There is no amount of good works we can do to save ourselves from being eternally separated from God.     Ephesians 2:8-9 say, "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."     To be separated from God forever, simply do nothing.  To ignore or reject God's son is the only sin that can keep a person out of Heaven and the only alternative to Heaven is eternal torment in the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:15, 2 Thes. 1:7-9).       John 3:18 "He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."     But there is good news!     There is a simple and free way to be reconciled with God made possible by God's only son Jesus.  A blood sacrifice was needed to pay for your sins and Jesus was sent to become that sacrifice.  He was nailed to a Roman cross to shed His blood in payment for your sin.  Then three days after His death, He rose from the dead, validating once and for all His qualification to be our only Savior.       Placing your complete trust in Jesus' death, burial and resurrection is God's one and only means of reaching Heaven.     Jesus said (John 14:6), "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life:, no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."     John 3:16 & 17 are clear. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved."     The Bible clearly tells us how to be saved:     Romans 10:9-10 "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."     This is a free gift from God because He loves you.     Romans 6:23b "but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."     Romans 10:13 "Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."     Are you ready to believe right now?  Are you ready to be gauaranteed a home in heaven with Jesus Christ right now?    Not only are you guaranteed but you will be forever and ever with Jesus Christ  and all who have their names written in the Lambs Book of Life. |`|G7JL6HHgaa	i don't wanna spend my eternal life in hell...    |`|mggll8dRaa	There is no One That Could Make That Guarantee, Unfortunately...!!|`|iVv6bFW2aa	I might go along for the ride.But if I didn't like it there I would want a return ticket.|`|lU5mdniUaa	guaranteed is spelled wrong so until you get the spelling correct i will have to say no God is Omnipotent and spelling matters to him and me also. heaven can wait spelling is for the now.  |`|iUQezshOaa	In this world, this plane of existence, nothing is guaranteed.    The one sure way to get to heaven is to have Faith and Trust in God. Yes, I'm glad to know that.    Your answers & questions are not hidden, by the way.|`|q3KCDrMAaa	No. Because when you are dealing with the Fairy Tale Bible God Guy, there is going to be some kind of catch. 
C8gLsP3Taa	Yes i would love to know and there is a way to get to heaven already if only we wish to know.    Because we have sinned we are born separated from God.  Without intervention, we are ineligible for Heaven.  This applies to the entire human race.  You are not alone.     Romans 3:23 says, "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"     Romans 3:10 says, "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"     Romans 6:23a "For the wages of sin is death;"     Revelation 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone:"     There is no amount of good works we can do to save ourselves from being eternally separated from God.     Ephesians 2:8-9 say, "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."     To be separated from God forever, simply do nothing.  To ignore or reject God's son is the only sin that can keep a person out of Heaven and the only alternative to Heaven is eternal torment in the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:15, 2 Thes. 1:7-9).       John 3:18 "He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."     But there is good news!     There is a simple and free way to be reconciled with God made possible by God's only son Jesus.  A blood sacrifice was needed to pay for your sins and Jesus was sent to become that sacrifice.  He was nailed to a Roman cross to shed His blood in payment for your sin.  Then three days after His death, He rose from the dead, validating once and for all His qualification to be our only Savior.       Placing your complete trust in Jesus' death, burial and resurrection is God's one and only means of reaching Heaven.     Jesus said (John 14:6), "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life:, no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."     John 3:16 & 17 are clear. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved."     The Bible clearly tells us how to be saved:     Romans 10:9-10 "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."     This is a free gift from God because He loves you.     Romans 6:23b "but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."     Romans 10:13 "Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."     Are you ready to believe right now?  Are you ready to accept the free gift and have a home in Heaven?|`|M2UWOTAjaa	I'm not interested in Heaven - too many holier - than - thou Christians.

In John 3:3-5 the bible says, Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicode'mus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.|`|q6KmVWS1aa	I know without a doubt that there is only one way that is guaranteed to get me into Heaven, and that is Jesus!

QkpNt5mvaa	Your question brought smile to me, thanks April.     Actually, no, it just won't; all for the reason that its 'people' not the 'religious values'.    It's People who can make it a better place. Religion, any religion for that matter guides to be a better person. Christianity has no superiority over Judaism & Islam. Even mythologies like Buddhism and likewise only preaches what is fair.    And, have you forgotten about or is oblivious of the Crusades?|`|skAMYIG6aa	yes:D peace|`|QYqte2Fjaa	No.|`|oX2RZM7xaa	No, it would be hell.|`|a1Bk5pdyaa	NO|`|xcds2eqhaa	you must be f@ king joking right lmao because the day that happens I want someone to kill me-no I will do it myself lmao|`|V90Ao2jfaa	yes if they were genuine but most of the christians I meet just carry the title. |`|yGWVHpF2aa	You have seen the amount Christians fight between their various sects right? It'd be a nightmare!     unless of course everyone was only one denomination..|`|M4ZgVc5kaa	no because everybody would hit somebody for telling them that they were wrong|`|iCxk4zxbaa	Only if every person was a "TRUE" Christian, meaning that they would not fight amongst themselves.  Christians are supposed to love each other as they love themselves, but unfortunately history has proven that is not the case.|`|wjeZmuVNaa	No. lets put some Roman Catholics and Protestants in a room and see if they get along|`|R3X1K01Paa	No. Their is different types of christians i think my r.e. teacher told me. so no doubt they would form an army and then fight so it would not be a better place    (:|`|19JkC34Xaa	Not at all. For example, this section of Y!A would not be nearly as interesting...|`|Cb1qjNehaa	No, the Christian religion is hateful, sexist, hypocrytical, and judgemental. Everything the bible teaches against. |`|7QtYINwFaa	No. Even Christians can't keep the peace all the time. Look at the Dark Ages, the Salem witch hunts, the Crusades, the bloody brawls between Christians and Protestants in the 16th and 17th century. Christians have been here for about 2000 years, yet the world is still as F'd up as always.|`|V6iG16qVaa	no, they already fight over which church is better. |`|cgIOxWNnaa	hell yes , maybe england would be england |`|YlEZKUh4aa	As a matter of fact Earth would not have any sin what so ever!  So yes Earth would be a better place.|`|AA11937917	unlikely.  consider Europe, which at times when it was close to 100 percent Christian it was extremely volatile. Christians even fought and slaughtered other Christians.    While there are many decent Christians (even majorities, usually), there always seems to be a strain of zealots who resort to violence, even when fellow Christians disagree with them (and let's face it, there will never be just one denomination; if there is that too would splinter apart. Human nature).    |`|5hHhTpxAaa	No as a jew how you even suggest that, I believe the world would be better WITHOUT religion in the first place, maybe then we could accept gays and that global warming is real?!|`|YnmOzC3Aaa	This is a hard question to answer. I agree with the man who says diversity is what makes the world. But then a lot of the problems would be handled better I think. In the end it would be impossible to tell, because there would be luke warm mixed with true Christians, I sadly would fall under luke warm. |`|2hpKujaoaa	Nope.  Look at Japan--huge atheist population, virtually no murder.|`|3YLTBfzzaa	No worse. You can't have a better world until you have people stop judging people on arrogant primitive superstitious beliefs. I spent a lot of my life as a Christian and searched between churches looking for what'd make me happy. I was much happier when I left and became agnostic.    Only a world of humble agnostics would be better because we don't want to project a bunch of narrow-minded and prejudiced values on other people. I work with a couple Christians who hate me. It's the piercings, black clothes, industrial music, apparently that makes me an evil satan worshipper. Yeah I'd really want more of that in the world! The only reason I feel strongly about this is because of being harassed by some Christians either in hateful ways, or looking at me like I'm lost or something. How insulting can you be?    Read a good book,  God Is Not Great by Christopher Hitchens|`|GOBfVEHDaa	Wow Great Question! Look at the response!  The truth is Christians have been killing each other for centuries.It's not the religion it's the person behind the religion,besides in the end we all die and our fate is not for us to decide only the way we live with the hand we're dealt.                 Peace|`|Y6lAB3yVaa	If everyone truly followed the spirit of Jesus' words and teachings, whether or not they called themselves Christians, yes, the world would be a better place. If everyone adopted the close-minded dogmas of traditional Christianity, it would be a worse place.|`|jNx2n8hWaa	Watch V for vendetta.  No. it wouldnt    everyone loves god with all their hearts in each of their own religions    most people involved in science based advents are athiests they are driven to work hard because of their athiestic beliefs, they want to find the origin of everything because they do not think there is a God (not all but most) because of them we have new technologies which we can apply to everyday life.    the same culture = clones  there would be no diversity no uniqueness. if you look amongst ur friend circle and pick a people of different religion you will see that who they are, the reason they are your friend is because they have been shaped by their culture, their religion.    religion is nothing but faith. if everyone believed in the same things there would be no zest in life. the world would be a bland place.    the only bad thing with religion is that there are religious extremists and so on causing conflict killing innocent people (including those of tehir own religion) but if all were christians think about what the Church did in the past. dont tell me it will be different if the church takes over now.    not just the church but if any religion takes over the world making it homogenous and monotonous problems would arise.     there is of course the philosophical debate of whether religion breeds morality in people, whether godlessness creates more anarchy, whether it encourages immoral deeds...some people are insipired by their religion to commit less crime....(unfortunately some people more)    all religions believe in one god (christianity, islam, hinduism, buddhism, zorastranism, and so on) who cares which God? its more a personal thing..trying to force everyone to belong ot a particular religion is futile, and not an option- our faith, i.e. what we believe in is what we are.     you might not reach ur full potential with a different eblief system forced upon you. |`|AA11724153	If all were true Christians(following the 10 commandments) surely the world would be a better place. Sadly NONE understand Christianity anymore, Christianity is religion of new age(satya yug) it shall shine forth after this kaliyug. firstly someone needs to teach what really Christ taught and make it understand to the world. |`|H7L66ynJaa	Yes indeed for we would all Love the Lord our God with all our hearts and souls and might and our neighbors as ourselves.|`|mggll8dRaa	Not Necessarily...!!|`|IIhiSprlaa	no.  we'd run around doing stupid things, knowing whatever we do we are forgiven.|`|biPAZ2TVaa	Yes it would. But its not. The better place will be Heaven with all true Christians.|`|OKClYfDQaa	It depends upon the version of Christianity one's in.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	No, because there would be conflicts between different type of Chrisitians. It would be better if the world was composed of Free Thinkers and Atheists|`|PA3pDzjoaa	It would sure be boring.|`|bgtNYOp5aa	No because Right Wing Christians want to control people, tell women what to do with their bodies, tell people what to read, and write and have in the Library, and want prayer in schools.     They don't respect seperation of Church and State. |`|w4LKvr0daa	Not necessarily.    I know plenty of christians who are horrible people. They take the whole forgiveness thing WAY too seriously.      If everyone had decent morals, religious or not, the world would be a better place.|`|N4ZQhklSaa	If every christian actually followed the words of christ it would be. |`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	I doubt it.  What kind of Christian?  Methodist?  Catholic?  Lutheran?  Etc. Etc.  You guys can't even get along with each other.    Now, what if everyone were atheist?  I think then peace might really have a chance.  |`|OYcB4rvraa	It would not be a better place at all! I think that everyone is equal! I dont beleive in anything and i think that is kind of a racist qquestion.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	Smeezle et al is probably right in this, groups would still pit themselves against one another to the point of genocide if everyone was of the "my way or the highway" persuasion.|`|SzqCD0G0aa	Three words for you       WESTBORO BAPTIST CHURCH.      Good luck and take care.|`|O3nYVzSjaa	Without diversity in anything the world falls apart|`|UnlqJgXIaa	Not really, Christians around the world wage war upon each other |`|kQuFzK67aa	Well Europe was all Christian for about a thousand years and that didn't work out so well. It was known as the Dark Ages and was an age where the Church would torture and kill anyone who questioned it, be they Christian or otherwise.|`|Vzf0Zp9Saa	No way.  Everyone would still find some way to hate one another.  It's human nature.  |`|6tVMvbiiaa	A true Christian? Yes.|`|W3LxdNLdaa	yes but it would be the same if everybody was an atheist.|`|oMF6bXCZaa	If Christians followed the teachings of Jesus and ignored the bible, I would yes to this question.

Your Christians are nothing like your Christ."

iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, because many are parasites, and at the same time businesses. It's unfair for regular taxpayers, and it's a violation of separation of Church and State|`|PkBMMvqTaa	They are nonprofit organizations, they receive no money from the government. So, my answer is no.

They get their money from the 10% tax levied upon the people of the church  .  And to tax tax money is kind of hard to explain  .|`|zIiiqNGBaa	Nope. Violation of the first amendment! Separation of Church and State.|`|fOfJz9OMaa	Yes.  Because we as Christians are told by the Word of God to do nothing by partiality (i.e. favortism); and the church overseers at the time this was offered by the secular government should have known this, and declined.  We should render to Caesar the things which are Caesars; and taxes are Caesars.  And even until now this truth is turned away from, and they do not even behold why they should not make themselves chargable, because a recompense was then made, and till this day both the church overseers and the secular state proceed from favor to favor for each other.  Favortism corrupts, it contaminates with sin what should have been a stand for Gods Truth, but now is modified for a favor.|`|681671b8db63cde85f65759dcf0f542caa	yes; especially for those churches that are trying to convince their patrons that Obama is the antichrist|`|PKfh0jhLaa	The state should NOT be in the business of deciding what constitutes a RELIGION.     You see, if you do RELIGION the way that the state likes  you get a big fat juicy tax exemption  and if you do NOT do religion the way the state likes,  you get absolutely NOTHING!    Really what is needed here is to apply the same test that is applied to ALL not-for-profit entities,  very simple, does this club or whatever, actually serve the community?  is it useful?  The CHURCH could provide a base for concerned parents to get their kids out of the public schools and into either HOME SCHOOLING or? but it has potential as long as the individuals involved are willing to put some work into it.    The way that the CHURCH operates right now,  its a tax exempt exclusive club.  and that if anything serves to function as an irritation to the community in general.    Just my $0.02 worth.|`|QAhrXGn3aa	No, in the U.S. we have separation of state and church.|`|RGe6Et0Xaa	If you and your roommate split the rent, should you have to pay extra taxes when you put the money in the same envelope?|`|b4d86f4161f7fd0e73ccc2742d82adeaaa	YES!  Far too many of them illegally stick their noses into politics.  Those who make every effort to stay OUT of politics should enjoy tax-free status, along with all other organizations, atheist and otherwise, related to beliefs.      As long as God is advertised on our money, groups who claim him should have to pay for that service.  NO free government-funded advertising!|`|EIFX90WRaa	I would say yes.  They should be vocal about politics as well and have PAC's and lobbyists.  They need a voice in Congress and if the price of that voice is taxes then I say lets have it.|`|zBw8qrASaa	the catholic church should be i have never seen them help out 1 parishoner that contributes to the up keep of the church and it brings in much money. Did u ever see the cars the priests drives? wow! unbelievable the people help them and they can't help the people...amazing|`|IYe1TTwYaa	Only if they start taxing Planned Parenthood.|`|UgBBdmclaa	should you be taxed because of your foolish hair?.. no!|`|3aBz8pVvaa	Have you noticed? many churches get too involved with politics, I guess those should be taxed since they get also a chunk from the campaign.|`|Zy4Sy2LMaa	If they want to   .  Try and see what would happen next election day  .|`|mggll8dRaa	Some Should Be Taxed; there are 'Churches' in Big U.S. Cities, that look more like "Hot Dog Stands" than anything resembling a Church....!!|`|OKClYfDQaa	Yes.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	No, separation of Church and State.  Goes both ways you know.    However, we must obey the law of the land.  So, if they taxed all Non-Profit organizations it would be fair.  No exemptions across the board.  Now who would still give to a charity if they received no benefit?|`|pGf4mIw9aa	If they are running their church like a business yes.|`|AA12038658	If they are politically active, yes.

Armored Saint's answer is typical of brain dead Jump for Jesus fools; the Bible mentions saints all over the place, and if people saw them after their deaths (saints have made many appearances), what has this got to do with being saved by Jesus? Many of these saints were Jewish. That's right, Jewish. Jews have not been saved by the blood of the tortured and mutilated Lamb, but nevertheless stinking Fundies insist that every word of the Bible came from God. Did you ever notice that there are two distinct accounts of the order of creation in the first chapter of Genesis? Did you ever notice that Jesus has two separate genealogies?  No one can understand either the Old or New Testaments without knowing something about the history of the Jews and the culture of the time.

It is understood as a sort of life force body or aura that constitutes the "blueprint" of the physical body, and which sustains the physical body.    Shadow people are also known as dark shadows or shadow ghosts, and probably are the most misunderstood of entities seen.  Shadow is indication of spiritual condition, and is the absence of light or truth.  In other words, shadow people are disembodied humans who are lost, having not gone forward in lifes journey by refusing to go toward the light after the death of the physical body.     You also have a Spirit Guide which has been with you from the time you was born till the day you pass over : )    Do you also know that people that Astral Travel are seen as ghost, so maybe people think they are seeing ghost, maybe they are just living people just exploring via Astral travelling : )    Food for thought isn't it ?    Nothing in life is to be feared, It is only to be understood.    Love & Blessings  *^v^*Milly*^v^*

Bh6NwFzeaa	Bad behavior starts at home when we are children. Some of us are abused. Physically, emotional, And even sexually. Some people can get help while other people sit around for the rest of their lives. Then the worst part is when they take it out on other people. You can try too help them but they are so full of hate and revenge. They will attack anyone in their way. Some of them become like,"Sybil". They come up with alters to protect themselves. They might have a very smart one that can answer to the smart people. Then they might a tough guy to deal with the bullies. I know someone with 400 avatars. He changes them according to his moods. He can`t fight his own battles so he has different alters to help him out. It`s pretty sad.|`|QkpNt5mvaa	It is 'life experiences' that determine what kind of person we become. As for 'human nature' it is something that very one is given birth on, and is kind of a similar & the same thing for every one. So, it's the Life Experiences that play a great part in somewhat changing that nature.|`|mggll8dRaa	Nature & Nurture are Equally Important in a Healthy Developement of One's "Self"....!!|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You ask the kind of questions people ask when they want an excuse to be terrible.    Let's look at IQ, okay. You find out you have a great IQ. If you were a seeker and using your mind well before, the knowledge doesn't change anything. If you weren't, you become proud and lazy.     The kind of person (good or bad) : If you are good and trying to be better, you find out it's life experience. So what ? You continue. .. But human nature , that anwer gives you an excuse for your vices and drag on your motivationi, and a further problem to deal with when and if you decide to improve.     So, forget the question. Are you good ? Are you trying to be better ? Then just keep going. Where nature is the limitation, it will limit, and where life experience is, you will already be doing what you can. |`|81e525d2b0af9f7090cd857fd7b2095baa	Of course.  People who grow up in rough neighborhoods or surrounded by violence tend to be drawn toward that lifestyle.  |`|EepiLrmZaa	both,. humans are complex. top of the food chain. some things we are born to know. the rest comes from life experience. |`|M2UWOTAjaa	This is the classic nurture vs. nature arugment. It's an old argument, and it is still nowhere near being settled, but the evidence is leaning towards genetics.  Genetic studies have shown that shyness is inherited. Who knew? Studies of identical twins reared separately have been going on for a long time. In one very interesting, twin girls had the same model car, the cars were the same colors, and both boyfriends were named Ken.  If you are born with a part of your brain that is undeveloped genetically, you may well have a partially functioning brain. This seems to be the case with sociopaths. Sociopaths come from every class and every level of education. Some of them are very intelligent, but none of them have any empathy with people. This can be identified in toddlers by the age of 2, something that scares the hell out of many people. Most parents don't want to admit their kid through a baseball through the neighbor's window, never mind that he enjoys torturing cats.  The nurture argument is failing in feminist theory. Infant girls all over the world gravitate towards dolls. Boys gravitate towards things that need to be chased. The lesbians and gays amongst us, it turns out, are born that way. The feminist ideal of the Super Mom who can do everything but fly has been shown to be wrong: Single women don't raise boys well, whether they are straight or lesbian. Boys need a positive role model to pattern their behavior on. Perhaps it doesn't need to be a father, maybe a steady friend or close male relative is enough.  But genes aren't everything. Just because you have the genes of an alcoholic doesn't mean you must become one.|`|OKClYfDQaa	Partly.|`|nFgvIbXqaa	Obviously both Human Nature & Life Experience are contributors.

U8G9X2nlaa	Because my entrance tile and carpet is white, most visitors/guests leave shoes at the door without being asked. Also, we do not wear shoes in our home.For some I have provided guest slippers when I knew in advance. However, I do offer clean or new socks, especially to those few with stinky feet. I see no way to keep new guest slippers in all sizes for all visitors/guests.|`|qfdco4P8aa	Haha. Wow. It is a bit over the top. But I guess it really depends on who is coming over, and what type of "class" you or they are in. When my friends come over, they take their shoes up, but I don't have slippers waiting for them. If their feet are cold they can suck it up, or politely ask for some slippers :)|`|7UagkK77aa	Hello April!    I used to be an investigator for the government in the states, and I had to enter and inspect strangers houses all the time!  We were taught to be mindful of peoples' preferences about shoes in the home, and if unsure, to specifically ask if the person's home was "shoeless" and to remove our shoes if it was.    Usually, if I enter a home and I see a line of shoes by the door and the homeowner has his shoes off, I remove my shoes, too.  I think if your house is "shoeless" most people will realize it, and if not, there is nothing wrong if you invite them to remove their shoes.    Personally, I think slippers is a GREAT idea!  I'm kind of shy about my feet, and I wish I could take house slippers with me whenever I go on visits.  I have a friend that offers me a pair of his thong slippers when I go to his house, and I really appreciate it! :-)|`|OKClYfDQaa	I'll remember that when I get there . . .|`|iVv6bFW2aa	I believe either in taking the shoes off and/or using slippers.

I also make sure I have extra jackets and robes . . . mainly it's just so they can keep warm.|`|47FsMLlwaa	I suppose you must provide your guests with something to cover their odoriferous feet if you are going to require them to take their shoes off.|`|bFC7bboDaa	In Russia you would be tracking snow and slush into a house, if you wore your shoes or boots in.  Here, if you have a shoeless house, you can post a discreet sign on or near the front door requesting your guests to remove their shoes.  You can provide disposable slippers, but most people feel comfortable barefoot.  |`|Dh9gKlsjaa	It is different from household to household.     I suppose if it is cold, it is wise to provide slippers. |`|Ny989FzTaa	I consider it to be "over the top."  Americans typically do not remove their shoes when they enter a residence.

It's actually rather sad.  I'm a teacher and I have students that act out just for the attention.  I usually just tell those kids that if they ever need to talk to come see me and they do.  I think it's horrible that those kids have parents or a parent who can't be bothered with them.

Nothing hostile here, just curious.  I would say reality is eternal. We know that before the Bib Bang occurred there was an impossibly dense concentration of something that was neither matter nor energy, as all atoms were stripped of their particles and presumably their sub particles. We have no idea how long that singularity was there.   The modern cosmological theory of "branes" posits that there is more than one universe. We already know that the universe is shaped like this: ~ If two universes collide, so the hypothesis goes, a third universe results. Since we have no idea of how old these other universes are, I think it's reasonable to assume that reality (existence) is eternal. We know that the universe has edges. The universe exists in space, so it's reasonable to assume that outside the universe space continues to exist. It's mind boggling to think of space that never ends, and equally inconceivable to think that it does. What is beyond it if it does? I've heard physicists say that only mathematics can describe this.

When we speak of "the Millennium," we refer to the 1,000 years following the Savior's Second Coming (see Revelation 20:4; D&C 29:11). During the Millennium, "Christ will reign personally upon the earth" (Articles of Faith 1:10).    The Millennium will be a time of righteousness and peace on the earth. The Lord has revealed that "in that day the enmity of man, and the enmity of beasts, yea, the enmity of all flesh, shall cease" (D&C 101:26; see also Isaiah 11:69). Satan will be "bound, that he shall have no place in the hearts of the children of men" (D&C 45:55; see also Revelation 20:13).     During the Millennium, all people on the earth will be good and just, but many will not have received the fulness of the gospel. Consequently, members of the Church will participate in missionary work.     Members of the Church will also participate in temple work during the Millennium. The Saints will continue to build temples and receive ordinances in behalf of their kindred dead. Guided by revelation, they will prepare records of their ancestors all the way back to Adam and Eve.     Complete righteousness and peace will continue until the end of the 1,000 years, when Satan "shall be loosed for a little season, that he may gather together his armies." The armies of Satan will fight against the hosts of heaven, who will be led by Michael, or Adam. Satan and his followers will be defeated and cast out forever.

It tells us that there will be no more wars between humans ever again - all because Jesus will now be the one and only supreme Ruler of this world.    This verse also tells us that all of God's laws will be going forth from Jerusalem to all of the nations of the world. Jesus Himself will be the One to judge between the nations.    It says that we will no longer "learn war anymore." People will no longer have to be afraid of anyone or anything, and everyone will be able to live safely under his vine and fig tree. It says that our "swords will be beat into plowshares and our spears into pruning hooks."    We will truly have heaven on earth in this environment. It also says that Jesus will teach us all of His ways and we will all learn how to walk in His paths.    Now it shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the Lords house shall be established at the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and peoples shall flow to it. Many nations shall come and say, "Come, and let us go to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; He will teach us His ways, and we shall walk in His paths."    For out of Zion the law shall go forth, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. He shall judge between many peoples, and rebuke strong nations far off; They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore. But everyone shall sit under his vine and under his fig tree. And no one shall make them afraid; for the mouth of the Lord of Hosts has spoken." (Micah 4:1-4)    2.  The reason there will be no more wars is because Jesus will be the only King and Ruler of this world.    This next verse also tells us that there will be no other religions other than God the Father and Jesus Christ. Differences in religions throughout human history have always been the cause of many wars between nations. This next verse tells us that Jesus will reduce to nothing all the gods of this earth and that all peoples shall worship Him and no one else. All of the other "false religions" as we know them today will be forever taken off the face of this world.    "The Lord will be awesome to them, for He will reduce to nothing all the gods of the earth; people shall worship Him, each one from his place, indeed all the shores of the nations." (Zephaniah 2:11 )    3.  This next verse tells us what will happen to a nation or peoples if they do not come up to Jerusalem once a year to worship Jesus as King. It tells us that God will withhold rain from that nation, and you cannot live without the water that rains brings to a country.    "And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles. And it shall be that whichever of the families of the earth do not come up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, on them there will be no rain.   If the family of Egypt will not come up and enter in, they shall have no rain; they shall receive the plague with which the Lord strikes the nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles." (Zechariah 14:16-18 )    Wild Beasts and Wild Animals Will Be Tame  This next verse will tell us that all of the wild beasts and animals on our earth will become tame. It says that lambs will dwell with wolves, calves will dwell with lions and that the lions will eat straw like the ox. Lions and wild beasts apparently will no longer be meat eating beasts and they will no longer have to kill other animals for their food and nourishment!    It also says that poisonous snakes will no longer be poisonous. It says children will be able to play by the vipers den. And if they can do that, poisonous snakes obviously will no longer be poisonous! This verse also tells us that these wild beasts and animals will no longer hurt or destroy.    This incredible verse then ends by saying that the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the seas.    "The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the young goat, the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; ... and the lion shall eat straw like the ox, the nursing child shall play by the cobra's hole, and the weaned child shall put his hand in the viper's den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea." (Isaiah 11:6-9)    You know we are going to have heaven on earth when all of the wild animals and beasts of this earth will be tame. No longer will we have to keep some of these wild beasts and animals locked up in cages in zoos for people to see.    They, like the rest of us, will be totally free from all of the people who li|`|yrpdjzoFaa	It should be far out.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I can't even imagine the beauty of it.

Jhn 17:23 I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.      2Cr 13:11 Finally, brethren, farewell.

We can not be perfect because we are human beings.  We are not God or Jesus.  We aspire to be "Christlike."  That is the best we can do.|`|OKClYfDQaa	It's a mandate.

All else aside, every christian is definitely always one step AWAY from perfect    Because they think something really stupid|`|yHfsHp6naa	I certainly don't; in fact, just the opposite.|`|JVPwpwYlaa	Because you should be perfect before you go around judging others and telling them how to live.|`|WynOhlMZaa	People don't expect Christians to be perfect.

Nobody likes a hypocrit.|`|31addee65693225c68c169daf536009aaa	I think it's because:    1 - sadly, many act as though they are.  2 - many turn zealous and do not follow the example of Jesus and the way he spoke with and approached people.  4 - many Christians show prejudice to people who are different (like having long hair for instance).  They forget that Jesus himself looks at the inside, not at the outside.  3 - people think the Christian life is a set of rules, do's & dont's, and good if you do bad if you don't.  They view it as a life constricted instead of a life of freedom.  Because of their own desire to do and be bad they think people who are trying to live right are being holier than thou.    As a Christian myself, I try to treat everyone equally no matter what they look like, sound like or act like.  I try to remember everyday that I am a representative of Jesus, the living Christ of the Bible. Everyone is a child of God and loved by Him equally no matter what their condition, situation or choices.  This does not mean however that he excuses wrongdoing.  Quite the contrary.  Everyone has free will to choose right from wrong and to choose to live for Christ or themselves.  It is not however my place to judge or bring judgment against anyone.  I am only an offering for Him and a path to Him.|`|612f63e9175a526652c97a470fd55b3faa	Well if they expect it from me they will be very disappointed.

If you've seen this world lately, that's not a difficult feat. People don't think Christians are supposed to be perfect. Only Jesus was perfect. No one else. It's human nature to sin. That's how we're made. If Adam and Eve hadn't sinned first, then there would be no sin. But they did, so Jesus had to save us. If someone said to you, "You're a Christian! Aren't you supposed to be 'perfect'?" They're just guilty about their poor existence of a life and the fact that they don't have a higher power to trust in.    For some of you who've answered, believing in a higher power isn't stupid. If you think there's no God, then I'm sure you'll be suprised when Jesus come again.    |`|IuH76cQTaa	hmm yeah I feel people seem to do so. I agree..    well I guess it's because Christians are the ones who have so many high principles. and yet most of them often don't live with those principles. so it's easy for people to notice that on Christians.

Well, I would go a bit farther than that, and say "at all." I imagine that eternity would grow rather dull after the first couple of eons.

"And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God." (1 John 5:11-13).    To spend eternity with Him Who died for me is what i desire and the only people i know who are happy to say they want to remain on this earth forever are the group from the Watchtower cult who go by the name of Jehovah's witnesses.    How are you going to live on the earth forever when the earth will be burned up at the end times?   2 Pet. 3:10-11 KJV "...the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also... shall be burned up."

I want to go back Home after this lifetime.  We are not this material body, IE; Race, color, nationality, Religion, mind, intellect, senses, job, etc. We are all eternal spirit souls, part and parcel of the Supreme Soul, also known as Krishna, Allah, Jehovah, Vishnu, etc.  We never die, only this mortal body dies. This material world is not our real home, it is called Maya (illusion) and is temporary and full of misery, only one fourth of the souls come here, and the rest are enjoying blissful eternal loving relationships with our Maker named above. We fell here due to envying Gods position.  He made the material world for those who want to try to live separately from Him (Which is impossible because He is actually everywhere).  After many lifetimes of trying to be happy in this temporary world, one becomes frustrated and board and begins to question their existence. We then seek out real happiness, and when one becomes sincere God reveals how to come back Home. Those who are intelligent, take up the process of self realization (Bhakti Yoga), which begins with the chanting of the Maha Mantra, (the great mantra for deliverance from all suffering and illusion), which gives one real peace, happiness and reality. (see my profile for a link for all info on this mantra). Then at the end of life, they can give up all material attachments and fully surrender to God and return to the eternal Kingdom, where there is no more birth, death, old age, or disease and be eternally happy.

It is the choices we as people make which contribute to the bigger picture of what the world is, as more and more people turn towards alcohol and drugs we can see corruption seeding itself in people and yet despite the destruction and negativity alcohol brings people are drawn to it like a moth to light.  We can all make positive choices based on conscience rather than desire.  I think that people who resist the norm live for a long time.  Life comes from resistance to pleasure and selfishness.  I agree that for good people to live forever in this world would seem to be a form of punishment, bad people on the other hand love acting on desire.  
eJMAbtfXaa	good question.  I've wondered that myself, and as yet have not drawn any firm conclusion, but do feel that there may be something to the doctrines of reincarnation, in that great men and women of God will be sent back to accomplish certain tasks etc.  Also, perhaps, people who do not have a successful life, may potentially get another chance to make a mark.      I would not teach nor support this as a doctrine though, unless God revealed it to me either through his word, or divine revelation.  Even then, perhaps I would just keep it on file in the library of my understanding, and not speak about it.|`|mggll8dRaa	I'm Sure About It....!!|`|OKClYfDQaa	Man himself is the living soul - Genesis 2:7.

That is where I can meet all my friends in one place.  We encourage one another.  That is important to me.  We can not continue on alone.  We need our spiritual friends help.  That is why God commands that we do not forsake the gathering of ourselves together.|`|M2UWOTAjaa	Yes. It is the only place I get to meet my friends on a weekly basis.  I wish there were more single women there, but that's not in the cards. I also enjoy the social action things we do, such as helping Amnesty International. |`|6Uohf1h1aa	No but God is.|`|WzsdjtPFaa	 No, it's just a building.  I think the belief should be alot more important.|`|tvSgx9Ogaa	Church's Fried Chicken is|`|avinxtbaaa	Not at all. |`|Lt6Tsauraa	Absolutely.  Without church, it would be impossible for me to get a good table at IHOP before 10AM on Sundays.|`|bzUBiwTYaa	yes it is important to me. Hebrews 10:25 says not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together.|`|bfcb6cf7bc6a85f90f8f096108ab64dbaa	It is vital to my life. The church is actually the people, not the building, and my church has many nice and Christian people in it. They inspire me to live a better life.   |`|AA11923447	Yes. But it's not the be-all and end-all. It's more like a starting point for spiritual exploration. My spirituality doesn't stop at the church door.|`|mggll8dRaa	I Should Be Taking More Advantage of It....!!|`|y2VcJ0t8aa	My church is important to me. Great worship and wonderful teaching. I really enjoy the fellowship.|`|XEBpv9gwaa	Yes, to me personally it is.  
i2M7lyPgaa	There was a man who did,  he worked many years ago on a rail crossing over the Mississippi river.   He raised and lowered a drawbridge for the barges and the on coming trains.   He took his son to work with him one day and at lunch the time got away.  While rushing to put the bridge back so the train could pass, he saw that his son fell into the gear box.  If he put the bridge back his son would be crushed, if he didn't the train with hundreds of passengers would run into the river and kill countless people.    In what had to be a heartrenching decision, he saved the train.    Would I, I really cant say, I hope I am never forced to make that decision. |`|1ehmRBruaa	No. It sounds selfish but blood is thicker than water. I love my children not the strangers on the train. I don't think I could survive without one of my kids.|`|wSPgZokVaa	No, and I can't think of anyone with children who would.|`|0JHi6Rxaaa	Never.     Sorry. My mommy instincts are strong. My social contract with my child says that I am to protect her above all things. My social contract with strangers is to help them when I can at as much cost to myself as I can accept.     I'd expect nothing more from them.       That story is made up anyway. |`|UEIamnh5aa	I hope I never have to be in that situation but I would do it.    I couldn't let a train full of people die just to save my child, all that death.  Think about how many lives I'd be ruining if I did that...all the passenger's friends and family. |`|XaL7cAqNaa	Sorry, no.|`|855c59a2f5f36e537d1ff2087f81910baa	hey Uncle Zebidaih i heard that one once it was on one of those emails saying forward this or die or have bad luck or whatever.  i don't think it's a true story? but correct me if i'm wrong!    anyways, back to the question!  i think we'd all like to think that we would sacrifice the child...but i doubt that many people would.  it's your own flesh and blood, you probably won't have time to consider all the other families whos members will die and so you will act out of instinct.  MAYBE if u had time you would reconsider...but that's a fat maybe, because personally i wouldn't    which is selfish, but human nature|`|KAKXZw0Qaa	 I could not have children -  I might -then be tempted to take my own life.  But it is so hard to say until one is faced with such a horrible choice.  Hopefully never.|`|mggll8dRaa	With Time to Think About It, Very Doubtful...!!|`|iVv6bFW2aa	I don't know it's a very difficult question. I would see what I would do at the moment it occurred.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	I'm sort of ashamed to say it, but I wouldn't sacrifice my pets for a train full of people (I don't have kids).|`|WcxrnINvaa	no, parenthood has very strong protective instincts attached|`|MH8cR5bhaa	No.  without a doubt, No.|`|ybpUb6HCaa	No I wouldn't sacrifice my child to save a train full of people. Not in a million years.     Parental instinct, ya know.|`|GDexucXKaa	No.  MY wonderful, lovable,  genius kid, for a bunch of random people who take the train?  No way.  |`|GGUDvicaaa	I havent  a child and never shall have , but I would never consciously hurt my family members.|`|bf62f6094407e5a99cac76deb119573caa	simply, no.|`|e058c73752697cb2225cc562af0316b3aa	probably not, but I know a story of a man who did just that.|`|6kHQ4jtMaa	i think i would. it would be very hard, and i would be crying on my knees... but i think i would.  i think thats how god felt(well, not exactly) when he sacrificed his son.|`|k4Xg3pI3aa	Not the kind of question one can answer with any certainty until they are presented with the situation. A parent will say 'no'...and who can blame 'em?|`|M2UWOTAjaa	Logic tells me I should, but my heart wouldn't let me do it. The primary purpose of a parent is to provide food, shelter and protection. This is a moral dilemma no one would want to face.|`|MSWgVj4Maa	no, not even a train full of children. Sounds evil but I could not do it.|`|LsWdTDucaa	No.  I simply don't have the same stake in seeing that train full of strangers survive.|`|R21mr14zaa	I was going to say yes - because having kids is extremely selfish.  Then I realised that the train full of people exploding or whatever would do even more to ease overpopulation.  So I'm not sure.  Although, I guess, I am pretty sure I wouldn't have a child to get rid of in the first place.|`|4tJR7Srpaa	no and i dont believe anyone would especially a mother its our instinct to protect our children from harm, you never know what love really is until you have a child|`|ybbhC72Zaa	If I weren't really sacrificing him, but give him a horrible vacation and he would be back by dinner time then most definitely yes.
Q8coTUJfaa	Happy in some senses yes it does, having lots of money is great compared to not(I have been in both situations).    Earning lots of money won't make your life perfect but it will open up a lot of possibilities.|`|OnFstg1Iaa	Did you ever see the movie Richie Rich? Money doesnt buy everything!! If you are depressed and lonely, just because you have money and can buy anything in the world without worrying about a budget and being rich!!!, and even treat your girfriend out to eat everyday!, THAT DOESNT MEAN you will be the happiest person! People may not like you if you have money and think you are a spoiled prep that can afford everything. But it would be nice to have alot of money!|`|fG5dyYSNaa	No I don't. I'm sure it would help me out financially but as for making me happy, never.|`|ZYJ1I9ZNaa	yes it will...because i wont have to worry about who my true friends are because they were my friends before i got rich and i wont have to worry about my bills because ill have a s.h.i.t. load of money for that|`|q5SWb5KZaa	It wouldn't make me happy, it would make my life easier though.|`|3QTa2wFCaa	I don't think I would necessarily be 'happier', but it would definitely take a lot of pressure off. |`|JUe1E0Pkaa	Money doesn't buy Happiness and Love ??    Love and Happiness doesn't buy mansions, luxurious cars, anything you want or dream of.    I rather have alot of money.|`|Rj34Cur3aa	it'd be a big step in the right direction, that's for damned sure.|`|pDptioSNaa	Sure. Playing Shylock is the most fun that can be had :)|`|H9k65Ve0aa	Having a lot of money will make me extremely happy since most of my unhappiness is because I can't give my family what I want them to have, they deserve so much more than I can give to them. Seeing them happy will make me happy.|`|kXhAERt3aa	Sure, at least for a while.      Why don't we test this out - give me some and we'll see how long I can stretch out the good will!|`|f44a573cda18ec9ec6c10faa5842b02faa	Yes, it definitely helps.|`|LHljEdcUaa	HELL YeAH!! of course it would i can buy whatever i like, spend it however i like and most of all help whomever i like. i would use my money to help others, like children and animals especially animals i adore them. i would probably open several non-profit organization for animals and kids. that would be awesome. And what would really be awesome would be going to rich fancy-pansy places and letting all those douche bags business men see a hispanic female spend just as much or more than them... awesome... money would make me happy, i aspire to be an old leather face rich hag thats always drunk surrounded by dogs in my huge ridiculous mansion... thats what i want. |`|ECoyOhzYaa	It won't make you happier, but it will make things better.|`|LsWdTDucaa	All that I ask for is the chance to find out...|`|rGn0MO1Faa	No,but I won't reject donations.|`|VP3bKihBaa	Sure does make it easier. |`|TpHNyMb4aa	No, Happiness comes from with in.  You have to find what makes you happy.  Money just helps make life a little easier.  The more you have the more trouble some get into, some don't know what to do.|`|UCbfcsQsaa	no chance...|`|qgpM1kRRaa	I use to have alot of money and I was miserable.  All I wanted to do was die at that time.  Then I found Jesus!|`|0F8hauikaa	Maybe not, but I'd sure like to find out.|`|6n527pAYaa	Like the man said, "I've been rich and I've been poor -- and rich is better".|`|AA10641825	I have over thirty-seven dollars in my wallet right now, and yes in a way it makes me happy.|`|mggll8dRaa	Yes, It's Working out Pretty Good....lol..!!|`|MH8cR5bhaa	A lot happier than I am now.|`|OKClYfDQaa	Circumstances apply:|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	absolutely not. Yea it might help my financial situation, but money isn't what makes me happy.|`|00dde3824bb31a5760d4b4cdc75e4641aa	yes!|`|YyEEAJBkaa	It will buy me a big bag of hash, to tide me over until I decide.|`|AA11241794	Having a lot of money might not make me truly happy, but it will make me feel a whole lot more relieved and comfortable! That's a damn good start towards happiness.|`|34b42349a1e9daf8ca942057c78194c7aa	I'd like to find out. |`|EkaB7xrSaa	No, not necessarily, but it will sure help a lot of the problems I have that are making me unhappy, bills, rent, don't have money to go to school yet I really really really want to go and get a career, don't have insurance & I really need to get my tooth fixed (it's making me miserable), I just got a flat tire last week, it was my 21st birthday a couple weeks ago and I didn't get to do anything at all because of money issues & I couldn't buy groceries for a while because I am extremely broke so I've been living off oatmeal for the past month. It won't make you happy, per se, but it will help you stress out less and maybe a bit more carefree.|`|1EHmi2Y1aa	More money would definitely make me happy. I could afford good therapy, healthier food, transportation to visit friends and loved ones, take trips to different places, new countries and museums for learning, beaches and gardens, for calming. I wouldn't have credit problems always on my shoulders. I could help out others, family, friends, strangers, decent charities. Afford school. Etc...|`|iVv6bFW2aa	In and of itself no.Money can't buy you love, complete health, family and friends. |`|i0OVwfcyaa	Not completely, but it would still be nice.|`|CJwioqPsaa	deffinitly happier. anyone who says no is a liar|`|OxFsslN8aa	Quite the opposite.  I would turn down a large sum of money which I didn't make on my own.  |`|i56ZDbT6aa	Money doesn't make you happy cause if it did, you woulndt see all these rich people killing themselves. Money didn't save them.|`|pgWv8VaLaa	No. But not having enough money will make you unhappy.  .|`|d5zEYomEaa	People can choose to be happy regardless of how much money they have. Money can either enhance someone's happiness or misery, depending on what they are to begin with. I've been both rich and poor and my best times were when I was dirt broke but I didn't realize it until later when money was a big bore that kept me stagnant in a static 'comfort' zone full of emptiness.|`|do1Bz6U0aa	For a while.|`|236b0efe0cd727ee742018b701390d03aa	Money isn't supposed to make you happy. It's supposed to take care of your needs so that you can properly address the happiness issue without being over-encumbered by stress and exhaustion.  I don't know who ever said you can actually literally buy happiness, but I think he was just misquoted. It's easier to get to happiness from being content with your needs met than from being anxious, stressed and exhausted.|`|e822efd0cc7f878f1ea90dd270d141c5aa	Money does lead to a feeling of security.  If I did not have what money I do have (earning power) I could not afford a house and a car or things for my family. So too a certain extent money does lead to happiness or at least less worry.  We no longer live in a world where you can live off the land.  Everything costs money - except the air we breathe and our personal relationship with God.|`|X548yCR6aa	What? I already have a lot of money.    And I'm not happy.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	Most people don't feel happy.    Most people don't have lots of cash sitting around.    Most people "think" that happiness will come when they achieve something they are presently lacking.    They are reaching for cash, . . . believing it will make them happy.    John D. Rockafeller was asked, "How much is enough?"   I'm told his answer was,  "A little more than I've got now."    Everyone is looking for "a little more" than they have now.       The trick is to live on a little LESS than we have now . . . so we have what we need (not want, need) and have some to save for a rainy day.    Dan in Miami|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	No, you can't buy real friendship or love with "a lot of money".    I wouldn't mind having just enough money to live comfortably though (and my comfortable is more like the beer and chicken-wings budget, not champagne and caviar budget).  It would be nice not have to choose week to week whether to eat decent healthy food or pay my other necessary living expenses and which takes priority.  It would also be nice to not have to go without a closet full of clothes that aren't all worn out.  But then, I have it better than many others, so I deal, and thank the gods for what I do have.      Hmmm...I get a thumbs down for being honest that some weeks I have to eat "broke food" in order to pay my rent & utilities, and I can't afford to buy new clothes so I keep patching the ones I have - that's nice.  And when I do have extra money and can maybe buy a desparately needed new pair or two of pants, I also donate a few bucks to charity - would that make me worthy of some more thumbs down.|`|c5a85cfe9cbcc6dccde30454562993cdaa	Happier than living in poverty|`|Ef83kV3Qaa	I don't want to be rich by any means but, if I did have a lot of money I would buy my Mom a house and set her up with a full time nurse so she could finally go home and be happy. (she's in a nursing home and her insurance doesn't cover in home health aids) THAT would make me happy.|`|EIK4TaWoaa	I have been happy without money. Some of the happiest moments of my life happened without any money being involved. But from personal experience I can say it's much easier to be happy when you have a full stomach and a save place to live. Both these things usually need cash.    Often I tell my children money doesn't buy happiness but it does buy comfort.     Now I've been homeless a couple of times and at one point down to 109 pounds (less than 50 kilos). The worse thing about not having money is how you become the dirt beneath people's shoes. No cares to see you or know you. That's worse than being hungry.    What do they say in Russia, if you want to know the really character of a person just give them all the power in world for five minutes. I say if you want to know the real strength of a person take everything away from them until they break. Poverty is like torture and everyone does eventually break.    So no -money in and of itself will make me happy but if you have some to spare I will take it. If you have a lot of it to spare I'll promise you I'll spend it on making as many people as possible comfortable with it. Of course one thing that's better than money is human company. So maybe the next time you see a ex-veteran who served in some place like Chechnya and is now forced to sleep on the streets, maybe you'll invite them into your home, let him sleep on your floor and eat the left-over scraps from your dinner. Things like that put the whole money question in another point of view.|`|M2UWOTAjaa	Money makes life easier. Yet paranoid people find being rich quite difficult, because of course, everyone is after their money. Very depressed people just destroy themselves with more expensive liquor or drugs. Take a look at Hollywood stars - many of them are very neurotic.  Being famous would make me happy. Money is gravy.|`|6tVMvbiiaa	Money doesn't buy happiness or love.|`|yk7jmSnDaa	nope because money can never buy happiness.|`|12d085c07ed4a200824c939e8bb8b7a6aa	For some it will.    I won't lie. I could use a bit more.|`|AA11161235	It makes things easier but cannnot replace happiness.|`|i2M7lyPgaa	not at all,  there is no peace outside the will of God|`|jUWwcknJaa	It just gives one more choices.  Good and Bad.    |`|tFkT8RFbaa	yes|`|da89ae5397a4e8f107ac80ebd9de3c8baa	No. I have a lot of money and happiness comes and go. Happiness is based on the moment. Joy, however, is not. Joy is based on one's relationship with Yeshua.|`|ifYTQCf9aa	No, but the fact that I wouldn't have to work in a cruddy job to support myself would make me happy.|`|6kHQ4jtMaa	temporally |`|PCRcoO6Waa	No, I don't think so, but I never had a lot of money so I would never know.|`|CMuaKItfaa	No, but it would keep the creditors off my back!  I've never had a lot of money but I have had more disposable income than I currently have now and I would so rather have a little extra.  It makes life just a little less stressful!|`|Lt6Tsauraa	It sure is nice to have it, but having someone to share it with makes me happy.|`|wJXnb68Baa	no. in fact it's been shown that people who win the lottery are often less happy or just as happy as they were before a year later after the win. money only buys material things...not the things that make people truly happy. |`|rimLLVfHaa	money gives you momentary happiness, but over a life time it cant replace love|`|49e1259f4652a9266c0832c5e32ffa23aa	The money is designed for our life needs only.

This includes storms, earthquakes, volcanoes, well . . . most of nature, when you come down to it.    Also, people in high positions of power and people with an abundance of wealth. People who are elected by voters to be their leaders and administrators. My boss at work. My wife.    But, I do not worship those things. They still have higher power than I do. I accept that as a fact of life. I hold some power over others, as well, but they do not worship me, nor do I want their worship.    I had a boss who once asked why I didn't respect them. I told the person that I treated all people equally, even the president of the company for which we worked. If the boss asked me to do something, I would do it, but I would be not be honest if I did not express my opinion on matters of management.|`|q3KCDrMAaa	Yes. It's in your own spirit.

I've seen a few myself.|`|b2efe4c24f079486fbaff579f92c1c00aa	Yes, I believe there is.|`|5JqCObDSaa	Yes, God is a Spirit and those that worship Him must worship him in spirit and in truth. We are spirits and we are just clothed with a fleshly house.      For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places, EPH 6:12.     As we grow in grace, the spiritual warfare only increases. As we go forward and become mature Christians, the warfare doesn't get won; it gets greater. In GAL 5:17 we read, "For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would."     The Psalmist understood the days of darkness and of light as a result of his spiritual warfare. Listen to what he says in PSA 139:7-11, "Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me."    The definition of Spirit(s): "wind" or "breath", invisible; nonmaterial part of man(as opposed to body or flesh); an evilpresence that can possess or influence a person; an attitude, mood or disposition; a supernatural being.  There are two types of spirits, good and evil and we have nothing to fear about evil spirits if Christ dwells within you:  Greater is He that is in me, than he that is in the world 1John4:4|`|PEWKoIOvaa	WE are the spirits among us.  yeah.|`|zzpRimmwaa	No.|`|52DQfbJkaa	In my bloodstream ,,Yes,,LOL..|`|kngZ5o3Naa	The people who believe in God believe that when a person dies, their souls are whether being punished or in heaven until the judgement day.

He's coming on a cloud and every eye shall see him, I want to go back with him when he comes = )|`|gqhoCu3faa	For The most important facts of your question, please visit the web side http://www.mormon.org   &   The Secret   There have to be a purpose for life otherwise we will miss the peaceful path of happiness to choose what is right & wrong.  So,  Spiritually, what is God?   Whats makes God as god?  What is Gods Power?   Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything and most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from my hard study & research effort with the help from god, I realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end and also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So we cannot get anything from nothing. & how could that be possible to be perfect in perfection always, ah? No way has the perfection of god come first or the growth towards perfection. There is No End & there is No beginning &   LOVE IS THE ABILITY      If you dont still agree,   NOTE THIS  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is good & Almighty.      If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith.   Good or bad, Good with bad, we choose both for our life purpose so values are most important, God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, No pleasure and without pleasure, no pain. So without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them in our development towards the perfection of God. So, you use pain & pleasure instead of pain & pleasure use you. I mean the vision of your future should be clear & it have to pull you rather than you have to push so you must link a lot of pleasure in order to succeed in your Best job. When you feel strong enough links a lot of pleasure in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure.     It is wonderful nature for us by the true God. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. &  If you think, even expert can be wrong then you have to make the fine research in all most everything so It is hard & some time, it is impossible to achieve so Why we need inappropriate action to find the owner of higher power? So, because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. & All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory so closely, Have a look at this world of wonders of yours and then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice and then Having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best. & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now & try to know where you come from to have the great gift of understanding & then, have the faith to become the best winner in your life.     The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.     Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for it.

What we think we know is that for life to evolve a planet would have to be about our size, big enough to hold an atmosphere and small enough that it's gravity didn't crush anything less solid then a rock.   It would have to be in about the same position we are in relative to our sun so it was warm enough to support life and not so warm that protein chains and amino acids couldn't form.   Most likely it would have to have a large supply of water.    Science fiction speculates that there could be other forms of life based on something other then carbon but we can't support that.  We have no idea how many worlds there are but statistically it is probable that others fit the bill.  But they would be uncommon and on those worlds allot of things would have to go just right for life to evolve and then evolve intelligence.  But it is very possible and more likely then the idea that there is no other intelligent life in the universe.     But we don't know and unless that life contacts us we won't know for quite a long while.|`|214a84419a27f7b719e60de8e61dbd12aa	The Heaven,even the Heavens are the Lord"s :but the Earth hath He given to the Children of Men; Psalm 115: 16    Answer:     In the Beginning God: Gen; ch 1:1  Don"t miss it for the World:

But to form an opinion has to interact with the person for longer periods of time, otherwise you are giving in to prejudice|`|5JqCObDSaa	Not usually, but I am sure there have been occasions where the way a person looks has formed a judgment in my mind. I try to look at people through Jesus' eyes, like He looks at me when I was in a mess, and he had to clean me up and he still loved me enough to do so. That reminds me, I have a poem I was given to read for our Christmas program at church...hope you don't mind if I share it.    JESUS' EYES  by Pamela Kessler    It has been said that Christmas isn't special unless seen   through the eyes of a child.  But the truth is, for Christmas to be truly special we must see it  through........  Jesus' eyes.  Infant eyes----focusing on a new found world, humble beginnings, yet  divine;  Jesus' eyes.  Toddler eyes----inquisitive, reaching for scraps of wood in His father's  carpenter shop;  Jesus' eyes.  Adolescent eyes----drawing Him away from home to His Father's house  to learn and pray;  Jesus' eyes  Sparkling with laughter as disciples pull overflowing nets from   unproductive waters;  Jesus' eyes.  Tender and soft, welcoming children to His side;  Jesus' eyes.  Sharp and strong as they stare down an angry sea;  Jesus' eyes  Filled with compassion, healing the sick, blind, and lame;  Jesus' eyes.  Drawn in pain as He hangs from the cross and cries, "Father,  forgive them",  Jesus' eyes.  Seeking out people with love and seeing their need for a Savior.  May you be blessed with the gift to see Christmas through the eyes of Jesus and to discover anew your need for the Savior.      I think if we look at others through the eyes of Jesus, we will see no matter what they look like or what they have done, we all have a need for a Savior. Jesus helped me to take a look at myself, so I could look at others differently as I put my hand in the hand of the man from Galilee|`|MH8cR5bhaa	I try not to but when it gets right down to it yes I do.

TVJsOEKNaa	Yes.     I was raised Jewish, and at around the age of 11-12, I was temporarily sent to a group home.     The head councilor of the group home, was highly antisemitic.  I didn't even realize just how bad it was until I got older, because let's face it: I was a kid at the time (I just assumed she hated me for no reason).       Basically I was told that I was a horrible being for being a Jew.  Then, my prayers weren't allowed in the group home: I was told that if I prayed, I would not be allowed to eat with the other children in the group home.  I was confined to my room quite a bit.    She constantly tried to preach Jesus into my life, and from there forced me to go to her church, against my will.  When I refused to convert to her beliefs, my allowances were taken away.     The worse however, was when my grandmother died.  I cried hysterically, because THIS councilor prevented me from seeing her before she passed.  I was told that if I cried about it any more, I would be sent to a mental institution.     - My great grandfather was hung in Auschwitz on my mother's side of the family  - My father's family is from Aleppo, Syria and had to flee from there because of Dhimmi changes: There are only 25 Jews left in Syria now.  The majority of them live either in Israel or the United States.    ---  One of my friends moved with her older son into a new neighborhood.  They are also Jewish.   Her son joined the local football team at his high school, and as a "welcoming gift," the rest of the team shaved his hair in the form of a swastika.   ---  Another of my friends was denied a hotel stay because she was wearing a Magen David.  She was also asked where the horns on her head were.   ----  Many people I know, have had their cars spray painted with swastikas and words like kike.  Yes, this is in the United States: Yes in this damn century.|`|M2vrjRy8aa	against my gender|`|kTc3bfrRaa	even  against  my  driving  skills!!...      yes      ..yes..   and  yes!!|`|5JqCObDSaa	Yes, people discriminate all the time, I just don't take it to heart. If it can be ignored, I do - especially if it causes strife. If it is something that needs addressed, then we need to address it in an appropriate manner with both parties best interest in mind. One key that I keep in mind so I am not to discriminate against any other is that God loves and made us all, so what we have done to even the least one - we have done unto Christ. Bottom line is to treat others as you want to be treated and love everyone the same regardless of faith, race gender etc.. God made us all and loves us all the same.|`|77IUCIsgaa	Obviously.

During World War in Nazi occupied Poland we had to give up ours seats on the trolley to German, and if not you could be arrested and beaten up.Another time my mother was in a concentration camp for 6 months and I was in a Catholic orphanage. When I told the nuns I was a Protestant they said I would burn in hell. Later when we heard Russian soldiers across the River.the nuns were saying that these Communists are going to kill us. I said in turn that they are going to  liberate us, so I got a beating. In the US, I was called a dirty Puerto Rican because I spoke Spanish to friends on the bus as well as at work.

C8gLsP3Taa	I do not know if a Christian needs to learn anything from another religion.   Christians have the Bible to learn from and Jesus Christ.    The Bible is the handbook for man, it is the instruction manual that gives the rules for life and for eternity. With everything that is manufactured, there are instructions for its use. Sometimes those instructions are hard to understand, and a phone number or address is given so that the reader can get in touch with someone who knows the meaning of the words in that document. The Bible does better than that. The Author of the instruction manual for mankind has promised to be with us at all times, especially when we are reading the Bible. |`|5JqCObDSaa	I think we all can learn quite a bit from each other. One thing I have often thought about is it seems to me that every religion has a piece of the truth in it and if we all came together with our piece of truth then we would have the whole picture! I guess that would depend on if we could all agree on what that truth would be.

It's obvious that you care.But instead of doing something like this or handing out flyers in a subway, just be a Christian in your everyday life.Inspire people to live like you.Work for Christian ministries that help people.More good work gets done this way, and more people walk in His way after seeing what a Chrisian really is.|`|c425bd77add075a97bdceeb9591a73bbaa	When that happens to me, I'm usually on the phone calling the cops to come and arrest schizophrenic trespassers.

May I ask your name? (as he reads the chart.    Patient:  Napoleon Bonaparte    Dr. Kalte:  I thought he was deceased.  Who told you that you were Napoleon?    Patient:  God did.    Voice from next bed:  I did NOT!    There are believers of reincarnation here, so it is probable that if it exists there are at least a few historical figures obtaining rewards or doing penance in new bodies, not all human.  The interesting life of a gelded water buffalo for some, and for those deserving of lesser punishment, a period in R&S at Y!A.  According to believers it depends on karma.

Subio a los cielos y esta sentado a la derecha de Dios, Padre. Desde alli a de venir a juzgar a los vivos y a los muertos.  Alguna vez leiste el rico epulon y el pobre Lazaro??  Es Jesus quien no los dice:  Lucas 16, 19-31    En aquellos das dijo Jess esta parbola: ?Era un hombre rico que vesta de prpura y lino, y celebraba todos los das esplndidas fiestas. Y uno pobre, llamado Lzaro, que, echado junto a su portal, cubierto de llagas, deseaba hartarse de lo que caa de la mesa del rico... pero hasta los perros venan y le laman las llagas. Sucedi, pues, que muri el pobre y fue llevado por los ngeles al seno de Abraham.    Muri tambin el rico y fue sepultado. ?Estando en el Hades entre tormentos, levant los ojos y vio a lo lejos a Abraham, y a Lzaro en su seno. Y, gritando, dijo: "Padre Abraham, ten compasin de m y enva a Lzaro a que moje en agua la punta de su dedo y refresque mi lengua, porque estoy atormentado en esta llama."    Pero Abraham le dijo: "Hijo, recuerda que recibiste tus bienes durante tu vida y Lzaro, al contrario, sus males; ahora, pues, l es aqu consolado y t atormentado. Y adems, entre nosotros y vosotros se interpone un gran abismo, de modo que los que quieran pasar de aqu a vosotros, no puedan; ni de ah puedan pasar donde nosotros." ?Replic: "Con todo, te ruego, padre, que le enves a la casa de mi padre, porque tengo cinco hermanos, para que les d testimonio, y no vengan tambin ellos a este lugar de tormento." Djole Abraham: "Tienen a Moiss y a los profetas; que les oigan." El dijo: "No, padre Abraham; sino que si alguno de entre los muertos va donde ellos, se convertirn." Le contest: "Si no oyen a Moiss y a los profetas, tampoco se convencern, aunque un muerto resucite."?    Una vez ms es san Lucas quien nos transmite una de las ms bellas parbolas de Jess: la del pobre Lzaro y el rico Epuln. Es una escena que cada da, cada minuto, se repite en el mundo actual y a la que quizs ya nos hemos acostumbrado.    Este evangelio no quiere hacer referencia tan slo a la desigualdad en la distribucin de los bienes materiales que hay en el mundo y la necesidad de la solidaridad y caridad cristianas, sino que es un reflejo de la trascendencia de la vida humana. No hemos sido creados para este mundo pasajero y limitado, sino para la vida eterna. Hemos sido creados para conocer a jesus y por l salvarnos de infierno. El que se apega a las cosas materiales, como el rico, se ver despojado de todo tras la muerte, pues lo nico que ha acumulado en vida, las riquezas, tambin perecern. Sin embargo lo que propone Jess con esta parbola es vivir en este mundo con los ojos puestos en el cielo, nuestra verdadera patria y nuestro verdadero fin.    Por ltimo, Cristo nos muestra la necesidad fundamental de la fe en la vida del hombre. ?Cuntas veces excusamos nuestra falta de fe en que no podemos ver y tocar a Jess ms que bajo las especies de pan y de vino? Jesucristo nos dice muy claramente: Si no oyen a Moiss y los Profetas, tampoco creern si un muerto resucita. Pidamos hoy a Dios como fruto de esta reflexin que nos conceda el don de la fe.|`|f795e3beb0e7477ac97291364e1d86d8aa	infierno de dante de jonh milton  homero simpson en un especial de halloween|`|681f1c7ae244a55c374d6469775f0d27aa	CUAL PAGINA, ME GUSTARIA LEERLA|`|40de10135c0fe73826b13f767d844b0daa	? q pagina?|`|1244eedd96cf5c5d6ac443daf1e18789aa	Apenas en la Divina Comedia.

8e5f9cb1082d891d0f3075f0e2e92d34aa	Yeah i'm not really sure exactly how they believe. But one reason I decided to answer this question was because I think they are wonderful people even though I may not agree with them. The only mistake they do that my bother others is the door knocking. But it doesn't bother me at all. They always show manners, and they are very polite. I could never slam the door in their face. I think that they are a good example of how alot of Christians should behave. I mean as far as being polite, loving and caring. Rather than stick their noses and the air and play holier than thou, they actually do something that is productive. And thats the way all of Christianity should be.|`|bVLWVonUaa	They don't bite.

The rest stay in paradise earth and they hope that there one of the meek to be there   The way I read my bible it says  Matthew 5:10-12 makes it clear that those who are persecuted for righteousness sake will be in the kingdom of heaven. Not just there 144,000 Elders  Will this be a very small select group of Christians? I dont think so because in   2 Timothy 3:12 says that all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.  Not a few, but all! Jesus made the statement that those who are born again are the ones who will enter into the kingdom of God. not just a select few.  John 3:3 & 5 Jesus confronts Nicodemus with the truth that unless you are born again you cannot even hope to see the kingdom of God.  Is being born again only for a special select few? I dought it very much in   1 John 5:1 says that whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God.  Whoever means anyone, not a limited number of 144,000 elderd from there congergation.   Jesus himself gave a prayer for believers in   John 17:20-26   Jesus Prays for All Believers    20"My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, 21that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. 22I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one: 23I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. 24"Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world. 25"Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me. 26I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them."    Here Jesus says that his prayer is not only for his disciples but also for all those who will believe in Jesus through their word. What did Jesus pray for them? John 17:24 says that he prayed that they would be with him where he is. Where is Jesus? the last time I read my bible Jesus is in Heaven.  John 14:2-3 says, "In my Father's house are many mansions, if were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also." Jesus is in his Father's house and he desires all those who have believed in him by the word of the apostles would be there with him.   |`|AA11935435	Olivia, the only way you will satisfy your curiosity, is by opening your door and talking to them, ask them the questions you want to get answers for, since they always come to your door, isn't it better to get the information from the horses mouth so to speak, than asking a third party especially since as you said you know, that a lot of Christians argue about Jehovah's Witnesses, and say things about us, but we will not bite you if you talk to us, no, satisfy your curiosity talk to the Witnesses that come to your door, the reason they come to your door is out of Love and because they want to help you and encourage you to read your Bible.|`|zwNaZbKlaa	I knew this one JW girl.

db8e7b296f02680975367f9a5a801cf8aa	Yes once in awhile my husband tells me I thought I told him something but didn't.     Thank God it wasn't nothing important.     Recently a friend told me I don't pray enough for her when her and I are on the phone. I'm not the prayer warrior she is publicly. But maybe I need to look at the friendship and ask Him if we should continue to be friends.     She hasn't accepted my apology for failing her as a friend and sister in Christ. She hasn't apologized to me for failing me as a friend and sister in Christ.     So maybe her and I should no longer be friends since I've failed her and she won't apologize for her faults.

Se me ocurre que escribas a un canal de noticias en donde vives, aqui en DF si uno escribe a Hechos en TV Azteca, si te hacen caso, van al lugar y los ponen en evidencia.  Ahora, eso de la fregada musiquita vaya que cansa y pienso que es falta de organizacin de las empresas, falta de educacin con el consumidor de sus servicios y por "n" motivos ms, pero lo peor es la falta de consideracin, repito, para con nosotros que hacemos uso de sus servicios ya que si fuera un poquito ms considerados, se daran cuenta de que sin nosotros stos no tragan, as de simple y desgraciadamente en Mxico se vive una burocracia terrible, en un pas donde el Civismo brilla por su ausencia y no le dan importancia.

18be83adf26491424d29aa61ef0530d6aa	If the reports are correct, and there seems to be no indication they aren't, Jackson would not be the first member of his family to convert to Islam. His brother, Jermaine, is also a convert.      According to the sources, Jermaine was the one to provide Michael with books about Islam and encouraged him to convert. The report says the pop star read the books and even added his comments on some pages.      He hates the Jews...so I'm sure the move won't correct that.  Jackson started a heated controversy after it was reported that he referred to Jews as leeches in a phone message to a former business partner.      Referring to Jews, Jackson was said that "they're like leechesI'm so tired of itThey start out the most popular person in the world, make a lot of money, big house, cars and everything. End up penniless. It is a conspiracy. The Jews do it on purpose."     He apologized...http://news.softpedia.com/news/Michael-J... you can't take those words back.|`|AA10493307	Because the Nation of Islam protected him when he went through the child molestation trials.  |`|fFq68dJYaa	He owes an arab a ton of money... probably hopes to cut the debt.|`|GE6vqqF8aa	Because he's an idiot like 99% of the others in show business.|`|bZo5Z53Uaa	It concerns you why sweetheart....?    **EACH TO THEIR OWN WAY**|`|KVVD3B9vaa	He's being sued by an Arab.

If he did convert, which I doubt, it would be simply one more step on his way to never never land....meaning the loony bin.|`|ycuegj1Qaa	Because Islam is a very powerful and peaceful religion and maybe he thinks if converts, he will finally find happiness, prosperity and peace in his life.|`|gutCHke2aa	I feel he converted to Islam for publicity.
6kUx7fwcaa	Biracial marriages may not be as common as it should be statistically, but people don't get married to match statistics.  Biracial marriages are probably more common in the Northeast section of the USA and the West Coast and not so common in the South and Midwest.  I think asking about biracial marriages is an interesting point.  What is a biracial marriage?  Many people only think black and white, but how about American Indian and Caucasian, Asian, Arab, Indian, Eskimo, Hawaiian, Southeast Asian?  I have met some people from India who wonder about how dark other people from India's skin is and Chinese and Europeans who talk about minorities in their own areas.  How can this be when 98% of our genetic material is all similar and the rest is individual differences?  Maybe two Caucasian people marrying is biracial, hmm?  The genetic difference is almost similar between them and anyone else, unless they are twins. |`|iVv6bFW2aa	Answering this is difficult because a person like President Obama could be considered Black.Given that caveat the range of Biracial marriages is 4.3% in NY and as high as 44% in Hawaii.According to US racism most Americans whether Black or White could be considered bi racial. I expect that with the slowly receding racism in the US there will be more such marriages|`|3638ac9124375fb3b5c255eae7f22d77aa	No. They only make up 4.9 percent of all  marriages.|`|F2wI6NGNaa	im in a biracial marriage im white my husband is from japan it depends on where you live some towns we will get stared at like we have extra heads some places we jsut kind of  blend in. |`|VYPeoEdnaa	I would hope so|`|4EkE8eebaa	Only 5% of marriages in America are biracial. Not so common if you ask me.  However, in Australia, 17% of marriages are biracial and I live there.|`|tZ1XPd1paa	its 2008... of course|`|LvqUmyesaa	not really|`|RcFnpSCsaa	No.
iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, I agree with Spinoza because once a war takes place seeking  revenge is inevitable, and under these circumstances totally understandable.As in the Law of Physics.Action brings forth a reaction.Therefore techniques to achieve reconciliation must be developed and applied, to avert further damage.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	The evidence is undeniable.  You have groups of people enacting their prejudices for centuries based on some offense that occurred in the beginning of time.  People just can't let go, they have to carry their pain generation after generation, while at the same time saying they seek happiness and justice.  Why can't they let it go?
0ke2zRg4aa	Christmas is a pagan holiday, my dear.|`|4INE794zaa	Nope, my entire family celebrates. No jesus needed.|`|ZXUZxPwYaa	The theists usually end up in fights anyway.|`|wwdllMzYaa	would i?  lets see, probably, if i didnt join in  but as i join in and have my family with me , some of whom are christians , some are atheists, and i myself am a pagan athiest  so no, theres no lonliness in my xmas celebrations, me and my fiance have the best time togheter|`|8tF9Py9Daa	Guess what: not all Christians are haters.  I spend the day with my family--and they DON'T try to shove their beliefs down my throat.  See, we have this family tradition going where we accept each others' beliefs without criticism.  Try it!|`|dd6rgtL7aa	You're obsessed.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, I would. Although I am an agnostic, I am not that fanatical. So if it was a family affair with no prayers I would participate. It's not always useful to destroy a person's illusions.|`|RNKSq3iEaa	Well, I don't live with my family any more. They don't like non-Christians.    My friends and loved ones just take the Christmas break to get together, feast, and be merry. It doesn't have to be a religious holiday.|`|jW0VqZcOaa	Nope.    I celebrate "Xmas"...    I've "X"ed Jesus out of my celebration.|`|Lm3JBhfzaa	I'm guessing you mean all non Christians. No, my family will be celebrating my holiday.|`|AA11544192	Amazing, there is a question on right now about why did the Catholics move Jesus' birthday to Dec. 25.  They did that by the way to appeal to citizens of Rome they wanted to convert.  Dec. 25 has zero to do with Jesus.  Anybody who thinks they are actually celebrating Jesus' birthday is totally kidding themselves, He was born as best as people can calculate around June.  Christmas is totally fatuous as a celebration.  Its fun, but meaningless.  I often wonder what God thinks about Christmas considering it is a totally empty gesture.  Merry Christmas!|`|AA10093245	Fervor and gaiety? I'm coming to your house.  Mine does it with greed, dissention, and drunkenness.|`|AaKZekyRaa	My family includes me. What kind of family do you have??|`|AA11946554	Never going to happen...but, if all the pagan aspects were taken away, there would be NOTHING.|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	Well, given that Christmas began as a pagan holiday and was co-opted later on by Christianity, I have as much right to the celebration as any Christian.     Though really, I celebrate 'Atheists Kids Get Presents Day'. It happens to fall on Dec. 25th.|`|Ufre5QTaaa	Not really, all I hear this time of year is a lot of nervous breakdowns from my religious friends. I would trade their remortgaging their homes and working 2 and 3 jobs for the peace and quiet I live daily this time of year.|`|LsduvqHMaa	Actually, this Pagan will feel quite at home with all those Pagan traditions surrounding him.|`|e3e2c1ca7924b6012c4e20f5a8dff2a0aa	To hell with my family, my partner and I will be celebrating our gaiety together.|`|7dhLr9Yeaa	My family is atheist, so no. The presents and whiskey keep us warm. I'm celebrating in Denmark, where the festival still goes by its pagan name - Jul (ie. Yule).    Please remember that Christmas is not Christian in anything but name.|`|326183ad638c65397360f6a4dcc9abfaaa	I'm sure atheists celebrate with their families, they just don't inject christ into it.  so, they won't be lonely.|`|uJO0MbShaa	My family are pagan and agnostic!  Whose family are YOU talking about?|`|2ydP2Wyzaa	Nope.  Have you guys noticed that most questions for atheists are posted by catholics/cristians?, like they're the ones who can't stand other people to think different. I mean, all questions try so hard to prove that we are miserable, and sad all the time... i wonder why|`|LsWdTDucaa	1.) It's "atheists".  "I" before "E" doesn't apply in this case.    2.) We WILL be celebrating Christmas at the Chateau du Soleil.  There just won't be any mention of some bum with connections sacrificing himself to himself in order to change a law he himself made.    3.) Although we may read Lemony Snicket's "The Latke Who Couldn't Stop Screaming" on that day...|`|M0EKHHNhaa	Atheists aren't the only people who don't celebrate Christmas, (Chanukah and Kwanzaa are around this time too) But you say that as if the only religions, or lack of religions, are Christianity and Athiests.|`|XKecXwZkaa	Of course not. Christians and atheists alike can celebrate this pagan event.|`|wxEqpMrEaa	Ok so you think that because someone chooses to believe differently than others that they are not part of a family? That's not even close. Christmas is  now a family holiday, not as religious as it was once considered. My family loves me, and I enjoy going to see the kids open presents, to see smiles on their young faces. I enjoy the warm feeling that comes whenever there is such an event that causes happiness no matter what my beliefs are. Lonely? No, I am not lonely.|`|BgASHCXkaa	Nope I will be the one creating all the fervour and gaiety. I intend to get so drunk again. Man I love this commercial holiday!|`|fNw4wJSGaa	December 25 is my birthday.    We celebrate it hardily. So no, I'm not missing out on anything.|`|K5uoaetaaa	Nope, because I will be celebrating with fervour and gaiety and presents and turkey.  The origins of Christmas mean that it is a holiday for all, pagans, atheists, christians etc.  A belief in god is not essential.  And, could you please learn how to spell ATHEIST as you are so obsessed with us!!|`|825953318303d03d2a0b5c5c512b8f40aa	My family are all grown ups with their own families, they are hardly lonely.  I'm celebrating with my husbands family this year, the next day, my family.  No, not lonely at all.
XAlCd8Ebaa	So they wouldn't be happy if they knew the presents came from actual human beings who loved them? Odd.|`|GxV4jGKMaa	Are you saying that atheists should have their children believe in Santa Claus just to make them happy?  My children have always been very happy with the celebrations we have, despite not believing in Santa.  Why not include the kids in the social aspects of the holiday, as well as the gift giving.  Not everything has to revolve around a fantasy man sneaking into your house and leaving gifts!|`|xo4iux9gaa	Merry Christmas.|`|ZXUZxPwYaa	I always told my kids there is no Santa, didnt destroy anything in them.     Why should I rob my kids my wife and I of our happiness by having them thank some non existent being for what WE do?|`|dd6rgtL7aa	Just because atheists don't believe in a god, doesn't mean they won't instill tradition in their children.|`|vxSXsn59aa	It doesn't rob children of their happiness to instill in them a sense of rationality, the knowledge that the universe can be understood and made sense of. The happiness that you speak of is false, and when they do eventually learn the truth regarding Santa Claus, it can be devastating in some cases, though not my own.  I can remember asking my Mother one day, over fifty years ago, "Mom, is Santa Claus real?". She knew that her five-year-old son was unusually bright, so she answered me honestly, "No, he isn't." I then asked, "What about the Easter Bunny?" Again, she said no. Then I asked her, "Is god real?" Her answer was that god is indeed real, and I suppose that to her, that was the truth too, but I knew then that it wasn't any more true for god than for Santa. I pretended for her sake that it was true for another ten years or so, but I've been an atheist since that day I asked about Santa. The knowledge that it was my parents and not Santa who put gifts under our Christmas tree never robbed me of the joy of Christmas morning.  To my way of thinking, the truth is always preferable to falsehood, and though I would never presume to tell another person's kids what I know to be the truth regarding mythical figures, I have never lied to my own.|`|81oQXCxGaa	I'm fine with Santa, the tooth fairy, the easter bunny, and all of that.  I just think that at some point you need to grow up and accept that there are no magical creatures who are just DYING to make your world a happy, huggy place.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	I could give them presents and tell them the story of Santa without telling them it's real. I tell them Harry Potter isn't real but they still enjoy the story and running around with broomsticks.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Yeah!  ("They" just need to watch "Garfield's Christmas!!)  How dare 'them'!!|`|0ke2zRg4aa	Wasn't Santa was made up by the Coca-cola company? Why do Christians keep stealing things? Isn't that a sin?|`|AA10503170	They'll find out sooner or later that Santa doesn't exist.  I'd let it be later but it would benefit them to know it from you and not their schoolmates.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	Oh, and Santa has absolutely everything to do with  the birth of a 'god/child'  2000 odd years ago?  My grand kids expect Santa tomorrow night. Its nothing to do with religion, its the Yule festival celebrated by pagans, just misappropriated by the christians for their own greedy ends.|`|AA11124178	I'm not an atheist, but not all children believe in Santa Claus either. I think (especially in our current economic situation) it puts a lot of undo pressure on parents to buy all kinds of gifts so that their children can believe that some fat man thinks they were good this year.|`|AA12181796	I don't. I'm aware that they will eventually come to realise it is illogical and not true.|`|LsWdTDucaa	Already been asked and answered several times today.|`|12d085c07ed4a200824c939e8bb8b7a6aa	I think you made this "rationalists" word up. o.-|`|a8cc391b9673f066fd38ec01b09a280caa	I think you are over reacting and possibly projecting a little bit.|`|Ufre5QTaaa	Good for you, I happen to hate kids actually. And you know what, I really don't think it is my place to talk to strangers kids, and since i don't have any, then who the hell cares.      But I will say this. I was stunned when I pieced together the amount of hard work that my mom did to make my Christ-masses happy when I was a kid.    And for that matter, how does blind reward half kids develop, exactly. There are far more important lessons that you always get what you want, really.|`|8a70c800a791c135ef9c859f967cd39aaa	U r training them for adult hood?|`|AA11641349	What are you talking about?  Did you forget there are plenty of religions out there that don't celebrate Christmas at all.  Not every girl and boy gets a present at Christmas dumbass.  Judaism, Islam, etc. hello!|`|rSJHzlzsaa	In two years of posting here, you're the FIRST compassionate atheist I've ever seen here. No lie.|`|1zifSO90aa	Why would you think a self centered person would have any concern for the happiness of children?|`|BcePsZ8Naa	That is a big assumption, I am an atheist and I not only let all of my kids believe in Santa (until they did not) but I have let them make up there own minds about the existence (or non-existence) of god. I have known more christians to kill the Santa thing for their kids so that they did not get it confused with what they consider to be the real reason for the season.|`|KWaOBI1Baa	The tears of small children give me nourishment.    Also, every year at Easter I gather up small children in the neighborhood and take them rabbit hunting.|`|LsduvqHMaa	Me and my sisters all figured it out ourselves. I'm sure my kids (if/when I have them) will do too.|`|d7klV6nmaa	My kids are happy when they receive gifts from their parents.  Lying to them wouldn't make them any happier.|`|1lRlNIelaa	Yes I would tell them he's not real but hey! No-one in my family ever actually believed in Santa Claus and we are many kids and my family is Christian. It is not psychologically healthy to tell them such lies. Because e.g. if they find out that it was their parents who brought the gifts or if they are being told by another that he doesn't exist etc. they'll be heart-broken. So if and when I'm going to have kids I will give them gifts and tell them the truth not encouraging them to believe in a coca-cola fat guy...|`|fNw4wJSGaa	Nope. I don't think it's harmful to let a kid believe in the Santa, the Easter Bunny, or Tooth Fairy.    I kinda figured out they weren't real on my own by the age of about 8 and I still kept it to myself even then. Even though I knew it was just my folks, it was still fun to pretend.|`|s7ms1aU0aa	I don't think anyone should. In an Atheist/Rationalist case just make Christmas what they say its not about, GIFTS! Santa has nothing to do with Jesus or God (I don't think.) Just like the Easter Bunny has nothing to do with Easter! It's just tradition based on a good deed that others follow, Easter bunny is another story lol.|`|be025e8eec4977bf6cdb9fb6f0765797aa	YES! KILL THE HAPPINESS! KILL IT!    I have another war cry:    KILL THE TROLL!

ragIbMXYaa	To be honest, both really.   I would be scared of dying, but then I would also be afraid of being forgotten. By dying, it's just the body that's going away - the soul is still there...but being forgotten is a completely different thing.|`|IuBAohAiaa	I'm not afraid to die, it's just another part of this circle of life ... no one gets out alive.  Sooner or later, the vast majority of us are forgotten.  Do you know who your great-great grandmother was?|`|2bk7RL0Kaa	I'm afraid of being forgotten while I'm alive.  I don't WANT  to die but I don't think I'm scared of it|`|8KdWHcJdaa	I am sure that dying is worse than being forgotten. Who cares if people remeber me, it won't matter to me where I'm going. Death has no fear for me, but being in pain dying does.|`|a0da1a66102d9bdcdbbc2a5981c8ac94aa	To die?  Nope.  To be forgotten?  Nope    If you've liven a good life been kind to your kids and grand children then you'll not be forgotten.|`|yQFuZ8plaa	Both, I'm afraid of dying and afraid I'll be forgotten when I die.|`|7WLzDuZ4aa	I don't remember any of my cousins, so I'm sure I'm also forgotten already.  Dying is just a process we can't stop, but we fight it anyways until we're ready to concede to the decomposition of the old body.  From dust to dust, you know how it goes.|`|EgXOeDP2aa	I am not afraid to die just of the manner of my death. I don't   want a lingering death in pain.

Sadly it will not matter if we are forgotten as we will not be here to know  about it.  You are never forgotten as long as members of your family mention your name, if you do not have anyone then no one is going to remember you.|`|AA11673762	Neither, it's the living that's got me worried!|`|aced1634cc8beb7af40e221d3df797a2aa	No.    "My bags are pack, I'm ready to go" -  but I won't be leaving on a jet plane.    To be serious - My journey is coming to an end and I will be ready when this old world stops long enough to let me off.    Yes, I will be missed.    I'm the rock that holds it all together, but time will pass and I will become a memory to those I leave behind . . .until we all meet again.    We, as a family believe in the here after.

I am also afraid of dying after being dismembered (like having your arm torn off by a shark or something) and you know you're dying and can't so anything about it.  I'm afraid of being old and decrepit and helpless with no one to care enough about me to check to see if I'm ok or need something--afraid that if I should fall and hurt myself bad enough so I'm unconscious or can't move enough to get to the phone, it won't be until I start rotting badly that anyone will know.  But being dead, I am not afraid of.  And my goal in life has always been to leave this world as undisturbed as possible--leave nothing behind.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	No, neither. . . . dying is a fact of life, and only people who knew you will remember you, once they are gone, so are the memories. . . |`|W8aiAWe2aa	Both terrifies me!|`|kJM65nXJaa	To die,no.

I know I'll be forgotten and it doesn't bother me.|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	I'm neither  afraid of dying  although not for many years please God and I know that once my immediate family join me i will be forgotten and that holds no fears.  I am afraid of the manner  in which death will come and prefer not to think of it  |`|80lWqRFiaa	Nope, I am not afraid of either one.|`|UN8FWQkNaa	to die you wont know if your forgotten when your dead|`|jUdGNUUNaa	Afraid of being forgotten.

I never think of those things.  I'm far too busy living in the moment.|`|BJLDguOpaa	Neither really,i'm TERRIFIED of forgetting ! I don't want to be a doddery old codger (some people say i'm like that already lol) that forgets what i'm doing.  I don't want to be a doddery old codger that forgets what i'm doing.|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	Yes, I am afraid to die. I would be afraid to be forgotten as well.

It made me think that maybe my fate was in the hands of someone else.  What's the point of being remembered after you die? There wont be much I can do about it once  I'm on the other side.|`|QgzTdZ2uaa	I love life so I don't want to die, but I know I will and as I have gotten older and lost loved ones and friends, I fear it less and less, and I really don't care about being forgotten, I have made my mark on the world, I'm satisfied with that.|`|VpOGcG4maa	It matters I hope when I do die I will have a happy death and will not be in a lot of pain. It will take a few generation I believe before I will be forgotten. As long as my family keeps up the celebrates and our culture then I will not be forgotten.

97p19rjxaa	Yes, I have taken Latin before and found it to be highly rewarding. It helped my English vocabulary and grammar immensely, and I am able to read some awesome literature. It also teaches you to think more logically, and it teaches you to be more precise when it comes to words and language. Scientific and medical professionals will find the vocabulary useful as well (and Greek too).     It was also easier to gain a strong foundation in Latin than it was in other languages I have studied. You will actually come a long way in just one or two semesters, so you will feel like you are making real progress (relatively) quickly.    The main downside is that there is little direct application, as you will not be learning to speak it in a typical class. The focus is on reading.     It's a fun language and I highly recommend it!|`|99SNFVGgaa	I have taken 6 years of Latin altogether, including AP Latin Vergil and AP Latin Literature where I studied Catullus and Ovid. I got a 5 on my Vergil AP test and I got 4 gold medals on the National Latin Exam 4 years in a row where I missed 2-3 questions out of 40. Now that I'm done bragging =P...Latin provides a good etymological base for English and any of the other Romance languages (italian, french, romanian, spanish, and portugese). It also helps you to figure out the meaning of words that basically come directly from latin words, which believe it or not, happens more often than you think. It also helps your understanding of English grammar and it helped me in French.|`|hx6Fu3Noaa	i took it a few years ago. it was really helpful. if ever there is a word you don't know you might be able to figure out its definition based on its Latin root. its kind of hard to learn but it really helps in the long run.

Slo buscas cualquiera de las palabras en el cuadro de bsqueda, aprientas enter, y al principio del primer resultado aparece un cuadro con la palabra HEAR y el smbolo de una bocina. Slo aprieta ese botn (asegrate de tener tus bocinas prendidas antes) y escuchars la pronunciacin de esa palabra.    Esto es muchsimo mejor que tratar de aprender la pronunciacin de una palabra en otro idioma usando la fontica del espa?ol escrito. Por ejemplo, hay una diferencia sutil pero importante entre la pronunciacin de "hot" y "hut". Pero si tratas de escribir su pronunciacin en espa?ol, para ambas tendras que usar algo como "jot".     Ojal te sirva! Saludos!

In fact, I would recommend counting your days in Latin, your blessings in German, your sheep in Chinese, and your eggs (all the ones in the basket) in Finnish.    :)|`|AA11262612	Cause you don't know the total.  Enjoy the journey.  Each day.|`|73b5304a7696ab3e2ee5ce012a40245caa	You'll continue to count them until you decide to start making them count or you die. If you focus on making each day count, you'll be too busy to keep counting them.
82e0091087399517f60d1dca806570acaa	HERE ARE SOME MINOR SIGNS:     The minor signs are scattered through the hadith literature, and depending on the method of counting and other criteria, they can number from fifty to over hundred. A couple are mentioned in the Gabriel Hadith. Let us proceed now to mention some more of them.     Hadith 1 w On the authority of Anas : the Prophet (may Allah bless him and his Household and grant them peace)said, "Among the portents of the Hour is that people will compete with one another in [building and decorating] mosques." [Nasa'i]     Hadith 2 w On the authority of Anas ibn Malik : He said : I heard the Messenger of Allah D say, "Indeed, among the portents of the Hour are that knowledge will decrease, ignorance will abound, adultery will become widespread, wine will be drunk, and men will be few and women will be many, to the extent that there will be a single provider for fifty women." [Bukhari and Muslim]   Those fifty women need not necessarily all be his wives (which is not allowed in Islam, of course). Although some people may come to falsely legitimize it (as was done by a ruler during the time of al-Qurtubi), it seems probable that among the fifty will be not only wives, but also mother, daughters, sisters, aunts, and the like.     Hadith 3 w "Time will contract (i.e. it will appear to be shorter, and its blessings will vanish, such that people will accomplish less in more time), knowledge will be lifted up, stinginess will be cast [into peoples hearts], tribulations will appear, and killing will be much." [Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud]     Hadith 4 w "Make haste to do [good] deeds before six [things] :   [1] the leadership of fools,   [2] the proliferation of police / government agents,   [3] the selling of judgement,   [4] blood being taken lightly,   [5] severance of [ties of] kinship,   [6] people who will take the Quran as music, sending ahead one of them to sing for them, even though he may be least of them in knowledge/understanding [of the religion]." [Ahmad, Tabarani]|`|85abd42dcefcdc439788bbbdcf4b292baa	No my friend, you have the wrong religion...., try the Bible|`|392be90176152554a5e560fdf50bd534aa	whothefuck cares|`|f69a5df1f0968150cbe7520dfed4b8a0aa	in islam,the signs are divided into two part:    -small signs:in fact, it happens right now    -big signs    : occurs when it just around the corner    there are many small signs that was explained by prophet muhammad including wars,earthquakes,immorality and many more.    big signs are like the appaearance of imam mahdi and prophet isa(jesus),dajjal,ya'juj and ma'juj which will destroy all things in this world and finally,sun will arise in the west side    and then,the destruction of the universe will occur    that's all that i can help u....for more details,just send email to me|`|77e34fd6025893599d574f4b6d3dfc9caa	some i remember....  bad deeds will be so common that ppl will stop thinking of it as bad...adultery,drinking,stealing will be very common...  women will wear clothes but not wear them(won't cover their body, or will wear see through clothes)  there won't be respect of elders.  no of women will increase than men until at end 1 men will be responsible for 50 women.  use of cars will increase lot,ppl will stop covering distances by feet.  there will b two hajj in that year...  girls will act like mothers of their mothers(extreme disobedience n disrepsect)  n at just the verge of qiyamat,sun will rise from west n will move towards east.  may Allah keep our honour on day of judgement(ameen)
aO4iCwtoaa	Jews don't have last rites, as the other answerer mentioned.  However, there are very specific preparations that have to be made for the body to be buried.  This is not generally done by a rabbi, but by what is called a "chevra kadisha" - the Jewish burial society.  The body is washed and dressed in a special linen shroud (called "tachrichim"), and prayed and watched over until the funeral occurs to insure that no harm comes to it (not in a supernatural sense, but to avoid it being embalmed or otherwise tampered with, which is forbidden in Jewish law).  Autopsies are not permitted unless they are legally mandated.      The body must be buried as soon as possible - usually within 24 hours (the only exception would be if the death takes place right before the Sabbath or a holiday, when burials do not take place, or if the body must be transported to another city for burial).|`|lsuVEx0Faa	Full bio suite, until you know how they died.|`|379b50dce4fc66c5c2a45e76914bd311aa	no, theres nothing like Last Rights in Judaism, but from my understanding when a person passes, the body is not left alone for even a minute until it is buried.  the body is washed and wrapped by trained people.    the funeral is, when possible, within 3 days of death.
kAapL52taa	experimenting helps. if you're physically and emotionally attracted to girls, i.e. you could love a girl and be in a relationship with her, then you are definitely gay or bi. physical attraction counts too, but it's nothing to change your life over necessarily. it's most likely not a phase, i have never in my life seen someone "get over" gay thoughts. girls are like potato chips, you can't just eat one :D my two cents is you should definitely satisfy your urges and see how you feel about it. if you never try then you never know. it could be the most liberating decision of your life :) good luck and have fun getting to know yourself better.|`|DYTvK8QCaa	If your interested in girls more than guys, then, yes, you might be gay...|`|59f0d623da24062341c864749a68da9daa	I recommend that you try going on a date with a woman, unless doing so will put you in physical danger (like if you live in an religiously or socially conservative area/country where being in lesbian relationships is illegal).  If you're up front with the other woman and say you aren't really sure how you feel, you should be able to experiment without firmly committing.  Such a decision takes a lot of thought and time.  Bascially, don't stress about it and just start to do what seems to feel good.|`|4048ad82d67909905629720173b0aa1caa	Why do you want to be type cast???? just be normal it is bad enough without trying to be different.|`|vBtZQ2HBaa	same here lol  but i already know i am :)  anyways,  picture yourself with a guy that alot of straight girls would find attractive. and i mean picture yourself "doing it"  with them.   if you cant see yourself with any guy then you might be lesbian.  plus how does your heart beat near guys and girls :)  its not something you can help if its how you are then its how you are :)|`|kugv1L8waa	you may be .|`|57dBKH7qaa	i believe you are. the real question that determines this is, do you like guys?|`|zgxbbGp9aa	If you look at lesbian porn a lot and want to have sex with girls.    Damn, I must be a lesbian too then. :D|`|KXFzjHVsaa	do u feel hot when or near a hot girl  or do u get wet the feeling of looking at a girl in a bikini or sumthing      if its really bugging u go to a gay lezbian bar and see what happens if u  can goto a place like that......|`|xja1QEfTaa	heyyy lebsbo!!!!!! u r totally gay!!! time to come out of the closet |`|YjXFYOwGaa	I am not sure it matters if you are one things or another. Be yourself. If you find women attractive and decide you want to experiment then go for it. There is not a reason to label yourself one thing or another. You are yourself and you have your own tastes.    If you still like men, you might be bi, if you try spending time with a woman and decide that you like watching lesbian porn but not actually being with a woman, that is fine, too. I personally hate labeling any person one thing or another, because it immediately puts them into a box and shuts out other options. There is no huge rush to make a decision right this moment on any labels, or if you want a label. Take as much time as you need to discover your feelings and explore how you feel experimenting. |`|Vxaim3jPaa	Ok this is how    think out this    1. if you had to choose a really hot guy or a really hot girl what one would you choose?- if you said girl then "yes" you are    2.

Before hand you worry about all the changes, afterwards you ask yourself why did I worry so much.  Godspeed.|`|r5Mxre6Saa	a lifetime is as individual as ones life.  When a person can no longer enjoy the quality of life they wish for, when life is more of a trial than a blessing, when one feels no longer useful, we must let them rest.  God will take them when it is their time, not a moment earlier or later.  We cannot change our culture, only accept that the inevitable is at hand, and rejoice in the 'life' they have lived.|`|vTzxxSTLaa	To accept death as something as beautiful as birth most of us are too selfish we cling to life denying the inevitable refusing to accept what must be.|`|e28543bc8f9e3532ab7fa357d27ab64caa	Have you passed the test.|`|ij5Sv6staa	It's called denial.

And then when it is spelled out in the Living Will that not everyone wants extreme life-extending procedures, then "letting go" will become easier.      I think that is so great that you became an R.N. later in life.  Way to go!!!  |`|N42St5pdaa	Bless you for all you do.  It's hard to change a culture.    Ours seems to be the way you put it though.    Too busy to do anything for our loved ones until they are on their deathbed.    We don't want to accept death, that of others or our own.    When they see the death of a loved one, it is a revelation that it will happen to all and they would like to stop it before it gets to them because they are not ready.|`|62s7J8sHaa	As a hospice person, you must have had some experience with at least a few patients who have had near death experiences. No matter what your religious convictions, these experiences are real.    Somehow our culture got the crazy idea that death was the end...(thanks a lot, Charles Darwin?)...and as a result, death has become the ultimate enemy who brings the ultimate tragedy=the ending of earthly life. What a lie!    We need to get our society out of this insane death-obsessed mentality. It is the only way death can ever be accepted as the beautiful thing that it truly is.    Thank you for your unselfish service to mankind. Hospice is difficult, yet rewarding work. You and your wife can be a source of comfort to many people in your lines of work.|`|D2dz7u9Waa	I guess unless people have seen Death up close and personal, like you and your wife have, they don't understand the transformation that takes place. I have witnessed many many deaths and for people I care about. When people come in at the "11th hour" wanting to keep the ill person alive it seems like a pretty selfish concept to me. They weren't there to begin with, so how do they have a right to say in what manner the ill person departs?   I explain my version of death to people of many religions as a caterpillar to a butterfly. The cocoon still remains, but it is empty...just like a corpse. However the spirit lives on and appears different just like the butterfly and the caterpillar (this explanation seems to work well for kids too).  On another note, people don't give enough credit to Hospice Care. You guys are great and it takes a strong person to do that for a living.|`|0HW0FWFQaa	A PART OF MY ARTICLE, PERHAPS IT HELPS.    Now, what are we scared off?     GUILT: We all have something to feel guilty about. We dont know the gravity of that guilt. So we are afraid. In fear, we always think of the worst and that scares us. If we are positive in our thoughts, the fear may be less but not zeroed down. Our strengths are weakened in fear.    DESIRES: A lion does not store any food, a cow does not make a house, a sparrow makes nest only when she has to lay eggs. It is only human being that wants more than what he requires. New desire erupts before previous one ends. We become so much addicted to the desires that we consider them as duty. You must have heard from several people I must get my daughter married before I die or new house must be constructed before I die or when I die, who shall take care of my husband/wife? This false interpretation of desire as duty makes us worried.      HUMAN NATURE: Another thing is, we like to share. It may be supporting our ego or reducing our pain, but basically we like to share our joys, sorrows, achievements, failures etc. Now about death, we cant share. We are not in physical capacity to share.    TEMPTATION: Yet another thing is, given a chance, we would like to correct a mistake. Death doesnt give us a chance. Given a chance, we would like to repeat a success. Death doesnt give us a chance.     GREED: One more thing, we dont like to lose. We dont like to lose our assets. We dont like to lose beloved ones. We dont like to lose enemies. Yes, we dont like absence of opposition. We have developed so much love for friends/enemies, supporters/critics that we feel scared of missing them.    SELF-EVALUATION: We have classified all the things as good/bad, fair/unfair, superior/inferior, admirable/non-admirable and so on This is our own evaluation. Human beings are superior to donkey, so if I become donkey in next birth, it will be bad for me. Now be careful here. Human beings are superior to donkey according to a human being, not as per a donkey. So next time if you are donkey, you may be happy as donkey, why compare as per human being? But this is not as simple as written.     GRATIFICATION: We give weightage to thoughts. They come and if we hold them, they pain us. Just ignore, they will go away. So, one must not think too much about death. But, there is a whole life to think about it. So, it gratifies.    EGO: Why do we think our own death as bad? We are not going to be affected by consequences behind. The effects may be good or bad, why do we think? Is it our ego? Is it our attachment? Is it our false ideas about the world without us? Is it to prove our worth? I think it is all of them.    To sum up, gilt, desires, temptation, greed, self-evaluation, ego and gratification of all results into absolutely baseless perception of death and life after death.  |`|sY7g3ttPaa	Your lifetime lasts until you die|`|DiXJS8Y7aa	Every Moment you Die until you accepts the Death....|`|A17lSMnSaa	My Aunt recently died of cancer we were very close but when she was dying and I realized that I would never see her again And every argument every horrible thing I ever said flooded my memory.

When a person dies no matter the age its an ending No more I love yous or see ya tomarrows its done        How is that beautiful?   |`|zGsNFhQmaa	First of all, I commend you for being so humanitarian, because world-wide love has "cooled off" over the years.  People have lost respect for life.....but.....In answer to your question regarding a lifetime:  The Lifetime of Mammals~>MAN can live to be about seventy or eighty years, but few other mammals can live as long as that. If we base the lifetime of a mammal, not on the years of existence, but on the number of heartbeats, it is easy to calculate whether man truly lives longer than some of his mammalian cohabitants of the earth.   The average mouse lives about 3.3 years, but its heartbeat rate is about 550 beats per minute. In one year there are approximately 526,000 minutes, so if we multiply the number of minutes per year by the number of heartbeats per minute and then multiply that by the life expectancy of the mouse, we have some 950,000,000 heartbeats for the average mouse.  The same type of calculation can be done for other mammals such as the dog, horse, cow, and elephant. For example, the elephant with a heartbeat of 20 per minute, over a 70-year life-span, has a total of about 736,300,000 heartbeats, much less than the mouse. It seems that mammals, in general, are allotted about 1,000,000,000 or less heartbeats in a lifetime. However, if the same calculation is done for man, assuming 72 heartbeats per minute and a life expectancy of 70 years, the number of heartbeats given to man is some 2,600,000,000more than twice that of other mammals.    Isaac Asimov in his book The Human Body: Considering that trees have no hearts and that tortoises (and cold-blooded creatures generally) have only very slowly beating ones, it is safe to say that the human heart outperforms all others. Certainly it outperforms other mammalian hearts by a ratio of 2 1?2 or even 3 1?2 to 1. .?.?. The human body, therefore, in all modesty, and from a completely objective viewpoint, is the most marvelous structure we know of.   This is because the human body was designed by its Creator to live forever.

lfnjwpu1aa	They can do both.  If you see a photo of a beautiful mountain range, children playing, animals grazing.  What the eye is showing you and how you interpreted it may be entirely different than what is really going on.  For instance, the beautiful mountain range, could have a raging fire coming at it at record speed, or a beetle infestation is about to completely destroy it.  The children playing, are half starved, their drunken Dad beat them last night, and there is no food for dinner tonight.    The animals grazing, do not see the big cat about to charge, and end their life, or that the grassland has been sprayed with poison.  We get an instant peek into a time frame of life for a second, and read whatever we wish into it....I may be way off track here, but I prefer to capture the good the bad and the ugly and yes sometimes we get a very distorted view of what is really going on, past and future....thank you..interesting question.

Las dos palabras hebreas para navaja se derivan de una raz que significa dejar descubierto. (Isa 3:17.) Las navajas halladas en Egipto son de bronce. Estos hallazgos concuerdan con el registro bblico, que indica que se usaron navajas desde tiempos muy antiguos. (G 41:14.)    Aunque los hombres de Israel se dejaban barba y llevaban el cabello un poco largo, parece que se lo cortaban a navaja; adems, en Hechos 18:18 las distintas versiones muestran que Pablo se rasur, afeit, trasquil, rap o cort al rape el cabello (BR; CI; Val, 1909; VHA; NM; vanse tambin 2Sa 19:24; Eze 44:20). Cuando los levitas entraron en el servicio de la tienda de reunin en el desierto, tuvieron que hacer pasar una navaja por toda su carne. (N 8:7.) Los que estaban bajo un voto de nazareo no?deban pasar una navaja sobre su cabeza hasta que terminase el perodo de su voto. (N 6:5,?18; Jue 13:5; 16:17; Hch 21:23,?24.) La madre del levita Samuel lo dedic al servicio en la tienda de reunin desde antes de su nacimiento y prometi que no?vendra navaja sobre la cabeza de este. (1Sa 1:11.)    Jehov advirti a Jud que se valdra de los asirios como navaja para [afeitar] la cabeza y el pelo de los pies y para [barrer] hasta la barba misma, representando con ello la devastacin de gran parte de la tierra de Jud y el exilio de la poblacin capturada. (Isa 7:20.)    Dios mand a Ezequiel que usara una espada como navaja de afeitar para rasurarse el cabello y la barba, y que luego hiriera una tercera parte del pelo con esta espada, ilustracin grfica de que una parte de los habitantes de Jerusaln seran aniquilados por la espada. Esta ilustracin indica que las espadas podan utilizarse a modo de navajas afiladas. (Eze 5:1, 2,?12.) Adems revela que el oficio de barbero se conoca desde la antigedad.    Debido al cortante da?o que una lengua enga?osa puede causar, en la Biblia se la asemeja a una navaja. (Sl 52:2.)|`|YxQpI5vgaa	como puede alguien ser tan ignorante y estpido|`|NLZAjlb6aa	No se ...|`|FZSer42Haa	has escuchado la expresin ojo por ojo diente por diente, pues esa expresin es bblica; la humanidad esta as por que as quiso estar desde el pasado y lamentablemente a nosotros nos toca pagar los platos rotos, pero Cristo es amor aunque te mofes de ello y aunque no puede forzar al mundo a ser perfecto porque existe algo llamado libre albedro, si puede cambiar tu corazn, y as uno por uno emprendern el plan perfecto de Dios y vivirn a su lado siempre.|`|ydThzmOgaa	estas en lo correcto hay ese dios y se llama demonio|`|s53USKiLaa	ESE DIOS QUE MENCIONAS  NO EXISTE, ES UN DIOS CRUEL E IMAGINARIO, SE LO INVENTARON, LOS CATLICOS Y PROTESTANTES PARA HACER MIEDOS, SE INVENTARON UN INFIERNO DE TORMENTO DE FUEGO LITERAL.

CON LAS PERSONAS BUENAS, PERO CON LAS PERSONAS MALAS ES JUSTO CON ELLAS, QUE LE PAGAR CON LA MISMA MONEDA QUE A ELLOS TRATAN CON EL PROJIMO.     (SI UNO NO COMPRENDE LO QUE ES LA JUSTICIA, EST EN PELIGRO, HAY QUE DISTINGUIR LO BUENO Y LO MALO, PARA ESTAR FUERA DEL PELIGRO)    EL DIOS VERDADERO NO CONDENA A NADIE EN NINGN FUEGO DE TORMENTO, SOLO QUE SI UNO "NO QUIERE DISTINGUIR LO BUENO DE LO MALO" SE ENCONTR ELLA MISMA SOLA Y ABANDONADA, Y ESTAR SIN AYUDA DE DIOS, NI DE LOS HOMBRES. (Y DESEAR LA MUERTE)    LO QUE SE CUENTA DE DIOS Y DE LA BIBLIA DE MANERA NEGATIVAMENTE Y VIL ES UNA MALA INTERPLETACIN O UN DESCONOCIMIENTO COMPLETO DE LAS ESCRITURAS O DE LA BIBLIA.

One supplies legal benefits, protections and rights while the other only supplies the religious "blessings" of the church where it occurred and the religious community therein.     There are already many churhces who will and do "bless" same sex unions, so that's a moot issue. Legal marriage does not force any specific church or religion to sanctify or "bless" any specific couple.   These are TWO completely seperate things!     Atheists are allowed to legally marry, no one throws a huge fit over two people who don't :"Believe" or attend any church at all. But as soon as two people of the same gender want to get married, legally, all "hell" breaks loose.     It makes no sence.    Marriage, in today's society, is NO more for "making families" than any other union. Most of the children concieved today aren't done so within marriages anyway. Not to mention the fact that just because a person is gay doesn't make them sterile or unable to concieve. Being a gay/lesbian couple has no bearing on their ability to become parents.   So that idea is moot as well.     Gay/Same sex marriage won't threaten the idea of a "traditional" family since that idea is a myth anyway.   Just think about it, Jesus wasn't raised in a "traditional" family, he was raised by his mother and a STEP-Father!   The ideal of a "traditional" family is something cooked up by 1950's sit-com writers and censors.   Throughout history great leaders and role models were the products of "non-traditional" families. Grandparents raising their grandchildren, crack babies put into the Foster system, unwanted children put up for adoption, single mothers abandoned by their baby's fathers, children of divorce...all families are touched by these events in one way or another.   Children raised by same sex parents are no more different or special than any other children raised in any other "non-traditional" families.|`|AA11279122	Exactly..."what is the big deal?".|`|AA12363899	I think so too!|`|fe1d39298167488bffc507ca9f4225bcaa	2 people of the same sex cant technically be married since the first marriage was between a man and a woman set the precedence. They can be together even though it shows a general disregard for the will of GOD. But to call it a marriage is a mockery of the billions of people that have done it since adam & eve. Call it what it is, 2 people doing what the fcuk they want in the privacy of their own home. Why must they force us to recognize anything. I don't force people to recognize my marriage, they just do because it has been done since the beginning of time.

They are responsable for implementing the greatest technologies, the greatest civilizations, arguably the greatest forms of government and organisation. Thats why its seeing as being "up them selves" or "boasting" or "racist"    For other races its fine to be proud because its like not normal people or handicap people winning.

Do I continue to smile and preserve the image, do I fall apart,make excuses, hit the bottle, run and hide, or face things head on...How I conduct myself, and what I want people to remember about me, and shape not only their abilities in handling joy, but disappointment.

jfraWfzcaa	Bienvendia al infierno, amiga.    Efectivamente, lo que ves es el pn de cada dia. Pero no tengas la impresin que son todos los creyentes, ya que son solo unos pocos pero, lamentablemente, son la cara visible.    Tambien hay algunos ateos que caen dentro de esa descripcin, pero la mayoria no es as.    En general, mucho piensan que esto es un "campo de batalla", en donde hay que destruir al adversario a cualquier costo. No conocen las palabras "humildad", "tolerancia", "respeto", etc, y no se dan cuenta que a travs de un dialogo civilizado, con buenos argumentos, y con respeto, se logra mucho ms que con la violencia verbal.    Yo no soy una "blanca palomita", ni me hago la victima de los ataques de algunos creyentes, pero si intento dialogar antes de atacar, y de esa forma me he hecho amiga de muchos creyentes que tienen una calidad humana admirable.

AA11461259	"big sigh" Man Bridgette, very sorry to hear this type of issue. Very disturbing, but very real! Me being in Law Enforcement, stories like this come a dime a dozen and that's bad! But as we tell victims, you must move on, before it worsens!     Try these steps:    1.) Discuss it with her, sit her down and explain the hurt without making her feel too guilty!  2.) Offer counseling for her, or both of you.  3.) And the hardest, if all fails, leave her physical presense (I know its very difficult)    But you must consider the consequences of you and your children if you continue to keep this type of energy around in your presense!     Bridgette, its seems that you are a very sweet lady now I don't think you derseve such pain as this! You seem to have unconditional love for her (as must of us do with our intermediate love ones!) But this unconditional love should only apply as conversation over the phone (for example) when situations have got this bad!  We are civilized creatures but in extreme cases such as this, we should follow the very basic and natural instincts within us. Much like the animal kingdom, the sacrafice whatever to keep there family going!|`|e8PpsqbKaa	Just don't talk to or see her anymore.. not so hard is it?    Love is overrated.|`|cZyeJ2praa	eekk i knoiw what you mean    my granpa is alwasy bugging my dad    he moved to america to avoide the constant naggingings|`|GM0kOZpRaa	woah she steals?  and woah she does all that stuff to your son?  Dang is she like the devil or something? because if she tries to turn people away from Islam then you know.......  Dang, you got to tell her and stick up for yourself but dont be mean and make her cry or something, but just make her think your not so sensitive and you deal with anything she throws at you,|`|RtMZ3Ym2aa	Your mother is right about Islam. What future do you want for your kids - love or hate? She will always be your mother. What are you doing to upset her because people don't just act like this for no reason?    Why Mohammed was not a prophet:    One who claims to be a messenger of God is expected to live a saintly life. He must not be given to lust, he must not be a sexual pervert, and he must not be a rapist, a highway robber, a war criminal, a mass murderer or an assassin. One who claims to be a messenger of God must have a superior character. He must stand above the vices of the people of his time. Yet Muhammads life is that of a gangster godfather. He raided merchant caravans, looted innocent people, massacred entire male populations and enslaved the women and children. He raped the women captured in war after killing their husbands and told his followers that it is okay to have sex with their captives and their right hand possessions (Quran 33:50) He assassinated those who criticized him and executed them when he came to power and became de facto despot of Arabia. Muhammad was bereft of human compassion. He was an obsessed man with his dreams of grandiosity and could not forgive those who stood in his way. Muhammad was a narcissist like Hitler, Saddam or Stalin. He was astute and knew how to manipulate people, but his emotional intelligence was less evolved than that of a 6-year-old child. He simply could not feel the pain of others. He brutally massacred thousands of innocent people and pillaged their wealth. His ambitions were big and as a narcissist he honestly believed he is entitled to do as he pleased and commit all sorts of crimes and his evil deeds are justified.    Why Quran is not from God:    Muhammad produced no miracles and when pressed he claimed that his miracle is the Quran. Yet a cursory look at the Quran reveals that this book is full of errors. Quran is replete with scientific heresies, historic blunders, mathematical mistakes, logical absurdities, grammatical errors and ethical fallacies. It is badly compiled and it contradicts itself. There is nothing intelligent in this book let alone miraculous. Muhammad challenged people to produce a Surah like it or find an error therein, yet Muslims would kill anyone who dares to criticize it. In such a climate of hypocrisy and violence truth is the first casualty.|`|FhXzlnDOaa	It's so hard when someone you love mistreats you.  You wouldn't put up with that behavior from a stranger, but you do because it's your Mom.  That's normal...for a while.  You have come to the point of tough love.  You need to break away.  You can forgive but it's impossible to forget, so don't.  Tell your Mother.  She knows what she did.  She now needs to do something about it.    I did this with my Father.  He needed to change, but wouldn't.  It was when I said change or don't ever speak to me again that he finally changed.  It took a little while and it was the hardest thing to do, but it worked and was worth it.  You have yourself and your children to think of first.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Your Mother needs a wake up call.  Give it to her!     Good luck and God bless.|`|0yTM98Odaa	I'm sorry to hear that, if she has stolen from you etc maybe she needs some kind of councelling, there must be underlying issues.|`|6LBJgACSaa	Salam,    Sis, Id like to say to you one thing, your mother is your mother no matter what. So please dont disown her, stay patient, she carried you for 9 months despite the hardships, think about that for a minute. Deep down she loves you but doesnt express it well. Tell her how youre feeling. Also what exactly do you mean by she took your children away from you? Regardless sis, you have to stay patient with her, you will be rewarded for your patience InshAllah. And remember, Jannah lies beneath your mothers feet. Continue your love towards her, Insh'Allah she will one day see the kind-hearted person you are and Insh'Allah she will open her heart towards you.    "God has forbidden for you to be undutiful to your mothers." (Sahih Al-Bukhari)    Insh'Allah the best.|`|CU2eG18kaa	I'm so sorry to hear that especially since its your mother. I've been in the same situation kinda, although I'm just a kid, with my mom. I have mental scars about my parents that will never go away, that always bother and sadden me deeply to a point where I feel like there's no point of living. It must be harder for u bc ur grown up with kids. What I try to do is keep my space now, meaning don't bother her,but still be nice when u have to. I also don't start any conversations bc whenever I did, it usually ended up in a fight regardless of the topic. So I suggest be as nice as possible but stay at a distance to where u won't end up in a fight. If I think of more ill add.|`|aYi8oEkJaa	i am sorry to hear about your situation dear,  its really nice that you are trying to maintain the relation with your mother even though the situation is like this. but i think first of all, you must not let your son be alone with her as she is trying to confuse him and also since he asked for it. i am not sure if your dad is still around because if he is not then pulling back from her would not be a good idea .. you need to continue what you are doing and try to help her with her problems.. it maybe hard but it seems like you are the only one that is helping her.  why does she steal? .. is she doing it because she doesn't have money or for no reason at all? .. if it is for no reason then she definetly needs help from the outside, it doesn't work if you tell her directly " mom we are going to get you some help " but rather, tell her " mom, we are going to see this person as i need some information (or anything you can think of ) and i don't want to go alone" .. try to trick her into it. perhaps you could also ask her pastor to help you people indirectly.. i hope you are understanding what i am saying. because people will not seek help due to many reasons, and if you know the person needs help then you should "disguise" the help.|`|bWtp8Zyjaa	My grandmother is the same exact way to my mother. My mom tries to constantly be nice and tries to forget the past, but it doesn't work with her because she keeps asking for things that aren't in my mother's reach. She actually talked to a sheik about her problem, and the sheik told her to keep trying because she is your mother.    - Good luck and insh'ALLAH all goes well. It's sad that these days people find it hard to be decent to others unless they get something in return.|`|WnOgbOmiaa	Sometimes you just have to be mean and straightforward. It might show the person ow they are really hurting you in the long run. Its important to look after yourself. You and your family are first before anyone..even mom. Try reading books by Dr, Laura Schlessinger. She's really good with family stuff. She has a radio show here in California. People have been listning to her for over 20 years...she is straightforward with good advice. I promise..just look her up in the library or buy a book.|`|HnX6qyuGaa	umm sis  i got like ur problem   and best think u do is avoid her  as much as u can     i am not saying  cut ur relation but  believe me seeing her once a week or once a month with no fights is much better than seeing her everyday with 30 fights a month|`|CQz8dMzFaa	I understand how you feel, it is extremely hard to live with a person whom you love, but who makes life unbearable because they are so stubborn.  I suggest you confront her and tell her how you feel. Tell her in harsh tones what she does, and how it hurts you. If she denies, stress your point, give examples of incidents, threaten her with walking out if necessary. If it doesnt work, ignore her for a while. I'm afraid that's all about I can think to do in such a situation. Maybe you should ask a counsellor on how to deal with it correctly? Whatever you do, please dont leave her. You're lucky to be living with your mother, not everyone has that blessing.|`|stRWElvPaa	She probably has a mental illness, or is simply not maternal in any way.   I would say keep her at a distance but be there for her when she needs help etc.|`|ea1acceac1e40717f760e9be5fe8f0c6aa	Salam,    First of all, she cant NOT be apart of your life, she is in your blood/family/life whether you like that part or not. Maybe if you tried to make her understand your point of view then maybe everything would be okay? If all means fail, endure the hardship for the only reason that she is your mother. and i know that may seem like a poor excuse, but allah swt will remind you of what you used to do. Read Qu'raan for advice if you want proper advice, I would think you'd find the answers that your heart is looking for in there, and i'm sure you will be taken by surprise by how accurately it answers your main issues. Read about how Allah swt has no respect for the children who dont respect/love their parents. I'm sure you'd be able to find that quote inshallah.    In the meantime, Please dont worry and persevere, respect your mother, for the mere reason she persevered with you and bought you to life.    And Allah swt knows best    peace    x|`|qPSkkPqwaa	Give her ayaats from quran and hadiths'. If she isnt religious and u try ur best to do dawat. Then just dua otherwise stop wasting ur time..[this is what i wud do]..    If she is going against shariah then you have no right to obey her in these. Lut's wife was a disbeliever, remember?     Ur mom might be muslim, God willing. But i suggest you ask this question on askimam.org they might even give their phone   if u ask to contact ur mom!
6ab7a29ce185d0d37c94b6d9073b12c3aa	I never loved you in the first place - it would feel like the ultimate betrayal, like the relationship never meant anything.

Or! loving the            parents  regardless, wanting their presence. Even if the parent             don't want one another.

I had one situation though...where a friend applied for the same job.  The company was very conservative..old values....white..christian.....i was superior to my friend in all aspects.......they were actually joking with me about my friend.....    He got the job.      So i don't feel like being a muslim is really a negative....but being white and christian is a positive in their eyes.|`|xVN6jOPVaa	Omg yes!! i wanted to ask this, nobody else understands! My names so long as well. Its annoying that it puts them off i bet we'd be more liely to get the jobs if they actually saw them in person.
Emk4xuTuaa	When I travel, I like to drive ( the scenic route) stop to eat and,stop to take pictures. It just seems more relaxing to me.  I have traveled by Plane, Train, and Bus. And they were okay, but I prefer to drive.|`|rZhx3Nwuaa	By plane and taxi.|`|5d93feba60a6599e3f77941fe4be59d6aa	I take the scenic route.

Just once !|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	The journey is as least as important as the destination.|`|5qFmukWwaa	My mom taught me young that the journey was sometimes the best part of the trip.  When we went anywhere we would always stop at anything that looked interesting...a field of wildflowers, a roadside museum, a good viewpoint.  The trip that would take 8 hours for other people always took two days for us but the memories of what we did and saw are still vivid.|`|2R3iJnFPaa	In my imagination, it's much easier on the body.|`|WbKBHh8Haa	slowly|`|b3h0ovgRaa	Remember the song 'Take the Long Way Home' ? That would be me.  Poppy|`|Dmaahsc3aa	Oh definitely by the slow scenic route. . I want to stop along the way when something catches my eye.  I want the time to study it and enjoy the simple pleasure it brings.  I want to hold it and touch it and taste it . So many good things are past right on by and no one sees them. No one enjoys them. . this is what I want to experience.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	I just got online and want to know Blu, get where?

But when I could - I took the long way around.    I loved taking the scenic route.    Getting there is all the fun - if you take time to smell the roses.  DeeJay.|`|kYYHw7xEaa	First Class, of course.  I've heard that there's nothing quite like it.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I actually like to go by car. As I can stop and take a breather from  driving. And if there is something noteworthy and of interest to check  out, sometimes a little drive off of the freeway to check it out, is in  order. When we were younger, we'd drive almost straight through to  our destination. Only stopping for pit stops along the way. We'd  eat during one of those pit stops to gas up and check air in the tires.  Especially during the heat of summer, when tires are more apt to  blow and that goes for hauling trailers too. There are a couple of  trips I'd like to make that would require a plane to reach there in  comfort. But otherwise, there is much to still see that I haven't all  within driving distance of a day or so. I've got more time than money  as a senior citizen, and I finally have the freedom.|`|ehnxg6Utaa	cheapest and quickest way I can|`|f32cb1ac88adb7d78b600e293fee465aaa	I don't care as long as I arrive.|`|WfmHoFHbaa	any mode of transportation,i just love travelling. i hate the feeling of a journey coming to an end, even just a bus ride.|`|80lWqRFiaa	I take the back roads and a compass.|`|X3Lp0ewMaa	My husband and I like to drive we always go on the "No Plan, Plan" that way we can see what we want, and go where we want and "Stop And Smell The Roses". Sounds like a a real plan to me. Good Question have a star.|`|uPt0AhOHaa	The destination is important.  Around town, I drive, out camping, I hike, but when traveling long distances I prefer to fly.  When visiting out of state or out of the country I like to let someone else do the driving so I don't get lost.  I can wander in the mountains or desert for hours and not get lost, but in cities I could end up a few states away.  lol

Certo che  i tempi per ritornare ad essere sereni sono soggettivi, ho letto che c' chi ci mette un giorno, chi una settimana, chi addirittura anni, come me, per perdono  presto, mi accollo io le colpe; in ogni caso dipende dal rapporto che c'era con l'altro/a. Io personalmente rielaboro lentamente e quando finalmente ne vengo fuori  come il mondo riprendesse i suoi colori, come se, uscendo da un tunnel, rivedessi la luce...pu anche abbagliarti per un attimo ma  un attimo di gioia profonda in cui riprendo in mano la mia vita e sono pronta a ricominciare....... magari per un altro errore, chiss.

Do not put him in it Please...How bout a nice Green sweater? and a Beret|`|LQ52bOFFaa	Surely you jest.  No, no, no.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	No, a kilt is usually like a family crest of sorts. Each family had their own pattern,own color etc.  I agree with the others, he would never forgive you if you insist on a flowered skirt.  If you have to, borrow the real thing from someone.|`|CkKlZFVmaa	There is no substitute for a kilt.  I think he would be grateful if you did not make him wear a 'nice floral print'.  Have fun at the dance|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Noa kilt is specifically made & according to a Clan they belong to because of their names  have him wear nice pants & shirt  but please no skirt for him|`|AA10405438	If your husband agrees to do this, he's a real gem!  Too funny!  My husband would rather go in his tidy whities than go in a floral skirt!|`|oP3VVW5raa	Yes, why ever not ?    I heard that they were actually thinking of changing from plaid to a flower of the region for each clan.      Can you imagine lots of little pink daisies allover the kilt ?  It would be heavenly.  Remind him to wear some frilly knickers as well !|`|XEbrGfZuaa	LMSS! I don't think any skirt would be a good substitute, unless you  want to make him the subject of jokes all evening. If he doesn't own  a kilt by now, I would guess he never will. As men are of special  orders that wear them associated with their clans, if they are Scots,  or Brits, especially. Have him wear black slacks and a vest and the  proper dress shirt, jacket, and a tie if others wear them. Whatever is the norm, so he won't possibly be ridiculed, please! You wear the  floral skirt, and preferably black floral, since that is an 'in' thing now.  Wear it with a thin black sweater or anything, clingy, is a must. Now  go and enjoy.|`|NUpZqZLkaa	Hehe! Cute idea!    Don't forget a pretty lacy half slip! He'll love that and look adorable too!|`|rZhx3Nwuaa	No no  never, never say that again or you will have the mad Scotsmen, hammering on your door.|`|X3Lp0ewMaa	No No Lady Luck A Kilt is usually a plad/check or a solid color. Not floral.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Be sure he does not forget his boxers.|`|IWyrJ7o3aa	O, Lady he will never forgive you.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	Now LL you wouldn't do that to the gent would you? Would he let you is another question.  I  agree with resi. A nice sweater would be much less drafty and save some of his integrity.|`|ku2tP4eEaa	If you want the man to appear gay, then go for it.  No Scotsman living would wear floral prints.|`|nwnILcEAaa	Now, Miss Fortune, you know the lads would laugh and tease if he were to show up in a floral. Think of the man's reputation, please.

Transennarono l'area con quelle reti arancioni e le bindelle, e ogni giorno vedevamo aumentare la confusione.  Cosa stavano facendo?  Occhi perplessi si interrogavano su quale sarebbe stato il risultato finale.  Poi, come spesso accade in queste circostanze, cominci a serpeggiare quella che nell'immaginario collettivo era l'ipotesi pi inquietante: stavano apprestando un campo di accoglienza nomadi. Insomma... i rom.  La gente and in fibrillazione.  Con un senso di colpa lungo cos. Perch dove abitavo prima era una cooperativa "Lavoratori della scuola", saldamente nelle mani alle ACLI e alle COOP rosse (*), e quindi in quei loculi abitavano soprattutto insegnanti, e insegnanti di sinistra.  Insomma... quel "dagli allo zingaro" faceva tanto leghista, e non a gente iscritta da decenni alla CGIL. Quindi bisognava camuffarlo in qualche modo, adombrare su tutta la operazione inevitabili connessioni edilizie della parte politica avversa, e che SICURAMENTE i Rom andavano tutelati, ma con politiche del territorio differenti, bla bla, oltre che ovviamente Berlusconi era un bastardo.  Io non firmai la petizione che mi portarono una sera. Non la firmai non "perch non sono di sinistra", e non perch sia tanto stupido da non pensare che un accampamento nomadi a 40 metri dai luoghi di gioco dei propri figli non possa essere un problema.  Ma perch credo che la diversit dei diversi non sia una teoria della vita, ma una realt. Sono altres convinto che la diversit sia innanzitutto un problema, e una risorsa solo per chi DECIDE di non rinchiuderla "nel problema".  Una volta ho portato mia figlia alle giostre, Tornando indietro ci avvicin un uomo emaciato, segnato dalla piorrea e dai segni di un milione di battaglie perdute contro la droga.  Istintivamente mi venne da allontarmi. Avevo per mano una bambina di due anni.  Ma non lo feci.  Non volevo che mia figlia pensasse che gli altri siano "solo" un problema.  Gli altri sono altro, e sono un problema e una risorsa.  E se la loro presenza ci inquieta e perch in loro vediamo il lato di ombra della nostra anima. Forse ci vediamo quello che avremmo potuto essere. O persino voluto essere.  Ma bisogna tentare di non averne paura.  Ben sapendo che non sar la tessera di un partito o quella di un sindacato, o una idea della vita a proteggerci.  Gli altri sono altres un rischio. Abbiamo voglia di correrlo?|`|5WY5zkBbaa	Purtroppo fa parte della natura umana.... Se qualche cosa  diversa la si teme e la si distrugge senza neanche sapere cosa sia.

Il "diverso" incute timore. Il diverso va allontanato, isolato. E poco importa dove "risiede" la sua diversit...nel colore della pelle, in un atteggiamento particolare, negli occhi splendenti, nel vestito colorato, in una parola detta a voce troppo alta.   E' come nell'altro bellissimo racconto di Anonimo Veneziano dove le sfumature vengono soppresse per far si che ci sia un'istituzionalizzata normalit.  E' un circolo vizioso dove siamo al contempo vittime e carnefici.

L'immagine di questa casa che brucia sta proprio nel fatto   che nella vita anche se i nostri genitori tentano di tenerci   fuori dai problemi della vita tentanto di bruciare in noi le   nostre case,alla fine queste case sono sempre dentro di noi,   perch l'istinto umano prima o poi prevale,in ogni caso.    Difatti l'immagine dei bambimi che conoscono l'individuo    l'immagine del danno e del trauma psicologico che   possibilmante e gi entrato nel bambino che non puo pi   essere estirpato con il solo bruciare il male alla radice ma   con l'accettazione della cosa e possibilmente cercando di   far capire al figlio i motivi veri della propria negazione per   quello stile di vita.    Uno stile di vita che prima o dopo i giovani potrebbero  afrontare,nonostante tutto.    Bisognerebbe quindi spiegare ai figli,cosa sia la dignit di   quell'uomo che magari ha a sua volta avuto una vita dificile   e che adesso si trova nella condizione in cui .    E come spiegare ad una persona cosa  una bottiglia   perch non l'ha mai vista e tu gli dici che una bottiglia    una cosa di plastica,con dell'acqua dentro ed una edichetta.  Costringendo quella persona a credere che una bottiglia    anche il catino di plastica con l'edichetta del marchio di   fabbrica.  Alla lunga quella persona rischia di fare brutta figura e di   non riuscire a capire niente.    Quindi, molte volte bisogna essere pazienti ,spiegando le   cose ai propri figli con le dovute descrizioni del caso.    Il problema pero sta nel fatto che gli stessi genitori alle volte   non sanno cosa dire ai loro figli e per pigrizia li lasciano   da soli a vedere la TV senza spiegargli niente......  Allo stesso modo di quelli che, pur sapendo come spiegare   le cose, si trovano a dover affrontare una vita la vorativa fatta   di stress che non gli permette di inculcare al figlio il giusto.    Naturalmente, alle volte, capita che;  quanto il preside li chiama per le marachelle del proprio   figlio sono i primi che vanno dal preside armati di mattarello.    Meno male che ci sono giovani che sanno ragionare da s   e prendono di petto la situazione con la dovuta   responsabilit del caso,almeno per uscire dal coro.|`|940170e2750bbd2063ca50d1854f1f41aa	12 anni : un'et particolare .  Lei era la mia migliore amica, almeno cos pensavo , eravamo bruttine ambedue , consolavamo le nostre paure adolescenziali tenendoci compagnia.  Ma i miei non volevano che frequentassai quella casa : suo padre era un'uomo dalla equivoca doppia vita , la nonna di lei aveva un albergo alla "ferrovia " ( tu sai  30 anni fa cosa ci fosse ) ed una volta senza che i miei lo sapessero l'avevo anche accompagnata l .  mia madre cap che proibirmi di andare l avrebbe avuto effetti contrari e pericolosi , cos smise di ostacolarmi ed ebbi la possibilit di comprendere da sola .

La casa  stata bruciata probabilmente accidentalmente, visto che questo fumava e beveva, una disattenzione, un colpo di sonno e via...  I genitori non avrebbero mai fatto una cosa del genere   A) perch probabilmente se ne fregano se qualcuno  piu bello di loro e ha uno stagno e delle canne di bamb, ma cosa gli interessa sono i figli.  B) perch degli squilibrati potrebbero bruciare una casa e uccidere un uomo.|`|1da1f243404c8bca1851b65f7f5bdf3eaa	Non lo so se sia "ancora"  un vezzo...  mi viene quasi il sospetto che a forza di "temere di temere " incoraggiamo in modo esasperato alla diversit e  la esaltiamo o...la inventiamo   ...che sia anche questo solo un fenomeno di moda, il volere a tutti i costi adulare il "diverso", in passato cos temuto e diabolizzato ? Non  anche questo invece  pi che mai un modo per bannarlo e cristallizzarlo, dunque isolarlo  ?   Il diverso o l'idea del diverso  esiste solo  se lo si vuole.    Per rispondere alla tua domanda, da genitore ho affrontato " il diverso"  sempre discutendolo ; con mia figlia, sin da piccola , appena spuntava all'orizzonte una cosa che le  appariva insolita e strana,  la si  guardava assieme, se ne parlava e si cercava  di capirla  ;  la cosa principale che ho sempre cercato di trasmettere a mia figlia  l'autonomia del pensiero e la libert da paure .

B1KPz8pdaa	Man limits his thinking and in so doing limits his capabilities. He fails to see from where he came and to where he shall return.    Many refer to the Almighty as God the Father and  those with a greater understanding will recognise The Father as the Source. The Source is indeed a magnificent energy, a pure energy.     Man must strive to enlighten himself as to the Source so as to unfold and be embraced in this mighty force. It is indeed a magnificent aura and one will proclaim such a desire to unfold and be embraced in this energy.     see  http://www.alleternity.co.nz|`|b5b3a78cd70d9312849f0cb75028d94aaa	I think My God is heart shape.

His/Her form is transcendental- meaning It is not conditioned by time or space. Since God is the source of everything (if one has made that premise), then form too has its source in the Supreme. Since we have taken the premise that God is eternal (you have in the q)- since the law of conservation of energy states that energy is neither created of destroyed. Everything is consisting of energy meaning everything is therefore eternal. However when we understand God as eternal, we mean it differently. Energy is always in flux, but the Supreme is changeless, immortal and eternal (in this sense). Since we have no experience of such phenomena- we can understand that our senses do not have the facility to perceive beyond space and time. That is because our sensory equipment is limited. It is limited so much that our knowledge of our own planet, what to speak of our own solar system is insignificant. Not only limited but defective, and prone to illusions (psychologists have found many for the human mind). Since our senses can't perceive this world even with the assistance of instruments (although because the instruments are utilised by senses- giving the instruments similar defects or limits). What makes us imagine we can behold He who is beyond any limitations? Only foolish pride.    If there is a Supreme Lord then He is infinite and the only way a finite being (a human being) can perceive Him is by His (The Lord's) own causeless mercy or sweet will.     It is said by His own breath (the vedas) that His form is perceived by the eternal pure love of His/Her devotee. To devotees who are completely free from desires to behold His majesty but only His sweetness, He is perceived in a human-like form composed of pure consciousness, and spiritual happiness. Indeed even then He is not limited by space or time. Although the materially conditioned speculator may think otherwise. It is unwise to bring our own limitations and project them on the Supreme Personality of Godhead.    This is not a question of ''faith'' but rather it is directly perceived by the Absolute's own will. It is experienced by sprititual senses dormant in the conditioned being. Prior to his acme of realisation one realises a oneness in eternality, consciousness and pleasure. Then one understands the Supreme is localised but pervasive and distinct. The awakening of a relationship with God as a personality and thus perceiving the Absolute Truth in full is the most complete realsation. All other realsations reside in this realisation similtaneously. It is also acompanied with ever expanding blissful consciousness- This can be called Krishna consciousness.

RIr7kG4Waa	io quasi non so cosa scriverti se non dirti che purtroppo e proprio cos e sono testimone diretta di come a noi italiani ci stanno tagliando fuori rovinandoci di pi quando abbiamo dei problemi.  io sono sbigottita di fronte al destino che ci si prospetta, non so neppure come gli stessi governanti non sappiamo che stanno distruggendo il nostro Paese da ogni punto di vista, tra i quali quello economico  il pi evidente ma forse il meno grave (nel senso che  conseguenza di altro).  io personalmente mi chiedo: visto che il Paese  dei potenti, non hanno mai pensato a come vivranno un giorno in un posto dove gli italiani saranno spariti per la maggior parte perch chi si ammazza, chi ammazza e poi rimane assegnato a carceri e psichiatria, quelli che tentano di obiettare civilmente e che poi magari subisce ritorsioni perch dice la verit, stessi impiegati statali che appoggiano queste pratiche per la paura di rimanere senza lavoro, e poi persone che stano zitte per paura di perdere quello che in realt non hanno pi pensando che accomodare le ingiustizie sia l'unico modo per non aggiungersi altri problemi(che poi purtroppo  anche vero questo)... ci lamentiamo e ci scorniamo tra noi senza risolvere nulla ma facendoci venire le gastriti e alti malanni.  io non mi occupo di politica da quando avevo 18 anni e allora ancora ci credevo e seguivo tutto,poi sono stata pure io travolta da un sistema che  autodistruttivo e che come avrai notato anche tu  tutto a favore degli extracomunitari e gli italiani,che hanno tanti problemi,  incredibile ma stanno lavorando per loro!!  quello che so  per esperienza diretta (io sono nuova su answer e penso che prima o poi vi far sapere tante cose, visto che qui siamo in tanti ed  giusto che se non tutti almeno tanti sappiano,,,)  io ti ripeto, seguo la politica appena appena di striscio, ma posso pensare che dopo tangentopoli e l'euro, sia la comunit europea ad aver rognato al top.  infatti ci siamo entrati per un pelo ed era meglio che ne rimanevamo fuori perch credo ormai che lo stato abbia degli obblighi da assolvere nei confronti di questa comunit e fra essi anche l'assistenza agli immigrati i quali sono tutelati pi di noi dal momento che entrano nel nostro Paese perch ci sono leggi credo sancite dal tribunale di Strasburgo e dalla convenzione di Ginevra e se non vengono rispettate ci vanno di mezzo i nostri politici (correggetemi sempre se sbaglio ma pi o meno e cos), i quali di sicuro non si vogliono privare di niente e vogliono mantenere il loro "prestigio" e allora ripiegano sul nostro lavoro aumentando le tasse, richiamandoci alle multe anche di vecchia data, aumentando i prezzi dei prodotti importati e dei servizi vari (tipo sanit che  tralatro un altro bel paio di maniche a livello di porcherie interne).  gli stranieri si fanno forti di questa cosa perch garantiti dagli accordi europei e la cosa pi brutta  che se noi scioperiamo non serve a nulla mentre invece gli straneri insorgono in modo vero e proprio e glielo fanno fare senza restrizioni.... vedi paolo sarpi a milano... se noi italiani avessimo fatto quel macello, avremmo preso tante bastonate(invece i vigili di milano si fanno saltare sulla macchina e aggredire) e di fatto le prendiamo veramente perch noi abbiamo solo da denunciare i nostri tribunali che ovviamente assolvono gli statali anche colpevoli di reato, mentri gli stranieri si rivalgono delle ambasciate che comunicano a strasburgo se ci sono ingiustizie e in quel caso ci sarebbero casini pi grossi per i nostri politici.  magari avr spiegato male quello che stiamo vivendo ma la situazione  pressoch questa.  dovremmo andarcene s tutti da qua, l' Italia non  pi nostra e nemmeno esiste pi.  anche nel paesino dove vivo io i vigili urbani hanno preso botte dagli stranieri e in questo modo hanno ottenuto quello che volevano; io invece mi sono rivolta al comune per problemi di sussistenza economica e sanitaria perch ho un figlio piccolo e sono genitore single e invalida e, credimi ti giuro, nonostante abbia tenuto il classico nostro comportamento da italiano sottomesso, con una scusa mi hanno fatto attendere l'arrivo dei vigili che mi hanno fatto persino i lividi alle braccia perch me le hanno prese e contorte dietro alla schiena perch ho detto giustamente che se non mi riconoscevano i diritti assistenziali e quelli del bambino sarei andata a fare un esposto che sto ritardando ancora di farlo proprio per il trauma che c'ho ricavato quel giorno e per la sfiducia che mi entrata fin dentro alle ossa...  faccio come tutti, cerco di tirare avanti e sto cercando di individuare il modo di uscire dalle mie problematiche ma,,,  sarebbe da fare veramente come gli stranieri e chiedere asilo politico all'estero data la considerazione e i trattamenti che ci riservano.  ora chiudo che dopo sta risposta  meglio che vada a distrarmi un attimo gi che  domenica.....  ciao!|`|wWFhYucaaa	ci vorrebbe una bella rivoluzione, purtroppo il popolo Italiano  un popolo di pecoroni|`|F56vDIklaa	Si sono daccordo con te purtroppo la situazione qua in Italia  diventata veramente paradossale e sopratutto per noi Italiani direi invivibile , io non sono assolutamente razzista e anzi compatisco i poveri clandestini che spesso rischiano la vita e investono tutto quello che hanno per raggiungere il nostro paese , il problema e che il governo Italiano dovrebbe preoccuparsi prima di tutelare gli italiani poi si potrebbe pensare alla solidariet . Invece loro gli stranieri la fanno da padroni e noi facciamo la fame, non parliamo poi della Romania che splendida idea averla fatta entrare nell unione europea. Pi si va avanti e pi la situazione peggiora io personalmente sono contraria a tutto quello che  globalizzazione , euro , liberalizzazione , sono solo falsi miti che ci hanno portato invece solo povert e disparit, il ricco sempre pi ricco e il povero sempre pi povero .

AA11939647	All sin is an example of that.  There is no sin that is too great to be resisted. "because the one who is in you (Jesus)  is greater than the one who is in the world" (the devil)    Sin is of the devil, and if God is in us, then he is greater than the devil that is in the world.

La Mente (SHEN) alberga nel cuore. Essendo esso a coordinare lattivit di tutti gli altri organi viene comunque danneggiato da una disfunzione emotiva.

Como estudiante de letras, te se justificar la indiscutible dificultad del idioma japones. Todos, incluyendo cientificos, concluyen lo mismo.  Tsegaye me ensenia algo -como puede- Aprendi que tienen 3 formas de escribir las cosas. Una es por como suenan: cada palito tiene un sonido, por ejemplo, mi nombre solo puede escribirlo en su lenguaje fonetico. Otra forma es por lo que nosotros ironicamente llamamos "los dibujitos", por ejemplo, "computadora" en japones literal se 'escribe' cerebro electricidad (interpretacion: cerebro electronico = computadora). Y la ultima forma de escritura es la morfa, o sea la forma simple de las cosas. Por ejemplo, "sol" antes se caracterizaba por un circulo, lo cual tiene completo sentido. En el japones actual, se adopto el cuadrado para identificar al sol, algo que Tsegaye personalmente no me sabe justificar.    Otras razones rapidas:  - no hay limites de "palabras" y no existen las "letras" (dado al tipo fonetico y morfo de escribir)  - sus diccionarios, hoy en dia, siguen en constante actualizacion, lo que hace al idioma aun mas complicado de aprender  - Tsegaye misma me supo admitir que ella puede escribir en fonetica y morfo, pero se le complica con los "dibujitos", cuyo nombre de escritura no puedo recordar)  - sea cual sea la forma en la que redactes, solo tienen UNA forma de decir las cosas, lo que complica la situacion dada la inexistencia de las "letras"  - 90% de los estudiantes de japones estudian solo la redaccion fonetica para  poder comunicarse.. el otro 10% seguro que nacieron de padres o madres de origen japones...  - el chino y el japones no se comunican, senioras y seniores!!! ambas culturas admiten que los japoneses mas bien estudian chino, porque entre los dos, es el idioma mas "facil"!!!!  - y por que te crees que son "ojos estirados"?...porque de afuera ya lucen como discos capaz de almacenar su propio idiomaa!!..jejeje    Estoy en 3 nivel de ruso, y me resulta mas facil que lo poco que aprendi de japones... todavia sin suficiente convincion?...

Ptreosa cuando hablas con el le llamas Petro cuando dices que algo es de el le llamas Petra y cuando dices su nombre Petrosa.En griego para poder aprender las reglas tienes que saber tambin un poco de griego antiguo porque hay 5 ies,2 ees y 2 oes y no se difrerencian entre ellas...y adems no tiene verbos en infinitivo!

Tu pregunta es interesante pero no tiene una respuesta universal. S que podemos darla, ms o menos, desde la perspectiva personal de cada uno y en este caso, desde un hablante de una lengua de origen latino, como es el espa?ol. Naturalmente a nosotros nos es ms fcil aprender el francs que el ingls, porque ste ltimo es de origen anglo-germnico. Y es ms fcil aprender ingls que el ruso, por ejemplo. Y as sucesivamente: el ruso es ms fcil que el rabe, pero este nos sera infinitamente ms fcil que un idioma asitico tonal, como el chino. Cualquier idioma del sudeste asitico, como el chino mandarn, chino cantons, vietnamita, laosiano, khmer, etc...nos sera extraordinariamente dificil no slo de hablar, sino tambin de escribir, sobre todo si es un idioma en que cada palabra corresponde a un smbolo, como es el caso del chino: el esfuerzo mental es elevadsimo. Pero en resumen, sera muy dificil dar una respuesta certera: ?es ms dificil el khmer de camboya que el birmano? ?es ms fcil el tibetano que el mongol?. Creo que hay un lmite cultural que abarcara, para un hispanohablante, los idiomas de origen latino y los de origen anglo-germnico.

JE4PC8ipaa	Si tratta di episodio simbolico e metaforico.  La parola Adamo ed Eva,  indica luomo e la donna UNIVERSALE, cio lUmanit, maschi e femmine, cio il genere umano.  Quando Adamo ed Eva tradirono Dio, seguendo il consiglio di Satana piuttosto che quello del loro Amico, determinarono una frattura nella stabilit dell'intero universo. All'inizio Dio ed Adamo camminavano e parlavano insieme in un'intima e completa relazione (Genesi 3:8-9). Una volta commesso il peccato quella relazione fu insanabilmente pregiudicata. Dio non poteva pi camminare e parlare con Adamo ed Eva, e li allontan dalla Sua presenza.  E' stato punito Adamo, perch il suo peccato, non fu la violazione dei comandamenti di Dio, ma la frattura dell'amicizia con Dio.Infatti, dopo che ebbero mangiato il frutto del  bene e del male si accorsero di essere nudi e si nascosero, allora  Dio chiam Adamo perch la prima cosa che Egli voleva focalizzare era la frattura della loro amicizia. Nascondendosi da Colui che era prima suo amico, Adamo rivel che il peccato rappresentava una sorta di divorzio causato dalla sua disobbedienza, sapeva di avere tradito Colui che era sceso nel Giardino per passeggiare e camminare con lui. La fiducia e l'intimit che lo avevano legato al suo Creatore erano svaniti e non potevano essere ricostituiti semplicemente con una parola di perdono. Le ferite inferte da un amico fanno sempre pi male e sono difficili da essere sanate. Questa corruzione e separazione da Dio  poi passata su tutta la progenie di Adamo, arrivando sino a noi. Nel resto della Bibbia vediamo Dio che in molti modi cerca di attirare l'umanit di nuovo verso di s in una nuova relazione con Lui.|`|cfUwbBD2aa	Perch gi allora Eva rompeva le scatole per la parit dei diritti !!!|`|bead712ea7609b905511890ea80ffbbdaa	Immagina che al quel tempo L' uomo era gi era uno burattino in mano ad una donna........i fatti parlano chiaro....e non  un caso isolato.|`|d61f099a817e452a287bcaa8d24b107faa	il marito non puo abbandonare la moglie !|`|42bf1e8d080df9a80b8dee93137fbe19aa	Perche` Adamo quanto Eva sapevano benissimo le leggi di Dio, invece di essere risoluto ad ubbidire a Dio scelze di seguire "Eva". In Genesi 3:6 viene detto che Eva diede il frutto al marito e insieme lo mangiarono, e nel versetto 17 sempre dello stesso capitolo Dio disse ad Adamo: Poich hai ascoltato la voce di tua moglie e hai mangiato dellalbero circa il quale ti avevo dato questo comando: Non ne devi mangiare, il suolo  maledetto per causa tua. Con dolore ne mangerai il prodotto tutti i giorni della tua vita".    Quindi entranbi hanno peccato e sono stati disubbidienti, ed entrambi meritavano la punizione da parte di Dio.

Le Scritture fanno notare che Eva si fece ingannare pur avendo la necessaria forza di sottrarsi, per amor di DIO, agli allettamenti del "serpente" (in realt stava l per i fatti suoi, Satana, essendo una persona spirituale e quindi non visibile agli occhi umani, se ne serv come un ventriloquo si serve di un pupazzo).    Adamo,  (il capofamiglia) cui il comando lo aveva ricevuto da DIO direttamente, volle cedere per essere alla pari con il Creatore; desider troppo e segu la condotta di Eva. Quando si accorsero di essere stati turlupinati (si dice cos?) avevano gi mostrato a Geova (nome proprio di DIO) da quale parte si erano in effetti schierati!|`|VdFC4bkOaa	Adamo non ha pagato per l' errore di Eva ma per il suo.

Essi rappresentano l'uomo che commette il suo peccato originale: l'orgolglio. L'uomo pretende di poter fare a meno del suo creatore, pretende di essere lui a decidere su tutto e su tutti; perde l'umilt di riconoscersi creatura e mette s stesso al centro di tutto.  Non bisogna leggere la bibbia in modo letterale. La Bibbia  stata scritta sotto ispirazione divina e ci porta un certo messaggio. Leggerla in modo letterale in molti punti pu portare a malintesi, perch dipende da chi ha scritto, dalla cultura del tempo, dal modo di esprimersi dell'epoca...|`|H8oE9nb8aa	ma anche Adamo ha mangiato la mela.

Per esempio, l'etica suggerisce l'univocit del rapporto (se stai con me non stai con le altre) anche se non sempre  cos. Gi la morale stessa, se ci pensi,  unlimite alla libert: vorrei tirare a X un ceffone ma mi autolimito perch s che sarebbe moralmente sbagliato. Il discorso  pi ampio, vuoi vivere senza limiti alla tua libert? Vai a fare l'eremita! Altrimenti accetti dei paletti. Non  detto che la limitazione e l'autocontrollo siano poi cos negativi! In fin dei conti ci permettono la delimitazione di confini entro cui poterci muovere, ma questo spazio  anche fonte di nostre sicurezze e punti di riferimento della vita!|`|1b014b8be164f7de9dd026c633bc6da9aa	L'amore e la libert si annullano a vicenda.|`|e855599e3cb6ff96d617e5c785648ac2aa	Oppure essere liberi di amare?  l' amore  a se stante, nulla condiziona questo sentimento.  O c' l'hai, o non c' l'hai!  La libert oltre che a essere una condizione fisica  anche una condizione mentale.  Ami il tuo prossimo come te stesso = analizzare se stessi: per trovare l' amore che porta ogni individuo a vivere per salvaguardare se stesso (Istinto di sopravvivenza).  Questo amore porta ad amare il tuo prossimo per preservarlo e non danneggiarlo.  La libert  condizionata, l' amore vero no!  L' amore di Dio ci libera dalla condizione di schiavit mentale (inquinamento psicologico derivante da ogni fonte) che ci porta a pensare in modo malsano e di conseguenza agire mal-sanamente con ripercussioni sulla nostra vita : il famoso peccato!  il peccato produce la morte interiore ma l' amore la vita.

Nessuno riesce veramente ad amare! L'amore terreno  una mera forma di egoismo... chi ama  perch chiede qualcosa in cambio (anche amore stesso), e nessuno ama in maniera disinteressata. Amore e liber, infatti, sono la stessa cosa! E ci si esplica in maniera chiara se si considera una verit assoluta, e cio che solo Dio possiede amore! E Dio  libert, poich ci libera dalla dannazione dei nostri peccati!

Cos insegna Ges. Io non capisco il nesso tra la frase di Ges e il concetto di libert della tua domanda, ma sottolineo, non l'ho compreso io. Cmq la libert vera non  malvagia, non mette in difficolt il prossimo, non va contro i comandamenti.|`|c32ee66184b4635f12c5de3590cf5f24aa	Secondo me no..... Ovvero penso che si possa essere liberi anche senza saper amare e per amare non bisogna necessariamente conoscere la libert.... Questo perch penso siano due concetti ben distinti, che possono senza dubbio convivere in certi momenti per non sempre.....  Libert significa poter fare ci che si vuole (a patto di non interferire con la libert degli altri) e venire accettati da tutti per quello che si fa.... Quindi non vedo il concetto dell'amore.... si, si pu amare la libert, ma i 2 concetti per me non sono strettamente collegati....  Questa  la mia idea.....|`|oC6kJZK6aa	Il nostro concetto di libert  "fare tutto quello che si vuole".  Questo include buone azioni e cattive azioni, che hanno buone conseguenze o cattive conseguenze.  La libert vera  quella che ti fa conoscere PRIMA queste conseguenze, per poi decidere tra bene e male su una base pi ampia.  La Bibbia aiuta molto anche in questo, e ci avverte di molte conseguenze delle nostre cattive azioni, e ci fa capire che ad agire con Amore fai sempre bene.  L'Amore aiuta a scegliere sempre il bene, e a far s che l'uomo non attiri su di s le cattive conseguenze, e non si autodistrugga.  A causa del peccato origninale, purtroppo, l'uomo  schiavo del peccato e della sua natura malvagia, corrotta dal peccato, che lo porta istinitvamente a preferire azioni malvagie (guardatevi un p in giro...), e anche se pensa di essere libero purtroppo non lo .  Ges ha detto dei futuri credenti "conosceranno la Verit e la Verit li far liberi".  Quindi, per rispondere alla tua domanda, ci sono tre elementi per una piena libert: la conoscenza delle conseguenze (per sapere cosa di decide), l'Amore (per capire cosa  bene per gli altri), e la nostra volont (per mettere in pratica la decisione).

I see some Greek words here but it appears that some words are in Korean (here and there, I'm sure its just a fluke)... can you tell me where these lyrics came from?  They simply don't appear to make a lot of sense for being in Greek, according to my translator.  Then I can give a more appropriate translation.    And as I'm sure I'll get thumbs down marks for this, I must ask: Can you translate this?      Heres what I was able to do, thanks to my translator:      We passed very well;  We enjoyed each other;  But suddenly you say to me;  That you want me to marry you.    apapapapaapapapapa  -(?

Costretto per punizione a vivere in grande solitudine, egli ritrova nella comunione col Cristo la forza di riprendere. Ed un particlare significativo:   "E, pur non avendo sulle spalle la croce, aveva partecipato a quell'immane fatica come se il peso fosse stato anche sulle sue  di "Peppone spalle". Il sacerdote in questa condivisione della Via Crucis porta con s anche gli altri.  Vorrei concludere con una riflessione fatta da Don Camillo     "A me basta sempre quello che Dio mi concede. Se Dio mi porge il dito non gli afferro la mano ? Per qualche volta vorrei afferrargliela".      la sintesi della sapienza cristiana ed umana: sapere che non si  mai soli ed essere contenti di questa compagnia che Dio dona sempre alla sua creatura  senza volergli afferrare noi la sua mano, ma lasciando che sia la sua mano ed afferrare la nostra.--------Attenti ai cosiddetti - preti!!!Ih Ihi
ad71813bbf196339590356e53d257e3aaa	Penso proprio che tu ci abbia azzeccato, non dico in pieno, ma quasi!  Molti non lo fanno pi per vocazione, probabilmente per qualcosa che gli assomiglia. La situazione  simile a coloro che non sono in grado di distinguere il vero amore per una persona a cui dedicare la propria vita sponsandosela, e cos scambiano l'amore con la passione; non si prendono il tempo necessario per conoscersi e infine, quando gli occhiali rosa o improsciuttati, decadono, eccoti un matrimonio sfasciato. E' una delle ragioni per cui questo accade di sovente. Con le convivenze la situazione non cambia di molto.    In seminario v' una sorta di innamoramento per la spiritualit che non ha come base lo spirito divino, solo che non ci si rende conto.     Una volta ordinato, la vita del sacerdote, spesso, diviene un mestiere, e quindi la devozione pu gradualmente assopirsi lasciando talvolta solo il senso del dovere.   A questo punto la castit diviene frustrante e semmai qualcosa di strano non lo si  riuscito a debellare, sessualmente parlando, allora pu essere un guaio. In tutta segretezza i preti di una volta circuivano suore o parrocchiane; poco importava se queste ultime fossero sposate.  (quanto alle molte suore che sono 'cadute', vittime o no, se la polizia indagherebbe, chiss quanti cimiteri si scoprirebbero, con seppellite piccole carcasse di innocenti)     Poi c' stata la volta dei preti pederasti!   Col tempo sono caduti sempre pi in basso e dunque la segretezza e divenuta meno trincerata per la gravit di molti atti.   Un tempo ci si rideva sopra quando le vittime erano solo donne, ma ora, a fronte di una tal piaga come quella della pedofilia sacerdotale, c' poco da scherzare.  Molto ha influito, il celibato imposto dalla chiesa, che tra l'altro non ha alcun riscontro biblico semmai il contrario [ "Comunque, lespressione ispirata dice esplicitamente che in successivi periodi di tempo alcuni si allontaneranno dalla fede, prestando attenzione a ingannevoli espressioni ispirate e a insegnamenti di demoni, mediante lipocrisia di uomini che diranno menzogne, segnati nella loro coscienza come da un ferro rovente;?I QUALI PROIBIRANNO DI SPOSARSI, comandando di astenersi da cibi che Dio ha creato.. 1Timoteo 4:1-3" ].     Quei pochi che si sono piegati a una vera vocazione, in paragone alla  stragrande maggioranza dei loro confratelli, sono 'dispersi' nelle non poche missioni africane e non, a rischio della propria vita. Quel ch' peggio, ogni tanto,  che qualcuno tra quelli, paga con la morte (un sincero prete anche a Roma)la 'leggerezza' di qualcuno che occupa posti in vaticano o in qualche comoda parrocchia italiana o di qualche altra nazione europea, e meglio ancora, degli Stati Uniti.    E' per essersi espresso con leggerezza che l'attuale gran sacerdote del cattolicesimo  stato causa dell'uccisione di una brava e simpatica suora missionaria. La pedofila  la causa principale dell'odio versato contro tutti quei preti che hanno scelto di vivere pur fra tante grosse difficolt. Difficile non credere che siano stati spinti da vera vocazione.      Gli abusi sessuali tra le mura ecclesiastiche, come di certi collegi, davvero non si contano. Per risolvere il 'problema' la chiesa si  inventato una sorta di documento segreto: il "CRIMEN SOLLICITATIONIS"!    A lei ogni opportuna ricerca.

Mi pare proprio di si. Che questa sia correlata col credo non mi pare... Potrebbe effettivamente essere il risultato della repressione causata dal voto di castit, ma allora dovremmo presuppore che tutti gli individui maschi senza una attivit sessuale diventino pedofili. Il che di solito non . Probabilmente i casi tra il clero rientrano nella media dei casi di pedofilia in generale, che non sono pochi. La differenza  che quando capita a un "laico" di solito si invoca la forca, quando capita a un clericale di solito si chiede di fare chiarezza. Sono d'accordo con Luigi, non si pu accusare un intera categoria. Allo stesso modo non si pu assumere a priori che la medesima categoria abbia diritto a maggiori garanzie.   Per quanto riguarda l'omosessualit nei conventi o pratiche poco ortodosse... un qualsiasi sguardo ai materiali dell'inquisizione pu dare un interessante idea del fenomeno,

Mi sembra una situazione da Grande fratello, o da Matrix, dove dietro c' qualcuno che ti controlla , che ti da una finta realt in cui vivere per assicurarsi quanto meno che tu non abbia la forza di alzare la testa, applicando con successo il modello del bastone e della carota.  Ci siamo dentro fino al collo. E c' chi fa la ola.    Io ne ho piene le scatole di questo, e mi ribello come posso.  Ma ci vorrebbe una rivoluzione, o un Zapatero disponibile a cambiare le cose.|`|ZGdM8b0raa	no questa non  realt virtuale ma pura e cruda realt reale|`|YDIVuN8faa	Da un tipo di informazione disinformata come abbiamo in Italia, l'unica cosa importante  creare ad arte trasmissioni inutili (perch non ce ne sono abbastanza) condotte da persone inutili che campano sulle disgrazie altrui.

AA10146893	It's a tough language to learn how to speak ( coming from parents who are Polish and speak that with me).    The best way would be to be in contact with someone who knows how to speak it. That way they can correct your accent.    See if you can find out what kind of school books they use in school and order a couple. Start with whatever grade you feel most comfortable.    It helps if you have contact with Polish people. If you are in New York, then in Brooklyn in Greenpoint there is a Polish neighborhood that has books from Poland, you could find some there.  Or see if there is some Polish comunity that you can join where you live.|`|2577f0992ce02aa0bade7b777b040d17aa	Enjoy learning just one new word or a new phrase each day; do not push too hard, laugh at your mistakes and reward yourself for even a small success--each step counts, for it brings you closer to your goal--expressing yourself clearly in a new language--  http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2982314  http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Polish_...

Le lacrime appartengono a tutti uomini e donne.  Chi non  capace di piangere non ha un cuore ma una pietra.  Il pianto  uno stato permesso alle donne ma negato agli uomini. Ci sembra pi naturale vedere per strada una donna che piange piuttosto di un uomo in lacrime.  Tutti si aspettano che gli uomini non debbano piangere mai o quasi, e per questo che spesso noi maschi abbiamo vita difficile.  Ci  concesso piangere per eventi tragici, ma niente di pi.  Le donne al contrario possono lacrimare ogni volta che vogliono: in solitudine, davanti alle amiche, ai genitori o al proprio uomo. Le lacrime sono per loro un potente meccanismo di difesa.  Personalmente non penso che il pianto degli uomini sia segno di debolezza, anche se ci  stato insegnato sin da piccoli che non  una cosa virile.  Anzi penso che le lacrime degli uomini sono molto pi preziose di quelle delle donne, proprio perch rare.  Ciao|`|d4fe57802415ed8ba7e0e3a5d077ec84aa	fino a quando ci sar la convinzione che l'uomo forte non piange ma deve essere duro...e non fare trasparire i propri sentimenti purtroppo saranno sempre pi rare.....l'uomo vero secondo me  colui che prende atto dei proprio sentimenti e li esterna come vuole......ciao|`|Hi4aLGDkaa	piangere significa essere uomo...altrimenti significherebbe non essere...|`|lg8VWo7daa	Le lacrime di un uomo sono difficili da capire. Ecco perch piango in solitudine e non voglio farmi vedere. Le nostre lacrime sono spesso fraintese ma non  giusto somatizzare tutto il male o tutta la gioia. Per noi piangere in presenza dell'altro sesso  difficile ma come vorrei ricevere una carezza anzich uno sguardo di stupore, non lo accetto soprattutto dalla donna che secondo me ha una sensibilit maggiore dell'uomo. Continuer a piangere in disparte fino a che non trover veramente chi le capir. Saranno momenti difficili ma non mi spaventano. Siamo umani anche noi.|`|2a81769bd712038f2211aac28a4106edaa	Sembra che solo un uomo che piange sia veramente sincero...o sensibile... o tante altre belle cose dette finora...    io per devo dire che, sono stato arrabbiato, commosso, felice, distrutto, triste, tutte emozioni che possono portare al pianto, per mille motivi diversi...    ma io non ho mai pianto, e non per questo credo di essere insensible o non sincero nei miei sentimenti.     SONO UN EXTRATERRESTRE?    ciao ciao|`|wEgG70v9aa	credo che la debolezza sia piu' maschile che femminile. un uomo piange quando non sa usare la violenza!

In realt, e per fortuna, uomini e donne sono molto pi simili di quanto non si creda, soprattutto quando si tratta di emozioni. Perch mai un uomo non dovrebbe piangere, se ne sente il bisogno? E' liberatorio anche per lui e, di certo, non lo rende meno "maschio".|`|uofIVdZlaa	Bh... la verit!!Oppure ha ormoni femminili...Squilibrio ormonale secondo me!|`|ZllDMU90aa	perch siamo stati socializzati a pensare all'uomo come uno che deve tenersi tutto dentro e non dimostrare le proprie fragilit...  hai presente la classica frase detta ai maschietti "non piangere, non fare la femminuccia"?  secondo me da comportamenti banali e facilmente evitabili come questo passano le basi per le prime differenze di genere..  una delle poche cose per cui son contenta di essere donna e di non dovermi vergognare quando mi commuovo o ho voglia di piangere!|`|UtgaEf8waa	L'uomo che piange  cmq un uomo...piangere  normale.

La donna invece piange molto, si commuove pi facilmente anche se non proprio tutte. Per quasi sempre  la donna a piangere e l'uomo invece quasi mai. Ma penso che un uomo anche se non piange si tiene tutto dentro e soffre comunque senza farlo vedere xch non vuole. Ad un altro uomo pu venire spontaneo piangere molto o meno. Oppure non piange quasi mai o anke mai perch qualcuno  meno sensibile.|`|feddc782708ffbf1998ec00acd15f9b3aa	la commozione quando  reale va sempre rispettata       ho visto alcuni uomini piangere  penso che l'atto del piangere(ripeto se  sincero)  significa esprimere qualcosa in quel determinato momento     nonostante anche io come te  difficilmente mi commuovo    per me la debolezza di una persona non si vede dalle lacrime che versa  ma da altro(insicurezza,pregiudizio  ,ignoranza,critica gratuita,ipocrisia ecc)  ripeto pero' dipende sempre dal tipo di pianto  per esempio non mi piacciono le persone che sia in senso figurato che non  si piangono addosso per qualunque cosa(forse per questo che io piango poco:)))    e comunque non ritengo un uomo che piange,un uomo debole|`|z9RaCaW5aa	Le lacrime vere,le lacrime sospirate sono dolorose per qualsiasi persona...Non  debolezza...Chi piange deve essere rispettato.....Non c' cosa pi difficile di piangere....lo si fa perch qualcosa ci ha fatto male....|`|LWQxi2sAaa	Non  sinonimo di debolezza piangere.

Leggiti questa parabola e capirai:    Introduzione mia:  -  Giuda Iscariota, capostipite di tutti coloro che strumentalizzano i poveri, lo aveva ben detto a Ges, ma sentite la risposta (e meditate, a voi che dei poveri non ve ne frega una mazza come il vostro capostipite):      Maria allora, presa una libbra di olio profumato di vero nardo, assai prezioso, cosparse i piedi di Ges e li asciug con i suoi capelli, e tutta la casa si riemp del profumo dell'unguento. Allora Giuda Iscariota, uno dei suoi discepoli, che doveva poi tradirlo, disse: ?Perch quest'olio profumato non si  venduto per trecento denari per poi darli ai poveri??. Questo egli disse NON PERCHE GLI INTERESSASSE DEI POVERI, ma perch era ladro e, siccome teneva la cassa, prendeva quello che vi mettevano dentro. Ges allora disse: ?Lasciala fare, perch lo conservi per il giorno della mia sepoltura. I poveri infatti li avete sempre con voi, ma non sempre avete me?.

Un p come noi Occidentali che per mantenere il nostro standard di opulenza teniamo povero il Sud del mondo, perch ridistribuire le nostre ricchezze e risorse vorrebbe dire impoverire il nostro standard.

Io credo che un cattolico abbia il dovere di guardare all'insegnamento sociale della Chiesa Cattolica come puntodi riferimento per le sue meditazioni e da questo aprire un contraddittorio con tutte le realt politiche, lottando per la difesa dell'ecologia umana e ambientale.  ciao e buona vita|`|9bd483ed26228f2d38b057882dbdfe6eaa	non ci vedo proprio nulla di strano.

Ora, io non sono credente ma non riesco proprio a vedere qualcosa di cristiano -nel senso di riferentesi alla dottrina di cristo, il quale predicava la fratellanza - nell'inviare -e non certo per amicizia -una nave da guerra perfettamente armata contro un barcone di poveracci.

a3d9ce99330ad25bd55dcd73b83d3649aa	Mi fa tristezza vedere questo continuo palleggiare di domande e risposte piu' o meno inconcludenti tra credenti e atei.  E' noto ormai da secoli, anzi da millenni, che l'esistenza o la non-esistenza di Dio non si puo' dimostrare. La fede, o la si ha o non la si ha, e' un po' come l'amore, se non ami una persona non potrai mai farti venire l'amore artificialmente. Ma mi fa anche tristezza vedere risposte del tutto ignare della Storia, come quello che ha risposto che il Cristianesimo si e' imposto con le guerre.... ragazzo, studia la Storia! I primi Cristiani, quelli che hanno diffuso il Cristianesimo in tutto l'Impero Romano, erano armati solo della loro fede e del loro amore....le guerre, se mai, sono arrivate dopo!  E permettetemi di dire che rabbrividisco quando leggo risposte del tipo: io credo solo in me stesso.  In un universo immenso e sconfinato, con migliaia di fenomeni e misteri ancora da scoprire e governato da forze che superano ogni possibilita' di controllo (pensate solo ai terremoti e agli uragani!) come fai tu, povero ragazzetto, a "credere solo in te stesso"? Possibile che tu non venga nemmeno sfiorato dal dubbio che dietro tutto cio' ci sia qualcosa di piu' grande, e non solo il  caso o gli atomi impazziti?|`|87199a0a226e5e0f28535e6e4467d796aa	io non l'ho mai visto... non ho mai visto miracoli... ho visto solo sofferenza e errori umani...|`|173c87506a94ff6be690fab5904ce228aa	Dici che non hai bisogno di dimostrarne l'esistenza perch ti basta la fede, bene, io non ho bisogno di dimostrare che non esiste, mi basta non avere la fede....|`|136d50811b54ffec5dd57da0e1ad04f3aa	L'uomo che sa usare la ragione al massimo grado, non pu sentire il bisogno di Dio, perch  assolutamente irrazionale sentire necessit di una cosa di cui non si sa nulla, e di cui  impossibile riuscire a sapere alcunch, di un'entit che gli stessi fedeli definiscono inimmaginabile, incomprensibile,inconoscibile. L'ostinarsi  a ricercare Dio non fa altro che perpetuare nell'uomo la speranza di poterlo un giorno trovare, speranza che sar sicuramente delusa, giacch l'uomo non  ha e non potr mai avere alcuna facolt atta a percepire l'immateriale, l'inconoscibile e l'assoluto. Dio  un quid semplicemente, e un quid razionalmente, pu essere tutto e il contrario di tutto. Sono necessari dunque  molteplici fattori per poter affermare la sua esistenza ed altrettanti per negarla, poich la negazione  una certezza cos come lo  un'affermazione e quindi necessita delle stesse prove di cui necessita ogni certezza per essere ritenuta tale. solo Dio pu risolvere il problema Dio.|`|4a82252f380573f92eb2ac8bdbd8b46baa	Anche all'ateo basta la fede per dimostrare l'inesistenza di Dio, la fede nella sua inesistenza, proprio come il credente crede nella sua esistenza.

Non posso dimostrarti con la ragione la non esistenza di Dio, cos come tu non puoi dimostrarmi che non esista un pianeta rosa che orbita intorno ad Vega.  Questo non implica automaticamente che Dio, o il pianeta, esistano davvero.      O per restare in ambito religioso:  a quale Dio ti riferisci?  Se, come penso,  quello tella tradizione cristiana, io potrei chiederti di dimostrarmi invece la non esistenza di Manit.  Siccome non puoi, non puoi neanche non dubitare sull'esattezza del tuo non credere in Manit.  Non ti sembra che ci sia qualcsa che non va in questo ragionamento?|`|b1126c2142c85847d0ebc69b0032e01eaa	non dubium est quin et l'esse est et non esse non est  tutto ci per dirti che questi ragionamenti non dimostrano molto n dall'una n dall'altra parte...si crede per fede e basta e la fede non deve essere dimostrata per lasciamo in pace gli atei|`|e56fd11497c733a90b9c97b216239c2caa	Con la ragione, mio caro, non dimostri proprio niente.  Con la ragione puoi argomentare teorie a sotegno di una tesi o dell'altra, e siccome per ogni tesi puoi speculare un'antitesi, l'argomentazione in se stessa non dimostra altro che ci possono essere buoni motivi a sostegno dell'uno o dell'altro punto di vista.  Per dimostrare l'esistenza di un fenomeno, bisogna portarne le prove e che siano solide ed inconfutabili.  Diciamo che tentare di dimostrare la non esistenza di Dio senza che nessuno ne abbia mai dimostrato l'esistenza,  inutile, in quanto il fenomeno che non viene rilevato  di per se stesso inesistente.  Puoi farne una questione di fede e tentare di dimostrare che la tua fede  superiore a quella di un ateo, ma se uno  ateo, perch dovrebbe discutere di un non problema?|`|f402c72ec65f49566728718ee6568244aa	Personalmente sono credente, ma davvero perch mi dovrebbe dimostrare l' ateo, una cosa che io stessa, non posso fare (in quanto credente).

Che ne dite se ci rivolgiamo ai sindacati e chiediamo di ridurla a 4 ?|`|ad6559518ee7ea2663bbb774b8106390aa	La fede e' un sentimento che esiste quando non c'e' l'assoluta sicurezza che un fatto sia vero o falso.  Se un fatto e' vero e dimostrabile, la fede recede e diventa inutile.  E' come ogni altra emozione.  Uno desidera comprasi un'automobile.  Lavora, si mette da parte i soldi e raggiunge il suo scopo.  Quando il desiderio dell'auto e' soddisfatto, quel desiderio sparisce.  La speranza e' lo stesso.  Uno spera d'incontrarsi con la persona amata.  Quando s'incontra, il sentimento di speranza non ha piu' motivo di farsi sentire.  La fede esiste finche' non abbiamo prove dell'esistenza o della non esistenza di un fatto.      Dichiararsi sicuri al cento per cento che Dio esiste solo basandosi sulla fede potrebbe creare un problema con la ragione quando si deve prendere una decisione importante.  A meno che non lo si dica tanto per dire.  Sicurezza assoluta vuol dire non solo pensare di aver fede ma agire secondo la fede che abbiamo, altrimenti a che cosa serve?  Un esempio di chi ha fede al cento per cento e' quello dei 19 terroristi.  Dio gli parlo', e gli disse, "Impossessatevi di aerei e schiantateli contro le torri gemelle.  Uccidete quanti piu' infedeli potete e sarete premiati in Cielo."  Essendo assolutamente certi della loro fede al cento per cento, hanno messo in pratica la loro fede e hanno messo da parte qualsiasi altra considerazione razionale.  Non si sono nemmeno potuti chiedere se quel Dio veramente esistesse, la fede glielo proibisce.      Chi dice di essere sicuro che il suo Dio esiste lo dice perche' il suo Dio non lo mette a nessuna prova importante.  Se dovesse scegliere tra fede e ragione consistentemente, probabilmente non potrebbe rimanere in vita per molto.  Nel raccontino bibblico di Abramo, Dio gli parlo' e gli disse di uccidere suo figlio.  Egli dovette decidere tra ragione e fede.  Scelse la fede. Ma per fortuna Dio cambio' idea e intravenne.    Ma quando mai la fede ti aiuta a traversare la strada senza guardare?  Quando mai la fede aiuta una nazione contro un'altra a vincere una guerra?  Ad ottenere un lavoro ambito?  Se uno ha la fede in Dio al cento per cento, dove sono le decisioni rilevanti che fa nella vita per mettere la fede in pratica?     L'unica cosa che la fede puo' fare in pratica, che la ragione non puo', e' usarla come mezzo di specializzazione professionale e fare carriera come prete, monaco, vescovo, eccetera.  Tutte professioni altamente accademiche ed intellettualmente inutili.    Non aver fede in Dio e' semplicemente aver constatato che la fede non ha nessuna applicazione pratica.  In realta', quello su cui tutte le persone mature basano le loro decisioni, non e' mai la fede, ma la ragione.  In fatti, anche per aver fede uno deve usare la ragione, perche' deve analizzare prima se quello che gli viene detto risponde in qualche modo, anche illogico, a come egli s'immagina concetti importanti come giustizia, amore, conoscenza, protezione, onesta', compassione eccetera entrino a coesistere nel suo sistema di fede.      Il fatto che il Dio in cui tu hai fede dica alcune cose ovvie in forma di comandamento, come "Non uccidere" non e' una scoperta divina e particolarmente profonda da seguire per fede.  Infatti, come dogma, potrebbe anche essere ingiusto non uccidere, perche' ci sono circostanze in cui uccidere un mostro e salvare un bambino in procinto di essere torturarto e' quello che la ragione dice di scegliere, e che la fede come dogma serve solo a confondere le idee.    An ateo non dice io ho prova che Dio non esiste, come tu non puoi dire che hai prova che da qualche parte ci sono asini volanti.  Ma magari tu hai un dubbio circa l'esistenza degli asini volanti.  In percentuale, quanto credi sia la percentuale che gli asini volanti esistono, 0%, 2%, 50%?  Dove sono le tue prove?    Per ora l'evidenza dei sensi e la logica mette Dio alla stessa probabilita' d'esistenza degli asini volanti.  Nessuno, pero' puo' sapere quello che potrebbe succedere nel futuro, ma e' piu' facile che l'evoluzione della vita su qualche pianeta sviluppi asini volanti invece di una coscienza intelligente e supernaturale, senza corpo fisico, che esiste al di fuori dell'universo, in qualche dimensione sconosciuta, e che s'interessa delle nostre faccende puerili.|`|9c933907f2557e6d169523a6ba599c3faa	Bravo, ma l'onere della prova spetta a chi afferma, non a chi nega, quindi dimostrami prima tu con la ragione l'esistenza di Dio, altrimenti non puoi non dubitare sull'esattezza del tuo credere.  Ciao!    (ulteriori dettagli)  A dire il vero, per quanto ne so io, la mania del proselitismo ce l'hanno sempre avuta i credenti, nessun ateo ha mai cercato di convincermi a non credere.  Comunque non mischiamo tutti gli infedeli in un unico calderone: essere ATEI richiede, analogamente all'essere credenti, una fede nella non-esistenza di Dio, ed  su questa fede che si basa il loro ateismo, appunto perch, come affermi giustamente tu, non  possibile dimostrare che Dio non esiste.   Gli AGNOSTICI invece si basano sulla razionalit, e sostengono che il concetto di Dio  talmente inconoscibile (a-gnothein = non sapere) che non  n dimostrabile n smentibile con la ragione, e che quando si tenta di farlo si cade irrimediabilmente in contraddizione.    Quindi capisci benissimo che non puoi usare la ragione per convincere un ateo che si sbaglia, cos come un ateo non pu convincere te razionalmente che sei in errore: l'unica soluzione  aver rispetto per le convinzioni diverse dalle proprie.    Concludo con una battuta di Achille Campanile, che sottolinea simpaticamente quanto sia sorprendentemente sottile, in fin dei conti, la differenza fra credenti e atei:    "Il credente: ?Io sono un credente, signore, afflitto dal dubbio che Dio non esista?. Lateo: ?Io, peggio. Sono un ateo, signore, afflitto dal dubbio che Dio, invece, esista realmente.  terribile?"|`|601506144579f0232f05387b61e97dfbaa	non esiste l'esattezza ne riguardo la sua esistenza o no...  per questo che si parla di "credere"...perch non c' certezza, solo un opinione personale...non avercela con chi non crede,  davvero sbagliato pretendere che gli altri la debbano pensare per forza come te.|`|bbea2bfe156da579852b448c89300703aa	la stessa domanda pu essere fatta per i credenti, morale meglio lasciare tutti nelle loro convinzioni.|`|cad4f4af65af14ebbcde005215512fc0aa	Per quanto mi riguarda, penso che Ges in quanto persona reale sia veramente esistito.

L'ho sperimentato su me stessa.|`|da7fa48badab560c0e879b65473b3599aa	dimostrami tu l'esistenza del tuo o dei vari dii....|`|220f5d5f68499602a73a5ae785b2443faa	non vuole essere una dimostrazione, ma solo un'osservazione:  applichiamo il principio di ockam (grafia errata sicuramente).      pi facile che esista un essere di cui non si ha alcuna prova fisica, che esisterebbe in non si sa quale dimensione, che dovrebbe essere buono ma che inesplicabilmente lascia che accada ogni male, oppure che un tale essere non esista e l'universo sia governato dalle leggi fisiche, lasciando la morale agli uomini?    normalmente si deve provere che qcs esista e non il contrario, questo chiede la logica.   nel passato non si riusciva ad esempio a dimostrare l'esistenza del  flogisto, una sorta di "flusso energetico" che infatti non esiste.     questo non impedisce che chi ne senta il bisogno non possa appoggiarsi ad una divinit e consegnare dubbi e domande sulla vita e sull'universo (es creazionismo al posto di teorie fisiche o biochimiche) a lui.    e tu come fai ad essere cos sicuro della presenza di qcs di cui non si puo' per definizione provare l'esistenza (se no che distinzione ci sarebbe tra creature e creatore)?  ciao|`|9bd483ed26228f2d38b057882dbdfe6eaa	come ti hanno gi detto, l'onere della prova spetta a chi afferma; quindi  chi crede che deve dimostrare l'esistenza di dio, non chi non crede.  inoltre, tutte le prove dell'esistenza di dio- da quella di Aristotele in avanti - hanno fallito.  le religioni, inoltre, sono accomunate da due fattori: tutte affermano di aver ragione, ma nessuna lo dimostra (  come dire che 2+2 fa contemporaneamente 3, 4,5, 6..).e per dimostrare l'effettiva realt di una cosa non basta dire che sta scritto in un libro: ci vogliono le prove effettive.Che nessuna religione ha mai mostrato.|`|6fa1339415d29c712749ed429cf3d3deaa	Ti dovremmo dimostare la non-esistenza di Dio? Ok , tu dimostracene l'esistenza e io mi converto all'istante , e non lo dico per scherzare , se scoprissi che Dio c' mi farebbe pure piacere , ma se  tanto comprensivo non faticher a capire che non sempre si pu credere a ci che non si vede !|`|7f24a7071fb2f717a7f5c01395ecaa14aa	Purtroppo, e la Storia lo dimostra, il contrasto tra fede e ragione e' inconciliabile.|`|5b430def1fe690d16c556601c1161c7caa	Magari potessi dimostrare che dio non esiste. Io ne ho la certezza dentro di me ma come fare? e perch vuoi essere "convertito"?   Non credo nelle religioni e non credo in nulla che io non riesca a vedere... quindi questa  la prova.. non si  mai visto.|`|a239ddb706f8932cd4fcd42d0b28adf8aa	Il Buddha di fronte alla domanda dell'esistenza di Dio rimase nel suo Nobile Silenzio. Non afferm ne neg Dio.  Questo  l'atteggiamento da tenere se si  raggiunto e relizzato Prajna (ovvero la Saggezza Trascendente non pi solo saggezza umana).|`|ffe77a59afad935e45e2250cfd68df4aaa	Nessun ateo ha la presunzione di non dubitare sul proprio non-credo.  Sono i religiosi che non ammettono dubbi nemmeno in chi non crede. E rompono i kogli0ni.|`|58bb97b52fe4a26a3226064cb4134359aa	Premetto che sono atea ed ho grande rispetto per i credenti di tutte le religioni.    Credo che esistano 2 tipi di fede:  1 la fede che ti insegnano (quando i tuoi genitori ti portano in chiesa, ti fanno fare il chierichetto, ti obbligano a dire il Padre Nostro ai pasti, etc.)  2 la fede vera (ho conosciuto una donna in carriera che, una mattina, e' andata a fare la suora di clausura perche' aveva ricevuto la "chiamata di Dio", ma questo e' un caso estremo)  Questi 2 tipi di fede, ovviamente, riguardano tutte le religioni.  Io non ti posso dimostrare la non esistenza di Dio come tu non puoi dimostrarmene l'esistenza perche' non ci sono formule fisiche o chimiche per sperimentare ed avere risultati tangibili.  L'unica cosa che un credente si deve chiedere e' a quale delle 2 fedi appartiene.    Un ateo, in quanto tale, NON puo' rispondere alla tua domanda perche',non credendo in Dio, non c'e' argomento.    Ho letto le risposte che hai ricevuto e ti dico che se ci fosse rispetto per chi la pensa diversamente, ci sarebbero molti problemi e guerre di meno.    Ciao|`|ef57b48851a1a44f90098d8ab2e5937faa	e tu come puoi dimostrare il contrario sig sapiente?|`|39b2dc016542daf0e33dc398faa205e3aa	infatti essere agnostici  la cosa migliore...anke se, ki nn ci crede ha dimostrazioni scientifiche su tante cose (x esempio sulla creazione dell'universo) mentre ki ci crede ke dimostrazioni ha? la bibbia? troppo poco...|`|cb6bd163bdcad9a7851f1e34e8df50f9aa	Non sono ateo, ma se fai una domanda come questa, secondo me, dovresti prima dimostrarne tu l'esistenza. E poi secondo me con una domanda del genere potresti anche offendere qualcuno, pensaci bene: stai mettendo in dubbio le scelte religiose di altri! Ho conosciuto diversi atei e ti posso assicurare che ce ne sono alcuni migliori di molti credenti.|`|1da1f243404c8bca1851b65f7f5bdf3eaa	che esista o no questa nemmeno  tanto la questione...semplicemente non m'interessa l'argomento, posso vivere bene senza provarmi l'esistenza o no  di un dio.  Non lo includo nella mia vita.|`|abf72864e66fbfeebd04346de0201834aa	non sono ateo    non credo che sia possibile dimostrare la non esistenza di qualcuno o qualcosa che si crede che non esista

hG2DfPoqaa	 un discorso lunghissimo e piuttosto doloroso. Non so precisamente quando sono diventato agnostico, ma in origine ero credente. Poi sono accadute delle cose  difficile da spiegare. Ma ci sono cose che accadono che ti scavano dentro, all'inzio non ti fanno niente ma ogni giorno crescono  e ti presentano il conto. ti fanno domande esigono risposte che non puoi dare. Ti fanno venire a patti con la realt, fanno terra bruciata. E la mente e il corpo cedono. Poi  arrivata la ragione. Pensavo di essere ateo. Ma poi ho scoperto che l'ateismo  una sorta di religione. e ora sono agnostico eternamente sospeso tra ottimismo e pessimismo, tra vita e morte tra luce e ombra. In verit non amo mai parlarne perch certe cose  meglio seppellirle.|`|15307a652e657b963caff04544c3e322aa	Gli atei ti risponderanno vedrai, ma non ti daranno una spiegazione altrettanto convincente di quanto non possa darti chi ha fede.  Anche l'ateismo in fondo  permesso.  Dio  permette tutto, ma vuole che arriviamo a Lui da diverse posizioni, a volte scontrandosi con la negazione assoluta.  L'ateo che si comporta in maniera corretta e magari non atribuendo a Dio le sue opere, svolte con il fine di fare del bene segue i suoi insegnamenti. Non escluderei che un ateo abbia accesso al Suo Regno al posto di un credente che ammette di esserlo a parole e non con i fatti.  Voglio dire che il regno dei Cieli  aperto a tutti coloro che operano nel bene e per il bene sia di loro stessi che dei loro simili. Questo  il comandamento pi importante.  Ciao|`|9bd483ed26228f2d38b057882dbdfe6eaa	Io sono ateo perch tutte le prove sull'esistenza di dio hanno dato esito negativo, nessuno mi ha mai dimostrato con le prove - e non dicendomi che  vero perch sta scritto in un libro - che dio esiste; inoltre, non sono io a dover dimostrare l'esistenza di dio, ma se mai  un credente che dovrebbe farlo, questo per la semplice ragione che l'onere della prova spetta sempre a chi afferma, e gli atei non affermano niente. Lo stesso termine "ateo"  particolarmente strano: infatti,  stato affibbiato ai non credenti da chi invece aveva la fede;  come se io dicessi che chi non crede a Nessie - il mostro che vivrebbe nel celeberrimo lago di Ness, in Scozia - si chiami "a-nessie";  evidentemente assurdo. Chi non crede a nessie non  di certo tenuto a dimostrare che questa creatura esista;  chi ci crede, se mai a doverlo fare.. Prova inoltre a pensare - come sugger l'astrofisico C.Sagan - cosa diresti se io ti dicessi che nel mio garage c' un drago. Tu vieni a vederlo, e non vedi altro che la mia bici, la mia auto, e quelle cose che di solito si trovano dentro un box, ma di draghi, nemmeno l'ombra...allora mi chiedi dove sia, e io ti dico che non puoi vederlo, perch  invisibile. "Bene" - mi dici - "Allora cospargiamo di talco il pavimento del garage per rilevare le sue impronte".."No"-ti rispondo - "non puoi perch il drago  immateriale.. insomma, per farla breve, ad ogni prova che tu richiedi di portare io ti rispondo che non  possibile in alcun modo rilevare la presenza di questo essere, ma che anche se non lo percepisci in alcun modo, esiste. Ora, onestamente, tu crederesti alla mia storia? Al posto tuo, io non ci crederei: non ho dato alcuna prova, del resto. E se ti avessi chiesto di darmi una prova del fatto che il mio drago non esiste, penso che la risposta sarebbe stata che ero io a dover dimostrare la sua esistenza, visto che sono io che ne parlo. Questo esempio si applica benissimo a dio, visto che anche dio  un ente la cui esistenza  presunta da chi ci crede, senza che mai nessuno abbia fornito delle prove.  Per rispondere alla tua ultima domanda  se io fossi favorevole al dialogo in materia  la mia risposta  s, personalmente amo la discussione, e se cos non fosse, non avrei fatto in modo che gli utenti possano contattarmi. Saluti.    P.S: va da s che io amo la discussione, ma di certo non con persone che scrivono questa discutibilissima frase che riporto:    "Per me un ateo  solo una persona vuota che non ammette discussioni e che professa ed espone una "dottrina" pi affermando che provando."    Veramente molto educato....    Chi l'ha scritta, pi che essere senza nome, per me  senza il bench minimo rispetto per gli altri.Oltre ovviamente a scrivere una sciocchezza..chiss con quali parametri mi giudica vuoto..mah...    Io comunque non mi sento una persona vuota:  chi ha scritto questa frase  invece strapieno di arroganza; con gente simile non amo affatto il dialogo.        NOTA: Ritenere che sono gli atei a dover dimostrare la none sistenza di dio non ha senso logico: supponiamo che si affermi: "dio esiste fino a prova contraria.chi non ci crede deve dimostrarlo"  Ora, chi esprime questo concetto non porta le prove di questa tesi, cio del fatto che dio esista,e questo gi non sarebbe corretto.Quindi si contraddice da solo  Poi, una frase del genere assomiglia a:  "Gli abitanti del pianeta Marte esistono: chi non ci crede deve dimostrarmi che non esistono"; se mai sar il contrario...se uno afferma una cosa, la deve dimostrare. l'onere della prova -giova ricordarlo e questa  un'ulteriore dimostrazione - spetta a chi afferma.|`|1563278f5827000553efd3381e54a9d6aa	dio esiste,ma i cattolici o quelli di altre religioni tendono spesso a strumentalizzarlo a propri fini|`|i8YuaBNRaa	Mi sono appena iscritto,  la mia prima risposta :p  cmq per quanto mi riguarda vedo il corso degli eventi da un punto di vista prettamente scientifico nel quale ogni cosa  riconducibile a un processo di causa-effetto  in base a una legge fisica. Penso che la differenza tra credenti e atei sia nell'interpretazione di questi eventi: noi cerchiamo sempre di trovare una risposta razionale a un avvenimento e quindi non abbiamo bisogno di ricondurlo ad un intervento soprannaturale.|`|sODnHu83aa	se esiste un dio, questi non potrebbe rimanere inerte dinanzi alle sciagure che si abbattono sull'umanit.  pensa allo tsunami: uno sta su una spiaggia con le persone a cui vuol bene e dopo un attimo si sveglia in un mare di fango e disperazione.  allora delle due l'una: o dio  (per cos dire) "negligente", oppure non esiste  inoltre per credere ad un dio (qualunque esso sia) ci vuole un ingrediente fondamentale: la fede.  l'unico strumento per superare le mille contraddizioni che comporta l'ammissione dell'esistenza di una divinit  e la fede o ce l'hai oppure no|`|1da1f243404c8bca1851b65f7f5bdf3eaa	Per il semplicissimo motivo che non sento il bisogno di credere , di credere ad una forza superiore, a qualcosa d'intangibile ...ad un dio... . Non trovo la mia forza nella religione , nella fede e tantomeno quello che cerco.    ciao|`|a1fb5b37a0bc6248eb3ec444e77ca65daa	Essere ateo vuol dire essere dogmatico, perch l'ateo presume d'avere la Verit Assoluta per negare l'esistenza di Dio.  Negare l'esistenza di Dio  possibile solo con il possesso della Verit Assoluta e nessuno ha avuto, ha ora e mai avr tale Verit, tra l'altro  impossibile averla per irragiungibilit e non per inesistenza della stessa.  Per me un ateo  solo una persona vuota che non ammette discussioni e che professa ed espone una "dottrina" pi affermando che provando.|`|Fz01RfbZaa	Preferisco pensare che dio non esista piuttosto che pensare che esiste e permette tutti gli orrori che vediamo attorno a noi.    Detto questo, non sono propriamente "ateo", nel senso che ritengo esista qualche sorta di "realt superiore" o di "forza vitale" che si potrebbe chiamare anima o simili; per non ritengo che ci sia un essere cosciente "superiore" (quello che comunemente viene chiamato "dio") n tantomeno che sia "buono" o "da ringraziare" o "da adorare" (tantomeno!!!!!) come fanno le religioni. dopotutto, anche se lui fosse dio, che motivo avrei per adorarlo? Al limite, se tutto andasse bene e non solo a me ,ma a tutti, se non ci fosse il sarcoma, la diarrea, il mal di denti, il cancro infantile etc, potrei ringraziarlo ma non certo adorare, che  un'idea malata estrapolata da un'idea gerarchica di societ che non mi appartiene...come si dice, la religione che uno pratica  lo specchio pi fedele dell'idea che uno ha della societ....io sono per i rapporti paritari e non gerarchici! ciao|`|3563d579abd2af06ae15b992332b0706aa	quello che ha scritto IMOOTO_SAN  esattamente quello che penso anche io non potevo esprimere meglio di cos il mio modo di vedere la questione quindi quoto il suo scritto bravo!!!|`|0mCwB2PTaa	aaaaaaaaa e cheguevara82 hanno toccato i punti chiave. Io sono a un passo dall'essere ateo appunto perche' nelle religioni vedo molta incoerenza. Ognuno si fa le regole per conto suo e questo dio non mi pare cosi' perfetto. Diro' una boiata ma un essere perfetto teoricamente dovrebbe essere universale, dovrebbe andare bene per tutti, se dio tende al bene significa che e' di parte e se qualcuno dubita di lui significa che tanto perfetto non e' (per chi potrebbe dire "per me e' perfetto", ogni uomo ha il suo personale modello di perfezione, che non vale per tutti). Se c'e' un dio e' semplicemente un entita' al di sopra dell'uomo, niente di divino, di perfetto o chissa che.  I testi sacri??? Scritti da uomini (quindi non sono opere divine), sono novelle per dare delle dritte all'umanita'.|`|WW1DRNEbaa	io non credo in dio x il semplice fatto che credo nella scienza, ho letto una parte della bibbia e man mano che leggevo credevo sempre pi alle mie idee. dio  l'invenzione dell'uomo che ha paura della morte...le leggi di dio sono in parte leggi etiche in parte leggi fasciste (vedi La misteriosa fiamma della principessa Loana, Umberto Eco pp.340-343). rispettare gli altri, aiutare i deboli, amare il prossimo, non rubare, non uccidere sono cose eticamente corrette, non c' bisogno che te lo dica dio, non credo che se nessuno ti avesse parlato di dio ti saresti messo ad uccidere e a fregartene di chi sta male no?  onora il padre e la madre  una legge fascista sai cosa significa..."rispetta le idee degli anziani ossia non ti opporre alla tradizione, non pretendere di cambiare il modo di vivere della trib" (u. Eco p. 341). quanto  corretto tutto ci?  le persone sane di mente non hanno bisogno di un dio che gli indichi come deve comportarsi, madre teresa di calcutta  una santa non perch agiva nel nome di dio ma perch agiva x il bene. con tutto che sono atea credo nei santi, nei santi terreni per, in quegli uomini che si spaccano il c....x amore dei deboli. i santi terreni sono ovunque...in africa, in india nelle mense x poveri...ma sono qui sulla terra.  dio  solo paura, paura che la vita sia tutta qui, paura che le nostre buone azioni non vegano ricompensate, paura che le ingiustizie subite rimangano impunite....questo  dio.    rispondo alla tua aggiunta. non nego l'esistenza di cristo...credo che questo uomo meraviglioso sia nato x aiutare gli altri a migliorare, che poi lo ha fatto in nome di dio questo  un altro paio di maniche, gli uomini a cui si rivolgeva avevano bisogno di credere che fosse stato mandato da un dio che prometeva la salvezza eterna altrimenti chi si sarebbe opposto ai potenti per pura gloria terrena. onorare i genitori come dici tu  giusto,  etico ma rispettarli in tutte le loro decisioni, in quello che loro scelgono x te(come spesso i preti ti fanno credere che deve essere)  un gran cazzata,  impedire l'evoluzione, la scoperta, il miglioramento.    ah e poi voglio dirti, certo che era rivoluzionario il pensiero di cristo...ma infati cristo  stato un grande rivoluzionario, terreno.   ps sto guardando l'ultima tentazione di cristo di M. scorsese, gran bel film lo consiglio a tutti, atei e credenti di ogni religione.|`|RhY3qdtRaa	io sono atea il motivo  che c' l'ho sempre avuta con Dio perch si  portato via troppe persone da me..  2.  che  In molti hanno provato a dimostrare l'esistenza di Dio ma nessuno l'ha dimostrato  3. eliminare la religione in quanto illusoria felicit delle persone vuol dire esigere  felicit reale  4. credo che tutte le religioni siano false|`|ijnVHlYdaa	Io non ho mai avuto la prova che Dio esiste, almeno il Dio confessionale (non so se mi sono spiegata). Io vedo solo che nel suo nome avvengono e sono avvenute le peggiori catastrofi...e lui non  mai intervenuto... I credenti, in questo caso, rispondono che c' un disegno, il disegno di Dio appunto che noi non possiamo capire....  Allora crede in Dio solo chi ha fede; Dio  un  concetto che non pu essere razionalizzato...Io non ho fede e non c' niente, proprio niente, che mi spinge ad approfondire l'argomento specialmente in questo mio momento particolare in cui speravo che Dio intervenisse aiutando una persona che ha vissuto tutta la sua vita per lui...e invece...mah, rientrer nel  suo disegno...E questa frase io l'ho utilizzata proprio per aiutare questa persona che ne ha ricevuto beneficio. Beato chi ha fede, trova una risposta a tutto...ma io preferisco rimanere nel razionale.  Ti ringrazio per questa domanda che mi ha permesso di sfogarmi!|`|38b4c0c277fabd48943e06508a3b45ccaa	1. Non riesco a materializzare nella mente un essere o entit da pregare.    2. Una vita di un bambino non ha prezzo, la sofferenza di un genitore anche. Quale Dio buono e giusto permetterebbe questo ?     3. I problemi se non vengono affrontati non vengono risolti|`|Ljeqo3rkaa	posso farti a mia volta una domanda? cosa intendi per ateo?  perch il termine ateo indica chi non crede in un dio, per molto spesso viene indicato come ateo chi genericamente non aderisce al cattolicesimo.  personalmente io non mi ritengo atea, per non seguo alcuna religione...  infatti io non nego l'esistenza di un "qualcosa di superiore" (che per alcuni pu chiamarsi Dio o Allah, e per altri destino o fato), che non sia per necessariamente nostra origine o nostro signore (nel senso letterale del termine), e credo anche che negli uomini ci sia qualcosa di pi di un'accozzaglia di cellule che lavorano insieme.  Non apprezzo per le religioni come il cattolicesimo perch penso che una fede debba essere coltivata "dentro". Non ha senso non uccidere perch si teme l'inferno, non si deve uccidere perch lo si ritiene sbagliato. Inoltre non apprezzo che si utilizzi un potere spirituale per condizionare le persone, e anche nella storia della chiesa cattolica direi che esempi del genere ce ne sono abbastanza...  quindi, almeno nel mio caso, non si pu parlare di "ateismo", ma semplicemente di non aderenza a nessuna religione riconosciuta come tale.   valida come risposta alla tua domanda?  =D|`|yspj6fClaa	Se per ateo intendi chi non crede nell'esistenza di Dio si pone allora un problema per voi. Definiamo prima cosa intendi per Dio. Il barbone cattivo che lancia fulmini a destra e a manca. Oppure l'entit principio di tutte cose (a cui io credo e quindi non sono ateo). O forse dovrei credere nel Dio delle religioni o per te a quello dei cattolici. Ebbene a quest'ultimo non credo, quindi sono ateo.  Come vedi si pu essere tutti e due. Pace e bene.  Cambia metodo.|`|866a46e62ddf9c26732be873ef09e2f0aa	Vedi, io non credo a molte cose ma ne credo altre:  1) Non credo alla materia cosa a una cosa inferiore tanto pi che  l'unica cosa che vedo, e penso che la si veda cos perch contiene la morte di cui si aha paura.  2) Non credo che Madre Natura, cio la materia, sia stata creata da qualcuno che sta per aria e ne ha fatto il suo giocattolo.  3) Non credo che Madre Natura sia stupida se  capace di creare tante cose stupende nonch esseri intelligenti come noi.  Invece credo che:  1) La Natura sia divina, che abbia grande intelligenza e che abbia lei stessa le sue regole, cio nulla si crea e nulla si distrugge ma tutto si trasforma.   2) Che non  detto che non vi siano infinit di creature similumane nel cosmo, e che magari questo non sia l'unico cosmo possibile.  3) Credo che l'uomo abbia rifiutato la divinit della Natura perch questo lo conduceva all'idea della morte, visto che sulla terra tutto muore.  4) Credo che 25.000 anni di matriarcato avessero capito qualcosa, visto che adoravano la Madre Terra e aspetti di essa, e che 5.000 anni di patriarcato abbiano portato un'inflazione mentale per cui l'uomo si  "mentalmente" posto al centro dell'universo, al centro degli animali e al centro di un Dio che per "benevolenza" lo sottopone a dure prove ma gli promette la vita dopo la morte in forma di nuvoletta invisibile.    Non posso fartelo capire, per comprenderlo da solo dovresti mettere da parte la tua mente e far uscire il tuo cuore, ma pochi riescono a farlo e quei pochi scoprono la stessa cosa. Ma la Via dello Spirito  dura, molto pi dura dell'accontentare i capricci del tuo Dio, perch questo ti assicura la sopravvivenza, mentre la Via ti stronca ogni illusione. Chi oserebbe tanto? Per ti d la serenit e la lucidit, nonch il premio pi ambito: la libert, che nessun religioso ha.  Come devo definirmi credente o atea? Dieri nessuno dei due, perch credo solo a ci che sperimento.|`|1bd923f06c9cde1cc57ee684b51c2faaaa	io non nego l'esistenza di un'entit superiore che pu essere chiamato come volete, cmq Dio.  Ho molte perplessit su quelle che sono le sovrastrutture , tutto quello che intorno a questa idea di Entit superiore si crea e ci allontana da essa... se potessi amare Dio direttamente senza manipolazioni mi piacerebbe senza sfruttare la religione per fini politici, senza creare tab, senza mettere sulla bocca di Dio cose che magari non ha neanche lontanamente pensato... non sono contro la chiesa di fatto guardando Lo Stato Pontificio nei secoli lo trovo molto umano (nel senso buono insomma  veramente cattivo) , a tratti lontano da Dio. Il vangelo che ci viene insegnato  "taroccato" nel senso, non vero, ma limitato a quello che la chiesa vuol trasmetterci, tagliato, ritagliato, etc etc  Credo in E=mc2 dalla masse scaturisce energia per cui il nostro corpo che  massa materia una volta persa la vita diventa, si sprigiona, energia che si riunisce ad un'unica fonte... Dio?  di sicuro anelo a qualcosa di superiore ma non trovo nella chiesa l'indicazione ....|`|S9KLx5C2aa	Perche' mi resi conto che tutti i problemi non venivano risolti se andavo o meno in chiesa, dovevo comunque arrangiarmi, e poi sono per la scienza, per le cose reali.

Anche un credente alla fine di una discussione, dovr rispondere con un sillogismo.  .   Non vado in giro a predicare che non esista, non voglio convincere nessuno, figurati che nemmeno io sono convinto. Ma se esiste un qualcosa, un'entit al di sopra, nell'universo, e di questo sono convinto, non corrisponde a tutto quello che ne dicono le varie religioni. Non sta l, a giudicare, a punire, a premiare, un Dio,  che vuole o non vuole ascoltare le preghiere e che si comporta come fosse un essere umano.   Se esiste, secondo te, da cosa sarebbe nato? Se  onnipotente perch si  servito della moglie del povero Giuseppe, invece di fare come con Adamo ed Eva? Se conosci  spiegazioni logiche, non dogmatiche, fammi sapere.

mTnhjExDaa	Grande Fabrizia.  Aggiungo solo una riflessione che ho fatto ieri alla notizia. La chiesa che condanna ogni tre per due la chiesa ora era a favore dei progressi scinetifici che permettono di mantenere in vita un corpo che, se fosse solo per la volont di dio che tanto auspicano, sarebbe gi morto da tempo. E' ipocrisia bella e buona.  Penso che, chiedessimo a chiunque, nessuno vorrebbe vivere in quello stato perhc NON E' VIVERE. E allora ben venga anche il clamore mediatico (di cui penso la famiglia avrebbe fatto veramente a meno) se si potesse arrivare finalmente al testamento biologico. E che ognuno faccia la sua scelta.

Non presenta particolari problemi interpretativi al di l di quanto si pu dire per il dolo in generale, tant' che la figura stessa del dolo nella parte generale del codice risente proprio delle elaborazioni dottrinali in materia d'omicidio.    L'istigazione o aiuto al suicidio  un reato previsto dal nostro Codice Penale tramite l'articolo 580, che recita:  ? Chiunque determina altri al suicidio o rafforza l'altrui proposito di suicidio, ovvero ne agevola in qualsiasi modo l'esecuzione,  punito, se il suicidio avviene, con la reclusione da cinque a dodici anni. Se il suicidio non avviene,  punito con la reclusione da uno a cinque anni, sempre che dal tentativo di suicidio derivi una lesione personale grave o gravissima. Le pene sono aumentate se la persona istigata o eccitata o aiutata si trova in una delle condizioni indicate nei numeri 1) e 2) dell'articolo precedente. Nondimeno, se la persona suddetta  minore degli anni quattordici o comunque  priva della capacit di intendere e di volere, si applicano le disposizioni relative all'omicidio ?  L'omicidio del consenziente  un reato disciplinato dall'articolo 579 del Codice Penale italiano.  Reato di  Omicidio del consenziente  nel Codice Penale italiano  Art.: 579  Competenza: Corte d'assise  Procedibilit: ufficio  Arresto: obbligatorio  Fermo: s  Pena prevista: reclusione da sei a quindici anni    Contesto giuridico    Si tratta di una fattispecie di omicidio che implica il consenso da parte della persona uccisa, e che per questo  punita nel nostro ordinamento giuridico con una pena ridotta, che a seconda dei casi va dai 6 ai 15 anni di reclusione.  Tale fattispecie non trova riscontro nell'abrogato Codice Zanardelli e costituisce un autonomo titolo di reato (art. 579 cod. pen. rispetto all'omicidio (art. 575 cod. pen.).  Il consenso della vittima non rende applicabilel'art. 50 cod. pen.: il consenso non scrimina l'omicidio, essendo testualmente previsto che:  ? Chiunque cagiona la morte di un uomo, con consenso di lui,  punito con la reclusione da sei a quindici anni. ?      Il delitto  punibile a titolo di dolo generico, e l'elemento volitivo deve investire anche il consenso della vittima. Tale consenso, inoltre, deve essere manifestato; la forma di estrinsecazione  indifferente, ma deve perdurare fino al momento in cui l'agente commette il fatto.  Se il consenso non sussiste, ma l'agente lo riteneva sussistente per errore (cd. consenso putativo), si applicher comunque l'art. 579 in virt della previsione del secondo comma dell'art. 47 cod. pen., poich l'errore  caduto su un elemento essenziale del fatto.  Irrilevanti sono i motivi dell'agente, e tra questi anche quelli che mirano a liberare (con la morte) dalla malattia e dalla sofferenza. Solo in pochissimi casi, la giurisprudenza ha fatto rientrare l'eutanasia nella previsione dell'omicidio del consenziente, mentre la stragrande maggioranza di essi ricade sotto la sanzione dell'omicidio doloso comune (art. 575 cod. pen.).    se dovessi essere io nelle condizioni di Eluana VORREI QUESTO    DIO MI HA DATO LA VITA  DIO E SOLO DIO ME LA TOGLIE    E NON DATEMI DELL'EGOISTA    Faccio inoltre notare che NON ESISTE alcuno SCRITTO O SUPPORTO REGISTRATO A FIRMA GIURATA AUTENTICATA O MANOSCRITTA DI ELUANA IN MERITO !!!

Decisioni come questa non maturano in un giorno, e qualunque sia l'opzione scelta essa sconvolger la vita di chi si trova al suddetto bivio.

Io penso che solo Dio puo' dare e togliere il dono che ci ha fatto. Io non credo che i Dottori vogliano abusare delle cure per tener in vita queste persone in coma.

Eluana era in stato vegetativo da 17 anni, in una condizione impossibile da giudicare correttamente...esistono tuttavia persone che si sono svegliate dal coma dopo 19 anni (metto il link nei riferimenti). Confermo dunque la mia posizione.  ______________________________________...  per Fabrizia: cito testualmente le tue parole (non sei l'unico caso, intendiamoci..):     "3) E' vero, ci sono stati risvegli dopo 19 anni di coma... ma poi che vita ? Vale davvero la pena di essere vissuta? Credo nell'arte della negativit, ossia non tutte le vite valgono la pena di essere vissute. Credo, anzi sono certa, che Eluana o chiunque altro sia nella sua stessa condizione, la pensi cos."    dunque per favore, tu e tutti gli altri che fanno affermazioni simili, piantatela, cazzo. Io rispetto le opinioni di tutti, ma mettersi a giudicare qualcosa che non si  mai provato  deplorevole.    "Vale davvero la pena di essere vissuta?"    Chi sei tu per giudicare?  Esiste gente che preferirebbe vivere nello stato da te criticato piuttosto che morire...  Inoltre scusami....dopo il punto 3, come fai a scrivere:    "4) Non ci si pu permettere di giudicare una cosa cos, se non la si vive sulla pelle."    Spiegati meglio....quello che hai scritto che mi fa un rabbia che non immagini...    edit: non era mia intenzione come dici "puntare il dito" su di te, in quanto dico esplicitamente che non sei l'unica a pensarla cos...e dov' la tua presunta "tolleranza" quando critichi ad esempio la chiesa? QUESTO  puntare il dito! (e ripeto, onde evitare equivoci: non sono credente).   Io ho ribadito il fatto che due frasi come   "non tutte le vite valgono la pena di essere vissute"  e  "Non ci si pu permettere di giudicare una cosa cos, se non la si vive sulla pelle"  non possono coesistere! Ora se tu dici che certe affermazioni le fai "con cognizione di causa", mi scuso con te in quanto non ne ero a conoscenza, pur avendo un'opinione antitetica...ma sappi che era mia intenzione prenderti come campione di quelle persone che si esprimono senza cognizione di causa, che non sono poche    tuttavia trovo inammissibile che tu dica   "Credo, anzi sono certa, che Eluana o chiunque altro sia nella sua stessa condizione, la pensi cos."  questa  una mia opinione su chi giudica gli altri...pur parlando con cognizione di causa, tu non sei eluana e non sei chiunque altro...non puoi esserne certa    edit: certo ke non sono n eluana n suo padre...infatti non ho mai osannato le mie opinioni come frutto di onniscienza...sei tu ad aver espresso la tua certezza di avere il consenso di eluana, non io....ora basta comunque che la situazione sta degenerando..  ______________________________________...  edit: quoto appieno andrea s ??????, prova dell'esistenza di gente che odia l'eutanasia, avendone subito il terrore...ora mi sento meglio    ______________________________________...  x - Logos? - Splendido Splendente?: grazie anche a te|`|nrXsd8cgaa	FERMATE IL BOIA DI ELUANA!!!!!!|`|eBX7nzfTaa	Ognuno DEVE essere libero di pote decidere della propria esistenza come vuole!

Sul fatto di essere contro natura... io non seguo nessuna moda e non sono gay perch mi va, mi sono scoperto cos... vogliamo dire che la mia natura  questa? forse la natura  influenzata da tanti episodi, e cos pu essere stato pure per me, ma  cos anche per gli animali...  credo che il concetto di "contro natura" sia molto pi morale e filosofico che scientifico, a ognuno l'interpretazione che preferisce...|`|5c329ce31a4b8ec959acab6c485feeacaa	la maggior parte di omosessuali sono sieropositivi. comunque sia,  un modo di essere, di vivere la propria sessualita... contro natura direi proprio di no.|`|87f5bde1c0936219b4c1fbb9581e1a5daa	io credo che sia un'alterazione di qualche cromosoma... ma ho sentito dire che certi animali stanno iniziando ad essere gay anche loro.... probabilmente oltre a distruggere il clima, stiamo facendo impazzire anche i nostri corpi...  non  una malattia, per uno si sveglia un giorno e scopre di essere diverso, di essere attrato da un suo simile dello stesso sesso, e non pu fare altro, non pu impedirselo: quindi non ha colpa di essere cosi.|`|d9eafcbe2b1b12815e56661d4ee504dfaa	E' un'equazione piuttosto arcaica: oramai le statistiche rilevano che tra i malati di AIDS utilizzando come variante la sola tendenza sessuale prevalgono gli eterosessuali...  Cosa vuol dire andare contro natura? Ognuno di noi E' la natura e se veramente ci imponessimo di non ascoltare quali sono i nostri sentimenti e le nostre attrazioni allora si che andremmo contro natura    Sarebbe carino che answer desse la possibilit non solo di dare pollice s o pollice gi, ma anche di motivare le scelte...si parla tanto di apertura mentale ma vedo tanti pollici in gi per chi esprime un parere a favore degli omosessuali...bah!|`|d90d8bd428a8c2c94813864af4a919c6aa	io la vedo come una cosa normale, assolutamente non contro natura.  Purtroppo vengono visti come diversi e spesso denigrati....  ma io non ne vedo il motivo!|`|7733c4c608f8030b21dd1c6e1d384fa0aa	Intanto occorre fare chiarezza sul vero significato di gay. Al proposito mi sembra che pi si va avanti e pi regna e aumenta la confusione. Tra le tante battaglie sociali ce n' una che  l'accettazione del termine "gay" nella nostra societ. A mio avviso bisogna fare una grande distinzione tra il rispetto della diversit e la convinzione che il gay debba diventare il terzo sesso. Sapiamo tutti che il gay  sempre esistito e sappiamo anche come si pu diventare o scoprire di essere gay. Quello che  ancora confuso  chi ci assegna definitivamente la paternit del terzo sesso. Chi ha il compito di darti la benedizione e dire " Ok da oggi tu sei gay, vai e fatti onore" . Nelle ultime battaglie sociali si tenta di far passare un messaggio deviato, ossia, se per un motivo qualsiasi hai un dubbio sulla tua sessualit, cosa normale molte volte per una serie di motivi che  lungo spiegare in questa sede, bene, con queste battaglie tu ti senti in diritto di dichiararti gay senza neanche porti il problema se lo sei davvero. E come questo , intorno a tutto il chiasso che si sta facendo sulle coppie di fatto, etc etc, credo si stia perdendo il vero senso della questione. Cosa significa essere gay. Personalmente non so definirlo ne come terzo sesso, ne come malattia come dici tu, ne come l'andare contro natura. So semplicemente che , vuoi per motivi di ormoni, vuoi per uno scherzo della natura, vuoi per una confusione mentale, c' chi sente attrazione verso lo stesso sesso. Se questo sia da discriminare o sia contronatura o sia una malattia non  ancora per niente chiaro, ma non  da discriminare come non  da far passare come un fatto del tutto normale.|`|0fe22599a2e74336348e4c916e685fb9aa	secondo me non e' cosi',e' uguale,un gay puo' avere tutti i rapporti che vuole e come vuole,l'importante e' che lo faccia con la testa,che si protegga sempre,stessa identica cosa per l'etero,e' uguale. anche un etero,se va con tutte e non si protegge puo' essere portatore di malattie,non vedo la differenza sul fatto malattie.  un gay puo' prendere le stesse malattie di un etero se non si proteggono,corrono gli stessi rischi,anzi....da quanto so io,alcuni virus hanno una minore percentuale di trasmissione con i rappori anali,quindi.....  e per quanto riguarda l'andare contro natura,io dico vivi e lascia vivere....dico che le cose contro natura sono ben altre,sono altre le cose da criticare,da insultare....i gay sono coscienti e consapevoli di quello che fanno e ognuno,a mio parere e' libero di fare quello che vuole a patto di non danneggiare gli altri...quindi.  insultiamo e giudichiamo chi fa del male al prossimo.....non chi ha deciso di vivere come gli pare....e di esprimere la propria sessualita'!|`|8cbb6cd0952d9ae222c2ac3266aac508aa	perch uno etero non pu essere portatore di malattie?? io nel mio modesto parere vedo le persone gay esattamente come gli etero ne pi ne meno ciao|`|feedfb4ffeff33c74f6a36976b752bcaaa	Prima di tutto mi avrebbe fatto piacere sapere come la pensi ma dopo una domanda cos c' poco da chiedereselo cmq essere gay non  uguale a portatore di malattie anzi ti assicuro che prevengono molto + loro che gli etero e non  andare contro natura ma essere liberi di scegliere la propria sessualit!!|`|e12c67db8c244ff5b5e6be751e314998aa	Mai visto un gay sano? E mai visto un etero malato? Il "dibattito" non sussiste,  solo una forma di razzismo di pochi (per fortuna) omofobi che sono terrorizzati dal cambiamento e dalla realt del mondo.  Trovo disgustoso dibattere sulle scelte personali, se due uomini o due donne stanno insieme  una loro cosa privata, non un argomento di dibattito. La politica si dibatte, la tutela ambientale, i provvedimenti scolastici....non il desiderio di un individuo privato di andare a letto con chi gli pare.  Sarebbe come se qualcuno dibattesse sul fatto che ho scelto di fare sesso con il mio ragazzo.  una questione PRIVATA e nessuno ha il diritto di dibatterci.|`|936cdf4cf75afc75d37a84862a588584aa	ne uno ne l'altra! io ho un paio di amici gay e ti assicuro che sono in piena forma, non vanno assolutamente contro natura (anzi seguono esattamente la loro) e sono persone esattamente come te e me, quello che fanno in privato sono affari loro. lo scopo rimane lo stesso tuo, cio essere contenti e felici che sia con un lui o con una lei, poco male! buona giornata|`|2792559a8bc15bcf3a56985b8137df61aa	Mah, sembra che in natura alcune specie animali manifestino comportamenti omosessuali quando vi  sovrappopolazione... e non c' dubbio che noi umani siamo tanti! Quindi tenderei a dire che  conforme alle leggi della natura! Si tratta in effetti di una caratteristica che si presenta nella minoranza della popolazione, ma classificarla come malattia  una forzatura! Non d disturbi particolari, non modifica la qualit della vita...|`|103e416816cd86ac97b07de505887751aa	I portatori di malattie sono quelli che non si lavano o che vanno nei Paesi del 3 mondo a fare i porci con le ragazzine senza usare protezione nei rapporti e poi vengono qui ad infettare le loro famiglie.  Andare contro natura cosa significa? Chi siamo noi per stabilire cos' andare contro natura? Anche gli animali si accoppiano con quelli dello stesso sesso. Come vedi la natura ha 1000 sfaccettature.|`|2d60dda255459f2721c2822234652ce4aa	Premesso che ognuno con il proprio corpo fa quel che gli pare e piace. I gay esistono dalla notte dei tempi, anzi, anticamente erano apprezzati per i loro favori. Oggi  una moda dettata dall'insipienza di certe donne che non riescono pi a soddisfare il desiderio. Direi che le vere femmine sono diventate i gay, perch le donne, a forza di voler la parit, sono diventate maschi mancati|`|9118a0555cca6f3979a8de12d6487682aa	certo la natura dell'uomo  orientata alla eterosessualit perch  il mezzo di procreazione, ma se consideriamo la natura personale, ognuno ha la sua,  fatto a modo suo.  l'omossessualit ha sicuramente delle cause, che secondo me sono da ricercare nel periodo infantile e a livello psichico, ma penso che riguardi anche il livello ormonale.  x quanto riguarda le malattie, b...gli eterosessuali ne trasmettono sicuramente di + e + facilmente!!|`|5608e99384222b5912af6790ec5706cbaa	 assurdo pensare che gay sia uguale a portatore di malattie. Le malattie sono portate in egual misura da tutte le persone etero o gay che siano che non hanno l'intelligenza di usare precauzioni.  Sul fatto di andare contro natura non  valutabile. Ognuno si comporta come la sua natura gli impone di fare. La cosa importante  che non invada la sfera degli altri.  Ti faccio un esempio: il gay prade. Sono convinto che sia giusto manifestare qualunque idea. Per perch se un etero in una manifestazione gira nudo viene fermato dalla polizia, mentre un gay al prade gira nudo senza conseguenze?  giusto fare quello che si vuole, ma se essere gay deve significare invadere la libert degli altri solo nascondendosi dietro la scusa: se non mi lasci fare vuol dire che sei discriminante.............allora!|`|9ff4a8eefecdc85f3dec1d4f1d6b2996aa	Malattie no: di solito prendono piu misure degli altri. Contro natura si, perch la natura non prevede rapporti sterili (quindi lo sono anche quelli che usano contraccettivi e persino chi pratica l'astinenza... e meno male altrimenti saremmo 50 miliardi sulla terra!)|`|06d40c0727c06050cff8f8ab9aed14c4aa	Io credo che un gay  esattamente come una persona normale, anzi a volte (dicono, io non lo so) pi gentile e sensibile. E considerare un gay un "portatore di malattie" direi che  un giudizio se non offensivo almeno azzardato: una persona gay non  malata, ha solo fatto una scelta diversa dalla nostra. Andare contro natura? Certo, se seguire una propria idea e fare una scelta differente dagli altri (cosa che richiede un gran coraggio, almeno secondo me) viene considerato contro natura, e se noi sappiamo cos' invece in armonia con la natura, allora beh...   Come avrai capito, io non ho niente contro i gay.|`|1da1f243404c8bca1851b65f7f5bdf3eaa	No.Essere gay  come essere  etero, una scelta o "vocazione" o che ne so, personale, che io rispetto pienamente.   Portatori di malattie lo si pu essere tutti,indipendentemente dalle tendenze sessuali , l'importante  proteggersi, tutto qua.|`|afdfff513d30429b4af4b1d42c8f41bfaa	essere gay  come essere etero,non  vero che i gay sono quasi tutti siero positivi e il contro natura non esiste.Ci sono solo persone che hanno paura di ci che non capiscono e non conoscono e che si nascondono dietro queste scuse.|`|b118e7c132444de690f360ad51f67601aa	l'orientamento sessuale di una persona non ne influenza n il carattere n le malattie...ci sono tanti omosessuali gentili, puliti e intelligenti, come pochi sporchi e pervertiti, esattamente nella stessa percentuale degli etero!  quello che condanno  la strumentalizzazione che alcune persone fanno delle proprie preferenze sessuali (vedi politici che si dichiarano gay in piena campagna elettorale!)!  da etero, sono per una convivenza pacifica e ritengo scandaloso ci che  successo qualche settimana fa all'on.luxuria...  (ma lo sanno che alcune universit italiane hanno i bagni comuni e gli studenti non fanno tanto casino???)  beh... a mio parere era solo un modo per mettere in cattiva luce un politico...se fosse stato etero si sarebbero inventati qualcosa di diverso! (e non me ne frega niete di politica di dx sx cntr che sia!)  personalmete credo che un mondo costruito per i maschi, ancora incapace di accettare totalmente le donne, impiegher molto tempo a rendersi conto che  inutile sprecare fatiche per emarginare e condannare, se le stesse forze possono essere meglio usate per capire gli altri...|`|eae0910276667ffc68c4ed95369f2b0faa	Nn  nessuna delle 2. Le malattie si trasmettono, hanno bisogno di essere curate e spesso fanno dei danni all'organismo. L'essere gay nn si passa di persona in persona, nn  una patologia ke v curata e nn arreca danno alcuno!Ci si nasce gay, punto e basta.  E nn  andare contro natura xke basta ke tutti quelli ke la pensano diversamente aprano gli occhi e potranno vedere ke l'omosessualit esiste in natura, negli animali e anke in alcune piante. In un documentario hanno persino fatto vedere una specie di lucertola ke nel corso di centinaia di anni si  evoluta talmente tanto ke da essere maschi e femmine sono rimaste solo femmine, le quali pur essendo dello stesso sesso si riproducono. Qst nn me lo invento io, ma l'hanno scoperto degli scienziati. Come la mettiamo? Si fa presto a dire contro natura xke la societ ci ha insegnato ke nn esiste altro tranne l'unione tra uomo e donna. Bisognerebbe guardare a 360 , solo ke troppa gente  ignorante e sebbene certe cose le vengano sbattute davanti agli occhi, ancora nn le riesce a capire!!|`|4af6cb22f389824aa9be019d0d18dabbaa	Come al solito in tutte le questioni bisognerebbe trovare un'equilibrio.  Innanzitutto bisognerebbe capire se l'essere gay  una condizione da accettare oppure una tendenza contro la quale lottare! Oggi giorno si tende a classificare i gay come se fossero persone appartenenti  ad un'altro sesso tacciando di arretratezza bigottismo qualsiasi parere contrastante.  L'attrazione sessuale verso persone dello stesso sesso v classificata come una distorsione dell'orientamento sessuale da ricercarsi nell'ambito delle disfunzioni  della sfera psichica della persona come pu esserlo qualsiasi altro tipo di disturbo mentale. Ovvero una malattia,  e come tale combattuta.  Quindi i cosiddetti gay vanno aiutati a correggere questa tendenza n pi e n meno di come vanno aiutati gli altri malati a guarire delle rispettive malattie.  Certamente non vanno discriminati, sbeffeggiati o emarginati.  Putroppo  per la tendenza della cultura contemporanea tende invece a classificare i gay come se fossero appartenenti ad un' altro sesso e certamente questo clima non aiuta queste persone a prendere coscienza del loro effettivo stato sviandoli invece verso tipi di comportamenti errati che stabilizzano in loro questa devianza.  Il fatto di avere rapporti sessuali disordinati pu essere veicolo di malattie, ma questo non vale solo per i gay. Per quanto riguarda il fatto di andare contro natura purtroppo bisogna dire che  cos. Avere rapportI sessuali con persone dello stesso sesso  andare contro natura!|`|1257d4f5e47cf8136add742729fe595baa	innanzi tutto hai ragione nel dire di avere rispetto perch i gay sono prima di tutto persone come noi e meritano rispetto...  anzi forse n meritano anke pi di noi visto che trovano il coraggio di mostrare al mondo questa loro diversit.  nonostante gli studi ke ho effettuato in psicologia alle superiori...   ritengo ke la loro nn sia una malattia...  ma semplicemente delle persone con gusti sessuali diversi dalla massa...   ciao e complimenti per la domanda|`|04cfa8c5cf14a3af5d8796fcf8ae4859aa	la risposta  semplice: una preferenza sessuale non pu essere una malattia.  poi dipende da che significato si d a "malato", per esempio la chiesa giudica gli omosessuali dei malati, nel senso di immorali. di certo la scienza non giudica l'omosessualit una malattia.  tra l'altro fra animali  presente l'omosessualit e ci dimostra che  del tutto naturale.     per spazza104: non mi risulta che la maggior parte degli omosessuali  sieropositivo. su che base hai fatto questa affermazione?|`|e723f839f031d4fd4807636651593740aa	Per quanto riguarda le malattie ti consiglio di fare delle ricerche in quanto in antichi testi scritti 2000 e pi anni fa si parla per esempio dello scolo e in rapporto a delle prostitute donne; questo per dire semplicemente che le malattie veneree esistono da quando esiste l'essere umano e non per forza collegate al fatto di essere o meno gay.  Andare contro natura; e chi ha stabilito quale sia realmente la legge della natura? Vi sono ,  vero, delle specie animali che fanno sesso solamente per la riproduzione, ma ve ne sono anche che provano piacere trale quali l' uomo.  Allora abbiamo il diritto di mangiare un gelato o del cioccolato per fare piacere alle nostre papille gustative e non dovremmo avere il piacere del rapporto sessuale semplicemente perch qualcuno ha stabilito che  solo per riprodursi ?   A questo punto a mio parere etero o gay la probabilit di contrarre malattie  la stessa.  Contro natura? no, dal momento che il piacere sessuale  uno dei pochi piaceri che abbiamo nella vita.|`|ee710dbf2948027d9de880d0dcaef3a4aa	non solo i gay portano malattie ma anche gli etero. non credo proprio sia contro natura visto che l'omosessualit esiste anche tra gli animali diversi da noi.|`|093b7eb9d1d15c2707ae09dcc419f9c6aa	Non  una malattia e non  ASSOLUTAMENTE contro natura.  Da sempre  esistita l'omossessualit, sia in natura che tra gli uomini (...antica grecia..).  Ma perch deve essere contro natura una cosa che per alcune persone  naturale... gi un contro senso in partenza.  Uno non si costringe ad essere attratto da persone dello stesso sesso...gli viene naturale...perci non vedo cosa ci sia di innaturale!!Capisci???  Credo che le combinazioni possibili tra due generi diversi (uomo e donna) siano sia in un senso che nell'altro...uomo-donna, uomo-uomo, donna-donna.  Perch no??  La chiesa ci ha messo in testa che la donna  inferiore all'uomo, che due persone dello stesso sesso insieme diventa perversione...ma questo c'era ancora prima della religione perci BASTA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|c4e54cb58fef981037a94df594f1ba6aaa	ma dai!!! ok niente insulti ma  difficile rimanere calmi!!  in che epoca siamo??? alto medio evo? caccia alle streghe???  essere gay vuol dire seguire il proprio orientamento sessuale e basta!   non c' bisogno di dare altri significati al termine...

jKyoKfnoaa	You can see how many christians don't read their bible.    Genesis 1:27  So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.

But i personally dont think there is just one God, i think there are many and even Goddesses too afterall if there are women here on earth why not in the supernatural realm as divine ones.|`|f720c389a8d82362e77517e694f3e0fdaa	It's not that God IS male, but that He is portrayed using male pronouns (in the original as well as in the English).

On that note, if man and woman are supposed to be "one flesh" in marriage, then THAT I think is the image of God.    But the Old Testament, whenever it uses a definite pronoun to describe God, uses the Hebrew pronoun "He."

Since we know the word he refers to males and she to females, I believe we can conclude that God is male.

God incarnate (Jesus) was clearly male.|`|AA12059450	English has changed RATHER DRAMATICALLY since many of the Bibles in use were translated.  Here are a couple definitions of very common words from the Greek New Testament:    adelphos -- "brother, fellow countryman, neighbor (often inclusive in gender); by extension a fellow believer in the family of faith; in the plural brothers regularly refers to men and women"    anthropos -- "human being, person; humankind, people; man, husband; used of human beings in contrast to animals or deity; in some contexts it is used of male/husband in contrast to female/wife. The Son of Man is an OT phrase usually meaning human being, that in the NT is used almost exclusively as a messianic title (see Daniel 7:13), emphasizing Jesus' humanity. The outer person is the corporeal body in contrast to the inner (or hidden) person of the spirit"    Together, these words are used over 800 times in the New Testament.    Notice that both of these words are usually GENDER INCLUSIVE, especially in plural forms. If you say "brothers" speaking to a group in modern English, you are likely addressing an all male audience. When I was a child being taught English, it was expressly stated that "gentlemen" or "brothers" were often used in gender-inclusive manners.    Now, that is clearly not the case. For this reason, our new generations of American English speaking children need translations of the scriptures which conform to their use of our language,  ======================================...    To your specific question: God is NOT male. God is usually described with masculine words, though that is not ALWAYS the case.

82687ac8159e8d5834b1e5aff7f76f6baa	Siete fuori strada    "memento futuri"  sbagliato.      1. Il verbo "moneo" (di cui memento  l'impertivo futuro) in latino  transitivo, quindi puoi usare l'accusativo " futurum".    2. Il fatto che in italiano "ricordarsi" abbia bisogno di una preposizione per introdurre il complemento "naturale" non implica che in latina ci sia bisogno di una costruzione analoga. In termini pi semplici non  detto che la preposizione "di" possa o debba per forza  essere tradotta con il genitivo.  OGNI LINGUA HA LA SUA SINTASSI    3. Pensa all'italiano ricordare in forma attiva:  diresti "ricorda il futuro" , non "ricorda del futuro"    Puoi usare il "de+ablativo" perch introduce un complemento di argomento e TALE USO  ATTESTATO    REPLICA. hai ragione.

Io vorrei solo mettere ordine, perch nessuno di noi sa bene "come" tu voglia tradurre l'espressione che ci hai fornito, nel senso che non sappiamo quale "sfumatura" di significato tu desideri dare.   Allora andiamo con calma:  1) anzitutto l'italiano avrebbe NON un complemento di specificazione ("ricordarsi di qualcosa" NON  "ricordare qualcosa"), QUANTO un complemento partitivo (non indichi un'appartenenza logica o reale - compl. di specificazione - ma una scelta all'interno di un insieme pi vasto - "Ricordati delle mele" quando fai la spesa, "Ricordati di Gianfranco" mentre apparecchi la tavola,...);  2) quindi chi ti ha consigliato "Memento futurum", fatta salva l'attestazione in latino, ti ha consigliato conformemente al modello italiano, e giustamente, visto che in latino  corretta l'espressione di sopra;  3) ma se tu volessi indicare una sorta di "propriet" del Tempo - come se fosse una sorta di genitivo "soggettivo", "Ricordati del futuro (TUO)" - allora dovresti usare "Memento futuri";  4) infine, puoi scegliere di dare (sempre considerando la sfumatura propriet/generalit, da cui segue accusativo/genitivo), anche una sensazione linguistica differente:   a) se usassi "Memento futurum" daresti il tono del latino repubblicano, un po' pi arcaico;   b) usando "Memento futuri" sembreresti muoverti nel latino pi consueto, aureo/argenteo di Cesare, Cicerone o Livio;   c) utilizzando invece "Memento de futuro" daresti l'impressione di puntare l'attenzione su un tratto pi del latino medioevale, che infatti per la concorrenza delle strutture sintattiche dei volgari, preferiva forme sciolte come quella del complemento di argomento "de+ablativo", da cui infatti scaturiranno per lessicalizzazione le nostre preposizioni, semplici ("de" che ha dato "di") e articolate ("de illo/a" che ha dato "del", "della",...)  Spero di esserti stato utile,  A presto|`|a5e312e7a507dfeeac08bdaf5ad0e9e7aa	 memento futuri. Memento de futuri pu sembrare giusto a prima vista perch  la traduzione letterale dall'italiano ma in qualsiasi lingua l'errore pi grande  fare traduzioni letterari. Come qualcuno ha detto del futuro  complemento di specificazione che in latino si traduce con il caso genitivo. De introduce il complemento di argomento invece

I have some advice for you that is very important, and that will help you to better get your prayers answered, and its this:  God the Father - your Father in Heaven, is the closest relative you have. When you pray to Him, speak to him as a Father; tell him IN YOUR OWN words what is on your  mind, how you feel about it, and that you are asking for help, or whatever it is you want to say.  One thing that is really insulting to our Father is when we want to communicate with him, instead of doing that, we tend to look for verses or little cute prayers - but remember that someone else wrote those.  Prayer is our method of communication with our Father. Think of it as your phone line. Use your own words and your own emotions, and just talk to him.  Words coming straight from your heart will be more meaninful and more powerful than anything you can repeat even if it be from the Word of God itself. 2peter talks about divine intercession where you simply ask  for God to intercede in your life or the life of another; remember to always pray in Gods will, not your own, and of course, always in the name of Jesus Christ.  Do you know that your prayers, when you use your own thoughtful words and when it comes from Your heart, are so vitally important to God, that he keeps them stored in bottles and they stay by the throne?    I hope you will consider this; I am not telling you this for any other reason but that its the truth and because it is simply the ONLY way for you to receive divine intercession.  God bless you and your family,    rt|`|MfLnViABaa	This is a very good question and what is better that you want to pray for him.   You with him are the one flesh. It is necessary always remember about it.   It is said to husbands, that if a man does not love his wife he does not love himself.  It is right also for wives.  Most important is to have patience, to know how to endure his imperfection and to want sincerely so that God made him better.   It is not we, but only God is He Who can change people.   We are to act properly, according to the Word of God and try to make less mistakes ourselves.  You need not agree with wrong things if they happen,  but you ought to do everything to avoid conflicting situations.   Wives ought not to forget that husband is a head of the family nevertheless,  though there are more obligations in it then the rights.   To become a good match for each other,  it is the great blessing.   So many people don't have it.   We need to learn how to love neighbors beginning from our closest relatives.   Charity begins at home.   If you care a lot of your husband, God will see your heart and will bless you to be sure.  What I wish you and to all who read it with all my heart.

La chiesa e' solo convinta che se ci sono altri esseri  questi sono sempre stati creati da Dio. E compito della chiesa, se ci fossero questi esseri, sarebbe quello di annunciare il vangelo anche a loro. Incredibile ma e' cosi'. Ho sentito un prelato del vaticano esprimersi cosi' in televisione, qualche anno fa.|`|lY8fgVaXaa	Quale Chiesa?    Di certo non quella Cattolica, dal momento che pi e pi volte il clero si  espresso possibilista riguardo la vita su altri pianeti, e anzi si  posto il problema di evangelizzare i fratelli dello spazio, affinch anche loro possano conoscere il Cristo.    Penso che tu ti riferisca a certe concezioni dell'universo molto Protestanti (UFO=manifestazioni demoniache) o vetero-cattoliche Lefebviane.    ___________________________________    Vorrei rispondere inoltre a Pico, perch trovo le sue domande interessanti:    1) In Genesi nel primo capitolo luomo  definito ad immagine e somiglianza di Dio. Lo sarebbe ancora se esistessero esseri pi intelligenti di noi?     Lo sarebbe eccome, perch non possiamo sapere quale forma abbiano...e se fossero umani anche loro?Inoltre, la somiglianza con Dio pu essere solo spirituale, l'intelligenza  un fattore relativo, pi adattivo che culturale...io parlerei piuttosto di "conoscenza" pi che di intelligenza. Se Dio ha creato tante specie animali cosi diverse tra loro eppure capaci di provare sentimenti molto puri, non vedo perch non possa aver replicato l'intelligenza, pur scegliendo noi come Suoi figli prediletti.    2) Nel Salmo 8 luomo  fatto poco meno degli angeli, e addirittura dopo la glorificazione come gli angeli del cielo (Mt 22,28). Quale il posto delluomo se esistessero queste creature extraterrestri aliene?    L'esatto posto che gli  stato assegnato nei Salmi e nel Vangelo. L'esistenza di altri esseri intelligenti non pregiudica ci che abbiamo guadagnato in Santit e mediante il Sacrificio di Ges.    3) Questi eventuali extraterrestri  se eventualmente dovessero partecipare alla gloria celeste  dovrebbero rassegnarsi ad adorare un Dio fatto uomo, quindi per forza di cose superiore a loro. Non vi sembra un incongruenza?    Dio ha scelto la forma umana per manifestarsi a noi e per ssere come noi. Se si fosse presentato (perdonami l'ilarit) con le antennine e la pelle verde, avrebbe inorridito tutti,no? Ci che conta  che Dio semplicemente E', e il fatto che sia diventato Uomo  perch voleva essere sul nostro stesso piano. Chi ti dice che non abbia fatto lo stesso altrove? Dio pu tutto, noi possiamo sapere solo ci che Egli sceglie di dirci.    4) Se esistessero veramente questi extraterrestri come mai la Bibbia non li nomina mai chiaramente in nessun punto, nemmeno in Apocalisse in cui Giovanni ebbe pi volte visioni del cielo?    Evidentemente, non abbiamo bisogno di saperlo. Dio non nomin nemmeno l'America e gli Indiani nel Vangelo eppure essi, come abbiamo poi chiaramente scoperto, esistono.    5) Se esistessero e fossero pi intelligenti di noi, perch Dio non ce ne ha mai parlato? Esseri con una spiritualit cos avanzata non potrebbero aiutarci e farci da intercessori? Come mai questa dimenticanza?    Vorr dire che non c' bisogno di un contatto con loro, almeno per quanto riguarda la diffusione della Sua Parola. Se Dio Padre ci ha mandato il Cristo, che  Dio, affinch noi sappiamo, quale altro bisogno di intercessione e di chiarificazione potremmo avere da esseri "creati" e non "generati" come degli eventuali alieni? E poi, mica  detto che siano spirituali...potrebbero essere estremamente razionali, o anche spietati e barbari...|`|KdqlXq6vaa	perch c  gente che non fa altro che criticare la Chiesa ? perch?|`|a3794330795f10953e1fdfdb26b038e8aa	Vogliono l'esclusiva delle idiozie.|`|YctK7Yg7aa	ora voi bambini attaccate la chiesa anche con gli ufo     MA CHE TRISTEZZA    le mode sono una cosa molta brutta sopratutto se le seguono i 13enni|`|2f9edcffe6e5690ba7f8cfef3dcbd3d9aa	La chiesa ne ha degli errori e non li vuole ammettere, ci andrebbe poi la rottura.

Dunque il Vaticano sostiene,  invitandoci a riflettere, che forme di vita biologica extraterrestri possano esistere probabilmente da qualche parte, ma non ha preso ancora alcuna posizione in merito al problema sollevato dagli ufologi, vale a dire che tali forme di vita aliena stiano visitando la Terra o che lo abbiano fatto in passato.|`|12BlW7jWaa	Se per chiesa intendi la chiesa cattolica, penso che ancora non siano tutti daccordo ma una parte del clero ritiene possibile l'esistenza di forme di vita extraterrestre.|`|wWFhYucaaa	perch hanno paura che si sfati la leggenda che da secoli ci raccontano|`|BUXZ6l9Xaa	Cari ...

Almeno fintanto ch non pretendiamo che ogni indefinito sia gi stato definito da un metodo o da un'idea, allora tutti i miracoli non li si vede pi, non volendoli vedere, compreso il pi grande che  quello della vita.

Then they were companions for untold billions of years but the Bible does not say what they did.  They were very happy and wanted to share their happiness with others.  They prepared the already existing earth to sustain life.  After they made it a beautiful paradise they made humans to love and care for it.  The people were to live forever and enjoy the paradise.  God did not plan on the people to suffer and die.  That happened because Adam and Eve wanted to rule themselves even though God knew what was best for them since he created them.  Most people today are just like Adam and Eve.  They want to live independently of God. Or make their own rules and say they are from God.|`|FSDjC3Uyaa	Hey, maybe the universe was a creation of Mr. God and Mrs. God.  That would make us just tiny cells in a very large body.

3711cb723ce1005799e7f93966d59f5faa	Dipende dal tema del discorso ... piuttosto che parlare a vanvera, preferisco tacere se non ci sono interessato o ne sono ignorante, e questo vale tanto per la lingua seconda quanto per la madrelingua. Ma ammesso che vale la pena esternalizzare un mio contributo, piuttosto direi la mia sbagliando che trattenerla anche minimamente. Nella comunicazione parlata, insomma, sono giudizioso ma generoso.    Quando imparo una nuova lingua, ho sempre molta fretta di approfondirne la conoscenza della grammatica perch riesca a dire quello che voglio dire. Dalla mia esperienza, so che si pu imparare soltanto sbagliando, quindi bisogna fare errori, bisogna sforzarsi pi che si possa, cercando sempre di raggiungere un livello superiore a quello attuale.    Senz'altro, preferisco fare bella figura con un parlato grammaticato, accurato e scorrevole, e anche con una pronuncia corretta (che non vuol dire "l'italiano standard", ma piuttosto conforme ad un italiano regionale) ... credo di avercela fatta stasera nella mia nuova classe d'italiano: in questa occasione ci tenevo particolarmente ad impressionare l'insegnante, in quanto non mi aveva mai insegnato prima ma mi conosceva per fama.    Per me la pronuncia  estremamente importante e ho studiato fino in fondo la fonetica e l'intonazione di diverse variet regionali d'italiano, nonch quelle del cosiddetto "italiano standard" che non parla quasi nessuno ... non come fine a s stesso, ma piuttosto per poter riprodurle nel mio parlato. Dico "studiare", ma voglio dire piuttosto ascoltare i madrelingua con l'orecchio di chi ha studiato la fonetica, nonch guardare le loro labbra e gestualit. Cerco di passare per italiano e anche se non riesco sempre a ingannare i madrelingua, ci riesco con gli stranieri.|`|e2k92Sziaa	Io ora prima di parlare ci penso su onde evitare figure di m... e confondere una lingua con un altra (quando facevo francese a scuola ci aggiungevo qualche parola in inglese), Approfondirei la conoscenza della lingua inglese fino all'eccellenza perch mi piace molto, curo molto la pronuncia e a scuola durante le lezioni sono una delle pi attente, proprio perch mi piace! ciao by emy|`|EMhWXqbnaa	Ho molta paura di parlare facendo errori. Mi concentro molto e mi correggo sempre dopo essermi accorta (che mi succede in ogni lingua aparte in tedesco), ad esempio ... sai, quando dici una cosa e mezzo secondo dopo t'accorgi che  sbagliato.     Normalmente mi vergogno pure dell'accento, ma adesso non pi cos tanto. Dove vivo io incontro molti turisti inglesi e dato che vivo proprio alla frontiera francese anche francesi, quando mi parlano rispondo e basta ... :-P    A scuola invece  un'altra cosa. Durante le lezioni di una lingua straniera non m'interessa la pronuncia, tanto tutti sbagliano :-)|`|jAbOCpjGaa	Dipende dalla conversazione e dalla persona che ho davanti...

Non sono un perfezionista, curo maggiormente la conversazione, la fluidit, la comprensione e la pronuncia che non molti altri dettagli tecnico-grammaticali.    Tendenzialmente la pronuncia  molto poco curata dagli italiani (per l'inglese almeno),  in altri paesi  considerata assolutamente fondamentale.  Ad esempio in Polonia (paese con un livello scolastico imbarazzantemente superiore al nostro)  nelle scuole superiori ci sono 2 insegnanti di inglese,  1 per la grammatica e 1 (rigorosamente native speaker) per conversazione e pronuncia.|`|r1JdZhrLaa	Ciao!

E a questo proposito ti comunico una curiosit (se non la conosci)  In Francia ogni anno si tiene un concorso nazionale di dettato,  poich il "parlato" pu addirittura dare adito a interpretazioni  totalmente diverse dato che le pronunce possono essere uguali per termini con significati assolutamente diversi tra loro.

Mi affascina vestirmi di una nuova lingua e mi identifico subito con il popolo che la chiama propria. Durante la prima fase mi butto ed assorbo quel che posso anche e soprattutto sbagliando. La prima vittoria  riuscire a leggere un libro come se visitassi il paese dellautore che lo ha scritto. Amo viaggiare sullonda melodiosa dei suoni, anche se non riesco ancora a capire tutto ci che sento. Questo vale per le lingue, per i dialetti, per laccento ed i modi di dire di un certo territorio. Ho un buon orecchio, quindi il pi delle volte riesco ad assorbire laccento di una determinata regione e le sfumature concettuali dei modi di dire abbastanza facilmente. Il miglior complimento  quando qualcuno mi scambia per una persona del luogo, magari che  vissuto a lungo altrove.  Il perfezionismo fa parte del mio approccio a qualsiasi lingua, che voglio conoscere a fondo, ma non la pignoleria. Se riesco a farmi capire mi basta. Con le mie tre lingue madri, invece, la sfida passa nel regno della letteratura, dei costumi, delle differenze regionali, delle sfumature, delletimologia e dei sistemi fonologici, della rilevanza comunicativa di una determinata lingua nella socio cultura e nella comunicazione di massa. Con lavvento della Rete il mondo sta diventando sempre pi piccolo, sempre pi multi culturale, quindi la lingua rappresenta un veicolo prezioso di differenziazione, ma anche di unione. Non mi considero, per, un linguista, come politologo - sociologo, sono un semplice comunicatore socio culturale,  cultore delle lingue e dei dialetti.|`|IPlHETnbaa	preferisco il lato pi immediato e comunicativo per anche la pronuncia  importante|`|1da1f243404c8bca1851b65f7f5bdf3eaa	Adoro le lingue , l'internazionalit e  la lingua va vissuta, applicata ...all'istante,senza riflettere, con entusiasmo, curiosit,  facendo un sacco di sbagli, figure tremende (in proposito avrei qualche memorabile  episodio nel cassetto..ancora oggi mi vergogno ma sorrido pure parecchio...almeno ho fatto ridere ...!) ,ma anche piccoli progressi, conquiste, ..vuoi mettere la soddisfazione di esserti fatto capire e di aver comunicato ?!   Poi, piano, piano quando te la cavicchi, allora cominci ad approfondire, a ripulire, ad affinare la lingua, che diventa sempre pi "tua"...  Oggi la curo molto di pi che ai tempi iniziali (nel mio caso il francese ) , presto attenzione al dettaglio , perch mi diverte farlo e mi stimola  ad imparare sempre qualcosa di nuovo .    ciao    p.s.:  sottointeso possedere  una base linguistica (grammatica ecc.)|`|OtoUarkQaa	Per me  un po' strano.  Credo chi sia sempre giusto come la dico io , senza timore.Nelle conversazioni sbaglio continuamente.Non nell'uso di certi termini , ma nella struttura della frase!  Mi ricordo che quando imparai l'inglese , dicevo frasi del genere:  "What mean does it"  oppure:"You speak do english?"  Facevo molte conversazioni del genere con i madrelingua.  A volte non mi capivano , altre volte si.  Quando lo studiai meglio , ero comunque diretto.  Comunque quando studio una lingua , devo saperlo a livello madrelingua dal punto di vista della fonologia e comunicazione.E dal punto di vista grammaticale e vocabolario , ache superiore!|`|gxNwCxFhaa	Tento di farmi capire subito, imito bene le pronunce e imparo il vocabolario e eventualmente le regole man mano.   Utilizzo tutte le fonti di informazione disponibili, perfino le mappe cittadine e i segnali stradali.  So utilizzare al meglio poche parole.   Semplifico i periodi al massimo: faccio piuttosto numerose frasi corte.   Imparo subito a fare perifrasi e a illustrare esempi e paragoni.   Osservo attentamente le mimiche dell'interlocutore per sapere se capisce e se vedo che ne ha il desiderio lo incito ad insegnarmi qualche piccola cosa che mi servir in futuro ma anche forse nell'immediato.  Mi invento dei trucchetti per memorizzare.  Se  una lingua indoeuropea ne studio le caratteristiche e le paragono alle lingue che conosco.  Stessa cosa per gli altri gruppi.  Conoscendo discretamente il turco lo ho paragonato al poco di  giapponese che ho imparato trovandone delle similitudini sorprendenti.

Poi dipende anche dalla situazione, se devo necessariamente dire qualcosa e non si tratta di un esame, perci nessuno mi giudica per il mio inglese, mi lascio un po' pi andare, ma rimango sempre molto cauta!    A me personalmente piace approfondire la conoscenza di una lingua fino all'eccellenza....forse perch studio lingue all'universit, perci anche la pronuncia deve essere il pi perfetta possibile...ma forse anche perch adoro le lingue straniere e mi piacerebbe avvicinarmi il pi possibile all'inglese parlato dai nativi!   Comunque il fidanzato irlandese di una mia amica, le ha detto che per loro  carino sentire noi stranieri parlare con un accento diverso (a suo dire, l'accento italiano  molto bello...) e perci non capiva il perch ci sforzassimo tanto di parlare esattamente (o quasi!) come loro!|`|lirZckkCaa	mi butto mi butto e mi butto  Tanto il primo approccio ritengo che sia sempre il metodo migliore per imparare una lingua..

Ovviamente se si tratta di utilizzare le conoscenze linguistiche in ambito lavorativo cerco di saperle bene e di prepararmi al meglio.

N9VN9bwfaa	It's only been in recent years that some people associated the two.  In ancient times nobody did.  Werewolves were one of a large set of beasties that were therianthropes, part animal and part human.  They have a long and interesting history, going back to the Paleolithic.  You can see various types of therianthropes on cave walls in France, at Lascaux -- a bison man, for instance, and on a spearshaft straightened found in the Dordogne, which is probably an ibex man, and there's even a yam man from Australia.  There's a bird man from Siberia, carved into a rock, and several eland men and elephant headed men in South Africa, painted by the ancestors of the San people who are now forced to live in the Kalahari desert but who once lived all over the southern part of the continent.  This is related to the trance dances of the shaman who heals the sick, seeks game, and controls the weather while in a trance.  It's part of the most ancient form of religion.  You know, the oldest sculpture in the world is even a Loewenmensch, or lion man, from Germany.    But now vampires, they're much younger.  Slavic and Greek people thought those up after digging up graves and finding that some corpses didn't look decayed enough.  They thought the dead must have been getting up at night and helping themselves to some fresh blood.  Really it was because the soil was colder there or something like that.  But while they were at it, the folks who dug the bodies up helped themselves to old uncle Shmenky's gold ring and his nice boots.  So people kept on saying, "Yeah, I haven't been well,  I think aunt Zsa Zsa might be a vampire too.  So let's dig HER up."  And while the villagers were off finding a nice, thick piece of wood to nail her down with, the folks who'd done the complaining made off with auntie Zsa Zsa's gold rings and HER boots.  So it was a very handy "belief."|`|4NV4bew9aa	They were not until the twentieth century.|`|ymWbNFPtaa	They both bite people to infect them and make more werewolves or vampires.|`|IcxeWNNCaa	in Reference to haller the reason ppl associated vampires with werewolves was because it was long ago believed that werewolves could come back from the dead as vampires so as to lay with their widowed wives|`|kugv1L8waa	just in the last few years they have been. oh, i'm told the movie underworld started this off.|`|EY6EJSNOaa	Because Vampires are COOL!!! and Warewolfs *cough* (Jacob) are soooo NOT.  so   COOL vs soooo NOT cool|`|kyBz7Rlmaa	in medieval days it was believed that if you didn't cut off a werewolf's head and toss it into a running river than it would come back as a vampire|`|AA12384132	Because both of those paranormal creature were cursed by God...

I would move now rather than take the chance that some minor issue will crop up which will make the "nuclear pile" go "critical" and then having to deal with the fallout.

We all have 'patterns' in the way we form relationships, some 'successful', some not.  What we have to do is accept the fact that even though the other person may be at 'fault' there are certain things we can correct in ourselves.  We can change the sort of relationships we are prepared to put up with, even the way that we inter-act with people in our relationships.  So, the short of it all is relationships don't have to be pointless and temporary, unless we make them that way!|`|dtXzOGoKaa	that's how i feel at the moment but who knows what my situation will be in the future|`|1493ba4d2afccb99fa48986b490234c0aa	in the big scale of things temporary yes i suppose but not pointless.  That is a sad lonely view. Maybe you have never loved and been loved in the right way.|`|w05TELqAaa	Pointless - never: you can always learn SOMETHING from a situation.  Temporary - well yes, everything's temporary: that doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.|`|1TT9oiO0aa	No it's not true. Relationships aren't pointless - they teach you, give you experiences. When you end a relationship, it's not because it's been "pointless" - you will learn from your mistakes and go to someone else.     Relationships can be temporary (people break up, move on, break up again, etc) but then when they find the right person it is not temporary - it is forever. |`|nChtooMEaa	I hope not|`|hUbETXKpaa	no you obviously havent been in love yet|`|573WbT3zaa	All relationships are temporary but definately not pointless. Even just a good sexy time is a good point for a relationship, even if it is temporary|`|92a9415700fd70cfec8209a7ebda387eaa	Even the temporary relationships teach you something and therefor are not pointless.  |`|axfCCEooaa	Sometimes it feels that way! But no im sure there is someone for everyone (i hope!)|`|jwT20biwaa	That is a very sweeping statement that is calling on an answer with too many variables.    No all relationships are not pointless. I am sure that most people enter a relationship with the best of intentions.    Are they temporary again when one enters into a relationship unless they give a maximum time line they enter into believing it will be forever.     I know of several long term LGBT relationships. All over twenty years and one over forty years. Do you still call them temporary?|`|d7700e32c034b0231bc54ef45dd9e791aa	i believe they are but i am bitter lol?|`|bmo2aGbdaa	Relationships are not pointless.  You can learn something about yourself from every relationship, even the bad ones.  This will then alter how you deal with relationships in the future, hopefully for the better.|`|loGCCEI6aa	no, you just havent found the right one|`|iR25zB4paa	Nope......|`|7WH2ij9zaa	Most of them are, and you must endure a myriad of them until the right one comes along.

DFrzrmiDaa	It is forbidden and the obvious reason is Islam put clear focus on the norms of society, if society is corrupt the whole nation goes down, pre-marriage relations are one of the things that destract the focus of a person from his true way , the righteous way i.e. Islam. That is why islam prefers the marriages of children in early age so they will not indulge in sins. One of the disadvantage of this premarriage relationship is AIDS which western world is facing now, if you are talking about only friendship before marriage that is difficult to maintain & it will eventually lead to ........ so there is no other shortcut except an Islamic Nikkah.|`|mxIYhkAnaa	hehehe you can find a person that will start a pre marriage relationship, but not a Godfearing wife that seeks only a blessing through marriage?    Make saum or you should adopt other wishes about your soon-to-become wife...|`|AYs6iFlLaa	Iam going to get thumbs down for this ,but LOVE is not a requirement for marriage. Find someone who is a pious Muslim to marry, Allah will give you the rest. I knew my Husband for a very short time before we were married but every day is new and we fall more and more in love every day. Seek Allah's will for your life not , the desires you have.|`|qPSkkPqwaa	Hey buddy let me correct you.    Allah has created everyone in pairs..  And our beloved prophet (PBUH) said celibacy is not allowed. (i.e there is no position for a NUN in islam).    If some one dies before marriage or consumatting the marriage he is indeed somewhat relieved. Because Death is a gift to muslims..Relief from this wordly life and going into the pleasant paradise or horrendous hell.    Look for religious person. If the person is religious and obviously we are prone to desires. So it is never like a person is never attracted or desires sex. Everyone does at different level. WHen something is bothering someone, he/she wont have sex at that time. Or it wud be called a dull pleasure !    In Jannah u can fulfill ur fantasies (in lawful manner).     If cannot find - then do salatul istakhara couple of times, obey Allah and His Messenger (saws) (i.e follow sunnah)  INsha;allah u will find her/he.|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	Keep looking. It's not a good idea to stay celibate, but it's far worse to commit zina. Man and woman alone together are never truly alone, shaytan is the 3rd. If you don't want to remain celibate, find someone and get married!|`|CQz8dMzFaa	Dont worry, relax and be happy. If you worry too much about finding something, you dont notice it even if its next to you sipping coffee.|`|N8QLKpCMaa	yes , its not alowed but an adult may show his/her wish to marry a desired person , they tell parents n can get it !   yes islam doesnt like celibacy , but gives space to the natural phenomina as of relationship of man n women, consult some one elder relative or mosque person , get and arranged marriage if you get a good n faithful wife you will get all trust,love,understanding.    LET ALLAH DECIDE WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU !  OR   MAKE A CHOICE N LEAVE UPON GOD .|`|DO7lDtqxaa	There is someone for everyone.  I do believe Allah knows best and will not give us more than we can bare.|`|GM0kOZpRaa	no, it's like people go over the limmits and forbid alot more than needed.  it's not haram to have freinds, it's not haram to hang out, so do that as ur little pre-marital marrige.|`|1rX7HB8Qaa	yeah,ok, according to Islam, when you like someone you tell everyone about it and then send your relatives to tell her parents that you want to marry her. but wait a second! how would you know what she is by personality? what if after marriage you find out that she is not the one you are looking for? come on man, these days you cant say how a person is by seeing her face. you have to go out in order to know whether she is suitable for you. i know dating is allowed in Islam as long as you are taking a relative with you to meet her. what if she stays fake? there is a lot to ponder about actually.

nEzK1FuPaa	ciao.....    riesco a capire la tua situazione, l' asessualit  l'orientamento sessuale meno frequente nella popolazione, e a volte potrebbe risultare molto difficile trovare qualcun altro nella tua stessa condizione.    Per quanto riguarda la domanda se l'asessualit dura per sempre, credo che la risposta sia si, infatti tutti gli orientamenti sessuali sono fissi e non cambiabili, e se qualcuno afferma che esistono persone che hanno cambiato orientamento, vuol dire che non erano veramente di quell'orientamento....    quindi se un gorno scoprirai di provare attrazione per qualcuno ( uomo e/o donna che sia) vuol dire che non eri mai stato veramente asessuale :-)    ciao!|`|LbVJAPwdaa	ma non si sa realmente quanta...gente fa le cose per fare ma alla fine si perde...|`|IHZrGAmvaa	MEGLIO FAR SESSO|`|1WqpLkIHaa	mmm..  a volte sono asessuato anch'io  ..solo a volte|`|QvJeYb9Naa	BENEFICI DEL SESSO         1.

sAIfI1pHaa	Aren't you missing the point a little?     It's to educate people about how these people have been oppressed and have taken a stand for equal rights.    Maybe you should pay a little more attention to the '...history months'..you may learn something!|`|bpYqg3Dsaa	All the 'black' **** that we have to listen to really gets on my t*ts. If we were to put 'white' history month, we would be penalised for it - its all a load of bulls**t.    I am a woman, and we have now got more than equality, so why not leave it right there - stop banging on about equality. YOU'VE GOT IT NOW SO LET IT GO, GROW UP AND GET A LIFE!!!!!|`|b5d5329923e8ca4ef6a88603c0a8f8b3aa	thats ridiculous.... let em do what they want.  i dont pay any attention to it.    what messes me up is my girlie is a product of womens lib and want full equality in all aspects but she wants to break up because she does not 'feel like a girl'
SDHmVDlNaa	They are doing it on purpose but you will never be able to prove it because they would deny it to the moon if you were to ask them.  They would say that they forgot or that they thought that is what you said or often they twist it back on you and tell you that you told them the wrong thing in the first place.  That you told them something else and that they were just following what you said in the first place and that you were the one who said it incorrectly.  Or they will just change things a little bit and suddenly it is all your fault.  They are supremely good at this too.   I would love to know why they do this and yes I think they do have some sort of problem. They can't own up to their own mistakes and they are almost perverse in doing exactly the opposite of what you want them to do. What you have to do is stop trying to control them in anyway.  They hate control of any sort. A book that might help is "People of the lie" by Scott Peck. It helped me deal with those people in my life who are like this.|`|3uGcqN2Eaa	Personally I think that they are subliminally disregarding your advice out of a lack of respect for you.    Just make a note in the future to see if they do the same thing when they are dealing with a different person. |`|NaNplX1naa	Yes it seems. many people have this kind of tendency in born or developed due to age or tension. most of them have poor road memory or poor memory for recalling names or phone numbers. with practice it can be gradually cured. people pass their life going around telling about it that they have poor memory.|`|yDfbQOTjaa	if they are old they are forgetful, otherwise they are passive agressive and just trying to not do what you tell them|`|SDNADb9eaa	Well, I think this person does not have a problem, but wants attention.   By annoying other people accidentally-on-purpose, they know that they're getting attention, even if it's negative attention.    Anyway, tell them how you feel, and ask why they do it.  Don't worry, they have no problem.    Good luck =)|`|vwZfpRgqaa	It's funny. I find this is more of a characteric of certain people. Some people are so headstrong they will completely disregard any advice(or direction, in your example) to prove that they could find their own way through the sinaro, therefore proving no matter what they can get handle things on their own with no help at all. Now, if we are talking medically, something wrong I wouldn't know, but now a days there is a diagnosis for everything

Really, how could there be such a thing, but if you're mostly attracted to one gender, and maybe only a little turned on by the other, maybe it'd be a better fit, no?  Bi-Sexual makes it sound as if you are equally attracted to both, and maybe you aren't.  Also, maybe you are emotionally attracted only to one, while physically attracted to both.  Humans aren't really on a straight continuum about these things, it's really more curved, or round, right?    So, how then you know if you are "Bi"?  Well, bi means two, or in case like this, liking of both.  So do you like both?  Being attracted to both does not mean you must sleep with both, only what's comfortable for YOU as individual!

AA10627391	I've gone on two separate retreats, and they have both been essential to my walk with Christ.    The first one was geared more towards Jesus' 2nd greatest commandment- Love your neighbor as yourself.  While I was there, I got to learn about God's grace through a series of talks and discussions.  It was a weekend to get away from cell phones, work, school, and the stress of everyday life.  In the end, I witnessed God's desire for us to love one another through an incredible community of people who were once in my position, and were now "paying it forward".    The other one I went on was geared towards Jesus' 1st commandment- Love God with all your heart, soul, and mind.  It was a weekend where we sang songs, ate good food, learned about sin, and we had opportunities after each lesson to leave our sins on the cross.      In both instances, we had celebrations afterwards where we could reflect on how God spoke to us during the retreat.  It was a refreshing time and it was necessary for those of us who needed to be recharged and re-energized for this long walk called "life".    I pray that you will have a lot of fun and learn much while you are refreshed during this time.|`|skNbOi4Daa	Optional talks/meditations  Collective Worship  Private meditation/ prayer  Lots of peace and quiet  No phone or hassle etc!

7ca44a3727786e789f15a19554574c39aa	To tell you the truth, MOST Islamic women don't turn me on WITH or WITHOUT the headscarf    And if they were true "foxes" I'd get turned on even by the eyes, which are allowed to be seen!|`|uBICgcbAaa	No the hijab isn't supposed to make you unattractive.  It's supposed to keep you modest and in Islam the modesty of women is valued so much that they should wear hijab and abaya outside because they shouldn't show their beauty to strange men except for their fathers, husbands, sons and brothers.  The point of wearing the abaya and hijab is to protect the women from herself and protect her from the world and to guard her chastity and modesty and keep her from getting raped or killed by strange men and because ALLAH(SWT) commands all believing women and girls to cover everything except the eyes in the Qur'an and  a strong Hadith and lets other people respect them and let them be know as believe modest Muslim women and not to be annoyed.|`|uqnfGqm8aa	Please read first this before such questions.  Why Bible try to shave the head of un-veiled woman?  1 Corinthians 11:6 KJV: For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.    Why Bible declares thats woman is bitter than death?  Ecclesiastes 7:26 KJV: And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her but she will catch whoever continues to sin. (GOD'S WORD?)    Why Bible advise to Burn the Daughter of Priest if she does sex?  Leviticus 21:9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.  A priest's daughter, if found to have lost her virginity without marriage, can receive the death penalty, but in the form of incineration.  How many fundamentalist priests who so easily condemn others would carry out the burning of their daughters if they found them "whoring"?    Why Bible want to set a fire on woman?  Genesis 38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she [is] with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.  A priest's daughter, if found to have lost her virginity without marriage, can receive the death penalty, but in the form of incineration.  How many fundamentalist priests who so easily condemn others would carry out the burning of their daughters if they found them "whoring"?    Why Bible wants to Cut the hands of wife if she support her husband? Because she is woman?  Deuteronomy 25:11-12 "When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets: then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity her." A wife would naturally wish to come to the aid of her husband in any way she could if he desperately struggled with an opponent, but the Hebrew law specifically forbade a wife to help her husband in distress if that support consisted of her grabbing the enemy's genitals in an effort to stifle his onslaught. The penalty? Amputation of the hand that fondled the genitals!  Only in an overly obsessive male dominated culture could men create such atrocious laws. As such, the penis ranked sacrosanct in the minds of men (as it still stands today). If a male lost his penis for any reason, he would lose the right to enter a congregation of God. (See Deuteronomy 23:1)    Why Bible chooses Penalty for Female Births?  Are all dames dirty?  Leviticus 12:2  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.  Leviticus 12:5  But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.  A woman who gives birth to a child must undergo a purification ritual lest her "uncleanness" contaminate others. This not only entails her isolation, but also payments to priests for the ritual acts. Thus the male dominators had even made birth dirty.  Notice here that if a woman bears a female child, her isolation must last twice as long as that if she gives birth to a male child! (See also Psalms 51:3-5)    Why Bible declares, Females are in Inferior than males?  I Corinthians 11:3 "But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God."   The Bible's decree of male supremacy has kept woman inferior to men for centuries. For the religious, it comes as a sad fact that a human must have a penis to receive any respect or power within the Church.  All woman should realize that such phrases in the Bible has justified for many Christian men, not only their supremacy but a reason to sexually abuse women. (See also I Cor. 14:34-36, I Timothy 2:8-15, I Peter 3:1-7, Ephesians 5:22-24, Col. 3:18-19)    Why Bible declares male supremacy over females?  I Corinthians 11:8-9 "For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man."   The Bible's decree of male supremacy has kept woman inferior to men for centuries. For the religious, it comes as a sad fact that a human must have a penis to receive any respect or power within the Church.  All woman should realize that such phrases in the Bible has justified for many Christian men, not only their supremacy but a reason to sexually abuse women. (See also I Cor. 14:34-36, I Timothy 2:8-15, I Peter 3:1-7, Ephesians 5:22-24, Col. 3:18-19)    Bible wants to kill illegitimate Children. How you can punish innocent children?  Revelation 2:22-23 "Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works."   If anyone thinks Biblical Jesus represents only a peaceful loving soul, then think again. For an act of adultery, Bible would kill innocent children for the adultery of others; hardly fair justice, love, or the concern for human beings. Bible wants to kill adulterous population of Bible Believers. Adulterous population has substantial ratio in Bible Believers.There are more than 41% love children in American population. If you believe in bible, half of Christian populat|`|5LoFzetDaa	Ugh...wow.|`|atE3E4YQaa	It's worn to conceal for the purpose of modesty, not as an attempt to look unattractive.      Concealment is all relative.  You wouldn't go out of the house with your breasts hanging out.  A Muslim women won't go out of the house with her head exposed.|`|68b36c91580e7adf9c960fbc213909afaa	No ,headscarf usage is not to make you look unattractive infact people tend to look cuter .    Yes when you wear the headscarf people stare at you ,coz it is a rare sight.People get interested coz they mostly see  women without one and probably they wonder in awe "this girl surely has the faith and the patience to adhere to her religion".    So they look at you with the same curiosity as you and i would when we see something of rarity.    Headscarf sends signals of modesty.    Headscarf alone will not suffice.My friend once wore a headscarf but she also wore a capri(half pant)  That causes the loss of the very intention of "headscarfing".|`|AA11646407	One can only do what we can to ourselves.  We cannot change what others think or do.  What I am trying to say is that one cannot change what the other person does as a result of something that I am doing.      The scarf / hijaab or any type of clothes are not supposed to flaunt your beauty / or certain parts that can be attractive.  Some Muslim cultures like many countries of the Middle East, the women cover more; whereas other countries, like Malaysia, Indonesia, India and Pakistan, females cover less.    The modesty or the scarf has a dual purpose: to exclusively reserve those highly precious things for the one you love - your husband, and to make the female less of an object.  When people converse and think about them, they don't think of them as a sex object, but rather, they think about them as a PERSON and think about their actions, words and substance.      Alas, Nuns wear a scarf / hijaab, too.|`|f3285d3535d7a9238d129068a24cbca0aa	hmm. Well without giving you a answer here like many that goes off on tangent without answering the question..    It's the type of attention that women who don't cover that is not allowed. You can't dress in Islam that the glances you get are comming from people who see you as eye candy. The attention you are talking about is different hun. It's the "curiosity", not in anyway lustful.    Also the woman who just cover their head are wrong. The word hijab doesnt mean head scarf, it means to cover. so if she wears a hijab the rest of her has to be covered to and I agree many Muslim sisters dont do that, but many do.    Also, A hijab has many other reasons besides not trying to catch a mans attention. It promotes you to be equal to men, So that it is your mind that is in focus. Also, your basically supposed to because its mandatory and a sign of a persons faith ... Just like the jewish men wear the Yamaka.    Thanks for the post. Better to ask then to assume|`|2e859d32fe514ed3486570d4ec58b1e9aa	Hijab (the head scarf) is not meant to make a woman unattractive.  It is meant to protect her modesty from men who are not her husband or family.  I am sure that in some areas of the world the scarf attracts attention from those who are curious.

Our country could be out of debt by taxing it. It would also be grown by the government, so you wouldn't have to worry about it being laced with anything. As far as health issues, it's better than cigarettes. Also, there has never been a death caused by over dosing on marijuana! It's not possible.

One such place to look would be Deuteronomy 18:9-12, which says (in part):  "There should not be   anyone . . . who uses DIVINATION, a practicer of MAGIC,  anyone who looks for OMENS, or a SORCERER,  or one who binds others with a SPELL, or anyone who consults a SPIRIT MEDIUM or a professional FORTUNE TELLER. or anyone who inquires of the DEAD.   For everybody doing these things is  detestable to Jehovah God..."    Of course, Satan is the ruler of this world (1 John 5:19; 2 Corinthians 4:4), but the above is something to contemplate if you wish to be on God's side . . .

c4f6ea51c611e4f2579483a73bba738eaa	Io credo che solo un buon rapporto con se stessi possa preparare adeguatamente alla vita.    E se  vero - come  vero - che l'aver gi affrontate difficolt di varia natura possa aiutare, ai GRANDI dolori della vita non si potr MAI opporre efficacemente la nostra precedente esperienza, sviluppata in altri mbiti pi "normali", pi controllabili e meno devastanti.   E, soprattutto, ben diversi.     I grandi dolori sono naturale ed umana conseguenza di grandi gioie: perch si soffre sempre in rapporto a quanto si  gioto, ed ovviamente pi dolore abbiamo provato e pi grande potr essere la nostra gioia in certe fasi della nostra vita.    La miserabile abitudine che tanti genitori hanno, oggi, di evitare le difficolt ai loro figli, riempiendoli di molto pi di ci che serve, finisce per renderli deboli e sempre insoddisfatti, e COMPLETAMENTE INCAPACI di affrontare un dolore, una perdita, una difficolt.    A mio figlio insegno a cadere, certo, ma soprattutto insegno a camminare, con la dovuta attenzione, prudenza e coscienza delle proprie possibilit.   E rammentandogli sempre che DI TUTTO potr accadere, ma che se sapr mantenere il proprio equilibrio con se stesso NULLA gli potr impedire di vivere con soddisfazione e dignit la propria vita.

Il dolore fisico passa con opportune terapie, ma  pronto a tornare non appena la patologia si ripresenta.  E spesso le ricadute sono pi dolorose dell'evento precedente.  Il dolore spirituale - qualsiasi tipo di dolore - tende invece a diminuire ed annullarsi col tempo, ma non ci immunizza contro nuovi eventi negativi.

436a7092e684a586bb1403d2a2c07e0eaa	I THINK that God does exist because it is not believable to me that we all turned up here during this 'big bang' or so called evolution from monkeys or apes..  It was something started out by two people created by God (who also created the heavens, earth, everything from bacteria to giant trees)to pretty much populate the world and build generations (this is ALL from the Bible).  That is what i think, others have there own opinions and beliefs .. this is just mine!  so i do believe in God and that he exists even though we cannot see him, it's a matter of belief|`|0101eb23399738fea6cb3034ddfa4659aa	What I think is that God does indeed exist. The reason I think this way is because of what I know. What I know is that God exists. You never asked for reasons but there are plenty. Mostly, the evidence of changed lives but then again, you never asked.|`|283f74a3d7fa17a75eeba8f2cfdc8076aa	Yes, He does.

But they all come down to one of two things...faith or facts.    Study the good books...not the anti ones, and then pray and ask if they are true.  Faith is like a tree...it needs nourishment to grow...and it grows slowly...    I believe God exists.  both on faith and with fact.    Even the greatest minds concluded there is a God.|`|f720c389a8d82362e77517e694f3e0fdaa	Yes, He does.  I do not have enough faith to believe that everything could exist as it does without a higher power.  The great mathematician and philosopher, Blaise Pascal, came up with what is called Pascal's Wager.  The idea is that believing God is, whether or not He does, offers a greater benefit than believing He does not, whether He does or not.  Here is a simplified version found on Wikipedia:  "You may believe in God, and if God exists, you go to heaven: your gain is infinite.   You may believe in God, and if God doesn't exist, your loss is finite and therefore negligible.   You may not believe in God, and if God doesn't exist, your gain is finite and therefore negligible.   You may not believe in God, and if God exists, you will go to hell: your loss is infinite."

By all means, they should be the most depressed, hungry, saddest people living on earth. WHY in the WORLD would anyone want to make their lives more miserable than they already are? Some of them had families, HAVE families, and were ok earlier in life. They once had something. Think of how embarrased you might be to be suddenly living in the street, with no one to help or care for you, having to rely on old scraps, unsanitary conditions that you can do ABSOLUTELY nothing about. Can't wash. Can't get clean water. No one wants you around them or in their store or in their library. Refusing you service. Some unfortunate circumstance put them out into the cold, like illness, or the loss of a job, or the loss of family.     They were once a loved baby. Think about that.

Anthropologists will tell you race is something created by man, not a true biological construct. Secondly, I don't get why so many Persians WANT people to think they look Italian or French, but they get so offended when someone mistakes them for an Arab, Indian or Latino (and just as many of them look like that as look Italian). Is Persian culture sort of racist? Or are they ashamed of being Persian? I'm sure there is a lot to be proud of, so why try to be something else?

AA10937078	Educational scholorships, grants and awards and other opportunities should depend on the personal motivation of the INDIVIDUAL, not based on the history of the group he or she came from.    Scholarships should be granted on apptitude and high school grades.  Color or ethnicity should NOT be involved.    An African American student whose married parents are educated professionals is better prepared for academic success than the white kids who grew up in a single parent household surviving barely above poverty level.  The white kid is the one who needs the extra help, not the black kid.    So, in that case why should the African American kid have the perks, and not the white kid from a poor family?    Family income is more important in granting scholarships and grants than the color or ethnicity.|`|AA11101361	Many scholarships are given by private organizations who can give them to anyone they want.  There are scholarships for people with a certain last name, whose parents or grandparents held a certain job,  left handers, peopel who have certain medical conditions, people who are obese, who are majoring in a specific subjects, or based on a certain religion.  It makes sense that the NAACP would only give scholarships to black students (incidentally, a friend in college had an NAACP scholarship ONLY if she attended a traditionally black university and the scholarship was $500) or that the Association on American Indian Affairs would only give scholarship to native Americans (although a lot of white kids try to get these).  Skin color means nothing in regards to mental ability, yes.  But historically a lot of people with dark skin have been financially unable to attend colleges.  Public scholarships are available to anyone who meets the requirements and the only restriction is generally scholastic ability, achievement or major.  A private organization can say "We will only give scholarships to Asians who are Jewish, have eczema, and whose fathers were killed in a fire."|`|df8a0f84bbe85abc93bcd5f6df2e3130aa	I agree with you and I wish more people would.

atE3E4YQaa	Moloch is a pagan God, it used to be worshiped by the 'idolaters' in the old testament days.  It is definately not related to Satan, although it is true that original Moloch worship involved throwing children into bonfires.

We die, for life to be meaningful. If we could live forever, then eventually everything interesting would be meaningless. Everything would be nothing to us. We always think that time is precious, that is only because each of us has only a limited amount of it. There would be no concept of time, if we had a perpetual amount of it.

I seek refuge with Allah from the punishment of the grave.    AL BARZAKH - The Barrier  (Bismillah ir Rahman ir Rahim)     Upon death the organic body ceases to exist and will eventually decompose. The soul however, remains intact and does not die with its physical counterpart. The Angel of Death and the angels under his authority who are entrusted with extraction of the soul at the time of death, do so at the precisely appointed time. This is the decree of Allah, as stated in the Qur'an:     "And no person can ever die except by Allah's Leave and at an appointed time" (Al-Imran:145)     Once removed, the soul no longer participates in the life or affairs of this world but enters into the next stage of existence. This stage is called AL BARZAKH in Arabic.  Al Barzakh literally means The Barrier or The Partition and has been mentioned in the Qur'an:     "Until when death comes to one of them (those who join partners with Allah), he says: My Lord! Send me back. So that Imay do good in that which I left behind! No! It is but a word that he speaks, and behind them is a Barzakh (a barrier) until the day when they are raised up" (Al-Muminun:99-100)     The soul now exists in its third abode. The first being the mother womb, the second being the short life of this world. According to Islam, human beings (and Jinn) will be ressurected on the Day of Judgement. In between death and the Day of Judgement, the soul remains in Al Barzakh.     In this domain there is no time frame, this is similar to the state of sleep during which the perception of time is lost. Time itself is an enigma and cannot truly be understood. Allah is the Creator of it and He controls it.     Whilst in the realms of the Barzakh, the soul has no communication with the world of the living. Islam is explicitly clear about this, the souls of the deceased do not and cannot hear the living people. Allah states in the Qur'an:     "Verily, you cannot make the dead hear" (An-Naml:80)     "The living and the dead are not alike. Allah makes whoever He wishes hear, but you cannot make those in their graves hear" (Fatir;22)     There is no concept of asking the deceased about anything or anyone. The erroneous belief that the departed souls can hear or communicate with the living has led to the occult practise of trying to summon the dead through seances and mediums. This type of activity is a branch of magic and is a major sin in Islam. The dead cannot affect or avail the living, and have no bearing on the affairs of this world.     Christianity too condemns magic and magicians. In the old Testament it clearly states: "A man or a woman who is a medium or a wizard shall be put to death; they shall be stoned with stones; their blood shall be put upon them" (Leviticus 20:27). However, typical of its contradictory nature, elsewhere the Bible details the summoning of the Prophet Samuel's deceased soul: "Saul disguised himself and pleaded to the woman, 'I have got to talk to a dead man. will you bring his spirit up?' The woman replied, 'Are you trying to get me killed? King Saul has had all mediums and fortune tellers executed' Finally the woman agreed, 'Who shall I summon?' Saul replied, 'I want the Prophet Samuel'. When Samuel was summoned he asked 'Why have you disturbed me by bringing me back?' Saul replied, 'Because I am in deep trouble. The Phillistines are at war with us, and God has left me and will not reply by prophets or dreams, so I have called upon you to ask you what to do" (1 Samuel:8-15)     In Islam, praying to the dead or invoking the departed souls is a manifestation of idolatry. since to seek assistance from another agent beside Allah is an implication that there are forces that can affect life and events alongside Allah. As in the above Biblical verse, King Saul had earned the wrath of God and had been forsaken so he had turned to another agent for help, in this case the departed soul of Prophet Samuel.  The Biblical verse indicates that summoning the dead is an acheivable activity through which one can derive some benefit or knowledge.  Islamically, this is not the case. Souls cannot be summoned and no benefit can be derived. For those who do engage in activities like seances and the ouija board and experienced paranormal incidents, the Prophet Muhammad (saas) gave very detailed explanation as to how the jinn fool human beings into thinking that a deceased soul has been summoned.     Islam is clear and uncompromising with its stance with seeking divine help through other than Allah. Allah does not share His Authority with anything or anyone. Governing the affairs  of creation solely belongs to Him. Further to this if any of Allah's attributes are ascribed to other than Him, then this is idolatry, known in Arabic as SHIRK. Allah states in the Qur'an:     "Say (O Muhammad) to those who worship others beside Allah, 'Call upon those you claim are worthy of worship besides Allah. They do not have any power to remove harm from you at all, not even to move it away to someone else" (Al-Isra:56)     Christianity is considered to be a monotheistic religion, yet orthodox Christians and Roman Catholics regularly pray and invoke saints for the fulfillment of their needs. Most other Christians pray to Jesus Christ instaed of God. From an Islamic veiwpoint this is polytheism and not monotheism. Allah states in the Qur'an:     "And most of them do not believe in Allah except while joining partners to Him" (Yusuf:106)     Every form of idolatry and polytheism major or minor is rejected and cursed:     "And indeed it has been revealed to you and to those before you, if you practise shirk, surely all your deeds will be in vain" (Az-Zumar:65)     The human being is easily misguided into worshipping ot|`|dnKQmfqnaa	no. I will be with Jesus.|`|P0efRBlOaa	nope...theres no reason :)|`|yHLhC8DLaa	I have almost always look at death as a part of life.  We all do it some day.   I don't want to do it anytime soon only out of concern for my family.  When God is ready to take me I will be ready.  And I don't really see a Heaven as described in churches and the Bible to some extent.  And I wonder if this could be Hell for some that are unfortunate and mistreated in this world.

Gli atei si sono scandalizzati, e anche noi credenti abbiamo detto "questo  un intollerante: non siamo tutti cos". Tu invece chiedi come si fa a distruggere le religioni, e molti ti dicono "bravo". So che ci sono tanti atei coerenti e tolleranti. Si facciano sentire. Siete contenti di avere cos tanti intolleranti? Vi rappresentano? Mi auguro che molti rispondano di no a tutte e due le domande. Oltre che tu hai citato(impropiamente) gli Istituti di religione. E il papa non  Dio. Noi non adoriamo il papa o la Chiesa. Sappiamo che possono sbagliare(e lo hanno fatto tantissimo) Ficcatevelo in testa!!!!!!! Noi crediamo a dio. La Chiesa che seguiamo, la parte sacra della Chiesa,  quella che riguarda solo la Religione(la Messa la domenica, la corretta interpretazione della Bibbia). Tutto il resto non ci riguarda, e non riguarda nemmeno la Chiesa, riguarda solo il papa e i preti che sono al vertice della Chiesa. La religione, come hanno detto gli altri, ha portato tanto bene, tutti i diritti che sono stati poi laicizzati. L'ottuso e l'ignorante sei solo tu. Come fai a dire che Dio non esiste? E' molto pi difficile dimostrare che una cosa non c', piuttosto che dimostrare che c'. E poi se veramente il cristianesimo fosse una bugia, l'avremmo fatta cos bene, che tu non puoi dimostrare che  una bugia! E non potrai mai,  solo una tua supposizione, non hai prove certe al 100%.

CZYXO1NFaa	Yes I 100% fully believe in miracles. I've seen miracles in my own life, but they are very special to me and I am reluctant to share them in R&S.    I will tell you that prayer works, God does listen! Having faith will in those prayers will make the difference, and in the end we just have to trust that whatever happens is in the wisdom and love of God.    Good luck to you and your friend. Ill keep her in my prayers.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	yes, ever so very strongly.|`|my8S2g04aa	My life is a miracle, as seen here:    I was raised A "HARDCORE" Catholic for the first 18 years of my life. But I grew very tired of the same old routine, every Sunday. It wasn't until, a member of my church choir gave me a book called "666", by Salem Kirban, that my life would change forever! In the back of that book was the Salvation Invitation. After reading the book, (& being totally freaked-out by it!), I signed my name after the prayer, & became a Believer. That was 1973!    All through college, I was actively involved in both Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship, & Campus Crusade for Christ. I really made some very close friends during those years!    It wasn't until after I had graduated from college, (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Class of December '79), that things really went "south" for me!    After my one & only job in my major, (Bachelor of Fine Arts-Technical Theatre), bombed, I started working at another place. I met a girl there, who when I told her that I was still a virgin-well, that was all she needed! She lead me around like the proverbial "bull-with-a-ring-through-it's-nose". (Remember, I had been a HARDCORE Catholic for my first 18 years, & was taught those 18 years-that if I even LOOKED at a woman, I was going to Hell, & then I was a Believer for over, at that time, 4 years-so still no sex). She kept promising me sex, but as I was to discover, she never had any intention of fufilling that "promise". When she dumped me, to say I was devastated, would be an understatement!    Looking back on all this, I think the reason I fell away from my Lord for so long, was because, I didn't have the close Christian fellowship, that I had had at college!    I fell away from the Lord hard after that! Over 20+years, to be exact!    I was extremely racist, I had a hatred for woman, that was, (to say the least), unflattering, I had a mouth that would make most gangsta' rappers cringe, & most of all-I had a hatred for God, that lead to my practically cursing Him 24/7! Not a pretty picture, is it?    Oh yes-I also tried to kill myself over 2 dozen time, as well! Everything from Pills, to knives, to carbon Monoxide, even to dousing myself with gasoline & being within millimeters of striking the match!    My job situation wasn't any better! I went from one job to the next, never setting down roots anywhere for very long!    Well, I had a job, (this was after I moved to Madison), that I thought was ideal! Everybody was very happy with the work that I was doing, & I felt, for the first time in my life-satisfied with my life. Well, I was unjustly accused of something at this job, & that was the straw that broke the proverbial "camels" back! I ended up swallowing 30 sleeping pills, & ended up in the emergency room of one of the hospitals here! And what did I get out of it-a $1400 hospital bill, that it took FOREVER to pay off!    Looking back on this, I DO realize that it was indeed the Lord, telling me to get my rear-end over to the hospital, although I didn't realize it at the time.    Well, after a long string of temp jobs, I was ready to try suicide again, & this time, I was determined to get it right! I had hit rock bottom. No money, no job, nothing! In my apartment building, I had discovered the internet, because they have a small computer lab here. I now know that it WAS indeed the Lords leading here as well, when I came across a Christian website called Theology Online. Eventually, after trying to disprove Christianity, unsuccessfully I might add, I finally mustered enough courage to ask the people there to pray for me, which they did, because I was really depressed! As I said earlier, it was the Lord that lead me to TOL as well! What surprised me was I even interested in a Christian website, when I hated God so much! Well, HE didn't hate me!    Finally, I was ready to get the whole suicide thing right one & for all! I told the Lord that I would give Him one more chance to help me, if He even cared!    Well, the Lord again, (Although again, I didn't realize it at the time-sound familiar?), lead me to look in the Yellow pages for a church that had, of all things, a Satuday night service, which I thought was little bit strange. That church was Evangel Life Center-the same church that I am still attending, almost 3 years later! I went there, & sat in the back of the sanctuary. I wasn't there more than 10-15 minutes, when 3 wonderful women came over to talk to me. I told them why I was there, & what I was planning to do. They both prayed for & with me, & like the proverbial "prodigal son, THIS prodigal son finally came back to the the Family of God! That date was 1/11/03-a date that I will never forget!    Since that time I have had both ups & downs, like we all have. The "ups" side was fantastic! I had gained an absolutely fearlessness in witnessing-eventually, which lead to my witnessing not just to one person, but to groups of people, both at work & at my apartment building as well! What was really cool, was that I just knew exactly what to say! I KNOW that that was the Lord working through me, because I was so totally surrendered to the Lord, it was the greatest experience in my life, that 2 of the people that I had a chance to witness to actually received the Lord as Lord & Savior ON THE SAME DAY! *WOW*    But I also have had some major "down" times as well! I did backslide for 6-7 months, I turned my back on God's calling to become a minister,were the top ones!     Yet even through that, I will NOT fall away from my Lord again! I have no intention of living that kind of life!    That's what it's all about, my beloved Brothers & Sister in Christ-humbling ourselves to an Almighty God-admitting to Him that we cannot do ANYTHING without His help! I'm have as much as possible faith that the Lord WILL provide for my needs, as He has done so |`|MOAUb45Jaa	Yes, God can intervene in any situation.|`|K66gAJkyaa	ABSOLUTELY!!! :D    I thank God that you believe in miracles! It's sad that some people don't...    My friend from school was driving to work one day in the hard-blowing-snow, Colorado wintery weather. With the roads all covered with snow/ice and difficult driving (slow driving), this other car sped by really fast and somehow made 3 cars slide off to the side/ditch in order not to get hit. One of the cars was my friend.     Well, in the ditch now, she got stuck and the car wouldn't get out. She was by herself and couldn't push the car I guess. She couldn't do anything to get to work or even home.     So she just prayed.    I think she said within like minutes, some guy(s) came by and ASKED HER IF SHE NEEDED HELP! They pulled her out and even took her home (she never did get to work that night!)    She was so very thankful to God and to the guys for rescuing her! She also told me that she told the guy(s) she would pray for them (maybe they are Christians, or maybe they will accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior because of this situation!)    THAT was a miracle!! Praise God that He comes through when we need Him to! KEEP PRAYING!    Oh and there's also a story I read. I goes something like this.     On an extremely hot and non-breezy day, a mom and little daughter went to the store to buy a card. Coming out of the store onto the sidewalk, the Mom was really interested in the card she bought, not even looking up when crossing the street, holding her daughter's hand.    Suddenly, while they were crossing (and not paying attention) some big bus or truck or something came rushing towards them. They would have probably been killed if not for God's intervention. Suddenly, out of nowhere on this extremely hot day, wind blew from nowhere and blew the card right out of the mom's hand. She went chasing it back to the sidewalk, the truck/bus speeding by, never knowing they just escaped death because of a wind that appeared "out of nowhere".    She never knew they could have died that day. God just saved them like he does for each of us, providing "little" miracles maybe even everyday without us even knowing it!    Hope this encourages you!     God bless and KEEP PRAYING! Tell God what's on your heart and how you feel, He sure is listening and want you to talk to Him!

1KKmYDfyaa	 strano che non si includano questi tasti...    Siccome il layout della tastiera italiana non include queste lettere, non si possono scrivere senza cambiare/editare il layout.  Ad esempio, io usava il layout per le tastiere americane, le quali non includono neanche una lettera con accento.  Ma quando ho incominciato i miei studi della lingua italiana avevo bisogno degli accenti.  Quindi, ho cambiato il mio layout a "United States-International."  In questo layout, ci sono alcuni tasti che funzionano come "tasti morti."  Ad esempio, dopo di premere il tasto per l'apostrofo la tastiera non scrive niente; la tastiera (tecnicamente Windows) aspetta che io prema il prossimo tasto.  Se io scrivo una vocale, Windows la scriver con un accento acuto .  Si pu cambiare il layout della tastiera nel pannello di controllo, c' una opzione che dice "Opzioni internazionali..."    Pero credo che questo layout possa essere utile solo nel caso di una tastiera americana perch i nostri tasti si trovano in posti diversi dei vostri.    Alcune soluzioni:  --Se usi Firefox, si pu scaricare un componente aggiuntivo (add-on) che si chiama "abcTajpu" con cui si possono scegliere tutte le lettere con tutti gli accenti da un men.  https://addons.mozilla.org/it/firefox/ad...    --Come ha detto Cosimo, si pu usare Microsoft Word.    --Una soluzione estrema:  C' un programma che si chiama "Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator" con cui si pu creare un layout basato su quello italiano che avr i tasti per le letter  e .  Ad esempio, si pu programmare che quando si preme il tasto > con il tasto > (o forse >) scriver >.   L'ho e l'ho usato.  Si pu scaricarlo qui:  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/detai...    L'ultima opzione sarebbe quella pi conveniente, ma siccome il programma  tutto in inglese ed  fatto per persone che conoscono i computer bene (come io), pu essere un po' difficile.  Se vuoi, sarei in grado di fare un layout editato che puoi provare nel tuo computer.  Se ti interessi di provarlo, mandami un'e-mail.    Spero di essere utile.  Mi dispiace se non ho spiegato qualcosa bene, sono ancora uno studente della lingua italiana.|`|XXQhBlYlaa	ehehehh  le lettere maiuscole in italiano si possono accentare???( non credo )  ps : se non avessi il tastierino numerico ?? :)|`|FJAQvjvcaa	A me interessa!!!

HAT  Well,measure the dogs head and sew some elastic together about a centimetre smaller than the dogs actual head.this should make it not fall of.try to decorate it in a halloween way!My idea would be make an orange director hat and for the top part that sticks out make it green,which would be like a pumpkin.                                              ACCESSORIES  well,try and buy a trick or treating bag that is small.put a few doggie treats in and loop it over the dogs neck.(but make sure the bag isnt heavy or it could hurt the dogs neck)                          Hope I helped you out with the choice!

Mullahs want you to wear hijab so no God will not punish you if you accept him as Lord. Islam is not from God.    Why Mohammed was not a prophet:    One who claims to be a messenger of God is expected to live a saintly life. He must not be given to lust, he must not be a sexual pervert, and he must not be a rapist, a highway robber, a war criminal, a mass murderer or an assassin. One who claims to be a messenger of God must have a superior character. He must stand above the vices of the people of his time. Yet Muhammads life is that of a gangster godfather. He raided merchant caravans, looted innocent people, massacred entire male populations and enslaved the women and children. He raped the women captured in war after killing their husbands and told his followers that it is okay to have sex with their captives and their right hand possessions (Quran 33:50) He assassinated those who criticized him and executed them when he came to power and became de facto despot of Arabia. Muhammad was bereft of human compassion. He was an obsessed man with his dreams of grandiosity and could not forgive those who stood in his way. Muhammad was a narcissist like Hitler, Saddam or Stalin. He was astute and knew how to manipulate people, but his emotional intelligence was less evolved than that of a 6-year-old child. He simply could not feel the pain of others. He brutally massacred thousands of innocent people and pillaged their wealth. His ambitions were big and as a narcissist he honestly believed he is entitled to do as he pleased and commit all sorts of crimes and his evil deeds are justified.    Why Quran is not from God:    Muhammad produced no miracles and when pressed he claimed that his miracle is the Quran. Yet a cursory look at the Quran reveals that this book is full of errors. Quran is replete with scientific heresies, historic blunders, mathematical mistakes, logical absurdities, grammatical errors and ethical fallacies. It is badly compiled and it contradicts itself. There is nothing intelligent in this book let alone miraculous. Muhammad challenged people to produce a Surah like it or find an error therein, yet Muslims would kill anyone who dares to criticize it. In such a climate of hypocrisy and violence truth is the first casualty.|`|IxoBFCpTaa	The Qur'an does not say that there will be a punishment for not wearing hijab. There is still debate as to whether or not the Qur'an says to wear hijab.        Don't you as a Christian believe the same thing will happen to us? That seems kind of hypocritical of you.  ==========================  It doesn't necessarily have to be torture, this is just one verse:  http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...

That will be better, so that they may be recognised and not annoyed. Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. (Quran 33:59)    And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what must ordinarily appear therof; that they should draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, or their brothers' sons or their sisters' sons, or their women or the servants whom their right hands possess, or male servants free of physical needs, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex, and that they should not strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments. And O you Believers, turn you all together towards Allah, that you may attain Bliss. (Quran 24:31).    O you Children of Adam! We have bestowed on you raiment to cover your shame as well as to be an adornment to you. But the raiment of righteousness, that is the best. Such are among the Signs of Allah, that they may receive admonition. (Quran 7:26)    it doesn't matter what punishment you get, we all know that the punishment is going to be BAD. what Allah had commanded we must just do it to attain the reward and be successful in the hereafter.|`|UpIjgNV5aa	Why would there be ANY punishment?

Affluent Middle eastern women used to go outside almost bare breasted and thin clothes. they were asked to cover those with the clothing they had on their head. from that people thought that it is compulsory to wear hijab....but its not. what is important is to dress up modestly. look for the word hijab in quran. you are not going to find it.|`|OwA4CCFvaa	"Sins are divided into two categories, minor and major. Minor sins may be expiated for by prayer, fasting and righteous deeds. Major sins (which are those concerning which a specific warning has been narrated, or for which there is a specific hadd punishment in this world or torment in the Hereafter) cannot be expiated for by righteous deeds. Rather the one who commits such sins has to repent sincerely from them. Whoever repents, Allaah will accept his repentance. There are many kinds of major sins such as lying, zinaa, riba (usury/interest), stealing, not wearing hijaab at all, and so on.       Based on the above, we cannot say for certain whether a woman who does not wear hijaab will enter Hell, but she deserves the punishment of Allaah because she has disobeyed His command to her.  With regard to her specific fate, Allaah knows best what it will be. We cannot speak about things of which we have no knowledge, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):     And follow not (O man, i.e., say not, or do not, or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart of each of those ones will be questioned (by Allaah) [al-Israa 17:36]      It is sufficient deterrent for the Muslim whose heart is aware to know that if he does a certain action he will be exposed to the punishment of his Lord, because His punishment is severe and painful, and His Fire is hot indeed.       The Fire of Allaah, kindled,     Which leaps up over the hearts [al-Humazah 104:6-7]       On the other hand, for the woman who obeys her Lords commands  including observing complete hijaab  we hope that she will enter Paradise and attain the victory of salvation from the Fire and its torments."    Islam Q&A   Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	its between her and her Lord, any force applied is going to cause massive ignorance and confusion... as you can see! Is it the Hijab I look at or their butts?|`|X5gmVvMDaa	It may not say what the punishment is but Allah ask us to do something and you doing if you disobey Allah, then he is most severe in Punishment if u don't follow his order and Allah is also most forgiving so why challenge what is being said and just follow what Allah ask us is it worth the punishment in the hear after?      And follow not (O man, i.e., say not, or do not, or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart of each of those ones will be questioned (by Allaah) [al-Israa 17:36]    It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision [al-Ahzaab 33:36]         And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbands fathers, or their sons, or their husbands sons, or their brothers or their brothers sons, or their sisters sons, or their (Muslim) women (i.e. their sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess, or old male servants who lack vigour, or small children who have no sense of feminine sex. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And all of you beg Allaah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful    [al-Noor 24:31]     2  Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):     And as for women past childbearing who do not expect wedlock, it is no sin on them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment. But to refrain (i.e. not to discard their outer clothing) is better for them. And Allaah is All?Hearer, All?Knower    [al-Noor 24:60]       read this I hope that this helps    http://islamqa.com/en/ref/7436/not%20wea...    http://islamqa.com/en/ref/13998/hijab|`|CQz8dMzFaa	There are no verses. That alone should be proof that the hijab is not the law. A law always has sentences.    24:30 'Tell the believing men to lower their gaze, and guard their  modesty..'  Allah expects us to be Islamic and follow the laws of the Quran. Considering that men do follow the above rule, why would women need to wear hijabs? Nevertheless, Allah is smarter than mortals and knows modesty is required to beware the straying eye, and so has told us to cover our private parts. Hair isn't what attracts a man to a woman, they NEVER notice new haircuts (ask any worldly girl and see if she denies that)!     The headscarf is merely a traditional thing, not Islamic, and a girl is not improper if she doesn't have one on. It is a Jewish and Christian tradition that has been carried down by Muslims.   It is in the Bible:  1Cor 11:5  but any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head-it is the same as if her head were shaven.11:6 For if a woman will not veil herself, then she should cut off her hair; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her wear a veil. 11:10 That is why a woman ought to have a veil on her head, because of the angels. 11:13 Judge for yourselves; is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?

And I was just married to a former white swim suit model, who I basically had to beat white men off her with a stick when I turned my back. Part two is that "white men gets the best of black women". That one I can't say that I've ever seen a white guy with a black woman, (here anyway) that wasn't fine... hum  foot note: turned out the former swim suit model is now a former wife, pathological liar,( Who would make Casey Anthony seem normal).

I feel I have to stand up for Asian males who get snubbed by Asian females here. Asian females are 4x as likely to marry a Caucasion than an Asian male. As of 2006 yes it is true the vast majority of "Asians" (stupid term since it encompasses so many ethnic groups) do marry inside their race.  There were 2,493,000 Asian married couples. But there WERE 530,000 Asian female-White male couples. By far the biggest interracial marriage coupling.     Instead of being angry at people for talking about how much Asian women like White men, maybe you should be angry at all these Asian women chasing after White men and perpetuating the stereotype. Just a thought. The Asian women may not be gold diggers, but something is rotten in Denmark.    With that being said, the worst stereotype about black women is that we all wear weave or relax our hair. But I have to admit there is basis there.

When I see people like this I pity them, but I do not react to them, otherwise I would just be feeding into it.|`|4f53edbce16f4673f58a9dcccc9dfddfaa	I myself am goth, and I'd say it's because of what so-called goths, or mallgoths, do.  These kids aren't really goth, but since they seem to be the most visible and apparent, the mainstream gets the impression that baggy pants and chains and listening to crappy metal are goth when none of those things are.  So the mainstream thinks it's something that kids who are simply crying out for attention and are trying to be weird do, when in reality it's simply a music subculture based off of punk and post-punk that started to emerge in the late '70s and early '80s.  So it's absolutely not what most people think and when they see someone like me who wears primarily black, they think I'm the same as mallgoths and I'm some loser looking for attention, when really I'm just attracted to the aesthetic of the goth subculture (the real aesthetic, not that mallgoth crap) and I happen to like goth music (real goth music like Bauhaus, not metal or emo or any of that).  It just happens to be a specific interest in a certain type of music and fashion, so really people shouldn't think it's bad, but they do because they get the wrong impression.

Hope I helped.|`|ZJ6Nwbv3aa	Chief says, you are pushing too hard that is to be easy, which you make hard.    Everything has limits on you so back off a bit and take it easy.

Whoever memorizes Quraan and acts upon it, Allaah will reward him and honour him greatly for that, so that he will rise in status in Paradise to a level commensurate with what he memorized of the Book of Allaah.    Al-Tirmidhi (2914) and Abu Dawood (1464) narrated from Abd-Allaah ibn Amr that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: It will be said to the companion of the Quraan: Recite and rise in status, recite as you used to recite in the world, for your status will be at the last verse that you recite. This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 5/218, no. 2240, after which he said:     Note that what is meant by the companion of the Quraan is the one who memorizes it by heart, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, The one who knows more Quraan should lead the people in prayer, meaning the one who has memorized the most.  The differentiation in status in Paradise will depend on how much was memorized in this world, not how much one will recite on that day as some people imagine. This clearly points to the virtue of the hafiz who has memorized the Quraan, but that is subject to the condition that he memorizes it for the sake of Allaah, not for worldly purposes or financial gain. Otherwise the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Most of the hypocrites of my ummah are among those who have memorized Quraan.     Concerning the virtue of the hafiz who memorizes the Quraan, al-Bukhaari (4937) narrated from Aaishah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The likeness of the one who reads Quraan and memorizes it is that he is with the righteous honourable scribes. The likeness of the one who reads it and tries hard to memorize it even though it is difficult for him, he will have two rewards.     For the hafiz who has memorized the Quraan, praying qiyaam al-layl is easy. And the Quraan will intercede for him on the Day of Resurrection, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Fasting and the Quraan will intercede for a person on the Day of Resurrection. Fasting will say, O Lord, I deprived him of food and desires during the day, so let me intercede for him. The Quraan will say, O Lord I deprived him of his sleep at night, so let me intercede for him. Then they will both intercede for him. Narrated by Ahmad, al-Tabaraani and al-Haakim; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami, no. 3882     And Allaah knows best.     It should be noted here that there is a weak (daeef) hadeeth that is quoted concerning the virtue of memorizing Quraan. This hadeeth says, The bearer of the Quraan, if he regards what it permits as halaal and what it forbids as haraam, he will intercede for ten of his family members on the Day of Resurrection, all of whom deserved to enter Hell. This was narrated by al-Bayhaqi in Shuab al-Eemaan (The Branches of Faith) from Jaabir; it was classed as daeef by al-Albaani in Daeef al-Jaami.      Islam Q&A        i know u may be tired but good things dont come easily, ppl sometimes get tired a lot for having the reward..and its a big reward.  u know i tried for days to participate in meetings where they learn quour'aan but it didnt work...so thats frustated....  yalla be strong, ALLAH love the strong mu'men So dont leave threward sister, ALLAH love u for giving the cahnce to have ths reward so plzzz dont loose it.

We have something called, "Free choice." The difference is that what Allah "Wills" always happens and what we choose may or may not happen. We are not being judged on the outcome of things, we are being judged on our choices. This means that at the core of everything will always be our intentions. Whatever we intended, is what we will have the reward for. Each person will be judged according to what Allah gave them to work with, how they used it and what they intended to do with it.    As regards the actual "Judgment Day" - Allah tells us that everything we are doing is being recorded and not a single tiny thing escapes from this record. Even an atom's weight of good will be seen on the Day of Judgment and even a single atom's weight of evil will be seen too.     On That Day (of judgment) mankind will proceed in scattered groups and they will be shown their deeds.   So whoever does good equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it.   And whoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it. [Noble Quran 99:6-8]     The one who will bring the evidences against us will be ourselves. Our ears, tongue, eyes and all of our bodies will begin to testify against us in front of Allah on the Day of Judgment. None will be oppressed on that Day, none will be falsely accused.    He could have put everyone in their respective places from the very beginning, but the people would complain as to why they were thrown in Hell without being given a chance. This life is exactly that; a chance to prove to ourselves who we really are and what we would really do if we indeed had a free choice.    Allah Knows everything that will happen, but we don't. That is why the test is fair.|`|GcOWoAmSaa	Allah, why did you pretend to be God?|`|FhXzlnDOaa	Why does he pretend to be God?|`|Jvsc2lQkaa	I think I would ask him what kind of a sick, twisted freak would deliberately cause me to not be able to see the "truth", and then punish me with an eternity of torture for not seeing the "truth".      I'm sure this will earn me an additional torture, since psychotic megalomaniacs don't like their inconsistencies to be revealed.    Fortunately, Allah is a figment of Muhammad's fevered, schizophrenic mental illness, so I'm cool.|`|VSpqYAabaa	" Is the star and crescent a carry-over from the lunar worshiping days?"

"If this being is omnipotent, then every occurrence, including every human action, every human thought, and every human feeling and aspiration is also His work; how is it possible to think of holding men responsible for their deeds and thoughts before such an almighty Being? In giving out punishment and rewards He would to a certain extent be passing judgment on Himself. How can this be combined with the goodness and righteousness ascribed to Him?" -- Albert Einstein    "I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves. Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death; let feeble souls, from fear or absurd egoism, cherish such thoughts. I am satisfied with the mystery of the eternity of life and with the awareness and a glimpse of the marvelous structure of the existing world, together with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion, be it ever so tiny, of the Reason that manifests itself in nature." -- Albert Einstein|`|1d40jvLnaa	Darkins?  Who is Darkins?|`|1MGXHYq9aa	I guess it would depend on how good their science theories were. Believing in God has nothing to do with science.     God made the watch.

oYVxMmbQaa	Dude, my grandma's 88 years old and she's still wary of how White people will treat her whenever she goes into town.

Those are wounds that can't be healed.|`|oil8ALh4aa	Something in the past of messed her up, and im not saying it was segregation, im saying anything could have done that.

If I were you I would probably like knock at her house and ask her gently if there's something wrong. And you feel sorry or something.

She's old..seriously!|`|jdKTs3aHaa	i don't blame her for being scared of you.|`|ncdTxID9aa	She's probably cautious people do rob the elderly. Leave her alone don't antagonize her that's immature.

pTaf7PtTaa	You're not being impolite. Because, you see, there is always going to be a noisy classroom where everybody disrespects the teachers and cant shut up. If anything, your CLASSMATES are being impolite in not  considering the teacher's rules and for being loud when her throat hurts like that. You have every right to ask them to be quiet, even in a loud voice. I can't think of a better way to knock some sense into those disrespectful kids.|`|iksF9tQAaa	No, I don't think it is.

If the others will listen to you without your having to raise your voice, you wouldn't need the teacher's permission.  If you are going to get everyone's attention on you instead of the teacher, even briefly, to be truly polite about it you should have that permission from the person who should be in charge.    If it only happened this once, I don't think your teacher would have a problem with it.  Truly.|`|UBypaQtFaa	It wasn't your place to demand that your classmates be quiet.  I think your heart was in the right place in trying to help your teacher but you should not have done that.      OK so you asked a question and when someone disagrees with you , you basically say you don't want answers that disagree with what you did.  I'll just bet you don't have many friends.|`|AA11703652	I would have done exactly the same thing...although I am aware that it might make me look like a suck-up.

After everything is said and done, he'll just look at it as another Myspace add that probably won't go past "Hey tnx 4 the add!" on his comments list (which means you have the perfect opportunity to learn about him and befriend him in a subtle matter)    You have the golden ticket man!

MhfneF0xaa	I know this hurts. I wish I had any words of wisdom but I don't think anything I could say right now would help, other than "I'm sorry that happened to you."    And I am truly sorry that happened to you.    Just know that there are others who care about your feelings, and can understand. You certainly came to the right place.    You weren't betrayed, there was no commitment on his part, so he really didn't dump you. Things just didn't work out, and I'm really sorry for you that they didn't.    You're not dumb, you're not stupid, you're not ugly, you're not horrible. You're a human being, with feelings.    Be yourself, be a loving and caring human being, and don't blame anyone for this situation. I know you don't want to believe it right now, but it will pass, because it must.    I don't know if this will help much right now, but I wish it would.    Do you have anyone you can talk to about this? You can email me or IM me if you need someone to talk to.    You may not believe it, but I understand.|`|FYFyQVZfaa	Maybe he just didn't like you the way you liked him, and he didn't want to hurt you in the long run.  It will be okay, I know it burns now, but everything will be fine.  Anyway, if he can't see how amazing you are, he's not worth it anyway.|`|Gj9IQaJuaa	um forget about him!|`|IMHwA20jaa	Don't think so highly of yourself, and he's probably the sweet type. By how you approached him, some of his fears may have come out about him being gay. You should try being kind and considerate to him, and if you do really like him then having him as a friend and knowing that he's happy should be enough :)|`|Ut9Y1xUoaa	Get over it.

JgU9vaP4aa	My daughter is a chearleader..........her outfit was adjusted to wear pants under the skirt.  and long sleves. she is 13 and Im still working on her wearing a hajab.......... LOL inshallah one day soon she will agree.|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	Your not serious right? OK just on the of chance you are.    1. Its haram for YOU to have a GF. So if you are so worried about what is the correct thing in Islam start with self.  2. Of course Cheer leading is Haram.   3. A short skirt and a Hijab? Come on now you cannot be serious? That's no compromise. You cannot show off one part of your body and cover another and think that is wearing a Hijab. Hijab is not just about covering hair.  4. She is free to do what she wants but if she is a Muslim and cares about submitting to the will of Allah it should not even be a question for her or a consideration.|`|AYs6iFlLaa	There are clothes that she can wear that will cover her. The schools here allow girls to participate in cheer leading wearing long pant suits under the skirts and their hijabs. She should ask her coach about alternative clothing. you're not wrong for telling the truth. Are the guys going to be looking at her hair or her BUTT?|`|efb24eedcf484b875157731a08fef57aaa	What difference would it make for her to be on the cheerleading team, if she has a boyfriend? Did you know that dating is haram?    If you want to do the right thing, break up with her, and ask for forgiveness.|`|0zDVYP2vaa	Umm its haram to have a girlfriend. Does the word hypocrite ring a bell?|`|LVe6MJfMaa	Let her do what she wants. Humans were born naked so I don't really see any problem with showing skin. either way most cheerleading skirts aren't that short, plus you have to wear bloomers under them which are basically like shorts.. and how the heck do you expect her to cheerlead with a hijab?|`|Jvsc2lQkaa	My aren't you wound really tight!      It's sad that your slavish, restrictive religion has made you so intolerant.      God made women, and he made them beautiful.  Men are to appreciate the beauty of a woman, not hide her under a burkha. If God didn't want men gawking at women, he would have made them ugly (Although from what I've seen under some of those burkhas, the burkha may be a blessing in disguise!  YEECH!)!    If I was your girlfriend, you'd be history.|`|xxwb0sCdaa	I would let my GF...If I had one, does this have to do with your culture?  I think you should do whats left.|`|6LBJgACSaa	Having a girlfriend is haram....    I'm not going to force my beliefs on you but if you're so concerned about what is haram and what is halal, then If I were you I'd rethink what I was doing.|`|tbwfSPI7aa	Well if she really likes her boyfriend it shouldn't matter about what other guys do.|`|qPSkkPqwaa	Yes you did the right thing.   I am guessing she isnt religious because if she were then she wouldnt join it or consider joining.     No it cant be that shes wearing hijab and skirts.    http://quran-hadith-studies.suite101.com...|`|IEaedB5Eaa	Why are you dating in the first place? You need to live her and stay good muslim yourself. She's going to be bad influence on you.|`|q9C46Wuqaa	You Hippocrate   It's okay for you to choose to have a girlfriend - but not okay for her to choose to be a cheerleader? Think twice brother.  Let her decide.|`|LAt9HqC5aa	Ah, the double standard.    So it's absolutely fine to have a girlfriend, but not fine that your she wants to be a cheerleader?    It does not matter whether she wears the hijab or not, one of the guys gawking at her is you so there's no difference.    If you truly love Allah (swt) you would do better to break up with her because she is not your mahram so it is unlawful for the two of you to be touching/kissing/whatnot.|`|7fc862488fd8bbc01863aaa40926effdaa	Dump her.|`|Xosu35K7aa	guys are always going too look at your girlfriend. theres no way you can stop that. if you trust your girlfriend there should be no problem with that.  technically you cant stop her. but she will listen too you. & as her bf try make her happy & support her decision :]|`|zKQKl9mZaa	Are you a troll?|`|IRNqpOmSaa	Let her do whatever she wants.|`|TNxXBSvmaa	How could you keep your girlfriend from doing something new, that she wanted to do, and be so selfish?  She should definately be on the squad! If you're going to be so shallow then she shouldm't care about your opinion.  You should try understanding for her point of view. You shouldn't have the right to make her decisions. That's one thing she definately has the right to do. Let her live her life and try different things and be a teenager. Who cares if boys are looking at her, she'll like the attention, but if she really loves you then she will stay with you, but if she doesn't then she might have to find a new man, sounds like she might be looking for one soon with the attitude you have.      By the way it's a cheer "squad" not a "team".    Hope you will think about that a little more and try not to be so negative.|`|GM0kOZpRaa	Don't feel bad about yourself too much, if she wants to join, then try to get her to wear pants or something, like you know, because I think I know some muslim cheerleaders that do dress some what modest still.    And those people that say dating is haram on this Ramadan section, well only some Muslims believe in dating and some don't, so if your parents are ok with it, then I would say don't cross limmits.     dude if she doesn't want to wear hijab then try to at least get her to tie her hair back or something.|`|rdoPeWnzaa	Yes you did your job. I used to be on the cheerleading team when I wasn't religious, and what's worse is that they had to make me my own skirt b/c im really skinny and stuff. It's fun, but in the end that's not what matters. In judgement day she will regret it. Life is only a test. And now I realized this and Alhamdulillah pray five times a day read the quaran, well aware of everything. I changed for the better thank god. In the end cheerleading isn''t going to benifit me.|`|j5gEUywjaa	1st of all u shouldn't even be dating...and wear a lil skirt and hijab at the same time?? your kidding right? then what's the point of covering your hair if your legs are going to be showing? if she really cares about her religion and loves Allah then she wouldn't even think about doing this

I collect Old time radio, so I get to hear many of Colona and Hope's best.|`|LQ52bOFFaa	I was never a big fan of his, but I admired him for going with Bob Hope year, after year to entertain our troops.  If they were alive today they would be in Iraq and Afghanistan every Christmas.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I believe he spelled his first name with a "J". I remember him from the  early days of black and white TV. He also toured with Bob Hope with  his overseas shows, along with the Andrews Sisters, and other acts  and singers. I enjoyed the link you provided. I'd forgotten how loud  Cologna was on stage. Give me Dean Martin anyday, but not Jerry.  LOL. I am not for his buggy eyes either, come to think of it. I enjoyed  the Hope and Crosby snips and the Andrews sisters with Dean. TV  has sure changed since those early days of musical entertainment.  Especially the fact, that in those days, we understood what the  singer was saying in his lyrics. And the women didn't ordinarily hit  the high notes and kept them going up and down, like some today  we hear trying out on American Idol. And those are the better ones.  Gramaphones were already replaced by phonographs when I was  a child. I have only seen the gramaphone in some museums. And  then, you aren't allowed to touch them.     Thanks for the link, that provided alot of memories of those golden  days of television.|`|1NO10YfPaa	Very much so.

bpsIfvyCaa	Depends on the person saying and whether it is merited in the first place|`|UmMxmmRMaa	Nope. I know me better than anybody else does, so it really only matters what I think of me.

Only care about|`|a3j82sBpaa	If the person is someone I care, yes. If the person is honest and trustworthy, knowing his opinion will make me a better person.|`|ugIf5TJKaa	of course. I wouldn't be a normal human being if I didn't. I'm not going to sit and dwell hours and hours over what people think of me but I'm also not going to be completely ignorant.     Also, I like to be appreciated and loves, To feel unique and special. I think that goes for most people.|`|gYegDDuBaa	no. i'll let them think what they want to think whether it's true or not.|`|MuQA3CKdaa	It depends on what part of myself they say about me.   When it's about clothes, I care no matter how much I don't want to. Why?     One Word--  SOCIETY.    Everywhere I look when I go to school, girls are wearing Aeropastle [I don't know how to spell it], Hollister, Fitch, etc etc. Those who wear skinny jeans, fitting shirts, Vans, ballet shoes, EVERYTHING.   They are wearing brand name clothes that cost bunch of money to me while I wear clothes I got from a tiny outfit stores named, "Fashion America" or "$4.99 & Up Clothing Store" that I find to be very comfortable in. I stand out when it comes to Fashion Envy.     Once, I wore skinny jeans that were long and ended up really baggy at the ankles. At recess, I heard a girl in my class asking someone why I was wearing that and what the hell I was thinking.     I really don't WANT to care, but stupid society just makes the thoughts of random people stick to my mind and makes me want to follow the crowd who are spoiled and have enough money to buy $60 skinny jeans with holes in them and that makes their feet look ENORMOUS!
FvoxgjbJaa	Not only are bears murderers but the male polar bears practice infanticide by eating their own cubs. They can also be considered "deadbeat" papa bears, since they leave the raising and providing for of bear cubs up to mama bear.|`|UyDkYaXuaa	No. And look I'm not going to deny that meat is also part of the human food chain, my choice is my choice. Plus the human body adapts to different diets.     The only reason I do not eat meat is because of the cruelty that goes on in slaughterhouses as well as the health risks with meat. Those animals die slowly and painfully. I do not want to support such cruelty.|`|8fp5dSW4aa	No idiot. Bears eat meat to survive, and they will remain where the are in the food chain.

If I was a bear I'd eat meat because that is how I was raised, there is no alternative.  Humans can easily trade in a hamburger for a salad.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Most would not hold less intelligent animals to as high of a standard.    And do not confuse vegans with PETA and other crazy animal rights activists. Some vegans choose it for other reasons.    PETA on the other hand is just completely out there and never will see reason. They don't believe in an use of animals, even as guide dogs or if it could cure a disease. They have even supported terrorist groups.

I think there has to be something in the rumours surrounding Princess Diana's death - this is compounded by the fact that there are no statues etc., to her anywhere, apart from one ghastly clogged up mini stream, and they are trying so hard to air brush her out existence.

If they want to behave badly then they have to get used to being treated without respect, if they want to be respected..and useful to the country, then they have to stop believing their hangers on when  they are told it is alright to behave the way they do. There seems to be some idea in the royal circle that all they need is the "common touch" whatever that may be, to make themselves popular again but the truth is that the common people would mostly be ashamed of relatives or friends who behaved the way the royals do. Even Madonna and Ritchie felt the need to conduct the breakdown of their marriage with some semblance of dignity and concern for the children; such a pity that the house of Windsor is inclined believe that if a royal behaves in a certain way, it becomes royal behaviour instead of the vulgarity it would remain with anyone else.|`|RNXhqBgiaa	they always attractive in some way  rich and have a lot of free time that should do something more useful  Diana was the one who behaved proper good royal family  but she make the rest look cold and useless  and look more stupid when they not accept her as role model of royal family    in Thailand royal family are more respected   because the king behav very good role model  sacrified and sincerely love his people  the rest royal family are at least try to follow his steps  for the junk springs they keep they bad behav shut in hole.  and paparazzi respects them, not make any bad news    doesnt like here that people try to dig up the royal family bahav|`|e3a13ee6ed28dd6f6ac586714ca49fadaa	scroungers ,  every last one of them......................|`|twdXT5wOaa	I supose their silly games are helpful to the multimillionaires' media, in that they keep the plebs' minds off the fact that they are being robbed, deluded and exploited by said multimillionaires.

You only get this on message boards/forums and this isn't a message board this is an Question/Answer website.    I love Yahoo Answers and I would love to party with you!    *Just don't let Britney in the party.  :)|`|0KR4wyoQaa	Yeah, that'd be so cool.

Yes, I would attempt to contact them. Malevolent? No.  I would have many questions about specific subjects,in which I would like to see some of the history/origin of.

EYqTV2EYaa	First name.  City and State.  Address.|`|AA10950898	You didn't mention any other details like why you think you are being stalked.  I think it would probably start with someone following you, not necessarily knowing anything about you, just liking the way you look.  I don't know, I'm not a stalker. Tell the Police and the people nearest you for your own safety if you are worried at all.|`|Q6vk0LLZaa	if sum1 had ur IP adress, name, or ur comon username on website, then ne1 cud stalk u.     --E.D|`|gYegDDuBaa	everything about you pretty much.
vg3ih0foaa	If you think that it's possible he could know or suspect then i would say he knows about your bi-ness. If theres little or no way he could know he probably just thought you were going out for a party or something since you weren't coming home, and gave you a condom just in case things got frisky with a girl.|`|qDbbw3CTaa	Nothing to worry about. I am almost sure 80% of parents do this. He is just looking out for you, that's all. Be grateful that he cares|`|anuhf4nSaa	he could heard you talking to him     idk|`|i2QUf6JMaa	wow dude seems likes he definitely knows and is okay with it but you should ask him why he gave you the condom anyway|`|0YDLQjbtaa	no i dont hink he knows your bi.  i think he thought you were lieing and that you were goin with a girl and stayin over at hers|`|N73oZyY8aa	Be thankful that your Dad is so cool.

As my dad used to say: "be good and if you can't be good, be careful."|`|0LKIsD7Oaa	well, its like a fathers rule, they have to tell their kids to be safe. and hes right, be safe. better have and not need than need and not have.|`|Dkylapi6aa	you are lucky! go make love now.

SCkhQc2Caa	now Raafidis claim that they are Ahl Sunnah ...lol    rofl  _______________|`|Qvc0tVOnaa	Good one!!|`|bpr0ONbAaa	Why are you asking? Is it haram to seek knowledge about other religions/sects in your sect? Because we are ecnouraged to seek knowledge about other beliefs that differ from our beliefs.  I am a shia Alhamdulillah.|`|LmKVepcXaa	This girl I used to work with told me that Shia spend most of their time in their religious gatherings talking about how they need to put an end to the Sunni sect. She said the Sheik screams into the mic and starts swearing at all Sunni's and everyone else chants after him "Ameen" even if he says something like "kill your Sunni neighbors wife if she is pregnant because she is carrying your future enemy". She said these discussions occur the most during Ashoora.|`|IRNqpOmSaa	How about you grow up and stop asking such provocative questions.  Shias are Muslims too.|`|xuZ2y3ADaa	lol not sure as well u noe what im sayin. cool.|`|E0WUtePYaa	Literally every shia in this section has stated in the past that they read and pst sunni ahadith to get their point across.  To not give you guys a chance to accuse the Shia's of 'lying' or 'making up' stuff.  You know what i mean?      Its weird though you still felt the need to post this question.  Wasn't it kind of obvious why Shi'as feel the need to read sunni ahadith?|`|AA12279768	Very little. Most of these kids here just copy paste from Answering Ansar. That's why if you were to test them using the sources they claim to be quoting from, they fail miserably in shame.|`|sE94HgDBaa	I don't know.  I don't think I ever met a Shia in real life.    I asked about hadiths earlier today.  I wanted to know specifically which ones that Shia follow and which ones Sunni follow.|`|hl6lDPvDaa	Shias are the true Ahle Sunnah     you sound like a smart ***    why should we bring hadith from Al Kafi?   so you can say its shia garbage?    atleast we know that you can't say its shia garbage to your sahih hadiths.  or do you consider them garbage ?    __________    How can a person misinterpret hadiths?     If a hadith says that Muawiya made it sunnah to curse Ali(AS)    how the hell do you expect us to misinterpret that or twist that?    are you denying your own hadiths?|`|hfAsEiaZaa	lol .......not sure.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	haha...how many Muslims in general read the hadiths and Qur'an everyday?    I think a lot of people google and copy-paste  0.o  that's what I do..it's more convenient than bringing the books out    :)    Allah(swt) knows best|`|e3PWZYsAaa	let's see.....    if i provide proofs from Shia sources, you would say "oh that's some fabricated Shia hadith, we don't believe in that", and that's probebly the nicests thing you would say....    when we provide sunni hadiths, yet again you said it's a Shia made up thingg, why you say that, i do not know......      but end of day, what ever proofs we bring will not change your minds,  specially yours....  as you are among those in 43:22    "Nay! they say: "We found our fathers following a certain religion, and we do guide ourselves by their footsteps."          EDIT:    actually, thanks for asking this question....  now we can clearly see the differences in sects....    del = a very nice and great example of a "sunni"  na2sa = an example of salafis    you can just clearly see the differences...  and you people wonder why Shias and sunnis want to unite....  ....but wahabis and salaifs are making it hard        @Moonlight    well a girl you used to work with told you wrong....    and am i not surprised to see the asker being pleased with your answer.....  it's funny actually.....  when we provide proofs from their own books, it's a fabricated Shia made up thing.....  but when you say something like that it's gana be  "WOW    Thanks for the info"    i am soooooo shaking my head in disappointment right now.....  since Islam tells us to base our believes on proofs, facts and documents.....  but some people do the EXACT opposite......|`|4PbjKk7Vaa	Rofl     shia's are not like nasabies to fabricate hadith day by day for their benefits     Grow up|`|sDdp3RBpaa	?????|`|wwHWnmgzaa	Bro ! change your question  to  " how much time they spend twisting ,misinterpreting,the sunni hadith,    Bcoz if the would have read hadith they will be guided,    By the way they just jump to shias'site and drag a lot of filth from there|`|MhbEQoJYaa	hahaha lol.       Maybe they're trying to prove a point....of course they copy and paste man. do you think if they already knew the Hadith of by heart they will act like this?|`|cd969f9c7a6bf20748a5b6528e2da246aa	As a Sunni, I don't even spend enough time studying the Qur'an and Sunnah enough, that I should be pasting quotes on Y!A.|`|xTRMSm7yaa	you have a very dry sense of humour|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	May as well read the dictionary, as long as you need it as Reference then fine.

All I can tell you is Agee is not an Egyptian nor Arabic word, lol. Could be Turkish or Greek :P|`|VN30ib8eaa	I dont know, what it is?|`|UZ1WkuSsaa	During the era of the Ottoman Empire, Arabic was the predominant language throughout the Empire. The Turkish language was created during Attaturk's reign. Therefore, "agee", if there is such a word, would have to be Arabic. As for your story, I've never heard such a thing.|`|qTf24m2jaa	ewwww......ure gay.        OMG!

KBBonf97aa	It's very normal and common for girls to have attractions to other girls during their adolescent years, but those feelings usually pass.  They have more to do with the intense bonds they form with friends and hormones than what will ultimately become their sexual orientation.    Television and movies have made it fashionable for kids (girls, mostly) to label themselves bisexual, which has further confused kids.  But if you go to you 10-year class reunion, virtually all of the kids who declared themselves bisexual in middle and high school will be happily heterosexual (10% will be gay, statistically).  The "hipness quotient" of bisexuality makes life harder for kids who are struggling to accept their genuine homosexuality.  For them, sexual orientation isn't an accessory they can wear for a while and then discard when it's no longer in style.  Very often, they're used and tossed aside by straight kids who are curious and want to test their own boundaries.    Don't stick yourself with a label, since the odds are huge it won't apply to you in a few years.  And it's a lot easier getting out of the closet than crawling back in when your genuine orientation becomes clear.  I have a friend who declared she was bisexual at 15.  By the time she entered college, she knew she was 100% straight.  More than a decade later, there are still people who won't let her forget that she drew a stupid and very wrong conclusion when she was basically a confused kid.  And she's the first one to admit that she never would have thought she was bisexual unless it was considered cool to do so.    If you've always been interested in guys and the attractions to girls are new, chances are you're 100% straight.  Most girls experience same-sex attractions during adolescence, but those attractions usually end as quickly as they started.  It's just a normal part of growing up that confuses the hell out of people.  A lot of people will tell you to experiment with both guys and girls to see which is more fun, but that generally confuses kids even more.  Sexual orientation has nothing to do with sex acts.  It's an innate part of a person - like eye color or musical talent.  It sorts itself out with no action required on your part.  Just try not to overthink things, since you're supposed to be confused at your age and experimentation won't provide you with clear answers to your questions.  You just have to be a little patient, since sexual orientation always sorts itself out over time.  In a couple years, you'll know exactly who you were supposed to be.|`|IsRbs6Elaa	So you never know, never never know,  Never know enough, 'til it's over love  'Til we lose control, system overload  Screamin' "No! No! No! N-No!"|`|Lkcmgbnraa	curious, until you acutally act on your feelings, i suppose..|`|gXBPLitzaa	It could mean just curious.  But it could me your bi or lesbian it depends.|`|sgRJRuvgaa	It probably means your in a realization phase. I had that same issue once except it was the opposite and now I'm completely gay and I'm sure of it. Maybe you need to do some soul searching|`|3ee9a82552425841f1df0a2f7477f624aa	It would depend on the person.|`|H5CdsnByaa	Curious.|`|vg3ih0foaa	Time will tell.|`|MVAyYCByaa	it means your curious.....  it would only be that u r bi if u do any thing sexual or physical!!!

Problem is, there is none.|`|27104bc8bd5a195c9a918faf29fbd9deaa	I would go to the ER and get a CAT scan to make sure my brain was alrite before i believed what i saw was actully god|`|N4ZQhklSaa	Ive heard atheists call theists hard headed as well, I think both sides are a bit hard headed myself. Not everyone fits into these two extremes anyway. I used to by an atheist, then I had an intense spiritual experience, now I can look back and see the flaws in my former thinking. This of course does not mean I am a fundamentalist Christian, as many atheists on here like to assume that all spiritual people must be brainwashed, delusional or ignorant. I agree that the a literal interpretation of religion is a bad thing,  'god' has shown itself to me. God is not something you just stumble upon, it is something you got to search for. No book or person can give you insight, it has to come from within.|`|qktzCVvMaa	I would convert if God came before me. That's the kind of proof I need. Empirical. Not a banana or a mouse trap or other people's hallucinations.|`|sW6lxVFOaa	It would be crazy not to convert if god has shown himself to us. Keep in mind though, this appearance has to be real, not a mental disorder which is what has happened to all people that have seen god.|`|8ohAAwrEaa	God showed himself repeatedly in the old testament.  Why will he not show himself now?    If he just moves a mountain (he seemed fond of doing this) or made the rivers run with blood or I dunno showed himself on every tv in the world atheists would have no reason to not believe.  But, none of this happens.    Why?  Man created god in his image.|`|oZiQhPzjaa	The only hard proof they have is a biscuit with a face on it.|`|QVFjO5m0aa	You really cant call Atheists hard headed. You are just hard headed if could go back in time and see how everything came into existence and God wasn't there would you believe there is no God. See your both hard headed.|`|UXuGCgo3aa	I think they've had a fair share of negative R&S encounters with atheists.    I am one of the Christians that doesn't view all atheists as such.  I've met numerous atheists (some of my favorite people are), and I must say that I see no reason to generalize.  Like any religion, some have common sense, some are highly intelligent people, and some are nothing less than spiteful.      I'm not focused on converting you - it may be the job of someone here, but certainly not mine.  I accept what you believe, and leave you be, with the exception of the occasional debate.|`|aBHY2iXraa	If God returned and performed miracles, I'd think it was some sort of trick. The harder it is to believe, the more evidence I would require.    Healing the blind with a single touch - Even Benny Hinn can do that!  (Why did God create the blind if they need to be "healed")    Calm hurricanes - They weren't going to last forever anyway  (Why did God create the hurricane if it had to be "calmed")

So I suggest u humbaly make duaa again and ask for forgiveness. Allah answers all duaas in one way or another eventually, just have faith.

d3VV4b6vaa	deceased loved ones are not, and never will be guardian angels. angels are different from humans. deceased loved ones can be spirit guides though, which are similar to guardian angels in the sense they help and huide us daily.  you can meditate and ask your angel for its name (we all have at least two angels with us by the way) ..you might 'hear' it, sense it, an image might come into your mind what its name wil be. whatever sense is your strongest sense, the name will more than likely be heard through that. i.e if you are more vocal, you should be able to hear it, when you ask, or if you're more of a visual person, the name might come to you through images.  the name can be a 'human' name, like Joe, Sara etc.. or it can be a name like 'peace or joy'....so you just have to keep asking to hear their name, and trust that it is what you hear.|`|8k6kxOh2aa	i've never heard this, but i really did see my guardian angel one day, and i know she's a girl. i saw her one night when i was in a hotel room. it was my last day of visiting my uncle in kentucky.   anyways, we were driving home and all of the sudden a big truck turned and was about to hit us. my mom's reflexes were unnaturally fast for a natural humans. i believe my guardian angel helped my mom.  i don't think we're meant to know our guardian angels names though.|`|BvY47ts6aa	For those who believe in angels and guardian angels, there is a way to find out who your guardian angel is.

And u know in Arabic, with the 3 letter roots, its mostly all consonants and now vowels, since there are only 3 vowels in the Arabic alphabet: A (?), O (?) and i (?).

SCkhQc2Caa	Anything may be tolerated, except insults to our beloved Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and slander against his companions and the bearers of his religion.     This implies insults against the Lord of the Worlds, may He be glorified, the One Who praised His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and chose him, and Who praised his companions and chose them and honoured them with the company of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).   __________________________    The view of Ahl al-Sunnah towards the Sahaabah and the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq : http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/13713/    The contrast between the deeds of the Sahaabah and the deeds of the people at the end of time: http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/3374/    The virtue of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them):http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/83121/    Ruling on hating the Sahaabah: http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/45563/    noble Sahaabi Muaawiyah : http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/84304    Our attitude towards Yazeed ibn Muaawiyah: http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/14007/    The Shiah claim that the Sahaabah did not attend the funeral of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/116375/    ____________________________    We love the companions of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and we do not neglect to love any one of them, nor do we disavow any one of them.     We hate those who hate them and who criticize them, and we only mention them in good terms. Loving them is part of religious commitment, faith and ihsaan, and hating them is kufr, hypocrisy and wrongdoing.   ______________________     Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan said:     The way of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah is to love the family (ahl al-bayt) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).     The Naasibis love the Sahaabah but hate the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), hence they were called Naasibis because they set themselves up (nasb) as enemies of the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).     The Raafidis are the opposite: they love the Prophets family (ahl al-bayt)  or so they claim, but they hate the Sahaabah, whom they curse, denounce as kaafirs and criticize.     Whoever hates the Sahaabah hates Islam, because they are the bearers of Islam and the followers of the Chosen Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). So whoever hates them hates Islam, and this indicates that there is no faith in the hearts of such people and that they do not love Islam.     This is an important basic principle which the Muslims should understand, namely loving and respecting the Sahaabah, because that is part of faith. Hating them or hating one of them is kufr and hypocrisy, because loving them is part of loving the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and hating them is part of hating the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).   _________________________|`|hl6lDPvDaa	The Shias divide the companions into three factions:     First, are those who believed in Allah (SWT), believed in the Prophet (PBUH&HF), and gave all they could for the sake of Islam. These are the highest in rank. These companions always supported the Prophet and were with him. They never disobeyed him in any issue, nor did they ever accused him of talking non-sense! (may Allah protect us). These were the companions whose faith in the truthfullness of Rasool (SAW) was of the highest level, whose level of piety was an example for other companions, who died on Haqq. Examples include, but are not limited to, Abu Dhar al-Ghifari, Salman al-Farsi, Miqdad, Amar Ibn Yasir, Jabir Ibn Abdillah al-Ansari etc, may Allah (SWT) be pleased with them.    The second group, are those who were Muslims, but were not sincere in their acts.  These were the ones who did recite the Kalimah, but committed major as well as minor sins.    The third group, are those who became apostate after the death of Prophet as al-Bukhari recorded (see below), or those who neither believed in Allah (SWT), nor the Prophet (PBUH&HF) in the first place, but managed to infiltrate the Islamic isles to be included among the Muslims. These are the hypocrites, like Abu Sufyan, his son Muawiyah etc.      see, the problem is that you guys think all companions were good and you guys put all companion in the first group.     Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, "Some of my companions will come to me at my Lake Fount, and after I recognize them, they will then be taken away from me, whereupon I will say, 'My companions!' Then it will be said, 'You do not know what they innovated (new things) in the religion after you."  Sahih Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 76, Number 584|`|e3PWZYsAaa	Salam,    9:101  "Certain of the desert Arabs round about you are hypocrites, as well as (desert Arabs) among the Medina folk: they are obstinate in hypocrisy: thou knowest them not: We know them: twice shall We punish them: and in addition shall they be sent to a grievous penalty."      The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s) said regarding the martyrs of Uhud:  They are the ones for whom I testify  Abu bakr said: are we not their brothers, O Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s)? We accepted Islam like they did and participated in Jihad like them?  The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s) replied:  Yes! But I do no know what you (will) do after me    Al Muwatta Book 21, Hadith 21.14. Kitabul Jihad          i guess any more hadith from sunnis books would hurt some of my sunni brothers and sisters, and i've been asked by some of my sunni brothers and sisters not to use those hadiths, and i will not use them as long as i don't have to.....    so let this 1 verse of the Holy Quran and 1 hadith from sunni books be a simple answer to this question....    Peace.        EDIT:    in my answer, i'm not trying to say who is and who isn't a companion, or who is good and who is bad......  that's not for me to chose, so lets leave it to the one who should decide that, Allah SWT.    in my answer, all i wanted to say was, just only because some people were close and around prophet Mohammad (PBUH), it doesn't nessecerely mean they were good people, as the Holy Quran says in the verse i've provided, "...thou knowest them not: We know them..."      as you've mentioned in your question, you believe in our thoughts as "wrong" as you've mentioned in your question "...if you do have wrong thoughts...", so it's only logical to bring you proofs and evidences from your books which you look at as "true/right"      Peace.|`|WmU7jhObaa	who the hell is Al muwatta? a "Sunni" source?     back to question i guess Abu Sufyan and Muaywiya    Nobody should judge anyone who was a Companion(RA) and was close to the Prophet(PBUH). calling them Kaffirs out of Ignorance is lame.    if i want to be a prick i would say according to Shia only Ali(RA) Hassan(RA) Hussein(RA) and Fatima(RA) are companions and everybody else was a Kaffir poser.|`|4PbjKk7Vaa	Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those who are with him are strong against the unbelievers, (but) compassionate amongst each other. Thou wilt see them bow and prostrate themselves (in prayer), seeking Grace from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. On their faces are their marks, (being) the traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Taurat (Torah); And their similitude in the Injeel (Gospel) is: Like a seed which sends forth its blade, then makes it strong; it then becomes thick, and it stands on its own stem, (filling) the sowers with wonder and delight. As a result, it fills the Unbelievers with rage at them. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds Forgiveness, and a great Reward." (Holy Qur'an 48:29)        Shia Belief on Sahaba or Ashab-e-Rasool (Companions of Prophet Muhammad (saw)):    Shia do not have a unique opinion towards Sahaba, companions of Prophet Muhammad (saw). Shia divide Sahaba, companions of Prophet Muhammad (saw) into three groups:    The first group, are those who believed in Allah (SWT), believed in Prophet Muhammad (saw), and gave all they could for the sake of Islam. These are the highest in rank. These Sahaba, companions ALWAYS supported Prophet Muhammad (saw) and were WITH him. They never disobeyed him in every other issue, nor did they ever accuse him of talking non-sense! (May Allah protect us). Examples include, but are not limited to, Imam Ali (as), Hazrat Abu Zar Ghaffari (Radhiallahu Anhu), Hazrat Salman al-Farsi (Radhiallahu Anhu), Hazrat Miqdad ibn al-Aswad al-Kindi (Radhiallahu Anhu), Hazrat Ammar Yasir (Radhiallahu Anhu), Hazrat Jabir ibn Abdullah al-Ansari (Radhiallahu Anhu), ... may Allah (SWT) be pleased with them.    The second group, are those who were Muslims, but were not sincere in their acts.    The third group, are those who became apostate after the death of Prophet Muhammad (saw) as al-Bukhari hadith book recorded, or those who neither believed in Allah (SWT), nor Prophet Muhammad (saw) in the first place, but managed to infiltrate the Islamic isles to be included among the Muslims. These are the hypocrites, like Abu Sufyan, his son Muawiyah, and his grandson Yazid.    Yazid, when he became caliph, said: "Hashemite played with the throne, but no revelation was revealed, nor was there a true message!"    "Hashemite" is the clan and tribe of Prophet Muhammad (saw) and this is an intentional pun suggesting that Prophet Muhammad (saw) was a liar, not a true prophet. The "throne (sovereignty)" is an allusion to the control of the affairs of Makkah and the entire region, meaning that the tribe of Hashim controlled the entire region by virtue of the Message of Islam and that Muhammad (saw) is the chosen Prophet, but really there was no revelation and there was no message! That is Yazid's opinion of Allah (SWT), Islam, and Prophet Muhammad (saw). His father, Muawiyah, and his grandfather, Abu Sufyan, were no better. At the beginning the reign of Uthman ibn Affan when Umayyad occupied the prominent positions, Abu Sufayn said:    "O Children of Umayya! Now that this kingdom has come to you, play with it as the children play with a ball, and pass it from one to another in your clan. We are not sure whether there is a paradise or hell, but this kingdom is a reality."    Then Abu Sufyan went to Uhud and kicked at the grave of Hazrat Hamza (the uncle of Prophet Muhammad (saw) who was martyred in the Battle of Uhud in fighting against Abu Sufyan) and said: "O Abu Ya'la! See that the kingdom which you fought against has finally come back to us."    Now let us see what his son, Muawiyah, said when he took over the Caliphate:    "I didn't fight you to pray, fast, and pay charity, but rather to be your leader and control you!"    This is an indication that Muawiyah never cared about any of Islam's mandates, nor Allah's (SWT) orders; rather his war was politically motivated to gain control of the whole region and take over the Caliphate. It is no wonder or surprise! Muawiyah poisoned Imam al-Hasan (as), the greater son of Fatima (sa) - the daughter of Prophet Muhammad (saw).    Then Yazid, the Muawiyah's son, slaughtered Imam al-Hussain (as), in the desert of Karbala in Iraq, and ordered that Imam al-Husain's (as) head be carried on a spear and displayed in towns for people to see it! May Allah avenge Prophet Muhammad's (saw) family!

To be able to walk with my head up high, and to know that wonderful people here at the LGBT section will always be here if I ever needed them, right? :) I love you all.|`|2uUctFHEaa	same here i want to go tanning!!!!!!!!! it's not snowing but there's wind and rain. where oh where has my beautiful summer gone. but i dont like beer, i like fruity drinks lol. i would kill to be on the beach watching the clouds go bye.|`|N73oZyY8aa	Big dykes with small dogs and butches with kittens;  Diesels in tall boots with chains on their mittens;  Femmes in their lipstick with rings in their nose;  These are a few of the gays that I know.

Men in tight dresses with gold lame sashes;  Makeup and high heels and long false eyelashes;  Men who have muscles and men who wear hose;  These are a few of the gays that I know.    When the right wing  Spews its hatred  And it makes me sad,  I simply remember the gays that I know And then I don't  feel - - - so bad.    Doctors and nurses and students and teachers;  Soldiers and singers and actors and preachers;  Lawyers who fight in the courts with our foes;  These are a few of the gays that I know.

Dewdrops on buttocks and whiskers on bear cubs.  Bright shiny blue eyes and sex on a bear rug.  Brown supple packages hung in black thongs  These are the summer things for which I long...    Hee hee!

But my favorite thing would have to be sitting my butt down on my couch all day and watching cartoon network or disney channel with oreos and chex mix and 2-3 bottles of water handy :)  and my mom out of the house.  btw, I live in cali and it's practically summer all year round.

2kJKwpEEaa	I was married to a woman for ten years, and yes, I was in love with her when I married her.  I never had any problem with the sex part of the relationship, but she was the only woman I ever had those kinds of feelings for.    Marriage wasn't all that great an idea.  All I had on my mind after a few weeks of marriage was the desire to be with a man.  I think you're fooling yourself if you think you would have never looked at anyone else again.  Marriage is long and life is short, especially if you marry in the closet, so to speak.|`|WoFkYJOnaa	I'm gay and I've dated, been in love with and had sex with one girl. I came close to being a father too.|`|ox4tmOpJaa	There are gray areas of sexuality that most people do not talk about much. Some people fall into that area. They are the gay, straight and bi people that fall in love with someone of a gender; that is not the gender they are normally attracted too. Some people are more emotional when it comes to their sexuality.  So think and ask yourself this:     You are a gay single male that is and have been looking for a man/husband to share your life with. You meet a woman that you come to find you have a emotional attachment too. You become close friends. After a while you know that you have come to love her. She has come to love you too. Could you accept it? Would you be willing to give up something you have been looking for, but with a man, just because it was a woman? Or would you say to hell with it and love her and let her love you anyway?     Some call this pansexuality. Some say it is just another label. I say it is the gray area that people are afraid to really think about. It goes against most of what we are taught as we grow. It challenges our minds to accept new things. It makes us accept that we may not be all that we thought we were. And It makes us question what we would really be willing to risk for love. Sadly many will never come to think of this, so they may let the love of their life pass them by because they didnt bother to look. Others may not be able to accept it and let them pass on by. And some, the few, will accept where love is found.     There have been many people over the years that fall into the gray area that something happens to make their relationship end. A break up, a death, etc. And when this happens they go back to the gender(s) that they were attracted to in the first place. Sexuality is far from black and white just as are emotions.     To answer your question; I say the answer is very much a yes. They just have over come their own thoughts & emotions and what society teaches, but dont understand. Anyone can fall in love with anyone, it just comes down to can they accept it though most would say I am wrong.|`|E5iFR6BJaa	Ehm.....I never had any. Yeah, I feel close with several women in my life. So close that we even cry when we are going to a different college.    But, despite all of the feelings, it's just....something different than someone that I want to spend my life with. It has to be a man, nothing else.|`|9J43pXtIaa	Yes, i have "met" the girl of my life. Unfortunately, i "met" her through xbox live. ): but i completely fell in love with her looks (( seen pictures through her myspace )), her voice (( we talked on the phone and thru xbox live )), and her play on words (( we text )). i never treated or looked at another girl the same was as i loved her. we don't talk anymore as we used to.   to this day i still love her, but when i asked her what she thinks "we" are to one another, she says she doesn't even know. v__v i guess we're not even friends...one things for sure...she's the only girl for me no matter what. (:|`|ZQslmW5xaa	Yes, it does happen once in a while.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	You love who you love. Your heart sees the goodness not the sex (my opinion)|`|KlkUj6uFaa	Yes, lots.     Not me personally and I doubt it ever would, but I have friends who it has happened too.|`|2uUctFHEaa	yes but the basterd moved away, just look at my name...................|`|d9zLKgg9aa	no . but i have had crushes on guys that i went crazy for when i was like 8 :P.. but no i have never  had feelings for a man as to the point of marrying them|`|fFmbBRbcaa	i could marry my best friend but i dont think i could ever see myself having sex with her|`|AyEkA6Flaa	Sigh.  I married a woman!  That was a mistake, but I did have romantic feelings for her.  Looking back, not as intense as for a guy, but the feelings were there.    Keep in mind, that you may be 90% gay and she fit perfectly into that other 10% of you.|`|MhfneF0xaa	Yes.    Been there, done that. Same story.    I don't know that there's anything else to say.|`|po4j4xhAaa	No, I haven't.  I really haven't.  I have male friends who I love dearly - but only as friends.|`|AA12006309	Yes, I've had them for both males and females.  I married the first one (big mistake), and subsequently divorced him.  The girl.. was very very flighty, so I never had the chance to try to build anything with her.|`|2a31fdee1fddb6a3055ca7fae75fc902aa	Nope.. I tried to like guys but it just didn't happen.

I've been lookin around a lot  You've got somethin I need  Ooooh I got a brand new pair of rollerskates and you got a brand new key|`|ddWK5JRKaa	Lol they should write a funny song about it. Actually, I don't know any of the words besides those:    I got a brand new pair of roller skates, you got a brand new key.      I bet it has to do with sharing them so they can both enjoy the skates.    Not having a friendship anymore is kind of like losing a key to a great pair of skates and never getting to enjoy the fun of skating, at least as long as the key stays missing.  That would totally piss me off (not necessarilly better than pissing on me).  I wonder what I'd do if such a friendship ever happened in my life.  What would you do?|`|HgRYP3cJaa	get together and try them out!|`|AyEkA6Flaa	Stick your key in my boot, and we'll find out! =P
RHyPeNmgaa	thats not true... he was a free spirit..ppl can be *******|`|0KR4wyoQaa	I love Bob Marley!    He's the best|`|HfZeQR4Aaa	Bob Marley was angry that his father abandoned him, not because he was white. Bob Marley's music was to uplift poor Jamaican people. His music then spread throughout the world. He never intended to be a pop icon. Bob Marley was teased by blacks in his country because he was half white.    Here is a quote from Bob Marley: "My father was white and my mother black, you know. Them call me half-caste, or whatever.  Well, me dont dip on nobodys side.  Me dont dip on the black mans side nor the white mans side.  Me dip on Gods side, the one who create me and cause me to come from black and white, who give me this talent.      'Nuf said.

Blessings|`|J6OIYcIiaa	Im not even going to argue if there is a god or not.  Right now lets assume there is god from the judeo/christian bible (simply because a majority of americans worship that god, so im assuming thats the god you are talking about).  Now, considering what god is in the bible, i believe he is the last person/thing that i would ever love.  Have you ever read the bible?   God approves slavery.   He says its ok to kill your wife and kids.  He says its ok to beat your wife and kids.  He says its ok to kill every man, woman, and child in a conquered city.  He says its ok to sell your daughter into SEX SLAVERY.    Now, is that the kind of god that you love?   Thats more of a tyrant to me.|`|de109ccf1349bcb7dcc5e78fb10fcbe6aa	actually considering who and what god is... NO  Read your bible, the god you follow is a murderer, gets his kicks by turning over his most faithful follower to be tortured. I personally see no love in the old testament only fear.  Oh wait...  I guess if you were afraid of his "wrath" you would feel you need to tell him you love him to appease him huh.   (Just my opinion, I'm not trying to change you mind, just voicing my feelings about this subject.)

See the girl at the top with her butt showing...now why would a girl take a picture like that if it weren't all about her and the "good" attention she thinks she's getting when in reality she looks like trash.|`|mSFjbetxaa	It seems to me that Christian fundies are more concerned with the bedrooms of all other people instead of following the teachings of Jesus.        When Jesus Christ said that what you judge of others will be your sentence.

LOL    I'm a pansexual transgender in love with a heterosexual man who looks like a man with really long hair. :D    If you like men, you're not a lesbian.

5ofS2qQYaa	You want advice on how to make Muslim friends and pass the time in a halal way?    1. Independent Activities (besides prayer and reading the Qur'an)         take up a hobby, try out new recipes, walk around the park, read a book, learn a new language, answer questions on Y!A, reorganize things over and over...         A typical summer day when I'm not working would go like this: walk in the morning w/friend, make something new for brunch, sew or repair clothes, make something for lunch, watch movie borrowed from library or book, spend some time online watching youtube, dinner, read/movie/family time, sleep    2. Making friends:        if you cannot spend as much time as you'd like at the masjid, you can still try to make use of the times you are available to go. the next time you go, just ask around, say you're new and are looking for sisters near by and I'm sure you'll leave w/numbers to muslim neighbors.        you can speak w/your neighbors as well, of course. The best way to introduce yourself is to invite the wives living near by for a brunch or something. They may be able to tell you about other muslims in the area if they know of such. not only muslims, but anyone from your nationality to make it easy to get accustomed (if you are an immigrant).             You just have to make due w/what you have and hope for it to lead to more solid community later on insha'allah    :)    Allah(swt) knows best|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	Honestly none of anyone's business but Allah SWT and her.|`|9oQ0AwiBaa	You have pretty much described my situation! I would like 2 see a social group of muslimahs meet regularly in my US midwest area, maybe just hang out, maybe do volunteering or advocate work. I just wish I knew where others are near me. I've yet 2 go 2 my local masjid but did contact them and met up with a female member 2 get some information, but no one my age    And actually, it could be a group of pious, and not just muslimahs, women who live as well as they can.    Inshallah! At least there are online groups!
ywCTRpCiaa	Um...well mine is kinda X rated, and I don't mean to be gross...but hey you asked right?    A couple weeks ago, I had a horrible hangover because I don't drink that often.  My husband made a move on me the next morning and I said no because my stomach was going nuts!  Well I ended up giving in and being on top, and after a few wild minutes, we started smelling something funky...yea, I poo'd all over him and our bed and didn't even realize it because the hangover had me messed up so bad.  If it had been anyone besides my husband, I would have died right there.  To top it all off, he said "Don't worry babe, $hit happens."|`|q5lreoiWaa	I hardly need to revisit that uncomfortable situation in an open forum,|`|UBypaQtFaa	ummm....I'm too embarrassed to tell you.|`|e9b42ac8a912e015d7f788d8805b5512aa	well this mortified me at the time..    I went into the bathroom at a bookstore with my sister and I could swear that we were the only ones who entered. BUT what I didn't know that there was a lady behind my sister. Anyways, my sister stayed by the sinks and I went into the stall - so did the other lady who I thought was my sis. She peed for like five minutes and me thinking it was my sister I said "Man Jen! you really had to go!!" I didn't hear anything so I bent down and saw that it was someone else's shoes. I was so embarrassed that I stayed in the stall until she left!|`|mQ5v9KUWaa	Okay this happened when I was like 7 in elementary school. Well I had to pee really bad. So I went to the bathroom, and when I came back inside it was suddenly silent. I went over to my friend to talk (because this was at snack time) and she wispered "ughh lena, your skirts tucked into your underwear) so I look down in horror and find my pink glittery skirt (yeah I know) tucked in my underwear.

D:    It was at least a few minutes before someone told me. The hallways had alot of people and they were laughing and staring, but i didn't know why until a girl shouted, "EXCUSE ME MISS!

HoZm5jadaa	1. Reduce it to their simple sentences first   None  [is/are] here yet. NONE IS HERE. Therefore the correct word to use is the linking verb "is" to refer to the singular subject "none" . The word "students" is only an object of the preposition "of ".   None of the students [is] here yet. ----- is Correct     2.Someone, is the subject and take note it is in singular form. It is the same as the words somebody, anyone and anybody. These words are singular. There is a twist in this... you can use "their" if for example Mary was assigned to look after the umbrellas of a group and she forgot them. But in your second sentence you referred to one umbrella only. Therefore....  Someone forgot [his] umbrella. I wonder whose it is. ------,... is Correct  and use his  since gender is not clear.    3. A basketball team --- or simply "A team" is the subject . Again this is singular because it is a collective noun (many things referred as 1)  In the second statement it is "implied" that it is referring to the "team"    the pronoun "It" has been deleted or dropped but its existence is implied. The same as the shortest complete sentence ---Go! --it is from "You go!" ... You is being dropped but when you hear it you know it is referring to you.  Therefore  A basketball team is relatively small. "It" [Doesnt] have as many members as baseball team. -----is Correct    4. In your second sentence, I suppose you want to refer to your family's members. You can then change your subject to "Members" and make your previous subject an object of a preposition referring to the new subject.   Members of my family are loving and supportive. They are always ready to help me. -------CORRECT One    It is grammatically wrong to say:  My families are loving and supportive. They are always ready to help me.    Not unless you have two or more families. You don't want to imply something, true or not , to others about a secret as you state something like that. Do you?|`|ecOfV8Blaa	1 - are  2 - their  3 - doesn't  4 - the first sentence is correct|`|jdKTs3aHaa	None of the students [are] here yet.  Someone forgot [their] umbrella. I wonder whose it is.

You have to change family to families to use [are]|`|80841aafba2cedde2f2f011d05e695d2aa	None of the students is here yet (None is a singular noun)    Someone forgot his umbrella. (Without prior information, you use the masculine)    A basketball team is relatively small. [It] doesn't have as many members as a baseball team    The correct one is " My family is loving and supportive. They are always ready to help me"     The reason is that "family" is a singular noun even if it has a plural meaning. However, when you talk about the members of the family, you use the plural pronoun "they"|`|KBBonf97aa	"None of the students is here yet."  Because "none" is a shortened version of "not one" the verb must be singular.  If you break down the subject into separate words, the rule becomes clearer.  "Not one of the students is here yet," as opposed to, "Not one of the students are here yet."     "Someone forgot his or her umbrella."  You can't use "their" unless the umbrella is collectively owned by several people, since "their" refers to more than one person.  And since "one" is part of "someone," it can only refer to a single person.      "A basketball team is relatively small.  A family doesn't have as many members as a basketball team."  You'd have to use "doesn't" in the second sentence because it's a contraction for "does not."  A family is a single unit comprised of several people.  A team is also singular.  "Players" refers to several people, but "team" refers to a single unit.  Here are two more examples of how the singular/plural nouns and verbs work together:  "A family does things together."  "Family members do things together."  A singular subject (even if it's a collective noun and refers to many things lumped together) must have a singular verb.  A plural subject must have a plural verb.    "My family is loving and supportive."  That's correct.  But you'd have to change the second sentence to make it grammatically correct, since the word "they" is plural and references "family," which is singular.  Probably the least awkward way to do that would be to change the first sentence to, "My family members are loving and supportive."  That way, it would work with the existing second sentence.    "My family are loving and supportive."  That's incorrect, since you can't use a plural verb like "are" with a singular subject like "family."  Again, that could be corrected by changing the subject from "family" to "family members."    Hope this makes sense to you, since it's the sort of thing over which I obsess.  My inner dork likes to come out and play.

The MAIN and I guess for them the most important messenger was Jesus.     Most atheists will not deny that a man with this name existed at some point and time. As it is there is no proof that he didn't. It is peoples claim to his divinity is what is called into question.  Most atheists will even go so far as to say "if such a MAN did exist he would seem to be pretty cool IF he existed", but again they will question the claim of divinity.    Where people seem to clash is, there is a 2000 year old book of words, that some say IS the word of a diety that he IS the author, that this man jesus IS his son and himself as the diety or that this book of words was "inspired" but written by man.  Since the making of this book of words, it has been mistranlated, misinterpretted, misused so much throughout history (hence the different denominations all believing they are the one true way), that the original message from this messenger seems to have gotten lost.    I know I am going to get thumbs down and hated for what I have just said but, christians will tell you themselves. No man is perfect, every man is fallible, so does it not bring into question that if what they say is true, and the book of words are just man written, then it would only be reasonable to ignore alot of the messengers (especially NOW) behind religions?|`|tZx9Bm97aa	theres usually some parlor tricks, and suddenly everyone is afraid and hopeful of what this sleight of hand jesus can do for them|`|N28zLxtpaa	Probably because we think the people that wrote the story you are talking about made the story up to try to create some sort of moral rules for people to follow.

Look at all the countless places you could go and things you could experience!    Now, as a pagan, I believe in reincarnation.  Yes, the soul is immortal, but you have existence after existence until you become something more than what you are now, at which time you go on to be guide to others and, again, have limitless places to go, and things to see and do, since the universe is also endless.

Historically the punishment would often be being hung, drawn and quartered or for women being burnt alive, this no longer applies. Life imprisonment is the MAXIMUM sentence now so it is possible that your sentence could infact be less.    EDIT    After reading further it seems women got off easy by being burned alive... read what being hung, drawn and quartered means:     1. Dragged on a hurdle (a wooden frame) to the place of execution.      2. Hanged by the neck for a short time or until almost dead (hanged).     3. Disembowelled (disembowlment is the act of removing of some or all of the vital organs, usually from the abdomen) and emasculated (emasculated is the act of removing the genitalia of a male, notably the penis and/or the testicles) and the genitalia and entrails burned before the condemned's eyes (drawn)     4.

A life sentence in England and Wales is a prison term of indeterminate length; in some exceptionally grave circumstances, however, a recommendation can be made that the life sentence should mean life.      The Criminal Justice Act of 2004 also suggested that a 30-year minimum should also apply to the worst single murders, including those committed as an act of terrorism.  The killing of the monarch or a murder of a member of the royal family would obviously fall into this category as would the assassination of the prime minister.|`|1emjRMeDaa	It would probably be a huge punishment.

Ezekiel 18:20 The soul that sins, it shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.     James 1:15 Then the lust, when it hath conceived, bears sin: and the sin, when it is full grown, bringeth forth death.     Hebrews 9:27 And inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this comes the judgment;     Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.     Romans 14:12 So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.

You can also try going somewhere that there's is ghost appearances or actions, but becareful because the ghosts that make themselves known is for a reason...they're mad,sad, or something.

So, don't blame them that they are too picky. Plus Paul made the following comment:    3 Finally, brothers, carry on prayer for us, that the word of Jehovah may keep moving speedily and being glorified just as it is in fact with YOU; 2?and that we may be delivered from harmful and wicked men, for faith is not a possession of all people.|`|sW6lxVFOaa	There has not been any reasonable proof yet of god existing.

It makes them laugh that you would even take the time to try to prove God to them.  Their minds are closed and until they open them up for intelligent thinking, you're just wasting your time.  That is what Jesus meant when he said, "Cast not your pearls before swine."      Now before you atheists get mad and report me, I was not calling you a swine.  It is a metaphor.

Rkg4CM9jaa	It depends on that person's outlook on race and culture. It has little to do with their sexual preferences.    Someone can be open-minded and only date people of their own race because it's convenient or familiar.    Someone can be a racist but still be attracted to another race sexually.    Example:     White slave owners having sex with their female African slaves before the Civil War. Impregnating them with mixed children, and then selling those mixed children into slavery.    Asian girls dating only White men for money and status. White men using Asian girls as sex toys .... while still hating Asian people in general.|`|92iuiuZKaa	Because they are willing to get to know some of a different race/ethnicity, no matter what society thinks|`|ncdTxID9aa	In some ways it does because that person is different culturally, but two people may come from the same environment with the same beliefs, anyway that's just one aspect of being open minded.|`|da4zS4AOaa	Never heard of that. I really don't care about people's opinion. It's just that they happened to get attracted to someone different. Which is nice. I wonder which year interracial relationships will be considered normal and not receiving stares while walking together down the street|`|MyV9qm99aa	Interracial relationships, although a rising occurrence, are a very controversial topic in America's society today. On one side of the spectrum there are those who approve of interracial dating. One source insists that it is God's will to have interracial relationships(Christianson). Some people even go as far as believing that interracial relations stop the rate of racism. Most importantly, the people who believe in these relationships say that love is colorblind. No matter what color the person may be, you can love the person for who they are(Stokes). Although many people are for interracial relationships, there are still people who are stuck in their own ways and do not want to surrender to this new way of life. Many of their reasons are based on stereotypes and what the media sees to be true. Most importantly, the people who are against interracial relationships feel that interracial relations corrupt cultures as well as ethics(Jue). Whatever the reason, everyone has their own view on interracial relationships. There are those who strongly disagree with these relationships because they are corrupting our culture(Jue). Although, those who approve interracial relationships feel that love is colorblind and that God created all of us equal(Christianson).Many people who believe that interracial dating is wrong are from past generations. These people are set in their ways and will not change their opinion about the subject of multiracial couples. They see interracial dating as a bad change in the world and that two different races together as one causes too many problems(Stokes). People have gone as far to multiracial couples. They see interracial dating as a bad change in the world and that two different races together as one causes too many problems(Stokes). People have gone as far to marriage and mating continues, the white race will eventually become extinct."(Strom 28)    GOD BLESS|`|azKH25wZaa	Being open-minded, to me, means opening your heart to all races, not just one. If a white guy ONLY dates black women...he is not open-minded.|`|3OL7vVLuaa	Well -- if you're only dating a certain race -- then I'd say that's closed minded. If you're selecting people to date based on what race they are -- I'd say that's close minded. You should be open to human beings.... it's personality, attitude and beliefs that matter -- people put all this emphasis on race and race doesn't have a darn thing to do w/ staying in love and having a good relationship -- if it did -- then there wouldn't be so many divorces!! lol|`|xUxUwloPaa	It kind of depends on your situation. If you have never had the oppurtunity to date out of your race than that is one thing. For most of us, we have met people outside of our race that are smart, good-looking, fun etc.. The people that don't date outside of their race because they are "uncomfortable with it" are close-minded.|`|2Cu76lqsaa	Doesn't look like anyone actually answered your question  I don't thnk those type of people are open minded at all|`|1842c18e2b8f922c49d387bfc336ea46aa	I have found people that date interacially to be open-minded.  They are obviously aren't racist and usually nice to other people.

There are generally two things to consider:    1) You must be able to breather freely. So sitting straight (but not stiff) is OK.    2) The position must be one in which you find it easy to stay alert.    Chair position is good for most westerners. If you also get into martial arts or yoga, you might eventually move on to half-lotus, full lotus or seiza, which are even better for breathing, but which also can get very uncomfortable (or even impossible!) to untrained people.  But right now, don't worry about it. There is nothing wrong with the chair position.|`|DArAz67Caa	meditation is a buddhist practice-----drop the notion and pray instead--|`|847ab32dc15c849d022c11323ad7db39aa	Sure.

UbNUwcDzaa	I'm a native Spanish speaker, and believe me, it doesn't make learning french a lot easier. Sure, there are a lot of words that have the same roots, but french grammar is very difficult. There are a lot of letters that are written but not pronounced, various accents, lots of vocals, and lots of vocals compared to Spanish or English. So, it is difficult. But it is also a beautiful language and if you already know Spanish, I would advise you to learn French. There's no such thing as learning too much, experience a new thing.|`|8OBF6yznaa	french is easy 2 me|`|ecOfV8Blaa	A little bit.

Knowing some Spanish would definitely help as both languages are really close (both come from Latin).    French grammar is more difficult but knowing some Spanish conjugation will help you. Vocabulary is often very close.    You can buy a program such as rocket French language (http://www.rocketfrenchlanguage.com) to complement your class. But it seems you will be quit busy. You can make it if you commit yourself about 15 minutes a day though. But do you have that?     In any, I wish you the best.

Absolutely shocking!    I've seen my share of "quacks". Here's a short story.  We had a doctor here (from a middle eastern country) who hospitalized a 54 year old woman with abdominal pain.  She was close to death, when her family moved her to another hospital, where she underwent immediate surgery for a bowel obstruction. A week later, she was at home recuperating.  The first doctor said, "Well, she's 54, her children are grown, her life is over".  He's still working his witch craft!|`|BMEHg4s0aa	that's why its called practicing medicine|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I have gone to a few in clinics over the years that have been paid by  state vouchers. I once had a doctor in Phoenix, show a new doctor  who was an assistant, that I had Scoliosis of the spine. He traced  the letter 'S" over my spine, and asked the young man, if he could  see the shape of a letter "S". The young man, said he did. I've since  asked a few doctors since, if I had that defect, and was told 'no'. So  what the older doctor was trying to convince the young one of, I'll  never know.    I know I have to be alert to VA primaries and doctors. As they often  feel they know everything, and make the wrong diagnosis, or in fact,  they just don't now, but won't admit it. Due to that, I have landed in  the ER of two private hospitals where I got better help and care and  I got well. I'm actually afraid of the VA ER, just from my normal  care. You can't just assume your doctor knows what's best for you.  You have to read and study up on the health issues you have and  then know what the treatment should be. It doesn't hurt to ask the  doctor if he knows what he's doing. It's your body and your life. And  you are just a name and number in a file drawer.|`|7xGtL1vxaa	You are the Quack.

I also went to one for panic disorder that wanted to "induce" a panic attack so he could teach me how to handle it. That's a crappy feeling, as anyone knows who's ever had a panic attack. I didn't feel that he understood my problem and left and found a better doctor.

09ef400ecd1475bf913602053ad3f68aaa	You are so right. Self esteem is a sense of self worth, which can only come from our value in gods eyes. The struggle is to stay the course with god, despite all loss of valueless gain in this world, and know that god loves you to pieces and will never leave you.    I also think that self reflection is neccesary for spiritual growth, and some who have a high self worth/ pride often times miss out on the greatest part of this journey. A Low self esteem, can in some instances originate from humility and reverence to god .. and recognition as to exactly how sinful .. our sin really is.|`|icaatrmhaa	You are so true. I like what the first person said, "God-esteem".  We should only care about what God thinks of us and what we think of ourselves. He made us the way He wants us and that's   all we need to know. It doesn't matter what others say or think.    God bless!!!|`|6lJuKKMHaa	It should be "God-esteem" we should be seeking.  |`|jg5Ii27Vaa	if i didn't like myself, then that would mean that God made a mistake. if there are certain things i don't like myself (weight for example) then i could change it to make myself more healthy because my body is a temple and i am to care for it.     but peer pressure can really bring some people down.|`|6WQo6RpSaa	It's kinda hard to be proud of your faith (especially on the internet) when there are so many atheists just waiting to insult you or make fun of you for it. I mean, I know that not all atheists are like that, but it seems that most of the self-proclaimed ones on the internet have little more to say than "how can u believe in sumthing thats not proven? ha! ur so stuppid for believing in some sky daddy without any proof about it! lulz"....I just don't get how to be super proud of my faith when words like that await around almost every corner (especially in the R&S section here) =/|`|KmnbjZIdaa	We all fall short of the ideals of christianity in various ways.

If you actually like the opposite sex, and same sex, equally, or one more than the other, than you're bisexual.    Otherwise, you're not. If you're doing it just for show, then I mean, how could this question even be asked? :l|`|a7IAkpJtaa	you like both girl and boy. both are interset you.|`|hlDYxtdqaa	you're right. alot of people are coming out as bi lately. What you need to do, is expierment! safely of course, using protection. I noticed you said "i'm bi" but then went on to say you didn't know if you were or not...well if you don't know,  you must not be bi! What makes you think you are? Do you have an emotional bond with girls? How about a sexual one? what is it that you like about guys? this is a question only you can answer love!    good luck!
VFmmVHGVaa	I didn't find God he found me.  t|`|97oxJ0B8aa	Yep.  Romans Chapter One.  I believe it.  I think it actually applies in real life to "heathen" tribes.  It says they've been given evidence, and that they have had to decide whether to give God credit or not for what he has revealed to him through his creation.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Yes, I would have the 'feeling' that there was 'something far bigger than myself and this world' even if I had never heard of God or gods in any form.  I believe that it is that feeling in the earliest of mankind that 'separated' us from all of the other animals in the world ... and made us 'supreme' over all others in the 'genesis stories' from every culture.  There is really very little difference betwen cultures that are far separated by time and space ... the 'supreme being' that started in a 'garden like' setting with the 'creation' and the setting there of the first man ... and his 'mate' ... there was a 'trickster' to lead those people astray that led them out of this 'small heaven' and into this world, and now we should try to 'get back' to that small heaven or move on to the larger Heaven (God's universe) ... but we must always be aware of 'the trickster' and what he can do to 'stop us' if and when we 'stop believing' in a God or gods.  If it wasn't for the similarities between these genesis storied from everywhere on earth, I might be more likely to believe your theory that God does not exist ... but I will 'go with mankind' in general, and I will and do believe in God now, forever and beyond ... and I have a feeling that I'll see you in Heaven someday (even if you never 'believe' here on Earth, in this life) .. what will you 'believe about' me?|`|Yz8Ysagiaa	Yes.|`|d938becd9c20c43cfbbbca1473443b4aaa	its a proven fact that they would...it is in human nature to long for a creator or a personal God...but most of these people had bad experences growing up and now claim to be Athiest|`|Lc5FtItDaa	Yes  At least people report that they did when they convert.|`|8fp5dSW4aa	Good question.

It's really complicated.

Ba8dLZIwaa	A tragic hero must have these five things:  1. high stature (king)  2. flaw  3. downfall  4. enlightenment  5. death    - He is not only King of Thebes, but Prince of Corinth    -Oedipus' flaw is that he was blind to the life that he was leading. Blind to what Tiresias, Creon, and the two messengers were telling him.    -Downfall was when Jocasta killed herself, when Oedipus stabbed his own eyes out and was banished from Thebes    -Enlightenment occured when he finally realized at the end that he in fact killed his father and married his mother    I don't really know how he dies since I wasn't required to read that far|`|TzodCxhgaa	Well, its sort of lame that you cant think for yourself, given that this topic is quite fascinating and the least you can do is show that you are not just an idiot, but an idiot who is willing to put effort into his work.     Anyway, first you must dissect the concepts tragic and hero. Search for definitions on online dictionaries. Then go to google books and search for the above keywords. Look at ten relevant books (the ones that are related to classics) that mention the above keywords.     Dont forget that a hero is someone who has redeeming qualities, someone who the (ignorant and vain) audiences can relate to. Also, remember that Tragedy is often related to Fate. Fate is like a genetic predisposition, and it cant be escaped. A Tragic Hero is a Paradox - he is an outcome of Fate and of Free Will. The more he struggles, the more he suffers.|`|b6cd9d6fe5a0ec1d495444c45c2b75f2aa	I'm not one who is interested in doing another's work, but I am willing to give you a few helpful pointers.     Definition of a Tragic Hero:  a literary character who makes an error of judgment or has a fatal flaw that, combined with fate and external forces, brings on a tragedy (from dictionary.com)    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragic_hero  http://shakespeare.learnhub.com/lesson/p...    A quick outline of Oedipus' life:  -Father, the King of Thebes, went to Delphi and was told that his son would kill him  -Father left Oedipus to die in mountains, but is rescued  -Oedipus goes to Delphi and is told that he will kill his father and marry his mother  -To prevent this, he leaves his foster father whom he believes to be his real father  -On his travels, he gets into a quarrel with the company of a rich man, and kills them. The rich man is his father, the king.   -Comes to Thebes and beats the Sphinx's riddle.   -People of Thebes are grateful and welcome him as a hero  -Oedipus marries the dead king's wife, Jocasta (his mother, prophesy is fulfilled)  -Famine comes to Thebes, and Oedipus goes to oracle to find out how to bring about the end of the famine  -He is told that the famine will end when the murderer of the king is punished  -Jocasta figures out who Oedipus really is, and kills herself  -Oedipus figures out that he truly did kill his father and marry his mother, and blinds himself    Hope this helps.
CfZn9kK5aa	Very dark. Very very dark. And yet lovely, beautiful even. It reads smoothly. Despite that most of it rhymes, and you would expect it all to because of that (I am aware that poetry does not need to rhyme), even the parts that don't rhyme work well.     Excellent and powerful piece.  --     Why I think it's good.    I think it reads smoothly, both in my head, and aloud. Thats right, I sat here, and read it out loud and didn't 'choke' on the words at all. I simply read it, and it came out smoothly.     While it does repeat the word Love a lot, I do not think that it ruins it at all. It adds to the feel and the way it reads. I do not think the feeling of it would come across nearly as strongly or clearly with out it. There are no real rules in poetry. Putting rules to it destroys it. If you try to follow silly rules, and just what OTHER poets do, then your own work, your own feelings, your creativity gets lost.     If poets only did, what other poets did, all poetry would be the same, and we would not have the beautiful variety that we have today.     Love doesn't understand age. How do I know? I fell in love when I was 12/13 (looong time ago, hard to remember), and to this day... I still feel that love for her. I had to move on, I am now married.. but I still feel that love for her. Still feel the need to call every now and then to see if she's alright.     I fail to see any vagueness. The words are strong, powerful, and meaningful.     "A good poem makes someone think, feel, AND breathe deeply in awe."     Only the poet can tell you what the poem should do. But generally, I've never "breathed deeply in awe" over poems such as this. Why?  Tragic and sad poems are not awe inspiring. They are pain inspiring, they bring you sadness. They should touch you deep inside, but never cause awe. Awe is quite the opposite of what a sad poem should feel like. This poem makes me think about my friends and my family, the people who I have loved and lost. It reminds my of some one very close to me who killed her self over love. It evokes in me that same sadness that I felt all those years ago. And THAT is what a poem such as this should do.     A poem should make you feel first and foremost. The rest depends on the poem.     The repetition of the word Love in the poem, does not seem to take away from it, and it certainly does not currupt the flow of the poem. But rather, each time the word Love is said, it brings it to the forefront. It makes the cause of her suffering clear, and makes it all the more tragic and heart filled.     Recommended poems,    Plaint, by Ebenezer Elliott  Bells, by Edgar Allen Poe    Recommended reading  http://www.poems-and-quotes.com/article....         I would also like to say, that I think this would make a lovely song.  -------------  I have been reminded of a poem about the rules of poetry that I read..    THE RULES OF POETRY  by  Douglas Florian    Keep it short.  Leave it long.  Use bad grammar.  Spell words wrong.  Let the letters  All f           a             l               l               down.  Print a few lines  Upside down.  Change the rhythm.  Never rhyme.  Force the meter  All the time.  Find your keys.  Lose your tools.  By the way --  THERE ARE NO RULES!  ------  To stifle the nay-sayers, I posted this in the Poetry section, and it got rave reviews from most of the people.    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...     Only 9 out of 39 people had any thing negative to say at all. And some of those, liked it, and just added something constructive.|`|51iRexDoaa	sounds like spam|`|oiPrycbJaa	Okay I studied Literature so let me give you my opinion and constructive criticism.    I would say it's easily an amatuer.  Word choice is vague, too much redundant repetition.  There is definitely a lot of things missing in a good poem.    For example, there isn't much rhythm.  I don't feel the flow.  Read it aloud and you see that you choke on your words.  Too much "love".    Also, rhyming alone doesn't make a poem good, although I must say you score in the rhyming.    Next, I don't suppose poets would repeat a word too often unless there's an emphasis they want to create. As for yours, you might say, yes, you want to emphasize on Love.  But it doesn't work that way. Repetition and emphasis in a poem comes with hidden meaning.    Lastly, if you're just starting to write poems, I strongly caution against the cliche subject on Love. How old are you? Do you really know about love?    I wrote my share of cheesy poems in my early high school days (I'm still in high school though) and likened them to my perception of "love", and I got unsavoury comments from the big poets.    Now if you hate my comments and opinions, I suggest you put this piece in the "poetry" section. There will be more experienced critics there to judge you, should you doubt my capability in literature.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	wow thats a really cool poem!|`|J1XwqvLGaa	Fantastic poem!

More often than not, mine were made from the skirts of dresses my mom once wore.  There used to be a lot of fabric in those things, and we often made "new"  garments from those and the ones we purchased at the church rummage sales.    One of my favorite pieces was a "pencil skirt"  made from drapery material.  It was a brocade in silver with some pink woven through it and finished off with a waistband of pink satin.  Though where she got hold of that bit of satin I don't recall.  There were four of us girls and our baby brother.      My only experience with a Toni perm  was  burnt ends and frizz.   My mom wasn't too good with those and I never asked for one again.     She stayed home and took care of us, earning a bit of extra by taking in laundry.  Ironing is a lost art.

Some   schools favored the penny loafer, rather than saddles or white bucks.  But when the shifts and sacks and chemises were in style, those  were worn with black flats and nylons, for a dressier look.      I remember thos stinky home perms for sure. It took over a week  to get that smell out. I usually had to wait til I was able to wash it,  before the smell had dissapated a bit. I can still smell the strong odor  of that solution poured over my curlers while I held a towell over my  eyes and face. That was pure torture. Then I'd have an attack from  the fumes.

I took really good care of them because they had to last the whole school year.        Mother made more dressed for me out of her old ones cut down.  I felt lucky to have nice clothes and shoes for school.

My favorite was a pair of shorts with big, beautiful orange/brown  roosters on them--obviously from a chicken feedsack.    And we never "shopped" for school clothes--we sat down with the Sears and Roebucks' catalog and put big checkmarks next to the dresses, etc. that we wanted.  Remember undies with the days-of-the-week embroidered on them? Wow! How cool was THAT? I remember the dresses, mostly plaid, coming in packs of 3-4.    I remember the Toni perms.  They STUNK!, my older sister usually gave my mother one out on the yard and you could smell it for weeks.  I got my first perm in much the same matter.  What a kink-a-fied, frizzy mess!  She also gave my poor little niece (who's 3 yrs younger than me) one.  We looked and were treated like FREAKS!  I can still remember standing under the big willow tree at grade school and glumly shuffling my saddle shoes against the roots.  Nobody would play with us with that Bozo the Clown hair!|`|2liwk8yKaa	Not sure if the same but we wore mumus in the early 60s and they were like a sack only brightly coloured.

62364eb8ec72973c388641049ba83389aa	Within the United States any American who doesn't fit into being a xenophobic hateful, bias bigoted opinionated religious American are discriminated.     The three main groups of American people who get discriminated by them in the United States are .....    1  All American Women : who are treated like and better than second class citizens, and don't receive equal pay, benefits or same employment or work conditions as men and are discriminated as being the lower sex of American Society.    2  All American LGBT persons: who are treated no better than pregnant dogs about to have a litter of puppy's on a bed. They are mocked, despised, belittled and looked down at and discriminated as members of American society.    3  All American Disabled, Aged ,War veterans and Homeless: who are all seen as being a burden on and of society, and are treated, discriminated and spoken of as being non humans members of American Society.    All of them "Are Americans" of many races and colors ages, genders,sexual orientations, physically or mentally challenged non or other religious beliefs. Regardless there skin color or race they all face the same discrimination daily as each other, by being Americans.    Who face daily discrimination by xenophobic hateful, bias bigoted opinionated religious Americans, who use there bibles and religion as a tool to discriminate against them.     Who all think it's there god given right to use freedom of speach to discriminate. Rather than using it to make the United States a discrimination free country for same equal rights and freedoms for all Americans to live peacfully together without discrimination.    The Answer is, your fellow Americans born in the USA  like yourself  gets discriminated against by their own fellow Americans born in the USA like yourself. So your own American born race of being American is the most xenophobic discriminated race in America.    It's 2009 and there are still no anti discrimination laws for color, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, physically or mentally challenged or non or other religious beliefs Americans, in the United States.|`|NAL9SZuXaa	whites, hispanics, blacks    Apparently the lighter the skin, the more pleasant it is to be around them.

African American = thanks to MLK, discrimination was greatly reduced but there are still Americans who are racist towards them.  Hispanics - not sure why, I've just heard a lot of nasty things.  Other Immigrants - I think it depends (if the person just immigrated, still new to American customs, doesnt fit in, and has a heavy accent, they are bound to face more discrimination than someone who is non-white and born in America) -- it also greatly depends on people's values: some people are old fashioned and are very racist while others have accepted different races.|`|WYo59zLOaa	us white people, right away they look at us like were bad people.|`|uQfJukisaa	middle eastern  mixed  White and black tie for third|`|2PDmoZxNaa	Least discriminated-- Caucasian  Most discriminated-- Hispanic|`|Wnbq4Klmaa	well, many races do...a few being  -african americans(yes,i know our president but there are still lunatics out there)  -hm spanish people?  -chinese/japenese.|`|56925c4a0ee3ba4db3aeba44dd04ae0aaa	Humans, followed by Greys and then Reptilians.|`|ULitp0PWaa	Anyone who looks Arab.    ?|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	Middle Eastern, then black Americans then Asian|`|d44LwOLYaa	Gaysian like me.

It's definitely White people though. I'm not joking. I'm South Asian by the way. Affirmative action is the greatest example. Minorities get jobs and get into colleges because they're a minority. A White male and a Hispanic with the same application apply for a job, or a college. The Hispanic will get it.     With all the ethic/racial/cultural sensitivity bull in this country these days White people that say something wrong with no malice intended get into all sorts of issues. For example, have you heard a White man say "you people" but they meant something else entirely than what was perceived?|`|bpsIfvyCaa	I would say the one with the least rights these days is the straight white male.

Now, I'm an intelligent person and I know jokes are meant to be funny but she said to me today.    "You sound like a black person"  and I said   "Because I am, maybe?"  "Why would you want to sound stupid"    That's pure insulting, and I dont think I can be friends with her any longer. I think she senses this and now she's showering me with compliments.    They're TASTEless.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	Some are funny and some go too far.|`|d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	Like any joke, whether they're funny or not doesn't hinge upon whether they happen to be racist/sexist/elitist etc.  It all depends upon whether the point of the joke is to get a laugh or be demeaning.  Great humor isn't safe, there's always SOMEBODY who'll be pissed off.  The trick is to avoid having MOST people react that way.    Now, two blondes walk into a bar...|`|VKDLSPFAaa	disgusting   it makes me ashamed i live in a country that still has such racism  there nothing funny about different people  they are probably making fun of you too|`|b2276382725a0bce8479b4c02cdb38b3aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKBKKKLjV...    lol    But anyway, i think for the most part i don't like them. I think there are so many other things talk abt. I mean i will laugh when the occasional comedian says a race joke, but if it were one of my friends i wouldn't allow it. I don't like to 'go there' with my friends, it keeps a level of respect i think between us.    ~chai***OMG Ironix, i have the same issue with some of my friends lol.

dFBccLExaa	Yeah, it's normal. I did a protection spell as my first, and I was nervous that it wasn't going to work. But it did, you just have to have faith in yourself.   As for the cancer, depends on if your sister in law is for spellwork, or if she doesn't like it. Usually, with that sort of thing, I always push towards formatting it to the person's religion of choice. You could easily take a charm or talisman, and charge it with your energies, focusing happiness and healing energies into it, and give it to her to wear. You could also create a mini altar for her, putting happy pictures of her, and bright, lively things as well around. And lastly, you could try contact healing, where you transfer your healthy energy to her, although that can take experience, and learning, as not to transfer any back to you, and not to deplete your own energies.   Email mei f you need more info.|`|hEReEQ5naa	ur a witch wat the heck im not judging just i dont know much about...witches|`|anZirq1baa	You should be more confidant or you may draw negative energy.|`|xzL2oRq9aa	i am Wiccan, and a practicing Witch for six years.     And yes, it is normal. Many believe its because that is what society and uninformed people and parents tell their kids and other people, that Witchcraft is "evil" or the "devils" work. The truth is (and i hope you already know all of this if you are doing spell craft already) that Witches and Wiccans, most Pagans (some do believe in a sense) don't even believe in the "devil" or "satan". Witches believe that mankind is responsible for their own actions and not some "demonic" being.    and with practice, the spells and rituals will flow beautifully.    umm for the thyroid cancer, you might try to do some auric healing (but NEVER stop with her regular treatment or doctors orders!, alternative medicine is here to HELP aid the healing process, along with the doctors of today), If you want to know how to do arua healing yourself, contact me...    )0( Blessed Be )0(    Gabe|`|Tvc6Tmz5aa	Relax. Being a bit nervous is quite natural. May I suggest that you take time to write your own spells and word them exactly as you want them to manifest. A little extra preparation will go a long way in alleviating any apprehension you might be feeling. As far as spells for other people, it is proper to get their permission first. If you unable to obtain their OK for any reason, send healing energy to their higher self with the understanding that if rejected, it will go to where it may be needed.
5zs6eaOEaa	I think it's adorable.   I once dated this amazing Indonesian guy... he didn't know much english, but he would write me the cutest poems.

So what?|`|6BFKt3VGaa	Can he understand basic things like 'that makes me upset' o  'I am happy when I'm with you?"  I have spoken to many people who are still learning English (i'm actually in a language exchange with a Japaneses person who only speaks the very basic English. It is surprisingly easy to communicate if you can see someone face to face. And its astounding how quickly people can and do pick up languages. Maybe you should try to learn his language as well?  I have always had a fascination with languages and I think it would be exciting to date someone who spoke another language.   If you think he will be someone you could truly connect with, then its defiantly something to try out for a while.     And investing in a couldn't hurt. Here are some websites that sell them.   http://www.easytranslators.com/  This has nearly every common language.      The best of luck!! I wish you happiness.|`|4kqvnQtUaa	I have never dated someone with a language barrier, However I have had many friends with a language barrier, I do not find it annoying at all, infact I have tought them English & thay have tought me theire language in return.|`|AA10729675	I do not mind when someone does not speak English fluently.  I mind when I do.  It is embarrassing.

bLGCWCwNaa	so it looks like you don't want a theme...but how about doing a sleep over theme, it could be simple but fun. your invitations could have some sleepover design and your house could be decorated with a few balloons or streamers - nothing big. you could also consider having games to last you all night and make sure this is planned. you could do those simple games like pass the pastel (but make sure to put presents people might like) , pin the tail on the donkey (it doesn't have to be a donkey) , pinata, freeze and go, limbo, truth or dare or even treasure hunt around the house. you should also consider doing party bags - an all time favourite.  good luck!

As far as my friends and partner, they're very supportive.  If they weren't supportive, they wouldn't be my friend.  It's kind of hard for them not to notice, since I'm pretty out about it.  I commonly bind my breasts and dress to pass as male, both with and without my partner with me.    Sometimes it does get confusing for them, but I generally expect that if they are confused, they'd ask me to clarify something for them.  My partner has never been anything but supportive.  He even takes me clothes shopping from time to time (though he HAS borrowed my shirt and tie before...lol).|`|3OZgcntfaa	Everyone who knows me on any personal level knows I'm trans. No one's ever given me grief over it, and are usually curious rather than confused.    Some people get a little mixed up when it comes to my gender identity and how that meshes with my sexuality. By the end of a little bit of discussion and comparison they can wrap their minds around it better though.    Overall, I have a pretty easy time with the people I involve in my life when it comes to the fact that I'm trans. I'm just one of the guys to everyone.

But we learn to adjust!|`|0LKIsD7Oaa	im sure that has something to do with it. family values passed down. i think it also has something to do with where you live, the religion you are, and the economic state that you are in. many angles of a prism if you will.|`|Dkylapi6aa	YES!

Also, I don't know your age... but if you're of high school/college age, there are schools out there that teach modern and Biblical languages. Of course, there is nothing quite like learning a new language in the land in which it is spoken... so get out there whenever you get the chance.

I got myself Michel Thomas mp3 files. There's smth like 10 languages to choose from. I tried at least 7 other brands, and they really didn't work for me. It's fair to say I didn't even learn a word thanks to those. Just because it was so simple, I'm now learning the basics of another language for fun    The problem with all the other audio learning programs I've tried including pimsleur is that they speak way too fast and aren't interesting at all.     If you really want to learn beyond the basics, there's one method that worked well for me. I learned really good Swedish, because after knowing the basics I read a lot of novels by comparing every sentence in the novel in Swedish with the one in the novel in my native tongue. I was able to figure out which word is which by the help of knowing some grammar, though it was slow at first. This method works for you, if you do it with a novel you are into, or are generally more interested in reading a novel than a school text book. Better pick some authors whose language isn't very complicated, such as Paulo Coelho or Hemingway. After this I moved on to audio books. And so after a half a year of reading I was able to fool a native speaker to think I'm a native as well -- judging by my writing online. But you need some oral interaction with native speakers if you want your speech to be fluent. This does not mean you have to go through the trouble of moving to a foreign country, just try find Swedish people online and use Skype (i haven't tried this yet though). (When it comes to Chinese, I'm not sure if this method works because of the different writing system. But just for the record for Chinese learners, you might want to try the "pinyinize" tool that converts the Chinese characters into Western letters and automatically adds spaces between words. The tool can be found on Pop-up Chinese.)    Just for encouragement, I've never lived in an English speaking country, yet I speak

Also, the "h" in the word "mahera" is read like "h" in the word "hope".And finally, all "e" are read like "e" in the word "erotic".|`|Xcri5qeTaa	mahkaira ehdosez, mahchaira tha laveese    The TTS link in the first post has good pronunciation.

62364eb8ec72973c388641049ba83389aa	Yes, France and Australia have great foreign relations and friendships.     There are thousands of French ex pats who live and work and have very successful business's in Australia. Just as there are many Australians who live in France.    The French have adopted Australian, music, beach culture, swimwear and clothing into their culture. You would feel at home being here if you came from France.    Bastille day is celebrated here on the 17th of July each year for the Francophone and Francophile community's. They have had large balls and French festivals in all Australian capital city's since 1911.    Australians are nothing like Americans in etiquette, style and class, culture, social activities, fashion, the arts or sport and leisure activities and in food, wine and fine dining etiquette. Most all Australians, speak, read and write in five or more foreign bilingual languages.    The medical and school education systems here are similar as well with child and personal protection and anti discrimination laws. All citizens in Australia have the same equal rights and freedoms.     There are millions of outdoor bars, cafes and restaurants.  Also thousands of globally known Australian fashion designers personal  luxury fashion, shoes, swimwear  stores and fashion weeks.    The aren't  any cliche's about French people in Australia, my friends who were born in France, love fishing, picnics in the parks or hiring a yacht to go sailing. Drives to the winery's and camping on days off and going out all night clubbing and go shopping.     Maybe the emotional stressed perfectionist  French Chef cliche during a rush period rings true. I have worked for two different French Chefs  while going through university.     Yes they do get quite heated and vocally aggressive under pressure. Until they settle down with a glass of wine and apologise and laugh it off.|`|wuIxDbosaa	I don't know what Riley is on about, but it is true that there is a big French community in Australia.  Although I think that unless you have French friends, Bastille Day is a bit of a non-event.  The French folks I know tend to be from Provence or there abouts.  There are a few French cafes run by French people in my neck of the woods and to be perfectly honest I haven't met a French person I didn't like.  Theres a wonderful little cafe in my home town run by a lovely French couple who have been here 20 or so years, but there are still very much French and very much Australians.  If you ask me its a match made in Heaven.  Its a pity that the French didn't get to the West Coast of Australia before the English, now that would have had much better results I think.|`|2BUCOTaJaa	snobby, and apparently they don't like helping u unless u speak french.
gkoX68Awaa	Reasons for art ? Are you serious ? Art, well, first you would have to define what is art ? That question is still not satisfactorily answered for most people. Is pictures of a crucifix in a jar of urine art ? Some people think so, and yet others call it sacrilege. Is the picture of a young boy nude, and in the arms of an older man art ? Or is it a sexual crime ? You ask 100 people you are going to get 100 answers, mostly all different.    My personal reasons for art follows, hope they help.  1. Man is a creature capable of transcending his brutish nature, art reminds me of this.  2. My soul needs to be fed as well as my belly.  3. Without art, life itself is a meaningless progression from birth to grave with nothing of value in between.

UQTAN7cgaa	freemasonry is a social fraternity that studies morality through ritual, symbol and allegory to provides its members the instruction necessary so they can make themselves better men, they also provide more charity than any other group on the planet.    you can ignore anyone who says freemasonry is a religion, secret society, satanic, cult, etc... they are either lying or just plain old ignorant.|`|AA10116612	A SERIOUS DISCUSSION?

VKXNWcbGaa	Yes, I have many ways of speaking jibberish.  The first way is was switching the syllables of the word around.  The first syllable of the word is a the end, the second syllable is second to last, the third syllable is third to last, etc.  For example: the word jibberish becomes isherjibb because jib is the first syllable (so goes at the end) er is the second syllable (because it's second from beginning) and ish is first (because it's the last syllable).  Sometimes that does not work with one syllable words though.  Another example is water, which becomes terwa.  Another language I know of is double talk.  In this language you take the first syllable and put a arg or gr.  For example: the word word becomes wadagrid, and jiberish becomes jaragib-aragr-aragish.  This form of language is much harder to master and! explain.  And, another one is most common.  It is pig latin.  You simply take the first letter of the word, put it at the end and put the sound made by ay (the long vowel sound of a).  Example: jiberish becomes ibberishjay.  Note: These forms of languages can be spoken by using any language, not just English An example is French.  If you were speaking pig latin in French the sentence that translates to I speak French (Je parle francais) would be Ajay Arlpay Rancaisay.  Hoped it helped!  Enjoy!

jH8hIB0kaa	Stuttering is often caused when your brain is processing faster than your mouth can respond. Work on this first. Start out speaking slowly with deliberation of thought. This means, think your thought fully first. In your mind, break the sentence down into single words. Then only begin to speak one word at a time until the sentence is finished. You must be deliberate in your approach. Slowly increase your speed of speaking.    After you have mastered this speech issue, use your English dictionary to learn a new word at least three times a day. One word from A, then B, and so forth. Read books just above your level. Every time that you see a word that is foreign to you, look it up in the dictionary. Reading out loud is a must! It takes time. Invest in yourself. Good Luck!|`|JBuNJJbkaa	yes, If you want to improve you're vocabulary, somethin' that really helped me was reading books above "my level". This is a boring technique thats super effective.

b2276382725a0bce8479b4c02cdb38b3aa	I don't know, depending on where they live and their background, it seems like the harder you try the more you get the door slammed in your face. Sometimes its gets tiring when ppl are always putting you down, holding you back, not giving you a chance.     Everyone has that feeling though but i guess it rings truer to blacks (in USA i guess). I for one get tired of people always throwing my race out there (usually in a negative way). But i move on and i don't let it get me paranoid lol.    You know a guy told me i ws only in AP classes because i was black.Another guy told me I was luck to be here (in college) because of affirmative action. When my GPA was  much higher than the average person who goes to this school. I don't know, i guess it just gets old.     But i at the same you have those people who blame everything on everyone else. When they cant get a job because they dropped out of school, or they ask why they get followed around stores when they dress like gang members. Now that should be a no brainer. lol  Hope this answers the question a little.    ~chai|`|GarJq6r4aa	I do?,shoot you know me better than I know myself,,just look at all these questions not including yours and you'll see why some  may have that problem,I mean 70% of the questions about race  are about us.|`|b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	Uh, maybe they resent it when they walk down the street and white people consistently shy away from them in fear.    In the US, racial discrimination (whether perceived or factual) is an issue that goes back numerous generations, has no easy solution and will weigh on the country's physique for the foreseeable future.    I had a black colleague that resented my saying "Boy, it's a nice day."  He assumed that I was calling him "boy".

Just look at Africa, one of the most abundant continents of natural resources and wildlife, and its inhabitants are poor, living in poverty, and fill with government corruption.  Not only that, for the majority of humanity's history, the southern half of Africa is isolated from the rest of the world and the people didn't develop much as a community of people.  Tribal war happen all to often, starvation, no capabilities to farm, people work in the most extreme condition for the most precious resources but is paid in cents.  Europeans come down and kidnap and buy people to be used as slaves in the Americas.  Even after the emancipation proclamation, black face racism, harassment, and hatred.  They lost they greatest leader. Today, black people in the America is the butt of society, a lot of them live in the ghettos, poor education, low income, black on black violence, bigotry, discrimination, gangs, hip-hop, etc. and they still can't get themselves out of this situation.  Some people victimize them, say it's their fault.

Maybe printing out a photo of you two and giving to her in a frame... maybe you could buy her that gift, and add a personal touch of your own too( :    good luck|`|ZqhaMRFqaa	yes they do|`|CcIasKaRaa	NO they do animal testing|`|Q8etYn60aa	Yes, and that scent is delicious!  I have it!|`|dvevk1qbaa	no its so generic to get a gift from bath and body. it very...i didnt think of you at all I went for the same gist everyone gives, straight from the mall.    Why dont you take her to a spa for the day...do a spa day. You can go cheap and just let her get  a massage for like 45 bucks    *****more thought********** if you want to give her a basket MAKE YOUR OWN, seriously. Go get a basket from pier 1 or target, put in things she really likes...maybe a robe, a scrubber, a rubber ducky (to be cute), a magazine she might like, with some soaps and lotions fromn anywhere ( even bath and body)...also some nail polish and chocolates.    BE CREATIVE|`|BX02pF4Maa	Nope. A no cost gift made personally, even just a drawn picture means more.|`|saIIuPOhaa	That actually would be really nice! Every mother loves bath & body works. Atleast my mom does! (:|`|4Ums35n8aa	black amethest smells amazing! and yes it would make a good gift!|`|r0UXKUFBaa	yes|`|b614a5b362e42cf7e086de46d1f1d7c2aa	yes, very nice ... everyone can use body products, especially mom. my favorite scent from bath and body works is warm vanilla sugar. i also liked the one you picked out--black amethyst. victoria's secret also has some nice gift sets that you can pamper her with.|`|q4lAOD6Zaa	Oh definitely!!! You can be very creative and make a pamper basket, pick sum nice hand/feet products, a soothing bath scent, etc.|`|2LCB2a43aa	OF COURSE women love that stuff lotion is the best...you can never go wrong with candles either...i recommend citrus scents and warm Vanilla|`|ZHhXQ0ebaa	ya that would be awesome. but may i recomend the cheery blossom or brown sugar fraguances.. they both smell wonderful.. i love them.. lol|`|J6OIYcIiaa	No. Thats an over-used and cliched gift.  I would be disappointed in myself if i got my mom something like that.  Thats what every mom gets for mothers day.|`|M3r1s6oYaa	YES!!!! yes they can they have a perfect mothers day gift. maybe not the one on the website but ortherwise yeah......|`|kB7pHahLaa	I would get flowers and a set of bath stuff! Body wash, lotion, bubble bath stuff, shower stones, shampoo conditioner, etc. and a beatiful rose or tulip and a candle. then she can relax and its not expensive!    hope i helped ya!  hannah|`|RBCfTM9vaa	That is a beautiful thought and Gift.  Mom will LOVE  it.  The only suggestion I have is that you check out the scent prior to purchasing online to make sure it is something within her taste.  Some of the bath and body works items are delectable and some don't mix with everyone's chemistry.....In a nutshell  This is most darling of you.|`|UlxEqoi5aa	my mom liked it|`|5I954vvtaa	Well I got my mother a lotion basket and she LOVED it she still uses it tell this day and she always comments on my choice so I think it is a GREAT gift to give to your mother or who ever but I'd watch out for the lipsticks and or the chap stickss because they can sometimes get a lil bit price-e and you don't want to spend money on something you don't have to because I bet your mom or who ever your getting this gift for has alot of lipstick orchap stickk so Just by lotion orPerfume or soap or hand sanitizer because my mom loved it when I gave her the gift|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	yes love that stuff|`|yV8fog7Paa	she would love that!!!  you can buy the same thing at wal-mart for $10 lol|`|a9TLbyqKaa	yeah it will make her fell pampered|`|oCG2JxsEaa	YES. i love bath and bodyworks!
LQQAQDkIaa	Give flowers to the grieving family for the funeral. We don't usually give money, unless they need help paying for the funereal expenses. Pax Christi|`|4FgrnMZCaa	It really depends, some Korean Families as well as others are true to their heritage and are not that Americanized.  It would always be a true blessing to help with anything you can for the family, or a simple gesture of kindness or gratitude.  If it has to be money then pool together with others you know as a joint gift for the dearly departed.
dXi5trQEaa	If its your sweet sixteen wear a rock and roll electric blue dress with white converse nee lengh.IF not were nee high conver over skinny jeans and a vintage top with a nice jaket!|`|btoBqPOxaa	I would wear a nice light blue tux with a white button up under.

TwfyliKiaa	John 8 . What your pastor is doing is WRONG. Jesus knew the sins of all those people and did not call anyone out on them. Jesus said He did not come to judge, He could,but chooses not to. Luke 6:37-42  Matthew18:21-35|`|dbw210qqaa	Take this as an opportunity to get closer to Christ|`|sW6lxVFOaa	Time to leave while yo are in a moment of clarity.|`|d2c88feb0368d8e6a908ca2052ae52acaa	Time to realize that this minister is not playing with a full deck. I used to go to a Baptist church. My sister and I went to the School there. What a nightmare! My Grandma had Arthritis in her back and legs, and they told my sister and I that our Grandma had a demon in her, which was a lie.    They also brought up people who called out sins, which is bogus, who gave him the right to point out other peoples sins. He is a sinner as well.  This is Gods job to point out sins. The last straw with my parents was when they predicted that Jesus was coming on September 6,1976, and that the world was going to end. That day came and went. After that we left the church to go back to the Lutheran Church.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	You don't have to say anything other than that it was just time for you to leave and move on so that you could grow in the Lord and you have.  What was going on in your old church is not biblical and way out of line.  You did the right thing by leaving.|`|97oxJ0B8aa	Sounds like you're in a cult.  Get out while you can.  But hold on to Jesus.  Lose the crazys but don't lose Christ.  Then again, pray hard about it, maybe the guy is right somehow.  I'd almost have to meet him in person to know.|`|diQ0oodqaa	I went thru something very similar a few years ago, he was the best pastor and then he changed. I tried and tried to hang in there, and prayed and prayed for God to show me what to do. He did finally and i left the church that day and didn't go back to that one again. He lost the church sometime later, is not a pastor now.    I've heard of pastor's who decide to put people's sins in front of them, I think it is awful. He is there to teach God's word, not judge people and shame them, God doesn't want that. I know of a man who did that, he lost his church, never had another one and is an alcoholic now.    As for what I told people after I left that church? I told them I tried hard to stay but God finally showed me it was time to "dust off  my feet" and go on................|`|evStsOQiaa	God told me to tell you to run as fast as you can from that church because the paster is off his meds.|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	You need to find a new church.

As long as you trust in Jesus and love him or whatever you believe in I believe you are fine!|`|QE77Oxtqaa	The seven sins are lust, sloth, gluttony, envy, pride ,wrath, and  greed.    There is nothing concerning liking someone of the same gender.|`|qWPCxYQYaa	First off, liking the same sex isn't even mentioned in the whole "7 deadly sins" thing. In fact, it's only ever mentioned in a few ambiguous, often poorly-translated passages, only one of which even refers to women-on-women love in the first place. There's definitely room for interpretation.    You can't change your orientation, hon. Virtually every major psychiatric association agrees that sexual orientation is natural and unchangeable- it is not a disorder, it is not a mental illness, and it's not something that can be "fixed." If there's a god, then he's a complete jack*** for sending someone to Hell for something that virtually all scientific evidence proves they can't help.    You love whom you love, and there's nothing wrong with that. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.|`|dla31oxDaa	Homosexulality is a sin. When you accept Christ, your saying that your life is now is in his caring hands. Remeber, a false convert DIVES into sin while the true convert FALLS. When you fall into sin it an accident. When you dive its on purpose.
3RQkgTSOaa	I wouldn't classify this as SEXY per se but it was kind of romantic: I took us on a week's vacation to DisneyWorld for his 40th birthday. Neither of us had ever been. We stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge with a savannah view room. We got to see them feed the animals in the morning. It was awesome.|`|0LKIsD7Oaa	it was a really hot night in the middle of summer, and i had some ice cubes, and i traced them along his body. he was blindfolded.|`|oDdXpghDaa	I dunno about sexiest, but romantic... I baked him cookies when he wasn't feeling well and walked them over during a blizzard...  That really impressed him - and I couldn't believe I did it...|`|92rtaXCOaa	have sex with him|`|2UUcuhHZaa	hi, bend over and smiled then after we showered gave him head all night long mboy was it good ,
COFPXYvZaa	he actually WAS asked to resign, by both members of the gay community and the general population. the issue is not that he had the affair with the 18-year-old. the issue is that he had denied having an affair during his campaign for mayor, and had asked the then-18-year-old to lie as well. I don't have a problem with him being gay or the affair, but I have a problem with him being dishonest in the first place.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	So let me get this straight... the mayor of Portland was expected to remain celibate? Why can't he date another adult?  It's not an "affair" unless one of them was married. They were simply seeing each other.|`|3RQkgTSOaa	Not cool. It perpetuates the myth that we prey on younger men and "coerce them into a lifestyle of sin and immorality." Granted, I'm sure he was flattered that a young man would be interested in him and I'm sure the young man was a bit star-struck that such a powerful man would want him. It still doesn't represent our community in a good light. Yes, I will concede if the young man was 18 then it was all legal and he's an adult and free to do as he pleases. The fact that the mayor LIED about it (and tacitly gives credence to the belief that the gay lifestyle is something to be ashamed of) is unfortunate and makes us look bad.    Dont' get me wrong: I'm not opposed to April-September relationships. I'm sure there are many people who have made such relationships work. But when you accept a public office, there are just certain limits one shouldn't breach unless one really wants to pay the consequences. This country does NOT particularly approve of April-September romances, let along a GAY one at that. He should have known better and kept it in his pants until he was out of office and a private citizen again IMO.|`|0LKIsD7Oaa	well, its legal. beyond that im not sure. but looking at it from the 18 year olds perspective, i can see the attraction to power|`|Dkylapi6aa	Well if he is openly gay and wasn't in a relationship already then I don't think it matters. The boy is 18 so its so whatever. But if he was in a relationship then having an affair with the boy is distasteful on his part. Overall its nothing to get hyped up about. It's not like he commited murder|`|aaQUMXUzaa	if it's legal, it makes no difference what I think about it.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I'm really surprised that he wasn't asked to resign. Or that he didn't  choose to. It is a scandal, enhanced by the media of course. But in  liew of the nature of this scandal, I feel it puts a smear on the office  he represents. It's not only this sort of scandal, but any. If any city  leader gets his hand caught in the wringer, he should take his lumps  and step down. And not continue staying in his office as a disgrace.  If you are going to run for any political office, you have to have a  clean past. As the media is going to find out whatever it is, when they  go searching for dirt. Of course, it doesn't help if the person you got  caught with, speaks to the media also and makes matters worse.|`|lBtcFqpJaa	That's hot.|`|oSsVEXMxaa	Well, since the 18 year old is past the age of consent it isn't reasonable to make the statutory rape argument...but having sex with an intern is, in my opinion, is a little skeevy considering the power dynamics.    Regardless, if nothing about what he did is illegal, I don't see what his sex life has to do with his competence as a mayor. He has every right to remain in office.|`|nZ9nqXteaa	I'm not surprized, my thoughts are how long has the relationship been in place, if it started before the young man was 18 I think it perpetuates the idea that gays prey on the young sexually.
xXMLwwyraa	Maybe you mean MiraBAI?  I found this wiki article -  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirabai  Mira was born in 1498 A.D. in Kudki, a little village near Merta, Rajasthan, which is presently in Pali district. Her father was Ratan Singh, a descendant of Rao Rathor, the founder of Jodhpur. When Mirabai was only 3 years old, a wandering sadhu came to her familys home and gave a doll of Krishna to her father. Her father took this is as a special blessing, but was initially unwilling to give it to his daughter, because he felt she would not appreciate it. However Mira had, at first sight, become deeply enamoured with this doll. She refused to eat until the doll was given to her. To Mira, this figure of Krishna embodied his living presence. She resolved to make Krishna her lifelong friend, lover, and husband. Throughout her turbulent life she never wavered from her youthful commitment.  On one occasion when Mira was still young she saw a wedding procession going down the street. Turning to her mother she asked in innocence, Who will be my husband? Her mother replied, half in jest, half in seriousness. You already have your husband, Sri Krishna. Miras mother was supportive of her daughters blossoming religious tendencies, but she passed away when she was only young.  At an early age Miras father arranged for her to be married to Prince Bhoj Raj, who was the eldest son of Rana Sanga of Chittor. They were an influential Hindu family and the marriage significantly elevated Miras social position. However Mira was not enamoured of the luxuries of the palace. She served her husband dutifully(Folklore suggest she didn't do so and even refused to accept Prince as her husband), but in the evening she would spend her time in devotion and singing to her beloved Sri Krishna. While singing devotional bhajans, she would frequently lose awareness of the world, entering into states of ecstasy and trance.

Jei1mTEtaa	its difficult to speak for all japanese, but in general japanese find black people very interesting.    for example, there is a popular television personality called bobby oregon who is black, but he is made to seem like a bumbling idiot and a buffoon. but he is very lovable and he is invited to appear on many tv shows.  also another black person who has recently become extremely popular in japan is jero, who is 3/4 african-american and 1/4 japanese. he sings enka, a traditional form of japanese music, and he dresses like an l.a gangster which japanese find very interesting.    so in general, black people are very liked. however that is merely in the entertainment industry. there was an african man living in my town in japan where i come from, and he found it very difficult to make friends because most people assumed he didnt speak japanese and was just hired as cheap labour.|`|wqgBi10Gaa	Skin color and race are extremely important to Asians in general because social rank matters to them a great deal.  Some people will say that this is true of all people, not just Asians.    My experience in India, Sri lanka and Malaysia tells me this:  If you're from the US, your experience may not prepare you for the Asian version of that concern.    Asians generally view blacks as inferior in many ways.  If you go to Japan, you may encounter all reactions from curiosity, politeness, fascination, to racism and being snubbed and rejection.    It sounds like you could have an interest in having a serious relationship possibly with an Asian guy.  Even if this guy is willing, please be careful.  Some Asians see western women and especially black women as a source of easy sex because of the videos and movies they see and the stories they hear.  Even if the guy goes so far as to propose marriage, his family and community will likely have serious objections - and that's a big deal to Asians because family and community have profound influence in their everyday choices.    THere are a number of groups online that talk about Asian black relationships.  Seems the caribbean has the least (but not zero!) friction between the communities.  The US tempts people with the illusion.  In Asia, there's no confusion, the boundaries are more clear cut.    Hope this helps.|`|GahpE5U2aa	o_o    Erm... well, short answer would be no, they don't. ._.    Racism generally is rabid in Japan. They're extremely ethno-centric and have extremely tight immigration policies.    They seem to like the idea of white people though and have plenty of skin-lightening products available. Plus there are plenty of surgical operations available for young teen girls (from ears to eyelids) to make them look more white. o.0    But, as with any country, this is a generalisation of course. But I don't want to mislead you here. There are black Japanese people, but ethnic minorities are just that - minorities. Japanese are also generally very suspicious of foreigners. And this includes all foreigners.    Immigrating to Japan is not an easy thing to do for anyone. Just make sure to think it through. :/    But if you really want to move to Japan you should go for it.

Even being in the military where we are segregated into dorms with only women I still had no desire for a female.|`|n49i9t6paa	HEEEEEELLLL to the NO    Oooh, I see...your a guy? no wonder....I thought you were a girl    I knew you were a girl...ha|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Someone's been fantasizing way too much.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	ah lankan moor dun judge!  ...but I have to say...not what Muslims should be doing, moonlight..    I've had crushes on my BFFLs cuz their awesome, okie?  but I think it's actually called admiration..not actually a crush...  but then that's what a "girl crush" is...it's admiration for another girl  haha...I used to read too much trendy chick lit when i was younger  >.    boy crushes happen too...it's when they have high admiration and respect for another guy...    but what makes them "crushes" and not just respect/admiration is that they usually admire the person's looks in addition to character  and I rollz w/pretty people, so naturally it'll happen  lol    Allah(swt) knows best|`|LAt9HqC5aa	Woah.    To sum it up: no!!!    I respect and love my close friends because they are amazing people.

I'm not gonna lie, once when I was in a drunkin state I made out with a girl. But believe me I know it's ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.    People relax, I'm straight. I have a husband, not a wife. It was a long time ago. We were at a party at it seemed like a fun thing to do, you know everyone was chanting "do it, do it". I'm actually really grossed out by lesbo's.    Lankoor: Just for the record I did it once. And I only got drunk once. And Allah is our only judge, now I'm very conservative. Nowadays, I'm a much better Muslimah.    LOL your really getting worked up over this, thank God you won't be the one judging me when my time comes. Allah will recognize that I erred in the past and now pray 5 times a day, fast, give zakat, read Qur'an, help people who need help, and so on.     Relax buddy and get a life. Seriously.    Wuzgud: It's hard to find people who understand that it's ok to make mistakes, just as long as you self correct.|`|7fc862488fd8bbc01863aaa40926effdaa	Hell to the mother effing NO.|`|1iKZaaNgaa	Uhhh......  no!|`|okiJdlheaa	Only in my mind.|`|bWtp8Zyjaa	No. Honestly, I find g*y people to be awfully disgusting.

pf8OEAG6aa	food for broke people?   Ramen noodles .  uhh idk just buy stuff that goes a long way.  coco puffs.  peanut butter & sugar sandwich.  chicken and rice|`|lBw50ySpaa	Cook 1/3 bag of egg noodles.  Drain and add 1 can of cream of chicken, cream of celery, or cream of mushroom soup.  Also add a can or 2 of chicken.  Warm thoroughly.  Cheap and easy.|`|Xd19d4aqaa	ramen noodles|`|j65rSZ26aa	By broke I'm assuming cheap. When I was living on my own and my ex lost his job we would eat pb& j sandwiches, ramen noodles, eggs, hot dogs, vienna sausages etc. Always buy things on sale and in bulk and freeze. Here's a great meal i think, buy packaged seasoned(like zatarains) rice, cook according to directions, boil some eggs, while the eggs are cooking slice the vienna sausages and put in rice, when eggs are done cooking, peel and slice eggs into the rice. it's delicious and healthy!|`|ORim3Y4Zaa	ramen Noodles|`|YuLAYK4Iaa	A pkg of brown rice & a lb. of red or black beans will provide LOTS complete protein for very little money.  Combine them as a side dish served with eggs, or add some oil & vinegar & a tomato to make a salad.  Brown rice & diced dried fruit are yummy.  Burritos are flour tortillas filled with refried beans & a bit of cheese.  Quesadillas are just 2 flour tortillas filled with s small amount of grated cheese (& maybe some canned diced green chiles), then cooked on griddle or in microwave.    Avoid the "convenience" foods, as they are filled with chemicals & nasty fat.  Ramen noodles are awful for you.    I've added links to some of my recipes below.

I just think it's a lot of unnecessary stress.    Life is a lot better when you just focus on the good stuff.|`|B9pMjUXraa	Its a negative human emotion thats why its problem and love is a positive human emotion so you really cant compare the two like its the same thing!!!!|`|QFEbDUTAaa	i dont think there is anything wrong with hating someone as long as you dont take it too far... and yes to me it is just another part that makes us human. so live with it get a better of it dont let it blind you|`|ugIf5TJKaa	it's such a definite and extreme word just as love. both shouldn't be used lightly. when you hate something or love something it is 100 percent.

When I am with my current BF, I never feel like I'm sinning.. in fact, it feels like everything in the universe is perfect.|`|MNw4ejFbaa	do what ever u want , don't let other people tell u how to run u'r life with this site|`|cX3yqEtVaa	First, your sexual orientation is never who you "are". It is in his word that God does not want man to sleep with man and woman to sleep with woman.  Just as he says not to lie steal cheat etc.  God doesn't make people liars, nor cheaters, nor theifs, nor Gay.  It is sin that makes us those things.  Jesus is the healer of sin.  That is why he was sent to die for us.  God loves you if you are Gay, just as if you were a theif.. but he doesn't want you to live that way.  He wants you to give your life to Jesus and let Jesus heal you.  Healing may be a long process.. but as long as you have complete faith, Jesus can heal you.  The first step is accepting that God does not like your homosexuallity, even this world is starting to embrace it.

But roughly...    Je sort > dans le sable  Nous faisons des coeurs avec nos mains  comme les pices de puzzle en argile  Nous moule de forme, et puis nous sommes    Unfortunately you can't translate exactly and still have it make sense or sound good in french but i tried. Roughly:    I spell "love" in the sand  We make hearts with our hands  like puzzle pieces made of clay  We mold to fit, and then we stay/are    make sure to have someone help you with pronunciation!|`|zfm51Rpyaa	i dont know french much but i know you can go to www.freetranslation.com and you can type in any english sentence and translate it into french for free! just change the setting in the scroll bar to "english to french" or "english to francis" whatever it says.

They don't exist...?       So yes.|`|5aI77YF8aa	umm... werewolves do not exist... hate to burst your bubble dude... =)|`|oTwymgpIaa	Have you seen your friend change from a human to a werewolf? If you haven't, I'd be questioning whether or not he is blowing smoke up your @ss. In the rarest of events that werewolves were real, women probably would have less of a survival rate considering the male species is much more physically dominate. I think you are just a tad bit gullible. I'd also like to add that when you put the word wolf in your name most people assume you are gay, because a lot of gay men use this name so other gays can identify them. Are you sure your friend isn't trying to tell you he is gay, that might be why he doesn't like to talk about it? I hope your friend isn't an adult preying upon a minor. ;-)|`|BvY47ts6aa	Not that there are not that many women werewolves but actually there is none. Grammatically speaking, werewolves generally refer to males just as when you say wolf you generally think it is a male wolf. Female wolves are called she-wolves, so female werewolves should be referred to as were-she-wolves.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	never watched ginger snaps then.    ginger is so hot|`|ceb16f840e65f504a04160992a9e8736aa	Well it's true.  There are actually no women werewolves because a werewolf is a fictional character, and you are being quite silly I think.  I mean, do you have any evidence that he's a werewolf?  Somehow I'm betting the answer is no.

Have you honesty ever heard of anyone over doseing on weed?|`|RJghPceKaa	yeah even though crack makes you rape people and stuff|`|T3Tpgz5Vaa	Why are you looking for its acceptance?    Either way, like alcohol, its a sad way to find relief, its also a mind altering drug.    The risks of alcohol involve too much consumption over in a short period    The risk of weed involves long term usage, that damages the lungs.|`|lipnPjGxaa	I think people who are against it don't know anything about it, and they say because it's illegal or they make up answers because they're never done it and don't know what it does. I personally don't do it because I don't want my toddler around it, but I have nothing against people who do it. For most people, it just makes you hungry and giggly, what's wrong with that?|`|AA11304279	You know I totally agree with you there is nothing wrong with weed except that its illegal and it shouldn't be in my opion. Weed is a natural drug as we call it but its a natural plant that god has chosen to have grow on earth. So why is it so bad. Its not. Think of all the things we do take into our body that we as man make and mix together and noone makes a big thing about it. Cigarettes for an example is one of them and they are legal go figure. Doctors even prescribe weed to those that are chronically ill and nobody thinks twice about saying that but if someone does it for leisure oh my its bad. So thats my point on it and i totally don't see anything wrong with something god has chosen as a plant to crop on this earth.|`|3cLA6wCWaa	Who cares what everyone is against.  Do what you must.  But there is use and then there is abuse.  This is true with anything.    I was always partial to the harder drugs or even the mind altering hallucinogenics (drug free for life now).

I've met more people from work and school that have smoked weed than I have that don't. And its not like people are going around town saying "smoking weed is bad." Maybe saying that its illegal won't satisfy you but the only answer I hear from weed users regarding why its not bad, is that "its all natural."  So I think both sides need to come up with better reasons.|`|FB28L6D5aa	There is nothing wrong with weed in moderation.. A lot of sheep think it's bad because the government is trying to portray all drugs as something to be scared of, all that "say no" stuff. When honestly, the stuff makes you feel good, it's just a temporary high and it's not harmful if you aren't completely stupid
S1jxvrRWaa	Well I think you will be waiting a long time for a 'rich' person to answer your question.  Personally I think people that are rich live in a reality that is different from us 'common' people.  They don't ever have to worry about paying bills or coming up short on money between pay days.  As far as attitude towards common people, my opinion would be that yea, some of them are that way.|`|a3j82sBpaa	I don't think rich people are looking.

AA10025824	My mother took some pictures of a house she wanted to buy in Florida and a clear image of my father, who died 2 year before, showed up on one of the pictures.  It was a new camera and she was with the realtor checking out the house for the firs time.|`|8k6kxOh2aa	i have come down stairs before at my house, and i saw a lady standing by a window in a victorian like dress. she seemed to be waiting for someone.   i have also seen a child spirit(which is also a poltergeist) it likes to play around sometimes by knocking things off counters. it used to make noises and my mom would run around the house trying to figure out where the noises came from. this would typically occur when she was the only one at home. the poltergeist also likes to wake my friends up when they stay the night by calling their names. it's kinda funny when you think about it, but it really scares them. this poltergeist gets real close to me at times, and it is very cold when it touches you.    ~stardriven09  (i've got more experiences. msg me for more.)|`|w4MF49uiaa	When I was younger I decided to play with a Ouija Board; it was homemade and was fun, at first. I played it alone on the closet floor of my bedroom with a flashlight as my light source.    Before now I would have to occasional dj vu and occasional 'feelings' but nothing other then that.     Nothing immediately occurred and I was disappointing, in fact, I even went to bed grumbling about the stupidity of the Ouija Board. I didn't get much sleep that night. I kept on hearing the hangers in the closet clattering together and the wood front the door 'breathing' - it sounded like someone was leaning against it, then pressing off.    This went on for about a week, I would hear things all through out the night, by morning they were gone.    About a month after the occurrence I finally got up and stormed the closet, only to find that nothing was there, out of place, or in any way out of order.    The only thing I did find peculiar was that the large piece of pink construction board that I makeshift into a Ouija Board wasn't where I left it. It was gone. To this day I still don't know where it went, I suspect hat my mom moved it.    It wasn't until two and a half months later that things really started getting creepy. While I was in bed, laying still and listening to music, I felt someone watching me.    When I opened my eyes I saw some sort of creature crouching on top of my bookshelf. I would have thought he was a man, but he had some sort of weird overly fluffed coat on that looked like fur.    I didn't know how to react, so I turned on the lights. It was gone.    The next day I encountered a totally different 'spirit' (I say this tentatively because I still don't know what they are.) When I got out of the shower, I saw a very tall person standing just in front of my closed (and obviously locked) window. It was dark, but from his silhouette it looked like he was wearing a trench coat. I turned on the lights and he was gone.    Over the years I've encountered a few others, but not nearly as often as these two. Whenever they're around, I now get headaches or suddenly become rather sick to the stomach. Every now and again, I can hear the hangers in my closet rattle, but only on the nights I don't sense the two of my regular visitors.
73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	The best thing you can do to help your spelling is read more. If you come across a word you don't know look it up. Go back to the old ways and choose about 20 words and write them out 10 times each and then test yourself. Write each one in a sentence. For some reason if you write the words down it sticks in your brain more than just spelling it out loud. Spelling is really just practice and the more you read the more you see words and they stick in your brain more so that spelling them becomes second nature. Good for you for trying to improve yourself but unfortunately you will have to put in the work to spell better. Luckily reading is fun and you can choose which books you like.

I mean really - What's wrong with being a little weird - that's just the little differences that make us interesting. Think how boring life would be if everyone was just the same...    A very wise friend of mine once said, 'I dont worry about what other people think. -Nobody- is "Normal"; Normal  is just a setting on the machines at the laundromat.'

If it's something like, 'we need God so that we can get into heaven' (which is, face it, the main argument for Christianity and probably a few other religions as well), then this is still saying that God requires worship for some reason. Otherwise, if we didn't have to worship God to get into heaven, then people don't necessarily have to.  I understand WANTING to, but making it a requirement to get into heaven is saying that God requires worship.    Of course in certain religions (namely Christianity) God demands it; this is not the question she asked.  Demanding is requiring, she asked WHY.

zWy5zOhyaa	Most of the answers are really misleading. India has a lot of offerings and it really depends on what you want to see. Are you interested in history, temples, countryside, beaches etc. I would suggest that talk to a travel agent and go on some type of group tour.     India is 3rd world country and you will find poverty and maybe people begging for money because they see you as a foreigner and you will have to deal with that but ignore the statements about suicide bombers.     Stick to the popular destinations like Agra, Goa,  Kerala and big cities like Mumbai, New Delhi etc. Avoid going alone back-packing especially if you are female.     India is a lovely place to visit and you will be taking some risk going there but its not like going to Iraq or Afghanistan in its current state.   I hope you do go and have a wonderful time.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	Do not drink tap water !      .|`|3180e2b368500ca94cbac1a023253d3caa	Don't tell them your foreign, and most of all keep your money safe.If they find you out you have money, get prepared to be ripped.|`|GahpE5U2aa	If you're going on a "spiritual pilgrimage" I guess you'll be travelling around a lot.

I wouldn't have the faintest, so this is a bit of a pointless post. But I would suggest you avoid the larger cities. You can visit but don't stay too long.

Also be prepared for street people's mindset that foreigners are gold mines for begging and price jacking. This includes monks at temples. These are the bad news.    The good news is that the educated Indians are so enjoyable to be around with. They are courteous, welcoming, and kind. They are smart and they have lots of wisdom to learn from. It is a country with lots of people and layers of classes. Your experience there is greatly impacted by who you interact with.    Oh, don't forget to get all kinds of shots before you go there. And, do not drink anything other than bottled drinks and boiled water. Peel fruits yourself with your own knife. You will enjoy really tasty and delicious foods at low price.|`|aeba6e037a143502b35f08cbfbbe27dfaa	don't swim in any of the rivers,only drink bottled water, make sure you have the needed vaccinations, don't walk around looking like a tourist,  don't take a lot of valuables with you,don't touch any of the cows, stay out of the slums,stick to the major hotels, have a passport any thing  other than a U S one.

I guess it's because most White chicks are skinny and stick thin White girls are glorifyed in the media.

I have also noticed that White guys are more picky when it comes to a girl's appearance than other men.|`|YSr8dm5faa	I'm black... 5'2 and 128 (not skinny and not overweight) and I've dated only white guys so far.

M.P: For some reason I never really had the desire to go to a place with an all out restaurant setting (My family loves to go to expensive places.

jard50Yiaa	Here is a site for Orthodox Christians, you may find more answers here...    http://christianforums.com/forumdisplay....|`|N8wutNoLaa	some view water baptism as necessary for salvation, others view it as simply symbolic. to my knowledge, baptism is necessary in orthodoxy.    it is meant to represent repentance. to represent rebirth; the death of the sinful nature and the partaking of the nature of christ.|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	BAPTISM . . . it is a symbolic death and ressurection. You effectively DIE to your old life and come out as a new person to a new life.    It is a PUBLIC declaration of your private personal and preayerful dedication to God of that new life where you now live FOR God and represent Him in all that you do.    THAT is why only mature-minded people can be baptised. Infants and yoing children do not undestand and can not make such a committment.    Yo no comprendo 'orthodox' christians|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	Your question is not clear.    Orthodox do not see it as a symbol, but it actually confers the grace to make the good things happen (sign).  Through it, people actually are reborn and die/resurrect with Christ.    As for their beliefs about why they think this, It is almost synomomouse with Catholic.    http://www.catholic.com/library/Necessit...          Ask for accepting others baptism, some orthodox will require re-baptism.

Z28VbjGYaa	Yes, I totally hate it! For example, if a white guy was being called a white guy, he would be fine with it, but when they get called a "black guy" they get mad. I think that some people do that because they are racist. Racism is illegal in the United States, and some people still do it! I know people who are Asian and Indian. Indian people ARE ASIAN, but they get called indians. then have you ever wondered why they call an asian...asian? That is so racist!

No matter, how many times someone tell me to "stop acting white" I know that I an black just like the person telling me and the way I or anyone act doesn't change your race.|`|AA10533522	yes they are stereotypes, which drives me nuts.  However sometimes you will meat people who don't act like themselves either.  In other words they try to be something they are not to apiece others.      Just act like yourself, then when somebody says something like stop acting like your ..... ignore them for they are ignorant.
TKZAYJokaa	ok, im a deist but i think people who do things like that in public are showing off. Plus i believe God resides in me and all around me therefore going to church is quite unnecessary.

7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	Nope. Although I've heard stories about people meeting someone that could be considered  unusual in many factors and they are left speculating if they are the three Nephites. But speculation is speculation and can't be considered a doctrinal revelation.     On my own speculation, I believe that the three Nephites wherever they are would look oddly like us in appearance, in the fact that they would be wearing modern day clothing and would be going around speaking whatever modern day language that is now being spoken. That would make it really hard to say where they are or who they are. After all the planet is a big place.      Of course this would be like saying has anyone met the Apostle John lately?    Interesting question.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	...no, but that would be beyond awesome.  Still, this may be the cynic in me, but I tend to believe that most of the stories I hear about people meeting the three Nephites are probably just that: stories.  They are out there, and I'm sure they're helping people, but I don't really see them standing around, waiting for someone's car to break down in a snow storm so they can help.  That's...sort of stupid, really, because while that would be useful, it's not their purpose.  They remain on this earth to bring souls to Christ, not to help stranded drivers or whatever.  Wherever they are, I think they're probably teaching people, not performing random acts of kindness (as nice as that would be for those on the receiving end).      ...which only makes me more curious, of course.  How are they teaching?  Are they still serving in the church offices, or are they just out talking to people?  However they're doing it, those must be some amazing lessons.  Can you imagine being taught by someone who has actually spoken with the Savior?  Listening to them must be a lot like listening to the prophet speak.  It would be amazing.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	I have not personally been visited by them; at least to my knowledge.  I wonder sometimes, if I had, and just did not know it.   There was a time on my mission in Korea, where I broke up a crime being committed upon some elderly ladies who were street vendors. Thieves were breaking up their carts full of their wares, and throwing them out into the street.  I pushed the thieves away and suddenly, an unseen force pushed me out of the way of the thieves swinging num chucks at me and pushed me into a bus, to get away.  I never knew what that force was, although my companion told me it was some guy.|`|WyICbuPqaa	No, but I once met a man who is said to have met the three Nephites.  He was the chief of an indian tribe in Ecuador.  He had dreams of young men in suits and ties coming to him to teach him the truth about God.  He also apparently was visited by one or more of the three Nephites.  When the missionaries came, him and his entire tribe were baptized into the church.  He was District president when I met him, although I have heard that he later became Stake President.|`|TzY9vkinaa	nope, I've just heard cool stories of random men who came to help and then left never to be heard from again. Then of course people wonder if they were one of the three nephites or something.  The most recent story I heard was about some lady who was sick, I forget what illness she had, but a man came to her and said that God sent him to give her a blessing, so they got someone in the ward who had the priesthood to help bless her and then the guy left and she was healed.

"winds") were wind gods who were each ascribed a cardinal direction, from which their respective winds came, and were each associated with various seasons and weather conditions. They were sometimes represented as mere gusts of wind, at other times were personified as winged men, and at still other times were depicted as horses kept in the stables of the storm god Aeolus, who provided Odysseus with the Anemoi in the Odyssey. Astraeus, the astrological deity sometimes associated with Aeolus, and Eos, the goddess of the dawn, were the parents of the Anemoi, according to the Greek poet Hesiod.    Of the four chief Anemoi, Boreas was the north wind and bringer of cold winter air, Notus was the south wind and bringer of the storms of late summer and autumn, and Zephyrus was the west wind and bringer of light spring and early summer breezes; Eurus, the east wind, was not associated with any of the three Greek seasons, and is the only one of these four Anemoi not mentioned in Hesiod's Theogony or in the Orphic Hymns. Additionally, four lesser Anemoi were sometimes referenced, representing the northeast, southeast, northwest, and southwest winds.    The deities equivalent to the Anemoi in Roman mythology were the Venti (in Latin, "winds").

Debbie|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	The 'confusion' in God's Word is actually an error in our interpretation of God's Word.    Scripture is true, but not always literal.  Often it has an meaning in parable.  The experience of Hell will be the separation from God.  It will be painful.  It will be like death, but an eternal dying.  Compared to that horror, it is realistic to compare it to a Lake of Fire, death.    Hell is separation from God.  This separation can be experienced as a lake of fire or death.|`|ihSvdnOvaa	The same reason why people are confused on how we got here. Some say God did it, some say nothing did it, and scientists say the talking monkey did it.|`|d9fb2acd20fb4c3590182dc9f4470d89aa	Firstly, the subject is not altogether simple.  There is the fate of the soul, once it leaves this realm, and the fate of sinners is a place of temporary torment called in the Hebrew Sheol; in the Greek, Hades. Some have rendered this word by the English word hell.  The Bible however also teaches that there shall surely be a resurrection of the wicked, where their souls are reunited with resurrected eternal bodies. These wicked will then be cast into what the Bible calls the Lake of Fire, where they will be punished forever for the sins they committed while in the body on earth. The Lake of Fire is sometimes also called hell. This is one source of confusion.    Many today try to deny the existence of eternal punishment.  I believe the basis for this is a total lack of understanding of the degree of sinfulness that mankind has sunk down to. Also the sheer terror of such a possibility causes men to shrink back from even considering there could be such a fate awaiting men. Especially so because they are so thoroughly in love with their sin and so entrenched in their rebellion against God.  The traditional view and the only honest conclusion that one can come to with an honest study and consideration of ALL the Scriptures is that there is indeed a place of never ending punishment for those who reject the free gift of God in Jesus Christ.  "Behold both the goodness and severity of God."|`|UD7d70awaa	Being separated from God that's Hell.|`|gJ8F634Haa	It's Roman mythology mixed with Christianity.

He had to lay down I just found out. You ever ask your parents a question through the door? Jesus's baby is praying right now. She don't want her and the temple of the Lord to look like hell since she and God's dying Thank you, Lord!  Meanwhile Michale's Navy's eating sloppy Joes right now cause there ain't nothing to do till everybody's dead so he's taking his time. He's protecting the bride's body don't you see and her children's bodies as well. He's doing a good job soldiering so far. Jesus, we just praise your Father and hope He can get that other hand to moving. I know He wants His stuff read to Him cause He forgot everything in the grave don't you see? He lost His bible.

Anytime you hear something that differs from what you were taught, you should look it up in the bible and find scripture to back up the words you've heard.  Too often Christians will take the word of their pastor or friends without checking it out in the bible.  This leads to the confusion.    To specifically comment on your example of confusion.  The Hell that Jesus refers to is a darkness and lake of fire where there will be "weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Math 8:12; 13:42, 50; 22:13; 24:51; 25:30; Luke 13:28).  The best description of Hell is given in Jesus' account of Lazarus and the rich man where Lazarus died and was sent to the wrong side of the Gulf where he is tormented by hot flames (Luke 16:19 - 31). Then of course there is the eternal torment of unrepented sinners who are judged after the second ressurection and sent to the lake of fire because their name is not in the book of life (Rev 20:15).    When we are born, we are spiritually separated from God (Rom 5:12).  That is not Hell, but it is not a condition you want to stay.  We should strive to be free from sin and accept Jesus Christ as our savior (Rom8:2).  But you must believe in the correct definition of Jesus: He died on the cross to wipe away your sins, three days later he rose from the dead conquering death so that we all may have eternal life (1 Cor 15:1 - 5).    God Bless!|`|Lc5FtItDaa	Tradition and literature contradict God's word.

Poetic expression accomplishes that which Biblical Hebrew, Aramaic, and various other neighbour-languages whose expressions found their way into the culture of ancient Israel's sopherim and so into the monographs of the Biblical texts.    It is recognised that the use of simile and metaphor creates great difficulties for those who say the Bible is without error.  To take everything written in the Bible at its face value when viewing  poetic imagery as having its superficial literal meaning is a formula for disaster.    Saying that a child has 'apple cheeks,' does not mean that the cheeks are actually made of apples, but the meaning is clear, that the infant has rosy cheeks.    So how could the Israelites describe a place that none of them had seen, but that is known to be a place of grieving, regret, and the mental suffering that accompanies such states.    Hell had to be made unattractive, and to this purpose the Gei Hinnon Valley [Gehenna] in Jerusalem was embraced by some writers as being hell-like.      This is because the dung from the cities' houses and animal shelters was carried out of the Dung Gate and deposited in the valley.  Also, animals that died and were forbidden to be eaten because of the manner of death, were dragged to the same place and set on fire.    It follows that the stench from that place was rank and acrid, and some report that sulphur in the ground also ignited and emitted fumes so poisonous and vile that no man could breathe them for more than a few seconds.    It is, therefore, fitting that Christ would use Gehenna to warn us of the danger of ending up in a place outside the presence of God, because it was a place no one relished visiting.    Some will take one piece of description and regardless of whether it is simile or metaphor, or something else, will grasp its superficial meaning to define what they construe it to mean, often guessing quite wrong, but reluctant to abandon their 'exegesis.'    The confusion comes from Bible readers, and from some theologians, each having insufficient background in the documents that when placed together comprise the Holy Bible.      Reading the Bible in English is not the same as studying the Bible texts in their original languages, having also a sufficient understanding of the people, their times, cultures, languages, disappointments, and triumphs, and so forth.      By this means many of the pettifogging theological niceties that some have erred by believing their chosen gobbet or proof text verses tell them everything there is to know about the complete Bible, and so do not travel beyond their prejudices for better understanding.      It is folly to presume that some parts of the Bible speak to us, but that other parts do not.  All the Bible in all its parts must be understood, or else the whole is a nonsense.    There is no single system of theology in either Old or New Testaments.  There is less agreement between Bible book writers than some would have us believe.  The Bible should be taken for what it is, a source of inspiration, wisdom, history [of a kind], and hope for the future.    It is not inerrant, and neither are its readers, and in some notable cases neither were its writers.    These are the sources of much of the confusions that infuse and surrounding readers of the Bible, and cause others to imagine that the Bible cannot contain one single;e error.

The difference between us is that I try to help others see the light and not try to scare them.    You use the hell-fire argument even though you are not realizing you are using it.  To make this clearer I will repeat your words in a simplified way.    If you don't believe what I believe then Satan is misleading you.    Now I hate to sound harsh, but that is the basis of what you are saying.  Keep in mind the Roman Catholics believe in the trinity.  They are the oldest of the Christians still around today.

Since you are Christian you might understand this; Father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing.

I did use a scare technique and for that I am sorry I normally don't.

Only God will know, but I think we are ahead in numbers.  Roman Catholic religion.|`|ppKsmaEIaa	Christianity is perfect for so many reasons, but I'll tell you the basics.     1) God redeems us to Himself    In many other religions, God is either non-existent, all-powerful and completely indifferent, or not all-powerful. The God of Christianity is all-powerful, all-knowing, and LOVING. My God loves every human beyond what we can imagine, which fits because He is all-powerful.    2) Christianity fits with the world    First of all, Christianity explains suffering quite adequately. Buddha is supposedly peaceful because of his absence of desires, but this does not explain why he puts suffering in the world at all. Islam says that the infidels deserve suffering, but don't explain why they get suffering if they follow Allah. My God causes people to suffer to either grow them in faith in Him, or to challenge them to become believers. I'll talk later about how this fits with His Love.    Secondly, God is all-powerful, so the amazing world we see here today moves and is orderly because God created it to be that way. We have the complex notion of time because of God. We have trillions upon trillions upon trillions of tiny pieces in our bodies that are directed by an all-powerful God to move in exactly the right way to carry out their functions.     Thirdly, Christianity recognizes man's sinful nature. Every man is obviously not thinking about pleasing God 100% of the time. This is why we have a need for a Saviour, which God provided. This Saviour humbled Himself (an example for us to be humble as well), loved and still loves us unconditionally (another example for us to follow), died for us, having no desire to carry out His own desires (another example for us to be selfless), and rose by His own infinite power, which defeated the power of Satan to enslave us to earthly sins and desires (which is where the Holy Spirit and faith come in).    3) Christianity fits with itself    I told you I would explain how suffering fits with God's love, so I will. To a certain extent, God's love is unexplainable to us fallible, sinful men, but I will do my best. We are supposed to love God because of His infinite grace (blessing us with more than we deserve), mercy (not giving us the punishment we do deserve), and power, which is infinite. This threefold love is a way that we can love God without being selfish. If we loved God simply because He treated us well, we would be selfish brats. But we are supposed to love Him because of His power and glory and because He deserves our praise for making us what we are. This way, we can love God even in suffering, making Christianity the greatest religion, because it is true.     I think I've done my best to explain why Christianity fits with itself and with the world we see around us. After all, that is what we are here for, to give our best to God. We are supposed to love each other out of our love for God, and so we spread the good news of our great Saviour throughout the world, hoping that whoever hears it will be made to think and reason through the beauty of this true religion, because that is what it is.|`|9hFexadLaa	because if you're not a Christian you suffer and burn forever in hell, eventually going to a burning lake of sulfur, so ya...|`|89xzNpVaaa	My religion is not the best, but i believe it and respect it and respect all religions.

He is Abba. He is All. the Alpha and the Omega, the rise and fall.

I don't judge others for their beliefs either!|`|xzL2oRq9aa	in Wicca, we don't believe that any ONE religion is the "best" for all, or anyone. We believe that their are many different paths to god, or gods, or higher things, realms.     It all depends on the heart and soul of the person searching for their own path, whatever feels right to them. I mean, i know a friend who is Wiccan, her boyfriend a Buddhist, and there 14 year old daughter a Christian. And they all have each others blessing, because they to know that deity is in every path, Wicca is just one of the many.     Wicca is a nature based religion. NOT evil.

u6K5TtRlaa	Well, when you dig into enough statistics, there're bound to be weird trends. It's not to say that anything's connected; it just means that, when you do a bunch of random sampling, you might just unluckily pull all the left-handed paedophiles into your survey and none of the right-handed ones. When you're conducting a survey that's meant to be extrapolated to a whole population, you're supposed to get a "representative sample" of that population, but that usually pertains more to race, sex, sexuality, socioeconomic stuff, etc. I don't think they usually worry about left or right handedness.    With all the statistics out there, I'm sure lefties and paedophiles aren't the only strangely correlated ones|`|vDG0iA8laa	So...?  Go to Google - do a search for left handed persons, and see how many were famous for achievements, and not as you have indicated..  I hate generalization on things which are complete ca-ca..!!!  Rachelle In High Heels|`|lezn2xG3aa	Just because it may seem that there is a trend between pedophiles and those who are left handed does not mean that ALL pedophiles are left handed or that ALL people who are left handed are pedophiles. Kind of like how most men enjoy action movies. This doesn't mean that all men enjoy them, and it doesn't mean that girls can't enjoy action movies also. It is just a trend. Don't worry about it LOL! I'm sure your a great person and not pedophile =]|`|NnatPbU7aa	Left-handed people are evil. Hitler was left handed, and so was Bill Clinton.|`|VoO9jZdUaa	I wouldn't worry about it.  I'm struggling to get over my battle with pedophilia.  I haven't been active lately (applause), but when I was, I met a few other men with my condition, and we were all right-handed! Overall, to answer your question, there's no connection.  Trust me.|`|9BeUbORtaa	Why is it that you wonder what "possible connection" there could be between paedophilia and left-handedness, but not about the more "flattering" associations?     And then you go and point out that "it wasn't that huge of a difference" anyway. You're just left-handed. It doesn't make you special. It doesn't even make you a paedo.|`|3ee9a82552425841f1df0a2f7477f624aa	haha don't worry about it|`|XadpLGJnaa	omg ****. i have no idea what the connection is. im left handed, and thats just wrong!|`|oY4vwdjVaa	The devil is left handed.      lol

os6FaEBlaa	I never understood that. I've probably had a worse life than 80% of these emo kids. I grew up with my mom in a small house, while she had to worked to make money for food, and she also had to go to college so she could make more, and I had to see after my baby sister. I lived half my life on welfare. I have it better today but not that much. These emo kids don't know how lucky they are.|`|gmaCvh00aa	They do not have enough to do nor exposure to people in the real world who have real problems.|`|lPPgMKibaa	Well, maybe our life does stink. i dont represent all emo people but im depressed.

Everyone feels down sometimes.|`|aRRQrwd9aa	i  have meet a lot of "emo kids"- most of them have more problems then you think.|`|j6IjkPPVaa	They have the luxury of whining about stupid crap and they take what they have for granted.

Just remember to not exchange your Coke, water, grape soda etc.|`|JseyoIfLaa	Nope it's not a sin and I'm not any stranger than anyone else.|`|RyhluHk3aa	I'm gonna say....... that depends on what fluids, in what kind of situation.|`|SC7sxZDMaa	Only if you're exchanging water for Gatorade.  Gatorade is Satan's elixir ,and thus, pure evil in a plastic bottle (AKA Satan's unholy grail).       If you're talking bodily fluids, there's no sin involved (especially if she's really cute).  Just practice safe sex - in other words, don't let her parent's find out, or your wife for that matter.|`|fOKssTulaa	what kinda fluids..lighter fluids?|`|d7xE8bYFaa	Like what?

AA11025703	The most common, Acurate, complaint I seem to find, is that we go out offering to preach about the Bible.  But this is something Jesus himself commanded.    Another, Acurate, complaint I've seen, is that we don't celebrate such things as Christmas.  However, Christmas, is a Pagan holiday, so our not celebrating it makes sense, in my mind.

"... *sigh* You lost him again Loasha?"|`|NWnOTkwCaa	It's because they claim to be Christians but they don't believe what Christians believe -- that is, the doctrines taught by Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Finney, Spurgeon, Jonathan Edwards, Francis Schaeffer, CS Lewis, and Billy Graham.  Also they think "only" JWs are saved and everyone else is doomed.  Also they've given actual dates for the end of the world, and it didn't happen. And yes, many of them are nice people. But they are nice people who are wrong.|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	Yeah, I have heard that reputation too, but recent experiences have changed my mind.      I find them nice, caring, and... inspiring.  I like my visitors even though I strongly disagree with their beliefs.|`|R4RsQxJEaa	I'm not sure what you mean by "against Jehova's Witnesses". Many of them are nice and they do stand up for their beliefs. but like many other religions they are not Christian. They do not believe that Jesus Christ is divine and worthy of our worship. So I would disagree with their beliefs, but can certainly love them as individuals and pray for their salvation.|`|blT9H4wPaa	Im not against a certain religion, IM AGAINST ALL RELIGIONS AND THE ENSLAVEMENT OF THE HUMAN MIND AND BODY THEY BRING.

People think you're just buying it for siblings or cousins, and think you're doing a nice thing (but you're not, because its your lego >_
YTgw2VQjaa	A gift from the heart is sometimes better than a mindless gift no matter how expensive it is.  Try thinking of something she likes to do, somewhere she'd like to go...    Think of something from when you guys dated, something you did a lot, like a certain restaurant you went to, a certain drink you'd have, something you did together that was special and recreate it.  That would really be touching!|`|3oWklIdLaa	Instead of getting her expensive gift. Set up a romantic evening away from home for just the two of you.  Maybe some roses and lingerie to finish off the night.  My husband get gifts from www.cheriescloset.com.  Their lingerie is beautiful and have many other gifts  that would make the night perfect.|`|Yqgc1pHLaa	make her a scrap book with pictures of you two, then leave one last page and put like "hawaii" or "the cruise" something like that then when she's like what?? present her with tickets you bought for that place.    plane tickets are cheap right now!!
z93tSvKxaa	I totally agree. The sad thing is you need a license to hunt, a license to drive and a license even to fish.  However you do not need a license to be a parent.  How sad?    The worst part is not only do bad parenting hurt their own children, but it damages society in general.  Remember bad kids are not born that way, they are made that way.    **By the way the girls are not getting pregnant by themselves. Guys need to get smart, either say no or wear several condoms.  I do not understand why a guy would waste his time with the trashy girls and then discard them when you are tired of them. It is selfish for the guy as well.  If you truly like ladies then be specific about that and not send mixed signals.    The only reason these girls are out spreading themselves around is because they know this is what the "guys" like.  Be honest which girls get the most attention, the quiet, shy, intelligent one, or the one with the loud mouth and $l utty clothing?|`|WYo59zLOaa	I agree these black parents need to stop sitting on their couch and watching their BET while eating their KFC, I keep an eye on their teens that are out there smoking pot and stealing stereos.|`|BY02DhfWaa	alright that is enough, you were once a teen so quit ,i was once a teen so i will tell you a secret i had a baby at 18 and now he is 18 if it were not for girls you would not be here . you know as well as i do the guy can not have s** all buy him self so stop putting all the blame on the girls that's why i keep tabs on my kids because kids do not think with the right parts  of their body when they are in the situation. men are the same as a teen that is part of there life girls do not think about that as much as guys do that just erks the heck out of me when people put the blame on all these girls that are getting pregnant and another thing is a abortion is not the best thing for anyone . why would you even think that there are so many people that can not have kids that want them so badly that's all they think about .what would have happened if your mother got an abortion you would not be here to do  what you are supposed to do here on earth . i believe every one here has a purpose so how could you say that someone does not have the right to be here i am sorry but you don't have that right to decide who stays and who doesn't .i think you need to rethink what you said here i an not trying to be mean i am just giving my opinion .thank you for reading my thoughts i am not saying i am right or wrong just think about what you have read .|`|fEEbx6XTaa	Parents are so irresponsible Some of them provide their kids with drugs, cigarettes, etc.       My parents taught me well so i know better. I will never even think of coming home with a child while living with them. I know my boundaries. IDK what's up with my peers' parents these days. They suck at parenting.|`|da4zS4AOaa	I know parents need to do the job. But some stupid girls are old enough to know what's right and what's wrong. If you have strict parents it helps. If you have parents that treat you like you can have anything in the world you'll most likely fall into that type of behavior|`|CBKjEvp5aa	Well my parents don't watch me too closely, but I'm not a whore, so they don't have much to worry about. I'm still a virgin in fact. But I do love to smoke and drink, and they don't really approve of that. But that's it.|`|n8ovnlt5aa	I'm 11.    I agree with you.|`|O1zVSQSQaa	i'm 18 but i am no where near the teenagers you are describing i think parents are giving up and being too loose on their teens my family raised a good teenage girl with good head on her shoulder my younger high school is flooded with pregnant teens and they are happy i think its very disgusting and unrepresentable and this "epidemic" must be put to an end statistics say teen pregnancy went up 60% i don't believe in abortions but i believe in waiting|`|iAWxuVOsaa	It's both sex's fault, really. I would assume the reason we have so many terrible parents is because most of them have sex at a young age, and eventually have children, then their kids end up following the same path because the parents just don't care. This is only my opinion of course, but I see this scenario happening all too often for it to be a rare occurrence.|`|vj3080wbaa	I AM a 15 year old high school girl with a boyfriend ,time for my 2 best friends mall time and hang out time  and i have a 4.0 gpa and in ski club,on the speech and debate team and on the varsity soccer team o-yeah NEVER HAD AND KIND OF SEXUAL INTERCOARSE NEVER WILL UNTILL MARIGE  and my boyfriend knowss that and respects that ..so stop bashing the american teens we didn,t do no-thing bad ..so....suck it up and deal ..lifes tough get over it already.                                                  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   thats what i say   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|NlWSj3OWaa	u r right. and u r right that people will argue with you.  however lets look at the problem, first of all most these girls don't have daddies who care. moms working hard and has way too much on her plate. moms these days think its better 2 b a friend then a parent(usually its easier 2 give in then fight) the govmnt/schools have taken the art of discipline out of the home, leaving a parent with little choices. Im 50 and i knew if i screwed up my dad had a belt waiting 4 me when i got home-that kept me and my sibs from doing allot we wanted to. when u r in a store and the parent punishes a kid for a fit the parent gets all kinds of remarks about abuse. I used 2 carry a wooden spoon in my purse, being a single mom i wasn't going 2 let my darlings embarrass me in public. my sister had 2 work 2 jobs 2 keep a roof over her kids heads and out of 4 kids only 1 dad paid support. So im thinkin maybe ur real beef is with the parents who think that being a parent is being their friend rather then being a role model and guide.  when my 16 yr old decided she wasnt going 2 take the shots i demanded i took the phone computer and no friends from her. she got the shot but when the next one was due and she refused i sent her to live with her older sister whom was a divorced mom with 4 satins span. Now shes 18 and doesnt want 2 ever have any kids|`|0UjFOsHkaa	I agree with you 100%. I graduated high school in 2004, and some girls had  or 3 kids by graduation and some now have 5! All by different dads. And guess who i supporting their *** and those kids? Us hard working, responsible adults. I really like you're question. I asked a question similar to this about a month ago and had people telling me I'm jealous I'm 22 and still don;t have a kid. I don't have a kid cause I'm RESONSIBLE
6dP60V3zaa	I don't think she's anything yet, just a little too sexual for her age. she must have seen or gotten that from somewhere.|`|T2h6Z6kCaa	Is she attracted to girls? Is she attracted to guys? She may be bisexual but.........................    P.S she's not to young. I knew I was a lesbian when I was 12|`|3ee9a82552425841f1df0a2f7477f624aa	Depends wait a couple more years|`|GVw4WKaQaa	umm. thats a little young >>
NG6eeCfuaa	That people have never really been on the moon. It was all a hoax. Funny that people think that.|`|tACJnpI1aa	The theory that the founding fathers of our nations were all members of the Free Masons and that seal of the United States has Masonic messages hidden in them and that the Free Masons are trying to unite all the people of the world to be under the rule of one supreme government and that the free masons will be the only leaders.|`|aZKgs79Naa	The JFK assassination :)  Very cool, I think.|`|8k6kxOh2aa	the conspiracy theory of area 51 and the conspiracy theory behind abraham lincolns assasination...very interesting really|`|GPCzENwCaa	That elvis is still alive and living among aliens and the Osama Bin Laden is Hitler just with plastic surgery lol|`|XgH9uuv9aa	This: http://sarsen56.wordpress.com/solve-this...|`|FM614SKQaa	that elvis or tupac is still alaive!|`|Z74ZQFRjaa	I think it's a tossup at times.  One is in Russia and the Romanovs, did one of the children (such as Anastasia) actually survive the murder of her family and her family line still alive.  Another is the Templar Treasure.... movies definitely brought that one up more.  And of course JFK and what really happened in Dallas|`|TzodCxhgaa	My favorite conspiracy theory is The Jews. For one, it's the most complex and ambiguous of questions. Jewish history is relatively well-documented in many places and periods and thus it spans across various cultural paradigms: race, religion, politics, economy, popular culture, etc. Chosen People, Christianity, Communism, Liberalism, Mass Media = mind control. It all makes sense, and yet it's so complex that you never know whether you are a stupid, paranoid *** or a reasonable, logical person.
