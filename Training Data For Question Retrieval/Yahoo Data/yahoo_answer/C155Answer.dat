Non so che tipo tu sia caratterialmente ma prova ad essere sempre carina, ad avere un sorriso per tutti. Io sto provando cosi da tipo un mese e vedo che anche le altre persone sono piu aperte verso di me...magari potresti riuscire a cambiare anche te.|`|p1wPEFjHaa	si e' successo molte volte... stai tranquillo perche succede a tutti, di solito ti abbandonano quando credono ( e son convinti) che vali di meno di quanto pensavano valessi davvero! e' gente che da pregiudizi e quindi e' un orgoglio per te se quelle persone ti abbandonano perche' non meritano la tua amicizia|`|TxxAPbZQaa	si guarda capita<br>  esci e fai nuove amicizie<br>  oppure prova a cambiare città|`|3X1AqpPfaa	Io da tre anni  vivo in una città nuova (ancora adesso per me è così) e non ho amici. Ultimamente ho dei conoscenti, che non sottovaluterei perchè sono un terreno motlo fertile per le amicizie: perchè dici che non esci se qualcuno di chiama ? Per paura? E di che?

ByWRzuuraa	I love both.<br>  Amelia is like my faveee name xD<br>  Haha!!<br>  Amelie is cute though :)<br>  xxx|`|6Z6z37o6aa	I like both, but I do prefer Amelie.<br>  <br>  I speak French, and Amelie has always seemed the softer and more youthful of the two to me. Amelia is very elegant, but seems harder and more haughty to my ear. Amelie is also much less popular. My only concern might be that Amelie is also much more likely to be mispronounced; many mistakenly say it the same way as they would Emily. Otherwise, it's absolutely lovely!|`|TrBoPj92aa	They are both really sweet and pretty names that go well with alot of things for middle names however i prefer Amelia over Amelie because although Amelie is softer but  Amelia is angelic and i think it goes with more names <br>  i like :<br>  Amelia Rose<br>  Amelia Grace<br>  Amelia Lucy<br>  Amelia Louise<br>  Ameilia Rochelle <br>  <br>  Well thats my opinion!!!|`|gkKJdu7Kaa	I like them both.

I6waeJRqaa	I can totally relate.  I started feeling the same way at 30 weeks.  It's hard now for me to even sit up  straight bc my belly has gotten so  big.  My lil one does  seem to have his own.  He sleeps during the night and up until I go home from work at 1200 am.  I just hope he sleeps in that routine when he gets here.  Good Luck with everything and I hope you feel better.  Not much longer!!|`|7DF3qLDraa	Your baby grows extremely fast at this stage so just try and make yourself as comfortable as possible!! I was so excited to meet my son because I felt like I already knew him. I told people all the time that he already had a great personality. Make sure you talk to the baby and sing to it... I had my husband read my son books while I was still pregnant with him and those same books comfort him now when he is upset. Good luck with everything.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	If you are saying you are uncomfortable while sleeping I will give you a few pointers, first of all, Put a pillow underneath your belly and the bed and in between your knees. this takes a little bit of the weight and pressure off to make you a little bit more comfortable.Also you could try wearing one of those belly bands i heard they take a lot of the pulling pressure off of you while you do whatever. Try these things and see if it helps you are almost there, so its about that time when you start getting a lil bit uncomfortable. Good luck you are almost there!!|`|XhJL7tnwaa	I don't see a question here really.<br>  <br>  I understand what you mean about being uncomfortable now. I'm 31w4d pregnant with my fifth child and it is now becoming harder to find a good sleep position and to get to sleep (and stay asleep). <br>  <br>  Using a pillow between your legs/under your tummy, and a pillow behind your back can help discomfort. (I really loved using body pillows for pregnancy.)<br>  <br>  My daughter has a routine also, and it is wonderful to feel her moving about her day.
XhJL7tnwaa	PCOS has nothing to do with generating hCG, so your results on a hpt will be the same as everyone else's. If you are taking a medication to treat your PCOS that contains hCG then pregnancy tests can be affected.|`|AA10305611	I have pcos and showed a positive on a preg test without any problems. It turned out to be a early miscarraige tho. Pcos usually won't interfere with the pregnancy test, but it can interfere with your hormones which help you hold a pregnancy( I miscarried due to low hormone levels) or some pcos women have a hard time getting pregnant.
kCiizn5oaa	I knew it was Keira before I even saw the whole question. It's a beautiful Irish name and you should be proud of it. I would absolutely love to be called Ciara! Lucky You!|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	No so much. Because before I even opened this I saw See air uh. Not Keira.|`|TrBoPj92aa	yeah i really like its really sweet and flows with alot of things, its elegant and pretty ! great name!|`|by8jh0Lmaa	I think the way you spell it looks like "See-air-a", not "Keera"|`|0LUBf2Juaa	No|`|7Dpz81d5aa	Ya.....it's pretty.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :-)|`|MddCJT5paa	nah its too common|`|776cf4cc9dc31fae3b35bd08e9ead34eaa	Doesnt add up with the pronounciation. why not just kiera?|`|P2xX8xMcaa	I am sure it is the only name that will suit you, so don't think about changing it.  I have a friend named Virginie...like Virgin with an e at the end.  Even with all the flack she gets, her name is who she is...so be proud of it.|`|ByWRzuuraa	I love it so much.<br>  Ciara is a gorgeous name, adorable.<br>  I'd do anything to have a name like that lol.<br>  xxxxxxx|`|KAj7GfeDaa	I think anyone reading this name will pronounce it like- Sierra.<br>  It's a pretty name, but if you want it pronounced like Keira, then you should maybe do -Kiara. I like that spelling better- less confusion.|`|0hNGStuOaa	I like Sierra, Sienna, Ceira and Keira and Ciara(ceeaira) but not like your name(No offense)|`|7R9NSTx5aa	I really like it, I find it very beautiful.

It's such a shame.<br>  I really like the masculine, Ciarán. Very handsome.|`|okgr5aPCaa	I love the name completely :)|`|1cYPOJkqaa	Grr... It's a beautiful name. I know a few, and for some reason they're all natural blonds. Kinda random. <br>  <br>  Anyway, it's an Irish name and the Irish (original) pronunciation is KEER-uh. So stick with it. You're saying it the right way, so don't worry.|`|Vv465eJMaa	Tacky.It means a life for the person with that name of having their name constantly spelt wrong and pronounced wrong.It will irritate her all her life.|`|u7UnUZXnaa	i think that its spelled like it should be pronounced SEE-AIR-UH. but i love the name Keira. and i like the name Sierra.|`|LIVkGLa5aa	mmmmm
fZGcufB7aa	Addison Caroline- I love this name. It seems to flow so well. I think Addison is such a gorgeous name. This is my second favorite name on your list. 10/10.<br>  <br>  Evelyn Faith- I love this name too. You don't hear the name Evelyn that much anymore so I really like it. Faith is a great middle name for Evelyn. This is my third favorite off of your list. 9/10.<br>  <br>  Adeline Lucille- I love the name Adeline, but I don't love the middle name Lucille with it. I think it's because there are too many L's in the name. It's still cute though. This is my fourth favorite. 7/10. <br>  <br>  Lucie Elizabeth- I have never liked the name Lucie for some reason. It just seems too old to me. I love Elizabeth though. Maybe you could use Elizabeth as a first name. Or you might like the name Lacy. This is my least favorite on your list. 4/10.<br>  <br>  Eden Savannah- It's cute. I love both names a lot, just not with each other. Maybe you would like Eden Lucille or Savannah Brielle. This is my fifth favorite off of your list. 7/10. <br>  <br>  Maddison Bailey- This is my favorite. I love the name Maddison and Bailey is such a cute middle name. I once saw on here that you liked Maddison Riley. I kinda like that even better. 10/10.<br>  <br>  I love your naming style. Great nams.|`|Z6NlNRLoaa	My Ranking:<br>  1. Evelyn Faith<br>  2. Addison Caroline<br>  3. Adeline Lucille<br>  4.Lucie Elizabeth<br>  5. Eden Savannah<br>  6. Maddison Bailey<br>  (Basically the order you already had them in)|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	I like Evelyn Faith a lot.<br>  2nd I like Adeline Lucille.<br>  3rd - Addison Caroline<br>  <br>  The least favorite is Maddison Bailey|`|ewDKMeJkaa	Adeline Lucille is my fave<br>  <br>  Eden Savannah least fave|`|igvUbqkyaa	I love old-fashioned names!<br>  <br>  I absolutely LOVE the name Elizabeth (although I do prefer the spelling Elisabeth) but both are gorgeous!!! I also really like Caroline!! Evelyn is nice but I especially love the nickname Evie! Adeline is also pretty but I am not keen on the nickname Addie which will most likely be given to her. Eden is also okay but I love the nickname Edie. <br>  <br>  I don't care for Addison, Fath, Lucille, Lucie, Savannah, Madison, or Bailey. So I guess my favorite of your combinations is Evelyn Faith, followed by Adeline Lucille, followed by Eden Savannah. And my least favorite is definitely Maddison Bailey.|`|LRsd01Dtaa	Addison Caroline  - I like Caroline but the Addison is too much and a last name. <br>  <br>  Evelyn Faith - Nice...strong, yet feminine. <br>  Adeline Lucille - Hmm...try switching for smoother roll - Lucille Adeline<br>  Lucie Elizabeth - Love Elizabeth, not too chummie with Lucie<br>  Eden Savannah - Nice but try switching them Savannah Eden<br>  Maddison Bailey - Please don't give her two last names for a first and middle name...also very long. Maddison...do you like the nicname "Maddie"? Must consider...<br>  <br>  ~J~|`|tWKZVDG2aa	I love Evelyn Faith.  Evelyn can be shortened to Evy or Evie which are really cute names too.<br>  I love Adeline as well.  Although I am not as keen on Lucille.  What about Adeline Cecily or Adeline Freya?<br>  <br>  I don't particularly like Maddison Bailey, it's too common and strong.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|twyjXSVuaa	6 - my least faourite<br>  1 - my faourite<br>  <br>  6.

Addison is a masculine BOYS name. SON of Adam. Since when have girls been sons? There is nothing feminine, girly or unisex about Addison. Plus it's the name of a disease. Caroline is nice.<br>  <br>  Evelyn Faith - Lovely name. I love both Evelyn & Faith.<br>  <br>  Adeline Lucille - Nice name.<br>  <br>  Lucie Elizabeth - Doesn't flow. Lucie is a trashy spelling of Lucy. Elizabeth is lovely. Elizabeth Lucy flows well.<br>  <br>  Eden Savannah - Doen't flow. Not to keen on Eden. Savannah is nice though. Savannah Eden is good.<br>  <br>  Maddison Bailey - Awful. Maddison is a trashy spelling of the masculine BOYS name Madison. SON of Maude/Matthew. Since when have girls been sons? There is nothing feminine, girly or unisex about the name Madison. Bailey is also a boys name.<br>  <br>  My favourite is Evelyn Faith & my least favourites are Addison Caroline & Madison Bailey.|`|jZVeXOjnaa	Addison caroline- cute.<br>  Evelyn faith- i like fatih. but not evelyn.<br>  Adeline lucille- i dont realy like it, sorry.<br>  Lucie elizabeth- dont like lucy.<br>  Eden savannah- cute.<br>  Maddison bailey- my favorite :)|`|xVmrrPEfaa	Don't apologize for the style that you like!<br>  <br>  My most favorite is Evelyn Faith.<br>  My least favorite is Eden Savannah, only because I am not too fond of Eden.<br>  <br>  I do love Evelyn Savannah.|`|t5NjDHoTaa	They're not old fashioned!<br>  <br>  Favourite:  Evelyn Faith<br>  Least:  Addison Caroline<br>  <br>  :-)|`|Z1sPoXVaaa	OMG they are all gorgeous!!<br>  Addison Caroline is my favorite!<br>  Eden Savannah is my next.<br>  I don't know which one to choose as my least because I love them all.

XhJL7tnwaa	Yes, I had quite a few. The first one was at 16wks. My son looked like an alien until close to 30 weeks. The younger he was, the more of his bones I could see when they switched from 2D to 3D/4D. It was pretty neat to see him develop over time that way, but if you are paying to see your child and want the best pictures, try to go after 28wks.
zpuvZtifaa	Amiga, isso é difícil de prever, porque quem pode garantir que você terá a dilata??o necessária para o parto ?|`|3a0baut4aa	Pode chegar a 50 e 60  dias,|`|F1Wfw4HIaa	depende de cada organismo,eu comecei a dilatar  era meia noite e quando foi 6 da manha fui para o hospital e já tinha dilatado 10 centímetros,no entanto n?o deu parto normal,tem mulheres q s?o rapido mas em outras o trabalho de parto já é mais demorado.|`|sI215F8Qaa	Marcela vai logo ter o seu bebe, n?o pode passar muito do tempo, eu tive meu filho de exatas 40 semanas e tinha 1 dedo e meio de dilata??o tb.

E FELICIDADES!!!|`|TGB8fDkXaa	Cada pessoa é diferente mas o que pode ajudar a accelerar a dilata?ao é caminhar...caminhar muito...eu caminhei por 4 horas seguidas pra consegui accelerar a minha dilata?ao.|`|se48EueIaa	Olha n?o tem dia certo n?o, é de 38 a 42 semanas, se chegar nas 42 semanas e nada corre pro hospital q eles v?o enduzir seu parto...<br>  Há qualquer momento ele pode dar sinal pois ele n?o é mais prematuro...<br>  Ent?o boa sorte!!!|`|0hdI18pUaa	depende de cada mulher pode ser pra daqui a um dia dois ou pra daqui á meia hora
nrqWwQBXaa	take my kid away and have my husband kick the s**t out of that person?|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Well, it wasn't on purpose but... I was at the playground with my daughter last summer and some older teens who had no business being on the playground were running around causing trouble. One of them ran right into my daughter on the swing, which is pretty hard to do, baby swings don't go high...<br>  <br>  I yelled at all of them and said she is just a baby and they needed to be careful. If my husband was there he would have ended up in jail after killing them.<br>  <br>  Now we just up and leave when older kids show up. Not worth the risk. The park is huge, surely they have better things to do than hang out in the kiddy area. But whatever.|`|pJiTbIpYaa	I would ask my fiance to talk my daughter to the baby change room and make sure she is ok then i would smack the ***** down who hit my baby.<br>  <br>  Gothika you are my hero, seriously. A guy nearly ran my baby and i down on a pedestrian crossing. PEDESTRIAN CROSSING. I shouted at him "If i ever see you agqain and i don't have my daughter with me, you had better call an ambulance in advance cause your gonna need one". I have not seen him since. We used to shop at the same place and i used to see him all the time and he was always rude to everyone.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	oooh i starred this, ironically bc this is one of my WORST fears and bc yesterday in fact, this crazy drunk woman walking by my mom's house where i was coming out of was yelling obscenities at me and saying i "better go back inside my house, me AND my baby" and basically threatening me 9but walking off while doing so). it still jarred me, that she would dare involve my baby in her crazy rant. honestly it took all my will power not to cuss back at her bc i was holding my baby, and didnt want to risk her going up to me and hurting my baby. but if she HAD gone up to my 7-month-old baby, i woudlve one ran for life and put my baby in the house, then i woudlve gone back out with a baseball bat and beat the living crap out of her, and strangle her.|`|a8IRxC4raa	I would call the police and file assualt charges, because that's what you are describing.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|jfwmelYgaa	I would snap.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	Hey lady, your up late!  LOL me to im in CA its 10:45pm!  For me it would depend on my daughters age and the other child's age that knocked her down.  For example today at the park a baby that was 13 months old pulled my daughters hair and tapped her semi hard on her forehead the Mom told him no and apologized, no big deal he is still little and Mom was on top of it.  Another example the other day I was at the mall play area (it was raining) and a 7 year old boy knocked over my daughter and basically stepped on top of her and ran away!  The mom and dad saw it all and said nothing.  I flipped my sh*t.  Mall security was called and I almost went to jail.  I just lost it, my daughter was screaming and this little sh*t kid refused to apologize.  I can't stand seeing my daughter upset and hurt, even if its just a scratch.  So anyway it just depends on the situation!|`|G9ywiLqvaa	this actually happened to me.  that's why i was so emotional when i answered that wigglebee's question.<br>  <br>  we were lining up at timezone and my kid apparently has been idly pulling this guy's pants leg because he was getting bored.  suddenly, the guy slapped my son's hand!  not so hard, really.  my boy was more shocked than hurt.  <br>  <br>  nonetheless, i pulled my son away from him. and then with my right stiletto boot, stomped heavily on the man's foot.  he squealed, and i said, "oh sorry!" --and then ran off with my son.  lol!<br>  <br>  it was really silly now that i'm remembering it. thank god, my son didn't see what i did.  <br>  oh but i'd do it again.  it's just a mother's primal instinct to protect her cubs. :)|`|JnLoHaoAaa	First I would run over to my child to see if she was ok and ask the parent what that was all about. Depending on the damages done to my child, I would take action from there. I would probably throw in a few choice words. Hey, what can I say?

Word got out fast that my daughter was off limits to idiots. <br>  <br>  We were at the mall one day (she was 4) and some skater punks came running around the corner and up to where she was standing ( on my left) looking at the selection for the hot pretzels. The free samples being above her on top of the display. 6 guys crowded towards us and all of a sudden you could hear a pin drop .. this was after I warned them off. It helped that I was a US Marine so I can be heard when I need to be. 2 of them commented that they were just getting the samples and I had to tell them again to back off. The problem was in order to reach the samples they had to reach over my daughter and it was far enough that they would be leaning almost against her. Anyone with a 4 year old knows at what point her head would be at. Even without that added issue I wasnt going to let it happen. One of the punks came up behind me (too stupid to see his reflection in the glass case in front of me) and raised his board and swung at me. He went to the hospital along with 2 other of his skater punk friends. My daughter was never more than a foot away from me during all of this. <br>  <br>  To this day I still have people come up to us and ask about what happened that day because they were either there or talked to someone who was.|`|BqXSymxjaa	First I would get my child away from the situation, make sure she was ok and then call the cops and have the jerk arrested, because me freaking out would just add to the trauma my kid was already going through, even if she didn't see it, she would feel me.

My baby brother was 2 and following the 'big boys' around and the 14 yo for God only knows what reason shoved him down the stairs! My baby bro ended up with 3 stitches in his chin, while my dad and I took him to the hospital (honestly I cried more then he did cause he's my little sweetie) my mom reamed the kid out called the mother and told her to come and get her son and that they were no longer welcome in our home. I don't know if I would have handled it as well as she did.|`|sAAnquoTaa	Well it's 1:58 here so I'm on the same time as you. Lol! <br>     If anyone even tried to touch my child I'd put them in a rist lock until my husband could get him so I could take my daughter where she couldn't see the violence. I know martial arts so I'd do it in a way it wouldn't look violent while my daughter was there.<br>     He, or she'd never think of putting his or her hands on another child again.<br>  <br>     And that question was a bunch of bullshit.

This kid from Shells class(who she dosen't hang round with) comes up to Sasha and kicks her legs(I wasn't there because Michelle was taking care of them) and tugs at her hair.

"What the fu*k to do think your doing to my sister".<br>  "You little piece of $hit how dare you touch her"<br>  "Tomorrow me and the lads will kill u".<br>  I went down the elevator to see what was going on.

OQnRP6xVaa	My husband and I have adopted two siblings and having been around adoption all of my life I have had an advantage to learn from those situations I have witnessed.<br>  <br>  The way I see it is I get to choose my own attitude about how important I am in the lives of my children. <br>  <br>  I have watched my former mother-in-law Push her adopted children away, and cause them to exclude her as a part of their Discovery and Reconnection with their biological families. Her intolerance and unwillingness to allow her children to Have an Interest has left her Out of something she could have been part of. Granted she adopted in a different day and age. <br>  <br>  As her children were raised she was simply unable to give them information, or allow them to have positive feelings at all about the mother that gave them birth. From the outside looking in I SEE just how much this attitude damaged her children--primarily her son. He developed a negative feeling toward women in general and could never look at a pregnant woman without disdain. Even me, his wife and the mother of his children. He NEVER heard a word about his birth or a story of his life starting. It hurt him and his hurt caused damage to his wife and His Children. <br>  <br>  It's very sad that She is Not a part of the Reunion her son has had during the past 3-years. She has no knowledge of his discovery and there is a huge family secret from Her. She has no clue her grandchildren have found both of their biological grandparents and another fully biological Aunt and cousin. It is sad.<br>  <br>  My cousin on the other hand was raised with floods of information and parents who did not discount her interest in learning about her biological family. When she became an adult she didn't have a huge Need to fill in the blanks but, as often happens one of her biological siblings found her. The reunion with her biological family has been a Shared family event! We are all part of it and all interested in how she is learning about her family. She has had exciting adventures and shared holidays with Both of her Mothers in her home--with her husband and three children. <br>  <br>  I feel that the mother of my children is No Threat to me. She is part of my children she gave them the features they have, their personalities, their natural athletic and music talent! She gave them life! Aside from the fact she was found unfit and Hurt them by her own inability to parent--I have Nothing to worry about. <br>  <br>  When the time comes for my children to be ready and want reunion I don't intend to get worked up about it. I know that IF I do a good job with my children No Matter the Attraction to anyone else, they will come back to me and form the Adult Relationship WE end up having.<br>  <br>  If I make this all about Me and How I feel--I will Lose something! When my children grow up I expect they will Love More then Just Mommy and Daddy--they will hopefully love their own spouses and children and I trust them enough to have room to love Me and their biological Mother for the relationships we each have with them. <br>  <br>  There may be periods of time when they become adults where I am more or less important to them. BUT the fact of the matter is that this happens no matter what with children who become adults.<br>  <br>  My biological son (a former mama's boy) has reinforced my feelings even more! He has become a Man, been college educated and is IN LOVE with Another Woman! My son's girlfriend is no more a threat to me and my relationship with him then any other woman--unless I make if one!<br>  <br>  If we are the best parents we can be--if we give our children the truth and if we give them Permission to Love other people Whats one More Mom or Parent going to matter down the road? It will only matter If I make it matter otherwise I pray to God my little ones grow up and Want to have Me in their lives.|`|DGPUdOOjaa	My daughter and I have a good relationship. It's probably stronger because she met her birth mom. And nothing had changed for the better in the birth moms life during the intervening years--or if so I don't see it.<br>  Are you planning to adopt through an agency, foster to adopt, And I hesitate to say "buy a child" which we never considered. I believe children should grow up knowing they are adopted and loved.|`|EIJm83Psaa	Ok coming from someone who is adopted, i was happy when my parents who adopted me told me. They told all the kids never hide anything. It should not change how the feel or act. I love my parents to death cause if it was not for them i would be god knows where right now. As long as u are up front with them it should be fine. Cause that shows they have someone who really cares that took them in when they didnt have to. So go with your heart. And remember to just tell the truth|`|6bb02259822110ffe8e4a6d8a5c09237aa	don't believe everything you read and raise your children knowing they are adopted.  My friend was raised this way.  It was very helpful for her.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Being adopted myself, I can tell you that it WAS like being raised with strangers.  I don't think that they bonded with me.  I know I didn't bond with them.  It isn't anybodys fault.  We just had personalities that didn't mesh well.  It is like having roommates.  I mean, I cared about them, and them for me, but there was no real bond to speak of.  When my a-mom went off the deep end when I was about 10 things got worse.  I'm not saying that every adoption turns out this way, but many do.  I didn't change.  Our relationship didn't change.  I grew up, matured, and now I'm comfortable calling a spade a spade.  I never felt connected with my a-family.  I used to feel ashamed about it, but I don't anymore.  I tried to be the daughter they always said they dreamed of having, but it was never enough to make me their "real" child.  You just have to take things as they come.  Have open dialog, don't hide things...  just make sure that you LISTEN.  If they talk about their feelings, don't deny them.  Don't placate them, or patronize them.  Let them know that every feeling that they have is legitimate.  That would be my biggest piece of advice.<br>  <br>  ETA:  I've always known I was adopted.|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	This is how you handle it: You do not hide the fact that they were adopted. If they know from the beginning, they will not react in such a way "when you tell them" because they will already know. If you can be open with the mother and father and their family in your adoption, then you should. (if it is legally allowed as many children through foster care do not have that "privilege".) You do not state how you plan to adopt, but I will assume foster care adoption. If you do get an infant or very young child from foster care adoption, just be open about the situation. Pretending they are your own children for ANY amount of time is just a bad idea and there are numerous studies out there that back me up on that.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Don't believe that the majority feel this way.<br>  My husband was adopted as a baby and had no desire to find out about his birth mother when he was told he was adopted. His parents gave him the opportunity and he said "you raised me, you are the only mom and dad I've known, you are my family".  That was that.<br>  <br>  If you raise a child from an infant you must tell them at the earliest possible age (where they'll understand) that they were adopted.  Explain adoption, but not necessarily why they were given up.  The longer you wait to tell them, the more animosity they may feel towards you for not saying something sooner.  It is their right to know, even if they don't ask pertinent questions til later in life.<br>  <br>  If your children get angry or upset do your best to talk with them.  Find out why they are mad and exactly with whom they are mad. Are they angry that they were given up? Angry that they never knew their birth family? Angry because of something you did or didn't do?<br>  Find out if they want to search for their birth parents and help them if you can. Perhaps the bio parents will be able to help them realise they are better off with you and always have been and that you ARE their mother even though you didn't give birth to them.<br>  Try counseling as well.<br>  <br>  Adopting older children is equally difficult but they already know why they can't be with their bio families.|`|b06d2752947c332133b3d703ba6e1c3faa	As an adoptee, I believe when you tell your child he/she was adopted has a LOT to do with how they take it. Almost all of the stories I hear about adopted children doing a 180 involved them finding out when they were into their teens, or finding out by accident, like it had been a dirty secret.<br>  <br>  I knew I was adopted from the time I was old enough to understand the concept. In fact, I don't remember ever NOT knowing I was adopted. I have a brother who was adopted as well as two brothers who are biologically my parents' kids. <br>  <br>  As far as my adopted brother and I are concerned, we only have one set of parents, and they're the two people who raised us. My only interest, and it's marginal at best, in my bio parents is regarding their medical history.<br>  <br>  So, my advice is to make it clear from the beginning that your children were adopted and you made a special choice to bring them into your life. Be aware too that there are a lot of ignorant people out there who view adopted children as somehow less of a child and more of a pet. My dad's (former) attorney was shocked that my parents were including my adopted brother and I in the will, because "You've done enough for them already, taking them in when no one else wanted them" as if we were street urchins caught vandalizing a car and adoption or jail was our only options. I had an old lady at church tell me that I better straighten up and act right and be grateful I had a home because my parents certainly didn't HAVE to put up with me, given I wasn't their real child. Nice huh? Your adopted kids will likely run into some of that, and they need to be pretty secure in the knowledge that they ARE your children. Otherwise, they'll likely start acting out, figuring you'll probably stop loving them at some point and it might as well be at their own choosing.|`|tsNMMLMUaa	I've known adopted people from two different families, both of which were teenagers.<br>  <br>  One was a complete wreck who did herroine at school curses out her parents telling her mother how much of a slut she is and slutting around town with overweight graffiti artists and the other is a chain smoker who hangs outside of hardcore shows and claiming to be part of the "scene."<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|eu6UQElYaa	I've known people who were adopted and they never did that.  They may have been curious about their biological parents but they never turned their backs on their adoptive parents.  To me, I think the key is to be honest from the start.  Don't try to hide the fact that they were adopted but make sure they know that you are their parent now and you love them just like any biological parent would.   <br>  <br>  And don't think that everything you read is an accurate representation of most adoptees.   Usually the only things that get written about are bad experiences, if things go fine and normal people don't tend to say anything.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	It seems like you are talking about adopted parents that did not tell their children that they were adopted until later in life. I am adopted and always know that I was adopted, and I loved my adoptive parents, and always considered them my real parents.  My hubby and I adopted 2 children as well, and told them at a very  young age.  When children find out later, it could come across as being adopted is something to keep a secret or to be ashamed of.  Relationship with adopted children cannot change when they find out they are adopted if it is a household word from the time they are toddlers. They may not understand what it all means, but they can learn as they grow.  Just make sure you share with them early.  Also having as much info about biological mothers can help- but sometimes it can be confusing for the child as well.  There is a balance.  Good luck, and also bless you for wanting to adopt children.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	You need to go into this knowing that you are/will be a parent but you are not the only parent<br>  <br>  Understanding and accepting this fact will go a long way to cementing a loving and stable relationship with an adoptee<br>  <br>  ETA:  Most adoptees love their adoptive parents, but should not be obligated to preface every statement they make about adoption with that fact.|`|YQ1Q7XeEaa	My adoptive parents are my only parents.<br>  <br>  If I were to meet either of my birth parents I could love them and want to know them but they would never be my family.|`|7JEojMgQaa	I have been in reunion for 9 years with my daughter. Her parents were concerned at first that they would be left behind. I may be my daughters mother but I am not her mom. Together we have found her father and again this is his title, not dad, father. <br>  <br>  My daughter loves her parents. She has no reason not to. But that has nothing to do with her ancestry, medical info or finding siblings. <br>  <br>  <br>  Just because people are angry about their secret lives that only they can't know, does not mean they are angry at their parents. It's the system, and the lies told to everyone. Huge difference. <br>  <br>  The system needs changing, the practice of adoption itself needs reform. At some point adult adoptees need to stop being protected by the state from their lives as if they are children. SOME Future adoptive parents need to understand that babies are not blank slates, or the latest fad. <br>  <br>  What you read here is not about hating parents who raised you. It's about change, change to a system that is broken, corrupt, and uncaring about the well being of its very lively-hood, the people who use their services.|`|kf7XLE8kaa	I don't know which posts you're referring to, so I'll just speak in general terms from things I've read on this board in the last year and a half or so.<br>  <br>  When the word "stranger" is used, it's meant to refer to the adoptive parents when they first came into the adoptee's life - not today.  They are no longer strangers NOW, are they?  But once, they were strangers.  However, biological parents were NOT strangers.  The adoptee carries his/her biological parents in every cell of his/her body.  They are connected intimately.  The child is born knowing his mother's voice, her heartbeat, her scent, her emotions, her personality, and he is expecting HER.  So, when that child is placed in a stranger's arms, and the Mother s/he was expecting never returns, that is traumatic.  At that moment in time, all the child knows is that there is a stranger present, and the Mother is gone.<br>  <br>  It is generally accepted that you should share with the adoptee that they are adopted from a VERY young age.  There should never be a moment when they "find out" they are adopted.  They should simply know.  If your relationship with your child is built on lies, yes, they could very well "do a complete 180".  If you found out that your spouse had been lying to you from day 1 about who they were, wouldn't you do a complete 180?<br>  <br>  Most adoptee's that I've spoken with do not suddenly develop issues with their adoptive parents - and whether or not they do develop issues with them seems to have nothing to do with the adoption itself.  If the adoptive parents are abusive, if they lie or keep secrets, if they do not honor the adoptee's personhood (including, but not limited to, their connection with their first parents), then of course they're going to have issues with them.  You would, too, if someone treated you with that lack of respect.  But generally speaking, if adoptive parents are decent people, and put forth the effort necessary to be GOOD adoptive parents, the adoptees I have spoken to have not had issues with their adoptive parents.<br>  <br>  That does not mean they don't have issues with adoption itself.  Adoption begins with the loss of the child's entire family - his/her entire WORLD just suddenly up and walks away.  That's traumatic.  And children do not have the ability to explain what's happening to them.  It can take a lifetime to work through those wounds, and if you plan to be an adoptive parent, you might do well to learn as much as you can about what exactly happens when an adoption occurs.  It looks very different from the perspective of the child - and the first parents - than it does from the perspective of the adoptive parents, who are really the only winners in this scenario.

She read bedtime stories to me nightly. Right now I'm studying to be an early elementary teacher and I'm in a children's literature class. We often talk about the importance of reading and how it expands a child's imagination and intellect. Also, reading to a child when they are young can help influence a love of reading later in life, which will definitely help them later in like when they are required to read.

GHH1i6d3aa	You don't have to be madly in love with the concept of your baby at all times.  Motherhood encompasses all kinds of emotions.

chmuDZObaa	Are you driving?  How far along are you?  The best things you can do are to pack your own snacks and pillows.  Take a pillow for your lower back and one for your head.  Recline when possible and take lots of potty breaks and to stretch and walk around.  Don't push yourself too much--if you have to stop, then stop and take a break.

pm2EeEgiaa	I think the reason why this happened is because either he admires his dad so much so that when he left you he started wanting to feel belongingness - and well, racists give a sense of belongingness to drive people toward their aims.<br>  <br>  This is the root of the problem - obviously, it ain't your German ancestry or his grandfather (although if he admired his grandpa that would be another story) - but it's more about his sense of security and belongingness - and this you should answer.<br>  <br>  Don't confront him with his views - he'll just dismiss your opinions as worthless - he may still be reeling from your divorce with his dad, so just hang in there - talk to him while not explicitly countering his beliefs, ask what are his problems, ask what he wants to say to you, and if needed, schedule an appointment with your pastor, priest, or counselor. However, do stand firm that you don't want him passing around his beliefs to his younger brothers - do not plead, but sternly and lovingly, just say it to him.<br>  <br>  This stage (adolescence) is still in passing though, and the only time you need to really worry big time is when he does vandalizing, assaulting a person of color, or is above the age of 18. <br>  <br>  As of now, just confront about the problem of the absence of his father - this I think, is the main problem.|`|OHfZFR31aa	I would seriously consider therapy for him to find out why he has such hatred towards other races.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	I am American but, I have German ancestry via my late maternal great-grandparents.<br>  <br>  I was also born in Berlin(1967) and, my younger brother in Bonn(1969).<br>  <br>  My parents told me about, having to sneak me through the checkpoints, going between East n' West Berlin.  At any time, had the East German guards found me, my parents would have been thrown in prison and, I would have gone into a foster home.<br>  <br>  The point of my telling you this, is because, while I love having German ancestry, the Nazis' and, anything to do with them is reprehensible.<br>  <br>  Back in 1991, I took a trip through Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Hungary and, Czechoslovakia(now the Czech Republic and, Slovakia).  I went to the Auschwitz concentration camp and, saw the horrible, things the Nazis' had done to people. <br>  <br>  There are NO 'COLORED' kids in school.  There are 'AFRICAN-AMERICAN' kids in school<br>  <br>  I bet your son doesn't even know what prompted the First World War.<br>  <br>  Austrian Arch-Duke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated which prompted the beginning of the First World War.  Following the First World War, the Treaty of Versailles was drawn up, holding Germany accountable for all the financial hardship it caused during the First World War.  Adolph Hitler(1899-1945) was a very young officer during the First World War and, the Treaty of Versailles angered him.  In 1933, at 34yrs.-old, Hitler was elected German Chancellor.  Once elected, he started building his 'war machine'.  Despite what the Treaty of Versailles said.  He annexed Austria(where Hitler was born).  He made a promise, not to invade Poland.  Which he broke on September 1, 1939.<br>  <br>  Your son's ardent racist Nazi-like behavior, needs to be dealt with immediately!!!!|`|upIrlDm5aa	Drop him off in the "hood", Your better off just getting him to interact with different cultures and learn about others rather then just the white people. He will be hesitant at first but don't give into him make him learn about Blacks, Asians, and other foreigners|`|8oKazGVGaa	omg! i think it might just be a faze you better hope he finds better friends who are normal or maybe if it gets really bad you guys should move|`|o8uGsZxmaa	Move|`|9XohPfA4aa	i have a skin head sister but theres nothing i can do about it since she married a skin head and has been that way for a while. maybe something else triggeredd the neo nazi ness. if you need to you can take gory movies and such about nazi movements and what they did show and tell him everything nazis did. if he stomachs it without remorse im sorry.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hosenfeld.dk/gallery/auschwitz/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hosenfeld.dk/gallery/auschwit...</a><br>  <br>  i guess i can only hope that works.|`|8lOjRnEJaa	Move. Preferably in a predominately black or latino community. You'll see how racist he'll stop being.|`|5B02WP2waa	AAAHHH!<br>  <br>  Yeah, I was like that for two days when I was 10.<br>  <br>  No no no, he'll get over it.<br>  <br>  Take him for a trip to Auschwitz.<br>  <br>  I DON'T LIKE THOSE CAPITALIST NAZIS. AND YOU ARE READING THIS FROM A 14 YEAR OLD COMMUNIST! >.<<br>  <br>  Ok, explain this to him. If he wants to be a nazi, he must not like communists. communists were the original target of the holocaust. whyy jews? because Karl Marx, our great inventor, was Jewish. This is not the only thing about Nazis, and this is not the only reason. Seems like he knows very little about it. I won't go into details since it's rather complicated and bit off-subject.<br>  <br>  So you son doesn't like:<br>  -Poles<br>  -Soviets<br>  -Jews<br>  -Communists<br>  and many many more.<br>  <br>  Tell him to go and read Mein Kampf. If he won't understand a thing from it, he has no idea what he's talking about.<br>  <br>  Nazism has very few good sides to it. 99% is bad, including it's accursed name.<br>  <br>  You must explain capitalizm to him, and that being a Nazi is not only about ethnical cleansing.<br>  <br>  See what he actually knows about being a Nazi. Ask him questions like<br>  -who is considered unhuman?<br>  -why should the Jews be exterminated?<br>  -why should we have capitalism<br>  -what's capitalism<br>  -which countries supported Germany during the WW2 and holocaust<br>  -what relationship did Stalin and Hitler have<br>  -why was the Soviet-Nazi pact formed<br>  -Who and why broke the Soviet-Nazi pact<br>  <br>  Really, he'll start doing more research and soon will realize in how much mistake he is.<br>  <br>  Make him watch 'Grey Zone' 'Pianist' 'Schindler's List' 'Boy in the striped Pijamas' 'Invincible''Holocaust' 'The Nazi Officer's Wife (I really reccomend, he'll change his mind straight away.)'<br>  <br>  Give him 'The Nazis' and 'Auschwitz' by Laurence Rees to read.<br>  He'll quickly reject Nazism...<br>  <br>  Good luck, and go to the police and report this Nazi group- that's illegal!|`|pE5E5L5naa	you have to let your son understand one thing.  what it means to be proud.  He's german so its normal to be proud of his nationality.  But he needs to understand the main drive of the nazis.  They hated every other race and thought themselves as far superior.  Hate is not a way through salvation.  It brings about violence, which regards to his fight.  Let him know that the great Einstein himself, who contributed so much to our scientific advancements is jewish himself.  Let him know that we must bring the world closer together, not strain the relationships between human races.  The latter would just bring about war.  also, there are plenty of youtube videos regarding the persecution of jews, let him watch it and see if he feels any sympathy.  if he doesn't you need to get him away from his nazi friends
igvUbqkyaa	My favorites are Emilee Grace, Alexander William (Alex), and Martin James - I love the nickname Marty!! I also think James Martin sounds good and flows a bit better than Martin James but both are nice!|`|EvyY3dUNaa	hmm i lykd <br>  Alexander William DiGiovanni (Alex) <br>  Johanna Claireces DiGiovanni <br>  these names have a royal touch ..<br>  and sounds tooo nice..|`|N8nsJPUDaa	Hunter Elise DiGiovanni..<br>  And her nickname could be (Elle) from her middle name<br>  Or (Honey) which I think is adorable<br>  :)|`|HvX6KvK1aa	crystal emma<br>  sapphire louise
pOekC2Sqaa	Mia Anne - Mia is a 4/10, Anne is a 6/10. Together it's a 5/10. Mia Anne is pretty, but it feels like Mia and Anne are just one name so it's Mianne, due to the "a" ending, and "a" beginning. It's a nice name though, and Mia, though I'm not a huge fan of it, is quite unique. Mia means "Sea of Bitterness" and is a Scandinavian name, whilst Anne is a Hebrew name which means "Gracious, Merciful". <br>  <br>  Amy Lee - Amy is a 8/10, and Lee is a 5/10. Together it's 6.5/10. I love the name Amy, and Lee is a nice name but the feminine spelling of it is Leigh, whilst Lee is the boy's spelling. Amy Lee is actually the name of the lead singer in Evanescence, and that's what immediately came to mind upon reading the name. Personally I prefer Aimee, but Amy is a Latin name which means "Beloved" and Lee/Leigh means "Field" and is an English name. <br>  <br>  Lily May - Lily is a 10/10 and May is an 8/10. Together they're 9/10. This name is gorgeous. The only thing I actually don't like is the spelling of May, I prefer it spelt Mae. Out of the three names, this is my favourite. Lily is an English name and means "Lily Flower" whilst May is an English name which means "Goddess Maia". <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. All in all you're Aunt's chosen stunning names.<br>  <br>  G2B|`|ccccf2dbeb590052b4953d1fbdf1eb20aa	I like them<br>   CONGRATULATIONS|`|V1TIIiL9aa	Mia Anne and Lily May are simple beautiful. Amy lee, not so much<br>  <br>  awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww <3|`|AA10151168	yes nice names if mia would be mimi they would sound in harmony|`|Z6AcG5GNaa	Mia's okay. Anne is a regular middle name--no sparks for me. I've never liked the name Amy, as it is so plain, and I don't like Lee either. Lily is also okay, and May's not bad.<br>  <br>  All in all, they are average names and the girls probably won't have problems with their names when they're older (though Amy is rather dated these days).|`|E431yL9Gaa	Instead of Mia, change it to Bagina. (Ba-jine-a)<br>  <br>  Its an up and coming name in Switzerland :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|HvX6KvK1aa	great|`|tHEBPDenaa	I like Lily May. It's very cute and feminine.<br>  <br>  Mia Anne is okay. <br>  <br>  Amy Lee is kind of boring and I don't really like either name (Amy or Lee).|`|UbCzA2JVaa	Aww they are so adorable! Congrats and good luck to your Auntie! I like the pattern she used.<br>  <br>  <br>  :)
op55FtqYaa	Loose bowel movements are a big give away. There seems to be a universal acknowledgement that we clear out before we go into labour. <br>  <br>  The cramping pain starts and its hours apart and can sometimes disappear for days. However, it will eventually have a rhythm to it - closer together and it'll come in waves. When it get "painful" ring the hospital and make your way there. <br>  <br>  If you start to feel hot/dizzy/vomit-y then go to hospital because it may be your blood pressure rising like mine did. <br>  <br>  Good luck, youll be fine|`|59GymH27aa	Our little babies just like to tease us sometimes.  I thought I was going into labour for about 10 days and then everything just stopped.  I ended up not going into labour until the day before I was induced.  Your body is just preparing itself for the birth of your baby.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your little one|`|74C2DOKGaa	Totally normal!<br>  <br>  I was dilated 2 cm for like 3 weeks and was hoping to go into labor, but it never happened. I had to be induced... but don't worry, everyone's different and you'll do just fine!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If your doctor isn't concerned then I wouldn't be. You may have actually been sick before and weren't in labor.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Sounds like you had a mild flu or food poisioning, once it really starts it just keeps progressing. When I had my three kids, I went from happy healthy straight into hard labor, no other ill affects at all. Congrats hun, hope you dont have to wait too long!!
fUvB4MGWaa	Early. I helped set-up and greeted everyone when they came.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	Definitely do not be late.<br>  <br>  You could show up 15 minutes or so before. At my shower I came there with my mom and mother in law 2 hours early because I have never met most of my husband's family and wanted my MIL to explain who was all coming.|`|n3PE2lvDaa	Id get there before the guests to greet them|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Since the shower is in your honor, you don't have to help set up or decorate or anything like that.  It's the hostess's job.  But you probably should be there a little early because you do want to be there when the guests start showing up.  Don't worry about greeting guests as they arrive (that also is the hostess's job).  Just be sure to make yourself very available for guests to come greet you.  Have fun and remember--you and your little bundle of joy are the guests of honor!|`|4TNavgDuaa	Fashionably late. I didnt know about my shower so I took my time. I felt bad when I notice it was my shower and everyone waited 1 1/2 hours.|`|jYPeis3Saa	be there when people arrive. <br>  <br>  its rude to show up to a party that is in honor of you!  plus people will probably wonder where you are.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	fashionably on time|`|Rk05cRZraa	Be there early so you can help get stuff ready and greet your guest know your tired but its a good thing to do|`|HFWLYMD6aa	You have to be there early, you are the host. Also they have come to see you.|`|IHDVQs3kaa	Most definitely be there to greet your guests.
d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	All kids are different. My daughter used to love watching Monsters Inc... then it hit her. She has a closet in her room and that was enough of that movie. <br>  <br>  By the same token she watched the water horse and was scared because off all the bad men shooting. <br>  <br>  Different thigns will scare kids differently. You have the right idea... let her watch the movie and you watch her. Let her talk about what she is seeing. Guage her reactions. <br>  <br>  Good Job.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I bought my son (3 at the time) the Goosebumps series for Halloween and he has watched all of them.  He also recently watched ET and that was a little scary for him (but he loves it!!!).  I did have to mute the TV twice though for ET.|`|1hciyvKdaa	No, I dont watch them myself, and I did not approve of my kids watching Freddy and all the others, I even stopped being friends with my best friend who would play these movies while babysitting my kids. I feel it is harmful, and not healthy to enjoy watching movies about human suffering.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	I'm the same - I grew up watching scary movies with my dad, and I've always LOVED them!  And I've always felt kinda sorry for my friends who get too scared or don't like them.  They don't know what they're missing!  So I vowed that my kids would NOT grow up to be scary-movie-wimps!  I started letting them watch the milder ones from a young age, and gradually move on the the scarier ones.  My daughter has adapted well - she's grown to love them as much as I do.  But my son, I guess, is just a natural born scaredy cat.  Try as I might, he just doesn't enjoy them.  Wakes up with nightmares.  So I don't force it on him.|`|sAAnquoTaa	As a child I loved movies like Freddy, Jason, and Halloween. I was only 3 when I started loving them. I'll just have to see what kinda girl my daughter is when she's old enough. If she's very sensitive and gets scared easily then no way, but if she really likes them I'll let her watch them...first nightmare from one and she won't watch them anymore though.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	all depends on the individual child. I wish my parents had watched what I watched on TV more.... course, I watched like Silk Stalkings.....which was all about sex and rape and stuff..... I know how it effected me :(|`|5nfqY9T7aa	When I have kids, I'll let them watch scary movies if I feel they are mature enough.|`|JivuAmfiaa	I'll let my eleven year old watch them but for my seven and five year olds it's a no-go area. Mind you, my seven year old once went to a car-boot sale and swapped a gory horror movie into a Care Bears' case which we bought, and then proceeded to watch it upstairs in his room. He's fascinated by the screaming and the gory bits and yells at the TV all the way through the movie. My daughter hates them and hides behind the sofa at something as mild as Sabrina the Teenage Witch. But that's kids for you :)|`|fdxQlQZ5aa	well I'm a huge horror fan, always was! My 14 year old loves horror movies too,  Sometimes he gets scared AFTER its over, but he never has any problem during the movie probably because he's always cuddling up against me under the blanket when a scary scene comes up!. He would never ever watch a horror movie by himself though lol!<br>  We always watch something new every weekend. Last Friday we watched the newest texas chainsaw massacre(The beginning) and was jumpy at a few scenes but he wasn't too scared after it was over. The one movie that really got to him was Silence of the Lambs, he was too afraid to sleep alone for about 2 weeks...And I was the one that asked him if he wants to watch it with me (yep big mistake lol)<br>  <br>  It depends on the content of the movie, a slasher type would be totally fine for us, I think those are pretty fun and entertaining. But the ones that go deep and physiological are always alot more scary and the ones that give nightmares. We'll watch them still, we watch stuff that both of us have never seen before, way more fun that way =)<br>  <br>  I think that if a younger kid likes slasher movies like freddy or jason it would be okay as long as they aren't being too exposed to explicit sex content. And as long as they aren't getting nightmares everytime they watch something new.  My son and I will watch pretty much anything, except for stuff that is full of long sex scenes and stuff like that. Horror movies usually don't have THAT much sex in them, and usually are offscreen.|`|RSczEcZCaa	My boys love to watch scary movies but i notice that either one of them gets a nightmare whenever i let them. i think it gets stuck in their subconscious minds, but it's ok. at least they have a nice scary story to tell their brothers when they wake up.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	I'm 14, nearly 15 and I have been watching scary movies for as long as I can remember and never had nightmares, I love them :)<br>  I would let my kids watch them.|`|estIQEVNaa	Watching Teletubbies or something is horrifying enough.|`|4ykO2wj9aa	Nothing wrong with a good horror movie I was watching them at 5|`|EgdR7cfTaa	i grew  up watching freddy and jason..those were my favorite movies when i was a kid and they still are
zVZgYEjMaa	My wife watched, but frankly, I've seen so few treatments of adoption done well on television that ultimately I had to leave the room.  It sounds like it went as badly as I expected it to.  Maybe worse, even.  Ugh.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	I think that either the show's writers are so intelligent, they put the storyline above the heads of average people, or they're so ignorant that they condone how that adoption happened.<br>  <br>  It also pointed out how telling the child the truth from day 1 is important.  Kids know in their hearts if they're adopted I think.  I also think that the way you raise them, with love and understanding, and truth, that they will make up their own minds whether or not how attached they are.  I know grown adoptees who love their adopted parents VERY much, even though they have reunited, and I know natural kids who hate their parents.|`|DmJFln79aa	"Do you think the fact the Adoptive Mother nearly died for the wrong blood type was a legitimate Scare Tactic that was designed to effect Change in the attitude?"<br>  <br>  She isn't the adoptive mom.  She is the sister of the bio dad who ran and left the child.  She acted as her mother, but nothing was ever done legally, which was discussed in a prior episode.  I'm not sure how the wrong blood type played a part in the story line of her not knowing the truth, other than it came up in discussion....which could've come up in any setting, to be honest.<br>  <br>  <br>  "Or do you think the point of Telling a Child the truth was Lost Completely with all the Drama of the Dr's Desire to Adopt?'<br>  <br>  <br>  Actually, the dr didn't want to adopt.  She may want to in another episode, but she didn't through the one last night.  Her husband brought up adoption, but she was against it.  However, the girl made a comment on her views of what a mother really is, which might change the dr's attitude about adoption in the future.|`|PKUPgmnwaa	Technically, the situation wasn't an adoption.  The brother left his daughter with the mother (his sister, not the bio mom) - and no adoption ever took place.  The sister then just raised her as her own.<br>  <br>  I don't think it made a comment either way on telling the child the truth - but it could and should have.|`|0KQM91moaa	argh i didnt watch it but i dont like that attitude|`|NclIWyDQaa	I think children have a right to know where they came from, for both their physical and mental well-being.<br>  <br>  The 'ER' situation is definitely a complex one, and frankly, I was too distracted by Angela Basset's character's attitude toward adoption to think about the way that they had written in the story about the girl.<br>  <br>  I think that the intention is to present all of the concerns that people have about adopting children, and that the girl's role is to oppose them, by showing that those concerns shouldn't really matter in the long term. It's in direct contrast to the doctor's needs. She has to control everything, especially after the death of her son, that she sees adoption as another way of giving up that control she has build up over her life. She is developing this ridiculous way of having another child, doing everything she can to make every decision, and I think ultimately it will be shot down.<br>  <br>  She is continuously presented with these family situations that are bad and make her question her own decisions (a month ago it was that foster child situation). Confronting the doctor with a girl who doesn't know about her past is an intentional contrast, meant to develop her character more. Whether or not the situation is reflecting a certain attitude isn't the point. Yes, it is outrageous to those of us who are personally connected to adoption. But this type of situation happens, unfortunately. I think that the storyline will reach a point where the overall attitude towards adoption is presented positively, and where the common viewer will agree that the show is definitely suggesting that everyone should know where they came from. Even if we're not necessarily seeing that now.|`|juyJY3Lraa	hmm tough answer but id go with yea
5c079cb1c9fa7ffe7d3cdc8fa57061a6aa	cute with asher<br>  same with emmeline<br>  <br>  but it might be pronounced as Emma-line<br>  <br>  like emma line or emme line<br>  <br>  it rhymes with caroline|`|tHEBPDenaa	sounds good. i love elliot and asher is growing on me. <br>  emmeline is also growing on me and i'm really starting to love it. and i think grace is a good middle name. i would spell it emmeline or emmelyn... depending on how you want it pronounced... i would pronounce emmeline like em-ma-leen and i would pronounce emmelyn like em-ma-lin.<br>  <br>  all of the spellings are fine though,,, just remember that people will pronounce it how it looks!|`|Z6AcG5GNaa	I like Emmeline because that's the original spelling, and it looks graceful (which would go well with the middle name). I LOVE the name Elliot, but I prefer it to be spelled "Elliott." If you're Jewish, Asher would be a great middle. However, even if you're not Jewish, it still goes nicely with Elliot.<br>  <br>  Great names!|`|V1TIIiL9aa	Emmaline.|`|nZjyIAVhaa	I hate the boy's name.

yV373JUiaa	I would have sex to cover the time the test is telling you. Then watch for EWCM perhaps your surge is going but your body is having some trouble, it's also possible that you lack cervical discharge that helps the sperm along. If the second is true then you should get some preseed online. It is a sperm friendly lube that can help women who do not have alot of mucus. I for one have never found EWCM around my ovulation time.
mgLNIfiIaa	Congrats on your granddaughter! : ) <br>  <br>  Ashton isn't a boy's name. It was used more on girls throught the 80s and 90s, until Ashton Kutcher became famous and then people started using it on boys now. Most Ashtons in high school and college are girls. Even if you don't personally like it it isn't a name that will hold her back in life, since it's all a matter of personal tastes I'm not sure if it's worth trying to change her mind, you have to pick your battles when it comes to daughters in law.<br>  <br>  I don't like the spelling Makenzie, I think Mackenzie is a lot more classy and better looking. If you have to respell it, spell it as McKenzie.<br>  <br>  But I like both Mackenzie and Ashton for grils.|`|SFu6L2Ghaa	A good name as a middle name would be like.. Alexandra, Alejandra, Caroline, janice, Jannet, alice, arvina,Anivra, tatianna,illiana, althea.. Thats All I can think of..

B5MDTdtPaa	anywhere between 10 and 20hours seriously it differs greatly - average is about 16hours..my baby has never slept more than 12 hours in a 24 hour period in her life - but my mother said i was the same...now shes 5 months old and sleep about 10 hours at night and has an hour nap in the day..so 11hours..thats all she wants and all she needs as shes growing great and hitting milestones early and her doctors v happy with her progress x some babies love sleep, sadly for me my baby doesnt lol i remember when my baby was very young - about your babies age - she would stay awake up to 8 hours a time and whatever i did she jsut owuldnt want to sleep i would spend hours rocking her.pushing her in pram, in a dark quiet room everything to get her to sleep but she wouldnt - i was very worried as i heard everyone elses babies were only up for like 3 hours maximum at a time and stuff but doctor said all babies are different and not to worry shes doing great :) x|`|b70c76c680f23b7b2d94815940d49450aa	What things are you doing with him while he's awake? Perhaps more mental stimulation or some tummy time on the floor or activity mat?<br>  <br>  Take him out in the pushchair for a walk and maybe the fresh air and visual stimulation will tire him out.|`|slILtaEiaa	I'd say babies should be sleeping about 15-18 hours a day at 6 weeks, still. But, 6 weeks is a time of a HUGE HUGE HUGE growth spurt, as well. The 6 week growth spurt is quite possibly the biggest one he will have. Just ride it out, and I'd be willing to bet he will settle into a routine that's more "normal" soon!|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Sounds like he is overtired, which is giving him difficulty sleeping.

kaqPSgTVaa	The doctors usually go by date of your last period. When you get farther along they'll do an ultrasound and get a more precise reading on how far along you are.<br>  <br>  FYI I got symptoms MUCH sooner with my second pregnancy that I did my first. Anything is possible. I got symptoms about 9 days past ovulation and got a positive about 12 days past ovulation.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	congrat, the doctor will go by the first scan u have, u sound to be about 7-8weeks|`|VMASMHX6aa	Congrats on your BFP!<br>  <br>  Even though you know when you ovulated, the doctors will go off the date of your last period until you have a scan as they assume every woman has the same cycle!<br>  If you want to, you can 'adjust' your dates yourself to make your LMP match your ovulation date. Just take 2 weeks off the date when you ovulate and that will be how far along you are.|`|h1AIzD9baa	my period was never regular..

xjRCdRnxaa	Hey it says implantatioi can occur around 8-12days after conception (though give or take, some web-sites vary with info!).<br>  So it is a bit early, but you also never know. <br>  Everyones dif, some women say they knew almost instantly, others, have no idea - very frustratingly, it is just a case of wait and see...though you can buy First Response Early Predictor which can work from as early as 5days before missed period!<br>  <br>  Good luck :-)|`|6zuoRhFvaa	i think you're body may be playing tricks on you, its waaaayy to early to be experiencing those kinds of symptoms. if you conceived during ovulation, the egg has barely even implanted yet, you're body doesn't even know its pregnant yet! <br>  <br>  give it two weeks.
n2O0NwR6aa	Wow, that's tough to combine Emma and Ruth!  Emmeth?  Ertha?  Hmmm.. Emma-Ruth is about all I can come up with that doesn't sound weird.

Maybe you could make Ruth "prettier" by changing it to Rutha, or Ruth-Anne?|`|tHEBPDenaa	i would use emma as a first name. i dont think of it as old-fashioned at all... i know it's been around for a long time but it still makes me think of a sweet little girl. i would make her first name Emma and her middle name Ruth. <br>  I do think of Ruth as a very old-fashioned name so I would use that as her middle name...<br>  I can't think of any ways to combine the 2 names into one though... good luck!|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Why not just Emma Ruth?

1xsUVtzBaa	I am in the same boat as you but 3 months on im still not preg. During the 3 months after a miscarriage you are 1.5 times more likely to fall preg..but it's risky as the lining of your uterus may not be built up enough to implant yet. I would try seeing if you get one regular period..i know mine have changed since my miscarriage (gone from 7 days of hell to bout 2 days) which is not normal for me but a true blessing!<br>  It is quite possible that you may have fallen preg straight after and missed your period completely. The best thing you can do is think positive...i think it has alot to do with stress levels..rub ya tummy and tell it mummy wants you and loves you..and just eat well. <br>  Good luck hunny
cUxdsuamaa	depo is the worst birth control to be on. it took me 4 and a half years to get regular periods, and five years to get pregnant. didn'tyou read the insert. only 90 percent get pregnant after 18 months. you might be the 10 percent.|`|brkvK1Teaa	Sounds like your body is out of whack after all of those birth control treatments.  Your body may take some time to recoup back to normal.  Also I hope you and your boyfriend have actually decided that you want a baby.  Sounds like you made the decision or are just gambling.

It took a year for me to get pregnant. There are only certain times you can get pregnant. Maybe you just aren't doing it at the right time.

7Q1dJoFzaa	it is not my job to monitor ur snatch|`|kaqPSgTVaa	That depends on how long your periods normally are. No two women are the same. Most people have 28 day cycles but they can range anywhere from 25-35. <br>  <br>  You really probably should have gotten a period though by now. It's been 49 days. You should take a pregnancy test or see a doctor.|`|Ox81PJ9eaa	are u seriously asking complete strangers this question about your period??? No one but you knows when your next period is going to come. Everyone has their period for different amounts of time, some have them every 25 days some more some less. You should know your own body, not be asking someone on here|`|9BxpGX3Daa	Lol! Keeping track of your snatch is sort of funny. But the others are right- it's different for everyone and only you can tell when it's happening. The amount of days may not be the same- one month it could the whole 28 days and the next it could 31 days etc. Everything from stress, to what we ingest etc plays a part in the monthly visit from your "aunt." If you are into sports and practice a lot, this has been known to pretty much stop or ligthen a woman's menstruation. Plus as someone said, you could be pregnant but only way to know is through a test. Maybe it's time to see a gynecologist?|`|ePEQcIz3aa	It depends. I have a 28 day ovulation, so mine is 4 weeks after the last cycle started.<br>  <br>  So, if yours is 28 days, then you should've got your cycle on January 29th.  If not, you're extremely late and should consult a doctor.|`|bf977d45406286cec89ce77e17169069aa	you could check this out on an ovulation calender and they'd let you know your cycle.  www.yourdays.com is one<br>  <br>  if you're regular, you should have had your period in the beginning of february.
uiQGzWLFaa	I've heard that ovulation happens around 12-14 days after a period cycle, and the egg has 24 hours or so to meet with the sperm, so it might be safe to try for pregnancy once a night starting around 10 days after your last cycle and continue for the next 5 nights or around that. <br>  <br>  I hope this isn't offending in any way.<br>  <br>  I found this site, if it helps.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/how-to-get-pregnant/PR00103" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/how-to-...</a>|`|ilLPvvU7aa	I would use the ovulation kits that you can get at pharmacies and also, once the baby dance is done, don't stand up or anything, stay lying down and try and elevate your hips (with a couple of pillows or something) for about half an hour to help the swimmers get to where they need to be.  I read about that when we were trying.....must have worked although we weren't trying for as long.  Positions - well anything really where you are lying down.  I wish you all the best and hope you don't have to wait much longer, good luck!!!|`|BpUo2WGkaa	I read somewhere that kiwi fruit can help?|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I would see your doctor at this point. Have you tried ovulation kits?
7HzfgRmwaa	3.5 ounces?? Are you sure?? Mine weighed 13 oz at this time. Each baby is different. However, this weight would alarm me too. Call in the morning and speak to the nurse or doc at your office and ask them. Only they know for sure!|`|1jwbQaZTaa	if you know the exact wieght, that would mean your doc told you, and he probably would have told you if this was not normal. personally i do not know, but i would suggest asking the doctor that gave you the wieght.
kaqPSgTVaa	Sometimes that is true yes which is why when you have a miscarriage you need to be monitored from the beginning to the end. A lof of women need a D&C to help get the rest of the baby out.|`|cQq9vTTraa	this is true sometimes some part of the tissue remains inside.this has to be removed by doing D&C.
Si9hhcW1aa	It is fine for the baby to sleep that long. It is actually best to get the baby on a set schedule as soon as possible. If your child is already sleeping most of the night, then you are one of the blessed! Just watch your baby's appetite during the day. As your child gets older, her eating habits will change and be less frequent. Just make sure she is getting all the nutrients she needs.|`|g9TxgMlwaa	Yes, your just one of the lucky parents. The baby will know when she's hungry and let you know. When my son was first born he'd sleep 6 hours straight before eating. It used to irritate both me and my son when the nurses would come in to wake us both up for feeding. The baby will let you know when she's hungry. My son is now 2 years old. He's perfectly fine|`|EFc8VGwRaa	of course its alright for a baby to sleep that long my baby from the day he was born sleeps right from 9.30pm until 6.30 then has something to eat and goes right back to sleep for another 4-5 hours..you dont need to wake a baby to feed they will tell you when they are hungry and as long as she is gaining the right amount of weight she will be fine so let her sleep as you need the sleep to!!!!!|`|bc9inzicaa	Lucky you!  <br>  <br>  It's fine for your baby to sleep that long...if she is hungry and wants to be fed, she will definitely let you know.
KDNWFuZWaa	I was like this with my first son, He was due on March 3 and arrived march 24th. I was not only desperate to see my feet again, I was desperate not to waddle and the water retention in the last week was horrific. I did look like a beached whale.<br>  I tried curries, it did not work. I tried walking, it did not work. I tried sex, and tried, and tried, it did not work. I tried a massage oil with oils that help send the uterus in to contractions, that kick started me and I was taken in for an emergency section.<br>  Not due to the oil once I was in labour they found I was not opening up so they had to as we both were going into distress.<br>  So if nothing else is working, try speaking to an aromatherapist, if not I am sorry to say you will be induced in hospital they really don't like you going a week over, never mind what I went.<br>  All the best and soon you and your little one will be cuddled up together. :-)))|`|EFc8VGwRaa	walk and walk and walk some more...up smallish hills/stairs and have lots of sex!!!

Gin and Tonic! Don't do this! You can drink tonic water as it has quinine and that may actually set off labour, the gin bit is a farse.<br>  <br>  2.A hot curry...This depends on how resilient you usually are with currys (i.e how hot can you go before the toilet is needed)<br>  <br>  3.SEX! This is my favourite, although not everyone feels like it at that stage. Apparently the chemicals released when you orgasm sets off labour.<br>  <br>  4.Castor oil...BIG NO NO...it can cause the baby to poo before born which is very dangerous.<br>  <br>  5.Gentle exercise such as swimming...but this isn't recommended if you have to trek to your local leisure centre to do it!<br>  <br>  <br>  hope it all goes well!|`|JXFYdTqmaa	a very spicy home made curry with dry chilli, this worked for me and my sister when we were pregnant and we both had our babies the next day! lol<br>  <br>  i made her one last weds and she had a beautiful baby boy thursday morning....trust me it works.! :) xxx good luck xx|`|SHQHnKfcaa	Man .... oh Man i know how you feel, trust me...my son weighed 10lbs and 6 oz when born.<br>  <br>  walk, warm baths, sex, practice breathing...inhale exhale, laying on the floor and bring you legs up slowly and bring them down slow....do it about ten times and rest in between too.|`|9qbwPUIqaa	HAVE SEX!!

59GymH27aa	Firstly what an absolutely awful thing to do to tell your family you were raped! If my daughter was raped it would break my heart...so instead of trying to not make yourself 'look bad' you should have thought of all the people you were hurting when you said that.<br>  <br>  Secondly, he tried to be with you for your daughters sake...it didn't work out.  I don't think that you should try and get child support because you didn't want him to even be known as the father in the first place. Yeah, he does sound like a guy into some really bad stuff so you are better just getting on with your life and trying to forget him.  The further away from each other you are the better.  For your daughters sake<br>  <br>  Sorry if this sounds a bit harsh but couldn't make out many of the details due to the bad grammer and length of your post.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	he doesnt sound like a good guy to have in your life, the other guy sounds better|`|u0mZAPuDaa	What?<br>  <br>  ...could you repeat that?|`|47M20WOUaa	F#$%k him if he wants to move to the Philippines then let him if he does not want to be in you and your daughters life then who needs him find some one who will love and adore you and your daughter. who would want a dad like that but if he does not want to be in your daughters life then we does not know what he will miss.

Believe me, I tried that.  My kids were wise to me.  <br>  <br>  What do I really suggest?  Don't get offended, but your letter shows a lack of education.  That doesn't mean stupid, it mean uneducated.  I think you need to forget men for awhile (so far you have a total loser and then the unemployed guy)  You need to go to school to improve yourself, for yourself and your daughter, and then you'll attract a better class of man.  Your ex will eat his heart out when he sees some well adjusted sweetheart loving you and your little girl and being the man (your ex) should be.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	if you NEED the child support get it, meaning, if you are taking checks from the gov, get his support. Its not our job to pay for your child. If however you are totally self supportive, then let it be. But know he can come back into your life and your baby's later, and fight for his rights. Is it right for you to deny you child their father? I don't know. Your child will hate you for it later. When you have a child, it is time to grow up an learn how to play nicely with the father of your baby.....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  edit: SOrry, I didn't mean to sound like you were taking lots of money from the gov, I just was making aa point. If you need no help, then screw him. Sometimes hard working moms need help too.|`|BpUo2WGkaa	To tell you the truth I would just sieze all contact with him. He doesnt seem reliable, if he is moving that far away then it doesnt seem like he wants to be there for your daughter. <br>  <br>  If I was in your situation I would tell him to just leave and never to come near you or your daughter again, he sounds like plain bad news. I wouldnt even worry about child support from him because then he has a right to be with your daughter and Im not sure that is the best thing for her.<br>  Maybe when she is older and he has sorted himself out and she asks maybe you could try and establish a  relationship between your daughter and him. <br>  BUt not unless he straightens himself out.<br>  <br>  So, personally I would just stop tlaking to him full stop. Sieze all contact. I know it seems harsh for your daughter but I think she'd be better off.

W6vv68CVaa	Well I don't agree with all those people that said it wasn't your place to tell. It's not like some tattle tale "Mommy she took my crayon!" This is serious. Both of your sisters are putting themselves in a situation where they could get into a lot of trouble. I'm disappointed that young children are doing that. Your younger sister is my age, 14. I would never think of doing it. It is your duty to your sisters that you will tell your parents. Your sisters don't have to know, but in the end you're saving them from a lot of hurt. Do you think a 14 year old boy who isn't supposed to be doing IT is going to stick around to raise a baby? No way, that's why sex is left for marriage. Let your parents deal with the punishments and the speeches... One day, your sisters will thank you, believe me. The same thing happened to my mom. She was in your position. We are christian to and it is sad to see so many young kids ruining their education for sex... OH well, it's your responsibility to make the right choice and I trust you will. I hope this helped.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Do not go to your parents over this! It is their business, and 17 is normal to be having sex, 14 is young but again if she wants to do that then there's really nothing you can do to stop her. I would take her aside and talk to her, tell her about pregnancy and STD's and everything like that.|`|vfBG0vV0aa	Let the 17 year old have sex ( She is old enough to make her own choices) I think you should advise the 14 year old again though|`|4pkFJxNJaa	I would let them know that you are planning to tell your mother and inform them of why. This isn't the world it was anymore, these kids are not only subjected to pregnancy and STD's but a whole new line of violence stemming from sex. These are children, while I believe the 17 year old is probably got things covered, a 14 year old is really young and who is she sleeping with. 1. Boys her age who are by all standards not old enough to understand the connections that go with sex. or 2. older men..I need not continue on that...at least for the 14 year old there needs to be an intervention..She may resent you for awhile, but better resentment then pregnancy, and STD or a body bag.|`|BgZu3Ndiaa	wow they have their morals messed up, if they get pregnant then they are SCREWED. this is why i hate being 16 and a girl. everyone is having sex around me and i'm all like ,"What about school and a good foundation for your future?" "What if you get a disease?"<br>  -why can't my damb classmates wait till they're at least not in their TEENS, they have like 80 years left to have as much sex as they want, they need to concentrate on school and not minor urges.|`|BpUo2WGkaa	It's theur choice. <br>  I wouldn't tell your parents. <br>  That would be the last thing I would do.<br>  <br>  I would discuss to the 14 year old about laws and contraception again, but I wouldnt make either of them promise to stop, they're going to do it anyway, and they may resent you some what at the time being for making them promise things like that.<br>  <br>  Also religion is a personal choice and they may follow it but they may not believe in everything they are told, like wiaitng til they are married to have sex.<br>   Personally I would just chat to them and show them that you are there for them if they need to talk or ask you questions.  <br>  <br>  It's better for them to have a supportive sister that helps them do things properly then to have one they resent.|`|DxU2GOIfaa	It is a tough call.  The most important thing is to be upfront with your sisters about what you are doing and why... they may be mad if you decide to tell but at least they will hear it from you and not a screaming mom or dad.  If you decide not to tell I would also tell them why.  I would imagine it would be because they are not in danger and are taking the proper precautions against STDs and pregnancy.  I think that it is important here to stress that if something changes in the choices that they make you would then have to reconsider your decision.  Again, I could go either way this and I think that only you know what you need to do... Just be HONEST with your sisters about what you are planning.|`|M7Ozqujtaa	For me, i was the girl who was watching her older sisters lie to our mom about them not having sex when they were both sluts! I am a christian and believe in waiting (I didn't sadly and i regret it deeply.) But they didn't care! I had no idea what to do but i did end up telling my mom what i knew even thought i felt like a tattle tail it was for the best they lived at home and they were having sex under the same roof that my parents are under! Creepy! Tell your parents your doing whats best for them.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	Do not go to your parents over this.<br>  <br>  It's normal for the 17 year old to be having sex, 14 is a little young....but then again I know of girls who we're having their first kid at 14.<br>  You can preach to them as much as you want...but you can't force your beliefs on them. If they want to have sex, they're going to regardless of what someone else thinks about it. Sorry, but that's how it is. At least they're using protection.|`|OHfZFR31aa	The 17 year old is legal and if she has a boyfriend then I don't see a problem unless she's sleeping around. But the 14 year old is way to young to be having sex - she is emotionally and physically immature and is probably just being used by guys. And she also has to know that her boyfriend would get arrested for sleeping with her - and does she reallly want to be responsible for him going to jail.|`|yV373JUiaa	okay why is it your place to tell your parents something as personal and embarrassing as that?<br>  <br>  If my sister had told my parents that I was no longer a virgin before I decided to I would have cut her out of my life. <br>  <br>  Let them know how to be protected and that they can come to you for help anytime. Just because their veiws on sex do not match your religious belief is not a reason to step in as a tattle tale.|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	You cant stop them from having sex, just warn them the dangers of pregnancy and STD's and they shall be fine. They must learn from their mistakes thats the only way im afraid.|`|7KJcMpl9aa	You should tell.<br>  <br>  Imagine if one gets pregnant, won't you wish you had said something?|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	That's such a tricky situation.  I encountered it 2 years ago with my younger sister.  In the end, I did end up telling my mother, but made her promise to not let my little sister know that I told her.  She confronted her, and told her she'd heard from reliable sources that she was having sex. Under the pressure my sis broke down and admitted it.  She asked my mother if I had told her and my mother (not wanting to lie) just said "What!  She knew about this!"  and then pretended to be mad at me over it for several weeks.  It worked great.  I no longer felt the burden of responsibility for her actions (don't know why I felt like that in the first place, but I did)  and it was great to know I wasn't keeping anything from my mother anymore.  But even better I kept my relationship with my sister healthy and earned even more of my mother's trust and respect because she knew how hard it was for me to "betray" my sister like that.
P0Fjh59Eaa	Relax as best as you can...constantly wondering about it can actually delay it! sounds wonky, but you wouldn't believe how many times i did the "OMG am i pregnant dance" for the required 3-5 mins around the test stick! lol<br>   <br>  try to put it out of your mind for a day, then re-test and see what happens. it could very well be just nervous hormones stopping your period. i've had that happen dozens of times.|`|AQvBQHy4aa	i dont think you have morning sickness this early into a pregnancy but i think you should wait a week or two and if you still havnt had your period take the test again<br>  hope it works out ok<br>  xxx|`|WWfL5tMvaa	This is what happened to me last month. I tracked my ovulation and tried everything. my period was late 3 days and i got a negative pregnancy test but when the period didn't show up i thought maybe it is a false negative Till I got my period and things collapsed so yeah relax and take it easy and if it didn't work this time ( hope it will work) then keep up and try next month
jVAY9mlOaa	The American Academy of Family Physicians says you're fine, although a study has linked dental x-rays while pregnant to an inceased chance of having a low birth weight baby.  The American Dental Association says you should be ok too.  Dr. Greene says that 1 out of every 10 pregnant women end up getting dental x-rays while pregnant, although he also points out the study that showed a greater risk of low birth weight in babies.  Overall, I think you should be just fine after reading what the major medical organizations had to say about it.|`|fRsOmKaMaa	no it doesnt but now you are pregnant you should go every 3 months as your body produces chemical which stops your body fighting placque.  i went when i was about 7 months pregnant and was shocked how my teeth were totally plaqued up!  i was private but asked my dentist and hes happy to treat me on nhs whilst pregnant.|`|7oPZbdnEaa	i wouldn't worry about.  When they to x-rays, they should have covered you up with a lead cover, so you don't get exposed.  But, if your really worried i would contact ur dentist or your dr. and as them.  Congrats!! :)|`|AA11103493	You should be ok, but let your doc know anyway.|`|nFY4lENFaa	no. it's pretty much like an ultrasound of your mouth. <br>  and these days you have to have ultrasounds in order to see how your baby is doing further along in your pregnancy. don't worry about it, but congratulations on your healthy teeth and pregnancy!|`|FelNy3txaa	you should be okay. just don't go out getting xrays all the time :D but no just let your doctor know, and if you are really worried ask them to check. I mean at least they can give you a piece of mind.|`|m8kYw6Pjaa	dont worry 2 much be careful now u know u r preggers but the baby is very well protected i would'nt worry 2 much as that alone could harm the baby i would just say take ur time n enjoy x x x|`|ZkMmuuKjaa	no dental x-rays don't go near the baby its a very narrow beam of light (yes xrays are a kind of light.) and it only goes in your jaws.<br>  <br>  your pregnancy will not be affected by this|`|trWeSYruaa	as long as you had the lead jacket your fine|`|bxlYleZkaa	The xray will only be of your head/jaw anyway, not of your abdomen.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	No not at all.<br>  Modern day xrays are very safe.

No creo que estes embarazada, creo que estas nerviosa. Seria bueno que te hicieras la prueba, no sale tanto y es algo reservado que podes hacer sola.Me parece lindo el gesto de entusiasmo tu novio, pero no olvides que es tu cuerpo, y si alguien queda luego con el bebe, esa seras tu, por mas entusiasmo que haya ahora. <br>  Seria bueno que consideres la posibilidad de tomar pastillas, porque estar tan desrregulada hormonalmente no es bueno, el ciclo menstrual tiene una razon de ser, y si estas a los saltos, te puede traer otras complicaciones. Te suguiero que vayas al ginecologo despues de pasado este susto y le expliques que queres tomar pastillas, el sabra que preguntas hacerte para recomendarte la marca y la carga hormonal adecuadas para que las tomes. hay de todo, algunas son super suaves, es un mito que engordan. Tambien podes consultar por los parches. Si no estas pensando seriamente en tener bebes ahora, trata de disfrutar del sexo sin estos sustos y nervios, porque es al pedo y la verdad que con todo lo que hay no tenes necesidad, de estar sintiendote asi.

El natural me dolio mucho pero cuando nacio mi bebe es un sentimiento tan hermoso que vale la pena el sufrimiento, el segundo fue cesarea y  me durmieron completamente. Me desperte desorientada, mareada, y con muchos malestares, tantos que nisiquiera pude dar pecho a mi bebe. <br>  <br>  El tercero fue el mejor, ya que me hicieron la cesarea, pero solo me durmieron de la cintura para abajo, y pude estan conciente de cuando nacio mi bebe, tan lindo y el dolor fue menos que el de cuando me durmieron completa. <br>  <br>  De todos modos te deseo mucha suerte y muchas felicidades, ser mama es lo mas increible en este mundo|`|308a6000091cc2444a47d812ad2bc1d9aa	mira es mucho mejor parto natural a los 7 dias se te fue todo .la cesarea te tarda el dolor 3 meses y tenes q andar fajada es feo pero el bb no sufre nada|`|62peJdiiaa	100% parto natura. La recuperación de una cesárea es mucho más larga y dolorosa que el parto natural, no olvides que es una operación mayor. Aun que tu embarazo ya está bastante avanzado, te recomiendo contactes con instructoras para partos psicoprofilácticos, ellas te orientaran mucho mejor (si quieres te puedo recomendar a alguien). La cesárea es una técnica maravillosa para cuando realmente se necesita, lamentablemente a los doctores que ven a sus pacientes como clientes $$$ prefieren las cesarías por que cobran más, en más raído y se puede programar en una agenda, todo lo contrario del parto natural en donde el bebe decide cuando llegar al mundo. Recuerda es 100% mejor un parto natural, pero si la situación es de emergencia y realmente lo amerita, que maravilla que exista.

Tranquila que ambos métodos te van a dar la felicidad máxima.|`|Y16Krx8Oaa	Hola, te voy a hablar de mi punto de vista particular, yo como madre la verdad nunca tuve la fijación de que mi parto fuera  natural o cesarea, sino que fuera lo mejor para el bb, en mi caso a las 40 sem (el periodo vencido) me dijo el dr que mi bb estaba en posición, pero no habia encajado, asi que nunca tuve ninguna contracción, el medico me pregunto si queria esperar a unos dias mas 41-42 semanas es lo maximo que se espera, y yo le pregunte que era lo mejor, y me dijo que pudiera ser que mientras se espera pudiera haber una complicacion asi que mi bb nacio por cesarea...<br>  <br>  Ahora, el parto natural puede tardar muy poco o muchisimas horas, con dolor, pero cuando sale el bb ya no se siente mas dolor... y obviamente me imagino que debe ser una super experiencia.... pero en mi caso no se pudo<br>  <br>  El parto por cesarea, entre a las 8 al quirofano y  estuve despierta cuando lo sacaron a las 9 de la ma?ana, lo vi lo limpiaron y a mi ya me terminarón de cerrar.... son 3 o 4 dias que realmente duele para que voy a mentir, mi nene salio sonrojado, no traia la carita hinchada (esto pasa cuando es natural porque pasan por un canal muy angosto) asi que mira <br>  <br>  yo si me vuelven a preguntar por el medico si dios quiere cuando encargue otro como q uiere que sea natural o cesarea le voy a decir<br>  <br>  que venga como dios quiera ;)<br>  <br>  p.d. espero no haberte aburrido|`|d6OhA54kaa	Yo tuve a mis dos hijos por parto natural, pero elegí aplicarme la anestasia peridural. La recominedo!!!! Sufrí los dolores de las contracciones pero desaparecieron totalmente apenas me dieron la anestesia. Creo que no se puede elegir, si todo va bien el parto será natural y si no será cesárea, lo importante es que no haya riesgo para el bebé. El problema es que ahora los hospitales y las clínicas realizan muchas cesáreas innecesarias para cobrar la operación a la obra social. Ya no saben qué más inventar para robar, un desastre. Que todo te salga bien, te mando un saludo!.|`|q4uRZmlcaa	deberías sentir el dolor de ser madre...... a que sabrosos dolores. hay un vínculo más amoroso con el bb hacía la madre y viceversa ya que nace por donde se metió jejej así lo decidió la naturaleza. pero si por causas de fuerza mayor no se pudiese, será mejor que te programen a una cesárea para evitar riesgos.<br>  saluditos y suerte|`|sABWT45Caa	Lo que sea conveniente para que vos y tu bebé estén bien. Muchísima suerte!!|`|s172QYxWaa	lo menos traumante para ti es por cesarea se sufre menos... si dices que tu bebe no se decide a acomodarse es mejor esta opcion porque si te arriesgas a tenerlo normal tú tendras los dolores que son horribles y probablemente tu ni?o no se acomode y al final te tengan que hacer la operacion y tu bebe lleva riesgo de padecer sufrimiento fetal... piensalo bien, la cesarea ofrece muchas ventajas... tu  hijo y tu estan mas seguros...|`|tRuGWBGCaa	Cesarea.. es mejor :)|`|85d8b0dcd1fbfa3019be16a8d57ad641aa	SOLO EL BEBE SABRA QUE HARA EN ESTE TIEMPO QUE LE QUEDA, TU TRANQUILA!<br>  <br>  MIS 2 PARTOS FUERON NATURALES Y ME PARECIERON EXCELENTES.|`|6837a00a5804e74f1d009fed225bfe37aa	No te  aflijas  por eso.

En la cesarea la recuperación es muy tardada de 15 a 20 días, según responda tu cuerpo para sanar heridas, y ésta va a darte mucha lata pues esta en una zona de mucho esfuerzo para casi cualquier movimiento, si es por salud del bebé ni hablar, pero yo prefiero dar un grito que como unos treinta!!!!!|`|FurjMChqaa	cesarea definitivamente para mi es lo mejor|`|jm6bt1slaa	Cesarea....es menos doloroso ... eso creo.... surte y felicidades

tLggzW4Eaa	i may need a little bit more info, such as the date of ur last menstrual period, and the date u saw spotting.  Has the spotting stopped, or has it been like a period. Do u feel tired,nauseus, sleepy. Do u have minor cramping in your lower abdomen?  See if u can add some more details,and in the meantime, take another pregnancy test.  <br>  All the best!|`|7aaaa4687fec8d3e7857d9ba2555c4dfaa	Sounds like you may be pregnant.  I had the same light bleeding with both of my pregnancies .. only lasted a couple days, if that, and I also had implantation cramping, which I mistook for regular period cramps.  Take another test, hon.  Good luck!|`|c691dde2b8d05cf6b1522ab67f8f5568aa	Take another test.|`|I9JZxbFRaa	you should take another test, because you can be pregnant and still get your period, i did the first 4 month with mine. and also if your stressed out and thinking you might be it can cause your period to be late and even cause preg. like symptoms. but take a deep breath and hopefully things will end up the way you want it pregnant or not|`|ORQeaRpUaa	Could be pregnancy, but, usually that would start when your period was due, not late.  BEST advice, take a second test, like the other gal said.  Might just be stress from worrying thats making it light.|`|UaKeW6bCaa	Sweetie if this is not normal for you and you have no normal period, get another test:)
7dac9dcb7432836cd4fe00886c458343aa	This does not happen immediately. It takes a few weeks and will usually start right around the time your next period is due.|`|v0BvbOOSaa	You usually start having pregnancy symptoms around the time your period is due. This is about 2 weeks or so after the baby has been conceived. Sometimes, you might mistake early pregnancy symptoms for pre-menstrual symptoms.|`|3d64ca20752d0e6a82280327c07f2223aa	you will have the symptoms around 5th week. the main symptoms are tired, not wanting to eat, sometimes feeling nauseated in the morning and mainly u would want to sleep all the time.|`|6059b1abd93af145f0d446106fcd6da4aa	Hi Hannah,<br>  <br>  No, it takes a few weeks for the signs of pregnancy to start showing. Most most women that is usually around 4-6 weeks pregnant. The only way to know you are pregnant any earlier than 4 weeks is by a blood test.|`|RTVRXsyxaa	no actually having long sex n u can say dailly sex sperm enters de  ovum n then ova u will *** to know after 3 to 4 days latter<br>  weather u r prgnant or not|`|rGgPXA1Uaa	Hi , u will not feel u r pregnanant untill 4 - 6 weeks. u can check urine test at ur home  ( when ur next date is due ).

I had the same issue before.  You can order an ultra sound from you doctor to be on the safe side.  Just let him know that you have some concerns, and that an ultra sound is wanted.  Hopefully everthing will be fine, I'm sure it is.  Good luck.|`|nQhDrfblaa	How old are you?  If you are in your teens/ early twenties, yes, it's normal.  Young mothers tend to have low birth weight babies.|`|6aX2j0Slaa	I'm 23 weeks and u can barely notice my stomach lol..i even got worried and got an ultrasound done..they said the baby is normal and has enough space still...|`|AA11337544	Completely. <br>  <br>  It depends on so many things. Many larger women don't have hard bellies until they are farther along. It also depends on if this is your first as many women don't get very big with their first pregnancy because the uterus has never grown that large before. I wouldn't worry about it. <br>  <br>  I'm an average size - a 10 before I became pregnant - and my belly still isn't fully hard and I'm 34 weeks! It also depends on how you're carrying. I'm carrying low and the top part of my tummy is harder than the lower part. I've heard that if you are carrying high, your belly gets harder faster.<br>  <br>  Son't worry about it! Congratulations!|`|VoLARPJraa	yep, every woman & every pregnancy is different. Dont worry hunny
eECytyckaa	I'm pretty sure that every area has daycare for teen moms. she needs to go talk to the nurse or guidance counselor at school they will be able to put her in touch with the programs. or if school is out in that area her Dr or the health department should be able to help.|`|zcvJhlRQaa	She should contact social services, planned parenthood, or a right to life group, all 3 of those will be able to help her or know of other organizations that can help|`|95bbdc287f43070561207483135ceec9aa	I am 16 an dI have a daughter and Am still In high school Going to the 11th All she has to do is have confidence and talk to the schools guidance cousler about parenting classes at the school....there is nothing wrong with being a teenage mother!!!|`|Ckzn5hX4aa	there should be some kinda of state funds for pregnant teens. she should be able to get help with paying for a daycare or what about the baby's father and his family, maybe they could help or her parents even it isn't gonna be easy trust me i know Ive been through it before|`|cXYlfQ94aa	I am sixteen, I live in Virginia, and my boyfriend and I have a three year old daughter and a new baby girl.

09RBb1pZaa	There are a lot of stores that buy good quality used clothing!!!  Also, you could donate them to a local church.

TArohYRiaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I don't think you are pregnant, but taking antibiotics can cause the pill to be less effective, which may be causing you to spot.  The brighter blood sounds like normal menstrual flow and the brown color is older blood which may indicate you are  about to stop bleeding. Try taking midol or tylenol as directed for the cramping.  If you continue to have these problems please talk to your doctor or go to your local emergency room.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Best wishes to you.|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	buy a test.  If neg. then most likely ur not pregnant|`|0FSdu1Hlaa	Nope, just your period.  For future reference, please use a condom!  Kindof a no-brainer.|`|AA11329892	It sounds like you are having your period, thus, you aren't pregnant.|`|AMI4Fqrpaa	it takes roughly 72 hours to even get pregnant so i wouldnt affect this period it would be the next sweety...<br>  it may just be the antibiotics making you spot... just stop stressing (you body can tell when your stressed about something and can even fake you into believing your pregnant) next week go take a test it will be more accurate... next time get "plan b". you can get it from any pharmacy for free you just have to ask and you have up to 72 hourd to take it.<br>  stay safe! and good luck!|`|YXagKORqaa	If.   you are new to having sex , it may be that the spotting is from the tear of the hymen .you said you had unprotected sex on Sunday it would be to early to tell I wouldnt pannic. if you are worried your GP is the one to help you.|`|ZGXc5OH9aa	yes, brownish colored Period blood in replace of the normal color is a very Good sign of being pregnant, espicially on and off period. your medication can be messing with you birthcontrol pills and making them less efficient. Wait two weeks and take a urine home pregnancy test, if it says negative and you still haven't came on your period wait another week and take it again. After that just go to the cliniq for a  more efficient accurate Blood Pregnancy test|`|dPLuiZs7aa	Just buy a test....
YllMlLdhaa	well any time you have unprotected sex you are risking getting pregnant or even worse maybe an std<br>  why don't you teens ever learn to be careful<br>  your going to have to wait till you miss your period before you can even test<br>  in future please use protection and if you don't have any then no sex|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Next time, you tell your b/f...no glove, no love. (condom) If you aren't pregnant now, let this be a lesson to BOTH of you. You're way too young to be having sex because you seem to think you're having pregnancy symptoms already. Sit down with your mother or a female adult, whom you trust, & have that "birds & bees" talk that you should have had with your mom a long time ago.|`|781a5664d227c5b82107f81ea02e2c58aa	Just wait until your period. If it doesn't come then take a test. Thats the only way you will know. But these feelings may be you doing it to yourself. Thinking your pregnant so bringing on these feelings. <br>  <br>  Hope it works out for the best!|`|942a708204289df3b7927c55a8ecd741aa	well a lot of the symptoms your describing are probably caused not only by stress..not only mental, but stress on your body...However, can you be pregnant..sure there is always a chance for that when ever you have unprotected sex...however there is only a small window of time each month that a woman can get pregnant..that is the few days around your time of ovulation. Please keep in mind that a mans sperm can live inside of you for up to 3 days...and all it takes one little sperm to do the job...|`|CSh2eEWxaa	uh one NOOOO two R U AN IDIOT three go crack a bible open intstead.

USE A CONDOM!!! ARE YOU STUPID!|`|LNferYb7aa	you're an ignorant little girl that should be having sex. you can't tell after an hour if your pregnant. you'll have to wait and see if you'll have a missed period.|`|zt6gbaesaa	you wont know an hour after having sex. lol

dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Try to fine a name that you and the father loves<br>  That's the best you could do<br>  <br>  It's not as easy as it sound.  It took 8 months for my husband and I agree on a name we both love, and went with our last name<br>  <br>  I like having the first name go well with the last|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	It is a tough decision. First we pick out a list of names we like (me and hubby) and then we also try and think about the kind of name it is... how hard to spell, or if it's too weird or not... the name.... <br>  It's hard... because then if you ask around ppl would say ohh no I hate it and maybe you loved it! so it's tough... thank goodness there'are 9 mos to think about it!!<br>  I particularly like traditional, classic names, also I think about my kid as an adult.. like I dont mind calling my child nicknames or whatever but if the name sounds too babyish or childish it puts me off, coz I think of my child 20 yrs from now applying for a job and their name's is whatever -illy.<br>  So I'd rather give my child a full name, and then shorten it, and choose how to be called when he/she is older. <br>  That is in MY opinion :)|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	The name does matter some. How far do you think someone will go career wise with a name like Shaniqua (Sha-nee-kwa) or Roseanne Barr's son's name Buck Naked. (No offense to any Shaniqua's btw, just a name I picked) They will have more hurdles to jump through and will have to prove themselves more than a Dave, Mike or Mary. For myself I said names I liked out loud and  thought of something that is cute for a small child, and still appropriate for other stages in life. I thought of any nicknames that can be made from the names, good and bad and just went with the ones that felt right. |`|hparYLb1aa	It is a very, very big decision!  But I think no matter what the name, you grow to like/know the person who has it.  I think that as long as you pick a name that isn't too crazy or weird, then you will grow to love it (but you should definitely pick a name you love anyways!)  When my parents named my sister Caitlyn I hated the name, but now I think it is so cute and I love it!  Well, good luck with everything!|`|8uauS9aAaa	Sometimes when the baby is born and you see him/her for the 1st time you just know that the name fits. It's very hard to pick out a name. It took forever for us it seemed. Even after we picked it I wasn't 100% until I saw him, then I knew. It's weird.|`|HwlBgOEraa	It's a thing you just know, like when you find the perfect wedding dress. A trick: Introduce yourself as the name you are planning to a stranger. If the name just doesn't sound right, then it probably isn't.
hh892gJfaa	Yes, it's nice. She can be called Frankie for short (especially if she's a tomboy) If she's girly then she can use the full name and sound really pretty.|`|dfQU2Copaa	It's nice......Are you picking out names for a baby? if so it would be ok|`|cn2rvsdOaa	Yes it's gorgeous!!!|`|VcFAjLCNaa	It's lovely.|`|ByWRzuuraa	I absolutely HATE it.<br>  SO much.<br>  I really do.<br>  It sounds horrible.<br>  xxxxx|`|XR7E8I5Faa	I love that name.|`|FL67UPPHaa	No, but that's just because of the people I know with that name. My cousin is called Francesca and she's very high maintenance and materialistic, as was a woman I used to work with. It makes me think of a blonde, attractive but bimbo type girl. <br>  <br>  Also, it usually gets shortened to Fran or Frankie, which sound masculine.|`|1xggHtgXaa	It's cute, but sounds sort of harsh at the same time. I think of a chesty Italian seductress when I hear that name. It's been overused on soap operas...
HN9twtQlaa	It's great that you want to give your child a more formal name instead of just a short nickname. It provides so many more name options as your child grows into adulthood, which is a great. =]<br>  <br>  Anastasia is a real stretch, as is the name Alexis. I would use the nicknames Ana, Nasty, Stasia or Stacy for an Anastasia... and the nicknames Ally, Alex, Lexis or Lexie for an Alexis. You might want to mull over these more natural nicknames, just to see if there are any you don't care for. <br>  <br>  What about the name Beatrice? I know that some people think that it is too 'old fashioned' but it really is a beautiful name. The nicknames Bea and Tress (which could very easily be shortened to Tess) are adorable. Besides, Beatrice is a name that sounds great with Isabelle, and it has so many fantastic literary associations (e.g. Dante's 'Inferno' and Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing'). Additionally, it's a name that has been used by royalty, which demonstrates what a timeless classic this name is. <br>  <br>  You could do the whole rhyming nickname thing, like they did in the middle ages... you know, Robert became Rob became Hob became Bob; Mary became Molly became Polly etc. You could use a name like Jessica or Jacinta (with the English pronunciation), and the nickname Jess could transform into Tess. Or you could transform the nickname Tas (e.g. from names like Tamsin or Tasmin) into Tess. You could also use the nickname Tess for Teodora, although I don't really think that name is your style. <br>  <br>  Just remember that some of the best nicknames, and the ones that stick, often have nothing to do with a persons first name. I've been called 'Figs' for years by my family and friends, and it sounds nothing like my first name (Lauren). You might want to simply choose a name that you love and use Tess as a nickname anyway. <br>  <br>  Here are some names that I think sound good with Isabelle (aside from Beatrice): Susanna, Sophie, Marion, Adelina, Ava, Hannah, Abigail, Clementine, Charlotte, Madeleine, Amelie, Gabrielle, Mireille, Amandine, Juliet, Giselle, Carolina, Violet or Amelia. |`|7lpjlcqCaa	What about Tessie?  You could name her Tessie Faith?  I like Anastasia a lot better than Alexis, but that's because I knew a really conceited guy named Alex who named his daughter Alexis and she turned out to be just as obnoxious as he was.  Then again,  you could name her Alexis and have the most beautiful, sweet little baby girl who could save the name from all of that!  <br>  <br>  I think that Isabelle and Anastasia compliment each other very well.  |`|3bdb0c9980b9d24f0f88e2e1a0acfe3eaa	Why are you thinking about naming your child on the principle of a nickname? Your child may never get called this nickname anyway, which would be wasting your time. But, it's a good idea not to call her Tess, because my name is a nickname from Kimberly, and I hate it.<br>  <br>  Funny thing is I was thinking about where people got Tess from, I think Therese or Theresa is better.|`|9BlHckFkaa	Both names are very pretty but I like Alexis better. You could also have Tessa, or Teresa be your daughter's middle name, so going by the nickname Tess wouldn't be as much of a stretch. Alexis Teresa is a lovely combination.|`|ByWRzuuraa	Wow Alexis is stunning.<br>  Anastacia isn't nice at all. <br>  Especially not for when she turns 15/16.<br>  My friend's full name is Contessa.<br>  I personally hate that name :)<br>  Alexis is gorgeous believe me xxx|`|4CyhY6Q1aa	erm... it could work and i do think Isabelle and Alexis works together.. it wouldnt be a natural nickname for Alexis...<br>  <br>  i dont have any suggestions either sorry... |`|WQRRBFGBaa	I hate Anastasia.<br>  And you could just call her Tess. She doesn't have to use that only as a nickname, if you like it enough use it.|`|FvonW0Gmaa	What about Tessaly. ??  I don't know how to spell it properly but I think it is very pretty.  Isabelle and Tessally.  |`|wRnnxg5saa	i think tessa is great but a good nickname for anastasia is Annie<br>  i do Like Alexis|`|lVXE8gxaaa	Tessanthia |`|JsNi1oSHaa	i like alex better and i do mean for a girl|`|plKnGowkaa	I see Alexis as being just as chav as Stacy, sorry. I prefer Anastasia.<br>  <br>  I don't think nicknames have to be immediately obvious (eg. I love Lily as a nickname for Elisabeth), but I think that a nickname like Tess would work best if the name had an obvious -ess sound or at least a single t in the name. Alexis doesn't fit either of these, so I'm giving it a no.<br>  <br>  Maybe...<br>  <br>  Celeste<br>  Estelle<br>  Estella<br>  Alessandra<br>  Jessamine<br>  Vanessa<br>  <br>  or maybe Therese/Terese as an alternative to Theresa/Teresa?<br>  <br>  I would love to meet an Estella nicknamed Tess. So sweet.<br>  |`|1e7f68ee6a0d79eda6c821e9a33f6438aa	I love the name Alexis! And Tess would be a cute nickname!<br>  <br>  Alexis Aura<br>  Anastasia Aura is also very pretty!<br>  <br>  also like:<br>  Alexis Morgan<br>  Anastasia Elise|`|TCpPdqcBaa	I LOVE the name Alexis! I don't think that the nickname necessarily has to be directly related to her first name, and if you want her to be named Alexis and go by Tess, then I say go for it.|`|JGZfcytYaa	I like Anastasia.  I actually know a girl who shortens it to Tasha, so Tess shouldn't be a problem.  I like the name Alexis, but I think the only problem is that there's no T in it.  On BabyNames.com I found the name Tessica, but I think that's a little on the odd side.  But I think I prefer Anastasia.  How about naming her Anastasia Alexis?|`|vGxipYJnaa	Anastasia is a gorgeous name - and while Tess is a bit of a stretch it could still work. Plus, I think Isabelle and Anastasia sound better together as siblings.<br>  <br>  Alexis is a nice name but can often be seen as "lower end". Anastasia is classic and gorgeous.|`|0wTzlG2haa	Why not just call her Tess? I knew someone in high school who's name was Tess. It wasn't short for anything at all. Alexis often gets shortened to Alex or Lexi...neither of which I like particularly.|`|zbjaBgyEaa	Elsie works for you first dauhter because the "EL" actually appear in the name.  You can hear the "EL" part, so it works.  I knew an Isabelle who went by Elsie.  I don't think it's that far fetched.<br>  <br>  With Alexis I think it's too far a stretch though.  I think it would always confuse people, and I don't think it would catch on so much.  There's no T in the name.  It doesn't really sound a like either.  If she introduced herself as Tes, when I knew her legal name was Alexis, I'd assume she hated her real name.  Or she was playing a game or something.  I just don't think it's close enough. I don't really think it would catch on.<br>  <br>  I'd also say it's about as chavvy as Stacy.  It's not particularly elegant or classy to me.<br>  <br>  Of the two I Anastasia better (by the way, another alternative nickname for Anastasia other than Stacy which is, I agree, chaavy - Anna or Anya (aw-ya) which are pretty).  It's still a bit of the stretch, but I can easily see where the Tess comes from - the Tas part.<br>  <br>  I really love Theresa though.  It's gorgeous.  I don't see anything wrong with that, and it's pretty clearly got the nickname Tess - no question.|`|ablhNL0Maa	I think Alexis and Tess is a very long shot, and doesn't really make sense.<br>  <br>  I met a girl recently named Tessala, she went by Tess. I've also heard of Tessandra but I don't particularly care for that one. |`|2PLxE7dsaa	I like both, but why don't you just call her Tess if you like it. You don't need a long name only to shorten it. I chose Josh for a boy...not Joshua just Josh if that makes sense.<br>  Good Luck|`|lk7iaxqkaa	Tess can be a nickname for Quintessa, very adorable, I think<br>  <br>  EDIT: here is the link: <a href="http://babynames.com/Names/name_display.php?id=5896" rel="nofollow">http://babynames.com/Names/name_display....</a>|`|s5c01qRLaa	I love Alexis!!! Just my opinion, but I think  Tess would be a fine nickname for Alexis. I am not really a fan of Anastasia.|`|NbsBwYDJaa	I absolutely adore the Alexis :)<br>  x|`|ocwIcfzPaa	I much prefer Alexis. <br>  <br>  I love the name Tess too! If we had one her name would be Thirza. |`|pCbzhOrkaa	my cousins name is tess, i like it. You could also name her Anastasia Tess and then you could call her by her middle name?|`|UUysEV0yaa	Why not just call her Tess?<br>  <br>  Short, sweet, pretty.

zHz6FTRNaa	It really depends on how close you intend to get to Matt. If it's just a small thing and will probably pass, then perhaps if you so badly don't want to tell your mum - then don't. You don't have to, though it does tend to enforce a sort of bond and trust between you and your mum.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you would like to get a little close and personal with this guy and maybe even get together with him, I think it would be a good idea. But if you don't want your mum to snowball it on to Matt, then, like many other people who have answered this question, I would advise telling Matt yourself. I think it's pretty safe to say that most guys admire that kind of bravery, it may even better your chances of getting a positive response in return.|`|1thzSbS8aa	Your mom and Debbie probably know already. You kids are pretty easy to read.<br>  <br>  But---No, no, no, no, NO. You do NOT ask moms to arrange dates or even tell boys that you like them.  There isn't a boy in the world who's going to like hearing something like that from his mother. He will see it as pressure. Pressuring a guy doesn't make him like you more, it makes him like you less.<br>  <br>  |`|BEequNDOaa	Talk to Matt, if he feels the same way & you both end up dating, then you tell your Mum :-) <br>  Whats the point in telling her if nothings going to happen<br>  <br>  Good luck . |`|fYav9OdQaa	why dont you just tell matt yourself lol|`|EOixVg5Raa	yeah you have to, if you want to tell her then...tell her! of course on the right time and moment, like if you guys are watching TV or just joking around...i think she'll understand you.

937a39d4420ec205ba27abecf72d8823aa	La menopausia puede comenzar dependiendo de muchas cosas,por ejemplo si te han practicado una histerectomia <br>  total,entras a una menopausia de inmediato,porque te han extirpado tus organos genitales y tu organismo ya no producira mas hormonas.Aparte de otras causas medicas ,<br>  la menopausia puede depender tambien de las condiciones familiares de presentacion de la misma,en algunos casos se puede presentar a los 35 a?os,pero como una premeno-<br>  pausia y eso puede ser hereditario.Generalmente la premenopausia se presenta en las mujeres a los 45 a?os y la menopausia a los 55 o mas.<br>  Segun estudios aquellas mujeres que su ciclo menstrual se inicio muy temprano (menos de 14 a?os),tienen una gran probabilidad de tener cuadros menospausicos mas temprano.<br>  La menopausia se?ala el fin de la fase reproductora en la vida de la mujer.Los niveles hormonales disminuyen a tal punto que la ovulacion y la menstruacion son irregulares y finalmente cesan por completo.La mujer no se encuentra sujeta mas al decaimiento mensual ni al flujo de emociones y malestar fisico.A medida que disminuyen las hormonas femeninas,aumentan  los efectos de la hormona masculina,el androgeno producido en cantidades diminutas por las galndulas suprarrenales.Las mujeres pueden ver una redistribucion de la grasa corpral que se aleja de las caderas y muslos,pasando al estomago y la espalda.Sin los efectos suavizantes del estrogeno,el cabello,la piel y las u?as se pueden tornar secos o quebradizos.Los delicados tejidos vaginales pueden secarse y se irritan con facilidad.Las relaciones sexuales pueden hacerse dolorosas.Disminuye la libido.Durante esta epoca es muy comun experimentar los sudores nocturnos,los arrebatos de calor,la boca ardiente,las ganas de llorar y la sensacion de hormigueo en la piel.Las mujeres corren un mayor riesgo de sufrir un ataque al corazon y de contraer cancer.Se pueden obtener beneficios de la terapia de reemplazo hormonal de los suplementos de vitaminas y minerales,del ejercicio y de una dieta saludable.<br>  <br>  P.D.No te deseperes amiga y tomalo con mucha paciencia.Y cuando te llegue preocupate sobre todo en los suplementos vitaminicos que tienes que tomar,para evitar complicaciones.|`|0cbb0db02547dfed5ee73a49fd679dc7aa	alrededor de los 50, también trae trastornos, nunca nos salvamos las mujeres|`|Gs5Ox7kQaa	La menospausia empieza entre los 42 a los 45 a?os,,,, asi que se?orita tiene que aguantarse porque eso es mas normal que tener hambre...... jajaja,,, enserio ten paciencia ya vas a  llegar pero por favor es algo bueno no malo, pero a ya tuuuuu!!!!......=D yo apenas tengo 16 y no me quejo!!!! jjaajaj..........!!!!<br>  Causa molestias es cierto pero acostumbrada deberias de estar ya tienes 34 a?os, y una ni?a de 12 o 14 o de 17 a?os no se quejan, ni porque acaban de empezar y tu que tienes mas de 10 a?os con eso, no es posible que no hayas acostumbrado de una vezzzz!!!! enserio....

XFrNAEzIaa	hola tengo 18 a?os y tengo relaciones con mi novio pero cuidandome..Usamos preservativos no por enfermedades de transmision sexual, ya q se q mi pareja no tiene y estoy completamente segura de q me es fiel, sino por el embarazo..<br>  No son todos los adolecentes los q no se cuidan, aunq te digo q  son bastantes..Yo soy de argentina, cap fed, de un nivel de clase social medio y de un buen colegio..pero tenia mis compa?eras y amigas q era para matarlas, no se cuidaban por q en un punto no estaban completamente informadas y el otro, que me parece q se lleva toda la culpa, es por la calentura..son capaces de si no tienen preservativos tener relaciones igual :S, y otra es por q obvaimente con el preservativo sienten menos y priman en mayor placer y sensacion..Es una lastima q eso lo concideren en el momento mas importante q su futuro..<br>  <br>  Y no es para enojarse en ningun punto...<br>  <br>  Suerte ;)|`|3nqmj9JGaa	yo soy un adolescente "responsable" creo jaja, pero el problema en esta edad es que hay curiosidad por sentir cosas nuevas pero tal vez muchas veces se tiene el condon en situacione socntroladas pero en las que no, en la que salen de repente(aunque se escuche mal)el muchacho a la chava se deja llevar por la misma satisfacción del cuerpo y eso fisiologicamente, el chavo se deja llevar, pero si los padres habalran con los hijos sobre eso desde que entran a la secundaria cuando tienen 10 u 11 a?os se pueden ir quitando sus dudas pero muchas vez los padre les da pena hablar con sus hijos de eso, pero asi es. es dificil de explicar, es una edad de confusion es como cuando una mujer se mide la ropa aunque no tenga dinero pero se la mide solo para ver como se ve en su cuerpo, sale bye y suerte..|`|JH4kJwS3aa	hola los adolescentes saben y estan muy informados que deben cuidarse para prevenir enbarazon no deseados y enfermedades! pero cuando estan con el chico o chica! se olvidan y no piensan que un descuido puede ser fatal!|`|OIgQHm61aa	hola. mira no es que no tengan dinero para condones solo que la juventud de hoy en dia les gusta desafiar las cosas y diafrutar del placer dicen que cuando usan condon no se siente igual que sin condon y cuando estan en plena accion el condon sale sobrando|`|q1cywh66aa	es simple , algunos chicos lo hacen por hacerlo ,ya no tiene el sentido del amor para algunos, generalmente es sexo casual y quieren conocer y lo peor es  por que son irresponsables es ahí el momento donde quedan embarazadas las  chicas. y creo que no se cuidan por que en el momento no se detienen para decir : " hey tengo que cuidarme!!". solo van y lo hacen .<br>  también creo que pasa por un tema de poca comunicación con los padres , especialmente para las chicas, seguramente no le es fácil decirles o hablarles de esos temas , o no tienen unos padres comprensivos que los guíen , por que creo que es mas valerosa la opinión de un padre a un amigo ( generalmente la de ellos es la mas errada) . creo que lo mas importante es comunicarse con ellos .<br>  <br>  eso :D|`|xMrWa53caa	Mira yo aveces me pregutno lo mismo que tu pero a esa edad no les importa creen que lo saben todo o que todo lo pueden y entre los hombre que con cuantas mas mujeres se acuesten mas fregones son ellos y hay entre  algunas muchachas que tmb son asi mas cuando estan en fiestas y tomando no saben todo les vale. ahorita tengo un problema bueno en realidad no lo es yo ya me voy a casar y pues nadamas es tenido initmidad con mi futuro esposo, lo hice sin proteccion hace dias y la verdad no se si voy a que dar embarazada peroestoy muy contenta pues se lo que quiero, Los adolesentes todavia estan en esa etapa de que si les dices algo se enojan porque simpre creen ke estan bien a un sabiendo que casi la mayoria de las personas mayores estan correctas|`|yASnpob6aa	no me enojo yo creo a ti te paso y no quieres ke a las de mas chavas les pase si o no?

Pero bueno, creo que ya aprendi de unos sustos que me pegue y por lo menos ya hace rato que no lo hago sin proteccion. Igual tambien me pegue varios sustos por fallas del condon. Me gusto tu pregunta, me hace pensar.  Adios|`|pFHkwQn7aa	no se.. mi novio dice que no es lo mismo. ( yo soy virgen )<br>  pero no importa, porque ya le dije que sin proteccion no habra accion xD jajaja saludos ^^|`|v3A4AzUdaa	puede ser porque no se siente lo mismo, o les da verguenza comprar o piensan k a ellos no les pazara eso..<br>  <br>  saludos<br>  <br>  y pues eyos en ese momento no piensan en como cuidarse

Board games, read or something fun outside.  Be creative.  They may disapprove at first because that isn't what they are used to.  <br>  <br>  Play fun games that will help you to know them better.  Decide on a fun prize or something that will make it worth their time.<br>  <br>  If they really won't put the games down, catch up on a good book, write a thank you card/letter to someone who has made a difference in your life, or things you need to get done that day or tomorrow.|`|5jsMY4RIaa	Just let them play and read a book or something. Or ask if you can play with them. Sounds like an easy job to me.

cPn8cejzaa	Yes because nobody will love or care for a child like his or her mother will.  (I'm talking about a "normal" situation of course, I know there are exceptions, unfortunately).  Your child will grow up quickly and you can't replace those years.  there are always playdates for socialization and part time preschool too.  But before a child is three they don't really NEED to be playing with other kids necessarily.  Young kids just need their mommies.  A three though the socialization should begin if it hasn't already.  And I think part time preschool is an awesome idea at 3 and 4.|`|da1dcaeaa6d5a578338ee81a7e6ea26faa	children always do better with a stay at home mom, my son is five and according to public school you son can start kindergarden , possibly first grade.lol.  for socialization take him to the park, the fun place at mcdonalds, check you schools and local paper for single parent get togethers, this will all help feed that need. I have twins and they ALWAYS want sone one else to play with, even after they have been at school all day, so it really doesnt matter how much he is with other children he will always want more. as long as he gets some he should do great, but to answer your question<br>  <br>  YES HE IS!|`|5PPb6Dg5aa	You know I am a stay at home mom. I really don't think it is fair to say which is better. It really is who you are to your children and how focused you are on them. It sounds like you have been focused on your child and have thought it through and now you are trying to talk yourself into it. The idea really does sound like something the both of you could benefit from.|`|AA12255511	I work in a daycare and I can tell you right now that he isn't going to be going for socialization, you might want to try a play group for that one. <br>  Kids in a daycare, look at the teacher-child ratio ... its not all that okay. I work with the twos' and we're 1 teacher to 8 kids,etc. These kids aren't having fun with each other but more of "surviving", they are thrown into a large group of children with just two adults. <br>  Your son is older and won't be as needy as a younger child but still, don't think his personal needs are being met %100 in any child care center. No matter the heart of the providers there just isn't enough opportunity to give that to each child when you have sometimes over 20 and just 2 teachers. <br>  <br>  But listen, your not a bad mother for putting him in a daycare center. Sometimes you need to choose one better over another, both being equal worth. You need to provide for your son and I strongly encourage you to do this. I wouldn't live with your mother, you don't need to be under the rule of someone else. It seems like an easy way but its probably not the best way. <br>  <br>  Your being a great mom!|`|uVaown7Xaa	I really think it depends on the Mom, some stay at home moms are miserable and not good caretakers and it would be better off if they went to work.<br>  some working moms don't put motherhood as their top priority like they should.<br>  there is an extreme for everything.<br>  i am a stay at home mom and am glad I am. <br>  sorry dont know if that helps at all.|`|vF5fTwMjaa	children do better with a mom in general. as long as they have a mom, they don't care whether she is stay at home or not. it's up to you!;]
qUhntdzvaa	A baby is the biggest blessing in life especially if the timing is wrong.   I know it sounds weird and off but trust me - you'll be stronger for it. You'll make it.  Have it - you'll be gald you did.  Good Luck|`|giKCTfnfaa	before you resort to something as drastic as abortion, wouldn't it just be easier to tell your new boyfriend and ex (especially him).  you have obviously moved on and it's really none of your ex's business about the new man, but he does deserve the right to know you're carrying his child. <br>  <br>  and i'm totally flabbergasted by you saying "i've got to think about whats best for my baby".  having an abortion is best for your baby?  i don't think so. that's what is best for you without any regards to the baby. |`|dmCAiuMGaa	You think what's best for your baby is to kill it?  Or is that what's best for you because you've found yourself in this awkward situation?<br>  <br>  If you really want to think about what's best for your baby, why don't you give it up for adoption?  Give it a chance to live with a family who would truly want and love it.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	i think its completely up 2 u hunni, if u think thats best then no1 can say other wise.<br>  <br>  y dont you discuss it with them both, although i know how hard that would be hunni.<br>  <br>  either way it sup 2 u, im not going to say what i would do asd i think it should be your choice completley xxxx|`|MLgknFlVaa	Either way you choose it is not going to be easy. An abortion does not just make the problem go away. It can haunt you for a long time. You will always wonder....what if. Then when you choose to have your first child you could experiance extreme feelings of guilt. I am only saying this because I read you say you were against it. And what about abortion do you disagree with? Do you disagree with people having them in general, but it is ok for you? You need to think this through. Talk to your parents, your x, and planned parenthood. But at ten weeks you dont have much time....the baby already has arms and legs. I think you might regret it seeing how you have already stated that you are against it. You can still have a good life even if you have a baby this young. Good luck on what ever you decide|`|rC6gL7KOaa	I would have the baby. I would let my ex and the new man know what's going on. If your ex decides to step up and take responsibility, great. If the new man decides to leave you, then it just wasn't meant to be. This situation could turn out a number of different ways. Your ex may decide he doesn't want to be a father and the new man may decide to step up and take responsibility for the child. Either way, this is not going to be easy. The longer you wait, the harder it will be for you. Please don't have an abortion. I'm not 100% against abortions because I believe that certain situations arise in a woman's life where this is the only choice, like in a case of rape or incest. But you had unprotected sex voluntarily and you knew what could happen and you decided to take that chance. At 10 weeks this baby already has a heartbeat, eyes, and ears. I had an abortion at 17 (I'm 23 and married now) then a miscarriage last month. I now realize how precious childbearing is and how blessed we are to be able to carry a baby. I'm  pregnant now again and I pray everyday that nothing goes wrong with my baby. I regret the miscarriage I had when I was young, dumb, and felt like my situation was too complicated to handle. God bless you and I hope you make the right decision. |`|frItAvRhaa	To have an abortion would have to be entirely your decision, I don't know you but it doesn't sound like this would be a decision you would be happy with -you are already calling it your baby hon, I don't know if it'll be the right option for you it won't be easy and doing it without your partners support will be a huge strain. <br>  Why do you think this is the best thing for the baby? Given that you are considering all options you sound mature and sensible why can't you be a mum? |`|AyFlyjp7aa	 think about it this way.  that baby is a PERSON.  He/she will grow up to have personally characteristics and things he/she likes.  Its a human being.  Do you normally hear about people having the babies and regretting it?  NO.  they say they regret the decision but they love their child.  Youre so selfish just to be considering this.|`|GjuRYsITaa	just because your not with the father any more isn't a reason to have a termination what has the child done to deserve that, tell the father your pregnant and see what he says he may want to be a part of the child's life just cause your not together isn't an excuse|`|OPzH4ih0aa	Get an abortion and  move on with your life. Forget about your ex.|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	Can I ask why you think abortion is what is best for your baby?|`|0fd84ba056353594be65eb4771d885ebaa	tell your ex and your new boyfriend|`|DBg0yFSYaa	I'm surprised you can consider abortion when you are referring to it as "my baby". <br>  This is so funny though, because I found out I was pregnant by an ex when I was 15 and my sister had just learned she was pregnant also! Well, I had my baby and its pretty cool that him and his cousin are so close in age. Also, there was this bond created between my sister and I from us being pregnant together (even though we were both pretty crabby a lot of the time). I'm not really trying to sway you. I just wanted to share my decision and let you know that a positive outcome is very possible if you do choose to keep your baby. <br>  You should definitely tell your ex and the new guy you are seeing. There's a pretty good chance the new guy will split. And there's no telling how your ex will react, but I say just tell them and get it over with. |`|mjyzh0z2aa	Well, if I were in your situation, I would keep the baby, I do not believe in ending the life of any person, or animal for that matter, tell both your ex, and your current bf, it is best that they both know, you have to stick with your morals, and do what is best for you, an abortion can be very hard, both mentally and physically, it can do quite abit of dammage, now, i cannot make the decision for you, it is up to you, but, be sure that you think it out carefully, and remember, if you don't want to have an abortion, but do not want to keep the baby, there are people out there who would love to adopt him or her.  relax, and think this out, good luck, and remember, nobody can tell you what to do, it is your choice.|`|ByWRzuuraa	Well firstly, You should tell your ex & not just decide what you yourself wants to do, let him tell you about what he thinks about it aswell, talk it through with him and decide together because it is his child aswell. Tell your new man that your pregnant with your ex's child, maybe he will support you? Just get it out in the open, dont tell your family until you have talked it through with your ex, then you can tell your family your decision. <br>  Good luck, Im sure everything will be okay, I wouldnt personally abort it because like the person above said, its not your childs fault.<br>  xxxx|`|zAKFuGGiaa	I got pregnant with my daughter about a month before my 17th birthday when I was a senior in high school.

My little girl is happy, healthy and smart and I know I am doing everything right! It's not always easy being a teen parent, but at the same time it's not easy being a parent at all...<br>  <br>  If I were in your shoes, I would tell both the father and your new boyfriend, as well as your parents and I would keep the baby. But again, that's just me... |`|102032a885d8fd1bc1a8bd16ac7eb759aa	? think you already know what is best for the situation and the life your in at the moment only you can decide<br>  <br>  This is what you said:<br>  <br>  i think it would be best if i just had an abortion =[ i disagree with it completely but ive got to think about whats best for my baby even if it means i cant stick to my morals.<br>  <br>  what would you do? x|`|WtfzTeE4aa	you need to speak to an adult. your mum or sister or your GP. this isnt an easy decision but i dont think an abortion is the answer. you will regret it for the rest of your life. and you need to tell your ex. it is his baby too, even if you have split up he has a right to know and help you thro which ever road you decide to go down, <br>  good luck/.|`|AA12240329	two years and you never got pregnant.  this baby is a blessing. i would let them both know. maybe you and your ex can work things out.  my sister got pregnant two months after i did and she wanted to abort to but she was scared and afraid but once i found out she felt better about the entire situation. please dont abort the baby. |`|PpXXftTTaa	this happened to my daughter she had the baby he is now 11yrs old. when he was a yr old they got back together now he has 2 brothers 9 and 10 months( a whoops) and they have been happy ever since they are now married. i hope this helps. if it was me i would do just the same as my daughter.|`|H0fXySX9aa	this is what i would do and that is keep the baby,<br>  that is a honest answer i had my first at 18 she is now 5|`|1ybSiMlPaa	first off tell your ex and your new boyfriend. secondly i'm am not at all for abortion. There is always adoption. but you do whatever you think you should do. and good luck.|`|teGBYQuCaa	I wouldn't have an abortion just because Im not with the father anymore. Its not the baby's fault. I think you need to do some more soul searching on this one. |`|RKfeB8Qxaa	Don't have a abortion!! why punish the baby for something you have brought on yourself!!?|`|887473dd6877337cb899156218187fc8aa	If it were me I would stand up be a woman and keep the baby. You laid down and made the baby, therefore you need to keep it. You also need to tell your ex and your current boyfriend. You shouldn't kill an innocent baby just b/c you are not sure, that is totally wrong I think. gl and hope you decide to keep the baby!|`|AA10598625	I am 21. I am a little older than you but I am almost 19 weeks preggo. Had I gotten pregnant when I was 17 I would have definetly kept the baby and would not have thought twice about it. I am still with the father but we are not married. In life, things are going to come up and you just have to take them as they come. Babies are the most precious gift of all, even if they are by total accident. Please don't get an abortion. If you feel you are unable to care for the child there is always adoption. Think about it. I'm sure you'd be a great young mommy.|`|AJuVM7Fnaa	Well if you just started dating a new man and had already finshed with your ex then technically all you have done wrong is not used protection. Or did you cheat on your new man with your ex :-/   ?<br>  "I think it would be best" you really need to think about this its not a decision to make lightly, you need to think about what the future holds and how upset you maybe after the abortion days,weeks, months and years along the line!<br>  Tell your new fella what has happened and what he plans to do if you keep the child or to have an abortion then speak to the father and see how he feels about it. Speaking to someone could help you make the most hardest decision of your life. <br>  <br>  A baby is a special thing, and it is a remarkable feeling to become a mother. Dont just make this decision without thinking through it.<br>  <br>  Think carefully chick!!<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  xxxxx|`|JNfnkFltaa	Whichever path you choose, it's going to hurt, no matter how you sort it out. If I was you, I'd talk to your ex and see what his view is. I'd also talk to your new man, and see what his view is. But remember, no matter what they say or want you to do, you don't have to do it.<br>  Also, talk to your parents or anyone else in your family that you can trust, maybe your sister,  as you're so young. Find out who would be willing to help and support you if you do decide to keep the baby.<br>  From there on, it's your choice. Think about the current place you live in, the amount of money you have, if you'd be willing to give up Friday nights down at the club for your baby. I personally disagree with abortions, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. It depends on the conditions that the baby will be living with.<br>  Having an abortion can haunt you for years, (not trying to put you off) but sometimes it's the best you can do. I had my youngest around your age, and she's five now, and I don't regret keeping her, but you might.<br>  I wish you the best, don't let anyone force you into anything you don't want to do.|`|KXtDd7o4aa	Get an abortion and dont listen to these people telling you its wrong and its murder - ITS NOT!!!<br>  <br>  Its your life and you will live it how you want. You are only 17, this baby is not just a pregnancy thing - Its for the rest of your life and you will want to give it the best up bringing you can! Your not going to do that (no offence) at 17 - Im 20 and i know i would be an awful father just now.<br>  <br>  Bet get an abortion - You dont need to tell your ex and your boyfriend now. Dont beat yourself up about this and go on the pill - Its safer for all of you!<br>  <br>  Stu<br>  xxx|`|YQOT68xFaa	Don't abort, whatever you do. You are against it, you know it is a baby you are carrying....don't do it. You will regret it. What's best for your baby is not to die a grim death, hun, I promise. <br>  <br>  You've made a mistake, and you have a chance to change and fix it. You can either step up and raise this baby and be the best mom you can be, or you can give it up for adoption to a loving couple who will care for it. But don't abort. It won't make things better. <br>  <br>  You need to tell your new boyfriend that you're carrying your ex's baby, and then you have to tell your ex. He deserves to know - it is his child too. But first, tell your family - you will need their love and support. They may be upset at first, but give them time and they will come around.<br>  <br>  You can do this. It's going to be hard, but you can do it!

It's too plain.  You'll already have some sibling rivalry just because it's two girls.  Don't make the name part of it.  Choose a name as pretty as Jennifer (Rachel and Alyssa are my favorites from your list).  Or, instead of Nikki do Nicole or Alicia instead of Alice.  For a boy, don't do the Italian names unless your last name is Italian.  Do consider what the nickname will be when choosing the name.  For example, don't go with Edward if you can't stand someone calling him Eddie.  |`|JQ5M7WChaa	I love all the boy names that you selected to vote.

6GE69BX8aa	Oi, Mony. Tudo bem?<br>  <br>  N?o se preocupe, vc n?o está grávida. Vamos aos fatos:<br>  1- N?o é comprovado que os antibióticos anulam o efeito dos anticoncepcionais. <br>  <br>  2- Sua menstua??o desceu e, pelo que você disse, veio bem vermelha. Quando existe algum sangramento da gravidez, ele acontece aproximadamente 10 dias depois da rela??o sexual, pois é esse o tempo que demora para o óvulo grudar na parede do útero. Esse sangramento n?o se parece nem um pouco com a menstrua??o, é bem mais escuro e tem mais aparência de uma borra de café. Tirando que é algo que vem em uma quantidade muuuuito pequena.<br>  <br>  3- O teste de farmácia deu negativo. Se o sangramento fosse causado pela gravidez, ent?o seu corpo  já teria horm?nios suficientes para serem detectados por um exame de farmácia. Logo, se o teste deu negativo, você n?o poderia estar grávida.<br>  <br>  Sobre o corrimento, podem ser vários motivos.

muTZeGOgaa	This does happen, unfortunately. The odds of getting pregnant with a tubal ligation are 1 in 400. Most failures happen after 4 years because it give the tubes time to grow back, or heal and create an opening.<br>  <br>  The symptoms should be like any normal pregnancy in the beginning. However, 50% of all pregnancies that occur after a tubal are ectopic. Sometimes the egg isn't big enough to make it through an opening, but the sperm are, resulting in a fetus growing inside your tube. In that case, the pregnancy is not salvageable, and the pregnancy will either have to be terminated by means of medication, or if the fetus is too big, with surgery. Ectopic pregnancies if left untreated will result in the death of the mother.<br>  <br>  However, if it is the egg that makes it though, it will simply be like a normal pregnancy, which will result in a perfectly healthy baby.<br>  <br>  If you test pregnant, and have had your tubes tied, you MUST see a doctor immediately to determine where the fetus is. Good luck.|`|4cHPNwflaa	It can happen but is very very rare.  You need to see the doctor pretty quickly and sort this out.|`|2shNWLG6aa	JUST HAVE THE BABY UNTIE THE TUBES. HOPEFULLY IT IS NOT A WINSOR KNOT. SQUARE KNOTS ARE EASIER TO UNTIE.|`|3HzthVcsaa	Yes its possible. Getting your tubes tied is not 100% eeffective.  Yes it is possible to carry the baby but also possible to have an ectopic pregnancy which is dangerous and must be surgically removed. 1/350 women become pregnant after having their tubes tied. Most of the time if you do end up getting pregnant it is a Ectopic pregnancy one and you have to have it ended :( I suggest calling your doctor. Hope this helps.|`|92ccd5c189acd74f59c13b6003f8bdb5aa	If you are pregnant, then your tubes were either not tied or improperly tied.<br>  <br>  The tubes are supposed to be tied and burned.<br>  <br>  Going to the doctor will give you the best advice.|`|ehNzfNw4aa	you should be asking a DR this one|`|6NIrgtROaa	I don't think you can get pregnant with your tubes tied. If you did, hope that the egg was fertilized after the "tied" part so that it can travel to the uterus and implant. Otherwise it would be an etopic pregnancy and you would have to have the baby removed (sorry).|`|8HFuqcRcaa	When I was a kid, my moms friend got pregnant after her tubes were tied. They couldn't figure out how it happened, but nevertheless it did. It's rare, but it can happen.|`|AA11668402	If you have had your tubes tied you are more likely to have a "tubal pregnancy". This is when the baby stays in the tube and grows there instead of the normal pregnancy when the child drops to the uterus. It is possible to have a normal pregnancy after having your tubes tied but the chances are far more likely that you will have a tubal pregnancy. When this happens doctors must remove the baby because it can not grow there and survive and it can very easily cause major damage to the mother and can even be life threatening.<br>  They do have tubal reversal surgery now. These are becoming more popular for women who change their minds and want more children. They are costly though. With this surgery woman can get pregnant naturally and deliver a perfectly healthy baby the good ol' fashion way.|`|fvLKkBLxaa	That actually happened to my mother, and the baby DID die. theres no room to develop in the tubes so I guess thats what happens....It is also dangerous to both the mother AND the baby.|`|mHzlKKKaaa	you can get preg after a tubal (they can come untied)<br>  <br>  my cousin had her tubes tied after her 3rd child and she had her 7th in april 06<br>  <br>  i also know a woman personally that had hers done and had 2 daughters ages 8 & 10 and so hers were tied 8 yrs and she now has 2 sons<br>  <br>  and also when i was about eight mos preg with my daughter i met a woman in my ob's office who was holding a 2 week old i stated," after this one i'm all done" she laughed and said yeah i was too she had her tubes tied for 5 yrs and found out she was preg! <br>  <br>  anythings possible|`|mxWlNykzaa	i know people that this happened to them so ii dunno|`|nGwh7UCDaa	Of course it is possible, nothing is 100% effective against getting pregnant except for not having sex (and even Mary proved that wrong, haha. Sorry, not religious, just thought that was too funny to pass up). It is highy IMPROBABLE that this will happen, but not impossible. I've heard of women having babies after their tubes were tied, but you'll have to talk to your doctor about possible risks.

You could spend one whole day in pajama's and make breakfast finger foods, and rent some movies and keep the blinds closed, and have an all day movie fest.  You can go to the library, or to a bookstore and read for a couple of hours.  You could go to your local humane shelter and volunteer for a day, it may seem like work, but if y'all like animals, it will probably be fun.  You might could go see a play, or go to an independant theatre and see a movie there.  You could buy a fishing license and go fishing someplace.  You could go on a road trip, drive half a day and stop whenever you see something interesting, the other half, drive back, but on a different road.  You can go to a state park if you have one around.  Do you have any caverns around?  Go swimming if you have a pool around that you can use.  Some hotels will allow you to swim in theirs for a small fee.  You could go on a scavenger hunt.

KOYZfaDkaa	There is a possibility she could get pregnant. You never know for sure if precum is all clear of sperm for the record. Every woman doesn't ovulate on a timer either, she could be a few days ahead of that stuff you wrote. Every woman is different... great huh? Anyways, get her the "morning after pill" aka "Plan B" from a pharmacy. It is not an abortion pill, just a huge "overdoes" of birthcontrol. And use a condom, every SINGLE time. It won't feel so good if you end up a daddy before you're ready.|`|LO3BMobRaa	No protection can always result to this possibility especially with alcohol, it's just like ammonia and bleach.

Why take a chance and be paranoid.|`|Yk6cqJw1aa	There is a posibility that she IS pregnant! just have her do a pregnancy test two weeks from the day you had sex|`|ulhZpkvRaa	For starters, precum HAS sperm in it! And Im not sure why you mentioned urinating so many times but that doesn't affect how much sperm you will release, it has nothing to do with it. They come from seperate areas of the body, no connection. Sperm can live inside a woman for 5-7 days and it can sometimes take that long to reach the egg, so if she ovulates early then she can get pregnant. You can always get pregnant before ovulation and during ovulation. Basicly, yes she can get pregnant, it takes one little swimmer to get her pregnant and u could of released that little swimmer with your precum. Always wear a condom if you don't want a baby and trust me if you don't want a baby now don't be screwing around.|`|ydTgN4Ciaa	doubt it.

NXgSkmfeaa	O seu bebê já foi acustuma a dormir na sua presen?a,sobre a sua vigilancia.<br>  Ent?o vc deve coloca-lo no ber?o e ficar por perto até que ele durma e fique ali do lado dele pra que ele sinta que vc está ali velando pelo soninho dele<br>  Dai por diante ele sempre vai dormir sem vc precisar de estar do lado dele...<br>  Mesmo que ele chore,e fa?a pirra?a n?o tire de lá que por mais que seja doloroso ele ira acaba entendendo que o lugar dele é ali e que está seguro e vc sempre estará por perto...<br>  Espero que consiga pois pra  mim foi dificil de mais<br>  boa sorte|`|YECu7sWcaa	Tenho gemeos e um deles faz exatamente a mesma coisa q o seu bebe.....mais o meu dorme numa cadeirinha..<br>  <br>  Estou deixando ele durmir..e depois pego ele quando esiver no sono mais profundo e coloco no berco..se acordar vou la..ponho a chupeta..e a cobertinha, pois ele dorme abracado..dai ele dorme..acorda em 15 minutos..deixo chorar um pouquinho..depois pego..com isso ele foi acostumando e dorme mais la..vai pondo ele de vez enqudno no berco de manha pra acostumar , coloca aqueles brinquedinhos pra ele olhar sabe..aqueles q fica rodando..<br>  <br>  Aos poucos ele vai se acostumando...<br>  <br>  Boa sorte !!!!!|`|aqBpSyy2aa	coloque ele pra dormir no colo,depois vc coloca no ber?o e nina ele no ber?o,se ele acordar continue ninando,mas n?o coloque na cama pra ele ja ir sentindo q o lugarzinho dele é no ber?o,nada de cama,pois ele vai ficar acostumado até 1 ano  e é horrível isso,se ele acorda é porq realmente ele ja estar acostumado.|`|HHJR3gU9aa	Coloque-o no ber?o e fique ao lado dele até que adorme?a novamente.

Por exemplo, o Jap?o, para ser japonês, n?o interessa se vc nasceu naquele país, ou em aeronave ou navio japonês, o bebê terá a nacionalidade dos seus pais. No teu caso, se a aeronave fosse japonesa, a nacionalidade do bebê seria a  tua.

Mas se for realmente nescessario pro seu filho tomar suco nao coloque nada pois o a?uca pode estragar os futuros dentes e dar dor de barriga, o mel por sua vez so é liberado pra crian?as a partir de 1 ano pois em menores ele pode provocar "Botulismo". <br>  Va nesse site pois ele tem uma cartilha que se chama "10 Passos p/ uma alimenta??o saudavel"<br>  www.planalto.gov.br/Consea/static/docu... <br>  Espero ter ajudado|`|NXgSkmfeaa	N?ao..<br>  Pq cria?as com essa idade nem sentem muito o sabor das coisas<br>  além de as frutas já possuem o a?ucar natural delas e é bem mais suadaveis.<br>  Evite ter uma cria?as com problemas,ofere?a pra ela sempre o que for mais natural possivel.Mais se n?o tiver jeito tente ado?ar com rapadura ao invez de a?ucar faz menos mal aos bebês|`|aqBpSyy2aa	ja q ele tem 3 meses o certo é n?o da agua,suco nem nada... o leite materno tem todas as proteinas pra ele,o medico sempred iz isso...mas se vc quer da suco,o certo é n?o colocar a?ucar,se for de frutas,fa?a sem a?ucar,deixe apenas com odoce natural da fruta,cuidado pois a?ucar devi ser evitado na crian?a,principalmente ele sendo bebê.|`|HHJR3gU9aa	Eu nunca coloquei a?úcar nos sucos do meu filho.

556b0d919821bf9bcdfa818aa9e7debaaa	Tell them that you know but otherwise stay the hell out of their business.  It's up to them to decide when and who to tell not yours!|`|AA11280073	It is not your news to share. Stay out of it. |`|LY0zDqu9aa	stay out of it but be there if they need you|`|8nA9Ve8Maa	You should not go right on and tell your parents, what you should do is talk to your brother, tell him how you feel about it and maybe tell him that he should probably not keep this a secret and that HE should tell your parents. This way your parents will find out from him and your relationship with your brother and his girlfriend/wife will grow. Better he tell them now before other people start noticing and your parents find out from someone else.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Since they are married, there isn't anything your parents can do.  Unless they lied about their ages when getting married.<br>  <br>  Also, Think about the fact, that, your brother married her, instead of running out on her.|`|ukwEzumdaa	i think it would be funny to watch you tell them, but for your family's sake let your brother break the news|`|gLuDUbBlaa	dont be a little snitch. Let your brother tell them its his life.|`|yQRCBKXXaa	Stay out of it.  Your brother must be over 18 in order to get married without parental permission, so why interefere?  It is his life, and if your not supposed to even know, why get involved?  How do you know, anyways?  Something someone else "said"? and what truth is in it if it doesn't come from them anyways?  I would make sure you have your facts straight if your going to go and stick your nose in someone elses business, family or not.  |`|4c2NNnplaa	Its really up to you and what you think is best for your family. I personally would talk to my brother first and see what his reasons are for not telling them. He might have a very valid reason or might be preparing to tell them himself. <br>  <br>  In the end, you need to decide what is right for you and your family.|`|220b695ab00eca1c536e15d2f68abdd5aa	None of your business and getting yourself involved will only end up being bad news for you.  If you're dying to tell the secret, start with your brother.  Tell him that you know he's married & expecting and that if mom & dad ask you any questions, you are not prepared to lie for him.|`|oTjDBMtBaa	Play dumb! Act like you don't know anything! When the baby comes, your parents will turn to you and be like "I cant believe you knew about this and didnt say anything to us!" and your brother will be mad because he will think you told them early... Just play dumb.|`|x7JxiAouaa	i would stay out of it and just wait. you wouldnt want to ruin your relationship with your brother by them finding out your the one who told them.|`|AA11373993	No. I think the news should come from him. You should tell him that you know. Just not your parents.|`|vVO7Xlauaa	That should be his choice. |`|1cb9d97fc5fdf9070b04aad8d907f1fcaa	Tell your brother what you think you know and see what he says. Ask him if he is going to tell them...Good luck|`|5a1PpwrWaa	i honestly think you should stay out it. lets say you were in your brother case. you wouldn't want someone else to tell your parents thats there job. if they don't tell them sooner or later [which i hope they would because she pregnant] then you can step in and just say hey i know whats going on and suggest they tell.<br>  |`|mdVwsa0Baa	Tell it.  it will be a lot more damage if you wait.  Your parents will be angry with you if they find out you knew and didnt tell.  Bro and sis-law will be upset for a minute, depending on how your parents act.  If you can talk your folks into being very civil and mild (considering) the newyweds will be fine.  You foks need to have the joy of being a part of their grandchild's life...   Depending on how old he is, they may be more upset that he's married than they are about the baby.  It's not that bad.|`|A0tiM0HBaa	Stay out - it's not your place to tell your parents.<br>  <br>  If your brother wants to inform your mom and dad, that's his decision and his business.  Your becoming involved will only cause friction amongst your family - either between your parents and brother, you and your brother, or both.|`|ZMZNUcqJaa	Naaah, you should leave that up to your brother. he needs to tell them and he will when he's ready. you telling your parents would put you in a weird possition. |`|AA11695641	We already know. As your parents we wish you would have discussed it with us directly rather than us discovering it online on Yahoo answers. Sorry but we know your user id . We will discuss it in the morning. |`|OMpa2lDRaa	theyll find out sooner or later, dont tell them cause thats like snitching i guess..  let him do it on his own, not trying to be mean or anything :)|`|kQLQs2BVaa	Tell your parents, but ask them to leave you out of it.  That way you don't get in trouble with your brother. |`|CbeIwc3Raa	Stay out of it. It's none of your business, let your brother tell them when he feels the time is right.|`|Wcu6QZiKaa	Don't get involved. Say you didn't know ANYTHING or else your parents could scold you for not telling them sooner.|`|rbFh91Lwaa	YOU COULD TELL THEM THERE GOING TO FIND OUT ANYWAYS THEY ARE HAVING A BABY CANT HIDE A BABY DOOOOOO|`|XUfleLjMaa	It is definitely best just to stay out of it. He will tell them when he feels it is right.|`|gcxITuJvaa	let your brother tell them, when hes ready he will say something, he probably just needs time|`|XmG1CnAtaa	Stay out of it. |`|5hXH8s98aa	Nark that noob.  It will result in 100% lulz!|`|LDiMDOCvaa	let your brother tell them. that is up to him. they will find out soon enough :) |`|zKuoTu8Maa	he should tell them himself. they won't be able to hide it anymore in 4 months anyways.|`|1XhFeTM1aa	first i wood tell my bro that i know,<br>  then hell prolly say dont tell anyone<br>  so yea i wood not tell me parents<br>  |`|AA12260520	stay out...<br>  <br>  no offense...but its really not your business to tell them...<br>  <br>  wait it out...<br>  <br>  he will tell them when he is ready =]]|`|aWU6YCH3aa	well how old is your brother?

He is a very responsible and smart kid and knows when to leave a bad situation.  he graduated a year early and is at college right now and I know he will do what is best for him and the future!

Have a great time!|`|3Ze2m4qoaa	I am 15 and my parents would never let me go to a party! They would if I let them walk me to the door and let them come inside and meet who evers parents were there, then they would stay for a while untill they felt compfortable with leaving me there. They are freaks!!!|`|pzVRemDkaa	Yes, I would. I'd make sure I knew where, when and who they were with. They have to make their own mistakes and learn from them. As long as they are safe and I know where they are, there's no problem.|`|SBy4VFtEaa	I suppose so yes. Make sure you give them condoms though, if I know 15 year olds, sex is on their mind ALOT.|`|KHXH9qQWaa	yea, just make sure there is no alcohol at the party, and no smoking. And make sure it isn't a sex party.|`|AA10622097	It would depend on if I know the parents or not, if I know the kids who will be there, I don't just say yes or no, I need more facts.|`|hstwNjNaaa	Sure, as long as they told me where the party was I wouldn't have a problem with it.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	yea<br>  dont be one of those parents who makes your kid the only one not going<br>  <br>  my parents did the whole youre not old enough thing<br>  all (and i do mean all) of my friends where allowed out past 11 (not roaming the streets at a friends house) at 14 years old<br>  im 17 in a week and im still not. i have to be in the door before half 10 and have someone walk me home. my friends dont have a curfew anymore.<br>  my friends would always go to parties and go general get togethers that i wasnt alalowed to go to and it makes you feel so disconnected from them<br>  its put a big strain on my friendship with them becayse they allways talk about what they have done together and dont really include me <br>  because i was never around<br>  so dont make ur kid miserable<br>  it may jst seem like one party but it will add up and ruin there teen years|`|GAF8acNkaa	yes, find out where it is, who's going, and get phone numbers. Don't hound her, but call at the end of the night to remind her you will be picking her up from ____'s house at what time.

As long as it's properly supervised, I see no problem w/ it. And if the party is a girl's and it's a girl that's going, why can't they spend the night? Sleepovers are so much fun and it's all part of being a girl! |`|ByWRzuuraa	Obviously.<br>  They're FIFTEEN, Not 5 :)<br>  xx|`|0fs7uLdzaa	Yes as long as there was adult supervision and as far as "stay around" if you mean sleep over at a friends house again yes with the same provisions.|`|KUnDQfBGaa	She'll find a way to get there if she wants to go to the party bad enough, curfew or not!|`|XZla4anAaa	yup.<br>  <br>  as long as it is supervised, no drugs, and no drinking.<br>  <br>  totally fine.|`|9ZWcHnlJaa	sure, why not?<br>  im asuming shes been to parties before, so its not like a first time thing.<br>  and if she hasnt before..<br>  then holy sh*t dude.. overprotective much???|`|UZmtpKq4aa	yes|`|XtbjzpK7aa	yea nothing seems wrong. as long as they are not drinking
AA11061445	never ever abort a baby because of a man<br>  your baby is living inside you hun if your boyfriend does not want you to have the baby he is a waste of space,<br>  <br>  let him walk away but you will regret an abortion just because of a man|`|eUi7EFCdaa	Ultimately, its your decision. Nobody can make that decision for you. Does a person who threatens to walk away, a person that really loves you? If he loves you he will support you no matter what?<br>  <br>  Can you afford to look after a baby? <br>  <br>  Ultimately you need to decide which is more important the baby or whether your bf really loves you<br>  <br>  I hope everything turns out well<br>  <br>  |`|70Z4DJOcaa	dont allow him to alter you judgement on whether or not you'll keep this baby... it sounds like you want to keep the baby; then keep it. the baby is in YOUR body not his and he has to accept the responsibility since he was willing to have sex with you! |`|Py1oiwYQaa	You need to think seriously about being a single parent. You can go to court to get financial support from him, but you can't make him be a good dad, or even be a dad at all. If you want the baby, keep it, but realize that this is something you are very likely to be doing on your own. I'm sorry he's being such a jerk, but you can't really expect him to change - that will just be setting yourself up for more disappointed by him.<br>  |`|8P6MmLv0aa	Girl do what you feel like doing If you want to keep the baby then keep it, all I can say it that he can't love you that much if he wants you to get rid of it or threaten to dump you if you keep it even if he dose have other children  HE'S A PRICK.<br>  I would be over the moon if I had a girl friend who was pregnant.<br>  <br>  Congratulations girl and wish you all the best. <br>  |`|B5MDTdtPaa	what is a man by your side if he doesnt support you in what you want to do and doesnt care about yours and his child? im sorry but your old enough to know what to do, however hard it is...<br>  <br>  my friend was in your type of situation - she had abortion stuck with the man and it only ended it tears and major regret<br>  <br>  do what YOU want to do :) x|`|xxFwzfW4aa	dont be pushed into another abortion, u shouldnt have another, what if u cant have kids again because of it, he sounds very selfish, do u really ant to be with some1 like that??? you have one chance at this game and u need to decide if you want kids, hubby or no hubby...hope u get it sorted xx |`|TvtquDcKaa	This is a decision only you can make yourself, but hopefully the answers you receive here will help you through that. If your boyfriend is going to walk out on you when you are pregnant, then if you abort he will probably find another reason to walk out on you in the future. If you are happy with your pregnancy, have the baby. If you are unable to support the child or have misgivings about the pregnancy, consider adoption if you are able to emotionally handle giving up your child.|`|ux6j2OIeaa	I've been a single parent and i know that as long as you love your baby that's all that matters.  Its not easy, but you can do it.  I went from being married with one baby to being single with three babies as my ex-hus didn't want twins.  He even said we should have aborted them and tried again for just one baby so that we'd have two children only. 8years later and sometimes life has been hard but i wouldn't swap it, i love my kids.  |`|DQkoxa4Xaa	You really don't have a lot of options.<br>  you either keep the baby or you don't.<br>  If you keep the baby, he will probably walk.<br>  So your choice really is do you want to keep the baby or him???|`|fMEmQZOUaa	Too dam bad for him now isnt it!?!<br>  He should of thought of that before he shoved his **** in you without wrapping it.<br>  Don't be a murderer!<br>  Have the poor baby and give it up for adoption, a lot of women can't have babies..|`|8RKwP3gpaa	It's sad to hear that, but I seriously doubt that someone can look into their child's face and say that they don't love them. And if he does, that baby will have all the love it needs from you. Good luck!|`|cwVZ2DNFaa	i say its your body so its more your choice to have the baby. i say have it and maybe he'll come around.<br>  <br>  i hope everything goes well|`|2NxBl4t9aa	Unfortunately you may have just found out how much of a jerk he is! I say if you want the baby? Do what you want! Not tot mention I'm sure it was not easy for you doing an abortion before! After all the baby already has all the organs for life! He/she just needs time to grow! Don't let him bully you into an abortion! Also if he says he had no choice come back with , "Yes you did you could have rapped your package!" Now it your choice and he has no right to tell you he's not ready because he should have thought of that before the sex! This baby is a gift and you should keep it! It will be hard but I promise you every moment will make it well worth it! If he really leaves you for keeping the baby then you don't need him! I know because I have raised my first two children on my own for over 9 years! Heck if I could do it, you can do it! Just trust your heart and do what you feel is best! Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S. Besides you can take him to court for child support and there is no getting out of it for him! |`|fynzkVK4aa	I agree with other posters, don't let his attitude influence your decision, as you have been through an abortion before I am sure you know that it is a major decision, and you can't change your mind afterwards...if you are happy to have your baby, have your baby.  What he thinks I'm sorry but in my book that comes a very definite second to how you feel in this, after all if he chooses to he can walk away from this, but you don't have that luxury, one way or the other you have to deal with it.<br>  <br>  I have never heard anyone say they regretted NOT having an abortion, but I have heard a few say they wished they had ignored what other people said and kept their babies...whatever decision you make, make sure it is right for YOU and is what YOU want, regardless of what anyone else (me included lol) has to say about it.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of single parents out there if it should come to that, and plenty of happy well adjusted, successful adults who grew up in single parent families, so it can be done...if he chooses to walk thats his choice, but don't let him saying that push you into a decision that you may regret later on.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|ycdkngxlaa	He's just being mean, basically it's too bad, he helped you make that baby, so he has to help you take care of it once it's born.  <br>  <br>  You have already said you want to keep the baby, so go ahead, you don't need him. If he is saying he will leave you if you keep it, then i would just tell him to P*ss off basically and kick him out, if i were you he is selfish. There is lots of help out there for single mothers, and i'm sure you have family who will help too, good luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You never know though, you have a full nine months of pregnancy, he may just need time to adjust to having another baby. He may change his mind when the baby is born. <br>  <br>  OH YEAH, and one more thing, Congratulations!!!|`|N1vBy1kgaa	I'm not saying I will be able to answer this question as well as some because I can't say I have experienced what you are going through. But  I will give my opinion.<br>  <br>  The way I see it,  he is the one who got you pregnant and if now he is saying he doesn't want the baby, it's his own fault and he should have been more responsible. <br>  <br>  I think now that you have you baby you shouldn't abort it because of him. It's your body, babe and he is your boyfriend. If he loves you and cares for you that much he will do anything to make you happy. If you want the baby you have the baby. He will come to his senses eventually.|`|xTlfOPu5aa	you need to do what feels right to you. if having the baby is what you want, than definatley go ahead with this. he may just need a bit of time to get used to the idea? (how long ago did you tell him...)<br>  you never know how he will feel as he sees you grow with his child. i think you have already decided to have the baby, so once he knows that this is what you are doing he can start to get his head around it. hopefully he comes around but if he doesnt you have a beautiful baby from the relationship!! good luck hun :) x|`|G3pRM40raa	Yeh babe u need 2 decide if u wnat this baby or not!! & by the sounds of it u doo.. If my boyfriend did this ii would leave him & have my baby.. Have u got any kidz at the minute.. If not!! Have this 1 why not.. If u want this baby.. Thats all that matters.. & if he doesn't want it then tuff luck now.. Shudda used a condom or sumthing.. But if u decide u dont want this baby.. Then surley u can put him/her up 2 adoption.. & u kud make another person a very happy person!! Like some1 has sed.. Not many people can have babys..

All the best|`|Wns4hHqmaa	well then thats kind of rude considering that he helped you make,that innocent child dont abort just for his satisfaction do what you think is best and if that means being a single mum theres alot of help out there for you if you ever need it good luck with everything|`|qyjP5EBPaa	dear clara , i understand what  you will go through but i will still advise you to keep the  pregnancy. believe or not he will come back for the baby after delivery. it has  has happened to many people i know.|`|I8TD9wj3aa	He is an ASSHOLE!<br>  Kick him out, and have your baby!<br>  You are 30 years old, more than ready to have a baby, and having a moping, irresponsible daddy around will only complicate your life.<br>  Tell him he will have to accept, or LEAVE!|`|ByWRzuuraa	Keep the baby if you want it.<br>  He might change his mind after its born.<br>  Its probably alot for him to take in, Just give him time & if you want the baby and like u sed, ur happy , then have it, he cant stop you.<br>  Give it time :)<br>  Good luck xxxx|`|QM6wiVtVaa	You need to decide if YOU want the baby. Then go from there. If you want the child, then any man who claims to love you would support you and be there for you and his child.|`|U0yUgr24aa	Since when was emotional blackmail acceptable? What an absolute tw@t he is. Dump him.|`|GVcudkVoaa	You are a grown woman and you can make your own decisions. Keep the baby. :)|`|iR7n4AZYaa	Kick his a** to the curb! |`|LZ6ZsqM3aa	Well the decision is easy. You either keep your baby or not. <br>  Why would you want to be with someone who gives you a choice like that?<br>  <br>  My partner already had a 16 year old when I found out I was pregnant. He had previously said he did not want anymore children, but when I told him i was pregnant he went into denial at first. When I was 20 weeks and had found out I was having a girl then he came round. Our daughter is now 2 and a half an a right daddy's girl.<br>  <br>  If my partner had gave me the choice of having our child or losing him then I would have said goodbye right there and then.<br>  <br>  You could get rid of your baby but there s nothing to stop him walking away anyway. Tell him unless he wears a condom pregnancy is always possible.<br>  <br>  Do what is right for you and your baby and not what this bloke tells you to do. He may come round after the baby is born or he may not. But he will have to pay child maintenance. <br>  <br>  Oh and by the way he does not love you anyway if that is the choice he gives you|`|0H6sAPYFaa	This guy is a scum bag! You need to decide what YOU (not him) want to do. I have been here. I found myself preg at 18 and was forced into abortion by my then fiance and my family. I have regretted it ever since. I wanted that baby. I have now had 7 pregnancies and only have 2 children. All except that first pregnancy have been lost due to ectopic, 2 mc's and now a mmc. I am now 31.<br>  <br>  Having said that tho if I had the baby back then I would not have met my husband as the situation we met in would not have arose. I also would not live where I do now and so would not have met my current partner (hubby ran off with someone else 3 years ago - but I have 2 beautiful children).<br>  <br>  If you want this baby, you have it and sod him. You can get by alone. I was left with 2 yr old and 10mth old and survived. You can have a good life with a baby and you can meet other men who will love you and take on anothers child. I have even tho at the time I could not see a way foward, but you do get over that and can move on. If he doesn't want a child now he may never want another one. he has children, don't deny yourself this chance if it is what you really want.<br>  <br>  I will think of you<br>  x |`|5507858478baac68ed69511bef8b1860aa	him deciding he doesn't want the baby shouldn't stop him loving you! if he leaves you then he doesn't really love you does he.....<br>  <br>  its your decision, if you have the baby he will only make things worse for himself leaving you and the baby as he will want to have contact i assume when she/he comes, he just needs to accept its happening and hes going to be a dad again. if he is that apposed to it and does leave then you know he never really love you in the first place im afraid to say, either that or to arrogant to change his views. I hope he just needs time to come round.<br>  <br>  my boyfriends oldest brother who's in his 30`s have just found out there expecting, they never planed to have kids, kept saying oww in a few more years and then she has fallen pregnant, its taken them about a month to come to terms with the idea as it was such a shock to them both.<br>  <br>  fingers crossed he just needs some time, but dont have an abortion if your happy with having the baby!<br>  x

zHz6FTRNaa	It sounds a lot like a very similar thing happened to him. Probably when you guys were getting close and stuff, you both weren't really sure where you stood (correct me if I'm wrong). It sounds like as you fell for him, he fell for you. Perhaps he was startled by it, maybe he is afraid of getting hurt because he might think you don't return the same feelings. <br>  <br>  I think I have to stand with the sheep on this one and say talk to him, without a doubt. If he's staring at you when that guy has his arm around you, there is a very good chance he is feeling a touch envious. <br>  <br>  I think all he needs is a little prompting, start a conversation with him to get things flowing a little. Get it across to him that you really miss hanging out with him - the rest is up to you!<br>  <br>  Good luck : )|`|Kv8AGxHBaa	Trust me on this. You need to start the conversation with him. Im a guy, so I know it would be weird for him to come up to you after seeing that other guy hugging you.He probably thinks you don't like him by not talking to him. He probably likes you so go for it and just talk to him.|`|H5r8zBBMaa	why dont you send him a message on myspace..maybe from there youll start talking again ask him how you been and things like that..juss tell him stright up you miss him...maybe he stares at you cause he wishes he could be in that guys place maybe he misses you to..|`|qL3iB0J4aa	Well for starters, tell him you miss talking to him.|`|xst7KYQ3aa	Well love, I'm not one of the sheep, and i am not a baaaa'd influence, but this one, this boy is sending up red danger flares all over the place.  My gut feelings are the relationship between you and the one you want just went south, and the original guy is pproving it to himself in a very bizarre manner of setting you up to prove himself right.  Much as a cutie he looks, I think his guitar is sour tuneed.  Hate to say it, but this time..walk off..from both. I dont do stanlking setting-up<br>  <br>  |`|szVvf7Nkaa	Why is he staring at me? <br>  There could be many reasons why he’s staring at you. But you have to ask him.  Tell him that you noticed that he’s staring and ask him if there is anything wrong. Or if there is something he would like to tell you. You said you used to talk a lot so you shouldn’t be afraid to talk to him.<br>  <br>  Is there anything I can do to make him fall for me?<br>  No dear, there is nothing that you can do for him to fall in love with you.  The heart has a mind of it’s own. It cannot be forced to love someone.<br>  <br>  How can I talk to him without seeming too desperate, like without letting him know that I miss talking to him . . .  a lot? <br>  Ask him how he’s doing. And be honest with him. Tell him that you really miss talking to you. Maybe he misses you too and that is why he’s staring at you all the time. Don’t let your silence keep you from finding out if you can get back what you lost with this guy. Good luck.

Either a Medela or Ameda.  I have an Ameda because the Medelas are super expensive but in the end they really are worth it.  They are just made better and have a better "suck."

It is so worth it!!|`|veC6wUy9aa	I had a cheaper one, and ended up having to buy a Medela Pump in Style, and absolutely loved it.

They're pretty good names, but I'm not sure about the last one. You have to say those names like a hundred times if that's what you're going to name your kids or something.

qfKctLGGaa	I can't tell if your british or American by the question over driving, if your American (apologies if your not) The british are not allowed to learn to drive until they are 17, but back to your question.  Personally I would allow her to go with a bit of advice about excess drinking and boys who take advantage of girls who are drunk (your her sister so she shouldn't see it as an interfering overprotective mum routine) If she has a phone tell her she must ring you at a pre arranged time (set the alarm on her mobile!) to let you know shes ok and take the home number for her friends house incase when she rings you she sounds like something is wrong or she sounds extremely drunk.<br>  At the end of the day shes 16 and just like any other mum (biological or not) you have to trust you've done a good job raising her and let her taste some freedom.  If shes a sensible girl she should be fine and will be happy with the rules of not to much alcohol, ring me at such a such time, have a good time.  If shes a very immature girl who has a tantrum everytime she hears no and comes home drunk from school then say no, not on your life! |`|BkdZq0QPaa	you should let her go and have her freedom or she'll just end up resenting you for it<br>  make sure your boundaries are clear though, no drinkin sex smokin etc... and threaten to take away another priviledge (like another party or summat) if anything does happen or she gets into trouble<br>  but shes 16 so shes most likely to drink, perhaps tell her she can have a bit but not to get drunk, depends on how strict you are with her<br>  plus your husband will be in, so will her friends parents who shouldnt let anything out of hand<br>  ask for her friends house number or to keep her mobile on so you can  check up one or 2 times|`|1Jv7aUKhaa	hi :)<br>  i think mayb yu shud let her go. just make sure she has a phone with her at all times and make sure your husband gives her a ring here and there. if she cant drive thats a good thing right? make sure you give her a time to be home. im sure she would apriciate it if you gave her the trust to go and hopefully she will respect that and stick to your rules for that night. if she disobeys you know wer u stand next time something comes up like this. <br>  hope it all works out<br>  xxx|`|ByWRzuuraa	Shes 16, Not 6, Let her go :)<br>  x|`|GOwtkwkdaa	I dunno what do you think?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081023213743AAHIFtb">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|De6zfa3Laa	I'm 20 and I have custody of my 13 year old brother. I find situations like this pretty hard bc it wasn't that long ago when I was this age going to these places. If there is alcohol there and everyone there is drinking then it will be harder for her to say no. When I was that age I knew that if my mom was picking me up I couldn't drink because she would know. But if I could get a friends parent to take me home it would be easier to sneak into my room. If you trust that she won't drink then let her go. If you don't trust her and still let her go make it harder for her to get away with it if she were to drink. Call and check on her, have your husband pick her up ETC. |`|duECVxVraa	let her go but talk to her about drinking to much.How it can make you do things you will regret later!! Tell her how you felt and did when you where 16.Ask her friends parents to keep an eye on the drinking|`|AA12033653	It is a matter of trust.  Do you trust your sister not to drink, or if she does do you trust that she will not drive and she will call your husband for a safe ride.  <br>  <br>  My question would be why are these parents of the friend allowing there to be a lot of alcohol at a teen party??  Are these parents going to be responsible to make sure that any of the 16 year olds that drink don't drive? Are they going to take responsibility if any of the 16 year olds drink too much and end up in the hospital with alchohol poising?  <br>  <br>  Talk to the friends parents before hand and get a better sense of what kind supervision they are going to provide on party night to the 16 year olds.  You say that the parents will be "in" but will they be close by if things at the party get out of control.  <br>  <br>  Both of my younger brothers went to these types of parties, one ended up being chased by cops then ending up in the hospital with alcohol poisining.  The other brother, when my parents went to pick him up he was so trashed and no one would tell them that he had been drinking, they called the ambulance and rushed him to the hospital for fear that something was severly wrong, turned out he too had alcohol poising.  At both of these parties the parents were "in".  In another part of the house not paying any attention to what was going on in the next room.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck

jtvFoIfhaa	its diffrent for everyone, some wemon get it right away and some it takes a year or so. i would also maby talk to your doc if it does not start in a few months, that way you can let them know and they will proubley not do much just yet but this way you may feel better and if you would like it to start agen then they could proubly help you with that. sometimes getting on the pill helps to start your period and then after a few months you can stop that and your period will still come, the pill just jumpstarts it for you|`|AA11947878	mine took a year to come back, and that was after intervention from my dr.|`|ZwOXaHWPaa	When I was on it, I bled off and on, more on than off,  for almost two months, then nothing at all for almost 5 years.  Then I went off, and it took several months before i started again.  Unfortunately, when I started trying to concieve, it took nearly another 5 years before we got lucky.  I can't prove it had anything to do with the shot, but I did end up gaining like 65 lbs. while on the shot.  you should talk to your doc.|`|5U5kfDNuaa	I never bled when I was on the shot, maybe 3-4 months after it expired i started to have my period again.

owo1K8TNaa	it might sound strange but kids can tell a lot more than you and perhaps they see something in the house that is scaring them. what i would do is get some icecream sit in the back yard on a rug and start talking to them. ask them questions my son is 3 and he was scared of a toy in his room it was effecting him so much that he wasnt getting him enough sleep. also assure your kids that u will always have them and protect them. sometimes in this life we get so busy we forget to reassure our kids and they need it so desperately coz they feel alone.<br>  <br>  hope this helps even a little good luck :)|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Moving can be pretty unsettling for young children. But luckily they are also easily swayed and won over! Take them into town and let them pick out some things to go in their new bedrooms. Let them "help" decorate and choose where things should go.

It may give you some insight.  Can you think of anything else that has changed drastically other than the new home? Are you perhaps acting differently in any way? Try to make the house fun and do activities that you did in your old house to bring back some familiarity for your children. Moving is stressful for everyone no matter what age they are.

I am also 17 years old and I have 2 sons ages 2 on Nov. 7th and 3 on Jan. 2nd and i got pregnant whenever I was 13 and had him whenever I was 14 and pregnant again whenever i was 14 and had him whenever I was 15 and honestly they have changed me so much they are MY life I dont know what I would do wiothout them I begged my mom to let me get an abortion and she wouldnt let me and honestly I thank God everyday that she didnt... My opinion I would never evr let my daughter get and abortion sooo yea do what you want but I think that you could do it....... GOOD LUCK :)<br>  |`|iVQuOVHKaa	i had an abortion at 14 and have regretted it everyday since (4yrs)<br>  one piece of advice i was given and never listened to was:<br>  if youre not 100% about it dont do it!<br>  you have a long time to make ur mind up dont rush it but u sound like ur in a financially stable position for a child <br>  its your choice and your body choose whats best by you <br>  but tbf you should have used more protection and if youre not prepared to make the choices and deal with the consequences then you shouldnt be having sex (as good as it is) <br>  hope you make the right choice xx<br>  |`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	I'm not in that situation, but I think you both need to sit and talk it over before making any decision. I do understand not wanting to have split custody, etc. But this is a child. I believe in pro-choice, but I couldn't have an abortion. It's just the way I am.<br>  <br>  If you can't make up your mind, why not talk it over with your mom? (If you're close)<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  I hope this works out for you|`|eBKJRmEgaa	It's your decision, not anyone else's. Do what you think is best for you.|`|xpUyH0psaa	i think you should really talk to your boyfriend. if you don't want the child, but he does, maybe you can have the child then give the child up to him. if not then, maybe you two should look into adoption. though in the end, if you really think these solutions can't help you, then you might want to think about abortion. abortion should be the last resource. do what you think will be best.|`|ZEO7RhGzaa	If you want an abortion, then get one.  But from then on you need to be careful.<br>  <br>  If you don't think you're in a stable relationship, why are you having sex with him?|`|pAW2c7c9aa	Do what you feel is best for you and your relationship.|`|0M45cne5aa	No, don't get an abortion. You shouldn't of had sex with the kid if you thought you were going to split up and if you didn't know you could potentially become pregnant. You're 17 years old, almost an adult, you need to take consequences for your actions, seriously. I got pregnant when i was 14 years old, a lot younger than you. You don't think i didn't have all those thoughts running through my head also!? But never was i so bad of a person to resort to abortion as my birth control. I had the baby, and now 2 years later i'm doing fine, and i have a beautiful 2 year old daughter and one on the way (8 weeks preg.). I'm still with the father and i am very very happy. I know you're scared, but trust me just take a second to step back and think with your boyfriend (what everyone else thinks put aside), and make a solid/bold plan together for your new lives. Don't think about what if.. that's no way to live your life. What if you decided to get an abortion, but you ended up getting a good job that next week and you ended up marrying this kid?! I didn't have a job when i got pregnant, but in a week i found one, because i pushed myself and i became VERY responsible in what i had to do. Good luck...

FHT6wsUpaa	Is he shrieking in pain? If not, he's probably just discovered his volume control, and the best thing to do in that situation is to ignore him. Once he realizes he doesn't attract an audience, he'll move onto other things.<br>  <br>  That said, my daughter cut her first two teeth at 9-1/2 months and had several (unexplained, at the time - until we discovered the teeth) episodes of frantic screaming/crying as if she were in pain. The only thing I could really do was comfort her...and treat her symptoms accordingly once I realized she was cutting two teeth at once. Try a cold wet wash cloth - if he bites and chews on it, he probably is teething.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ccad1af60fac9baa5be1c4b6e35f105baa	Sounds like he may be teething or may have a cold.  Have you taken his temperature?  Try some baby orajel and see if that helps.  At that age, crying and/or screaming is the only way he knows how to let you know something's wrong.  Chances are something is making him uncomfortable.|`|piPK22hdaa	If he's not crying he could be doing the same my lil one is...experimenting with her voice.  I can't believe she doesn't get hoarse or headachey herself!  It is just a phase and once they learn other noises or skills, he will forget about shrieking at least for a while.|`|sa1JGWSkaa	Talk to him when he shrieks.  Calmly engage him.  Look directly at him.  Maybe he's trying to get your attention, but doesn't know how to communicate.

It relates to either yourself or a friend of yours.<br>  <br>  but let's say you wake up one morning and your husband is a completely different person.<br>  * it happens to many of us<br>  <br>  he beats you up, beats up your kids. ok, maybe that's extreme. <br>  * If that’s the case, you MUST leave him for the sake of your kids – but ‘legally’.  There are shelters for this (they have an abundance of resources) and there’s a procedure … and most importantly, there’s support!<br>  <br>  maybe he just yells profanities at you and your kids and throws and breaks stuff.<br>  * Unacceptable!  This is domestic violence and NOT the environment kids deserve to grow up.<br>  <br>  you love him too much so you don't call the police. <br>  * Admit yourself into a co-dependency program, because is clearly a case of co-dependency.<br>  <br>  you just want to keep yourself and your kids away from him while he cools down and possibly revert to his usual self. <br>  * If he’s really like that, he has a serious personality disorder (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality...</a> <br>  <br>  how would you do it?<br>  * The legal way = shelter, police, court hearing, get custody, set up (supervised?) visitation, etc.<br>  <br>  i'm thinking dead of the night. i'll drug him so he doesn't wake up as i ready the kids, pack stuff, <br>  * Do you really want to have your children visiting you in jail?!?<br>  <br>  and even blowdry my hair if the drug's good. lol!<br>  * If you take drugs, maybe it’s you the kids need to be taken away from <br>  <br>  then me and my kids can stay in a swanky hotel using his credit card. haha!<br>  * which he would cancel immediately as soon as he sees the first charge on his account – and then you’re on the street<br>  <br>  As I was writing the answers, your question and situation is really disturbing.  I hope whoever is in this situation seeks out help.  Also know that unless there is proof that the father abuses the children, he has equal right to them, meaning 50/50 share … provided he wants that.  Should he be abusive, the burden of proof is on you and you ‘have to’ start filing police reports … no matter how much you ‘love’ him.<br>  <br>  We as parents/moms have to protect our children and provide as emotionally and physically save environment as we possibly can.  Whoever is in this situation - whether it’s you or your friend - you MUST seek help … for your children’s sake!<br>  <br>  If I can be of further assistance, let me know.<br>  <br>  ***********************************<br>  <br>  I'm very glad to hear that it's not you who's in that situation.  Unfortunately, your made up situation applies to too many women out there.<br>  <br>  Therefore, for those … once more … leave, but don’t abduct the child (of course, don’t leave the child behind either).  I know of too many cases where the mother ran away without a court order and lost custody.  You think it’s bad now; try imagine possibly never seeing your child again or only being granted supervised visitations.<br>  <br>  For those who are in a situation like this … be smart, explore your options and think this thing through before you act.|`|yZDyUfSNaa	In my experience, yes, this may be a made up question but far too many women and children find themselves in this sad and scary situation, and it probably hits way to close to home for a lot of women here. <br>  <br>  As for us...we ranged from 2 to 10 in age...and we left in broad daylight. My father was one of those that hit and kicked and screamed and threw things etc. When my mom decided enough was enough, she contacted a lawyer and the police, secretly. The day of "the leave," we pretended to be cleaning out the attic and dragged garbage bags of junk to the car to bring to the dump. In reality, it was our clothes and personal belongings and we walked every single item past my father who was sitting on the couch the whole time. We left for the "garbage dump," my grandparents house, and a sheriff arrived to serve my dad with divorce papers and a restraining order. <br>  <br>  In the end, everything turned out well for us, my dad cleaned up his act and we even have relationships with him these days, but far too many of these stories end in tragedy. I truly hope you, or someone you know isn't in this situation. If you are, there really is help out there.|`|j2mRop0laa	Gawd.. some people. I just don't know how they live in society like everyone else when they can't even be lighthearted on YA for 10 minutes. All that seriousness is a total downer.<br>  <br>  Anywayyyy......I like the drugging thing. Maybe slip a sleeping pill in his beer and wait till he passes out. Make sure you chain his arm to the bed post, just in case he wakes up. Grab all credit cards, laptops, photo albums, clothing, box up the toys you can fit in the car, get anything else worth money and hit the road. I would take all the money out of the banks in cash (some place local) then ditch town and pay for everything in cash so it couldn't be traced. :)|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	I would suggest that they post on the "Wish Upon A Hero" website. There are people there who work for domestic abuse shelters who have helped numerous people to safety.|`|OxFV92hJaa	Hmmm. Strange but interesting question. <br>  <br>  I say the same as I do to any fast needed permanent escape.<br>  <br>  New names, new I'D's, cash out/sell off anything and everything, and go to a country that has no U.S. sanction laws. <br>  <br>  Simple as that. <br>  <br>  Just be sure you know the language, and have enough $ to survive lol.....hypothetically.|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	Okay, I know this a hypothetical question, but if he ever hits me, I will not deny calling the police. I would call the police and have him jailed. I would then seek an immediate restraining order against him to keep him away from me and the kids. I would not leave, he would not be allowed to come home and if he comes near the home I will call the police again. Also, those saying you would face kidnapping charges or you would lose custody, they are wrong. In a violent situation, you were doing the best by your family for leaving if the above is not possible. <br>  <br>  Anyway in the situation described above, without calling the police, I would have to let him leave the house to go out with friends or something. I would have to plan ahead, slowly packing things weeks ahead of time. If it has become really violent, i would not even pack. Whenever the first chance came up, i would leave with just whats on my back to a hidden woman's shelter. If it is just throwing things and cussing, I would just leave in the middle of the day or kick him out. If he became violent, I would call the police. But if I could not call them, I would leave when he is gone at a friends house. I could not bring myself to drug someone like that. But there is no way I would go back to a violent man, even if it happens once.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	That... that's just horrible to think about, but a valid question.<br>  <br>  Were I ever in a situation that I needed to escape (be it from my husband or all of us from something else) and have a safe place to go, I'd ring a friend in Scottsdale or Santa Fe (we live in WA - I'd prefer to stay somewhere far enough away that an aggressor wouldn't make the connection or know who I'd go to) and stay there until I figured out what to do for the long term. Probably stay in a hotel once I got to the new town.<br>  I've retained my bank account and finances separate from my husband, so money wouldn't be an issue.<br>  <br>  This actually came up not terribly long ago, so the idea of having to leave is still fresh in my mind. When I was pregnant with my daughter (now 5 months), a former employee got really aggressive toward myself and my business partner and started with a lot of stalking behavior. It's pretty scary. He would show up at the lobby of my condo and harass me, make insane phone calls to my husband at his office, even called/showed up at my parents house.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	not funny, sorry, hits too close to home. How many nights did my mom ask me if I wanted to move to Norway, when I was pissed at my dad??? Too many.... I think drugging a person may perhaps be illegal.... Just thinking..... Also, I'm sure your kids don't care about a hotel, they care about mommy and daddy not leaving eachother
DPegPYRPaa	I guess it all depends. My niece was 12 when she started babysitting and she had basically helped raise her 3 year old cousin. She had tons of experience with other small children so we gave her a chance. She did great. I would also suggest the CPR and first aid certification and talk to people local to you. Good luck!|`|27aea472b3667b064c6f98d70ac05c5caa	That's a little too young for me. I just let a babysitter watch my children last weekend for the first time and I was a nervous wreck because I thought she was too young (16). I think anything under 13-14 would be unacceptable.|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	to young but try first around your naiver hood that's ware everyone noes her so they might give her a chance.|`|8DhRxcF7aa	i think she is a little bit too young, maybe she should wait until shes 13, or maybe she should find someone a little bit older to go with her, and help her at first|`|B4Cz1vUEaa	It would be good for her to start out babysitting in a situation where the parent is close by.  When I started babysitting, I would watching the kids while the parents were working out in the fields (there were farmers) or doing yard work.  That way I could prove myself and once they trusted me, they would then started leaving him during the day when they wanted to shop or run errands or go out for dinner for a short time and then expanded to evening out.    Putting up fliers is a little uncontrolled.  I would encourage you to talk to people you know at work or at church so she can start out babysitting for families you know and trust.  And then she can get recommended to other families from those families.  If she is mature and does a good job, it won't take long for her to establish a good reputation.    Other idea is to see if they would bring the children to your house under your supervision or maybe you could be available by telephone in case she had questions or needed help.    Good babysitters are hard to come by.  Good luck to her.|`|AA12344593	Some children are indeed very mature but I wouldn't put her under unneccesary pressure at this age. I was very mature and I started taking care of my sister when I was eight but I don't think in reality someone would understand unless it was a close family friend how mature she is. It's hard enough to leave your children with anyone much less a child herself. I understand the whole maturity thing but I would keep her close to home for a while until she gets a little bit older or if she looks older... I would get her to babysit a couple times a month for close friends for short hours.  Remember, although she's mentally mature for her age, she is a child. And make sure she is getting paid correctly. This can be great for children to learn and I think it keep teen pregnancy rates low too because reality is right there. I know that raising my sister kept me from getting pregnant at a young age. Oh my gosh! It was soooo stressful. But good luck on whatever you decide.|`|Z2mBDLuGaa	Hi    I would check your state laws to see what age it is legal for a child to stay home alone. Also she may want to take a first aid & cpr class.  Hope this helps!
cHEGf8Hcaa	Yes, I've noticed. There seem to be more twins than single births, especially. I doubt the sincerity of most them, but I like to answer anyway, just in case it is genuine.|`|oOcyljKWaa	a lot of people on here are just bored teenagers people who have names like Mrs Jonas I love Edward and so on and so forth|`|nOzQUsToaa	You know, sometimes they create a baby name game, which I love very much (I'm encouraging ;), or just asking for our favorite baby names, our opinions about their chosen names. But you're absolutely right, there are some who like to make up things. When I was younger I did it for a few times, creating families for my own enjoyment. But who didn't? =)|`|zbjaBgyEaa	I remember seeing in a Canadian Living magazine an article with a family whose three triplet sons were born with cleft-tongues.  It shows their medical progress and such - very cute story.    In the side bar it said how the chances of having triplets was 1 in 500,000.    So I agree it's wierd to see several questions every hour about triplets.    Twins are a much better likeliness (I know several sets of twins - at least three or four), but even so, the number of questions is a little ridiculous.    I think some of the questions are baby-crazed pre teens who think that more babies = more fun.  Or something like that.  Some of it has to be trolling.|`|i2RSpZ6caa	I've thought the same thing, especially when the questions are about sextuplets (6). I always think to myself, "Well, if these sextuplets are really going to be born, there is no way the media won't get wind of it and we'll hear about it." And sure enough, we never heard about it.|`|A7Aa4ycPaa	I'd be willing to bet that about 90% of the people who claim to be having multiples are fake. Twins I might believe (if it's not not "we're having twins for the third time!), but if it's higher order multiples, I just don't buy it. Especially when it's "all girls", as so many seem to claim.     On pretty much every baby-names forum I've seen, it's a problem to some degree. I think some people just don't realize that it's okay to like names if you're not expecting a baby. So many of these people are really just teens making up as many babies to name and get attention for as possible and I have to wonder how many are just embarrassed to be talking about something seen mainly as a 'parent thing' in society.  I'm 17, and I always feel a bit weird writing out a top 10 or 20 of my favorite name combos - mainly because I wonder what others would think if they didn't know it was 'just for fun'.    I imagine it would be sort of like playing the Sims though - create a person, name it, and pretend to live their life without any consequences! Sounds fun until you get a bunch of annoyed people calling you out! The media makes it seem like higher-order multiples are much more common than they really are [darn you, TLC!], and a lot of fakers don't seem to realize that if they were /really/ having sextuplets the media would be all over them, and what Yahoo Answers thinks of their name choices would really be the least of their worries, with all of the medical risks!|`|qXq0nmBzaa	The last time I asked this same question, many of the respondents said they just liked sampling names and thought people would be more responsive if they told a compelling story.    Makes sense to me even tho I find it incredibly annoying. I'll often skip those questions along with the ones that ask us to choose the best name and there's over 50 names on the list. Why bother?|`|XzV4bUeFaa	there are always some people who will do yahoo ask just for the purpose of asking.  I believe that those who are saying they are having twins are probably mostly believable.  Some may have had fertility treatments also, and that is why there are multiples.|`|fZGcufB7aa	Yes. I have noticed that there are way too many questions regarding twins. I see like 7 of them on here in one day. I don't get it, and most of the time they are a boy and a girl.    The only thing is my sister is having triplets! I'm so excited to be an aunt. She is 19 and 5 months pregnant. I have asked 2 questions regarding her triplets names. Her top 10 favorites right now are:  Anna Caroline  Taylor Grace  Emilia Brielle  Emily Brielle  Elodie Piper  Eden Charlotte  Zoey Lynn  Catherine Hope  Arabella Joy  Sophia Rose    If I do get best answer then please tell me which names that you like for her triplet girls.|`|xLabGD6Maa	I suspect most of these pregnancies are in-vitro.  Unless multiples happen naturally, I tend to discount the uniqueness of a multiple birth.|`|ppE0GtkIaa	I have notice that alot. There is one lady who is not pregnant and told the room she cant have babies but she is always saying she is pregnant with quad or quints. She was on the baby name today too. Then there are women on here who are honest but people give them a hard time and give them weird pathetic names. Quads, Quints or more babies are rare. The lady who had the 8 babies are the only 2nd set in USA but people say they are caring all these babies when its not true.  I think they are just looking for attention and something to ready when they wake up in the morning, who knows...lol|`|5mSyCud8aa	well twins are not as rare as they used to be they are actually becoming quite common and triplets are not nearly as common but every 1 in 50 births are now triplets as for the twins every 2 in 25 births are twins i have not heard of more than this really on here that i actually believed so yea and a lot of people who are asking for like quads or sextuplets or more are making a game out of it and they are not being serious!!|`|bT4npA7Jaa	Yes, I agree, but you must also realize that these are people from around the world, not just the United States.
PPqQ7yuDaa	First you need to talk to someone you trust like an aunt or counselor. Have them advised on all your options.  Then have them help you talk to your parents. Go to your parents with some kind of plan.  But still let them know that you made a poor descion and you can't change it but you would like their help with guiding you to make the right decision about the situation at hand.  They will be mad at first. but they still love you.  So it will pass.  Whatever you decide do remember God would never give you anything you can't bear.  So this may be a hard time in your life but just keep praying and it will get better.  And you will be a stronger and more mature person about it.  Good luck|`|kT7GVOosaa	tell him that making you choose is not an option. it is both your guys' baby so it is both your decision. go over pros and cons of both keeping it and putting it up for adoption.    thank god you didn't get an abortion!!!! Thank you!|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	First, you need to sit down with your parents and his parents and talk about this.  Honestly, adoption seems like your best choice.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	I know it's scary... but telling your parents will help! It will get some weight off your shoulders, and they will help you. If you need to talk to anyone, you can email me. Just be brave, and I'm so proud of you for taking responsibility. The next step, telling mom and dad.|`|pkdDEJd4aa	If you are 14, I'd say own up to what happened (if you are mature enough to have sex, then you are mature enough to face  your parents and friends and boyfriend and tell them you're pregnant), have the baby, and think about adoption. You are still so young, you'll want to give the baby a chance at life, but you also want the baby to have parents who are very ready to raise a child. You'll find that it will be so rewarding, giving a son/daughter to a couple who can't conceive on their own.   As for getting kicked out of school, take the consequences that come with this. It'll be alright. Maybe try homeschooling. Oh, and when this is all over, please stop having sex!|`|LWwGW48Daa	Good luck sweetie! Talk to your parents or go seek advice at a local clinic. They can guide you through your options!|`|mITagmdHaa	WOW, 14, CATHOLIC, and PREGNANT.  Let me guess that you're probably of Latino decent as well?  Why does this not surprise me.  Here is an idea, STOP LETTING RELIGION RUN YOUR LIFE!  Do you want the baby or not?  If you do, keep it, if not, then time for the alternative.  This is the reason there are so many teenage pregnancies.  Because parents won't take the real responsibility, they just hide behind the religion and tell you don't do this because god will hate you.  Get a clue.|`|8jsoK3zdaa	age have very little to do with it. if you can do it, do it. it well be hard but it well only make you stronger.  no one will hate you or think bad about you for keeping a baby and doing whats right. if you do think of adoption, dont make it a for sure. i cant tell you what to do but i can honestly tell you what ever your feeling now well change. when you first feel the baby kick, see him or her on an ultrasound, feel him get the hiccups. theres tons of great things you experience while being pregnant. dont get me wrong either, being pregnant sucks once you get to the 3rd trimester. you cant do anything right. its still great though. imagine going through 9 and a half months of caring for and carrying YOUR BABY, then going into labour and dealing with all that only to have then take him or her the minute he pops out and walking out of the room and then your in recovery for the next 24 hours only to go home with nothing. you WELL regret it. your parents obviously love you and are obviously going to think your too young. but whatever decision you make they well be there and support you and help out. and they WELL be happy grandparents. do what YOU want! DONT listen to anyone else.  GOOD LUCK!! please really think over any decision your thinking of before you make it. im due in 5 days and yeah its going to hurt like a BIG *****. but its going to be totally worth it in the end. and i just turned 19. yeah im older than you, but still pretty young. CONGRATS.|`|ON84EQaBaa	I so sorry for you, you are only 14 and are faced with a major problem. We sometimes think our parents are the worst people in the world to try and talk to. Sure you guys made a big mistake, but its done. We as parents have also made mistakes, you need to sit them down & talk to them, sometimes it easier to talk to the one you're closest to, its gonna hurt them but they got to know you're only 14 and that's a lot for you to deal with. Maybe they will adopt or raise the baby until you're out of school and able to accept your responsibilty. As far as getting kicked out of your school remember thats not the only school.  Plese don't let this happen to you again, at 14 having sex is a no no , if you're that hot use some type of birth control, and make sure you mate use a condom or two! I pray that everything go well for you & your family.|`|3GMoYy0paa	Talk to your parents about it first before you make a decision|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	1- go to the dr and make sure you are pregnant  2- tell the father, discuss what you want to do  3- tell your parents|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	omg ur in trouble  tell ur parents|`|dxTwHB1yaa	We've sure got a fair share of pregnant 14 year olds here, haven't we?|`|t2XOjDy4aa	I would talk to your parents, and the father of the baby. Discuss options. I would really consider adoption, because you are only 14. No where near ready to be a mommy. Also, if you do have the child, your parents will be the one it effects. Not to mention you. At least this way, you can give someone the chance to have a baby that couldn't....and you can go on with your life.|`|9CkHsLl2aa	**** 2 weeks after i found out i was prego  i didnt get to tell my parents...they asked if i was on my period cause me and my mom have the same cycle time and i said yes and they said prove it and i couldnt then it all went shitty from there now im 32 weeks livin with my boy freind since 26 weeks...my parents were working me to hard and i was raising all their kids and they were stressing me to hard thats also what caused me to go into preterm labor....but im keeping my baby and im almost 16|`|8mchLCQhaa	You spread your legs now be a big girl like you thought you were and tell your parents!|`|wxBFZ41Taa	You need to talk to your parents first. The love you, and this is their grandchild.     Part of being grown up is dealing with situations like this like an adult. Realize that you and your boyfriend decided to have sex, knowing full well that sex, by design, creates babies. Remember that the person you carry, is a human being and individual. He or she had no say in being created, it was purely the decision of you and your boyfriend.     Stand up and realize that you and your boyfriend will be parents. Decide what is best for the baby. Adoption may be your best bet. Everyone wins..the baby gets to live, you get to go on with your schooling and life, and a childless couple get the baby they've always wanted.     But your parents may decide to help you...and that can change things. Be strong.|`|m1oaS5Xpaa	sounds like you're screwed to me!|`|NWv9hOFYaa	What the heck! Didn't you know you are too young to have sex. What's up with people being saying they are catholic, but do everything against catholism!  Gosh! I am sooo pissed!|`|em8A42Bqaa	What can we tell you?  You didnt listen to your parents, why would you listen to a bunch of strangers??|`|bmoCpcdraa	you can die having a child you are to young check with doctor must tell parents you need medical help|`|zSABr7praa	Tell him face to face, and then tell your parents-face to face.  You need to show your parents right now, more than ever, that you can be responsible and own up to your actions.  Writing a letter or telling them on the phone is the "easy" way out, they will respect your courage if you come out and tell them face to face.  Maybe tell your mother first so she can help you tell your father.  They will help you and your boyfriend make the best decision.  I'm glad you are considering adoption over abortion, good for you.  Best of luck!

I have heard many varying stats on this but i have heard they could live up to 5 days inside a woman.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	Male sperm tend to die off sooner (within 72 hours), but female sperm can live for up to 5 days.

Also, when my boyfriend was a young kid he got in to a box of fruit by the foot while his mom was not looking and then his poop was blue lol. His mom was freaked out and then figured out it was the fruit by the foot.|`|XOtHsTo0aa	Well, just the other day my mother in law was keeping her and could not find her pacifier.

FUNNY POOP FACT!! kids have a hard time digesting one of the red dyes found in food... when i was lil it used in the cereal KABOOM My parents rushed me to the ER because they thought I just pooped blood.. turned out many parents had to rush their kids to the ER for the same thing all resulting from the cereal...|`|lYsrCTCwaa	When my son was a toddler he chewed on everything!!

I swear to God, both Saturday & Sunday morning when I changed his diaper it looked pure coffee grounds mixed with poop! A couple of weeks ago he stayed with my mom & she said when she got him up & changed him it looked like he had pooped sand! She called wanting to know what the heck I had fed him the night before! It's crazy!|`|OtbbKdITaa	My daughter stores food in her diapers. I've been wondering for a long time how she's able to sneak food out of her highchair after dinner. Then, at her first birthday party a few weeks ago, I saw her putting cake in her diaper! Now, I clean her hands, clean her face, and check her diaper after she eats, lol!|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	A few weeks ago I found a sharp acorn in my son's diaper when I went to give him a bath. We had just been outside so it managed to weasel it's way in there somehow. I felt so bad for him though his skin was all scratched and red.|`|zX4nU1Rtaa	lol he didnt poop it out but my son used to hide his cookies in there and anything else he picked up he didnt want me and his dad to know about|`|62f1d0961574fb4ceb5c3f96048930aaaa	Green and blue crayons.  He's six now and still tries to eat them!|`|zQQkRR6paa	The day after Christmas I opened my little girls diaper to find a piece of giftwrap. Nice of her to wrap her little 'present' for me!|`|WlU3NFu6aa	nothing really. but one morning my daughter woke up and started coughing. she gagged and I saw something reddish sticking out of her mouth that looked like apple peel. i pulled it out and it was a whole leaf. She must have swollowed it the night beofre or something|`|SEzIkGNiaa	A barbie shoe...lol  I don't think she ate it, but just found it in her diaper.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Nothing non-food related YET, lol.    I've found pieces of my hair and whole pieces of food, though. Just makes me wonder if he ever chews anything or just swallows it right away!|`|gx4s68s8aa	Something she ate- tiny pebbles,  she was playing tea party with an older child at a picnic.  I thought nothing was in the plastic tea cups.  But I guess they decided to use the pebbles from the playground.    Something she hid in her diaper- an I-Touch,  my husband brought it home to work on (he develops video games for the I-Touch, and I-Phone) and all of sudden it was gone.  We looked for about 30 minutes.  Then I saw something sticking our of your daughter's diaper.  Thankfully the diaper was almost completely dry and there wasn't any poo-poo in it.  It was bad enough she did that with the I-Touch, but is wasn't even ours, it was his companies property.

GoJLdATfaa	Talk to your doctor and inform your doctor of what your friend experienced. Explain your concerns and ask if you can get an ultrasound to make sure. I'm pretty sure your doctor will agree to do the ultrasound. Good luck!
HF97Rs9qaa	I personally like Walmart.com because they have free shipping from sight to store and a great return policy. I got a lot of good baby items off the Walmart site.    When you buy large items shipping can add up, especially if you have to ship it back if you don't like it or there is a problem with it. With Walmart site to store you can reutrn it and get a refund at the store.    Sometimes Babies R Us has free shipping on orders over $100. But they do it as a special offer every now and then.    I would order from a place that has free shipping and most important READ THE FINE PRINT ON RETUNS AND ALSO SHIPPING COSTS AND WHAT HAPPENDS IF ITEM ARRIVES DAMAGED OR IS DEFECTIVE!!!    I ordered a rocker glider that had the holes drilled in the wrong place and the arm rest was made crooked so would not fit on and I was able to just take it back to walmart and get a refund. Had it been another site I may have had to pay to ship it somewhere and go through warranties and wait for a return or replacement. You do not want to deal with that... trust me!!!    Congratulations and goodluck!!!|`|1ezYfkX7aa	It depends on how much money you want to spend on things. If your looking to spend like 300-500 on a crib babies r us.com has beautiful cribs and if you plan on having more children to pass it down and use it may be worth it. I shop around on oldnavy.com, childrensplace.com, gap.com, walmart.com for clothes and sales. Walmart.com has alot of stuff with .97 shipping or you can get free shipping if you get it site to store and pick it up. Oldnavy has a $5 shipping fee no matter what you buy so thats not bad. =)|`|nnKtP60Oaa	furniture: craigslist.com... target.com....babiesrus.com.....    clothes: oldnavy baby gap target.......    i love babies r us because they have EVERYTHING!!!!! you should make a baby shower registry...is someone going to throw you a baby shower? they help out A LOT!!!!!!!|`|G4GnZuNaaa	http://www.toysrus.com/shop/index.jsp?ca...
sbfm5rCAaa	You will be fine. Just remember to tell them that you had a sip of juice during the night. It is only for your safety as the anaesthetic can cause nausea and obviously if you have a full stomach you could end up vomitting it up.<br>  <br>  They won't make you wait so don't worry and best of luck to you!|`|wKuQC4yTaa	you should be fine. they just don't want you puking during the operation|`|BGKjKfINaa	you have a higher chance of vomiting, but as far as safety goes I dont see what would change. Honestly, you are very likely to vomit ANYTHING in your system <br>  <br>  i hope this helps :)|`|e60754e2c47d3732e670fc3cfec1373eaa	i'm sorry but you need to tell them! it'll only be put back by a few hrs, don't worry you'll get your baby on friday xxxxx good luck chick
b8f0CfSsaa	Hi Lola!<br>  <br>  I have just started practicing the whole cervix checking thing myself. Basically you insert a clean finger in to your vagina and when you reach your cervix it will either be:<br>  <br>  1.Hard, like the end of your nose. Which indicates none fertile days or AF about to arrive.<br>  2.S.H.O.W: Soft High Open Wet. Which indicates ovulation or early pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I've only just started doing this, I am on day 3 of trying it now...apparently its a good idea to feel it every day and track changes to see where they fall in to place with your cycle. Its great because if you notice that it is hard before AF arrives and then one month it is S.H.O.W...the excitement builds!<br>  <br>  Apparently good positions to assume when doing it are: On the loo, squatting or with one leg raised on a surface.<br>  <br>  Hope that wasn't TMI!<br>  <br>  Good luck loooooooooads of baby dust!<br>  <br>  x|`|e60754e2c47d3732e670fc3cfec1373eaa	hello missus x awwww lola, i'm so excited for you! hopefully billys sperm results a few mths ago were a 1 off and you both get your much wanted wee bundle of joy soon xxxxx i can't think of anyone that deserves it more! we've been baby dancing all the time this month- so hope we're successful ;)))|`|M5fRd5v5aa	WHOOO good lluck darling hope you get your little baby now =D let us all know =D <br>  <br>  XOX BABY DUST TO EVERYONE HERE ESPECIALLY YOU HUN XOX<br>  <br>  we've been trying two years now ..... so hopefully any day now <br>  <br>  good luck to you + billy <br>  jessie xoxoxox|`|AA12347868	Hi Lola :) I've been seeing you trying for a while wishing you the best with Twins!<br>  <br>  I'm Fine I'm trying too so wish me luck, My Period was on 10 so I guess tomorrow is my 1st day :)<br>  I will let you know what happens latta<br>  Lola|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	Hi!<br>  <br>  Just wanted to give you some more support and say I've got my fingers crossed.<br>  <br>  Also I wanted to say thanks to Modern Mummy for some great info!

txbZujeRaa	That it's ok not to answer the phone the first 6 weeks, or to tell people you have to go right away.  I answered and would chat even though I needed to rest, get stuff done, etc.  I knew everyone was calling me to see if I was ok, so I felt guilty being harsh.  I wish I had told them, if they want to help, come over and pitch in!  Calling does nothing!    Also, I wouldn't have wasted my money on stupid pregnancy books, and instead studied up on baby sleep habits and how to get them on a schedule, etc.  B/c when they are here, you have no time to read thru some of these tomes on getting babies to sleep longer.|`|VY4LqfLpaa	that prematurity was more common than I thought.  our son was born at 31 weeks and I kept flipping out that he wasn't going to be ok.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	No one is a perfect parent, and trying to be one is going to set you up for failure. And to go with the flow, when something happens that changes your routine, go with it.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	That I was going to fully dilate in 5 hours so I should have asked for drugs sooner - it was too late for me.    That I wouldn't be able to deliver my boy vaginally and I was going to have to have a c-section.  I would have packed differently.  Be prepared for anything!!  Remember that your goal is to have a healthy baby - no matter how it has to be done.      What I really wish I would have known was that I was going to have to have a c-section before I went through labor and 4 hours of pushing (all w/o drugs).  It seems like I did all that work for nothing.  Not that it matters - my son is here, 10 weeks old and healthy.|`|k2heQRKFaa	How you are way more emotional after the birth than thru the whole 9 months of pregnancy and how bad post partum depression can be..I wouldnt wish that on my worst enemy.... and that getting the right medication works wonders---If it wasnt for that I dont think I would have been able to take care of my baby.. so look out for that its more common than you might think|`|AA11476782	How short 8 weeks would feel (my pitiful maternity leave)!|`|lYsrCTCwaa	Labor is the most awful excruciating pain you could ever feel in your life, but it is worth it and you forget about it once you see your baby!    Sleep when the baby sleeps.  It's ok NOT to shower everyday.  Let people help you. Don't try to be super-mom.  You don't have to pick up the baby every time she cries.  It's ok to say no to things you don't want to do....even if you did them before the baby :)|`|xue72D76aa	That registering for a ton of baby stuff is pointless - your baby will dictate what you need and what you use.  That buying baby clothes early can result in a lot of unworn clothes - the sizes and what you prefer to dress your baby in are decided once you meet your little one.  That making plans about how to raise your baby are only good to a point - you will end up breaking most of your rules regarding pacifiers, co-sleeping, where you will change a diaper, etc.  The main rule of thumb is "Go with the flow!"|`|XOtOMncwaa	I wish someone would have told me it would take about 15 minutes to go to the bathroom after I had my son, I honestly didn't know you had to do a sitz bath, and wipe and spray and rinse... ugh it was a pain... for some reason I guess I thought I would have my son and just be perfectly normal!     Also I wish someone would have told me it's okay to make mistakes... my son got a diaper rash (not my fault) it was diarrhea... and I cried for like a week, I felt like a horrible mom, now I'm more easy going with things like that once I learned there isn't such a thing as a perfect mom!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	That the "rush of love" when you see your baby isn't guaranteed :(|`|zwctZ812aa	That you can only do the best you can, and you should try to suspend expectations.  Everything you thought you were going to do as a parent isn't guaranteed, and things don't always work out like you hoped.  For example, I was insistent that my son would sleep in his bassinet rather than my bed, but for the first 2 months, he only slept in our bed.  you just do what you have to do to stay sane lol|`|0nb1rQhnaa	How sweaty I would have been in the hospital afterwards. We couldn't change the temp in the room and it took forever for someone to bring a fan. Also, I wished I knew sooner that I could have put a do not disturb sign on the door so I could have had a few hours of uninterupted sleep.|`|RcHO6d3Eaa	That you'll never want to put your baby down or leave the room he's in and if you do, you'll feel panicky (well, I did). But that's just nature's way of trying to make sure you look after your baby and it's easier to go with it and seem a bit mad than fight it and be miserable.    That labour doesn't hurt as much as I had expected, but I wouldn't do it for fun.     That baths with a bit of lavender oil in them are wonderful - really wonderful - for those bruised/ grazed bits and you shouldn't be afraid they'll hurt because they don't.    That any piece of clothing that doesn't open right up in a really straight-forward way will not be used.    That baby boys can pee right over their heads.    That all the rubbish about the right way to bath a baby or the right way to change a nappy is just that, rubbish, and as long as you get it done it doesn't matter how you do it.    That babies make a surprising amount of noise at night when they're asleep (jungle noises, even).    And that breastfeeding is harder than you think it's going to be, but once you get it sorted you can't believe you ever found it hard.|`|EccBqsntaa	I'm no mother and I don't plan to be one for awhile  But my god mom had a baby almost 3 years ago. I wish someone told me that the baby wasn't going to come exactly on her due date! And that the baby would come at any random time! She was due on July 3. I was super excited. Nobody told me that the baby wasn't coming on July 3 actually. I waited for a whole week after waiting 9 months(They told us the same day they found out). They induced her and were going to due a C-section on July 11 around 8. My mom was going to the hospital after she dropped my dad off at 6:30 am. I couldn't sleep after my mom told me she was leaving and she'd be back around 10. My god dad called around 7 to tell me that they did an emergency c-section and the baby was here! Nobody told me that I would cry tears of joy either! Or that he would be so strong at birth(he held onto my finger while I was holding him)
hZWup7xXaa	it could be possible that your pregnant. and yes acne is a pregnancy symptom but it cause also be caused by a hormone change. hope this helps and good luck :)|`|Lx5vYz9jaa	yes acne is a symptom, but i honestly don't think thats till a little later on. 12 days is a bit too soon.  I discovered I was preggo 3 weeks after conception, and my first tell tell sign was very very sore breast, even more sore than when I'm on my period.|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	yes, but its probably too soon for it to be a symptom of pregnancy, its probably from stress, wait until at least the week your period is due to take another test, but for the most accurate results, wait until the day of or a few days after your period was due.|`|htSZsds7aa	You could be, but if u are young (teen) then its possible its all hormonal. Please dont have nay more sex until u are married.
BWUlksmmaa	I've read that male sperm swim faster but die quicker while female sperm swim slower but die slower also.  What this means (in terms of an old wives tale...not proven) that you are more likely to have a boy if you have sex when you are ovulating (because it will swim ahead of the female ones and hit your egg first).  You will have a girl if you have sex before you ovulate (because it will be sitting there alive, waiting for the egg to be produced).  Hope that makes sense and good luck!|`|d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	i once read about a diet, but i don't believe it, and anyway it sounds like a very unhealthy diet... maybe look it up on google<br>  <br>  whatever you will have treasure it...
N9Ewyo4Saa	Congrats on the twins! BUT! Kayden and Kaitlyn are soooo trendy and popular rite now I wouldnt use them and i also would consider not using matchy names for them!!|`|laVH1Bz3aa	if you run under the assumption that most of the people who post on this site are not pregnant, then you might have a unique name; everyone is saying Kayden is one of their favorites these days. I wouldn't be surprised if its a big name when your child gets older.<br>  Kayden Michael<br>  Kayden Alexander<br>  Kayden James<br>  <br>  I vote for Caitlin, but I'm not into "unique" names and spellings. Lily-Rose is cute too though. Caitlin is a pretty common name among my age group (I'm 20) - and I don't just mean that particular spelling - so if you are going on what is most unique you should pick Lily-Rose|`|k9YaLawCaa	I don't like Kayden, I think of a girl, and a nickname KAY. No---- How about Hayden or Kevin or Tyden.<br>  Lily-Rose is nice, No Kaitlyn if you're using Kayden....again no on that name. Remember your child is the one who has to live with it and kids can be so cruel!|`|JU351q6Naa	I like the name Kayden but i also prefer it spelt with a C. <br>  I have always liked the name Cayden Collin. <br>  <br>  Dont use Rose as a middle name it is so overused and common.

yCwPxulYaa	I had my baby 5 months ago and it still hurts me.  And yes, it is still hard to get in the mood.  Just make it fun and take it slow.  It will take some time to get back to normal but it does get better.    Try the the KY his and hers.  Lubeing it up always makes it feel better!  (HAHA!  I can't believe I just said that but really, it does)|`|hXoUFWL1aa	I had a 4th degree tear and it still takes a few minutes for sex to not feel so umcomfortable. My son is 3 months old, too! I find that if I don't think about it hurting its much better.|`|ui7xf4JYaa	My baby is 4 months old and sex is just staring not to hurt! Its normal. Wait till your comfortable, I did not and kind of resented my husband because it hurt so bad and he did it anyway. Even though I said he could. I will wait next time.|`|nnKtP60Oaa	i had a 10 pound baby and 2nd degree tearing.........i was good 2 go at 6 weeks........but make sure you lube up before u get down....|`|GPW6HUZFaa	I had my daughter 7 months ago, and had stitches and I still feel it.  It still hurts sometimes where I was stitched up.  I'm just now getting to the point where I'm not so nervous anymore.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	It was uncomfortable at first. Being in the mood helps a lot as well as some good lubricant, not KY. It felt normal again after a couple months of practice.|`|zQWNb6neaa	After my first child it took 8 weeks, a glass of wine, and some KY Liquid.|`|zwctZ812aa	It was uncomfortable for me the first time after having my son, but I dealt with it.  It isn't really uncomfortable anymore, but he is 3 months old and I can't ever get in the mood.  I just don't want it at all.  I get this almost sick feeling when my boyfriend starts hinting at me.  I think it's just hormones...I hope it goes better for you than it did for me!|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I had stitches after I had my son, and sex hurt for months after I gave birth. I found that using lots of lube like KY really really helped. He is 16 months old now, and I have not had any problems with pain for a while. You just need to give it time and it will slowly get better.|`|A89ezcg5aa	I hated sex until my c-section scar stopped being painful to the touch, which was like 3 months.  It's going to take time.  I don't know what a vaginal birth is like, but no matter how you delivered, sex is never fun directly after a baby is born.|`|lGSUToFQaa	it does hurt briefly, but it took me a while after wards to want to have sex, the first time vag birth 9weeks, this time c-section and gall bladder immediately after, my hubby didn't want to take a chance so we waited 10 weeks|`|VY4LqfLpaa	first time for me was when our son was 12 weeks old.  it didn't start feeling "somewhat" good till he was about 4-5 months old...|`|XOtOMncwaa	You WILL experience a little discomfort for a while where you had the stitches... my sons a year old and sometimes I'm still a little sensitive down there... it's normal... actually getting in the mood helps, it's a little more comfortable that way... just spice it up and take it easy... I was a nervous wreck the first few times I had sex after my son, but just think about other things and not the stitches!|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	Believe it or not 7 weeks is not that long, you are lucky to have healed that quickly! I had twins vaginally and I had an epesiotomy that tore and I didn't completely heal for 8 months! My babies are almost 10 months now and sex is still uncomfortable. And I still very rarely get in the mood.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	I waited till 8 weeks and my stitches to heal, I even put off my 6 week apt till then since I was terrified to have sex again too. It didn't really hurt but it didn't feel normal. He's 11 months and sometimes if the position is off I still get pain, almost like I'm tearing again.|`|AA10405438	This is normal and you will get the feelings back.  Just try to be patient.|`|CZLpTU8iaa	It'll get easier the more you do it! Think or do something to get in the mood. Go somewhere with your partner and come home and have sex! Just don't think about it!

Mainly call.<br>  Have your parent's ever read your text messages? If so, what was your response? What was their response? Did you get into trouble for what they read? My dad has.. cos It went off and it was sitting on the table. It was just something about plans for the weekend so it didn't mean anything. I don't write anything through text or msn anything I wouldn't tell my Dad really..If it something secret (hardly EVER) i would speak to them in person.. There isn't much I would hide. I can't think of anything.. I'm pretty open with my family. I have alot of privacy and I think I take it for granted some times.<br>  Could you ever give up texting?<br>  Definately! MSN?

0zkCGlNUaa	That sounds perfectly fine. My 3 month old triplets wake around 7. Then they nap around 9:30. Then again at around 2.  Then they make fall asleep for a cat nap around 5 or 6  They are in bed by 8.  That seems perfectly fine too me.  Babies sleep a lot at this age =]|`|Amkmles0aa	babbys sleeps 18 to 23 h a day  i know just 24 h in a day|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I have followed the notion that babies are ready for a nap after being awake for about two hours.  Obviously, there's some flexibility in this, and you should watch for you cues that your baby is tired, but in my experience, that is basically right.    If he's sleeping through the night, then it sounds like he's taking the exact right amount of naps for him.|`|zwctZ812aa	My 3 month old wakes up at 8, naps from about 9:30 to 10, then from about 1 to 2:30ish, then again from about 5-6:30.  He goes to bed at 8:30, and wakes up every 2 hours.|`|rvoo4rBjaa	At that age he is growing in leaps and bounds and his little body tells him how much sleep he needs.Some day in the near future you will wish he was napping LOL|`|pvH3oHRfaa	If he's tired, let him sleep, it won't do him any harm. If he's sleeping well in the night, then it's no problem. If he started not sleeping in the night, then you might want to stop him sleeping so much in the day.    When my daughter was three months, she was sleeping about every hour and a half for an hour. So pretty much the same as your son. She still takes two or three naps a day at 6 months, and sleeps 7 til 7 at night.    I would just make the most of it!|`|r5R2nstRaa	its okay, my son and daughter do the same thing. my son would sleep through the night, wake at 8am, nap at 12, nap at 3, nap at 7, and go to bed at about 10! now that he's 2 almost 3, he take 1 nap. your child is just a good sleeper. my daughter is doing the same thing. just be lucky! not many people get this!|`|aJTBF7opaa	If your really concerned about it, call the pediatrician and ask the front desk they will answer or refer for the doctor to call you.

Trust me enjoy your time now. I have one 6 years old she drive me crazy|`|EenbVs8Oaa	Our son is 10 months old and takes 3 naps a day still.

slILtaEiaa	Has the pain or blood loss increased at all? I think its more of a concern when it increases in frequency or amount. Otherwise, it sounds like your body getting back to where it was. However, I would recommend waiting to TTC for at least one full cycle. I know its hard, but wouldn't you rather wait one cycle and have a healthy bean than risk a problem? I think doctors say 6-8 weeks to start TTC again... if you are very concerned, call your doctor or midwife and see if what you are experiences is normal. I would think it is, but it can't hurt to check with someone knowledgeable! <br>  <br>  And, I'm very sorry for your loss *hugs*|`|VRSUyeqbaa	i went through the same thing you did. you will have slight cramping as your body is trying to heal. i would suggest waiting at least 3 cycles to see if your periods are regular. i had a D & C a few years ago and my period is just now getting right again.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm so sorry for your loss.

6FY2FMwLaa	Ive got 5 children and when my twins were born I had 4 under the age of 21/2, <br>  hard slog but think its fair to say ive had plenty of experience, I think Ive yet to see a baby grow at any size that actually fits a baby perfectly!! unless they are growing out of them and their wee cutey toes are poking at the feet ends,bless, and if moneys tight you cut the feet of & tack a hem at the ankle and put sox on with them<br>  For the 1st 3 months babies live in baby grows except for the odd trip out until mum finds her feet and has time to lift her head!<br>  I wouldn't buy beyond the 3 month stage just now, & gift buyers are usually clued up to the fact that you will be well prepared for the early months and will buy clothes for 3/6 & 6/9.<br>  You don't have to go over board with the clothes just now coz day by day you'll get into a routine & using the washing machine when babies sleeping will be part of it, their clothes are so small & dry so quickly over the radiator you'll never be short of clean ones, & theres no better smell than the one that comes from backdoor dried baby clothes,<br>  all the best for the future<br>  xxxxxxxxxx|`|f6d23f05020d008e311e1a8124ad390eaa	Don't get a ton of 0-3 month clothes, because they can grow out of those much more quickly than you'd think. In fact, my son was BORN not fitting into that size. Also, you'll find that it's easiest to keep them in onesies at that stage, so all the adorable little sweaters, shoes, and pants people buy newborns are probably going to be worn only once or twice, if at all. I'd stock up more on 3-6 month and older clothes.|`|lhqM4qhxaa	for the meantime you can buy the adjustable baby clothes which you have only tight it by side, buy little bit big coz babies grows fast, usually if you buy the clothes for 0 to 3 mos in one month only they can use it, buy like 18pcs of upper clothes, bibs,sacks, cover for hands(one dozen each), coz u have to change ur baby clothes at least 3 time a day depends how is ur environment.<br>  i recommend dont buy a signature clothes(but still its up to you), just buy cheap but with quality coz uur baby wont wear it for maybe a month coz they grows verry fast.<br>  coz my child his a boy hhe grown very fast its like we bought for 3 mos size, hes so big that wee have to buy for 5 mos size.<br>  or if you have relatives or friends that they have old clothes for their babies u can ask them also so you dont nid also to spend( if its ok for).|`|MtC3CWZraa	I was due yesterday and haven't bought anything larger than 0-3 because it's impossible to guess how fast your baby will move between sizes. I don't want to be stuck with weather inappropriate clothes that my baby can't wear. I have some larger items, but only because I was given them.<br>  <br>  The age sizes are based on the assumption that your child will be in a certain eight range at those ages.  Here's a chart with info on that: <a href="http://babyclothes.about.com/od/babysizeandagecharts/a/usizechart.htm" rel="nofollow">http://babyclothes.about.com/od/babysize...</a><br>  <br>  The only reason to buy anything smaller than newborn is if you have a preemie.|`|ZHkhNY0Saa	hey there you are planning well! <br>  i would buy more 3-6 months baby grows because the last thing you want is too many oversized baby grows most people i know who buy new born clothes have had to take them back as never fitted the baby i would buy 14 0-3 months enough for one per day for two weeks this covers the baby being changed a lot also but if you have enough for just ovber a week then the washing will be fine to ensure you always have enough clothes my mom bought for my neice 3-6 months for my niece and within a month of being born she was wearing those although a little long on the feet and the sleeves were folded back a little bit they had enough room compared to the 0-3 month ones <br>  hope this helps also while young i would stick to many baby grows with some hand knitted cardigans if possible for added warmth also too add some colour etc if all baby grows are white they can go in the same wash during the week!!!|`|m0DgqEcjaa	i only brought newborn (not tiny baby)<br>  <br>  then 0-3 (i have a few bits)<br>  <br>  3-6months also.<br>  <br>  try not to go over the top, i did with my daughter and she didn't wear half the clothes, you forget people buy you clothes for gifts too!|`|1bnhwGACaa	i wouldnt buy that much newborn clothes 0-3 and 3-6 and 6-9 i am slowly getting my stuff together i have alot of gowns they are the best and last for awhile my youngest wore them till he was 1 so i would invest in a few|`|H0fXySX9aa	in all honesty with my girls and they were 7 pounds 0 to 3 months fitted new born were to small|`|sV4knlUfaa	I recommend talking to all your family and friends, they are very helpful on this and not only will they provide advice, they will normally buy the required baby grows, creams, cots etc for you and save you the worry of buying the right thing. People who have had kids, know how hard it is and generally help whenever they can.<br>  Be careful not to go OTT on the 0-3 months stuff. Your baby will be constantly covered in food and dribble and spending big money is not advised. Get a few good quality (cotton only, no nylon) baby grows and before you know it, your baby will have grown out of them and be in the next size up.<br>  It is very tough but very rewarding, good luck

AA11631559	You could be pregnant as this is what happened to me. I planned my pregnancy. My last period was 11 December 2007 I was most fertile round about Christmas 24th 26th and now I have a 5 month old baby girl.<br>  <br>  I suggest if you don't want a baby try with the morning after pill. To do a pregnancy test would be too early you would not have enough HCG yet.Leave it a couple of weeks then buy a home pregnancy test like Clearblue.|`|ptx1SrcTaa	The chances are about 50/50.  Since it was last night they have a thing called, "Plan B" which can be taken within 72 hours of the sexual act itself.  So you have another day and a half at least.  You can get it from most pharmacies.  This will give you a better chance of not getting pregnant.  It will greatly reduce the chance you are pregnant|`|iqXReM3aaa	Of course you could be pregnant. STill a bit early for a pregnancy test. wait another week or so first.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Of course but we can't tell you for sure. Wait two weeks and take a test.|`|g2QUNwZzaa	ya. ur pregrant. for sure|`|3cdb0Tmraa	check on an ovulation calculator to see if it was during your fertile time. just remember sperm can live inside you for up to 5 days.. but if you had sex 2 days after you finished ovulating you should be in the safe. any time before or during ovulation is a high chance. You will only realy be able to test in about 2-3 weeks from now to see if you are with a HPT, about 5 days after your supposed to start your period, if you miss it. All the best hope this helps... :)|`|BWUlksmmaa	Yes you are in the peak time in your cycle to fall pregnant so if some went in of course there is a chance of falling pregnant...thats how babies are made right?!

G0wXt0mlaa	I know it's hard, but just accept that she doesn't love you that much. What you're making the mistake of doing is putting your mother in high regard; Don't look at it like your mother should love you. Hate her. Hate her for being a bad mother. Don't feel sorry for yourself because you're not loved by one, stupid individual. Just keep in mind, when ever she says something like 'you're so useless' just say 'ok' or 'whatever' and tell yourself '**** you mom' <br>  <br>  trust me I know what I'm talking about; and dying is NEVER the answer. If you live through really tough periods of depression and thinking about suicide, but don't kill yourself, then you will look back and be glad. You  don't need to be loved by her, you'll find someone who will love you back eventually. When you're angry at her for choosing favorites or whatever, just make silent vows to treat her like **** when she's old. <br>  You're trying to hard to cling onto love; which causes you to be sad because of her not returning it. You need to let it go. Cease to love her anymore and I promise you'll get over it (then again, I'm a guy...) <br>  <br>  I hope you understand what I'm saying. Just let go of any love you have for her, and you will become a stronger person because of it.<br>  <br>  Also listen to some hardcore, that always helps >:]<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: that girl above me knows what she's talking about too, and her approach (if your mom isn't abusive[I automatically connected those things because of my experience]) seems more girly and would probably work better for you; but if all else fails, then my approach always works.|`|6iLDFgj2aa	Do what she tells you and then just go up to your room and don't come out until you have to, don't act like your in a bad mood but when your mum asks you why you were in your room for so long and didn't socialise just say ''Cos I want to have some time to myself and you never want to spend time with me so I don't see the point, but I wish you would because when I'm older and I move out your going to wonder where all that time went because we didn't get on.''

9TfKeq9Eaa	It's crazy, this is my exact situation. I work nights from 8-4:30 am. My boyfriend works day 8-6. I have a 20 month old and another one on the way. I am constantly worn out! I usually get to sleep from about 5 or 5:30 until my son wakes up around 8 or 9. And then we take a nap from around 12 until 3 or 4. It really is hard! Especially while being pregnant! I don't have many tips for you because we are struggling with this ourselves. Some things we do are, keep my son up late. he doesn't go to bed until at least 10 or 11 so he will sleep in later, therefore i get more sleep. My boyfriend goes and sleeps in our spare room when i get home so he wont wake me up when he leaves. That's pretty much it! I don't think it can get any easier. I am also really nervous about what the future holds with another baby on the way. I know we can do it though. I really want to eventually get a work from home job like medical coding (I am already in the medical field). But that requires schooling and training first. Well good luck fellow momma! Just know you're not alone.|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	so if you husband kept you son up all night long so he would sleep during the day, when would you husband get any sleep..?<br>  <br>  I would greatly think about part time day care during the day so you can sleep.. yes, it will cut into you income,, but what else can you do..?<br>  <br>  you may not like it, but you may have to change jobs.  but then you will still have to think about day care as both of you will have to work during the day,.,<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|d8fSVX23aa	I am so sorry for you as you are only a mere mortal and not made to survive such things in the long run.

Get support from family and friends to help you as much as possible while things are this hard.

Cx5Zo7IIaa	If she won't stay in the crib or pack and play buy her a big girl bed and some rails, bumper the rails until she gets used to them being there then remove the bumpers and after a while try it without the rails if she doesn't fall out of bed that's good but if she does just put the rails back on.
TQW5E6olaa	I would also take his threats seriously and not let him take my child. He's proven you can't trust him, so don't. Let him threaten you, just like you can't do a darn thing if if he takes your child and refuses to hand him over, he can't do anything if you do it...Document his threats, very important for future custody hearings.|`|G2auAv1Saa	In all honesty haven't you done the same thing he has threatened to do to you?

He has the same rights to the child as you. Please look at it objectively.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I wouldn't let him go until custody and visitation has been established.  With the threats, no way.

You can keep him and refuse to let him take him!|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	listen to me very carefully  if you let that child go with him  he has every right to go to a judge and get a speedy order of temporary custody  You will be placing all the cards in HIS HANDS  This will reflect negatively on you in court  this could go on for a long time battle  then the judge says "kid is fine with dad and we see no reason to place him with mom again"  Take heed|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Listen to your heart. If it tells you not to let the son go then don't. Tell him that because of the threats that he has made you don't want him to take Same anywhere. Listen to his threats. My sister didn't take her ex's seriously and he took their son for 6 months before he had to give him back. It was the worst 6 months of her life. Tell him that if his mother would like to see your son that she is more than welcome to do it in your home where you can supervise.|`|lzivF4Idaa	he wouldnt get my child out of the house without a fight.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	I wouldn't let him go. If he wants to see his son he can go and see him at your house. Go to the courts and try to work out a  custody arrangement. then if he takes your son you can take legal action.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	do not let your little one go!   im sorry for what u have been through, but that make is a liar, and he obviously has no problems with hurting u!  u can draw up an agreement that states where the child is to reside, and what u want for access, and both sign it and it can be made a legally binding document until u go to court.  But it is true that he can take your boy and not give him back until court- and that can take a very long time!!! i was in a similar situation a few months back- i was advised to limit my time shopping along, as even if my little one was in the stroller and i turned around to grab something off the shelf, if her dad took her there would be nothing i could do.  Hold onto your boy with both hands and do not let him go in the car of other people unless u are sure you can trust the 100%  I hope things work out for you!! good luck!!|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	If I were in your situation, I would not let my son go with him. Odds are, nothing will happen, but why take a chance with your baby. I would just explain your concerns to your husband, he will probably get mad, but it's better than him taking off with your kid.|`|fHjSonssaa	This is really trick if you ask me.  If your husband is someone who think is actually capable of taking our son away (doesn't he want what's best for Sam?- to be able to be with Mommy?)...anyway, if you actually think he's even remotely capable of this, I would not let him go.  Couldn't this actually be considered kidnapping if he doesn't bring him back even though he is the father?  Perhaps I am wrong in a legal sense.    If you think that your husband just said these things out of anger (we all have said thing...sometimes really stupid things out of anger)....and you trust him, then shouldn't he be able to see his grandma, too?  Safety first- hands down.  Don't you think he just wants to take Sam there to see his grandma?  Only you can truly answer this queestion because if you ask me, this is all about judging character- and you are the only one who know your soon to be ex-husband and his mother.    That said, err on the side of caution.  I would hold on tight to to my son if I was even remotely weary.  On the other hand, if I trusted my husband (in terms of our son, not fidelity) I would let him go.|`|jrVlzffeaa	I would take it seriously and not let him see his son unless you're there, that way you can be at ease and it'll be good for Sam to see his mummy and daddy together (don't argue in front of him). Good luck and make sure that when your cheating husband turns up that you look smoking hot, so he knows what he's missing and ruined!! lol Xx|`|agTCqkLDaa	If he had threatened to take my child (which in your case he had) then no, I wouldn't let my child go.    It's not *you* being petty.  He's the one who made that threat and whether or not he said it out of anger is moot.  He shouldn't have made the threat and if you have ANY suspicion that he might take your child, you keep him with you until there's a court order.    Don't be mean about it, but say "Listen, your threat really concerned me and I think it's best if you want to see our son that you come over here, but until a court order has reached an agreement, it's not in his best interest to go with you."|`|JsqMSU9Haa	yikes.  tough decision.  sorry you have to deal with this bullsh**.      can you offer to go with them?  i wouldnt let him go.  id either come up with some fake story or just tell him that he threatened you about taking your son away and now your scared.  record the conversations though.  maybe you could have him and his mom at your house?  i'd make it clear youre so called paranoia is due to his words, not something you just thought up.  but no, i wouldnt let him go alone if i didnt have to.|`|9LWuWHiMaa	if you are scared tell your husband. honey let me tell you something when ppl are angry they tend to do and say nasty things. he was angry. i am pretty sure that you amy have said some things yourself because you were angry. the fact is unless you have full custody or some court order he is entitled to spending time with his child. Go hi tech. give you son a cell phone with a gps tracking device in it.  that might sound strange but we live in a crazy world and you have to protect your son. another route is to tell him your concerns and ask that he wait until custody have been finalized before taking the child away. i suggest you report such a threat to a police officer so if you do decide to send your son, this would be admissible in court.   you have a tough decision to make. but i would tell him to wait on the custody hearing and i would notify the police that he threatens to abduct the child|`|7HzfgRmwaa	absolutely not!!!!! Do not take threats about taking your child from you lightly. That man will need to either have supervised visits by you for a certain amount of time or not see Sam until the divorce is final and there is a custody agreement in place. Sorry - he messed up when he said that. Period. Let him know that. And you aren't hurting Sam by not letting him go with his father. You would be hurting poor Sam if you let him go with his daddy and his daddy took his mommy away by keeping him from you for a period of time. Be smart lady! :) Keep your boy with you!|`|eya1WDS4aa	Well you have two problems. If you let him take him it may be a long while before you get him back, or if you dont let him take your son it could look very bad in a custody battle. I would try to get into family court right away and get cousity right away|`|jLYTKr33aa	I would take his threats seriously.  Allow him to see his son at your house whenever he wants, but do not let him take the baby anywhere.  Good luck.

WwCBomTMaa	Wait a couple of weeks and take a pee test. And always learn from your mistakes. Pregnancy should not be your biggest concern. You might want to go to your gyno and get tested for STD's. Some can be deadly.|`|hjWOmSYoaa	ok first...go get some damn birth control. a child is a precious thing and it needs a good atmosphere around it not a stressful one.     second... stop hanging out with older boys. soon your going to regret it because no matter what they say... they are lying. i do not care if he says he swears on his mothers grave. LIE! Have more respect for yourself and do whats best for YOU, to help YOUR life.    third...THE PROBLEM... USUALLYYY a week AFTER your last period is the LEAST conceptive days. meaning you shouldnt have a high chance of getting pregnant. Now, keep in mind all girls are different. the pregnancy test can be used a week after your missed period. yes you have to wait till your next period.     now please please take better care of your body. if you have anymore questions or need someone to talk to... heres my email got2bme_06@yahoo.com. email me. ive already had a child and been through all these things.
xJwLz0Mzaa	Listen to your Doctor number one! It likely will take about 3 months maybe 4 to get your cycles regulated...then talk to your doctor and let he or she know they have regulated...this won't necessarily stay working after you discontinue them though...you might go back to being irregular like I did. My opinion because some of what I was told from a midwife is that doctors use this as a way to more correctly and accurately "time" when you concieved and how far along you are when you do conceive. I have 5 children and cycles that range from 18 to 38 days....I'm very irregular. I found when trying to conceive the best way to do it was to quit trying to "fix everything" quit trying to "time everything" and just have intercourse on a regular basis...I mean like daily so that you have live sperm in your womb during the whole process or ovulation. Even then it might not take right away but at least it will increase your chances. Sex is so much more enjoyable when yoru not trying anyway...enjoy it now, everyday! because later through all the breast feeding, diaper changes, mini naps and screaming babies, you'll likey not get it very often anyway!!! LOL   But they're OH SO WORTH IT!!!!  Love being mom!!!|`|4WNeBRjVaa	Try a couple of months on the pills. I know they say you should be off your pills for three months before trying to concieve. So good luck- i hope everything works out for you!|`|dcLQAdhLaa	i would just take them until you are ready to get pregnant or atleast for a few months and make sure you have another method of birth control.|`|4DoXomHZaa	Most doctors tell you that your cycle will be messed up for a few months when you come off the pill. For him to say you'll get pg right away was very irresponsible for him to say. Healthy couples oinly have a 20% shor any month.    I would recommend getting a second opinion. Not all doctors are good ones and they certainly should not be telling you things that are not medically accurate.|`|mgiJVjaKaa	I would say to follow your doctor's advice. If he told you take it for a few months, then do that.     I do not know much about adenomyosis so I can't help you there. But if you're just concerned about your cycles being weird, and your doctor is ok with it, then you could just let them be weird while you're TTC.|`|L982MxUvaa	This happened to a friend of mine. She tried for a while to get pregnant, but was never successful. Her doctor put her on birth control for 3 months... as soon as she got off of them she got pregnant that month.  Good Luck!
xzh8r0jIaa	i think the cramps are the baby settling down, i have been like that for the past week, im going into my 38 th wk.     and from what i understand, once you start getting the labor contractions the baby is real still because he is engaged and doesnt have much room to move around|`|eV5E9MhUaa	Probably just your muscles not wanting to be stretched any more! Usually, while in labor the baby doesn't move. It could kick, but once your in active labor the baby starts working to get out to. It's instinct. :)|`|dxTwHB1yaa	It's common for the baby to slow in movements when labor is close.     Also every women dilates and effaces at a different pace. They tried to induce me and I still wouldn't budge above 4 cm.|`|ZUlnZvaWaa	It is normal.|`|MRw1uEuLaa	no, it won't kick  but it'll claw it's way out|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	When you start going into labor the baby's movements decrease.
BWUlksmmaa	Pregnancy symptoms are very similar to period symptoms.  Not always, but usually a HPT would have shown positive if you were pregnant by now (a week after a missed period). There are many things that can delay your period and if you have convinced yourself that you are pregnant then this is one of the main reasons, you trick your body into believing it.  I hope for your sake that you are but don't hang all of your hopes on it...|`|MtC3CWZraa	There's a good chance its implantation bleeding at this stage.|`|GRFvENovaa	i would go see the doctor of hospital asap just to get checked out my partnet is 40 weeks +3 now and every time we go up to hospital they are very welcomeing good luck and hope every thing is ok <br>  <br>  try not to worry 2 much
264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	Hmmm, it could quite possibly be normal, but then again maybe not.  I am still breastfeeding my daughter (now 1 year)  I got my period back about 6 months or so after I had her.  The flow was VERY heavy the first few days, then it went normal and lasted roughly 5 days.  I did get cramps, not too bad though, but I still had to take some IB profin the first day or so.    Just to be safe you should make an appointment with your ob/gyn.  The thing that concerns me is you are saying it's coming every 2-3 weeks which leads me to believe maybe something didn't heal up quite right.  Mine has come every 1 1/2 months or so, it's still pretty irregular, but it is definitely at least a month before I get another one.|`|pMzq6B3paa	That same thing happens to me and my son is 2 and a half. I had to go on birth control pills and that's the only way I was able to control it. I was scared I thought there was something wrong with me, but my gyno said it was common, but still your case can be different, go see your doctor.|`|aba81bf0dd1e368904161a0c15faf44caa	You might want to see your ob-gyn... sounds like your hormones are messed up.  Pregnancy can do that to you.    It takes about a year for your body to get straightened out after birth, longer if you breastfeed
92318d2de373ecc807b1a2e15fbad4b6aa	Don't spank him...it's not your job...it's your parents. I think you handled it right though by telling your parent that you won't watch him again...they should discipline him before he is in your care. If he acts up take things away or call your parents.|`|kHvJ0v3caa	I agree with the person above who said the age difference was a big thing to look at.  Initially...it really isn't your job as a sibling to do this, but if parents or anyone else is away and they tell you to do something that you know is okay, then it's a different story.  I would say that the spanker has to have a very good judgment on when and how to do things.  But mainly the age difference is a key component.  If you were 14 or up (as said above) it would be okay if a child was really younger.  But if you are only a couple of years apart, i think it's a whole different story.|`|9LWuWHiMaa	No.   older does not mean wiser.any parent would agree that they have had to punish their older children for things that they knew were wrong and did anyway.   discipline in terms of spanking should be done by parents. spanking should not be out of fruastration or anger it should be done only to correct a persistent poor behavior.   older children will use it out of anger or even as a way a bullying. so no i dont agree.    what your parents should do is set some punishments for these behaviors and let him understand that whether they are home or not these are the consequences and he must obey you. they should also discipline him of he refuses to be obedient when you try to discipline him. he does not see you as an authority figure and your parents need to let him know that you are the person in charge and if he disobeys you there will be serious consequences.|`|WL7nKDplaa	No, it is not right to spank your brother. If you would spank your brother then you should not be babysitting him. There is no compromise. You can not spank him End of Story. It is up to your parents about what to do.|`|I0cTKCCWaa	it isn't your place to step in and do your parent's job and address their failings as parents by disciplining your sibling(s).....    it also isn't your place as their child to say no if they ask you to watch them.    you gotta love those contradictions life sometimes throws at you....especially the ones you have no control over.    unless they address his behaivor when you're watching him and let him know in no uncertain terms that it is not acceptable to act out when you keep him, then you are pretty much stuck in a bad situation.    depending on your age and the age of your younger siblings, if you leave marks on them or otherwise hurt them in your efforts to discipline them, it could be viewed as assault and/or child abuse or endangerment by the authorities....both as it pertains to you, as the one doing it........ and to your parents as to questioning their judgement and compentency as parents by leaving a younger sibling with you when they know/knew you were trying to discipline them.    best to find a better way....sometimes there isn't one..... you just have to deal with the hand you're dealt.....    why are your parents away from home so much anyway? work would be the only acceptable answer....if it's for any other reason then they, or at least one of them, needs to stay home and handle their business as parents instead of leaving you there to do it for them while they do other things.    you father is right not to like you spanking him....it isn't your place or you responsibility......|`|o2LoiWehaa	yes it ok i still get spanked by my older sister and im 12 and my sister she is 20|`|SEzIkGNiaa	No, spanking is the parents job.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	No, it's not okay to spank younger siblings. If your little brother is out of control, your parents need to handle that. You're not yet equipped to spank properly. Let your parents deal with it.|`|sxecXFgraa	I think it depends on how old you are and how old your little brother is.  But if your parents don't spank him, then no, you shouldn't either.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	I think responsibility lies with the parent|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	If your brother doesn't mind you, your parents shouldn't leave him with you. I don't think it's the job of older siblings to do anything with the younger ones. For instance, I have a 10yr old son and a 4 1/2mo old daughter. By the time my son gets 17, my daughter will be 7 but I wouldn't get him to babysit unless it was necessary. Plus, I would pay him for his time. It wouldn't be fair not to because if I hired a babysitter, I'd have to pay her so it'd be wrong not to pay my son.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	No, it is never alright. Your father is correct, it is not up to you.|`|f2af31dd361317fd8f47977d75618507aa	I would. It's your right as the first born to pound his punk azz. The only way he'll learn lifes lessons is a few atomic elbows|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	I think it depends on how old the older sibling is. I dont think it would be right if you where say 8 and your brother was 6. Now if you where 14 or up and your 6 year old brother wasnt being good I dont see anything wrong with it IF your parents agree. If they dont agree then it isnt your place. If you are the one watching them and they do something wrong they need to understand that then. Also you shouldnt hit as hard as your parents, and if your parents use a belt I dont think you should.
9LWuWHiMaa	it depends on the temperament of the child. children are not idiots so when a rule is made tell the child and then let the child know the consequences. come up with a consequence together. in my home we have standards. my child knows what the standard are and he knows th consequences. he tends to be defiant at times. if he refuses to take timeout he gets spanked but it is not beating him to a pulp it is one slap hard enough for him to feel but soft enough to not cause scar. trust me it works. the standards chart are specifically for behavior issues.  chore charts encourage him to do his chores  i praise him for every good thing that he does. when he chooses to be obedient i reward him. even if he is good one hundred times for the day. a simple hug, a kiss, we pray and thank god for helping him to choose to be obedient. that is my method.  i want my son to choose to be obedient. so my husband and i came up with the consequences.   before we leave the house we have talks about how i want him to behave. there is no arly age for teaching a child self control. he knows when to be playful and when to sit quietly and wait on mommy. it takes time and consistency but it is possible.   set boundaries and enforce them no one book can teach you that because every child learns differently.|`|s1zitZMOaa	I praise behavior that is good and pick my battles carefully. Time outs for bad behavior, logic when it's appropriate, and ignoring behavior when that's appropriate. I generally don't read many parenting books but I did like Alan Kazdin's The Kazdin Method for Parenting the Defiant Child. My child's not what I would call defiant, but it's a very reasonable book.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	There's a ton of information coming out of england.

I've tried tapping hands, he doesn't listen.  I've tried raising my voice, he doesn't listen.  He'll stand on the chair and say, "Sit down, now!"  So, he knows what he's doing, he just doesn't care to listen.  I'm at my wits end!|`|Btsctjydaa	Methane gas.|`|t1ORKMxHaa	I just use one of those hand gun bb guns.

Sometimes they think its a game,, thats when you start aiming for the face..|`|uGFzzLYWaa	I don't know of any books that can help you, but what does your brother do that makes your father want to spank him? How old is he? Is he a baby?     If you really want to punish a child, take away the TV and the video games. Works like a charm.
426c7861dc77ee80668e47afb0150a53aa	Why can't you just leave the loser alone, he will never be just yours and please give up that dream that it will be.  You want him to choose, can't you see that he already has, why is it you young women are so stuck on what you think is love until you will throw your life away with the bull.  So he moved in with this other female, they have obviously been sleeping together (can we say STDs) and you think because you have his son you have the upper hand - no.  You have a son, a child that God has given you to raise, raise your son and leave the loser alone, what is happening now will be going on for the rest of your life with your baby's daddy and you don't need it and shouldn't want to play the mind games.  Move on Babygirl, move on, you can do it without the extra baggage.  The only positive thing that you will be taking from this relationship is  your son - take him and live a wonderful life.   God Bless.|`|VyMIFe6Vaa	Oh no you should tell no and maybe if he straightens up and quits cheating on you, you might think about it. <br>  Yes you have the right to do that to him, but don't let him jerk you around emotionally. No your not wrong and you are NOT over reacting.<br>  Trust me do it now b4 your 5 years down the road and he leaves you with nothing.|`|28522d76fdc2bf2d2e1ebcafa38469dcaa	Under no circumstances should you even *consider* taking this guy back unless and until he breaks it off with this other girl, moves out on his own somewhere (not with you), and proves that he is truly and genuinely wanting a relationship with you (and you alone).  He's treating you like a fall-back girl.  It's not working out with this other girl but he doesn't want to leave her without having a soft place to fall.  So, he's really using you.  AND he's treating the other gal like dirt, too!  (I'll bet she has no idea he's approached you again.)  It really speaks to his low character to act the way he has towards the both of you (not to mention your son!).  <br>  <br>  Make it clear to him that you aren't even willing to entertain the idea of rekindling a relationship with him until he has moved out of that gal's house, lived on his own for a while and earned back your trust.  THEN you begin considering getting back together.  Your son shouldn't be put through the yo-yo routine with a wishy-washy man unless the guy can prove himself trustworthy and deserving of your respect and time.  And PLEASE, if you *do* get to the place where you think you may want to re-enter negotiations with him, do yourselves a favor and get couple's counseling.  The reasons that split you two apart have not disappeared simply because he's been out of your home for some months.  They still exist and they need to be dealt with (preferably with a professional who can facilitate discussion) before you guys can move on and have a chance at success.  <br>  <br>  I wish you all the best.|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	Seems like he is getting the best of both worlds give him that option, i would say that if he doesnt do that then he must bugger off. I mean he left you in the 1st place for another woman so really your option is nothing bad at all. But leave him if he doesnt and dont bother with trying to get back with him.|`|xue72D76aa	Personally I think you are being overly generous in your behavior.  If I were you and he cheated on me and moved in with another woman when I was pregnant with his baby, it would be over.  He could see his child but there would be NO relationship between he and I.  <br>  <br>  If you do want a relationship with him, then I say you're in your rights to give him an ultimatum.
OTFZtGCaaa	Gosh, I know how you feel!  I’m very sorry to hear that the new girlfriend doesn’t like your children.  This would put any mom on edge.  I hope your ex/his father will not give in and will keep having frequent contact with hopefully both of your children, but at least your son as he’s both of yours.  Partners come and go, but our children will always be our children – I hope he remembers that.<br>  <br>  You’re not overreacting, it’s normal to worry like crazy in a situation like this.  However, if he wants to have contact, which would be nice, you will have to adjust your thinking in terms of “my” child … as it is “your” (meaning, both of yours) child.  Sad reality is that when he has the children (or at least your son), he doesn’t have to tell you anything.  However, it makes life easier if parents get along or at least are civilized.<br>  <br>  I know it’s hard to communicate when there are major issues … and for the non-involved it’s easy to suggest to ‘keep it constructive’.  Just remember that you both have a long road ahead of you.  There are ‘how to’ resources even for the worst situations/communicators.<br>  <br>  Kate P's response how to handle the situation is great advise.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	you are not over reacting, well perhaps slightly, but I don't know the guy, your instincts could be dead on. He is making this a power struggle. He wants to have control. Do not let him have it. Forgo these visits for a while IMO, unless they are inforced by the courts.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	don't let him take your kids again. this is just nonsense - 'dont worry about your kids, go back to work'  - once you get them back, tell him to f-off|`|pvH3oHRfaa	No I don't think you are overreacting, it's a mothers prerogative to worry.<br>  <br>  I do think though, that as your relationship is already strained with your ex-boyfriend, I doubt that he will respond to you if you are angry towards him. <br>  <br>  I think that when you go to pick them up, you should ask calmly if everything was ok. Then a little later, or the next day, you should call him and explain that you need to know whats happening with your kids when he takes them, as you worry, and you need piece of mind. If he thinks you don't trust him, or that you think he's doing a bad job, he's going to be on the defensive, and be passive or angry towards you.<br>  <br>  Hopefully he will understand that he needs to keep you updated, and you can start trusting that he's doing a good job.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard not to worry, but they're his children too, and i'm sure he only wants the best for them.<br>  <br>  I think the important thing to do is to face the problem at a later date when you can discuss it calmly, and not upset your relationship further.
slILtaEiaa	First of all, take a deep breath! Second of all, according to the CDC, antibiotics can be given after birth, in the event that your child is born too quickly. The reason they give you 2 courses of it, is because GBS can re-colonize very quickly. The chance of giving it to your baby is 1 in 200, if you do NOT receive any antibiotics during labor. If you do get antibiotics during labor, it is 1 in 4000. I'll also include a site that summarizes the CDC's recommendations to look out for if you suspect your child could be at risk for GBS infection.
H0fXySX9aa	hun my heart goes out to you what a decision your facing<br>  my friend has 3 children 2 severely disabled after birth and a child with ADhd and autism,<br>  she is 7 weeks pregnant and facing the same choice<br>  the way she has decided is no matter what life throws at you its possible to cope <br>  only you can make that decision but god bless you|`|Bg6txvxqaa	I am so sorry to hear about this. As it was through no real fault of your own and you say that you would suffer immensly if you had to terminate, I personally would go through with the pregnancy, though it will be hard work emotionally and physically with your son the way he is.<br>  <br>  At the moment, I am pregnant with twins and due to being raped 3 years ago I had an abortion, but I found out Wednesday that I am O negative and so should have received the Anti-D injection which I did not get offered and as I did not know my blood group at the time I didn't ask for it. This may be affecting my pregnancy now which could cause still birth or brain damage or just jaundice. So, I have some idea of what you must have gone through as I'm currently going through it now and have to wait until 28 weeks.<br>  <br>  I would keep the baby no matter how hard it was, which is why I kept these as my partner and I didn't plan this pregnancy and weren't ready for children, but after the abortion before, which I have never gotten over, I could never think of doing that again.<br>  <br>  All the best hun, it is ultimately your decision and I don't believe that anybody should judge you for whatever you decide.|`|IfyjeV4Raa	Your baby is very much alive and growing at 12 weeks and I think that you would never be able to handle killing your child. I knwo that having a special needs child is extremely challenging but maybe you could look forward to having a healthy child. You could think of adoption but as someone else mentioned it would be nice to give your oldest child a siblings that they could play with, learn with, more like a "normal" child. I think it would be nice for the disabled child to have siblings to play with and have a lot of family support. I suggest that you see a counsellor. You are grieving that your child is disabled and untill you sort out those feeling you might not be able to bold with the child you are carrying. I send out my heart to you and I myself have a child who was born pregmaturely. He isn't mentaly disabled but he deffinately has special needs. I too became depressed after the birth of my son as the pregnancy was very hard. I struggled with it greatly and I have found healing with therapy. You need to also ignore the ignorant comments that some have left saying that you should've used bc as you clearly stated that you were and the others assuming that you arn't married as if that matters one tiny little bit. don't let them drag you down. If you would like to talk send me an email<br>  :) Meg|`|7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	Don't  kill your baby.  That is not the solution. Give it up.  But let it live.  You will find the strength to get thru the pregnancy....just do right by the child.|`|1pzMFpTpaa	I feel for you. I have never been in your position before though I know what it's like to have very close babies and to lose babies. <br>  I was shocked and upset to find I was preg with my 5th child and was not very happy about it at all... until I thought I was about to loose the pregnancy... then I suddenly and unexpectedly realised I was already very attached to the little one even at 5 weeks of pregnancy.<br>  A few years ago a family member was deciding weather to try for another baby or call it quits at age 38, I told her... Imagine if your Dr told you today that you can never have another child- how do you feel? She was horrified at the thought so she decided not to close up shop just yet.<br>  I think that might be a way you could get close to your real feelings on this matter. It may not help but it could be worth a try.<br>  Sit quietly and try  to really imagine that your pregnancy has ended at 12 weeks and see if you are feeling sad, angry, guilty, relieved or whatever. <br>  It can be tough to raise children close together and even tougher if there are disabilities involved. Remember that if you are feeling stressed, depressed or simply snowed under, you could be seeing this pregnancy as a bigger hurdle than it really is. (not trying to trivialise it at all here though) Also your son may not always be this dependant on you and you may wish to have another child in the future.<br>  This decision could effect you one way or another for a long time.<br>  A termination at 12 weeks is quite a bit more involved than at 6-8 weeks and is usually only done at city or large regional hospitals. Either way, I feel that you need to under go counselling and also talk to someone about a more reliable form of contraception for the future.<br>  You do not have much time to decide. This decision is ultimately up to you and your hubby so I wish you all the love, health and good luck in the world. I Hope come to a decision you are ok with. Good luck.|`|6XR6ajTraa	That's a real difficult one. I would give the baby a chance, your pregnant for a reason, get the dr to do regular unltrasounds to check on your baby's health. Please don't abort, it is horrible what they do to them. You have a chance to bring a healthy baby into this world and your arms. I understand you not wanting to have more hearache, but you don't know if that is going to happen again. I guess that's what you really want to know. Just think about it more do some research on abortion and see if you can live with that or not, some can and some can't. aboritontv.com shows you a video of what really happens if your wanting to know what happens in a termination. Good luck with your dicision.|`|iCvG9kHqaa	Wow this is a tough one, i'm sorry to hear of all your troubles hun. There is always the option of abortion out there, that way the baby still has a chance of survival. In the end the ultimate decision is up to you and your partner, but I thought i'd try and help a little by reminding you of the option. Good luck with every thing xx|`|GfG6wupTaa	You really do not need another baby. And you are not married either? Get on some kind of birth control!!!! I.U.C. is a good idea.|`|1JGj56TFaa	Wow . . . that is so sad.  All i can say is dont abort your unborn child. I think it is a decision you will regret all your life however you will never regret having a beautiful baby.  I have two beautiful children however, getting pregnant was not easy at all.  It took a long time for me to become pregnant and for so long my husband and I thought we may never have children.  These were our darkest days.  Children are a gift from God and so many women desperately want to be mothers and cant have children.  Think of all the joy, happiness and love a new baby will bring into your life.  Your family and friends have no right to be annoyed at you.  Its not their life . . . if they are true to you, they will understand.  Its a tough decision that only you can make.  People can and will give their opinions but you do what is right for you.  I hope and pray you make the right decision and i hope your son continues to thrive.  Good luck x|`|7plkPUI3aa	Your hubby is right hun, you need to focus on your son AND yourself! I've had an abortion myself, and it's hard, I know but you can't risk your sons health and your own mental stability.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, can you live with that choice? It's so hard. Whatever you do, no one close to you will judge I believe that if they understand the situation, they will support you either way.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with everything!|`|83zER2GVaa	This is a really difficult time for you and it sounds like you haven't grieved properly for your stillborn daughter, or your prem son and his problems. I think you should continue the pregnancy as terminating it will add to your grief. However, in the meantime you really need to go to counselling and come to terms with your sad losses of the past. Furthermore, talk to your partner about how you feel and maybe take him to counselling with you. You both need to come to terms with what has happened. Your family will rally round to help you, just don't be afraid to ask for help, not only from family but from professional agencies as well.I detect that you can not terminate the pregnancy, as you say you could possibly find the strength to go through another preg and birth. Go with your heart. The head ill tell you you will struggle, the heart will tell you you will cope somehow. You have gone through so much already, you are a strong woman. Good luck and take care. x|`|BWUlksmmaa	You are in a terrible situation and I really feel for you - either choice you make will be hard but whatever you decide to do, be comforted knowing it was your choice and it was the right choice.  I think you need to speak to someone who can really help you - perhaps your doctor or they could refer you to someone...there are all sorts of places out there offering support to people with similar situations.  Seek help...and whatever you decide to do, make sure you have someone around you who can listen to you and offer support because either way you will have your down moments and thats when you will need someone.  Perhaps try joining a support group for mothers or something similar where you can speak often to people who have gone through what you have been through / will go through.  Do a google search in your area and speak to your doctor as they will be able to point you in the right direction.  Best of luck...|`|kvvlkSQ1aa	This must be a tough decision for you. If deep down you feel you could not cope and it wouldn't be fair on your child then it's an option. If you think that would would suffer with guilt too much and it would affect your mental health and, therefore, your child's care, then perhaps it isn't an option.<br>  <br>  No-one can tell you either way. I know you want someone to categorically say yes or no but they can't. Think about the answers you may get from here. If someone says that you should abort, would that make you angry? Relieved? How about if they said you shouldn't? <br>  <br>  See a doctor. Ask for some counselling. You are not expected to make these decisions on your own. No-one can rightfully judge you for what you're feeling or any decision you may make.|`|ytGaDM7Haa	I'm sorry your child isn't healthy and needs a lot of extra love and attention, but of course you should give your next child a chance to live. This baby is as much your responsibility as the others you have and deserves just as much love as the others. Sometimes having another child after a special needs child can help your family feel more normal, not less. Your oldest will have a confidant and it can take your mind off some the worrying caused by the other child. It is in God's hands whether you are meant to have this child or not, so please just give fate a chance to work herself out.|`|DY6WDiOvaa	honey i know it may be hard as for my mother and a child who died after birth but she had courage and had me  just have this child and love it to bits cause even if it has some sort of disibility u will thank your self for not having a abortion.sweety trust me.|`|F7knBX1haa	First, you seem to have a lot of stressors at this point. I never believe abortion is right. Have you thought about adoption? Even if this child comes early (like your son) then who adopts the child will love him/her as much as you love your son. Maybe you are not ready for another child, but adoption is an option. Think about it.|`|wdhA9wnsaa	Think of your baby as God's gift to you. I went for a scan when I was 14 weeks pregnant and I saw my baby's little heart beating, and then he moved his body, like a little jump. Maybe you do know what to do. You really don't want to terminate this baby, so don't abort it. It would be nice if family could help you, so you can get a lot of rest this time around. You may need to be on bed rest... but you can do it. Be strong!<br>  I know your fear, I had one still birth and a premature baby who didn't make it, and after that I have an amazingly beautiful daughter, I would not trade for the world. Think of how happy you'll be knowing you saved the baby's life. Take care and be strong!
pkdDEJd4aa	NOT pregnant, sounds like normal cycles to me with no fertilized egg in the mix.  BY the way, are you lamb's laughter or lamb slaughterer??|`|Dhsyroekaa	most likely none but anytime you put it in without any protection then there are chances. But since its bee na few months and shes had regular periods you should be fine, Take a test if your worried|`|htSZsds7aa	chances are no she isnt pregnant, BUT 1/3 of women get thier periods all thru pregnancy.  Next time dont have sex until married.|`|b5lzqQEBaa	chances are no... But on the other hand there is people that bleed whenn they are pregnant. People say its not really a period , but thts wht i would call it, With both my kids i bleed like a normal peroid for the first four months. But im guess shes not pregnant. To put ur mind at ease take a test lol|`|AtJgXB59aa	shes not pregnant you mite jus be nervous next time protect yourself|`|Lx5vYz9jaa	yah she's not preggo|`|iLZfMaC4aa	The chances are not none but very unlikely if she has had 3 periods. Always use protection!|`|CuCrGDuRaa	The odds are very slim, but have her take a pregnancy test so you know for sure and then never have unprotected sex again until you want a baby.|`|PQxXh4Q7aa	You really need some sex ed!  You are obviously too young to be having SEX!  Just tell your parents what you have done and they will explain to you the responsibility that comes along with being sexually active.
1z3C0R2Vaa	Not period but vaginal bleed and the thing you cough up please see your doc and i hope is nothing serious my prayers are with you.|`|xzh8r0jIaa	its not very common, you not supposed to bleed when your pregnant, besides when you have implantation bleeding, spotting around the same time you are now, 5 weeks, last about a week of spotting brownish in color    about the coughing up blood, when your pregnant your mucas increases and your blood volume increases...like i had a stuffy nose the whole time i was pregnant, and often bloody ones, i actually had a couple of nose bleeds when i was pregnant, i never get nose bleeds- but it was from being pregnant|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	1 the thing you coughed up has nothing to do with pregnancy but you should get it checked out.    2- if your period is completely normal, your probably not pregnant. Some women do get periods but they are usually mor elike spotting than a period and arent that common.     3- sometime when you are pregnant, you will feel like your period is going to start only it never does.     take a test and find out for sure.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	NO! No bloody stuff out your mouth while pregnant. You need to go to the Dr. It's not that common to have your period while pregnant. If in doubt, get a blood test. If you go in and tell your Dr. your on your period though... he might not give you one.

79eRDIbXaa	Everyone is different - some women have more symptoms then others.<br>  Or some people symtpons take longer to kick in. I started getting my sickness at week 6. Good Luck and Congrats xx|`|1pzMFpTpaa	The pregnancy hormone HGC doubles every few days during very early pregnancy and reaches levels high enough to cause clear symptoms at about 5-6 weeks (counting from 1st day of last period). <br>  If you missed your period which was due to start a week  ago, you may not start feeling symptoms for another week yet, if at all. <br>  I had 9 pregnancies resulting in 5 children and never really got symptoms until 6 weeks with any of them. <br>  Some women seem to "know" they are pregnant right from conception while others never get symptoms at all and still deliver healthy babies. Every woman is different and there is a very wide range of normal. <br>  A pregnancy test should show an accurate result by now. You should test when you first wake up as the HCG concentration is higher then. <br>  Hope this helps and good luck.|`|yCzQVu5Baa	Hi There, I am about the same, havent had a period since Jan 13th.

c56d3e81605e0594bdbef8c5e2e5d37baa	I understand where you are coming from...it is like the whole cry it out method. Each parent is different. We all survived cold medicine, lead based paint and riding in cars without seatbelts. Do what you and your doctor are comfortable with.     One thing that has worked for us, and no joke it works, is putting Vicks on the bottom of my daughter's feet and then putting socks on her before bed. It has something to do with reflexology and stuff...I don't pretend to understand why it works, but I know it has helped Hannah every time she has been congested. Also try propping up the bed or crib. If you keep their heads slightly elevated, it wont pool in their heads and chest.|`|DPegPYRPaa	Vicks should be fine, but talk to your doctor and ask him if your child is too young for the Vicks (I think it is Vicks) Bath stuff. You run a bath and pour this stuff in there and bathe them in it. It really helps with congestion. Also, if it seems to get really bad, ask your doctor about a nebulizer. You can let it blow the medicine into their face while they breathe and it can also clear up congestion.     I don't think that she meant any of the parents on here giving helpful advice, I am guessing somebody came on here being rude and the answer was deleted by yahoo and that is why you don't see it.|`|MaJR6Zlraa	Yes, we have been doing cough/cold medicine for years- I'm sure as a child your mother gave it to you.  But, thankfully, we have progessed and medical evidence shows that this route should be avoided.    You have received some good advice-   1) Ask you doctor  2) Vicks   I personally have always had more results with vicks, for my children and for me.    There are really good reasons to NOT do the cough/cold medicine thing with your child- I urge you to research and certainly ask for a professional medical advice.|`|HvoOeTVuaa	My son has always been a very big boy.  At 9 months old he was wearing size 18 month clothes.  At 9 months old, he weighed 25 pounds.  Because of his size, I had no problem giving him medicine.    I would buy the Triaminic Strips and give him half a strip of the daytime formula in the morning and half a strip of the nighttime formula before bed.  When that didn't seem like enough, I gave him a whole strip.  It worked wonders for him.  I also used Vicks Baby Rub and a cool mist humidifier.    Recently, I have stopped buying the strips because, while they are VERY convenient, it is cheaper to buy the liquid and my son drinks with with no problems.|`|s1zitZMOaa	The reason over the counter cold medicine is frowned upon is for two reasons -   1. *Some* people don't read the instructions and over medicate.   2. This is a key one - They really don't work (which may be why people over medicate).     Go ahead and report me if you'd like, but honestly the best advice I can give (this is what I always did) is to use Vick's Baby Rub, get a humidifier going in the room your child is sleeping in (will help way more than any medicine you can buy), and then turn on the shower very, very hot and close the bathroom door. Once the bathroom fills up with steam go sit in the bathroom with your little one for about 5 or 10 minutes. Basically when you feel like you don't want to sit in there any longer you've been in there long enough. The combo of the Vicks and the steam will help a lot. If you do this right before bed he/she should clear up well enough to get some good sleep. Especially with the humidifier going in the room all night long.|`|ZusC87WBaa	I would only recommend something like Vick's chest rub for the congestion.  Since you already know that all of the other meds are not recommended, I'll just leave it at that.|`|dxTwHB1yaa	I'm not going to say to try this on your own, as it's best to call the doctor for advice...    BUT - my sons doctor suggested that I give him 1/2 to 3/4 of a teaspoon of either Dimatapp or Triamenic cold and cough.     If it doesn't seem to be effective, give another 1/4 teaspoon two hours later.|`|AA12344593	How about Vicks vaporub on the baby's chest and under the nose or you could get a vaporizer with the stuff that you pour into it. But that should loosen the phlegm. Also water would be good for the baby to drink to loosen phlegm. You could also lie the baby face down on your lap with a warm towel on his/her back and just pat the top of the back and that will also get phlegm up. You could also take the baby in the bathroom and turn on the shower really really hot and make it like a sauna and just pat the baby's back; that would also break up the mucus. Just keep wiping the baby's nose with soft kleenex and use that sucker to keep the nose clear. I wouldn't give him/her anything else. That should all be enough to calm the baby down. Good luck!|`|Jmd2N5qLaa	I can't believe you are threatening to report people who offer you common sense.  I have to agree with the answerer above me.|`|5dca67bd0dd4aa9a8ea84176747ecb36aa	It doesn't matter if they are "big babies" they are still babies and their livers are not developed enough to deal with foreign chemicals like this just yet.       I'll take that reporting now.
jLNwrVZRaa	It is possible that you are.  It is to soon to test.  They usually can be done about 5 days before the day you should start your period again.|`|htSZsds7aa	Yes possibly, but boobs wouldnt feel bigger so soon....its probably PMS.
BOXrOvhcaa	Try to use this ovulation calendar tool.   http://www.softorbits.com/awc/   to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation|`|RPszYGXkaa	Yes, you may have ovulated and missed it.  Sometimes we only have a 10 hr window with our LH surge, so if you only test once a day you could miss it.  It also could be that you are ovulating later than you thougt.  I test daily starting at CD10, but once I hit day 12 - 13, I test multiple times a day (2 -3) until I get my positive.  I buy the tests online and they are really cheap, so I can test to my hearts content.    Also try charting your cervical fluid and BBT, it helps to pinpoint ovulation.  Feritlityfriend.com is a great site to use to track it, they will interpret the data for you.  Baby dust!|`|4kX61Y97aa	if you get strong ph ovulation sticks they show. your hormones might be low and thats why they arnt showwing ovulation is around 10-16 days into your cycle|`|aJTBF7opaa	From my experience, i started taking the ovulation tests the first very small chance of ovulation all the way to the very last possible day, and never received a positive, but i became pregnant. I am confident that the strips were not defective, not sure what happened. But yes i feel it is possible.|`|yznZqcznaa	No you get your surge a day before you ovulate so you should get a positive before you ovulate.  Usually the positive will last a day or even two.|`|0BC2WTyoaa	Yes it is possible to only get negatives but still ovulate.  I chart everything and so I know I ovulate but I didn't get positive OPK some months and other months my surge came in the middle of the night.  I started testing several times a day in order to get a positive.|`|z5kEznU3aa	yes ! For some women ovulation tests doesn't work, I don't know why...maybe you ovulated just for few hours ( I heard, that is possible ). Did you drink less and didn't go to the bathroom for few hours? I tried ovulation test and they becomke positive for one day- one day before I ovulated. Good luck. Oh, and some woman ovulate later...closer to period, so it's really possible, that you still can get positive result later. My friend ovulated always on day 21 ( 28 days period cycle )|`|ZfIWaO0Taa	Glad you asked this I have been using these and not had 1 positive at all from day 9 through to day 22...my cycles are 26 day average after m/c in August!! I just got a load more and am going to start testing from day5 this month right through and see what happens! So 5 days from now I will start all over again. Good luck to you.  J.x
1hciyvKdaa	Maybe start taking the child on walks, to the park, so that the child can grow and deal with others dealing with thier crying, that must be so unfun for you. I would kindly tell her you feel like a sibling and not a sitter since she comes in to do your job so much, say it jokingly, somehow.|`|KmC0K59taa	The baby would do better if the mom wasn't popping in and leaving again every 15 mins.  She has to realize she's not helping the situation.<br>  <br>  Are you new at this job?  Maybe she will go longer without popping in once she begins to trust you more.  But really there is probably nothing you can do unless you bring it up to her.  And she might get snarky with you.|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	Mothers generally know that one-year-olds do have trouble being away from their mother.  They get to that age and figure out that they aren't "one person with their mother".  If she leaves the room they're too young to be able to understand the concept that she isn't gone forever.  That mother is probably trying to keep her baby's (and he is a baby) anxiety to a minimum.<br>  <br>  Children learn to be independent, and they tend to quite naturally want to exercise that independence the minute they are old enough to know they have even a little bit of it (which is around two years old).  As they grow, the quite naturally try to become more and more independent.<br>  <br>  At one year old a baby is not at a stage for "learning independence".<br>  <br>  It may be inconvenient and a pain-in-the-neck for you, but it is never bad for a baby to see his own mother.  She probably doesn't care if he learns that you can (or could) eventually calm him down.  She's working from home, and has hired you, so she can still keep something of an eye on him, while still being able to take her eyes off him some of the time as well.   I think you should just play with him, do whatever it is she has said she's paying you to do, and don't worry about whether she keeps popping back.|`|Mbgck2ifaa	It's a mothers instinct to run to her child when he cries, it's hardwired into our brains. I do the same thing sometimes, my reason is because i feel like she is my responsibility and i just feel guilty when i let other people do my job for me, it makes me feel like a bad parent. I know, i felt like i should leave, but you just feel guilty leaving someone with a wimpering child. What you can do when she runs in like that is talk to the little boy, rather than to her, say something like "Come on, lets go color (or play blocks or whatever) so mommy can get her work done" My babysitter used to do that and it was a huge relief! That way she won't feel compelled to do everything, and you can distract the baby so she can slip out. If you do that and she insists on staying then you should politely resign and tell her that you loved the job, but you didn't feel that she needed you around because she does everything anyways. She will either agree with you or agree to stop trying to do everything. It's a process, cut her some slack, she's fighting her maternal instinct.<br>  <br>  maybe u can help me with my question!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220011754AA6KxjC">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	Mother's instinct I guess, either that or she doesn't trust you (nothing personal she may be like that with any helper).  Frankly I don't get why she's hired you then!  She may as well mind the kid on her own.  I guess you can only leave & tell her why if you feel like it (in a diplomatic way of course, especially if you want a reference....).
3Rr5SAhhaa	it is possible but  you wouldnt get pregnant the day before you get your period, and even if you were pregnant it would be too soon to be feeling symptoms. its probably a stomach flu or something.|`|4U7327Mzaa	Some women have one last period after they get pregnant.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Hun technically you can ovulate at any time of the month.  You can also get pregnant while you are on your period.  This is not the norm but it is a possibility.  Take a test in two weeks to make sure.  Good luck hun|`|jLNwrVZRaa	It is possible to have a period and be pregnant.
ZusC87WBaa	You won't need a referral for an obgyn, so my advice would be to go that route right from the start.  It wouldn't hurt to find yourself a primary care physician too...in case you get sick with something not related to your pregnancy.  You don't have to look for a pediatrician this early, but make sure you start really looking into it when you hit about 7 months.  Good luck and congratulations!|`|egN478Bbaa	Contact the insurance to see if you need to get the PCP to send u to an OBGYN.  Insurances are all different.  U can wait on the pediatrician.  Ask your OBGYN for suggestions on those.  I am sure they know lots of them.  have fun w/  everything and remember, if nething bothers u when ur prg, GO TO THE DR!  Dont wait!|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	First i must say congrats....you can go to your OBGYN and he will take it from there.And start take your vitamin Good luck to you and happy happy nine months.|`|qW6xdklnaa	I was pregnant once and I liked it but my mom made me give it up to a rich family in town (via an independent adoption). I got a college tuition out of it and a lot of money, but always hated her for making that choice. I can't wait to get preg again. I liked getting preg too! :D I'm only 17 but am trying. I want to go on welfare, work part-time and have my baby. It will serve my mom right too. Anyway, good luck.. I started getting nausea early on. It was pretty bad, almost all day, but it was worth it. I loved being pregnant!|`|W492U39Iaa	You can go straight to an OBGYN.  You don't need to choose a pediatrician yet, either.  You can do that on your third trimester which will give you plenty of time to find the one that's right for you and your baby.|`|4U7327Mzaa	Many insurance carriers will allow a woman to use her ObGyn as her Primary Care Physician.   You can usually wait until closer to the due date to pick out your pediatrician.|`|zSABr7praa	CONGRATS!  You may need to see your doctor first to get an OBGYN referral, depending on your insurance.  Look up OBGYNs in your area, call them to make an appointment.  They'll ask about your insurance, and at that point they can usually tell you if you need a referral or not.  Best of luck!      UPDATE: Maybe military insurance is the only one that makes you see your doctor first! I have military insurance, and they required that i see my primary dr first to get a referral, maybe you won't need too!|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Nope you just go right to the OB. Usually you wait to find a pediatrician. We had one before our son was born. We decided in the hospital and then ended up chaining when he was about 4 days old because we didn't like the first one. Call an make your appointment with your OB. Congrats and Good Luck!
qFvHH6lUaa	There's nothing really painful until you go into labor.  Braxton hicks (that's when your uterus a "practicing" contractions) can be uncomfortable.  Your 1st appt., they'll draw blood & probably do an internal exam.  Your gonna have to pee in a cup every time.  They're checking for protien and sugar.  Your blood pressure will be checked.  THe doc will ask how your feeling and any symptoms, messure your belly and eventually start listening for the heart beat.  At about 20wks, you'll have blood drawn again and an U/S.  And really, for a normal pregnancy that's it until you go into labor.  I won't lie.  It's gonna hurt realllll bad.  But just tell your doctor up front that you want an epidural or whatever you choice is ahead of time.  Good luck.|`|zSABr7praa	Well, in your first trimester, your boobs grow and get very tender, you sleep a lot (or WISH you were sleeping a lot), you get hormonal (cranky/emotional), and the thought of certain smells/foods/drinks you once loved make you nauses! The second trimester gets so much better :)  They'll draw blood at your Drs appointment, give you prenatal information, write you a prescription for prenatal vitamins, and make sure your over all health is good.   Pregnancy books and websites (babycenter.com) are very helpful.  Make sure your husband/partner reads up on what to expect too, you will be going through a lot of changes and it's important he understands and knows what to expect.  Best of luck.|`|Dhsyroekaa	every pregnancy is different  My only signs were sore breasts and was very tired. Then missed period.  There isnt another way to have a baby that is yours without pregnancy. Its only the end/labour part that is the worse but when you hold the baby it will all be worth it!|`|htSZsds7aa	If you are married and want to get pregnant great, please wait til then. I never got sick, worked right up to 2 weeks before and labor hurt but its a pain u forget.  Odd I know but you really dont remember the pain.  yes u will need blood work, ultrasound, a dr visit 1x month for about 7 months then a bit more often. Its expensive, so I hope there is insurance.  You usually wont show until the 5th month  and by the end u are uncomfortable but not in pain|`|8WRnqs08aa	With my first pregnancy, I was scared to death because what goes in, must come out & it was1000 x's bigger coming out - OUCH!    I got pregnancy books and read them, and read them and read them - that was 18 years ago & today I still read them.    By the time I delivered my first baby I was no longer scared, but excited and ready for whatever I had to endure in order to meet this little creature growing within.    Educate yourself and refrain from listening to the horrific labor & delivery stories some will tell. It's very painful, but if you educate yourself & learn to relax, you will get through it.    I gave birth to my first 2 children withOUT any medications. My third child I had a little something in my IV, which wore off after 45 minutes and they wouldn't give me anymore - delivered 15 minutes later. My fourth was delivered via c-section as will this next one.    Don't be afraid to ask for something to make you feel more comfortable during labor.    Good Luck!|`|0KsL6Hi5aa	Every pregnancy is different. My first symptom was at 4 weeks, I suddenly could smell EVERYTHING! It has persisted and I am 15 weeks right now. My second symptom was breast tenderness, but More so they would tingle. I never had bad pain, just sore. I was very nauseous from 7 to 14 weeks, but I never got sick. Another symptom ( kinda gross ) is increased discharge. It sometimes feels like you might have peed your pants just a little, not fun :) At about 10 weeks I noticed slight tenderness and pains in my lower abdomen, it is your uterus stretching. I freaked out as this is my first pregnany as well and thought something was wrong, but all is fine.    Your first appt. after they confirm you are pregnant they usually have you talk with a nurse and they take a couple tubes of blood. I have not had any taken since that first appt. The next appt we met with the doctor and he did a full pelvic exam and listened for a heartbeat. Then at 12 weeks they did an ultrasound, but not every doctor does one at this point, most just do one around 20 weeks.    Hope this helps!
6vdttMYpaa	I like them. They are a little quirky. I get what you're saying about being individual, but be careful not to give them a name thats bully-worthy. That would be worse i think.<br>  <br>  The one i like best is Cleopatra. Cleo would make a cute nickname. Along the same theme how about Athena? Thats still quite different but without being too crazy. I have a friend called that spelt Athina. Shes the only one i ever met, and she lives up to here name by being very pretty and lovely!<br>  <br>  Best of luck anyway!|`|wbfBciSuaa	laylas very cute.<br>  <br>  and the others are more suitable for middle names. my cousin's middle name is belle, which is quite cute.|`|M8jEeYoCaa	I love the last three.

You would likely shorten it to Cleo, which is also kind of cool.<br>  <br>  Aphrodite is hard to say (the dite part) and the obvious nickname is Afro but otherwise I like the inspiration for it.<br>  <br>  Tiara seems really common to me, at least it is where I live and it reminds me of a low-class princessy little girl.<br>  <br>  Layla, not crazy about.<br>  <br>  Rafaela sounds exotic and intriguing, I like it.<br>  <br>  Carmella has a similar feeling to it as Rafaela, I like them both.|`|Z6AcG5GNaa	I dislike the name Emma, too. Cleopatra could be called Cleo; Aphrodite would not suit a real person; Tiara sounds faux-riche (if that's a word), but it's not too bad; Layla's becoming increasingly popular, and I'd avoid it if you're going for the unique thing; Rafaela...not feeling it; Carmella is my mom's best friend, so it reminds me of her (or just women in their 40s).<br>  <br>  I like the name Leonie a lot; when I have a daughter, I think I will use it as a middle name.|`|HvX6KvK1aa	lovely. i like tiara best!|`|VHHis05Naa	I like Rafaela and Cleopatra, but she would end up being Cleo which is frequently used on cats.|`|ahsgk6bXaa	Cleopatra is nice, she can shorten it to Cleo, which is nice too.<br>  Tiara is what you wear on your head if you're a princess, so I don't know about that!<br>  Rafaela and Carmella sound very Italian, which is nice if that's your heritage,<br>  Layla....not sure if I like it.

I believe women should have the right to choose, but if you had any common sense or compassion then why wouldn't you choose birth control over an abortion? You can get birth control for free in the US pretty damn easy, so if you just think it's simply more convenient to kill a helpless fetus than to carry a condom with you, then yeah, you're a pretty selfish and immoral person. There's really no way to sugar coat that. I've heard women say, "but my sex partners don't want to use condoms..." as if they are helpless victims who have never heard of the pill or the dozen other forms of birth control available. Besides, what they're really saying is that "I'd rather risk having to kill an innocent fetus than disappoint a man by insisting on a condom." Now, I know some women have low self-esteem, but becoming a serial fetus killer isn't going to help that any, so they may as well deal with that issue in a more constructive way.|`|2x9DzThKaa	I think it's very easy to judge... and I doubt anyone is going to praise someone for having many abortions.

Its not a form of birth control.

723QHuicaa	Parents with a form of mental retardation would have a high level of support anyway.<br>  <br>  Mental health problems should not have a stigma attached that if you have depression, bi-polar, PPD etc - doesnt mean you arent a good parent. Parents without recognised or treated mental health problem are just as likely to harm their kids. Its not fair to target the people who have admitted they were struggling and got help and treatment. That alone shows they are as responisble and capable as the next person|`|Yz2TvEMlaa	I think it's a novel idea, however, CPS doesnt seem to have time to check up on the cases they have already, the case load would be enormous if they added on every parent with a mental health issue or developmental problems.. And that sort of thing kinda worries me in that, i have a history of depression.. have had to be medicated for it before.. nothing extreme and i've never been hospitalized or anything like that, but where would they draw the line? I dont like giving government services so much power. Maybe im paranoid, but i dislike the idea of letting the government decide on who is fit to be a parent based on medical history.

(EPT and First Response are like that)<br>  <br>  if she was already due to have her period and she hasn't then she would def get a true neg or pos at this point.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You can test 14 days after sex. It takes most women that long to get accurate results. If she's a few days late she should test.|`|AA11763588	Anytime after a missed period is a good time to take one.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	The earliest you can get a positive result on the most sensitive pregnancy tests is seven days after ovulation. Implantation needs to occur before hCG is produced, and that generally happens between 6-12 days post ovulation, usually by 10 days after. For this reason, it makes economical sense to wait until 10-12 days after ovulation, but even then a significant percentage of women who are indeed pregnant will still show a negative result. If you have not had an hCG injection (common in fertility treatment, brands include Profasi, Pregnyl and Novarel), you can believe the positive, but you might get a false negative. If your period is late, test again. Your hCG levels should double every 2-3 days and many people won't have a positive HPT until the first day of a missed period or even a few days later.<br>  <br>  I got this from <a href="http://www.fertilityplus.org/faq/hpt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityplus.org/faq/hpt.htm...</a> check it out, it will tell you which test to buy. They are all listed according to the sensitivity of the hcg they can detect.|`|FadwoZW5aa	If it was January 18th then the test should give her an accurate answer.. I took a test exactly a month after my last period and it showed me as pregnant. I took like 8 tests to be sure.. lol but if she is pregnant it should be able to tell now. Could she just be stressing over something that could cause her to be late?|`|wKuQC4yTaa	you can get a false positive! it is very rare. and women who go through menopause can have false positives.|`|nhhCow4haa	you can get false positives, iv had one
1jwbQaZTaa	no i think a doctor will ok it until 30 weeks, even then he will probably say ok if you are still doing well. <br>  <br>  even some ins. companies will advise you not to travel out of the state once you reach 36 weeks, because if you deliver in a different state your benefits may not apply!|`|OHfZFR31aa	At 18 months it should be fine but also check with your doctor.

Just in case you go into labor during the flight!<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to contact the airline you want to fly with, and ask them what their policies are.

Just make sure that you take a copy of your prenatal medical records with you in case you go into labor in a strange city. Depending on the time of day and location, it could be difficult for the staff to get your records from your regular obgyn or midwife. Having your records with you will help them know right away what's going on with you, and if there are any complications they should be aware of. I took a 2 page print-out with me just in case. That's something your obgyn should be able to print up for you really easily at your last visit before traveling if you ask.|`|lhqM4qhxaa	its safe to fly even u r pregnant, when i was pregnant that was 2002, i was working in the middle east, me and my husband decide to deliver our child in my country which is somewhere in asia i had to travel for 9 hours straight, the airline required a medical report regarding my pregnancy(the airline company has the form for u to fill up). and to think that im 7 1/2 months pregnant that time, everything goes smooth but i experience some little water was came out but i believe that is normal.|`|RfGTXlotaa	check with your doctor but i believe that you are able to fly up to 30 weeks... check with the airline if they will take you as well but there should not be any harm to your baby... just talk it over with your doctor before you leave|`|OROeuP0yaa	18 weeks i gues its safe as long as u were healthy during that time and no complication <br>  <br>  good luck

rrtqwO9Waa	My first pregnancy i had a girl and my mum new it was a girl before i had the ultrasound, i threw up until i was 6 months felt like crap everyday for the next 3 months, i'm now 5 months pregnant and i hav'nt had any morning sickness at all i have felt like my normal self (apart from the expanding tummy) and i'm having a boy this time. So i think your definately having a girl.|`|xue72D76aa	Each pregnancy is different so I don't necessarily think you are having a girl based on the fact that your pregnancy is running a different course than your previous one.  <br>  <br>  Also, the way you carry the baby has less to do with the gender than it does your body structure.  Most women tend to carry their first and second children differently because the pelvis is wider the second pregnancy.|`|io0QtYYtaa	they say the way you carry tells you what your having and from the old wives tales i heard you have a classic girl. thats how it was with my sister two, her first was a boy and looked like she was smuggling a pumpkin and her 2nd was a girl and she just looked wide|`|MCWNXCa5aa	well im 23 weeks pregnant and frustrated to know what the gender of my baby is, on my last ultrasound they didnt found out the gender coz the baby legs were not wide open so they coulndt tell what the baby gender is, this is my first baby, i dont feel any symptoms of being pregnant except frequent urinating and sore boobs, i was so fatty all over my body, crave for something sweets, soda and junkfoods...but even i ate sour i dont feel anything its just i'm not comfortable eating sour compare to sweets. and same here i really want a baby girl GOODLUCK TO US!|`|AA11631559	I gave birth to my first child which was a girl. I was all belly had morning sickness that lasted for about 4, 5 months but was nothing terrible or serious. Cravings I wanted sweet and sour chicken quite a lot. Can't give much advice about sweets as I have always had a sweet tooth. It could be a girl but I think every pregnancy is different.<br>  All the best and congratulations|`|8012427537078e29822bf1bd1e533dfaaa	Sorry, but your priorities are way off. It's a baby. It does not matter if it's a boy or girl, just hope that he or she is healthy. See your doctor and take care of yourself, you know you are a good mother to your little boy. Don't sweat the small stuff. Just take care of yourself and your baby, and be glad your not having octuplets :)|`|qGh1HhPwaa	It will be a girl, I know it!|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	My first was a girl. I had a reasonably easy pregnancy except for some backache and nausea. Nothing too major.<br>  With my second, I was very sick, very tired, had awful acid reflux and heartburn, crippling backache, sleeping problems, water retention, food aversions (to most foods), mood swings... etc etc<br>  It was another girl. I was convinced it would be a boy as the pregnancies were so different, but I now have 2 lovely little girls!
1hciyvKdaa	Well you taught her that normal was your bed, so now its going to be work and lots of tears and fears to undo this. First off, get a baby gate, a really strong one, she should not be able to walk around the house alone at all. Your not a bad mom hun, its fun to have our babies in our bed, in our room, I remember that well. Its that the babie learns everyting from us, so once we teach it one way, and now need to adjust it, we need to be able to deal with the outcome, which will be a child crying to go with mom, it wont be easy, leave alot of soft toys around, put away sharp edged toys, the xmas lights are a great idea, pls make sure thier not the ones from stores in generic boxes, this year they all said right on them, lead paint warning, wash hands after use and small particles will fall off them. I mean walmart, target, every growcery store, pharmacy, the ones in generic looking boxes. Anyhow, get her a lil music player and teach her how to turn it on, not electric, and just put in ear plugs. You can get up and take her potty once a night, and you can go into her room and read, but in the end, she needs to now understand this, if this sounds tough, just remember when shes a teen itll be the drugs and boy talks, this is nothing compared to the ills of a teen, belive me:(|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Some of the previous answers really on ly apply to babies, a bright 3 nearly 4 yr old girl such as yours won't hold any truck with them :P <br>  You say you've discussed why she was scared....maybe you could leave nightlights in the hall so she can come to you if needed.<br>  Let her know that if she is scared and wants to come see you that is ok, give her a hug then take her back to her own bed.<br>  Don't let her sleep in your bed, always take her back.<br>  Also don't let her fall asleep in your bed and then carry her back to her bed it will scare her more.   <br>  Try a reward chart, start simple (going to bed in her own bed and going back to her bed after a hug in the night) then gradually up the ante until you are rewarding her form staying all night in her own room.<br>  The key is to not frighten her when she is already nervous by being very cross, but also making sure you stand firm, the rules are no more sleeping in mummys bed, but there are always hugs and mummy is always easily found :)<br>  Good luck :) x.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	well one idea would be, maybe fall asleep in her room with her to show her its not scary. once she drifts off , return to your own bed. <br>  <br>  i hope this helps.. i really didnt have this issue so i dont have many ideas im sorry.|`|PVb3iiaAaa	i put cookies under thier pillow and told them to sniff it!!!!!!! hahaha|`|hieQHR0daa	You, and your daughter do need help. She is too nervous at the moment. First you need to find ways to build her confidence. You need to start creating a distance that she can cope with at night time. Does she settle in her or your bed without you at bedtime? <br>  There are a variety of graded programs you could use to slowly increase her Independence.<br>  The problem with co-sleeping is always changing to putting your child in their own room and own bed. I have worked with families whose children are 7/8/9 years old and they have remained in the parents bed for all these years.<br>  You should talk to your health provider about this and get a full and detailed plan. I cannot offer that to you through this forum. <br>  You will probably be asked for two weeks completed sleep diaries so that the person helping you can see is your daughter has night terrors, nightmares or issues of abandonment. You are not a bad parent and it's not that you are doing anything wrong but you do both need help to sort this out.|`|xJW1RSaAaa	My son is two and sleeps in our room because that IS what is normal! Putting children in other rooms by themselves is not normal not is it natural. It is only social expectation that makes people do this.<br>  <br>  I got a bed and put my son in that in our room, he can come into our bed whenever he likes for a cuddle...<br>  <br>  HERE is a great article on how to get your child to move from your bed  into their own bed<br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/sl20.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/sl20.asp</a><br>  <br>  Well done for breast feeding for a year, but that isn't very long.

Get an exorcist.|`|yCzQVu5Baa	I watched Supernanny the other day, and what you do is put them in their bed and sit next to it not giving them eye contact. When they get out, you put them back in without saying a word, just make sure you maintain the no eye contact. After repeating this a few times, they will go to sleep no worries. Night after night move further and further away from their bed, and eventually they will do it themselves, I tell you what, that woman Jo Frost is magic. Everything she does works everytime.
kaqPSgTVaa	You can't get a positive test a week after ovulation. You have to wait for your missed period. Some test say they can test 5 days sooner, but that's the thing, they "can" they don't work for most women to test that early. <br>  <br>  Your cramping could be from implantation bu it could also be from PMS. Just wait and see.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	it could be the side your egg came from. implantation isnt suppose to be painful|`|S1V47cPUaa	I had alot of that during middle school they took my left ovary out because it was covered with a grapefruit sized cycst. It's called polly cycstic ovaries i'm not saying you have it but it would be a good idea to let the dr know what's going on don't worry you can still have kids i had 3 after that was done|`|RfGTXlotaa	I used to have that when i had endeodemetriosis and poly cycistic overies... have you checked all that out?
ytGaDM7Haa	Emery sounds like an emery board. <br>  Have you seen the episode of The Office where the baby's name is mistaken for being Astird? as in *** turd. that would be a sucky nickname.|`|sy0hiGspaa	I love Astrid, but I don't really like Emery.Maybe Amerie (i think it means work).<br>  <br>  Oh wait- @ss turd! I get it! Okay scratch that.|`|7uy8iy7laa	AH! I LOVE Emery!!!!!!!!!! It's on the top of my list actually. I don't think it's weird at all. It's not outdated either. It's unique, pretty, and sophisticated. Nick-names could be "Em" or "Emi". <3<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope This Helps!!! Good Luck & Best Wishes! <br>  <br>  (Best answer PLEASE!!)|`|e4M4uQXNaa	rofl I was just about to mention the Astird thing because that episode just reran last night lol.<br>  <br>  But still, despite that, I think Astrid is a gorgeous name, and it's the one I'd pick between Astrid and Emery actually.  It's really unlikely people won't know how to pronounce it (like Michael Scott lol) or won't know the correct spelling (it's not that hard of a name, but still unusual and really striking).<br>  <br>  Emery is cute, but sounds much trendier than Astrid does.  Probably because there has been a lot of parents going with Emerson for their baby girls recently (or, even worse, Emmersyn lol).  <br>  <br>  Emery isn't bad though, and I still think it's a pretty name.  I just like Astrid better, even with the Astird thing haha.  Just hope by the time she gets old enough for high school, kids her age won't even remember the Office lol.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Emery is a masculine boy's name, horrid for a little girl. I love Astrid, it is feminine and lovely in the middle name spot.|`|AA10151168	Astrid sounds like a cartoon space character's name lol<br>  <br>  Emery is better.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Emery. Not Astrid, a bit too out there for my liking.|`|mgLNIfiIaa	Uh, I don't see how Emery is outdated - it reached a new high in popularity (though it is still quite rare) last year. Maybe if it were 2089 it might sound outdated, but not in 2009. <br>  <br>  I like them both (but prefer Emery), I think they are really pretty and classy. I wouldn't worry about the assturd thing, I know a girl called Astrid and she's never gotten that or anything other than compliments on her name.|`|HvX6KvK1aa	those names are too out of date
tHEBPDenaa	i like it! it's unique and original but it's not stupid. a lot of times when people try to be unique they just change the name so the spelling is really crazy or they choose a name that no one can pronounce. but ellesmere is a nice name and it's original too!<br>  <br>  Also, I would keep the spelling ellesmere... i don't know why but i hate the look of 'z' instead of 's' in names. ellie is such a cute nickname.... or elle.|`|5c079cb1c9fa7ffe7d3cdc8fa57061a6aa	i saw the name and it reminded me of reneesme of twilight<br>  <br>  hmm....<br>  <br>  definatly unique, but i like the dragon's name better<br>  <br>  your kid's name would be pronounced wrong and she might hate you for naming her<br>  <br>  it kinda rhymes with alzheimer's|`|DNQxUcptaa	My first thought, as an Englishman, is of the port near Liverpool, not a place I would associate with beauty.<br>  <br>  I like the idea of spelling it with a z though, that would make the pronunciation clearer.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	I think it's a gorgeous name - for a fictional character.  For a real live child, I think it's a bit pretentious.  It sounds like the parents were trying a bit too hard to be mystical and exotic.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	It pretty awful - it sounds just what it is, a made up name for a fantasy story.  <br>  <br>  If you're planing on giving your kid this name, well, it's your choice and what we think shouldn't matter.  But I doubt your child would thank you for it.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but you asked.....|`|pZ7B7VFcaa	reminds me of a city in Turkey called Izmir<br>  <br>  i prefer the name Ella or liza over Ellesmere|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I don't like it.

Not a big fan.<br>  But it is truly up to you. <br>  That's all that matters.<br>  I like Ellie as the nickname though.|`|V1TIIiL9aa	thats BEAUTIFUL. i love it. to be honest, when i saw the spelling i was like what kind of a try hard name is this but when i saw the pronounciation its stunning.<br>  <br>  love it, all the best<br>  xxxxx|`|xlzt97tIaa	I prefer Ellie over everything that you listed.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Sounds a bit too much like one of the Elves from Lord of the Rings.|`|UJaCObdyaa	Actually I think it is a beautiful name.<br>  I said it out loud a few times and the more I said it the more I liked it.

xue72D76aa	My advice would be to buy a home pregnancy test and take it with your first urine of the day.  You would be late enough that a positive result would show if you are pregnant.  If you are not pregnant, you could have missed a period due to stress.  I know you said you haven't been stressed but sometimes your body can be stressed without you consciously realizing it.  I have missed 2 periods in my life due to stress and both times I would have sworn up and down that I wasn't stressed at all.  Good luck!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You need to take a test. We can't tell you if you are pregnant. Take a test.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	when your around other girls periods do shift together. i screwed my friends all up because i was regulating mine with birthcontrol and hers changed to when i had mine. if your friend has had hers, then you have a high possibility of pregnancy. since she missed hers, you can safely assume yours is late. i would go buy a pregnancy test. good luck hun
AA11763588	The only way to know and to ease your mind is to take a test.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take a test.|`|6HS1ot35aa	If you missed in January, but had your period in February and are late this month, I'm pretty positive you aren't pregnant. You most likely are just irregular. There was a point where I didn't get my period for like 3 months and I knew it was impossible for me to be pregnant cause I'm a virgin, but I asked my doctor and she said that it was because I'm physically active (I'm a runner). So, if you play sports, or recently started working out, that is possibly the case..or if you have changed your diet (lost or gained wait recently) that could be the case as well. But, if it's just killing you, then I say you take a pregnancy test. Hope this helps! :)|`|iiMQhey6aa	Its most likely that you are not pregnant since your period came in Feb. but on the safe side, still take the pregnancy test.<br>  Sometimes we miss our periods or they come late<br>  it could be due to stress and other factors<br>  so dont panic yet.<br>  anyways have protected sex or dont have sex if you are worried about the aftermath !|`|c32aCqwqaa	get a test my girlfriend thought she was pregnant, because she was suuuper late on her period, go to wallmart or something cause they are like 5 bucks and test yourself... also if you are just getting off birth control that can mes with things a bit|`|XBTF1XvZaa	The best thing to do is go and have a pregnancy test for you to clear your doubt.|`|ePEQcIz3aa	You don't ovulate until a few weeks after your period.

AA12344593	I wouldn't think so but then again when it comes to your period, almost anything can knock it off balance. It would be like a new phase of your life so anything really is possible. I don't remember any major changes or anything when I quit. I think mainly hormones though in reality is what changes your cycle up. Just try to remain calm as easy as it sounds and just go with it.|`|x7WphuY5aa	i just quit to and then decided to try for number two and i haven't noticed anything but i do fell healthier i smoked for 7 yrs and i just went to my dr and he told me my lungs sound great and my heart to my blood pressure is out standing  so i don't just think i fell better my body is doing a lot better
xue72D76aa	I would sit her down and talk to her.  She may not realize she's being overbearing, she may just feel like she's helping.  Each of us has probably gone through this (to some extent) with our mothers when we had our children.  My mom had to be informed that times have changed and there are things we do (or don't do) today that used to be advised in the past.  She took it all in stride and is great with my daughter.  If you talk to her and maintain open communication, you should solve the problem.  If she continues past this talk, then there is something else at the root of her behavior.|`|G2auAv1Saa	This is pretty normal. Your mom feels like you don't know what you are doing because you are new at it and she feels attached to the baby and doesn't want anything to happen to him.   I would tell her something like she was a wonderful mom and you learned so much from her, and you still have things to learn but some are best by trial and error. Ensure her you will seek her advice when you need it and when it is something very important and that new moms just have to wing it sometimes.   Do you live together?|`|Qm4BKE13aa	Tell her it's your baby. Explain that if you need help you will ask for it and she is more than welcome to give you advice but you would like to do things for your child and take care of him. Remember though that she is just trying to help but if you need it you will ask. Congrats and good luck!|`|4WNeBRjVaa	If you dont live with her, than she really has no say. It's so hard to stand up to our Mom's but that's exactly what you need to do! I dont undersatnd why she thinks she can control your children? You need to put your foot down. She cares about them, so she should understand where your coming from.    Good luck|`|UtxHDm3vaa	well do you still live with her? if so go along with how shes acting like nothing is wrong while you save up for an apartment or house. in the meantime... show her that you are very responsable by taking care of him how she does.                     OR  if you dont live with her then tell her that he is your son and if she could lay off that would be great.|`|33fa67ba937f7dc93091ebd71003e511aa	This did happen to me when I had my son a few years ago. My mom treated me like a child and talked to me like I did not know what I was doing. And I lived with her so there was not much that I could do. But one day I set her down and had a long conversation with her and told her what a good mother she was to me and how that rubbed off on me. And that I had to learn how to be a mother that I would become a good mother. And after I set her down and showed her that I was and still am a good mommy she has laid off very much. She now treats me like a grown woman with a baby. So I hope this helps ya! Good luck on the baby.

They make you take a pregnancy test at the Dr or in their office so they do get proof.    Faking it to a man will not get you arrested but that is very childish and wrong.

For example: if one fakes a pregnancy to extort money or goods from someone, or if it involves frauding our welfare systems, then yes, you can be arrested!  Be smart...|`|852b64707eee9567246c31b995f4a087aa	If the purpose of faking the pregnancy was to enrich yourself through marriage, or by getting gifts and money, it is possible that someone who was disturbed by that kind of callous misrepresentation could indeed sue you for the money that was paid out or in the case of a marriage based on the fakery, an annulment and possible small claims court action might occur.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	This likely depends on the level of your deception. Take it to the level of financial gain and you could be charged with fraud.|`|hlztyMYyaa	uh no you cant not unless insurance fraud is in the mix|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	no, unless its involved in some other case in court than maybe you could be arrested for purgery, or lying under oath. faking a pregnancy is just stupid, insensitive and down right psycho!|`|SRIaRm08aa	Only if it were to get something out of it (ex.money, insurance, personal gain, money from an ex etc.). People can sue you for it if you got something out of them by faking a pregnancy.  Why would you want to do that anyway. It is irresponsible and humiliating.  Plus, eventually people will find out that you really are not pregnant. And then what?  Are you going to fake a miscarriage too?  Please don't. That is just like a slap in the face to all the women whom have had miscarriages. It is a serious matter and not a joke.  You can hurt your friends and family.  Messing with someones emotions is no joke.|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	on harassment charges maybe. depends on what youVe done to this person before telling them you were pregnant.    stupid move to do this..... once you cry wolfe falsely.. no one will ever beleive you or even be excited if you do fall pregnant.
qFvHH6lUaa	I have been on the mag drip three times.  I know that it really sucks to be on it, I usually cry when they tell me that I need it.  I know that it can depress the baby a little, but if the doctor says you need it, you should take it.  I had severe preeclampsia.  Is that what you have?  I know that you don't want it, but trust me from my own experience the mag sulfate has been what's kept me from having a stroke or a seizure, both of which are way worse for the baby than the medicine.  I guess you could refuse it, but really, I wouldn't.      I just read your edit and I wanted to tell you that my last baby was born by emergeny c-section at 35 wks after I'd been on the drip for 2 days.  She spent 1 day in the NICU for observation.  Never needed any help breathing or eating and was able to go home before me.  Have you had steroid shots yet?    Just read your second edit and mag feels pretty bad.  You'll get crazy hot and disoriented.  I truly hate it, but it's more important to be on it to get the baby here safe than to worry about what crap you'll feel like.  Trust me.    Then they want you to take the mag to keep from going into labor.  Mag is like a muscle relaxer, that's why it depresses you and the baby.  If they're concerned about pre-term labor and are trying to get u some more time, take it.  They say that one day in the womb is worth 2 days out.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	You are the patient.  And it's your body.  You can do whatever you feel is needed.  Don't forget that!|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	You do have the right to refuse any medication but it's beneficial to the health of your baby. You're still 8 weeks away from your due date and although your child can survive outside the womb now, you shouldn't want to risk having him/her in the NICU for awhile. I had taken Magnesium Sulfate when I was pregnant with my daughter, and there were no problems nor did I have any type of reaction to it.|`|ZusC87WBaa	Your doctor must feel that the meds are safer than delivering your baby at this point.  Yes, you have the right to refuse, but I would suggest a serious discussion with your doctor about the pros and cons before making that decision.|`|v3LnJycKaa	in my research the benefits far out weight the risks, but with any medical treatment it is your choice, I would suggest research pros and cons before making any decisions though... at 32 weeks I would want to wait at least another 4 before that baby comes|`|MIK7ZLv5aa	well i had to have it when i wsa pregnant with both of my babies and believe me their fine...Gavin...2 is running around with feathers on is head screaming and Liam...1 is trying his best to keep up...All through out both of my pregnancies I was in and out of the hostpital...So finally in my 31 week with both I had to have the mag....(i had preclamsia and was going into premature laber)...then my dr induced at 37  weeks with both of them...the were completely fine..Gavin 7.8oz and Liam 8.pds and they were screaming thier heads off...so take it...you really dont want to go into early labor or die from preclamsia....    And he wouldn't be just find...my best friend had her baby at 34 weeks(we were pregnant at the same time) and the baby almost died...her lungs were to underdeveloped....she was in the NICU for 9 weeks...soooo PLEASE TAKE IT

lYsrCTCwaa	you could try putting a towel (folded once or twice) in the tub, and fill it up with a couple inches of water. This way the baby can have fun and kick in the water, but he's lying down, so you don't have to hold him. The towel prevents him from sliding around and is quite comfy on the hard tub. As for washing...I like those pre-soaped washcloths. Start with the head and body and do genitals last. You can always lube him up with baby lotion after. I love the smell of a baby!|`|VY4LqfLpaa	Fortunately for us our son can still fit in his little bath tub, but he is trying to sit up in it so its making for interesting baths now.  The tub that we have for him though has a big area at one end that he can sit in when he gets to where he is sitting unsupported...not sure what kind of a baby tub you have, but that is an option...plus what somebody else mentioned...the kitchen sink.    Here's the link for the little tub we have...  http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	if he sits up get a seat for the tub.. We do family bath once a week you can try get in with him and have your hubby or BF help clean him.. We do this cause my son loves the water so I hold his head to keep it afloat and let him float and kick .. HE LOVES IT>. Also then have this bath tub that has a shower to it.. there is a jug of water that has a fabric over it as a seat.. It keeps my son in an incline So I sit on the edge of the tub and put my foot in between his legs to help keep him up and give him a bath that way so after he is clean i let him play. You can also if you cant buy something right away fill the tub only up to his ears. that way you have water to clean him but not enough so he can get hurt and you dont have to keep his head above water... You can use a towel under him and an extra one uner his head.. This way its not a hard surface he is sleeping on but the fabric is soft to help hold his head above the water.. GL|`|ka8mjOVUaa	Hi, I know about that back breaking splash time. I found a tub that was able to carry the baby until toddler age, I don't know if you have a target in your local area. but they do sell them or either amazon.com. I have a nice area that I use is the counter top area in my bathroom. I first place towels around to catch water. and I sit her tub on top of the counter. it basically levels out. so that way I have better control and better hold of her. she is 10 months now. but if you have a counter top that is safe and leveled enough where you can bath her try it. Also I was told by my pediatrician to use dove sensitive soap it leaves a good clean smell after I have bathed her. try it and let me know. Good luck!!!.|`|85PmFNp3aa	Try the kitchen sink, or, if you can afford it, get one of those seats with the suction cups on the bottom they look like a plastic wheel, kind of. Anyway, put the babe in, and they really can't squirm anymore, and once in there, my son LOVED bathtime, because he had more freedom (he thought) and he was more secure, which made bathtime less stressful for me. Good luck! Then, do the thing where you put the soap on the washcloth instead of the water, and you should both be Clean, Shiny, and HAPPY!|`|q595MhH8aa	At 5 months old, I was taking baths with my little girl! My back also killed me bending over like that.  It really is not that dangerous!!!  You don't need to pour tons of soap in the water! Just get a good washcloth and add some baby soap and bath him!! Just make sure you have someone else in the room with you when its time to get him out! My husband would always be in there and get her out when it was time!!!|`|pXSKSS3daa	Get a bath sponge and let him lay on it(I got ours at Target for around $10). I did this with our son when he was in that in-between stage. I was able to sit on our bathroom floor and bathe him that way, you could also get a stool to sit on.    Another option is using the kitchen sink, it would be easier to hold him up since it's smaller and you'd be standing so there wouldn't be so much strain on your back.    ETA: I never pour the soap directly into the tub to make the water soapy. It's a waste in my opinion. Put the wash directly on a washcloth and wash your son that way.|`|HF97Rs9qaa	He must be at the point where he is close to sitting up on his own and you can buy a tub without a backrest or infnat positioner.    Ikea sells a blue baby tub that you can bath an infant or toddler in, I bought one to use it with my infant positioner, then when he is bigger he wo't need the positioner anymore and can still use the tub. You can put it up on your table and bathe him there to save your back and also use less soap and water.    You can also use your sink.    If you just prefer bathing him in your big tub you could buy a little chair or stool to sit on in the tub with him while you stay clothed. Babies really only need a few inches of water.|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	they do sell the seats that stick to the bottom of the tub they are about $10 dollars and he just sits in it|`|264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	Since my daughter started crawling she has just been in our regular bath tub.  I have a little cushioned stool by the tub for me to kneel on.  My daughter is now walking all the time and she keeps trying to stand in the bath, I just have to tell her no maybe 20x a bath and sit her back down.  She's starting to learn bath time is not for standing.  As to the 1/2 a bottle of baby soap...way too much!!  I don't put soap in the bath water.  I just let her play in the plain water for a bit then shampoo her hair and make lots of suds then use my hands and a wash cloth to clean her body.  I'll put a little soap on a wash cloth as well.  She always comes out smelling so fresh and clean..makes me want to use her soap :)  Good Luck, hope bathtime gets better for the both of you!|`|r5R2nstRaa	my daughter is six months, and i give her a bath in the kitchen sink! she loves it, and i can stand up! i also use the giggles and grins  wash and lotion. they have different smells instead of just the regular smell. like cucumber mellon, or coco nut. it still smells like a baby smell, but just a little hint of the other. good luck!|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	After my son grew out of the baby bath tub and before he grew into the big tub, I bathed him in the kitchen sink.  Just make sure it's freshly cleaned, lay a towel over the bottom of the sink to eliminate some of the silpperyness, and bath him in there.  Don't try to make the water soapy.  Just wash him like you would wash yourself.  Put the soap in your hands, or on a wash cloth and wash him up that way.  Most baby soaps are head to toe so you can wash their hair and everything with them.  If you want him to smell really really good the lotion is the trick.  Baths clean all the bad smells off and lotions put the good smell on.|`|OtbbKdITaa	Those seats the other person mentioned are great!|`|f0ZXgvP6aa	Definitely try the kitchen sink! I would put a wash cloth on the bottom to help with the slipping. I also soap up my son's diaper area before I put him in the water because I too felt like he wasn't getting clean, really helped. Around ten months I got a small blow up tub to put in the big tub and sit on a stool to watch him.
52bAHCaUaa	Not very high. I do know a woman that had her last child after having her tubes tied. However, my mother got her tubes tied at 32 years old, and hasn't had a period since she was 38. She kind of likes that. But she also thought it was very soon to not have a period anymore, I don't know how old you are, perhaps that is what's happened?|`|NWv9hOFYaa	You probably just want to be pregnant. Women life to feel they can still have kids even if they dodn't want anymore. I don't believe you can get pregnant with your tubes tied.  My mom had her menopause at age 34. Have you thought about that?  Good luck!|`|eV5E9MhUaa	Go get a blood test... is all I can say.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	It happen to some ladies but i guess why it happen it was not not done properly i hope and pray that you are ok.......................
HkWTYhjDaa	RELAX! I was once in your shoe. I have had 4 miscarriages before and now i am 17weeks pregnant.  I've had my internal scan from week4 and saw only 3mm(the doctor said it was too early) had another scan at 6weeks and found no improvement( the sac is not getting bigger anf saw no baby yet, the doctor scheduled me for d&c  if we cannot see the baby the next week. then the week past, my doctor made another scan to make sure if my baby had died or alive. He was so schocked to see my baby grown according to my dates, and there was a healthy heartbeat. i don't feel pregnant too until 8 week, when i started to throw up. <br>  Goodluck to you.|`|Nff6jJBiaa	i think u sholud fu ck again|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Symptoms don't always stick around for a long time. All you can do is wait and see what happens realy. There isn't anything you can do unfortunetly.|`|eu6UQElYaa	The only thing you really can do is try and relax.  At 5 weeks it's not abnormal to just see a sac.  No big worry there.   Do something that you enjoy to take your mind of things, you've got yourself all freaked out and probably freaked out for no reason.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	hcg levels are not accurate at all in determining anything, but your pregnant.you have all symptoms of pregnancy. and i have been told that when you have symptoms that its a sign of a good pregnancy. if your one of the lucky women, your symptoms will be light.  your not always going to feel pregnant. your going to feel that way till your baby is big enough to feel every day.|`|JtE7JDL6aa	I really want to comfort you but i cant  understand what you wrote. It doesn't make sense to me. All I can say  is pray for the best and whatever you do DONT STRESS YOURSELF OUT. Stress alone can cause a miscarriage. Just take it easy for the next 5 days. I know it seems like forever but hang in there.|`|AA11763588	Do you remember what you felt like the first time you miscarried?<br>  <br>  I don't want to stress you or scare you anymore than you already are, but from experience... my stomach was hard as a rock, which I found odd at 8 weeks, and I had a dull pain in my lower back. I started cramping badly and called my DR and told her it felt like I as in labor. She had me come in and see the other DR on duty and they did a transvaginal US, showed me the baby and his heartbeat, told me everything was fine. Later that night I started bleeding and clotting, the next day had another US and saw that his heart stopped.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying the same thing is going to happen to you, but you know your body better than anyone. I called for 4 hours before anyone would see me, I kept telling them I was having one. <br>  <br>  Try to just relax, drink plenty of water. If you start cramping and bleeding call your DR and get checked, it could be nothing or it could be something.<br>  <br>  I hope it all works out for you! Good luck.|`|vTfEYeKQaa	There's really not much  you can do. Just try not to stress too much, it's not good for the baby.  You can buy baby heart monitors so you can listen at home...it might ease the worry a little. You only have a few days left until your next appointment, so just try not to stress. If you're not bleeding or cramping heavily, then you should be fine.  As far as not having anymore symptoms of being pregnant...you can have all the symptoms one day, then wake up the next with none...they come and go. Look around for a baby heart monitor, it might help if you can hear your baby. Just make sure to go to the doctor if you have any bleeding or severe cramping.
J6X0JZkKaa	ok well considering that you got your period already i think there's a really good chance you're not pregnant.  even if it was light your period is your uterus shedding the egg and it's protective lining that it develops each month. An egg needs this lining to attach to and grow so therefore if your body has had it's period that means it shed all of that stuff.  Sore breasts, eating and sleeping a lot can just mean that your body is going through some hormonal changes that aren't necessarily linked to a pregnancy. i think you're fine but if you're still scared or if u haven't gotten your period again or if you happened to have sex again since your last one go ahead and take a test it doesnt matter what time of day.<br>  <br>  and as for the other question yes it is very possible to get pregnant when so little happened. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|FpOcoMERaa	Its okay hun. its very unlikely that you are pregnant. i had this same thing happen to me about 6 months ago, and i just worked myself into having symptoms. <br>  <br>  if you want a little extra relief, take a pregnancy test or go to a clinic and talk to someone who will give you more valuable information. most likely you are NOT pregnant|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take a test. It's the only way to know. You can test at any time of day seeing how long ago you had the sex that is making you worry.<br>  <br>  With that said seriously doubt you are pregnant. Seriously doubt it.|`|nhhCow4haa	The best time to take a test is right after you wake up from your nights sleep as you have held on for longer so there are more hormones in your wee, also take it about 4 weeks after you had sex, so you can be sure you didnt test too early. Its highly unlikely that you are pregnant and all the stress could have changed your period. But yes you could have got pregnant from that, men have pre *** which contain a small amount of sperm and can get you pregnant, if you are lucky enough to be that fertile. If you do find out you are pregnant i hope you make the best choice for the baby. Good luck with testing|`|iiMQhey6aa	Its most likely that you are not pregnant since your period came in Feb. but on the safe side, still take the pregnancy test.<br>  so dont panic yet.<br>  anyways have protected sex or dont have sex if you are worried about the aftermath !<br>  well i get back pains when my period is here..so dont worry!|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	Just make go see your physician asap!|`|uIAHkm0Naa	this is confusing..you kept going backwards...im sorry i wish i could help|`|4hNdYjjraa	yea its possible, but you said your breast were sore on the december the 10 but you wouldn't have been pregnant then as you didn't have it unprotected till jan, so your breast are just growing. But they wont get sore till after sickness or when you get sick. You can be pregnant but stress could have made your period slower and not last as long. I'm trying to say you have a chance to be pregnant but it your symptoms don't sound like there pregnancy. i would say they are but your breast were already sore. i think you are personally but i don't think your looking for the right symptoms. also you can have fatal pregnancy, were your body thinks its pregnant and acts it, even if is not! good luck hun. and don't worry bout the mistake of unprotected, its ok. everyone dos stupid things were they want to make love or are in love. don't let people beat you up for it.

P3e2kJtwaa	13.6 at 4 days of life is perfectly normal.  Even if baby was in a high risk category (such as preterm and coombs positive), 13.6 @ 4 days of life is ok.  Follow up with your pediatrician 1-2 days after leaving the hospital to make sure everything is still ok.<br>  If baby is feeding poorly, sleepy, not having as many wet diapers as expected, appears very yellow (or even orange), if baby has lost greater than 10% of birthweight, you should let your pediatrician know.<br>  <br>  Frequent feedings and making sure baby pees and poops are very important to work the bilirubin out of the body.<br>  Pediatricians DO NOT recommend giving water to your baby as a newborn, so please don't do that.<br>  <br>  If you have any other questions you can also message me privately.|`|0WYzUsjMaa	my son had jaundice, it is very normal for babies to get it and yes he will recover.<br>  To help it go away, put him in sunlight, not direct sun so he will get burn eg. when the sun is beaming in the house put him in the sunlight.<br>  Also keep his milk up so it will drain it out of him, this is hard cause jaundice will make him sleep alot.<br>  <br>  Dont stress about it too much, it will go away within 2 weeks max|`|hieQHR0daa	This is entirely normal and he will recover over the next 1-2 weeks maybe sooner. Sunlight will help as will small amounts of water. You cannot give water in large amounts to a newborn, it's not good for them but a teaspoon boiled cooled water between feeds (after or before a feed) will help wash this out of his system. If he were severely jaundiced he would be put under a "sunlamp" in hospital which would help reduce this.<br>  Try not to worry too much about it. He will be fine.|`|ufA96kziaa	My child had Jaundice at 3 days old and got over it within a week. A lot of babies get it and it is completely normal.

Her hormones were doubling every few days then only rose 35% so she was very worried. <br>  She had her latest scan and blood test today and her baby has a heart rate of 166 bpm and her hormone levels are doubling again. <br>  I know how she feels (and you of course) as I have suffered 4 mc myself and I also had a worrying scan with my 5th child when the foetal pole was not detected at 5 weeks.. She is now 4 years old. <br>  I just wanted you to hear our success stories... such things certainly helped me at the time and a less worried Mum is much better for the tiny person within. Good luck with your little blessing.
wKuQC4yTaa	if you take a test now it will come up with an accurate answer|`|buI2TVpvaa	Do a blood test to be sure.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	How about taking a test? That's the only way to know for sure.|`|xtT8EPm0aa	Sounds promising!  Many women never have nausea when pregnant and since you have missed 4 cycles it's very likely you are pregnant.  It is also common to have cramping like you may start and nothing arrives.  Better get a HPT to check it out before the trip to the Dr.|`|RfGTXlotaa	i think that you are... but have you been to the doctors to have a blood test done to confirm it??|`|lhqM4qhxaa	buy the over the counter pregnancy test, there is 99% accuracy and its quick result. take care|`|f6d23f05020d008e311e1a8124ad390eaa	Why are you asking us? Ask a pregnancy test. It might not work for a week or two depending on when you got pregnant, but there's no way any of us would know. Women can get cramps and sore breasts right before menstruation too, so that's not necessarily a sign that you're pregnant. Good luck with the pregnancy if you are pregnant!|`|Ka5SlXIjaa	Just buy a quick pregnancy test. They are quite cheap and you'll get the results fast enough.
Cx5Zo7IIaa	Buy some ear plugs and let her cry it out and stop breast feeding her to sleep. That's called a negative sleep association anything she can't do by herself to get herself to sleep is not good. All you can do is let her cry it out, it may take a few days or more but in the end it will be worth it. And don't mind your neighbors they will just have to understand you have a baby, it shouldn't be worth it to you to care what they think for a few nights if screaming will get her to sleep on her own every night. You can go in and check on her every 5, 10, 15 min as often as you like but do not pick her up or feed her. Pat her, say soothing words then leave. She will eventually get the point. Also expose her to lots of light and sunshine during the day to make her naturally sleepy at night, limit the time she naps during the day keep her up as much as you can. She is getting to the age where she can manipulate you, she knows if she cry long and hard enough she will get what she wants so you must not give in. She needs to learn night time is for sleeping.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	introduce the crib in a loving and happy way. start by having her take her day time naps in the crib. when she starts to look sleepy, put her in the crib.<br>  lay her on her side facing away from you and pat her bottom. when she stops crying, roll her to her back and walk out of the room.<br>  if she cries, walk back in, say nothing, avoid eye contact if you are likely to give in to her, roll her back on to her side and pat her bottom until the crying stops. then roll her back and walk out of the room.<br>  do this until she falls asleep. <br>  <br>  doing this during the day means sanity for your husband and your neighbours and you are more likely to cope during the day when you are less exhausted yourself.<br>  <br>  Once she's got the hang of day time naps in the crib you can beginning doing the same thing at night - or you may wish to try them both at the same time?<br>  <br>  remember to not allow her to fall asleep at the breast, not to let her fall asleep somewhere only to be put into the crib in her sleep and not to stop and start at methods. try them for a few days before trying the next method.<br>  <br>  you can try to soothe her with noise also. my son likes sleeping to classical music cds. that way he's used to having noise while he sleeps and i am able to be as loud as i like and he sleeps through.<br>  <br>  best of luck - i'm sure she'll adjust fine.|`|Gn3kqG8paa	Get some sort of soothing baby song, and see if that helps put her to bed. In most cases, if a baby hear something that's soothing to them, it can help put them asleep.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|I2gs5opxaa	ok yess i see|`|933YqFLNaa	There are many tapes/CD's out there with sounds to help babies sleep, we used to put a baby ben wind up clock near my son's crib to help him sleep.  Seemed to work very well.|`|bf03f3398ae59403fb987824b585b742aa	I had the same problem(having to breastfeed to get my daughter to sleep) Not sure if you use pacifiers but that's what I started doing at bed time. I would feed and then hold her (she would suck on the pacify er) and when she was really relaxed I would put her in her crib and make sure the lights are dim. I would softly sing to her or tell her a story till she eventually fell asleep(whilst stroking her face or arm). This took a few days as she wasn't sure why she wasn't lying with me in bed. Dont let her cry and cry though(she is too young) I let mine moan for a few minutes but always go back in the room and kiss her and stroke her face to reassure her that I haven't left her.<br>  <br>  Good luck! You'll eventually figure out what works for your baby as they are all different.|`|ptx1SrcTaa	Try to play with her more during the day.  Or evening.  Keep her up and don't let her nap too much. This will make her more tired at night when you are going to put her to bed.  When you place her in bed try and bundle her up tight, not too tight so she can't breathe but just enough so she feels like she is being held. Make sure the blanket smells like you and her room is warm enough.  Babies in their early months like to be held tightly, to feel protected because that's how it is in the womb.  She needs that feeling back to relax
dnG7fhnbaa	Are you taking folic acid? That can help...and it will aid your babys development in early pregnancy too...<br>  <br>  Also try "cycling" after sex...no, I don't mean get on a bike and pop to the shops...lie on your back and "cycle" your legs in the air...I don't know if it actually works, just a tip I read a few times when we were TTC, and something I did too...if nothing else it's good for a giggle! <br>  <br>  Good luck! Really hope you get your BFP soon! x|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It took me a year to get pregnant. I did everything you are doing cause really that's all you can do. It will happen. It takes time. :) Each month you actually only have about a 20% chance of getting pregnant because things have to be "just right". <br>  <br>  Keep at it and good luck!|`|ZtZIEREkaa	Hi, It took me 1yr & a half to finally fall pregnant with my first and i am pregnant with our 2nd and we had been trying since he was 3 months old and he will be 2 this april so it took me another 1& half give or take. Go onto an ovulation website to work out when your ovulating and go at it like rabbits for that week honey especially in the morning 'apparently' so I heard. Plus special note that both my babies will have the same birthday move so I figure I must only ovulate 1 month a year Maybe??? Goodluck|`|XO4talxxaa	We are kind of in the smae boat, i have a slightly tipted uterus, i have also been TTC#1 for 5 months!

We are just hoping and praying it happens soon! Good Luck and baby dust!
AA10091300	since it runs in the family there is already a great chance of you conceiving twins,,,there are no super foods to produce them it's all in the genes|`|6XR6ajTraa	african yams are worth a shot google pregnancy with yams and it'll give you info but it's still not a guarentee. Since you already have twins in your family it's a possiblilty that you could naturally anyway. Apparently the twin gene has to come from your mothers side. My nan (my fathers mother) was pregnant with twins boy and girl. Good luck.|`|HCmAoNjzaa	The twins in your family, are they fraternal or identical? If they are identical that is just sort of a fluke thing where 1 egg splits and becomes 2, genetics plays no part in identical twins. However if the twins are fraternal you are probably at an increased chance of having twins. I have heard that there is an African tribe that's diet mainly consists of yams (not sweet potatoes, yams) and they have the highest birthrate of twins in the world.|`|Hh9sRoZMaa	Well my girl.

xue72D76aa	If you would describe this pain like a knife cutting into you, you need to contact the doctor/hospital as soon as possible.  It could indicate a separation of the placenta which can be dangerous for both you and the baby.  <br>  <br>  If the pain is more mild, it might be ligament pain.  If the pain comes and goes, it could be contraction pain.<br>  <br>  EDIT - Based on your additional details, I would put in a call to your doctor's advice line.  A nurse will take your information and will contact the doctor and they will usually have the doc call you back within an hour.  I took a prenatal class and one of the things we were told to contact the doctor about immediately was a sharp, knife-like pain.  Good luck!

Why do so many people want to hurt these children by taking their mother and family away???? People are sick and disgusting to suggest that these kids be adopted out whether it is to brad/Angelina or to another couple. There is no reason for them to be "adopted out" unless neglect and abuse is PROVEN to be true. Why should these kids suffer because of "people" on the internet who thinks adoption solves all problems in life? Taking the kids away will solve nothing. It will only create new problems. And for those of you screaming that your tax money may be going to her: It will take much, much more tax money to "take" these kids away.

That problem you describe above is rare. However, absent fathers after divorce is not rare and it is very sad.

c7EKakQ9aa	this is heartbreaking stuff, both sides have there points and at first glance jade should have first priority, but on the other hand little nicole is to young to realise the profound seriousness of the situaction she is involved in, didn't anyone explain (in private) the issue of cancer with nicole and if so, why dont one of there parents take jade home if she feels sick and the other stay and play with nicole, i have young children of my own( 3,4,5yo) and know how difficult kids are to raise, perhaps YOU should volunteer to help by taking your cousin(s) out and spending time with them, life is a journey that has up's & down's and sometimes life isn't fair, but whenever you put a smile on someones face you are doing something that cannot be bought, you are doing things that shine a little light on someones soul and in return the light shine's on your soul.|`|buI2TVpvaa	Try and make Nicoleto understand that her parent loves her but Jade needs the attention now because of her sickness.She should learn to show her love too.|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	Im sorry are you trolling i have seen this question at least 10 times. exactly the same way.

Usually, since you and your body have already been through labor, you are more experienced and more effective at pushing, and your body is more flexible and has something of a "memory" of it's own so that it does alot of the necessary work faster and more efficiently.   <br>  <br>  When I had my first I was in labor for almost 17 hours.  She never turned properly and was face up instead of face down.  It took me THREE HOURS of pushing to deliver her.  In part because my body was experiencing it for the first time and in part because I didn't know what I was doing and couldn't push as effectively as I could the second time around.  Add to that the fact that she was harder to push out being turned the wrong way and it resulted in a very painful and exhausting process.<br>  <br>  With my second one.  I hit 4 cms. (fortunately I was in the hospital).  I got up to go to the bathroom. In the time it took me to walk from the bed to the bathroom I dilated completely and just barely made it back to the bed in time to call the nurse and doctor.  Once I was able to start pushing, I delivered the baby in three good pushes.  The whole thing took less than 7 minutes from full dilation to delivery.   That's just my experience though.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	My second labour was about a tenth of the time - it still hurt as much, but at least it was over a lot faster.<br>  I'd have 10 more kids if the labour was like my second.|`|a37f465fb3af30fb69356b87ea42c178aa	I had the quickest labor with my daughter - 43 minutes!! I barely got to the hospital in time! I'm now pregnant with my 2nd and have been told by many that it will more than likely be shorter!! I hope I don't have the baby in the car!! LOL!<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!!|`|KWaTVVpGaa	My first and third were both boys and both very easy. My second was my daughter and very painful! I had no medication at all with them though and my daughter was 9.5 pound s and 24 in long sooo. But for me nope, second was the hardest!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|I9tpJY4Maa	to my own personal experience every labour is different i have 3 children and the easiest one to give birth to was a 9 pounder good luck|`|cQq9vTTraa	i dont think so.my sisters first delivery was very easy than the second one.|`|5xSXJEVoaa	Actually as I am not married I do not know much but my sister's second labour was shorter and easier.Its different for everyone so|`|RGn4ry2zaa	Kind of. For me it was a been there, done that thing, so it went pretty good compared to my first.
VMASMHX6aa	Hi hun<br>  <br>  That's good that AF hasn't arrived!<br>  I think in theory you can ovulate 48 hours after a positive OPK. But I think that factors in that you don't really know at what point in your surge you are testing. So your surge could be well underway, or you could miss the beginning or the end of it.<br>  It's better to go by your temp shift as that's more accurate.<br>  <br>  Is your temp still up? If it's up past your usual LP length then that's a really good sign.<br>  <br>  Keep us posted!
VRSUyeqbaa	it should be a decision you and her make. isn't Harlow a boys name. no matter, at my house when we have children, he names the girls and i name the boys.|`|XJ0Nux6Naa	Err, hello? its you and her, in the relationship, not you, her and her mom. stuff that. tell her its you and her, and that you dont like the name harlow as a freakin first name. shes actually being quite selfish and rude to not even let you have a say in the baby's name. tell her you dont like it, but be calm and gentle with her.|`|412167FVaa	Keep cool ( easier said than done in  this situation) and calmly discuss the name issue again please.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Yes it should be up to the mother and the father.  Tell her you helped make the baby, the baby is just as much yours as it is hers and that her mother had nearly squat to do with the creation of this baby.   And you could tell her that Harlow is way to close to Harlot.|`|2eae4bf1e3779c435068e2d7d68a747faa	I hope I am not offending you but if<br>  1. You two are still young <br>  2. Still living at home<br>  Then yes, the mom is going to be helping her raise the baby. Mothers can be controlling or sometimes in the daughters eyes their bestfriend. Just tell her you feel she should at least take your feelings in part. But you better be there for her cause I had this problem with my ex.<br>  We were <br>  1. Not married<br>  2. I had a job, he was forced to get one<br>  3. I 23, and him 45<br>  4. Split up due his insecurities, false image and immaturity.<br>  Please don't be like us, he waited until the last minute (right after I had my c-section) to demand I give it his last name. When I didn't, he wrote a F**** threat note and left it on my bed. <br>  But if you are <br>  1) married and living together<br>  2) both working and what not<br>  Then maybe ask her to let you help with the name by coming up with a list that you two can agree upon (I tried that but he wanted it all his way)
iR9w7d7Yaa	There is no evidence AT ALL to suggest that ultrasound is dangerous to an unborn baby. In fact, the only thing that came out of the years of extensive research was that if you have more scans in pregnancy then there is more chance that your baby will be left-handed!<br>  Usually, the dating scan at 12 weeks and the anomaly scan at 18-22 weeks is enough with the added antenal visits with your midwife to know that everything is ok.<br>  Sometimes, people will have to have more scans i.e. if the placenta is lying low (which would usually have been picked up at the 20 weeks scan), growth measurements being too small etc.<br>  I have had to have regular scans from weeks 8-20 due to previous miscarriages and complications in pregnancy. I had my last scheduled scan on wednesday and i hopefully won't need another one now.<br>  It does cost the NHS money but the  main overheads are usually covered anyway i.e. staff wages, electricity etc.<br>  You can always get a private scan at any time and as often as you like/can afford.<br>  I hope this helps to answer your question. <br>  Louise xx|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	It's apparently not dangerous according to my midwife, as apparently there's no evidence to suggest that too many ultrasounds pose a risk. It's probably more the expense and the trouble of arranging them which is why they don't do any more than strictly necessary. I've had certainly more than just two scans because i had one at 7 weeks, 12, 16 and 20 weeks. Now that i'm heading into the later stages of my twin pregnancy, and my previous miscarriages taken into account, i'm still having them fairly regularly since the position of muffin 2 isn't conductive to vaginal delivery.. Especially since he looks as though he has no intention of budging.. Like Mistress K though, one of my twins hates the ultrasounds. He never seems to cooperate..|`|AA10192697	Scans are necessary unless there is a problem or you are high risk.  They are thousands of dollars (ultrasounds).  And it's not good for the baby to be exposed to the waves. It's like an x-ray|`|M5HyStReaa	my baby hates ultrasounds and even the doppler for heartbeat - he moves around so much more during them so there is definitely an effect on the baby even if it is only uncomfortable to their ears<br>  <br>  I only had the 20 week one to check no issues for home birth. If you don't intend to do anything on the results, then there is no point to them.|`|MFsuN8Doaa	It's because you don't need more than 2 scans in a normal pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Once you have had your scans, the midwife can tell if your baby is developing correctly, and if there are any cause for concern about the development of the baby then they will send you for another scan. <br>  <br>  Also, I think private scans are in the region of a couple of hundred pounds each.|`|JDw1RDcaaa	they cost ￡70-￡90 in the uk and you may might have more scans for them to check on your baby because i ended up with one at week 14, 21,23, 31 and 37 because they couldn't see everything at my 21 week scan so had to go for another then i have had to growth scans, so i would wait and see cuz most people end up with a growth scan.|`|rrtqwO9Waa	i seen a private gynacologist, from 26 weeks on i seen him every fortnight and he did an ultrasound each time i saw him, my daughter is now 3 and there was no harm done to her she is happy and healthy and it wasn't that expensive but i live in Australia.|`|Pp4F6D5Waa	I had 6 scans because my baby was breech, plus i had an ovarian cyst and he was a big baby, i dont think its dangerous, but it costs them alot, to get it done private it costs around ￡100 and ￡200 for 4d.|`|hqH1EZFSaa	I think it is not that expensive and it does not harm the baby, ultrasound is just sound that has a very high frequency that humans can not hear (>20000Hz).<br>  <br>  Hope this helped slightly.|`|JQjs3cB3aa	you can only get so many scans. the radiation ca damage you and the baby|`|9hxg6sjPaa	I'm guessing that they aren't cheap, and they have a chance of radiation.|`|mNzgWFkGaa	hello, I can only answer your question by giving you a perspective from another European country. In France it's usually 3 scans that you get in a normal pregnancy 12 weeks, 20-22 weeks and the final one 3 weeks before due date, while there is no evidence as such that these normal ultrasound scans are harmful to the future baby, none-the-less they are limited in a normal pregnancy as a measure of precaution. Scans are charged at between 50 and 150 Euro depending on the scan ( later scans are more expensive) and the gynaecologist treating you. State hospital scans are paid for by social security. To answer your question yes it does cost money each time if only purely in terms that the hospital has to pay the doctor, electricity, administration costs etc, for any hospital procedure. It is up to your local health authority in your country to decide how many scans a woman should have in a normal pregnancy though of course if there are complications then more scans will be needed to check that the baby is developing properly. They are not dangerous and don't bombard the baby with radiation if that's what your thinking, because it's a different type of scan Ultra sound. The authorities here frown upon these private clinics that offer 3 and 4 d scans as they are judged totally unnecessary and often the qualifications of  the people offering these scans can be put to question , are they real doctors? are they following guidelines properly? Is it just pandering to the natural desire to look at your baby and what happens if you see in detail and your baby has a handicap? not the best place to be told bad news like that.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	thats all the scans u need <br>  antenatal checks show them things are going ok and if any problems are picked up then u get more scans<br>  <br>  we use baby bond for gender scans they do lots of different scans if u just want reassurance but they are costly <br>  <a href="http://www.babybond.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babybond.com/</a>|`|KqloS80maa	ya i agree i wish they would do one more like at 35 weeks to see baby in correct positiona nd exact size and for the umbilical cord ...but i kno its harmful but ppl pay for them 4d things all the time!!

HM0cxcahaa	I had gestation diabetes with my first pregnancy. I was diet controlled. As far as the effects it had on me i gained more weight and i think it stressed me out, as well as the risk for ongoing type 2 diabetes increasing significantly for the next 10 years. As for my daughter she was born at almost 37 weeks and weighed 8 pounds (3.6kg) which was heavy due to all my sugar being passed on to her but other than that she was well and we were out of hospital in 2 days. Babies from mothers with GD tend to be larger, born earlier so they can have respiratory problems and tend to be born with high sugar levels themselves and can have a sugar crash.<br>  I can report though after she was born my GD went away and i did not get it with my subsequent pregnancy :)|`|KqloS80maa	your baby grows at a rapid rate so there usually bigger and of course liek u said they have to watch ur sugar other than ...nothing really|`|MtC3CWZraa	I think the main risk is having a larger baby, and that can obviously make delivery rough. There's nothing to say your baby will be large though.
yV373JUiaa	Omg! I love pre seed. lol I have raved about preseed on this site to many women. It helped my sister get pregnant and I started using it became pregnant (but lost my baby)<br>  <br>  What it is: a sperm friendly lubricant that mimics natural mucus of your cervix so that it actually helps the sperm along their way.<br>  <br>  It is the only lube on the market that doesnt kill sperm. <br>  <br>  It is a great investment even if you don't get pregnant right away with it because it makes sex feel soo great for you and him. <br>  <br>  It is not expensive I think I paid $12 for a tube thats lasted me 2 months. You can order it online at preseed.com.|`|CUanPEmeaa	I am using something similar to preseed called preconcieve plus. It is similar to preseed but you can buy it at CVS, some say walmart has it but in my area i got it at CVS. It was $16 US the box had a $2 coupon on it. It doesn't take much and you can apply it like you normally would any lubricant, during or before sex.  I am sure one thing will last through sevral cycles. It has helped alot during as clomid makes me very dry. I haven't heard to many success stories (just a few) like you can about preseed, but hopefully mine is.
rhypzNW8aa	To be honest i think you should hold off for a while,give her loads of information and answer any questions she has,'she's bound to be curious' but if that was me i'd wait until she's alittle older and more equipped to mentally deal with where she came from.You say you've only had her a year so let her adjust to life with you first.Sorry to confuse you as clearly i disagree with everyone else but they don't have to deal with the emotional backlash like you do.Trust your own instincts on this one,do whats best for the family,not just one part of it and best of luck.|`|QTVUkLUNaa	I think it is the right thing to do, to allow a child to know where they are from and if you are fine about them meeting with any relatives. However i think they should be warned of how things may be and what they can expect or may experience, it could be that they then decide against the decision to go, at least for awhile until they feel ready. Hopefully your daughters experience will be more positive than your sons.|`|c08c39bb7a1743575c2599b32315016aaa	You are the parent and responsible for making decisions.  I thought the adoption process was tough,  yet you are on here asking strangers about how to handle a situation!|`|QmWO1Kfbaa	I'm with No 1 , you can't deny her .|`|17103f1748af3e37b30568fa758fd4d3aa	I think you should take her. Perhaps look it up on the internet first, show her what it will be like, how different it is.|`|XKrdLIGnaa	Bring her. its only fair but warn her in advance about what happened to Sam|`|DZzBfzVeaa	You should give her a chance to see her family if she really wants too. You gave sam that chance and even though it wasnt a good experience he still got to see where he was from and im sure that ment a lot to him.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Take her.....and prepare her a little better than you did Samuel on what to expect.     Let Samuel and Alex know that the way they may be treated is not a reflection on him/her but on how locals feel about  you (a foreigner) taking children away from their homeland.  Many locals feel that you could/should have contributed to their community as an entity.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	If you took Sam then you should take Alexie.  Sam found out where he was from, that it was not a good place and that his family was mean.  He knows he's better off with you as his mom. :)  <br>  If you don't show Alexie she could think you love Sam more or don't want her to see where she's from because it could be better than where she is.<br>  <br>  As Nike says, "Just do it."|`|7JEojMgQaa	I understand this is different than any other aspect of her life where you can't protect her from certain harms, (hurt feelings) but its important to her as a person, to know where she comes from. I'm not talking about you did it for your son, so you should do it for your daughter, I'm talking her, as a person, needs to know. Besides you have no idea if she will be accepted or rejected. It may be a totally different scenario for her. That carries its own discomfort for your family. If she is accepted, and your son was not, it may be awkward for him again, but that is no reason to not take HER to her home country. That is just another part of life you can not protect him  from. <br>  <br>  I sincerely hope you take the opportunity to show your daughter her heritage.|`|bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	I think she should visit. I really praise you for allowing them to see the truth. Even though it was painful for Sam, in the future he may appreciate the fact that you took him and will perhaps motivate him to do something himself for similar families.<br>  <br>  If you think 13 is young, perhaps it might be a good idea to take her when she is a little bit older. But you know her maturity and whether she can cope with the emotional side to it. Even if she does find it difficult to visit, she can always confide in her adoptive brother about his similar experience. She definitely won't have to suffer alone. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	I think that taking her can be an education, but also that Samuel should be told that in the best of adoption situations, that first families have some jealous issues, and that the shock of being reunited is kind of like being a deer in the headlights of an oncoming semi.  Sometimes, you just freeze and don't know what to do, which even if it wasn't meant to be hateful, it could very well be taken that way.  <br>  <br>  To the family in Nairobi, imagine yourself in a situation where you were poor, people around you dying, and a distant relative showed up, from another country now,  obviously with money, and riches beyond your wildest dreams (to them you're extremely rich), and how would you act?<br>  <br>  Prepare your daughter for the disappointments of what can happen.  Try to make it a pleasant trip around the adoption reunification.  See the different sights and the good things about her native culture, visit the family after a few days of happy travels, and if it goes really well, then stay a little longer, and if it doesn't then go on to a happy type of vacation.  Plan on staying in a hotel ahead of time.  To stay with relatives in Nairobi, it could have been embarrassing to them, knowing your standards of living, and it could have been a lot more work to them and expense of things we take for granted.  Good luck in your travels.

ytGaDM7Haa	supposedly pregnancy tests are 99.9% accurate but if they show up positive they are 100% accurate. The only chance of being inaccurate is if they show a negative (then there's still a 0.9% chance you actually could be pregnant but it's too early to tell). So if it says you are pregnant, I would imagine it is accurate.|`|KqloS80maa	your baby is sooo small usually cant see the bean shape till about 7-9 weeks|`|ZHkhNY0Saa	you could be less than four weeks as inplantation could take up to a week so you could have just got pregnant so dates be slightly different to what the drs assume they always date you from the last period you had so might not have concieved until a lot later if that helps any i hope so<br>  dont panic though|`|1xsUVtzBaa	Its too early to see anything i would guess...wait 2 weeks and if there is still nothing i would suspect a chemical pregnancy or an early miscarriage...i had a blighted ovum..a empty sac with no baby or yolk sac showing at 12 weeks. At 6 weeks you should have a heart beat and a small sac with baby and yolk sac in tact..just wait and hopefully you will see your bub soon. The faint line means your Hcg levels are low and that can be expected at only 4 weeks.Very normal. Seeing as you caught this pregnancy early it may not stick so please dont get your hopes up..not until after the first trimester. Relax and let it happen and things will work out.<br>  Good luck :)

J9Tbun7naa	I was on the mini-pill from when my daughter was 5 weeks. I got my first period at around 8 months post partum...it lasted about a week, then I had a week off before it started again.... then I was fine for 2 weeks....then a week on, week off, week on...anyways....very erratic is the point.<br>  <br>  My doctor explained to me that the way the mini-pill works is it changes the lining of your uterus....makes it thinner...so it sheds away more easily...often without building up much. She compared it to a cliff face eroding....as it builds up just a little, it is unstable and therefore sheds.<br>  <br>  Hpe that makes sense and puts your mind at ease a bit|`|qjDxKXENaa	Yes it is normal on the first month. But if you have it the next month, you should see a doctor.
1hciyvKdaa	Maybe try slowing down at bedtime, make a routine, bathroom, wash hands, brush teeth, big smile in mirror, now jammies, and a book, babies in her lap, and then its time for bed. <br>  Regular daytime issues, as soon as shes misbehaving, gently pick her up with a smile, put her in her crib and say, ILl be back to get you int fifteen mins. Walk out and close the door, and cover your ears. Put away if your able the item causing the problem a toy or item you dont want her touching. Bring her out, and set her down to do somteing else. Its take repetition to learn at this age, always do it the same way, and yes it will be inconvient alot of the time, but its well worth staying on the routine and eventually you will see some imporovment. Babies are born to be taught, and if we start them with bad habits or too much room, they will push for more, its very hard to alter that taught behaviour. Sleepy kids can get over tired and not be able to unwind and fall asleep easily too. Its a tough time during these years, take it slow, and be persistant.|`|3tnVVFjHaa	how about a good smack.let her know you are the parent.and needs to do what she is told to do.|`|WQ8P57o3aa	I have a 2 year old daughter, turning 3 in April and I know the feeling. My daughter is actually very well behaved, she's a little angel really! What I do with my daughter, and suggest you do, is make her feel very relaxed before bedtime. Have "tubby time"..(that's bath time to you and me) then gently and calmly tuck her into bed with no television, and read her a bedtime story in a soothing voice. Then, kiss her goodnight and walk out the room. If she gets up and starts playing with her toys, take her toys away from her until she learns to behave. If she isn't playing with her toys but is just messing around in her room, gently pick her up and say calmly "bedtime darling" and put her back in her bed and give her a cuddle and a kiss. If she still won't listen firmly say "Playtime is for day, sleeping is for night".<br>  If she starts screaming and crying I would ignore her until she has finished her tantrum and calmed down, then try putting her back in her bed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|priviDmYaa	haha, this is rational, but may not work on a 2 year old. whaenever she wants something from you, like her cup, or wants you to see a drawing she did, or whatever, i dont know, haha, just "negotiate" and tell her that if you do that, she has to pay attention, or go to bed at whatever time, or whatever you want her to do|`|AA11198190	l think a bedtime story does wonders.....<br>  You are there with them...you make the story fun.....give them a kiss and a cuddle...<br>  And then they should be happy enough to settle for the night.|`|swiZhUN7aa	give her love <br>  when a child acts like show off that means shes trying to get a attention because she dosnt get it at home|`|Dwg5hqqmaa	how about we try hitting joe b for his stupid answer. i also have a 2 year old and w ebeen reading to him before he goes to  sleep and it hs been working. it might not work the first or secondtime but it will soon. just be consistent.

In my experience, a pre-lubricated condom doesn't have enough on it if the female isn't well lubed also. A dry condom is going to break. Either spend a little more time on foreplay or use an artificial lube.|`|5ZvALiclaa	well if they keep on breaking buy a different brand!

xue72D76aa	It depends on what kind of pain, I guess.  The release of hormones does cause the ligaments holding the pelvic bones together to soften which can result in pelvic groin pain.

X|`|6FY2FMwLaa	Hi,<br>  Ive 5 kids and they were all BIG babies, last time it was twins and I experienced the pain that you seem to be describing, its caused by the weight on the pelvic bone, if the pain is on the boney part at the front under the bikini line that's what it is,I used to get it on the one side of the bone but have known others to get it on both sides,<br>   it can be very sore & uncomfortable but it does ease but may come & go, depending on the way the baby is lying<br>  Hope that's put your minds at rest<br>  all the best to you both.|`|1xsUVtzBaa	Is the pain very bad or more like braxton hicks contractions? Is there bleeding? Any waters broken or a mucus plug seen?<br>  I would be seen at the ER if the pain continues or has any leakage of any sort? How is she feeling now?|`|mgyLplRnaa	What you are describing sounds like pubic bone pain and it is normal.  I had it starting at around 30 weeks myself.  The pubic bone area has the capability of spreading in order to allow the infant to pass through during delivery.  During the third trimester of pregnancy, a womans pelvis can begin spreading in preparation for delivery (this doesn't mean that she is near labor by any means).<br>  <br>  My pubic pain was so bad that I could no longer lay on my side, if I did I would have shooting pains when I tried to sit up.  By all means she should go see her doctor and he/she will confirm that pubic bone pain is completely normal and unfortunately there isn't much you can do about it.<br>  <br>  Suggest to your wife that she try sleeping sitting up with pillows proped up behind her (Like when you watch tv in bed)...this positon take pressure off the area and should help her a bit.  My pubic pain did not go away until a few weeks after I delivered my son, but it does go away eventually. <br>  <br>  Congratulations on your little one on the way!|`|ssDPdqZaaa	Its so hard to give an opinion on something like this. I will say, I remember having a couple days of harsh pain around the same time. I was told it was the babies head  in a spot that put pressure on my pelvis. I couldn't tell you if it was the same thing.  I guess I don't have any good answers.  but I think its very common around 30 + weeks to be very uncomfortable or even painful for women. there is probably nothing to fear. <br>  I think it a great idea that you are seeking medical advise, also I think your a great and caring husband, to be so concerned about your wife.<br>  She is very lucky to have you bye her side.<br>  The best of luck to the both of you!|`|MtC3CWZraa	Some pain is normal, but since you're not describing it or comparing it to anything, it's hard to help.<br>  <br>  Examples: I'm at the end of pregnancy, and I often feel like I've just been kicked in the crotch. That's something everyone can understand and relate to.|`|pMzq6B3paa	Its just pressure from the baby but it is good to check with the doctor anyway.

If you really can't live with him around, you'll have to be firm and say to him something like "I want you to move out by the end of June", to give him time to find somewhere to live. This gesture will actually help him be independent, but explain it in a way so that he knows he still has support from you if he gets in trouble. <br>  <br>  Another option would be to encourage him to go to university/college away from where you live, which might show him the benefits of not living at home. Indeed many students end up living in the area they studied in, or at least, learn responsibility and independence. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|2Z4G7aXZaa	You could e-mail him the address of a real estate site each week until he gets the message.  <br>  <br>  Or you could actually talk to him (yes I know it sounds risky) and tell him that you want to be a good parent and teach him how to be a self-functioning individual and that you can't do that while he's living with you.|`|b11d4406389c926e8457572221d6ce48aa	Just hide his xbox and keep the fridge empty, he'll move out in disgust.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	blindfold him, hand him fifty bucks and drop him off in the middle of the city.|`|nU7qyXkVaa	The Military is not a cure all.

They will call you back and advise you what to do.  <br>  <br>  Considering how high the fever is, I would give her children's Tylenol to lower the fever.  If she is not having any other symptoms it is possible that she has a urinary tract infection (often manifests as a fever with no other symptoms).

There's a part of the ceremony where they say something like "Now, clothed in white" and you then put the white blanket/shawl over them.<br>  <br>  <br>  ****<br>  No, you don't need the baby's DOB or name of date of baptism.  It's just a symbol of purity.  I take it you're talking about a Catholic ceremony here?  Just because other people are saying you don't need one if Lutheran/Protestant.  If it's a Catholic ceremony you will need one :)  We also get a baptismal candle too, the priest will usually provide this.|`|5ZvALiclaa	I've never heard of it. It depends on what religion you are. We're lutheran and they don't have that, but they give the child a baptismal candle to light on the anniversary of their baptism each year|`|e1122490267c2903bd14e9cbbfe2af5daa	Depends on the religion. Our Religion likes a christening Candle, so the child can use it through it's life on special events.

There is always a chance of pregnancy.|`|cQq9vTTraa	yes you can.|`|AA12395149	It is highly unlikely, but it can happen.  Some women ovulate funny like that.|`|CjJKUMl8aa	Depends.|`|tBaCFTtBaa	very little chance.  women generally ovulate 14 days after your period has started, so you are not ovulating yet.. but never say never.  good luck!|`|Pp4F6D5Waa	Doing sex??? hmmmm|`|RrduEmSiaa	No.|`|I9tpJY4Maa	yes

If your mum has showed you then you should know.
