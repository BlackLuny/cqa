But if you saw her now and showed her what you looked like she could be good mates with you, and as for this other guy; he has done nothing wrong to you so why try and break up a relationship that could be working. <br>  If you: <br>  Really like this girl <br>  Think that the other guy is wrong for her/treats her badly<br>  Or that she is unhappy <br>  <br>  THEN you can try and break up the relationship, but if you dont feel any of these then dont ruin something that will be happy. As you said you have slimmed down now so there will be other girls that are interested in you. <br>  Hope this helps

Just fill up your days with loads of stuff to do. But facing the pain when it comes is good too. Cry it out, wallow in it for a while. But knowing that you need to continue living as per usual. The world will not end with this. :) Good luck.<br>  May your wounds heal faster.|`|5CH6BfPfaa	Live how you used to. Don't avoid the person because when you're already healed, you will be surprised that he's around again. Just live normally. Let the pain remain until it fades. It takes time but it will eventually fade. Treat him as a friend.Go back to normal. It's the best thing to do. Let it all out then live your life again.

f534a428c6db5b8e865429b94a1c13c9aa	Oh boy, I was in a similar situation. It started off great then towards the end of the relationship he got more and more controlling and I was treated more like property. Well first you need to find a safe place that he doesnt know about or that others are around. Are your parents in town, can you move in with them? If not how about another friend? Do not move out right away by yourself. My ex started following me and found where I was staying and the only thing that I believe saved me was that I lived with another friend and he brother and they were able to help keep him away. Once you find a safe place then you need to move without him knowing. When he is at work get as much as you can out, if it is just a weeks worth of clothes so be it and leave him a note telling him it is over. Give him a few days to cool down and then call and tell him you and your friends (as many as you can get) will be coming to move your things out. Then cut it off, but keep an eye on yourself for awhile because he could stalk you. Good luck, if you need any advice email me, I was there one time, I get it.. buffchick25@yahoo.com|`|Yc6eUIW9aa	You need to call the police and tell them to go to his home with you so you can get your belongings because you are afraid he will hurt you.  They will go with you (follow you in car) and wait while you get your things.  Then you might want to get a restraining order against him so he can't come within so many feet of you.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	Run - run away fast. He doesn't love you, he is trying to control you.  It will only get worse from here.  He has trust issues and you don't want to be with someone that doesn't trust you.  <br>  <br>  But the biggest thing is that he is abusing you - don't let him do this.  Please get out now.  You deserve better than this jerk.  <br>  <br>  Run away and never look back...|`|HvbIE03saa	Get out, Get out, Get out...<br>  <br>  Seriously, the healthiest thing you can do is get the hell out.<br>  <br>  This guy doesn't love you, he wants to control you. You need to tell your friends and family, get them all together to help you move your things out of the apt. and get the hell away from him. If you have any strong male friends or relatives that can act as "body guards" while you're moving your things, then do so. If you don't, then get as many people to go with you to the apt. as possible. Not only will they facilitate you moving your things, but if there are witnesses, the likelihood of him being aggressive towards you lessens.<br>  <br>  Change your cell phone number, don't let him know where you're moving to, and let security at your work (if you have any) know that he is not allowed in the building. If he harasses you or threatens you in ANY way, you call the police and get a restraining order against him.<br>  <br>  But please, please, please, get out.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|crxbob5jaa	You need to get someone that will help you get your things out of the house while he is gone, and tell him that you are leaving after you have a safe place to live. He is dangerous and you might even need to get the law involved. Don't put yourself in this position any longer. Please get away from him before it gets worse. <br>  <br>  <br>  These people can help you with a plan if you don't have anyone else. <br>  <a href="http://www.njcbw.org/guide.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.njcbw.org/guide.htm</a><br>  <br>  If you prefer to stay in New York since you work there, you can find information at: <br>  <a href="http://www.msmc.la.edu/include/battered_women/shelters-newyork.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.msmc.la.edu/include/battered_...</a><br>  <br>  Please, please get away.

WsNLjEByaa	I dont think he is cheating but thats ot to say it hasnt popped in his mind.  He could have gotten the number from a friend who was keeping in touch with his ex or got it some where.  I would be warey but i dont think anyhing is going on.  Sometime men just like to have other girl s phone number for there pride, since i dont know your boy friend i couldnt tell you the exact.  I hope you find your answer and good luck.<br>  P.S- Heres a trick you could ask him to erase it if he hadnt already and if hes difficult when it comes to that then that could be a clue that he is cheating.  Now thats not the full answer he could erase and just get it again but just to tell you if he is cheating on you than hell be even more sneaky now that your on to a clue.|`|963197406e15fd38b56764ae446e40c7aa	just remove it and save yourself all the lies he is bound to tell you. next time he will look for it he will notice it gone and he can't ask you neither can he put it in again. but beware guys can be deceptive.|`|dJoE8yedaa	Delete it.

If you don't trust him you need to leave.  <br>  <br>  Maybe he has her # in case she gets his # and calls him he'll know not to answer.  How do you know she doesn't have his number she probably knows his friends and if she's a nutbag she will stop at nothing.  Maybe you should play with her phone and see if she has his #...  ya know by accident

Unless you have another _ u_sy hiding somewhere he is getting all he wants from you now. He is just hooking up with you, without needing or wanting a relationship.

The best is to be frank with guys and just say it how it is, thats the best option. <br>  <br>  Hope i helped :-)

Marriage is tough at times but, not like that.<br>  Good luck to you.|`|ab97da113204f1133543ea4510872e26aa	this is somehing that only you can work out asking all this advise will only confuse you go on your own gut feeling|`|xIwPjhojaa	Divorcing was her pushing you, and then reconciliation was her idea?? sounds over to me no cemestry!

2vgbJhlRaa	take control of your life again! what else? dont give him the power to control your life when hes not even in it!(or so i assume) LOVE YOURSELF! first and foremost never live for anyone but yourself. best of luck :)
DcbM4S4Uaa	No worries with it. My mate was the same until i talked her out of her shell. Is there anyone you can confess to? Well you have done on this so that is the first step i suppose. <br>  Just get yourself out there, you would be surprised at how many girls are like you, relationships with guys not working and are attracted to girls, just go for it and you will find out more then you thought. Normally going to gay bars and other such places, though most people dont like even mentioning these places or anything they are the best way to find people that you can talk to. Hell i have even to one and they are amazing places! <br>  Just have confidence in yourself and you will find out how special you are to someone. <br>  Hope this helps|`|FzFSzilmaa	yeah, cos girls NEVER cheat or lie or treat others like crap... [heavy on the sarcasm]<br>  <br>  sounds like you are obsessing about her... be careful that doesn't backfire on you...<br>  <br>  there are plenty of bisexual and lesbian girls out there.. you just have to know where to look... :D|`|1jIzBUkhaa	your not telling off on your self, better to know you then not know you . you just put everything on the table for us , now you can do the same fining a new sole mate. good luck|`|kbkbDhwLaa	It's kind of difficult to approach just anyone because you never know whether they are bisexual as well. It could get you into trouble as well. You just have to look in the right places when looking for another lesbian or bisexual. Women do understand other women better, but more loving? I wouldn't necessarily say that. Bad experiences can lead to generalizations regarding the opposite sex, but women do the same things. Women are just as liable to cheat as men are, as long as they allow themselves to be overcome with certain desires.|`|PltDCZljaa	your kidding us right??

And Im glad that you wanted to see me and I didnt come to that meeting... I know I mean something to you... and you will remember me and my love forever":) Make him feel guilty and be sarcastic...

Stop  letting him get to you. Live your life, respect yourself and be happy in yourself. If he wanted you, don't you think he'll make a little bit more of an effort. If you want him, tell him to get to his damn point and ask you to marry him or he must stop wasting your time.

I dont see why they would want to add you if they didnt like you, then again some people never grow up and want like 1,000 friends on facebook or myspace wich is something i cant understand. If they are still horrible to you then obviously you have to reject the request|`|URZeQfQCaa	Perhaps these horrible kids grew up, became more mature, and wish to add you as an act of friendship. Don't resent them for it, maybe just say hello and catch up.|`|IIbXpqmlaa	Because people just like to appear as though they have more real friends than they actually do.

I'm the same way with my husband, she probably does know that you have a lot of female friends but that doesn't bother her.  It could just be that she is secure in what you have and trust you. If you know how she feels about you and you feel the love from her then why question it.  Jealousy is not a form of love it is a form of insecurity.

Show him that you are a lot better off without him.|`|bXl12I4Baa	change get some one else .i am very sure you don the same think before.|`|5wVeLrXuaa	What ever you do just don't act like one of those crazy bitches from "Cheaters". LOL. But yes give him the silent treatment for a few days until he insists that you tell him whats wrong. Then you tell him something like "Im just not interested anymore." You must act like nothing is wrong and like you have been moving on these last few days. He will not know how to respond most men will try to put the GUILT TRIP but don't fall for it. Just tell him that you don't want to be with someone that lies to you because you know that you can have better. He gonna ask you what you are talking about but don't tell him...make him tell you he might just spill his guts about something else. You dont want to tell him what you know becuase then thats the only things that he will go by. Hope that makes sense. Anyway, he will probably try to start a fight or laugh about but that is just a disguise he truly feels like sh!t. Whatever you do dont fight back that will send him the messege that he is not even worth a fight to you. He will feel more like sh!t at this point. Then just leave. Dont talk to him for some time maybe a few days. Eventually, if he really loves you and he really regrets it and that is honestly sorry for his actions he will come back and this is the most painful part because here is where you decide if you will give him another chance (which in men's minds means that he might also get away with it next time and will have only yourself to blame) or kick him to the curve (wich also hurts if you love him). You must go with your heart and that is the best advice anyone on here will tell you. Hopefully if you take him back he wont do it again but for that he needs to be punished and equally hurt if not more. Its called tough love. Show no weakness or affection!<br>  <br>  Sniffie is right too! Stay calm!|`|XVVkrlnTaa	Whatever you do...remember to stay calm, try not to show how upset you are. Men like that will feed on your emotions. If you show him your true emotions he will go off to his mates and brag how heartbroken you are and how you can't get over him. You should just tell him that it is over. Try to do it in person, if it is too hard, give him a call. Answer all his question if he ask you anything. Just stay calm. If he see that he doesn't get emotion (crying) out of you this will disturb him very much. After you tell him it is over, you start cutting him out of your life. Try as much as possible as soon as possible. This will save you allot of heartache. And please don't be one of those couples who break-up and make-up like 100 times a year. If it is over...it is over.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Been there!!!!|`|RUfBeZNiaa	The best revenge is to do good in life. If he see's your life is going great,and also that you dont seem to give a dam about him...it will eat him up. I would(CALMLY) let him know that you know. Keep it short, sweet and anger-LESS. And then I'd simply cut him out of my life. No calls, no seeing me...if if he happens to see you in school or work or whatever....act like he dont exist. BUT NEVER LET EM SEE YA SWEAT!!|`|FzFSzilmaa	revenge is never the answer... just dump him and move on with your life...|`|DcbM4S4Uaa	Hun! Trust me on this, i have been there when the evidence is staring you in the face but you dont want to believe it. <br>  I am sorry but the best thing to do is to tell him that this is not going to happen to you. Show him that you are strong, that you wont take this kind of thing from any guy and make him feel bad about what he has done. <br>  What i did was look amazing when i saw him, i told him that i wanted to talk to him and we met up and i threw (literally) the evidence at him and told him that this is not going to happen and that it was over. Obviously if he wanted to be with you then he wouldnt have cheated, just keep that in your mind no matter how much he pleads with you that he loves you and everything. If he doesnt, like mine one did, and just walks off then you have got rid of a creep and that is the best way to move on. <br>  Just confront him and tell him to go crawl under the rock he came out of! <br>  Hope this helps and Good Luck!|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	hunnie the best thing you can do is just move on. i know the pain your feeling. me and my fiance were togeather for almost 3 years and i found out he was cheating with some hoe. i wanted to get revenge or do something, but i just let him go. i completely cut him out of my life and moved on... and let me tell you it was the best thing i could have ever done. i thought he was the one and i thought it couldnt get better... but now im with the man of my dreams & we are having our little one togeather. trust me sweetie... let him go. youll find someone whos worth your time, who will treat you like a queen... and youll look back and think about your ex and just laugh :) goodluck hun & keep your head up!|`|aY6EjDwjaa	seduce him with a ********<br>  then just as you start chew PROPER HARD on his belend.<br>  i mean crush that bastard<br>  then maybe squeeze his balls real hard just for good measure<br>  then, while he's writhing on the floor in pain, you tell him calmly why you have done this to him.<br>  thats what id do if i was a girl.. and therefore had no idea of ow miuch that would hurt.<br>  alot|`|uupTG4cIaa	Fill his shampoo bottle with veet hir remover.

5snO0Yngaa	What a precious girl you are. Very sweet. I wish that I could take you in my arms and give you a big cuddle. I have a lovely 14 year old daughter. I am a mother of two. I feel very much for you. I wish that I could help you. It is not nice to feel this sad about life, it is not nice to find out that your parents are human  and can make mistakes and probably will continue to do so in the future. <br>  I remember when I turned 16 and oneday, something happened at home and I realised that my parents were not perfect, I also realised that I should not try and expect them to be perfect and lead a good life. Parents make mistakes in their lives like everyone else. Please do not see this as your problem, see, you must not take the way your dad is acting to heart. He is not happy, he is not being honest and he is being deceptive. Why do you want someone like this to love you? You are a beautiful girl, you are intelligent and have the rest of your life in front of you. Put your energies into other things, like a sport, studies, music, something that you will benefit from. Do not let the negativity of this situation drag you down. You deserve better! Go and get it! Do positive and happy things. And let this selfish man drown in his own mess that he has made of his life. It does not affect you - if you choose it not to.<br>  I am disappointed by the school nurse. She obviously did not take the time and effort to listen to you properly. I found that some adults I talked to - just did not really understand. I just kept going to different adults until I found an adult that would listen to me and understand me. I know that you can find someone like this.<br>  I wish that I could be there for you.<br>  I will be thinking of you.<br>  You are the best and deserve the best - ensure that life gives you this, by not taking on other's problems and making them your own.<br>  You have a lifetime of experiences ahead of you, some of them will be happy and some of them sad.<br>  But we are given these experiences to learn from them.<br>  I will be frank with you and suggest that life is showing you this man, as a lesson to you. Life is telling you not to marry a man like this. Your mother did. Now, ensure that you do not do the same. there are alot of lovely genuine men out there that do not treat women this way. That are no selfish. That are loving and kind. Ensure that you learn from your mum's mistake and marry someone completely different. This will ensure that your daughter does not experience the same heartache and distress you are experiencing at this time.<br>  I know that you feel heartbroken by the things that your dad is saying to you. I know how you feel. My mum told me that she did not want me and that I was the cause of all her troubles. I survived that type of situation, by being independent. Throwing my head in the air and ensuring that I did not turn  out like her and did not treat my children in the same way.<br>  Learn from this and go forward in your life - creating a better life for yourself then your parents have done!<br>  You go girl!<br>  I believe in you.|`|SQkdULOlaa	Call and talk to someone who has the authority to help you and your family.

mx3gFmIKaa	The average wedding in a metropolitan area costs close to 30,000 dollars but weddings can be done for much much less expensive than that, though you'd be hard pressed to have it all for under 10,000.<br>  <br>  I think everyone is nervous on the wedding day.<br>  <br>  Among the big expenses is the reception.  How many people, open bar versus cash bar.  Buffet's can start at 28/a head, sit down's can go up to 135/a head.  Mine was 42/head 5 hr reception, open bar, with hot hors devours, we had close to 150 people, with the 18 percent gratuity it was 6000 dollars<br>  <br>  A tux shouldn't be much more than 100 dollars<br>  <br>  Flowers, depends what you want, we spent 30 dollars the day of the wedding at a flower shop, made four bouquets and tied some ribbon around them.  Some people spend 3000 dollars on flowers if you are decorating the church etc.<br>  <br>  Invitations-not a major expense, you can print them yourself with card stock for under 1/each.  For 100 people you will only need 50 invites.  Invitations can go up to 3 even 4 dollars each.  We spent 88 dollars, yep 88cents each<br>  <br>  A piano player I have no idea, my sister had violin players for her wedding ceremony, it was 350 for two of them for 45 minutes<br>  <br>  A photographer costs 1500-4000 dollars<br>  <br>  Cake 350 and up, sometimes its included with the reception<br>  <br>  The church cost us 1000 dollars.  300 for the church, 275 for the organist, 250 to the deacon, 150 to the pastor<br>  <br>  The wedding dress cost 1000 dollars for us.

Cheaper in the long run. The average rate of divorce is 2 out of 3 marriages fail. So whatever you two decide make sure it is the right decision so that your life together is just that until death do you part.<br>  <br>  You can spend anything from a few thousand bucks to the sky is the limit but the average wedding you are thinking about is about 30K.<br>  <br>  Best of luck mate.  I have been married for just on 40 years and wouldn't change a single thing, as life has been tough together but the good times always gets us through.|`|1xMTNTgkaa	My sister's wedding was the average traditional and not over the top at all and cost about $28,000.00. Scary cost I know but that was for the dress purchase and tuxedo(s) rental, invitations, rental hall for the reception, cake, ect.The church was free. Most churches are not free. My sister had a big wedding with all the details covered. I prefer the simple garden wedding with a few people. It really depends on what you want to spend. Get the budget first before anything. We should have done that with my sisters wedding. That was a big mistake we made the cost got of hand especially since this was 20 years ago. So set the cost you are willing to pay or family is willing to help with before you do anything else.<br>  You can if you want get married at City Hall for a marriage fee. Call and see how much it is for them to marry you and have a small get together after. If you are trying to keep costs down.

I think ours was about $30 or something close to that.<br>  As for the wedding, it can cost anywhere from the price of having it in a court and going to dinner at a family members house afterwards, to renting a huge church/venue and having a sit down dinner and hiring a band for dancing.  It honestly depends on what you want and how much money you have.<br>  The best plan is to ask parents/guardians what they plan to contribute, figure out what you plan to contribute, and start to budget cost.  And stick to your budget!  Don't be afraid to talk people down from their prices and shop around for the best deals.<br>  I don't know about a tux, my husband wore a suit.<br>  I play violin at wedding and usually charge $100 to do the whole wedding.  Call a local music school in your area to see about hiring a teacher or even one of the more advanced students.<br>  For flowers, we bought them online from Sam's club, they came in the mail, and were absolutely gorgeous!

You could have had better ground rules if you had said something.  Two women, one man a bad deal.  So who has Alec gone out with?  Who has he asked out?  This seems to be between you girls and he isn't even being mentioned.  Time to grow up.  It doesn't who you like if they don't feel the same way you are only going to get hurt.

She is Spaniard and Catholic,  she is conservative.  you have to brainwash her first and make her liberal, and make her move with you to the UK, so she can learn all our dirty liberal stuff.   (dirty considered to her).  she is practicing abstinence, but don't want to tell you, that's my guess. I don't think you should doubt in her, cheating, she might not do that, but she might be tempted, so keep doing sex every while, so that she don't cheat like some of those abstinent freaks.  <br>  <br>  You can talk to her.  <br>  <br>  and regarding immaturity, this is connected perhaps to less sex, less experience, more child-minded.   <br>  <br>  good luck,|`|1jIzBUkhaa	ask her if she love you are not. she need to stop being a child, and grown up. there are other girls that would love to have a nice guy .|`|i5MxtGENaa	totally agree ^^|`|FAr8ALwQaa	this is probably going to sound harsh and i know you've change and made lots of commitment for her, but she just doesnt sound like she's into it. she sounds very immature, and like she doesnt care for your feelings at all which is horrible. either have a serious talk with her or do the deed, because i dont think its fair for you to keep going with this for much longer.|`|Z3mHGD5Yaa	European chicks are all like this.

I think she still wants to be a girl, being with her friends and isn't willing to dedicate herself to one man.|`|d5f3e65ac4895a16eeeeaa09b2857623aa	She sounds spoiled.

I don't know your situation all I know is what I'm reading and I think that (wait I have to say this before I forget, the new tricks isn't necessarily a sign of cheating she could have watched flicks or read books, that's what I do when I want to do something different for the hubby). Ok it seems like she is very immature and selfish, you have given up a lot and you have obviously changed and matured a lot and I think that you should try to talk to her I mean really talk to her but hey there's only so much that a person should have to deal with.  If she won't love you the way that you deserve to be loved or treat you the way that you deserve to be treated then you should really consider moving on.  It'll hurt but if she isn't willing to at least try to meet you half way then it's honestly not worth it|`|vm3hfmqGaa	you cant make her be mature, all you can do is tell her that you need more commitment from her or you are going to have to move on. if she refuses to move in after 3.5 years, unless its a religious thing, that right there says to me that she isn't ready for the "move to Spain to be with her" kind of a commitment

Of course use your own judgment; you know more about the situation than anyone here does.
V12HSfNAaa	It's hard to get over your boyfriend. I've been there as well. You just need to find someone to take your mind off him. But like I said, that's really hard to do. But you are in an abusive relationship, so you have to get yourself some self-respect and self confidence and "dump him" although you've technically dumped him already. Go to a girls night out with your girlfriends and have some fun. You'll forget about him eventually. Oh but don't go thinking you'll meet the perfect guy on the disco...that's just a place full of all kinds of creeps... very few would actually make a decent date. Good luck to you sweetie :)|`|I2ZhcLVKaa	Get rid of him. You are giving yourself false hope. Move on to someone else better and cut him out of your life, and most important, stop having sex with him. If you keep letting him have sex with you, he will continue to do this and think it is okay and just use you for sex.  it isn't going to change anything. Run.. far and fast.|`|FGJV10tFaa	Just u try to busy in some other work. Forget this. You can't forget because u have had his taste. Nothing ...this all .... Wrong... Leave it.  Try to get good life.

Believe that you can get over this person. <br>  Get rid of everything that reminds you of this person pictures, gifts, phone number etc. <br>  Think to yourself. Was this person even treating me right? Did he/she make me cry or laugh more? Take some time and think things over. <br>  HAVE FUN! Go out with friends, go bowling, to a movie, ice skating, or even go on a vacation. Anything to take your mind off of your ex. <br>  If you don't want to spend money on a vacation, try to cook. Exercise also helps. <br>  Don't talk to the same friends that know him/her. <br>  Even though they don't always help, talk to your family. They are always there for you and they can definitely keep your mind off of things! <br>  Even if you and your ex agreed to be friends, cut off contact with this person for awhile. Make sure that when you talk to them again you don't have any leftover feelings. Find closure. You don't necessarily need a new partner, but make sure you are 100% over your ex before seeking friendship.|`|4vLt3SqFaa	Look up the word fool in the dictionary - your picture is there!<br>  <br>  Ditch the loser and find some self respect.  <br>  <br>  He isn't using you because you know what he is like - this is even sicker - you are the one who is intentionally allowing him you use and abuse your emotions and use your body sexually.  It is sad and sick.

You need to get to the bottom if this, the reasons behind what she done. it could be that she felt pressured into it and was week to resist. It could also be that she was craving more in the sexual sense. In the eyes of the world most people would say "just walk away" but you know your own heart and if you want to remain with her for a life time commitment then you need to show her you care, you can be upset and angry but you need to let her know you care. If on the other hand you can't forgive her, then you must end the relationship, if that is the answer, please do it respectfully for your and her sake. good luck my friend.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Cheating is cheating it doesn't matter who it is with.  She was unfaithful to you and lied to you, and then tried to dismiss it as a 'bit of fun'.  <br>  <br>  She seems willing to chuck what you have away for a 'bit of fun' and something that is a 'one off'.

A One Off Thing In My Opinion Is Fair, However She Went The Wrong Way About It. She Lied And That In My Eyes Is Unforgiveable.

HAk6iROaaa	How can we trust a stranger?
crxbob5jaa	That's something you and your boyfriend/fiance need to decide. If the two of you consider yourselves "officially" engaged, and agree on it, then it's official.

I mean i get married in 45 days so think about things like that before you go around ranting about the importance of rings.|`|mQSk7fB6aa	Yes, it's still an engagement.

Good Luck!|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Engagement is a declaration of your intention to wed. To me, an engagement is official when he asks, you say yes, and the two of you are ready to set the date, regardless of whether you have a ring. If you had to get married tomorrow, you would. <br>  <br>  If someone said, "I love you and want to marry you in five years," I might be very happy with the relationship but would not consider myself engaged, even if I had a ring on my finger.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Not really, I think its not official until you get the ring and then it becomes even more official when you set the date.<br>  I dont understand long engagements and promises to get married sometime in the next 5 years or so. Either you want to get married or not.<br>  We got engaged last April and set the date for this June 6th, its taken roughly a year to sort it all out so I think you could say we are officially official lol.<br>  Dont class yourself as engaged unless he proposes to you and you are wearing his ring and unless there are extenuating circumstances you should book the wedding too, it doesn't matter if its 2 years away but I would not hang around for 5, I think he is messing with you.|`|b4859935d2256537b4d4fe1dd1d4888faa	My husband and I got engaged without an 'official' ring.  We had another ring we used instead with a gorgeous blue stone that he had designed.  We told everyone we were engaged, it's just that he wanted to get me the perfect ring and he wanted to surprise me with the engagement.  So he proposed, gave me the blue ring, and then we picked out a ring together that his friend (a jeweler) made for us.  It took a few months to get it though because he's from IN and we live in MO so we had to wait for his dad to make a trip out here to bring it to us.  But we were still engaged before that.  And isn't an engagement ring sort of like a promise ring anyway?|`|1qTNn8qnaa	hmm...i dont know...maybe not cos theres no engagement ring...wat if u guys get a promise ring or something like that...as a symbol of ur promise and commitment...=) otherwise...this could be seen as one...an official thing i mean, whose to say its not...:S...gud luck|`|AA11380378	Nope.

SxI6y9GWaa	No, you don't HAVE to enjoy visiting your parents and you shouldn't feel guilty about not doing so.  You've only been gone a year and are obviously enjoying your new life and freedom and haven't yet had any disasters when you will find you really NEED your parents' comforting presence and advice.  However, you haven't yet completely broken those apron strings have you and your parents haven't yet accepted that their little baby has flown the nest. They obviously miss you (the constant trying to get you to come home indicates this) but are not yet ready to understand that you have your own life to lead and can't quite handle it properly when they do see you - hence the preaching.  This situation is as difficult for them as it is for you. How does your sister manage?  Does she get the same preaching from them and how does she handle it? Are you able to talk to her about it to get some ideas for yourself?   Ultimately, you shouldn't have to make excuses about not visiting.  Why would visiting them mean you have to stay a month this time when you are able to stay for just a week at other times?  I don't quite understand that.  Visiting regularly for short periods of time is a good thing even though you do find it trying.  This gets them used to the fact that although you are 'gone', you haven't totally abandoned them.  If you really don't wish to visit when your sister does, then don't.  Just say you cannot come but you will see them at Easter.  In the long run though, have you ever thought about writing to your parents to say how you feel? A letter can be read and re-read so its contents can be fully digested without an argument intervening.  If you decided to write to them you'd have to be really diplomatic and careful how you put things down so as to avoid hurting their feelings.  Telling them they are good people and have always treated you well is a good start.  You could say that you understand why they disapprove of your lifestyle and that you know they mean only the best for you, but you are trying to stand on your own two feet and know you make mistakes.  Tell them this makes you feel guilty each time you visit because you don't like to see them being hurt by your presence.  It could make them look at things from your point of view and act a bit differently in future.  Make sure your letter is perfect before you post it to them.  Read it as if you were your mother reading it and make sure it isn't accusing in any way.  Difficult, but I'm sure you can manage it.|`|eEbqfYUTaa	drinking is not bad if you dont get drunk and make trouble. but if you really feel guilty so why dont sou stop and show it to your parent that youve changed. visit them and be sorry to them|`|ICGxM45qaa	You shouldn't feel guilty in the least. It sounds like the main reason you don't want to go back is that they are emotionally abusive to you when you DO visit them. Just be thankful that you were able to get away from such a damaging relationship. As for advice on excuses to make for not visiting them, I'd tell them the truth. I'd tell them that they make your experiences with visiting them unpleasant with their emotional abuse and judgmental, controlling behavior, and if they can't accept you for who you are, then you don't want to visit them. Honesty truly is the best policy in situations like this. Again, you have absolutely no reason to feel guilty... that's a tactic that they have used to control you, and it's not fair and it's not right. You don't deserve that.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	I wouldn't make excuses. I would simply tell them the truth. Otherwise they will always treat you like this. It won't hurt their feelings if you word it right. Write it in a letter, so they will have a chance to absorb it and think about it before they react. I think they would appreciate the honesty. I would blame it more on the boredom than the guilt trips, but I would mention both. This part is especially important : "have "talks" with me about how im such a sinful person blah blah blah (the biggest sin i commit is i drink occasionally, my parents are very religious) and they just make me feel guilty the whole time im there." I would mention it and say "I am a good person, and I don't deserve to feel like that," or something along those lines.<br>  No reason to feel guilty though. You are your own person, with your own life to live, and your own feelings to live with. Hope this helps.|`|WfpKbz3qaa	u should visit your parents, you don't know how long you will have them for. <br>  if you really don't want to go, I suggest you ask them over to your place for a bit?|`|oRzqWhsDaa	they may drive you crazy but they have loved you your whole life so love them back because you never know if something terrible would happen and you wouldnt have them|`|kHRD7uUAaa	first you should tell them how you feel maybe talk to your mother who which ever one is easiest to talk to.  then i would just have short visits no more week long visits that is a long time and a month is way to long.

Your 21 now so go to bar hang out buy a couple girls drink and get some numbers, you really got nothing to lose.|`|QwXIsKAhaa	go to a club, u see a girl, shes walking away, lightly squeeze her elbow, and ask "where ar eu going?" and smile at her, and she'll come to u.<br>  <br>  trust me.|`|3ISGQ4Csaa	Welcome to the lonely gang|`|0vo7tDP5aa	well the real answer to success is actually one that you said you didn't want to hear, and that is to be confident. however, this is meaningless if this is all that people say. you have to learn how to be confident and what actions and behavior will tell a girl that you are confident. <br>  <br>  first off. on the most basic level. walk around with your head up straight and looking ahead. this shows that you are confident in yourself and that you own the space that you're in. also look people in the eye. especially girls, although you should practice on everybody. this also shows confidence. with any female whatsoever, do not be the first one to break the eye contact. wait until they break it with you. <br>  <br>  secondly, start striking up random conversations with people. it can be anybody under the sun. the point of this exercise is to start getting comfortable saying something to EVERYONE. this way, when a girl that you want to talk to comes around, it'll be a piece of cake. talk to everybody. it doesnt have to be anything major. just small talk is fine. talk to the cashiers, etc. guy or girl. doesn't matter. beat that into your head. talk. to. everybody!<br>  <br>  thirdly, once you strike up a convo with a girl, try to get her number at the end of the convo. if the talk went well, and you guys are flirting for a while, then take out your phone, and tell her to give you her number so you guys can finish that convo over some coffee sometime. you have to do this like you mean it, and like you've done it a million times though. be assertive and confident. fake it if you have to. <br>  <br>  these are the very basics, with tons of details left out, but i dont wanna type that much. this should give you the basic idea of what you should be doing every time you go out. it will help get you started on getting dates.|`|B7mzzhZ5aa	your not desperate! just lonely. go out with your friends its just as fun if not funner! go to clubs and parties and talk to people bet you will meet someone you really like. you have to socialise to meet people and have fun! its okay to want a relationship, just dont rush it or it could end up messy!|`|E23s2wSNaa	just be yourself dude, there is no rule to finding someone it happens than it happens, people think there are rules but thats what makes it more complicated, just be yourself and do the best u can to get a girls atteention than ask her out, that simple, good luck!|`|QQNFrlZRaa	try eharmony.com  google it i probley spelled it wrong
djUMvICoaa	It's not you that is really being represented by those captions, it's her.  We all know of people who want to do bad things to others and she is one of them.  Posting those pics the way she has proves it.  Just remember what is true  and most people understand that.  They may laugh at the captions but a lot of them also wonder why she is being so petty.  Getting you annoyed was her aim and it worked.  Don't let her know it annoys you.  That is the one thing that will stop it.  Even to your friends say yeah, I saw and I thought it was dumb.  If she even hears that you said more than that she will continue.  It is what motivates her.|`|3mHThmzLaa	please remember not make this type of friend for future safety|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	you could try to contact the website that she put the pictures on.
3a7cc492443eeeac6f0d36cf9e09ec8daa	1. If she likes you enough, and isn't really mysterious she'll tell you herself. Till then, don't worry about it and continue making her laugh and enjoy yourself. It's possible she thought it was any of the two, but don't focus on understanding her and just be cool. Not too cool then you'll look like an idiot.<br>  <br>  2. Usually, women have a special gaze they give you when they are attracted to you. It's a deep longing gaze and thats the most obvious sign. Another sign is her laughing at all your jokes, even the bad ones. Others are stroking her hair, or crossing and uncrossing depending on the woman. <br>  <br>  3. For the second 'date', don't do anything romantic. It puts too much pressure on her to make a decision so soon. She might not even know how she feels about you. So do something crazy and fun, and make sure she has an amazing night. <br>  <br>  Most importantly, be yourself. Make her laugh and make your time together memorable. It should be good.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	1.  doubt that she is married or she probably would not have accepted to hang out.<br>  2.  she tolerated you for four hours.  you were at least entertaining and apparently didnt frighten her <br>  3.  okay you go ahead and ask her out a second time.  good for you.  roses will give her an inkling that you care what she thinks about you cuz you want to impress her. (the ball is in her court)  otherwise, tell her something about why you wanted to give her flowers.  (the ball is in your court by what you say here) ;)  good luck!|`|nUdbTUtHaa	If you like her ask her out (if she's not single she'll let you know at that point lol)<br>  <br>  my best advice though, dont over do it with flowers, bouquets of roses are kind of serious imo (even if they're small) Just get one single flower if you want to be classy, one single simple flower : ) It'll make her smile, but wont make her feel awkward like a lavish bouquet might ^^|`|BjA1aZd9aa	Do u want get marry with her or just time pass.......if she is a nice girl so don't let her go from your life ... read her eyes, her face.. if you have her number so call her and ask all personal things you need but not directly.....Try to be very punctuall, hardworking and sincere, when she will see good things in you, she will attract by you automatically..|`|q9bq625Kaa	Well about being single.  You will have to ask her. Or just go with the Flow she will tell you herself.  Maybe she wants to cheat on her partner so all lies upto you.  She definately likes you  if she laughed at your jokes and gave you a nice warm hug. Buy her all you can.|`|BiSuCnMUaa	I dont think she wdv gone out with you if shes not single ! secondly you can simply ask her ..knowing if she liked you would be obvious if she was into the conversation or not and if she laughed that means she liked the outing.... roses would be sweeeeeeeet haha;) <br>  Goodluck|`|dJoE8yedaa	Ask her out. Not all ladies are like me to initiate a relationship. Most expect a guy to make that move. Ask her what you need to know. She's the only one who can answer certain questions. Good luck.
ab97da113204f1133543ea4510872e26aa	it could only work or be fair if you would have to be equal in the way that i had the same freedom and you should do the same|`|st9KHhoKaa	i went to a strip club on two occasions because i had recieved a tip off from a male friend that my ex boyfriend was there ALL THE TIME.<br>  <br>  so i paid ten bucks, walked in and laughed. <br>  <br>  the girls had nice figures, and not pretty faces. they looked common, hard. they wore not many clothes, g strings, knee high boots. <br>  <br>  they had all the guys in the room fooled, these women had these guys believing that they were in love with them and interested in them. they only wanted to lure them in, and then take their money. <br>  <br>  i saw these strippers use all the tricks of the trade to get these guys money. <br>  <br>  i actually saw a naked girl for the first time and though "oh wow thats different" its kinda wierd seeing another naked woman even if you see yourself in the mirror everyday. <br>  <br>  After staying for half n hour, i was really digusted to think why would these girls not care that sleazy, disgusting men wanted to look at their naked bodies. <br>  <br>  Plus i caught my ex and said " enjoy your night" haha!!"|`|FzFSzilmaa	no problems at all here... though i'd love to go along and watch the debauchery... strip clubs for women are a lot more sex filled than those for men!!! :D|`|a0024a8805bd3c2a385199e722566faeaa	Everytime my woman has gone to a strip club she's come back horny and tipsy!<br>  <br>  No problems here.|`|e7302da69a66d35643b221f8f86ec06daa	I don't see the point of either sex going to a strip club.  Why pay for expensive drinks and give your money away to some stranger?  And you're not trying to hook up?  Would you go to a restaurant and pay to check out a meal but not eat it?  Not me.  I see it as a character flaw, but to each their own.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	I'd be fine with it. However, she has less interest in that sort of thing than I do and I've only been to them about 5 times in my 38 years (3 of which were bachelor parties and the other 2 times were simply guy friends wanting to go and I tagged a long).  <br>  <br>  I just don't get the attraction, its not like the majority of people get to have sex with these strippers so why get yourself all worked up?  If you don't have a significant other to be intimate with and your feeling the urge there are plenty of other sources to get you hot & bothered (assuming you can't get off with-out it).
QjIhIFnPaa	Leave her.<br>  <br>  I hate saying this stuff to people but,<br>  Your rebound.<br>  <br>  If someone is strung up on somebody else, do you really want to be just the other person? Knowing that your girl likes somebody else more.<br>  <br>  No you dont, you deserve better than that. The girl probably is just confiding in you for comfort, as people in long term relationships get used to having another person there to make them feel secure.<br>  <br>  But you don't want to be in this situation darl, truly, get out while you can.<br>  If your feelings are very very strong, then i suggest cutting off all communication to her, to give you time to find yourself.<br>  <br>  If there not that strong, tell her you just want to be friends, and also explain that you have feelings for her. Ask her straight out, but trust me, please, do not get into a relationship where you won't be the special one.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped! good luck|`|CeJIomWXaa	keep on treating her good until she's made her decision to be with you or not with you. <br>  <br>  you both got into it with no official commitment, just for good company and fun, so give her the space to choose emotionally. <br>  <br>  keep on being there, hang in there. if she choose you, take it up a level and take her out like on a romantic date. if she wants to be with the other guy then just back away and let he be. whp knows maybe you'll run into each other again in the future.<br>  <br>  best wishes mate|`|Kmhx6AlAaa	If she likes another guy there's not a chance you can change how she feels about him.<br>  I would say break it off before anyone gets hurt. It's better if you let her go & tell her that it's not what you want.<br>  Then just ignore her. If she really likes you she will come running back, otherwise it's her loss.<br>  Good Luck :)|`|t8gYx9LIaa	If she goes for him then let her. You should never have to fight for someones affection from someone else. It causes too much heartache and if the thought is hurting you then imagine how it would feel if she was seeing both of you at the same time.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|YsDwo7Dqaa	Let her go, if she likes this other guy just leave it.|`|iTJ2YIH5aa	move out right now otherwise u will become her mental slave.|`|0IG3lEpaaa	Hold on to your dignity and self respect. Cut her totally loose and don't let her hear from you or see you again! This might  make her more interested in you. If you try to hold on to her she will think you are desperate and loose respect for you. Let her think that you care very much for her and want to keep her in your life, but hey, if she likes this other guy better than have a nice life...|`|v3bhi62Kaa	Seriously it seems like you are a cool guy. I definitely don’t think you should be treated as second best when it comes to this guy who ever he is. Your better than that. You need to be the only guy in her life if not then it’s a no. Because then you’re gonna start feeling bad for yourself and you don’t need that. You’re great you need to tell her off. She doesn’t deserve you. Plus if a girl would do this to you when you really liked then she’s a whatever let’s move on case. I know you really like her but you don’t deserve to have a girl you really like also like somebody else and have her being with you and him. That’s not cool. I’d say break it off she’s not even worth your time. Find a better prettier girl who cares about you and who you are number one in their life. Hope things turn out well.|`|YHmjpcdDaa	M8 you said "She doesn't want a relationship". This means move on otherwise you will be setting yourself up for a lot of pain.|`|ZG3Xiup3aa	I'll say let her be but you still can chat with her but don't let that kid know that u hang out with her.|`|RzxlBU1haa	I'm 21 and i had this exact same problem. Listen just dump her before she dumps you. I know it hurts a lot that she likes someone more than you. (it almost killed me because i felt like i wasn't good enough for her). But anyway best way is to move on because you can't change who she likes or dislikes.|`|AA10170420	the same situation happened to me. couldn't do anything about it. we finally broke up.<br>  it's gonna be an extra pressure on the relationship. so the best thing is to break up now and tell her why you are breaking up. so if she really cares about you, she is gonna kick the guy out of the picture ;)|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	Call an end to this damaging relationship.  You know in your heart that no one deserves to be second fiddle.  she is not quite as nice as the person you thought she was if she can keep you dangling on a string like this.  Take that as some comfort as you move on.|`|AA10272321	It doesn't sound like she's interested in a committed relationship. Just move on, and avoid the drama...|`|3sKU83sPaa	If you're getting a bit jealous, you need to acknowledge that your feelings won't allow you to "keep it casual."<br>  <br>  End it. Let her know that if she's ready for a relationship with you at some point, you may or may not be available. But what kind of quasi-relationship (casual as it may be) are you having if she's interested in someone else? Sounds like a bundle of trouble that you should flee. <br>  <br>  As a fellow female, well, I'd have to say that she's sticking with you because she doesn't want to be alone. Girls like to have filler guys while they wait for the right one to come along. It's harsh, but it's reality. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!
NAwWqDMAaa	it sounds like she doesnt really care for you as a friend maybe she just is not bothered. ive had this problem with a mate before what i did was talk to her about it and tell her how i felt. just say something like "i need to get something off my chest which has been bugging me for some time now, okay right i feel like a give and give as a friend but dont get anything back,im constantly doing everything you ask of me and all the favours and advice you need but when i ask you, your not bothered, im really confused, i get the feeling your not bothered about our friendship" good luck x x|`|jrdtQi04aa	YES. YES. YES.  you are being used and taken advantage of by your friend.  If you dont mind, then go ahead, but be aware that when you need some help, she probably wont be there.  How about taking some time to do things for your other friends who will help you out in return?  Just think about it,  Try not being there for her, and see if she still thinks you are such a great person.  Sometimes you have to step back a little and observe someone's behaviour.  If she's using you, then it will come to the light.  You will know by her reaction if you arent there for her a time or two.  I am going through the same thing right now, and I am just a bit angry about it.|`|RIw8uxLjaa	i guess your friend is best described as "INSENSITIVE" and not a user.<br>  <br>  but as what you've said, you are happy doing those things. anyway in the first place helping is not expecting something in return. if you do help, then do not expect things in return. but then if you think you are being use, then the power is in your hand to stop her. if you continue to allow her doing that, then its your err already. stop doing anything favorable to her, and find out what her reaction will be.<br>  <br>  remember, an error doesn't become a mistake, until you refuse to correct it.|`|HsuoFa6qaa	I think she is taking advantage of you. But it depends on how she treats you otherwise. If she actually has fun with you and she considers you as a friend and she jokes around you and stuff then that would mean that she likes you as a friend too. But if not...then she's simply taking advantage of you. <br>  <br>  I suggest that the next time she asks u for something...refuse....see her reaction. I f she gets angry then she's clearly just taking advantage of you...if not then she's truly yor friend.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =D|`|9Xm6LOIRaa	Yes. I also experienced that years ago. But a nice conversation would resolve it.|`|IKO00um5aa	Tell her how you feel, let her know that friendships are a two way deal. <br>  <br>  Even though you may like feeling needed you still can't let her use you. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3mHThmzLaa	no friend no one can use you but when u help someone then always  try  to ignore that u can help|`|ymWkGqm7aa	Your friends are probably right. Stop doing everything she asks or talk to her about it.|`|e7302da69a66d35643b221f8f86ec06daa	Yeah, if she won't do things for you but will keep asking for you to do things for her then she's using you.  You have to be more careful who you donate your energy to.|`|HvbIE03saa	She may not realize what she's doing, but by what you describe it does sound as if she's taking advantage of you.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is talk to her about it. Tell her what you said here, that it makes you happy to be able to help her, but that you don't feel that it is being reciprocated. If, after bringing it to her attention, her behavior changes, then that's great. If not, then chances are that she really is only in it to get out of you what she can.<br>  <br>  Good luck : )|`|djUMvICoaa	When someone doesn't do something in return for many favors done for them then you are being used.  It's in your answer, you like being needed.  Listen to your friend.  You have to get a handle on this now to keep from being used in other ways that will be more hurtful, especially when you start adding love into the mixture..|`|AA11399389	Since she rarely reciprocates, then yes, you are being used big time.  <br>  <br>  Try doing some volunteer work - they need you too and would appreciate your help!|`|seqEdwwnaa	yes she def. is taking advantage of you...dont do EVERYTHING for her
edQtiiGqaa	i really dont know, but i agree. black men seem to be stereo typed as players, maybe theyre all just livin up to it. but there are still some great ones out there.|`|3a7cc492443eeeac6f0d36cf9e09ec8daa	I'm good and hot black man and I'm here.<br>  <br>  I believe that it's maybe you have what I have, is perhaps a dangerous addiction to flawed and crazy personalities. I've dated women that were flawed and enjoyed it, and everytime I get out of a relationship and get attracted to someone else it's someone who's flawed as well.<br>  <br>  Maybe we don't know what we're worth and put looks before qualities. Or maybe that's just me.|`|d5f3e65ac4895a16eeeeaa09b2857623aa	I think your making a hasty generalization. I know that black men are the ones we see as "gangstas" and whatever, but their are also lots of other black men who turn out to be nice. It's not the race, its the person.|`|EnTymOKfaa	because they think theyre too "gangsta" and stuff.<br>  so their like " she juss a hoe "<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  yea.<br>  they think they look cool.|`|FzFSzilmaa	perhaps cos you have 2 kids by 2 different black guys... so they think you just aren't serious...|`|hdp7bv45aa	Not all black men I'm a black man and I don't treat women like sh*t or play games and I'm not a gangsta or thug|`|73Iasdntaa	Good and bad is international,it has no color!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Just be patient,sooner or later The One will come along!|`|wdk3Ke6qaa	..I don't know any black man that's like that.

Why do people do that, like if a persons cheated on by a man, they think " all men are dogs!" WTF how about, the men you've met are dogs. JUST LIKE specifically the black men you've met were dogs, not ALL black men! Damn man. Stuff like this is so annoying. I don't care whether your black or you have children from black men, it doesn't make it right to generalize.|`|b9uOax0aaa	Because that is what they have been taught.|`|h8fp5qs0aa	that's a bit of a generalisation.

My cousin is married to a black guy and he treats her and all her kids well.|`|e7302da69a66d35643b221f8f86ec06daa	You answered your own question.  You're looking for "good and hot".  It's the hot part that gets you in trouble.  Look shallow and get shallow, look deep and get deep.|`|5agXk9ldaa	i think the prob;em is from you dear.<br>  i am white but i think you are choosing wrong people that is all, try to know the person before sleeping with him|`|q9bq625Kaa	It is not all black men.

He remembered how he just said a few words to you and you nearly fell in love with him.  He though to himself "Oh No, now she's going to obsess about my friend.  Look at her staring at him.  Oh No, now she's staring at me and I can't look away.  Now she's going to obsess about me AGAIN!!!"   That's probably what happened.

7e4jxj3Daa	I find it extremely sexy and a turn on myself.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Yes! I like shy girls, because I hate the loud annoying ones.

So the shy scene can take in, but remember that sometimes the completely shy person doesnt get anyone and guys think that she just wants to be left alone and keep themselves to themselves. Try simple things like not crossing your arms when you are out and about and give as much eye contact as you can without looking like you are staring. <br>  Shy people are the best cause they are more approachable to talk to for guys and in the end they would rather take home a sweet attentive girl to their parents then an in-your-face girl<br>  Hope this helps|`|PEqLbirmaa	I say yes because I am extremely shy myself.

It shouldn't really matter if a girl is shy or not as long as you like the person you get when she shows her personality.|`|5JiNIcGSaa	the smae case is with me.its just that you need your time to be comfortable with someone.so what.believe me guys like that simplicity.i am going around with a guy and had the same feeling intially.i am cool now.i can talk anything now.go ahead,take you time.|`|QareyZKfaa	Simply put... some do, some don't.  You can generalize for men about as much as you can for women... there are PLENTY of grey shades among the black and white.|`|QHN2K7SVaa	yes, i like gals how r shy..... well but i dont think so tat you r shy girl....|`|DTZmqnCkaa	If they are hot they do.

Idk, Id go with, tie up your loose ends...dont throw love away cuz you're scared of what might happen if you leave.....<br>  <br>  worst case scenario...just have a long distance relationship, if he wants to go and you dont, I mean its hard but if you love each other ... >.>|`|ulW7G8nPaa	If you have a plan and the money I would say why not....It's an experience to remember.  Relationships are about give and take you know compromise; I'm an Aries so I know all about being stubborn, but just for the record when you go you should let your boyfriend know and you should remember that you shouldn't try to use love to get you significant other to do something you want them to do.  I still say go for it though.|`|dJoE8yedaa	You are still young and if he's giving you an opportunity to see another part of the world, why not take it. If you do go and don't like it, you could still go back home. It's not like you'll be imprisoned there. Look at the glass as half full. Tell him it will only be a trial thing as compromise is good in a relationship.|`|FzFSzilmaa	nothing wrong with either of you... you want what you want, he wants what he wants... and a year in australia is a once-in-a-lifetime thing... let him do it... or he'll always resent the fact he couldn't do it...<br>  <br>  perhaps you should break up until you are both on the same page again...|`|i5MxtGENaa	ok... its a big commitment, and im wanting to travel soon and id hope my partner would be willing to support me as i would for her. if you went away your gaining a life experience, and your getting the life you want as soon as you get back...i would go for it|`|GYwLGjt2aa	i dont think you are. it sounds like he does love you. ehy? dont you want too go. i mean i understand why? you dont want to leave. but why? not go with him  and visit. you might like it. and for ur man. girl dnt let say that to you, if he truley loves and has deeo feelings for you. then he should be more understanding.aand not say well if you love me ur go. that was wrong for him to put it like thaat.hope everything works out for you. peace|`|d5f3e65ac4895a16eeeeaa09b2857623aa	I think you should go with him. Its just a year. And it might turn out the best thing you've ever done. You never know. Go there instead of regretting that you never went. You'll be going back anyways. ;)|`|DcbM4S4Uaa	Hun, neither of you are right or wrong, you both are in a position that you dont want to be in cause i bet that he doesnt want to leave without you and that is why he is being persistent. <br>  It is up to you really, i will not try and convince you one way or another, but it is a once in a life time oppotunity to go there for a year and get some amazing experience. Talk to your parents and try and see what they would think cause you can still stay in contact with them. <br>  But he shouldnt try and force you into it, if you dont feel comfortable with it then dont go or it isnt a good time for you. And sometimes long distance relationships can work. <br>  <br>  Tell him that you understand that he wants to go, that you would like to go as well but for less time cause you will really be upset if you have to leave your family. You dont want to loose him over something like this and that you really want to sit down and talk to him properly about the whole thing, you might be able to come to some sort of decision between both of you. <br>  Hope this helps|`|QareyZKfaa	Ok.  This might be difficult to.. um.. read?  <br>  <br>  You BOTH have to do what feels right to you.  If you don't want to go to Australia, then so be it.  But if he feels it's right for him, then you really can't stop him.  <br>  <br>  If you were to go with him and drop everything, for example, you might regret that decision for a long time after.  The same, however, goes for him.  If he feels it's right to go but doesn't, he could regret that too.  So no more of the "If you loved me, you'd go" or "If you loved me, you'd stay.."  <br>  <br>  If you love each other, then you'll let the other do what feels right to them... even if you sacrifice your own happiness to do it.
HvbIE03saa	If you're not really that into him in the first place but your friend is, and you risk the chance of losing your friendship, then tell him this (nicely). Let him know that while you appreciate how he feels, you don't necessarily feel the same way. You don't have to tell him how your friend feels, but you could always nudge him in her direction. <br>  <br>  If you want, you can also tell your friend what's going on, but that depends on how you think she's going to react.|`|DcbM4S4Uaa	If you dont really talk to him in school/at all and you dont think that it would be comfortable going out with him then dont feel like you have to do it cause he asked you! <br>  However, if you like him then talk to your best friend and tell her that you like him and want to go out with him but you dont want to hurt/loose her in the process. <br>  Hope this helps|`|vcxzt3R6aa	It depends how much she likes him. That happened to me and the guy asked me out instead of her and I asked her multiple times if she cared and she said no but needless to say we aren't friends anymore. but she could just get over it and if she cared about you she would let you be with him and not make it akward.|`|Af6e3RUOaa	don't say yes becasue you dont really "like" him <br>  let your friend have a chance with him cos she likes him<br>  you could risk losing you BEST friend over some guy you dont like that much <br>  good luck x|`|cB1Hyxhvaa	Do you like the guy? <br>  <br>  If i were in your shoes, i would choose my best friend than the guy.

ymWkGqm7aa	I'm quite shy too. In group discussions, just make sure you know what you're talking about and no-one will have a reason to make fun of you. When you know you're going to be in a crowd, try to think of reasons why you should be nervous in a crowd, and be more positive. For example, if you think people will laugh at you, well why on earth would they laugh at you? If you think you're going to fall over on the dancefloor, just avoid the dancefloor.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Start speaking up. The more you talk the more comfortable you'll be with it.

kbkbDhwLaa	Look up the actual techniques you need to use. For instance instead of saying "Making a picture seem old", call it weathering or aging. For adding items, say something like superimposing. It will make it sound more believable and more professional. Also, for the last line, don't use frame twice. They know you're talking about the frame when you mention it the first time.

HvbIE03saa	You only dated for 2 weeks and you think you're in love with her?<br>  <br>  First of all, someone getting pissed over your myspace status is so friggin lame, that's like someone getting mad at you because they're only your number 3 friend and not your number 1 friend.<br>  <br>  If she is still hanging around you and being lovey dovey and you still have feelings for her, then have a serious talk with her. Talk with her about what happened in the past and what could happen in the future. Tell her you still have feelings for her and ask her what she feels. If she says she has feelings for you, then start going out on dates, taking it slowly and see where things go.<br>  <br>  If she says no, she just likes being your friend, then you need to tell her to back off, because you can't get past her and move on with your life when she is throwing you signals left and right that leave you hoping for the possibility of a reconciliation. <br>  <br>  Seriously though, the best thing you can do is talk it over.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|djUMvICoaa	You're young and a first kiss is always going to be something to be remembered and it should be.  What all else happens is kind of normal things for everybody, we have friends who come and go.  She went.  But a year later she saw you again and let you know you have a warm place in her heart and she was happy to see you.  Even if you don't go out with her she can make a great friend.  In the game of love there isn't much that makes sense.. until you find the right one and she says yes!|`|BLFduvnpaa	She seems to be unsure of her feelings towards you and she could possibly break your heart again.<br>  Moreover, she was already not there for you once and if I were you, I wouldn't trust someone like that. Especially since it was a critical period of time.<br>  <br>  Try going out with other people and bring yourself to get over her because although she was your first kiss, she seems unstable (not mentally but in a way that she just can't be there for you) and I'm sure you deserve someone better than that to be by your side and stuff.|`|jrdtQi04aa	She is a fair weather friend.  If you could not count on this woman to be there when you were going through such a terrible time, I wouldnt trust her this time either.  She may have been your first kiss, and she may have been your first love, but she isnt very loving.  I wouldnt deal with her.  You sound as if you really just want to know why she did this to you when your father was so ill, and I think you should just come out and ask her what kind of person she is, and what does she expect from you.  I think that she knows that she still has you, and maybe you could have had some miscommunication when you changed your myspace back to single.  You need to question her and her motives and get this out in the open.  That way, you can make an informed decision as to whether this woman should be in your life.  You sound like a decent guy, and there are probably lots of girls who would love to have you, and they would be good to you.  You deserve someone who will be there for you, through it all.  Good and bad times.

okh3hL8taa	So, what is this child's FATHER doing about the problem?  Your "partner" isn't supporting you in this if he isn't disciplining HIS child and is allowing her to behave this way.  You need to tell him to grow some balls as well as a backbone and start disciplining his daughter otherwise your child is going to behave exactly like her as it grows up because he isn't going to be supporting you in raising that one as well.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	I ran into the same situation when I started dating my now wife. her son was disrespectful and she didn't do anything about it, and the one thing that I cannot stand is a badly behaved child.<br>  <br>  I sat her down and explained my issues and that I would not maintain a relationship with her unless she started doing something about her son. After a few weeks of trying to get him in line, she decided to ask me for help and I readily gave it.<br>  <br>  After about 2 weeks of heavy discipline he started to improve greatly. You see, the main problem was that he had never had his behind spanked...fixed all the issues.|`|fN1zZpI1aa	get a tape recorder or maybe talk to her. sounds like the devil, sry but it's true.|`|d1P05XfPaa	It's your husband fault! <br>  You should tell your husband!<br>  She's only 6 yrs. old why bother?<br>  Don't be so desperate!|`|9dqG2ZSRaa	why are you telling me this you know what to do your momma did it to you just do it|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	I would talk to her father and suggest this: At six, it doesn't take long for a child to get the point. Send her home to her mother for a week, and tell her if she isn't going to be nice, she doesn't get to come visit at the house any more. Her father will object because he doesn't want to miss his time with her, but he won't have to. She will learn very quickly if you explain it to her right that if she wants to come to your house she has to treat you with respect. Then, the next time she is supposed to be with her dad, have him take her someplace and spend time with her, but not bring her to the house. She will want to know why. Her father will need to very politely explain that she can't be there right now because when she is rude, it upsets you, and when you are pregnant you shouldn't be upset. He should tell her that she is welcome at the house when she can be respectful, but until then she will have to see her dad somewhere else. I would be willing to bet it would only take once before she got herself in check. Especially if he takes her someplace boring, with yucky grownup food. Give it a shot, I'll bet it works very quickly.|`|e007e05ab25dccda0b479bc2d6289645aa	Ignore the first two answers -_-<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that she is only 6, firstly.<br>  <br>  My parents are long time divorced and I have two younger sisters. They seperated when I was about 11 and I am now 19 this year. <br>  <br>  After a year from the seperation, my father started seeing other women. They were ok and all but we didnt like it. There was one particular woman who tried really hard to get us to like her. She put alot of effort into cooking things she tot we'd like and was always nice to us. <br>  We were only 12, 10, and 7. We didnt like that our mother was replaced regardless of who was wrong. We were mean to her and barely ate. Made a mess and refused to talk. <br>  <br>  you are worried about a 6 year old ruining your life? She is worried you will ruin theirs. What happened with her mother? Mayb the little girl is afraid of history repeating, and the pain returning. Alot of divorced kids just dont like to see their father or mother being replaced. Or mayb she's afraid she's being replaced. A child's mind is hard to predict.<br>  <br>  disciplining her is not the solution<br>  <br>  Get your husband to talk to her, just be nice and talk to her, explain away any worries she may hav. He needs to show her that he is there for her so that she will have at least one refuge. <br>  This will make it easier for you. Let her see that she still matters to him and so do you.<br>  <br>  Be nice to her and endure. Even if she says she hates you, tell her you love her. Tell her you are not trying to replace her mum and mayb she could show you how to do things as 'well' as her mum. Show her that you are not a REPLACEMENT only a CHANGE. Over time, she should come around<br>  Treat her like ur own daughter and tell your children to accept her as their sister even if she is a meanie most of the time<br>  The only way to improve things is to bond as a family<br>  <br>  DO NOT make the mistake of trying to discipline her. It's like trying to win over a dog by hitting it repeatedly... -_-<br>  She is a child. She needs love and support|`|drEfr9waaa	It might help for her dad to have a chat to her.  If he's already done it, he needs to do it again.  If she keeps it up -being disrespectful - I'd discipline her. She has no respect for your position in the family and this has to change.|`|a64e450ba07c8847d95f73cf740e6a92aa	tell your husband about what is happening to you, tell him that this is difficult for you and that you are pregnant so you need his help.|`|eEbqfYUTaa	youre pregnant so take care of yourself. dont mind what he would say. anyway shes still young and immature.|`|5snO0Yngaa	You sound like a very sweet lady, you have been very patient and kind to this child, however you are not getting the same in return.<br>  I often think that 6 year olds are too young to really understand the impact of their actions. This child seems to be acting 'extreme' in a situation that is not required. Obviously the result of being immature. How can she be accountable for her actions, when she really probably does not understand what she really is doing. Chidlren at the age of 6 are not nasty naturally, they have to be taught this, I believe if they do show forms of nastiness, it is usually because they are copying the behaviour of an adult......could she be copying her real mother's behaviour? I would assume that her mother does not really like you much and that this little girl is being loyal to her mother's feelings about you. Would you say this is right?<br>  Unfortunately, it can be hard to get through to a child that is not with you on a full-time basis and most of the child's influence is from the parent that she lives with on a full-time basis.<br>  Perhaps suggest counselling for this child. Talk to your partner about this. For a child to carry any amount of anger at a young age will only grow up and the anger will be exhibited in other ways, such as with abusive substances, etc. This child needs to see a psychologist, to sort out why she is angry. Ask your husband for support to get this for your step daughter.<br>  You have already analysed the situation you are in. You love the man you are with. You have a good life and have lovely children. All is well. Except when this angry child enters into your home.<br>  The best way to handle your step-daughter is by not giving this behaviour attention,  and make sure that the child understands that you are still happy and content whether she acts like this or not. No matter if she calls you names or says these things tell her that your life is happy and content and it makes no difference.<br>  Sit her down and say to her "I know that I am not your real mother, that is ok, I don't want to take the place of your mother, you already have one! And she is a lovely mummy, and I know that you want to come over only to see your daddy, well, that is fine by me, I think that you should spend lots of time with him, he loves you very much, but if you are going to be upset with me, well, I hope that you can see that I am a lovely lady, and see that we can be friends." Put the thing back onto her shoulders. Show her happy positive thoughts and words.<br>  I was married to a guy who had two children from a previous marriage and I went through all sorts of obstacles with these children.<br>  One of the children, a little girl, called madison, was always having temper tantrems, for no reason at all, she was a very unhappy child, always sick, always unhappy, always teary about the slightest things! and overly demanding for her father's attention when she came over! The way that I handled this is that I allowed her to have that special attention from her dad, I did not get in the way, I stepped aside when  her dad came over. (I think you are doing this with your step daughter.) However, when my partner used to go out, and Madison played up, I gave her boundaries. I told her that the lounge room was a happy place, and that if she wanted to have a temper tandrem, that it was fine to express her anger and yell,  but she would have to do it in the bedroom, and I would lead her into the  bedroom to do her thing. It is important to say this to the child in a kind and soothing manner. Do not use a tone that is stressed or angry. Usually Madusib did not last in the bedroom and would come out to join the other children and have fun in the lounge room. She did not like the isolation. We ignored her negative behaviour and put it in the other room. But I did this in a nice kind way. I gave her permission to act this way. But I told her where she was allowed to do this in my home. But if she was bad tempered again, I reminded her that it was ok, but the bad temper room was in the bedroom. You  must gently take her hand and lead her into the room. If she resists, then must patiently wait next to her and say, "does this mean you have finished being angry?" Maybe she will change her mind instantly and not want to go to the bedroom. This is the house rules. Ask your husband to go along with this when he is at home. This allows the child to feel that she is not rejected about how she is feeling (sad that her dad and mummy live apart) and she may get over this alot quicker than you think.<br>  The tiring thing I found - when looking after my ex's children - is that every time they came over, I had to re-remind them of the boundaries. Somehow, they would go "backwards" when at their mother's place.<br>  Yes, it is a continual  situation that you  need to keep on top of and it takes effort and patience.<br>  But remember, children grow up.<br>  I would be more concerned about this behaviour  being displayed in front of your own childr
NAwWqDMAaa	dont be scared of him, thats what he wants.<br>  get to your parents before he does they have a right to no. tell them the truth then you have nothing to worry about if he blabs to them becayse they will aready no :) good luck x|`|zAoKd2DBaa	Go to the Police. Tell them you are being blackmailed and harassed but that you want this kept confidential and your parents mustn't find out. <br>  <br>  Doesn't it go to show you that your parents were right about him though ! ? <br>  <br>  I'm sure your worries about your parents finding out are unfounded - they'd much rather you tell them now than carry on being blackmailed.|`|5wVeLrXuaa	The first thing you must do is tell your parents. Then it will all fall into place. Yes they will be angry but this is the only way out and save yourself from this. He might be one of those dudes that end up being all controlling and want to hurt you. You need you mom & dad right now!|`|q8Sjyz1aaa	tell your parents, just say look i have been seeing him for a good few months because i enjoyed being with him etc etc etc. and say that your sorry but you really fell for him and you couldnt help the way you felt, you cant control the way you feel, and they cant control it either but make sure you say that you never had sex with him again, and im sure your fella wont say anything anyway hes just blackmailing u. or tell him go on then ive already told them anyway|`|e007e05ab25dccda0b479bc2d6289645aa	Well, you could try calling his bluff...<br>  <br>  Tell him you don't care if he does tell your parents and you'll accept the consequences if it means getting rid of him.<br>  <br>  Tell him u know they will b mad at you if he tells them but they will help you break away from him once they know. Also, if your parents know, you could even go to the police and take a restraining order against him.<br>  <br>  Dare him to tell ur parents. Tell him he has more to lose by telling ur parents than u do. Worst case senario for u is you get into **** alot of trouble. But for him, you could go with your parents to report him. <br>  <br>  You gotta act really confident so he'll believe you. If he suspects you are still scared of letting ur parents know than you lose. So make sure u do a damn good piece of acting|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	just tell your parents|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	First of all don't buy into the whole he's going to tell your parents drama, how would he have access to them? And How old is he and how old are you? If he tells your parents he might just have some very pissed parents on his hands especially after he gives them this kind of information, which could be his own demise! And one more thing, Don't let him in the house if you don't want him there, you have control over that situation and if he persist then call the cops to have him removed from the yard (You stay in control of the blackmailer) this will only look favorable from your parents point.  You made a mistake (no biggy) but the point to this whole story is you learned what the reasons were that your parents didn't want you to see him in the first place.  Don't answer the phone when he calls, again you have control over that situation also, let your parents pick up the phone and if he is on the other end they will stop the phone calls.  What do you think your parents will do when they find out he is harassing you and trying to control their daughter in such a way, Uh I think they will focus the majority of their attention towards his blackmail and intruding in their home and making you feel uncomfortable and controlling you!  Stop trying to find an easy way out! There is NO easy way out of this situation! Sorry!<br>  <br>  <br>  PS if you start letting your mistakes rule your future (which you are) now, Then what will you allow next just not to get in trouble with your parents.... your safety? This is a risky lifestyle and will sooner or later cause you a whole lot trouble which will make todays situation seem like easy street!|`|OOwUlO4Jaa	Don't be chained down, it is best to be open with your parents, they might not like what you say but they will be there to help you and you can be rid of this control freak. your parents will be impressed that you have told them, this will show great character and although they may well be upset they will respect you more. at the end of the day its your parents that love you, will help you and guide you through this time of trouble. be strong and great luck.|`|tGfWbGcgaa	i think you should tell this boy that u need a breake from him cuz it's not working and you can't keep lien and even if he trs to tell your parents jus deal with it cus if you really want him out of your life you wouldnt care about getting in trouble you feel me|`|PltDCZljaa	Yeah, when we have been blackmailed we have hired some drug crazed bikies to do them over, worked a treat, only pay half the fee up front though...|`|2F1TJuYfaa	hit him over the head with a shovel then bury him in the garden

I think what you said about getting his leg over and having somewhere warm to sleep off his hangover is more or less the truth. Learn from your mistake. Most guys don't want to start a relationship, or even go on a date, with someone who puts out on the first meeting. Its common knowledge. Theres nothing wrong with it though, if its what the woman wants too, knowing that its going to be a "once-off" occasion.|`|fed691c75c2fe4f571cb7590f44c77b8aa	No , waite for more time maybe something had happend to him ,,,|`|4KCaSuAlaa	its gonna work out, you dont know his situation, he prolly will|`|w1iHxDL1aa	Just keep your cool and wait out.

3a7cc492443eeeac6f0d36cf9e09ec8daa	Ok, even though I'm 24... I can vividly remember when I used to have emotions as strong as yours. So I'll give you the advice I would wish I could have had when I was your age.<br>  <br>  You're a man. She means the world to you but you have to stand tall first before you can do anything. You can't be an emotional wreck because when she needs someone to lean on, she doesn't need that person to topple over with her. So suck it up, take a deep breath and, at the very least, act like it is all good.<br>  <br>  Now, she knows how you feel. But she has a man, so go on with your life and if she wants to be in it fine. But if not, then focus on other things and keep yourself occupied. The best piece of advice I can give someone your age is... you can't convince someone to feel or act a way towards you by logic and arguement... it has to be by emotion.<br>  <br>  <br>  So scenario #1: <br>  <br>  You pour your aching heart to her in hopes that she leaves her boyfriend. She'll probably need someone who makes her feel like a million bucks, but she'll still be attracted to her bf... so you'll be stuck as the mistress.<br>  <br>  Scenario #2: <br>  <br>  You brush it off, you go about your life... being the best you can be, in sports... school... friends and parties and trust me she'll be always gazing your way wondering what she let go of. Then I swear to you, she will come to talk to you because she's excited by you. <br>  <br>  <br>  Never do emotional with a girl, they never like it. Sure tell them how you feel and maybe let them see you weak once or twice.. but never be too emo... it's unattractive and it makes women think you're a push over. <br>  <br>  You learn this now... and college will be the best experience of your life.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	what can you do if she is with another?  you are not being fair to yourself by loving someone who isnt free to love you in return.  you deserve more than that.  some girl is looking for you and wants all those beautiful love letters and she is dreaming of you right now!!  why did you waste your time on this girl??? huh? why??!!!!  dummy!|`|6w8jfI7Uaa	OMG..

Hopefully you can get to the bottom of it all.|`|B7mzzhZ5aa	i feel sorry for you but maybe your blinded by what you think is love? you have to ask yourself is this girl really that great that she would lead me on when she has a boyfriend. the thing is you cant get involved with someone when there in a relationship or things will get messy. maybe your a bit clingy with this girl? that can be off putting. stand back for a while she'll come crawling back when they break up. pretend you dont care and she'll realise how close you really were.|`|PSI3Y4Tbaa	Ouch i fell for you that's got to hurt. You have to take time and think what are you getting out of loving her other than being hurt? You need to be selfish and stay away from her and try and get her out your system as she is with someone it'll be hard but you have to do whats best for you and not be around her till you heal and can deal with being just friends if that's what she wants. Maybe if the timing was different and she was single you guys could be together and if its meant to be it'll happen eventually trust me!

I fought for my son and it was the hardest thing I ever did.|`|hLosmqqGaa	Unless the father is an unfit parent, he cannot be denied his parental rights, which includes seeing his children.<br>  <br>  For full custody, normally you would need to demonstrate that the children's current situation is detrimental, the kids want to be with the parent they are not currently living with, and that parent is in at least as good as, if not a better position to care for the children.<br>  <br>  Judges are often sympathetic to mothers, but that goes out the window if she is unfit to care for the children. They will hear testimony from the children as long as it's appropriate, and they don't like to see children that have been coached. I know in New York State, once a child is 15, it is their choice which parent they would like to live with, the parents have no say unless, again, one parent has shown allegations of unfitness likely to be true.

sRsGTgqIaa	When that time comes there wont be anything that you can do about it, so you may as well be a good sport about it. Think about the times that you had with your dad and the times that this child hasn't had.  Also, he will be a older brother to the child that you might have.  This is good also. It might be easier than you think to learn to really care for this kid. He's probably nervous too.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	you just have to realize that this child came before your relationship with him (hopefully), and get to know the child before judging them on their mother. if you can't handle seeing the child let your husband know that if/when he sees him that you don't want to be involved.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	First, accept that your husband has the right to be both curious about his child, and involved in his life.<br>  <br>  Your fear is based on the idea that someone has a previous claim on his affection and attention---and some women don't get the whole "connection" deal. <br>  <br>  Stop equating the child with its mother.<br>  <br>  If you can't get a handle on this, you will be driving a permanent wedge between you and your husband that nothing will fix.|`|e7302da69a66d35643b221f8f86ec06daa	Did you and your husband have conversations about this before?  If so what did he say about the possibility of having contact with the child?  If you had an understanding that the child was not going to be a part of "your" (you and your husbands) life then you have a foundation for telling him that you're not going to be comfortable having him around.  And you can tell him why.  Afterall, it may just be a ploy of his ex to get more attention.  If your husband wants to start having a more active role with his child perhaps he could do them outside your home at first and maybe slowly introduce more contact with you.  It's not the kids fault who his mother is, try to focus on the parts of him that are your husbands.  You know what I mean.  Work on it, but don't be afraid to tell him how you feel and what your needs are.|`|FzFSzilmaa	you could try growing up...<br>  <br>  stop referring to the child as THE KID...<br>  <br>  he should want to be in the childs life and helping them to be the best person they can... and you should support him... unless you are too bitter and insecure to do that... and are happy to make an innocent feel unwanted or unloved...|`|dU4IPBO0aa	Well, in order to really love someone and be in love with them, you have to love every part of them.  If you cant love his son, then maybe you should step back and take a look at how much you really love your husband.|`|dWLGK7nlaa	Did the child come before or after you came into the picture?  This is hard, but you have to take each day at a time. Sometimes things we worry about never happen. GOOD LUCK!|`|UOLj2jldaa	You can not allow a bitterness you fill towards the child's mother to interfere with what could be a rewarding relationship between your husband and yourself and mostly the child.You have to consider the future and what decision you make now regarding this child and its effects later. Help make this child's life rewarding not only for yourself but for you as well. Ask your what if this was turned around and your husband was asking the same question.|`|AA11630994	If i was in your place id have felt the same. Especially if this child was concieved while i was married. In that case i would never be able to accept the child. If it was before we knew each other, then it would be easier. <br>  Its not the childs fault, but unfortunately, he is a reminder of his mum and ur hubby.|`|ccM9uNcWaa	Try to block out the fact that he has had one with another woman.<br>  It works for my parents.<br>  My mam isn't bothered, as long as he was honest towards it.<br>  He said it was before they had met.<br>  Just try to image that he isn't the spawn of your husband and another woman.<br>  Image he is a friend of a son/daughter.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck.|`|a0024a8805bd3c2a385199e722566faeaa	Look at it from the worst point of view.  Can you tell your husband, "I want a divorce because I can't love your child"?  <br>  <br>  Think about it...say it out loud a few times.<br>  <br>  If you can say the words and mean them...then you need to leave now, because that child will always be his whether you're there or not.
AA11630994	Because a broken home really makes them feel scared, abondoned and unloved.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Sometimes because they figure a woman is weaker than a man.<br>  <br>  Sometimes because they are manipulative, and they know a mother's heart is softer at times.<br>  <br>  The point is, it shouldn't be allowed. If my child spoke rudely to me - he's a boy, age 13, - I would not permit him to continue with this attitude, and I also would inform my ex-husband about it, so he can deal with him....as a young man, not as a child anymore.|`|FzFSzilmaa	cos they are angry and upset and can't deal with parents who fight and are mean to each other...|`|ab97da113204f1133543ea4510872e26aa	unfortunatley generations have changed so much, its had to keep up with it , i go thru alot of the same stuff, they think because their father is not around that they can use it as an excuse to carry on these days try to take advantage of anything they can, and make us feel guilty for what ever they please, i am a single parent of 2 boys one of them is 14 and a half, and is almost 6 foot tall i tell you its a challenge somtimes as i am only 5 foot 3 inches tall ,stay strong thats all you can do at present|`|8gCJVFG3aa	Kids Dont Always Ignore The Mother. <br>  I Spose Its Just, Having Someone To Blame For The Divorce. <br>  They Must Feel Slightlyy Upset About It And Feel That They Need Someone To Blame.<br>  As My Parents Are Divorced, I Kindah Know From Experience.<br>  Im Alwayss Freaking Out On My Mum And Calling Her Names And Back Answering And I Dont Even Know Why.<br>  I Have Recently Noticed That I Have A Short Temper And I Dont Even Know Why.<br>  Divoce Isnt Reeli A Nice Thing For Kids To Have To Face As A Part Of Everyday Life And Knowing That They Can Answer YOu back And Ignore You Shows That There Obviously Blaming You For The Divorce.

If you ever try to make somebody like you by constantly giving gifts,asking to come over to their house etc. they will just think of you as an annoying person, eventually.  Yeah occasionally it is good to go to each others house (otherwise you won't know that person good enough to be a good friend) but don't stay to long mabey on hour or two.  But don't be consistent with going to each others house unless the other person invites you.<br>  But I know what you mean by not controlling other  peoples happiness,  it's their responsibility to want to like you or others, they control their own happiness|`|EMYlCPfuaa	you are so inextricably Right!!! happiness begins within! change begins from within! no one person can make antoher happy - if someone wants to be happy they must be able to do that for themselves!!! when they meet someone else who is happy, then as you say this is a bonus! and two happy peopole together are very blissful to behold and tobe around! no one can make you happy - only you can do that for yourself!!! a good portion of us learn taht early on in life... sometimes we become side tracked and/but always know deep inside of us that we are the makers of our own happiness and our own destinies! ily!|`|YBIiEF3Paa	You are right, happiness comes from the inside first and foremost.

If that doesn't work, I think you should get together with her boyfriend and give him some advice on how to make her feel beautiful... like, buy her flowers and tell him to write her some nice love letters telling her she is the only girl that he would ever want to be with.

You'll think you have falling out of love but hang in there because it's only a phase just one of many that all marriages go through. Just knowing something that small could save your marriage. You be surprise just how many couples think when they get married the lust and love you feel for each other stays with you automatically. Your supposed to feel that way forever sorry to disappoint you but it doesn't work that way. You really have to work to keep that feeling alive. I can't tell you how many times i thought i no longer loved my husband but a day or a month later my love was back even deeper then before. Your love gets buried under day to day mundane things and before you know it your wondering what happened. Communication is the answer .|`|yd2SP7d6aa	It takes work & effort to keep a marriage strong.  I'd also recommend being truthful in all things as even the small things have a tendency to blow up in your face and it simply sucks trying to keep a lie going (adds additional stress that doesn't need to be present).<br>  <br>  Most people make marriage to be incredibly difficult, it isn't unless your an idiot or you had no business getting married in the first place (either picking a bad spouse or because you have some big faults that add stress). If you really enjoy hanging with the guys / girls more than you do spending time with your spouse, don't get married.  If you are an addict (alcohol, porn, gambling etc.) don't get married (or if your significant other is).

Tell her that you know what she does and you need time to think.

AA11630994	You know...sometimes us women - we put too much thought in little things. And im beginning to learn this recently. Men don't realise we analyse every little thing so much.<br>  To answer your question - Yes...and no....Yes you may be over reacting - and no its not worth arguing with him about it. He probably doesn't realise he's doing that. <br>  I suggest when you feel like that just swallow and let the anger pass, talk to him when you're much more calm and in a better mood. My hubby used to do a lot of romantic things that used to take my breath away, now... 2 years later - i feel things have changed, but i see the smile on his face every morning, and the way he makes me tea - it may not be as romantic as getting a massage everyMorningg - or him trying to love me up as much as hecan beforee going to work - but i see his happiness in his eyes and his smile - and it shows me he's content and happy. And that could only mean im doingsomethingg right, and he's feeling something right in his heart. <br>  <br>  If things were changing so much, hewouldn'tt even try to get with you.<br>  So relax, let the mood swings pass, and enjoy being with him. The fact that you're living together does meanthingsg will become a little more tepid, but it wont mean your love will get any less.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	I think you are overreacting to the card and the whole hand-holding thing. maybe he was trying something different, and the card, most guys don't like getting the lovey-dovey cards, i was married for 7 years and I never got the real romantic ones, i got funny ones and wrote my own lovey-dovey letter to my wife. <br>  <br>  as far as him trying to pull your clothes off though, that was rather insensitive of him.|`|b9uOax0aaa	You are over reacting.  But that sort of thing happens when people shack up with each other.|`|Fc0ZR1hnaa	Yes, I think you are overreacting. You are both going to have to go through changes together now that you are officially living together. You both have to adjust. As far as the card that you got for Valentines day, be thankful that you even got one! The man that I was with for almost six years didn't get me anything, didn't even say anything. The truth is, I believe that was the weekend that he moved on with someone new. Be happy for what you got, so what if the card wasn't all mushy and romantic. Big deal! Sounds like you have a keeper there and you should start being more appreciative.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	You need to find a solution to your PMS problem. I suggest limiting caffeine, drinking lots of water, extra work outs, long bubble baths and  lots of sleep. You should also get him a gift. A small calendar so he can keep track of when your period is and when you'll be suffering from PMS. Let him know you're working on it and that he'll need to be aware of when it's coming......|`|UJD2eYebaa	Way over-analytical...if he only knew how you interpret his every gesture and read into things that are probably so misunderstood - think he would be afraid to walk across the room!  Just relax and look at the big picture: he moved you (& your 3 kids) in with him.  Think that speaks volumes right there.  Good luck & hope your hormonal upheaval subsides soon.|`|e7302da69a66d35643b221f8f86ec06daa	Yeah, the pms is making you crazy and making him miserable.  Go to the doctor and get your hormones checked.  It's very possible that you can get your levels evened out and you and your guy will be much happier for it.  And never stop a lovemaking session right in the middle because you spaz out about the way he's touching your hand!!!!  If he's laying on the bottom and flipping channels on the remote then you may have a case, but not because he held your hands in fists instead of interlocking fingers!!!!  You've got to be killing him.|`|6YlHOiGHaa	you do sound hormonal|`|PltDCZljaa	Is this a yahoo questions forum or a porn and boo hoo blog?????|`|R1zUIh7taa	Yes, you did overreact.  You may want to talk to your doctor about what happens to you when you PMS!  Good Luck!|`|w4RFqR9jaa	yes you are over reacting.|`|BRnYseFKaa	yes i think you did over react.<br>  you seem very emotional and well im not sure why. just because he didnt interlock his fingers with yours does not mean he doesnt love you as much.<br>  just because he didnt comfort you the way he normally does doesnt mean he doesnt love you as much.<br>  <br>  personally i think hes more comfortable around you now that youve moved in together and are closer, so he feels like he doesnt need to do some of the things he used to do to show he loves you. you should just know.<br>  <br>  relax and just stop taking him for granted. organise a day out at the park or something, just you and him. someone simple and romantic and you will feel better :)|`|g9vw4ovGaa	OH honey, I know how it is, you're just reading too much in between the lines, men don't have lines, they don't need you to read into things. What they say is what they mean. I think you're being to big of a woman. No man is going to think well maybe I should hug her to make her feel better, they think ok, i'm gonna leave her alone for a little bit and let her air it out. If you don't think things are ok, then speak up, and not at a time where your PMSing. PMS doesn't make women over react, that's just women, maybe you should try some mood stabilizing medication. That's what I had to do, because every other day I would tell my hubby I wanted a divorce. Things aren't going to be the same after you move in together, he is in his space, where he is comfortable and going to let him self  be free to be who he is. The card, i'm sure he didn't think about it, he was trying to state "thank you for loving me even though I have many faults." Stop reading into every little thing he says, because more than likely, its nothing to be read.|`|ulW7G8nPaa	I think that you are totally overreacting.....about everything, and I'm not really sure why, I'm emotional when I PMS but I cry at movies and stupid stuff like that I don't over how my husband does or does not touch me or a card.  Don't take him for granted he loves you and your 3 girls don't run him away with your insecurities and all of the emotions.  Be feminine yes but be whinny no, go get that checked out for all of you.|`|znjl6WrWaa	Well it does sound like you might be overreacting a little. Did he get you cards that were more expressive in the past? If I were you I would just sit down and talk to him about it all (but not in an accusing way). Also sometimes men don't know what would make us feel better. You know maybe he honestly thought that making love to you would help you see that he still loved you. and about the whole fist instead of holding your hand thing...not to sound crude but maybe he was just trying to get a little rougher to change things up.|`|10114ae4ad291d214b18ee10bbfc8bfeaa	I get the same way you do..i pick up on "change" even unintentional change and make my own conclusions for the "change". I fall in such love with certain things my husband does (but I never tell him) and as soon as I noticed even 1 time that he did not do it I FREAK and think OMG we are drifting apart. I make a big deal out of it and he thinks Im crazy, lol. I think we are just getting really emotional. What I usually do to ensure things are ok is back off a bit from my husband and let him come to me emotionally and ask me whats wrong ect..then I know he cares and I can chill. I need constant reassurance or i feel like things are doomed especially around that time of the month. I'm not a mooshy-mooshy girl either but change makes me sooo insecure even if its that my husband didn't interlock his hands with mine. I dont know what to say but your not alone..I think its hormonal.

1cb3542838b379bb2f5a7c25c04d579baa	I am awfully sorry about what's happened.  You are a good son to want to help. <br>  <br>  Let your dad know you're there for him.  Call him a lot.  Do any of your father's friends/siblings know what's going on?  Maybe they could help, too.   When you get back, if you could afford to, go out with your dad, maybe to a restaurant or for a drink.  <br>  <br>  Call your brother.  Let him know you're there for him, too.  You could send him little presents, etc.  Reassure him that your mother walking out is not his fault, but don't say anything negative about her, either.  <br>  <br>  Don't feel responsible for your mother's actions.  It is her fault she ran out, not yours.  It is not your duty to have to pick up the mess she's made.  Love your family, and let them know you're there.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	he needs a lawyer to fight for custody and do you really know everything about the two of them and no you must lead your own life they are two adults and they will deal with what life has dealt them and stay close to your brother and love both of your parents no matter what|`|UMl7CBCIaa	Don't get to emotionally involved.<br>  there is a reason the is unknown to you.<br>  You Love your father and you love your mother.<br>  <br>  be there for your little brother.<br>  do things with him. ie movies, things he like to do, etc.|`|J9q8aEr7aa	Hi,<br>  What can i do to help my father? <br>  - call him regularly. of you have money you can sponsor him a holiday<br>  What can be done so this is not so traumatic for my 10 year old brother? <br>  -meet him, explain things to him but don't paint your mother as evil. he will decide it by himself. tell him that you are his best friend.<br>  Should I feel responsible in any way for not being there with them and being away carrying on with my life?<br>  -  no, you don't have to. that's the way life is. call them, talk to them. that's enough.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	Are you judging your mother too harshly? Just because the reason isn't apparent to you and your father does not necessarily mean that it isn't meaningful to your mum. It is very rare for these things to be completely one-sided. You and your brother of course have no responsibility in this whatsoever, and your job is to be there for him and remind him of that. Write to him, and encourage him to write to you to discuss his feelings, but whatever you do, don't tell him that your dad is right and your mum is wrong. You don't know that for sure, and there may be something that your mum was simply too polite to tell you. Both of your parents deserve happiness, and will find it better on their own than they will with your interference. Try hard not to judge, but to simply offer support. They will find their way through this. Remember parents were divorcing long before you came along, and ended up happy, so your own parents can handle this too.|`|e007e05ab25dccda0b479bc2d6289645aa	Firstly, there is usually more than meets the eye. I am a divorced kid myself and after more than 8 years, I find that until now, I still dont know the full story about what happened and its not for the lack of trying.<br>  <br>  Dont feel like its your fault. If it was completely your fault, they should have said something. But I doubt you had much of a role in this. My sister once asked me if it was her fault. As their children, there is a lot we "could have done". Be more obedient, work harder, bond more, etc. It is and always will be an issue between parents even if the reason they are fighting is us. It is THEIR fight. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is be there for ur bro and dad. Let ur dad noe that he has not lost everything and he still has u. Let ur bro noe that it isnt his fault and that u r there for them<br>  <br>  Dont make the mistake of freezing out ur mum. Approach (not confront!) her for an explanation. Just because your father lost a wife doesnt mean u hav to lose a mother. Being at war with her will also affect ur bro...<br>  <br>  So play nice and be a good, supportive son and brother|`|SpalD7Tsaa	Your dad seems like a good person not saying your mom isn't but just tell your dad that everything is going to be okay and he'll probaly be able to see your brother more often once this all gets straightened out!

I though it would be a guy playing a gameshow. I think your fine, he just wanted to see a movie w/ a friend.|`|AA10170420	we can tell you different scenarios. but you will only find out when you ask him. maybe you will see that its not a big deal|`|e488c78b0404e0d573309d30166d7451aa	Well to start, I think that this movie is not a romantic movie about love and stuff like that. To sell movies there is always a love story involved to make the movie more interesting and that′s it.<br>  You are bothered that he went to the movie with a girl and you would feel the same way if it was any other movie. <br>  I think that you should really assume that he can go to the cinema with whom he likes, because he is not your property. And it seems that he did not make any secret about the fact that he went to the movie with that girl. If he would have something different in mind than just a friendship he would have not gone to a movie where everybody can see him and tell you about it. <br>  And what if it is a ex? You can stay friends wit an ex when you are through love and passion and good and bad feelings. And if there remains a good friendship it is usually a very good one. Stop thinking silly things, because if she is am ex she is an ex for something... <br>  You should really start to value yourself a little more and stop with that jealousy, because acting like this typical sort of woman who wants the time of her man 24 h only and exclusively for her and does suspect about each and every female shadow, will most probably lead to the failure of that relationship which you want to protect. <br>  Give him time and space to breath, honey. He is honest with you, so where is the problem???|`|YHmjpcdDaa	Well if he is your partner then he should have the respect to call you and ask if it is ok. This builds up trust and respect in a relationship.|`|jUS9ATdMaa	Why are you not going to the movie with him? Even in long distance relationship you must get together sometime.How would he feel if you went to a movie with a guy friend?|`|YsDwo7Dqaa	He is prob just a friend of hers, Long distance relationships are hard and the best thing to do is just trust this guy. <br>  <br>  Hope it all turns out.|`|C7vuoDpoaa	Hi<br>  <br>  i think it depends on how secure you are in your relationship.  How much you trust him plays a big part.  It is something i would be concerned with but it depends on how much of a big deal you want to make.  Guys hate insecurity but i also think you need to tell him how you feel.  Some guys only have female friends, maybe he prefers them to males.  <br>  I dont think he is playing games with you.  If he openly tells you about them then you have to either trust him or not trust him.  You really only have two options.<br>  If you think you can get over the other girls in his life then maybe its worth giving it a try if you really want to be with him.  If you dont think you can get over it and that it will always taint your relationship or cause fights then maybe it is best to move on.  However, what will you then do if the next guy has a similar situation.<br>  My partner has female friends.  At first i was a bit cautious of them, considering they had all been women he fancied or went out with but then i realised he wanted to be with me more so ive had to suck it in.  That and moving to another country has helped.<br>  You have to do what works for you, its about you, not him at the end of the day.  If its going to make you nothing than miserable you should move on or maybe get some sort of counselling to look at ways to deal with it.  I dont know,  im a pretty insecure person too but i realise that my man is worth the time and effort i put in.  He is extremely painful but the best part of my life.<br>  <br>  all the best<br>  <br>  regards<br>  Karina|`|NvNyOUMwaa	look, firslty don fight ok.<br>  now he needs to assure you more - n u need 2 stop worryin so much. i duno hw he treats u- but tht shld give u an idea- talk abt ur future plans- n see his reaction- tht shld give u a hint<br>  <br>  ans mine pl<br>  <a href="http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Au4tb1R5q3B1pWgRzGMNhfeQHQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090223025532AAkcaWy">http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>

Good luck...You are going to need it!|`|RmVSz5j2aa	Alot of women get completely turned off and turned away from their husbands when they look at naked women or the porn thing. I'm not sure if you are into porn,but I know if my husband started doing that, I would leave him no matter how much I love him. It is very degrading to a women and takes alot of their self respect away. So if that is what you were doing, then i'm sorry, but there might not be anything you can do. Me personally, there would be nothing my husband could do. because I know the way that I am. And what I will and wont put up with. And when it comes to intimacy, all the women can imagine is her husband and this other women, and what he's thinking about. So it really does ruin everything for a women that hates that kind of stuff and has alot of self respect.|`|kprKXEOSaa	Good for you, it's great you're trying to keep this together.  That's very important for the kids.<br>  It will take you a while to earn her trust again.  <br>  Do you laugh at her jokes?  Do you go and kiss her neck while she's making dinner?  Do you rub her feet?  Do you notice when she has cleaned the toilet?  Do you thank her for making sure you have clean socks?  <br>  There is nothing sexier than a man who is great with kids.  Do you fix things around the house?  That's very sexy too.  Don't make her nag you to get things done, when she asks you to change a lightbulb, do it right away.<br>  <br>  These are all things my husband does.  There are some days when he comes home, and I just think, oh I love him so much, he's so great with the kids, he works so hard, he's definitely getting some tonight.  But....by the time we go to bed, he's done or not done a few little things that have torqued me off, and that good feeling is gone.  You don't have to buy flowers to let her know you love her, even though flowers are nice.  It's all the little things you do, and your kindness and attitude.  It's kind of a point system, sad but true.  The sad thing is that one negative can wipe out all your points for the day.  <br>  <br>  If she's open to it, you could also get her the book "The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands" by Laura Schlessinger.  That book really made a difference in my marriage, but your wife would have to be open to the ideas in it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|oRzqWhsDaa	Its going to take a long time before thats ever happens you ruined whatever spark you had you misplaced her trust you hurt her really bad and now at least you are trying to make up for it and its just going to be time and healing process sadly it may never come back to her

No sense in beating your self up over something you van do nothing about. you both did your thing and the only thing you can do is trust her that it's over with the other guy.|`|dKLZvQyQaa	It is common to feel the way you're feeling now :)<br>  <br>  Your loved one has made a mistake and slept with someone, but that does not mean she will do it again. Trust is important in a relationship. You have to trust and believe her when she says she wants to be together with you again. Don't hold a grudge against her - she didn't do anything wrong since the both of you weren't together then and she was going out with another guy.|`|mVUpt8waaa	No you have no right to complain since you were also with MULTIPLE people.  Having said that, the best way to handle this asshole is to keep him close.  Invite him out, or over for dinner.  Become pals with him.  He will less lilkely try to make the moves on your girlfriend if he knows you.  You are not just a faceless "boyfriend".  But in the end if you cant trust your girlfriend enough to keep her hands off him, then the relationship is doomed.|`|LNTUfQGwaa	hey!! just ask her! tell her if she is really over with that guy! tell her to ignore that guy! believe me! it already happened to me! just ask her! and tell her that you wont leave her and that she's the only one for you! tell her that you trust her! and ask her if she will remain faithful to you and when she said her answer just say i love you and hug her gently and kiss her! be strong man! be strong! just ask her!|`|AA10997134	u both were with other people so u have no right to complain, however i can understand that u are uncomfortable with the situation, you should jsut tell her how u feel about it.  really u should feel priveleged cause she chose to be with u not him.|`|IfZHnE3Taa	try to make her change job!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hellas-fos.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://hellas-fos.blogspot.com/</a>

S2OZFct2aa	Hey girl!<br>  <br>  I think you should seriously sit down and talk with your friend and let her know that it bothers you that she still speaks affectionately about your boyfriend. Let her know that you're not trying to start any drama, but it really bothers you that she still flirts with your boyfriend even though she has a boyfriend, and she knows that this guy is obviously taken.<br>  <br>  You should also sit down with you boyfriend and let him know that you really care about him, and that you don't want to lose him. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!

Mas lo que la iglesia propone es esperar porque al hacer el amor antes del matrimonio se demuestra que no se ha podido esperar porque se desea demasiado a la otra persona, ya no se le ve como persona sino como fuente de deseo, como un objeto del que se necesita y al esperar pues puede uno afirmarse que ama a la otra persona más allá del deseo la pasión o las necesidades biológicas.|`|921720f54e506bd8884fddccb8b446cbaa	nunca.... es mejor desde el primer momento...|`|b992bb4a0d01e7379ffdb81a0ffb6d1baa	Definitivamente noooooooooo, creo que antes de casarse hay que conocerse bien en todo, más en el sexo, cuando uno se ama que tiene de malo el sexo? nada,  y al que dijo que si una queda embarazada y entonces tiene que casarse le digo que un hijo no obliga a nadie a casarse, un hijo exige que uno se ocupe de él pero no es casandose sino dándole amor, educación, bueno es largo, pero la respuesta es NO  FELIZ A?O|`|c60396809b3449fa65992f8794441ba2aa	La respuesta adecuada depende de la formación religiosa de las personas.<br>  Para los creyentes, es un dogma de fe, que es indiscutible y por lo tanto, ellos se tienen que mantener vírgenes hasta casarse.<br>  <br>  Los que creemos en la sociología, en la ciencia y el desarrollo humano comparado, no tenemos ninguna razón para esperar, ni para abstenernos. El sexo es divertido, gratificante, mejora el estado anímico y la salud general y además, contra la teoría invertida, de que hay que estar enamorado/a para tener sexo, yo respondo que es al revés.  Un buen entendimiento sexual, produce un sólido enamoramiento duradero.<br>  El casarse vírgenes, produce en la mayoría de los casos, matrimonios fracasados, infidelidades posteriores, reproches y amarguras mutuas.|`|c88a277346b0729ca8432fb072833412aa	si lo creo

009058e28e391a280bce506382496efaaa	Pues no estoy muy segura, depende de cuántos meses estemos hablando y de qué tanto conozcas a esa persona. El amor a primera vista es muy dudoso; una cosa es que te atraiga esa persona de primera vista, que con lo poco que la has tratado te alborote las hormonas y otra muy diferente que sea amor. Creo que depende en general de qué tanto conozcas a esa persona, todo: forma de ser, cacracter, inteligencia, cuando se enoja, cuando esta triste, su familia, sus gustos, intereses, etc, etc.. Si lo conoces en las buenas en las mlaas y las peores y aun así quieres estar con esa persona y das gracias porque existe.. entonces si puede ser amor. El enamoramiento si puede ser algo que se de con poco de conocerlo, que te emociona el verlo y sientes mariposas en la panza, mas aun no es seguro si es amor ( que es algo más maduro, estable, serio, formal, profundo).

It's ok to like somone younger.|`|9Sd0q01Zaa	Age aint nothin but a number|`|kAWXlwV5aa	No, that is not weird at all! As long as you are both at least 18 or both under the age of 18, it's fine. However, if you are less than 18 years old, you will turn 18 first and at that point it would then be illegal to have sexual intercourse with him. If your both over 18, go for it. Most experts recommend no more than 7 years of age difference in a romantic relationship. 3-4 years falls well within that range. It might be a fun experience, I would give it a shot!!|`|kIGZ0Qq0aa	Depend on your guys...but can say it would be weird as younger guys may not treat you the right way you want<br>  My guy was younger than me 6, we were so happy together but only for 3 months and broken up cuz weird reason...and I cant figured out why?

Obviously, there was something you were missing before getting involved with the co-worker.  With that being said, the least you owe your husband is the truth.  He deserves that much.  Right now, you are acting in a selfish way.  You wan't your cake, but you can't seem to cut away from the pie.  As far as you co-worker, he doesn't want to be the reason for the split.  He isn't going to open or say anything until you make a decision.  He may have feelings, but he isn't going to lay it out on the table.  Remember, it started off as a fling.  A big difference, and he may have feelings - but you are a married women.  Who isn't making a decision.  You also have the trust issue.  Why should he think that you would be true to him?  I am not judging at all.  i have first hand knowledge of these sticky situations - they are ugly.<br>  |`|WOFz8egwaa	ok im not going to judge you, i don't agree with cheating, but sometimes it happens, what you are doing is unfair to both parties, you need to make a decision who you want to be with and fix it. If you don't love your husband regardless of what you feel for this other man, then call it a day with him, no one deserves to be made a fool of.<br>  <br>  and as for this other man, before you throw away a marriage you really need to make sure you love him and he loves you. Whatever you decide, its only fair that you lose one of the guys, playing the field is ok if your single and hurting no one, but your married now. would you be ok if it was you being hurt by your husband?|`|fa70fc6c0ebd4df17b301a1c34d3c0b0aa	Ok i completely agree with the rest of the folks here but COME ON PEOPLE you rmissing the obvious!!!!<br>  <br>  Little miss tramp here is "...very in love with him..." does she really think this guy who is obviously trying to cope with his guilt going to trust this little immoral, guiltless, tramp? Of course not so feed her some of her own medicine...<br>  <br>  Sure honey, go ahead leave your husband that loves you, or at least did until he finds out, and go running to the office toy. he won't love you he might lust after you and play with you but you will never have am eaningful relationship until you stop being a tramp. besides what make you think this guy isn't doing to you what you are obviously doing to your husband.<br>  <br>  Sorry the added info does not help me it only confirms my thoughts. Now you want to add the he did this and this and this story.... Get help you both need it!|`|qzWBykzgaa	You need to focus on one relationship at a time! How can you possibly see your marriage for what it really is when you are consumed by these feelings for a NEW relationship? You made a vow to your husband "until DEATH do us part". Would you expect your relationship to be anything but rocky when you are cheating? Wow....
qUkAYB9laa	I dont have many answers just ideas....<br>  <br>  1. he really is worried th kids might hear<br>  2. he generally is tired<br>  3. he is depressed<br>  4. stressed?<br>  <br>  You need to communicate with him.

It is up to both of you to keep the passion alive. Ask what he needs to get more motivated...since that is what you need from him. Good love loving.|`|5FWGRnwRaa	Is a matter of communication here, let him know about this and i do agree on the oral sex part don't let him finish and tell him is your turn... |`|igObHHIdaa	Drop them off at a family members house or get a babysitter so he/she can keep the kids for the weekend.<br>  Then get busy. :)|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Geezo. I guess the honeymoon is over. You are going to have to set aside a date night. Get someone to watch the kids, have a nice dinner together and spend the evening alone. What else can you do? You have kids and they demand a lot of attention, there's work and the house, come on, this is reality.|`|a0cb768a2bcdc7a915356d5a5db75704aa	Keep doing that but don't let him finish, just stop and say my turn! Or get a sitter and have a date or a weekend away. I'd love it if my girl planned a weekend away from everything.|`|AA11990465	Thats very unusual. Maybe he has something on his mind. Have you tried to find out if there is something bothering him? Some men just don't like to open up and discuss things that are bothering them because they view it as a sign of weakness. |`|m4T0IT0yaa	Oh yeah...they are too tired to screw, but they're always up (no pun intended) for a f'ing bl*w j*b.

This means you get a babysitter and the two of you leave the house! Go to dinner and do something fun.<br>  <br>  You also should go on a weekend getaway together without the kids. If you pick a hotel and then go to their website you can usually pay extra for special packages. These packages can include champagne and cheese or Chocolate covered strawberries or candles and rose petals on the bed, or a romantic picnic lunch for two. You should get a sexy little something to wear.<br>  <br>  Find out what some of his fantasies are make them come true. A good one to try is for you both to meet at a bar and have him pick you up. You should arrive separtely and have a hotel room available near by.<br>  <br>  Some easy quick things you can do that will increase the romance would be:<br>  <br>  If you don't share a bathroom with the kids leave a love note on the bathroom mirror in lipstick. A sticky note works too but isn't as dramatic.<br>  <br>  Send him suggestive emails or texts throughout the day. This builds excitement and anticipation.<br>  <br>  Put a love note in his lunch box, brief case, or car.<br>  <br>  Send the kids to a neighbor and cook a special candle light dinner.|`|C0yagFFoaa	right. i would try and get away, leave the kids with family or frends, go to a nice place, in a hotel, maybe a spa, just the two of you, go for a few days. have time to unwind. this will give you time to get back together.<br>  if this is impossible, finance etc.. then try to initiate early in the morning,or just after work.<br>   tell him what you want, dont hold back, there must be times when the kids are away.<br>  when you are about the house, once in a while massage his feet. back. get him to enjoy this experience.<br>  make him associate massage with sex.<br>  knowing he will get a massage if he has sex with you.<br>  i know it sounds mad, but this is what i do with my wife.<br>  i find late at night is the worst time for me, as i am dog tired, but in the morning or after work, is good.<br>  good luck|`|e64c0ca0358d1542fe123074c9b6ce76aa	Something is seriously wrong here. Sit him down, talk to him about it. Find out what is going on. Maybe he's just stressed, or maybe he really is just too tired. But I doubt it. Never heard of a man turned down a BJ for sleep. Sit him down, and get him to talking. Something is really wrong. |`|UJaS53vOaa	Communicate your concerns to him, and ask him what you could do that would turn him on besides just oral sex.  Ask him what things specifically that you could do to get him in the mood.  Let his answers guide you to a much more satisfying place for both of you.|`|0e4387b2094405dfc19dbc597cf0998aaa	Let him sleep ahead of you  like 3 hours.Then go slowly to him by that time he already relax and hope it will ignite the passion.|`|JWVZc4rnaa	Send them to their Grandmas or somewhere right when he is about to get home from work. Get him all worked up then stop & he should want it back. |`|XMeNLuBfaa	the problem isnt communication its that he doesnt wanna have sex with u anymore|`|bd0e62f6649334b0dc67af506ebd7128aa	Call me at 555-1675|`|I4Xc9oBsaa	give me a call

EHujGe5Oaa	Once he moved to Los Angeles, he took a number of odd jobs, ranging from chauffeuring,[11] being a delivery man,[6] selling cigarettes,[6] assisting a soap opera writer,[6] and dressing up as an El Pollo Loco chicken, to pay for his acting classes.[1][6] When asked about the pivotal influence in his decision in leaving Missouri for Los Angeles, Pitt said: "I wasn't ready to call it quits as far as getting out into the world. It wasn't leaving something behind, it was heading for something that was nascent and ill-defined. I did not know what it would be when I got to L.A., and to me not knowing that has always been the most exciting thing about making a trip."[10]<br>  At this point in his life, girls didnt really think he was hot and he was turned down severally.|`|3lKAR9G2aa	Don't know about Brad, but Tom Selleck lost 3 times on the Dating Game.

NQFV2AdZaa	Ok, it could have just been that he was tired and because of that, he was grumpy and you caught him at a bad time. Either that or he got what he wanted by sleeping with you and now doesn't make any effort to try to be nice to you. Just wait and see if he apologises to you, if he doesn't don't contact him again as he was using you and you deserve a lot better than him!|`|wKCgaoZVaa	I know you don't want to hear this but it sounds like he's using you.  The fact that he got arsey shows that that is the true him, and if he thought he made a mistake then he wouldn't mind having that convo that you wanted.  <br>  <br>  I hope you find somebody better for you|`|mmMgfhf2aa	No, don't call him. He only wants what he can't have. If you go calling him (or chasing after him as he will see it) he won't want to know. Leave the guy to wonder what happened to you.

AA11181510	GET THE HELL AWAY FROM HIM NOW!!  He is a controlling and violant man. He isnt going to just all of a sudden change. He probably does love you, but the fact remains he is unable to control his anger. The only life you will have with him will be filled with insecurities, anxiety, jealousy, lies and fear. If he was able to stop himself from acting the way he does, he would have done so by now. I am quite sure he isn't happy with being angry all the time.  He simply can't stop himself and it will progressively get worse. I know from experiance. I was in a 4 yr relationship that started off much less violant and out of control than what you described. After being kidnapped and held against my will for a few days, I still wasn't ready to "abandon" him. I once again took him back. A couple returning  from a x-mas party found me unconscious on the side of the road and took me to a hospital. He had left for me for dead. I was beaten so badly that I couldn't even open my eye for 9 days, I had several broken bones and the worst part is that I had just found out I was pregnant. Key word...WAS. Please get as far away from him as you can. You have no idea what its like to see the man you love and be scared to death that your going to die, only to regain consciousness, see him and wish that you had. I don't know you but pray that you take this advise and not go through anything remotely close to the nightmare that was my life.|`|tLU6Ycmwaa	Just pack your things and leave, whatever you have in the home can be either replace or recovered at a later date. Your best bet is to leave now, before something terrible happens.|`|C0yMlCmPaa	You dont need to ask people here this question...you already KNOW the answer! LEAVE!

If you are that scared of him, then you need the support of your friends and family.  You should all just show up one night after work, maybe even have some police officers with you (yes, they will escort you there and stay while you pack) and then leave...and never ever tell him where you are going once you've left.  If you don't, expect more of the same, or worse.  You need to get out of this situation as soon as possible... you life is in danger!!|`|a0024a8805bd3c2a385199e722566faeaa	I usually don't advise people to end their relationships, but in this case it seems like you made a bad decision on your choice in men.  It's important to realize that you chose this man and there were qualities about him that you like.<br>  <br>  What I suggest that you do is to first find a place to go where he won't easily find you. Either get an apartment if you can afford it or move in with a friend or relative that he doesn't know where they live.  <br>  <br>  Pack up and move when he's away at work.  Please make sure that you get help from several relatives or female friends (don't have another man in his house).  Or see if you can call the police to get an escort.  Tell them that you're moving and that you're afraid that if he comes home you may be hurt.<br>  <br>  One last thing...TELL SOMEBODY!  Don't be embarrassed.  Tell your friends and family that you're scared of this guy and you need to leave.|`|fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	Do you live together? A temporary restraining order might be good to have cause this man will most likely turn violent on you. In any case, plan your escape. I assume he knows where you live? It would be the best to rent some other place without his knowledge. Even if it's just a room with roommates. Once your new place is ready, move all your stuff in one day. Hire moves if you have to. (you can find them at u-haul location). <br>  On the day of the move, call up your phone company and change your phone number. Inform only trusted friends of your new number, and specifically ask to not disclose it. <br>  This man will chase you. He is a maniac. That's why I recommend getting a restraining order first. <br>  <br>  I'm speaking from experience. I had to escape from a maniac myself once upon a time. Worst part of all, we lived together! I rented a room and hired movers. When he was at work, I had all my stuff moved in a matter of 2 hours. He was furious. I had to hide out at a police station. <br>  <br>  If you are asking about how to dump him - dump him over the phone. It's safer that way. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|PcyAHXKbaa	LEAVE HIM NOW... this is just like a movie.. people that hurt you physically dont love you.|`|AA10248966	It is simple: You must first recognize he is indeed and undiagnosed mental case who you went OFRS big time for the wrong reasons. You are indeed in danger.<br>  <br>  Next: I'd suggest sitting down with a detective at your local precinct concerning his physical and emotional abuse and tell them you are terrified.<br>  Also, go for  therapy and make sure it is part of what what you tell the therapist; when he has gotten physically abusive and emotionally abusive. Give great details. In a few weeks is when you must leave. Having the info0 on a therapist's records is testimony admissible in a court should you need it.<br>  <br>  Make sure you get a number of your friends to come over together simultaneously including at least two men to your HOME and help you move out. You are then to tell him he is not to stop you, not to follow you, not top call you for any reason...( do not tell him it is over because of his physical abuse and emotional abuse)....He will always be convinced you are cheating because most likely his a paranoid delusional, the technical term. My ex was one, and life with her was impossible.<br>  <br>  He is an undiagnosed mental case. He sweet talked you, he showered you Wear4rs, gifts, concern, and it sways all part of the act. No one can be with him. <br>  <br>  If you are fortunate, you will be able to leave with no hassles.<br>  <br>  The cops can also tell you and YOU MUST INSIST on how to get a criminal order of protection against him. You have to immediately arrange a different living situation in perhaps, Sunny side, Long Island City Queens,  Forest Hills, Queens, or with someone with a house or room, far enough away from him. Change your cell number and email address too immediately after moving and only give it to those who know you  and love you as a friend.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	he has issues and has probably treated others this way. i would say u need to move away from him, because love isn't like this. what u have is a violent man who will eventually harm. u seem to have very little in common with him, and the sooner u get out the better. sometimes we buy our own trouble and create a future we don't want because we stay with someone who isn't right for us. this man will suck the life out of u, emotionally and physically abuse u, and if u can't see this your doomed to a bad life.|`|AA11399389	What kind of life can you have with a man you are terrified of (and rightly so)?  I think you should get away as quickly as you can - even if it means you have to leave some of your things behind - you can always replace things.  You are right to be afraid of him and his friends - he has already shown you how violent he can be.  This is not someone that loves you in a way you want to be loved.<br>  <br>  Please, next time be more careful - if they are mean to other people, they will be mean to you once they've got you!|`|AA11996507	You say you're not his property, so why are you allowing him to treat you like you are?  If you are serious about not wanting to tolerate his treatment of you any longer, then do something about it.  Leave.  Move out.  You have friends, surely you can stay with one of them for a few days until you get your own place.  Don't wait, just pack your stuff and go.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	You already asked this question, and people told you exactly the same thing they are saying here: LEAVE HIM and DO NOT contact him anymore!<br>  <br>  Why are you still there, wondering IF you should leave this abusive man?¨??  <br>  <br>  Get your act together and get help so you can pack your things and leave when he is not around. Do this today...before you end up in a hospital or the morgue.|`|UQlfW4sAaa	Pack your things when he is not home. Buy a gun and learn how to use it if you don't already know. Something small, but powerful. I would recommend a Lady Smith. Just ask the gun dealer he will know what you are talking about. Keep it close to you at all times in case you are attacked. Then; Leave. If he finds you and tries to get violent remember; Do Not shoot to kill. Take out a knee cap or something to stop him from hurting you. If he has that kind of anger you could be in grave danger if you leave him that is why I am recommending such extreme action may be necessary. I hope it isn't. <br>  <br>  Get Away From Him As Soon As Possible before you get badly hurt!!!

While I don't condone cheating a kiss is a kiss...pretty harmless, now if it were more then I'd probably dump her. You have to make sure she is telling you the truth and if there is any lying going on. To me cheating and then lying about is the worst...no matter how far it went.<br>  <br>  Good luck -hope this helps...|`|BEy22O6jaa	forgive her, everyone makes mistakes, but re-examine your relationship and see where things are going so you can make a wise decision.|`|dODaX6tTaa	no once a cheater always a cheater and even if u give her a chance its gonnabe hard for you to trust her I think ur better off without her.|`|AazzM1gWaa	If you really love her...tell her that you love her and give her a kiss...this will bring the love back :)|`|dSTQnHPraa	kick her to the curb|`|7MSvSABvaa	give her a chance she didnt know what she was doing<br>  and it is your fault as well you should<br>  have been with her|`|w6dXWoPzaa	FIRST TIME  ... yea.. 2nd time NO|`|SndrZbn8aa	I wouldn't forgive her. She really should be more careful about getting so drunk that she can't even walk. What if those around her weren't so honest and took advantage of her drunken state even more so than what did happen? Where does this lead your relationship? She gets drunk and uses it as an excuse to cheat or generally break the trust of your relationship. Another point is no matter how drunk I have gotten I have had the capability of understanding who is my boyfriend and who isn't and have never cheated on someone because of my drinking. Sure being drunk reduces inhibitions but I would have to be prone to cheating anyway. That's just me though. <br>  If you do forgive her every time she goes out are you going to be able to trust her?
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	its one of the hardest things when u divorce to deal with, not doing the paperwork won't stop the divorce. when u can't decide on who gets what, it makes the divorce cost more. judges usually put the parties in mediation, and they end up having to decide eventually anyway.your bro is probably the one who really doesn't want the divorce, and it is difficult to end a marriage.|`|AA10065812	???<br>  Give this to your brother<br>  <br>  I’ve been a Father’s Rights Advocate for 20 years.   <br>  <br>  Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.  Also, learn how to make sure the judge is being balance is his decision by using Court Watch.<br>  <br>  Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.  <br>  <br>  Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  You’re that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.

If you are not his official lawyer, then your opinion on whether he should fill out that "who-gets-what" portion would not matter much to him. I suggest that you let him decide on his own.

Take a tampon with you and or a pad and tell him that you are on your period pretty heavily. Either he'll understand or he won't and if not, I wouldn't worry with it. You going to the doctor is more important than keeping him from being mad.

lya3IPybaa	Good or bad, stop talking about others. then she will stop telling your secrets. and find a better friend, there are ways to maintain a friendship with the sister that doesn't involve her. <br>  <br>  <br>  either that or tell her straight out how you really feel,
0Z6rqZ1Faa	I know what your talking about here. I really liked this guy and he did the same kind of stuff to me. It started out all sweet, cute text messages slightly flirty always initiated by him. You feel like you really click and you want to send him a text to say I had a great time even though you know it would be better to wait for him to text you, but its just so hard to resist the urge cause he has gotten into your head. So you text him and your heart flutters a bit until the next day when you realize that he has ignored that text message you had drafted in your head all day and spent hours agonizing over if he would reply. So after a few days of silence you wonder if he will ever call or text you again. Just when you are starting to lose hope 1 new message appears on your phone and its him and you are so glad he hasn't disappeared forever - your heart ache disappears, you become elated then it starts all over again every time you see him but the closer you get to him the longer it takes him to want to see you again. Am I on the mark here? This happened to me for twelve months (I slept with him stupidly!) Finally I said enough and I can't do this anymore and stopped texting him back and answering his calls. It hurt at first but not as much as it hurt every time he ignored me. My advice is get out now, he sounds like a player. A nice guy who is really interested in you replies to your text messages, he sends you a text to say he had a great time, he doesn't blow you off.|`|we29e8Iyaa	Personally, I think it would be best to let him make the move the next few days after you hang out. That way he’ll have to put in the effort to text or call you and he won’t get the wrong impression and assume that you’re clinging to him.<br>  Plus, it’ll probably make you feel really special when he’s the first one to speak up (:<br>  If he’s really into you and values your friendship, he’ll contact you!<br>  Best of luck.|`|ihqZX4GMaa	He's either playing you to get you to think about him -- and you are haha.<br>  <br>  or he's inconsiderate.<br>  <br>  Why don't you stop being a little girl and ask him. When he denies it, explain that you like him and want to spend time and be responded to on time.<br>  <br>  My girl always responds but when she doesnt I say "HEY!!!" But she like me. Does he like you? Do you want a jerk to like you?<br>  <br>  Oh and dont get pregnant!|`|5DTqXmoBaa	he dont want anything serious, he justt wants to fool around with you when you guys are together.<br>  dont bother him, just let him call you when he wants to.|`|rvZwvVsuaa	well U can stop being friends, but I don't think that's shot U want, so hand with him when he wants you to and don't freak when he doesn't want to hang with you boys are weird but stuff works out.|`|e97vt0Slaa	I think he either really does view you as just a friend or he has another girl that he's seeing or living with. <br>  But if he was really into you, he would at least return your calls or texts.|`|s5F745gBaa	Like the person above me. And maybe he just wants to concerntrate on his studies.|`|3qaXA0oBaa	you shouldn't send texts and phone calls. guys are attracted to the chase. it doesn't sound like you want to be just friends, otherwise it wouldn't bother you that he doesn't respond when you want him to, so stop calling and texting him and wait for him to call you. plus you have set up a situation where you are becoming the f-u-c-k buddy even though you haven't had actual sex. he even referred to you as his bff!  if you want to know what's going on ask him BEFORE making out and don't call anymore. he will not commit to you ar be your boyfriend at all if you keep trying too hard.|`|qOzEuQofaa	He calls you just when he's lonely and needs attention.

To me thats just saying hes already looking to be with others.<br>  <br>  I honestly think he may have some insecurities about himself, which is why he would complain your too wet. Does he need to put you down to make himself feel better?|`|lD1MBeAMaa	He thinks that's what you want. Tell him what you REALLY want and if you're lucky, you'll get it.

st9KHhoKaa	unfortunately i was never one of those lucky people who had parents that supported them, understood them or let them dream. <br>  <br>  When i become a mother i will <br>  <br>  NEVER put my children through what my mother did/ other family members and other people such as the following: <br>  <br>  i will never argue with my husband in front of the child, alot of people have no idea what it is like having 2 drunk, medicated, adults having loud, abusive arguments in front of a little kid and how that effects them. ) <br>  <br>  i will NEVER kick my children out of home, i will get the support, love and help they need and never give up on them ( my parents kicked me outta home at 14) <br>  <br>  i will never drink to such a point i have no control , do drugs, medications or otherwise in an inappropriate manner in front of my children<br>  <br>  i will NEVER hit or abuse my children, or swear at them or lock them up in their rooms or lock the front door and kick them outside<br>  then threaten to call the police <br>  <br>  i will NEVER accuse my children or lying ( if they haven't), or accuse them of things they have not done <br>  <br>  i will NEVER force my children to take medications if they do not need them, or force them to go see pychologists/counsellors <br>  <br>  i will NEVER force religion onto my children down their throat, i will bring them up in a household that has morals, beliefs in god, respect, discipline in a loving, caring, healthy way <br>  <br>  i will NEVER tell my children they cannot dream or accomplish what they set out to do in life, i will support and give them the advice and tools in order to succeed in life<br>  <br>  I WILL ALWAYS feed them, give them clothes to wear, a stable home, a caring home, pets to take off to teach responsibility, take them to the doctor and provide everything else they need in life, however when they are teenagers they will need to have part time jobs in order to learn the value of money and that it just doesent grow on trees <br>  <br>  i will ALWAYS work on my relashionship with my husband and love him in order to be an example to my children what a healthy, relashionship is having a mother and father that respect each other and care for each other. <br>  <br>  just saying this makes me cry, because i had the worst childhood you could imagine, i went through alot  and vowed i would never put my children through what i went through.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	I would have loved to have had a mom who didn't resent my (and my siblings') existence as being the ones who kept her from fulfilling her own dreams, and who didn't take out that resentment on us with endless petty torments.<br>  <br>  But you know what they say -- "Wish in one hand, sh** in the other, and see which one fills up first."|`|UjEAn0bWaa	I love my mom just the way she is|`|1Qha5gwVaa	she would be my best friend.|`|P0T4lHKTaa	Hot|`|ufNJ0Oviaa	Kind of like my old friend Sami's mom.<br>  Buys her cigarettes and let's her drink.<br>  Is the kind of mom that you could be best friends with.<br>  You can go and tell her the kinds of things you've done with boys and expect her to be calm about it.<br>  Cool about pretty much everything.<br>  <br>  She's not the best parent, but she's a cool one.|`|5agXk9ldaa	well very proud of my mom i want nothing less and nothing more <br>  all i want is that she lives as long as possible because she is my angel and my Inspiration
86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	It is crazy to love someone who is not going to love you back and you know it.  Start thinking about the little signs he gives you to keep you hanging on as an insult and that could well help you get over him.  After all he is only playing games to keep you dangling while massaging his own ego.  What he is doing is cruel and you should respond accordingly - forget him and move on to happiness.|`|FzFSzilmaa	if he's stopped thinking about you, why would he contact you at midnight to go for a drive???<br>  <br>  sounds more than FwB to me...|`|BjA1aZd9aa	Try to think about someone else..may be your family, your friends who care about you more than him..otherwise tell him that you love him if u do, so that you may know what he thinks about you..or ask him for marry just for checking him that what he wants..is he just passing his time with you, or want some more..like marriage!  do confirm it, what he wants..otherwise if it bother you so pretend whenever he asks for going some where ..  Best of Luck|`|dJoE8yedaa	I'm exactly where you are in life right now. We're in love with people who don't love us back. Live life, spend time with the girls and try to keep busy. Hopefully eventually his memory will start to fade. I'm following my own advice.|`|HsuoFa6qaa	Try to get closer to another guy or make a new best friend. See his reaction and judge. If it seems protective/angry/sad, then ask him for an explanation or a reason for such feelings. If he doesnt seem to care then he really must not be interested in you so forget him and try making new friends....<br>  Hope this helps =D

ZJCjgOPuaa	u should not break up.It can may be be that u both dont have any topic to talk about.Dont do that.do something which can spice ur relationship.Make her impress.etc<br>  surely it will work<br>  If u feel that she is not interested in u then just once ask her frankly and clear it with her if anything is their in ur mind.<br>  that will be much better and will make ur relationship quite strong<br>  BEST OF LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|VK8wELFUaa	Haha, id say do something to spice up your relationship. Do things out of the blue to surprise her and take her places new! Theres lots of things you can do to get the boredom out of your relashionship. If you both love eachother it' ll work out, but you might as well make life more fun! good luck!|`|vWUuo023aa	Dont break the relation bcz she have irritated to u. U dont call her for some time and she will call u thats my promise bcz my exprience  she is fed up.<br>  U wait and watch she will come again ur life.|`|1rmSuG2Haa	The main reason you're both bored is because you are in a LDR. Its very difficult to have any fun or solid memories together online and on a phone all the time -- these outlets only go so far and eventually you will need more IN PERSON time than online/phone time to equal up to her.<br>  <br>  If you don't see you two being closer together VERY SOON, then I say yes, split up now because it won't get easier for either of you. Imagine if you are bored of each other now, what will it be like 5 years from now?.. <br>  <br>  If you don't break up soon, or get closer (same city, house or get married) SOON then one of you will eventually betray the other and someone will end up with a broken heart.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you both!

To refuse to accept, submit to, believe, or make use of.<br>  2. To refuse to consider or grant; deny.<br>  3. To refuse to recognize or give affection to (a person).<br>  4. To discard as defective or useless; throw away. See Synonyms at refuse1.<br>  <br>  How to respond to that?<br>  <br>  1.Keep composure. This means as soon as they say no, don't let one hair fall out of place. Stand up straight and tilt your head to the right as if to say "Aw, that's okay. I almost feel sorry for you that you'll never see the real me." <br>  2.Set up a friendship. After your headcock, swallow in your tears and give a sly smile. Say "No big. Let's be friends." <br>  3.Give them a hug or handshake. Feel the moment. If a handshake is more appropriate at the time, by all means do the handshake, not the hug! The hug could make the situation even more awkward. <br>  4.Walk away. Don't try anything fancy to regain their liking. Just turn on your heel and go find someone to talk to.

If someone has confidence then they are more likely to do something when others wont. <br>  I suppose that the more confident poeple will be mixing with a group of people, dancing, singing, playing a game or something that will show that they are not shy. They give someone eye contact, dont cross their arms, have their shoulders back normally and just...well look confident. <br>  There is no real profile for girls i am afraid so you will have to just try your luck out <br>  Hope this helps|`|q9bq625Kaa	It is unusual that a girl would ask a guy out. But if they like you they will give you signs so follow the signs.  Usually if a girl asks you out she is either desperate or too over confident.

Better to have them there just in case you need them. I mean, if you have to get rid of yours...then why shouldn't she? She could use them to cheat just as much as you could. You two need to trust each other and just let things be.|`|HKkbqlIuaa	Well, I don't think there's anything wrong with someone carrying condoms.

AA12167923	Couples break up for a number of reasons and, of course, cheating is one of them.  You say in your post that you are "paranoid", but I don't believe that is the problem - your girlfriend has not given you any kind of reason for you to even worry about her cheating.  I'm female and I sense from your post that you are more of a "controlling" type of person than a paranoid.  Keep that up and you will lose her one day.  I know - I was in a relationship for 7 years with someone that I loved very much; but he was so controlling that he was smothering me and I had to leave him - in "controlling me", he was destroying me and he called that "love" - sorry, but no, that is not love.  Some people just have to be in control of everything and that is very unhealthy for the people in their world that they claim to love.<br>  <br>  And what do you mean by saying "should I give her the benefit of the doubt and trust her word" when she has done nothing to deserve any doubt or lack of trust on your part - just because you "often hear about couples breaking up because one cheated" is no excuse for you to feel this way or even ask such a question .  If you don't want to lose this woman, than I suggest that you give your girlfriend the trust that she deserves.|`|72UNDrwkaa	if she has never given you any reason to think she has cheated then don't worry, you are just being paranoid x|`|AvbyOD8eaa	why would you feel the need to give her the benefit of the doubt? thats what you need to ask yourself. if you truly love her then you should know deep down inside that she isnt cheating on you. i mean if shes around you as often as she is dont you think you would know? maybe you should talk to her about your insecurities... this is something the two of you need to talk about. but in all honesty if you dont want to loose her trust her. dont give her the "benefit of the doubt" TRUST HER!!!!|`|PbPiF2p3aa	If you dont stop being paranoid then you will lose her. Women can only put up with that paranoid crap for so long.

Leave her alone about it, if her body is mature enough, and she is doing it, then she has obviously learned to be mature about it.

y4zYkceEaa	The term "all" shouldn't be used. "Some" men cheat even women. Just get over your insecurities. Not all the men you fall for will hurt you. Just have faith! You're in a fresh relationship so it a pretty normal feeling, being the fact that your past realtionships with men weren't so good. Don't compare this relationship with your past relationships. Look to the future & forget the past. Good luck ;))|`|9bdEPcWIaa	Don't think that way,  men and women cheat for whatever reasons but there are many who don't and won't.|`|GqTSa85daa	No, most men don't.

It is one way to chase him away.<br>  <br>  If you have serious issues with jealousy, insecurities and trust, see if you can get a therapist to help you learn to deal with these feelings.|`|YfsqXG3naa	all men are not cheater however you came to think so ONLY because you tend to choose cheaters unconsciously|`|2d161d1ede80ea983c1d8b6f85f0e0b5aa	You past experiences make you a bit paranoid. But some always cheat but don't generalise....may be this time, you find a right man.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Not all men cheat.|`|ICjBorriaa	you need to just have more confidence in yourself, you need to be able to say to yourself that you are totally gorgeous and it would not matter that much to you if you were cheated on, sure you would be annoyed by it but you would get over it. You can get over it because you are comfortable with your own life. <br>  <br>  Your current boyfriend should just be a compliment, an addition to your life, he should not be your LIFE. If your boyfriend is not a compliment/addition to your totally awesome life then you should improve your life in other ways. <br>  <br>  May be you should just pop the question and ask him to marry you. That is the only sure way to ensure he is totally into you. Would you want to marry him? Or would it be OK if you broke up just because you drift apart or just got fed up? Those are the kinds of questions you need to ask yourself|`|9GmoO5NLaa	It is not easy to trust people when you have been hurt, but I think to assume that all men cheat because someone cheated on you is not the right way to think about things.  Especially if you like this guy.<br>  <br>  If you really do like him, try to slowly but surely trust him.  If he has given you nothing to suspect him then don't worry!  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately some men do cheat on their partners, the same way some women do cheat on theirs, just try not to tar everybody with the same brush!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your problem and your relationship.|`|AA10382645	Just because the licorice jelly beans taste like garbage doesn't mean all jelly beans taste bad. The fact of the matter is some men and cheat and some do not. Do not treat this guy like hes a cheater before he has done anything to merit suspicion. If you treat him like hes about to cheat  or has the potential to cheat on you I promise you will lose him. To put your mind at ease, to date I have never cheated on a girlfriend there are still nice guys out there and from the sounds of it you have one. Don't mess it up.|`|14sTdBPaaa	seem like you don't have much experience since you askin' tis question... anyway, you can never based one relation onto the other, it will only suffer you inside thinking "when will he cheat on me"... you should never compare because you will never find the right one in such ways, it will always make you play the blame game toward your next partner, despite them being good to you... forget about your past and move on...|`|m2eHPeciaa	insecurities come from within. u said u were cheated on before (your story seems jus like me) and possibly ur insecure about urself as well. the only way if u wanna keep this guy, is (seriously) see a therapist. if u want a lasting "healthy" relationship, i would either seek that, or try meditation. (which i do, and it really works)|`|ff904c82d6fc259920960bcaad384421aa	No absolutely not. Some men are very faithful to their woman. Im an example. Ive been cheated on by my ex wife and gave up on relationships. Jealousy comes from a guilty mind that you might cheat on him.|`|OadMCKfgaa	Not all men cheat.  You've just been hurt in the past.  You get over your insecurities by getting over the past, because it kind of sounds like you're not over it if you think every man cheats.|`|HqEdWTfIaa	i actually went through the same thing. the only thing that can make those insecurities fade is time. if you guys stay together a long time and he doesnt cheat on you pretty soon they will go away. just try to hide them as much as you can until they do go away or else you will just end up pushing him away. and no not all guys cheat. but alot of them do. so when you find one you think is actually good you dont want to risk scaring him away|`|qmL84hXXaa	Not all men cheat on their partners, but there a lot of them out there that do. <br>  <br>  Do not let your previous relationships taint your new one.

First of all, he had serious financial problems and as the relationship progressed, it seemed like all he wanted was security from me. Be careful just how much you give this man. It sounds like he is manipulating your feelings when he brings up trivial matters like breaking up. If its love, it really shouldn't be an issue. Good luck!
crxbob5jaa	Happened to a good friend. She was able to move the wedding up and use the deposit money towards the new date. The wedding came together in 3 - 4 weeks and she was married.<br>  <br>  (However her mother actually did end up in the emergency room the week following the wedding from chest pains caused by all the stress of what happened.)|`|lgxE5nUoaa	If you are comfortable being pregnant at the time of your wedding, then your dress will simply need alternations right up to the big day.  If you want to postpone, that is entirely fine.  Or if you'd prefer to get married a lot sooner, you can do that too.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Put the skirt and corset to one side and wait until a couple of months before your wedding to see what size you are then get a maternity wedding dress.<br>  You can always have a renewal of marriage vows/blessing in a year or twos time when your baby is here.|`|CLJXTsFJaa	A few probs you may need to change the top piece of the dress as wearing a corset could be harmfull to your unborn baby.  <br>  <br>  August would make you approx 6 months preg at the time and you could very well have a baby belly by then.<br>  <br>  You could try post poning the wedding tilll after the baby is born no harm in ringing up and finding out.<br>  <br>  You could do what I did and sell your dress and wear another one.  I was 7 months pregnant when I got married couldn't fit my dress so wore my mothers ethnic evening gown.

But what you picked out will not fit you by august.|`|msoDXmvuaa	congrats kidd|`|55Xq3a5Laa	Ouch, well the best thing to do would be to find a pregnant-friendly dress. I can tell you that you're not going to be able to squeeze into that dress  6 months from now, your baby will be quite large by then. Its unfortunate but you can still look good on your wedding day, just find a new dress and carry on! Good luck!|`|RiHiOCANaa	Don't postpone!!

I mean, just ask her, maybe I'm wrong.  Definitely ask her though, to see if you still have a chance.|`|TQg7yubGaa	I would say that she does like you.  And that now she is either trying to play hard to get, or she is annoyed that you haven't asked her out.  Go for it, the worst she can say is no, right.  And trust me, there are worse things in life than not getting the date you want.  More than likely she is shy around you, because she likes you, and she doesn't want to do/say anything she will regret later.  Good luck kiddo!|`|bFKUFOOsaa	Personally, I think she likes you as well but she is worried that the feeling isn't mutual.

Be bold, make a move and she will greatly appreciate it. Good luck.

I really can't say what that child thought moments before he shot her. The warden doesn't even want him in his facility. I wouldn't either. It's just disgusting just looking and thinking about what he did.|`|RiHiOCANaa	horrible parenting, traumatic experiences... sad story it makes me sick|`|b87482cd8013bcfad52b6cff60829a6eaa	No Idea its terrible and sooo sad for all involved :(|`|ea2N73etaa	I think this is so sad. I hope that I don't ever have to go through anything like this. As for people blaming video games, TV, and other such media alone. I just have one thing to say take some responsibility. Don't pass the buck off to someone else. Stop blaming everyone else for the problems we as parents put on our kids. If we seen something that was violent our parents told us that this is NOT the right way to act. Not only that, but if people would just follow the rating on TV and Video games kids wouldn't have to see all of this crap. That's why its there. Used you parental controls, and take some responsibility for once. I'm so Sick of seeing video games this video games that. Don't give it to your kids and guess what They Won't See It. WOW, amazing what little things can do!|`|0i8mypwDaa	I have no idea. Maybe he was jealous of her.|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	Idk i Didnt look At It What is It?? is It Something Scary?
WRC0O6tqaa	you shouldnt let ur girl friend to Use online dating website or chating websites because of this u might lose her....<br>  if she really loves u then she will follow u after u tell her to stop visiting chating and datin websites|`|d9tCS7BPaa	DUH! Of course you should. Obviously she doesn't want things to be that serious or exclusive between you both. I would reconsider being in a relationship with her, honestly.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	Yes indeed you should! The reason for online dating is to hook up with other people.
WnLLU2Jlaa	Oh hes probally one of those guys who says 'stupid' stuff in order to get your attention who bes a jerk when he really likes you. Point is he is still immature about girls. I bet he even talks about you having cooties hahahaha jp.<br>  <br>  Yes he likes you thinks you are pretty, he might not like your height but it isn't enough dislike to make him stop looking is it? ;]<br>  Exactly.<br>  So theres your answer. Goodluck ; ]|`|4eSNdJ33aa	Dont worry yaar u just keep in touch with him and try 2 know understand his feelings and also try his likes and dislikes for your better . and talk 2 him

If she doesn't mind paying for that dates while he looks for a job, then why not?  If they like one another and have things in common, they have a right to be with one another.  Personally, that age gap is too large for me, and I prefer dating people older than I, but if it makes her happy.|`|angW1Lkfaa	Read about the girl that has been supporting her mooching husband for 5 years and she wants to known when enough is enough. Oh about 4 years ago and the other one that is supporting her bf because he doesn't want to work.  It's ok to pay if you don't mind being played. Let's see I bet you are number? What does it take to wake you girls up?|`|2uXNtCUlaa	if your not comfortable with him not paying for your dates then tell hm/break up..if you don't mind then there is no problem|`|XKhNw221aa	it's called sugar momma, you pay, while he pleasures.|`|BwJOeHDEaa	dump him (if its you) if hes 22 and doesnt have a job, chances are, he probably doesnt haave much of a future either, most people are graduating college at the age of 22, so unless he just got out of school or hes in school and hes just going througha rough time, i would dump him..its cool paying for dates or going stag every once in a while, but the girl to pay for everything?? come on now....|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	That sounds about right? dont you think?|`|fc9c5ac698b0813fa1de35f84e7cf006aa	It's just as okay as a guy paying for everything for a girl younger than him.|`|F7O0nLK1aa	im 29 and marrying a 25 year old guy, we both were laid off and went back to school. times are tough, but love is love, money doesnt change that.|`|szJzZ9myaa	No, ditch him for someone who won't sponge off of you.|`|IpWTMetHaa	Why b a doormat to anyone???|`|dat8eoYyaa	okay, other way around i could understand....if guy was the 1 older...but thats just strange|`|HQEn6jbnaa	hell yes|`|edPhZOZmaa	go for it. as to who will pay the bill is not a problem. If it is alright for you to pay then pay the bill. You can not expect him to pay but if we will offer to pay then let him pay.  Wanting to know him is not limited to just eating with him. explore for some inexpensive activities for both of you to know more of each other.|`|5qdpmoTdaa	Sounds like she needs someone more mature.. and he needs to grow up.. he needs to get it together because if I were her she deserves better and someone equally dedicated to the relationship and being a working person. the earlier you figure out these issues the better - they only get worse.|`|cbt4I1cuaa	im still old fashion not at all he is 22 its time to get up and get a JOB  quit taking care of that little boy you need to find a real man not that 28 and 22 are a lot different its just that he isn't taking care of whats important|`|msoDXmvuaa	the economy sucks... go easy on the guy.. he'll make it up to you  .. and if he doesnt o well. would u feel like a loser if he payed for you everyday? .. he will feel the same way you will.. so think about that before you judge someone over money|`|55Xq3a5Laa	It shouldn't really matter who is paying for the dates as long as no one is being used.|`|Poif4h01aa	Absolutely not ok. As a 28/29 year old women you need a man not a boy.|`|zWgqQpE3aa	if they are both comfortable with it, then I see no problem|`|ai76o21qaa	yeah hell i was 21 and she was 31 go for it lil buddy
EJWphb88aa	If both of u are ready for the responsibility to be the best parents then don waste more time.. go ahead..<br>  <br>  Another suggestion <br>  Plan the birth of your child as per the academic year of the country you reside.. (just be little foresighted)|`|O36qjj7Oaa	That's entirely up to you and your husband.<br>  <br>  Nobody can tell you when its the right time for you to have a baby.|`|fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	Do not wait. From the medical point of view, any time now, and the sooner the better. <br>  Sorry but as a pre-school teacher you'll never be rich anyway, unless you start doing something else part-time.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	It's not a certain age that you should wait for, it's the stability you need. Do you have the financial resources to provide the basic needs for a baby? Not many people are 100% financially secure when a baby comes, but there is a big difference between needing welfare to provide and being able to live comfortably with a new child. So it's really up to you, do you feel ready? Have you talked about who is going to be staying home? Will there be any work schedule changes for the spouse who will keep working? Can you financially provide for your baby?|`|vcxzt3R6aa	I would not say there's a certain age, personally I would wait until I knew I was financially stable enough to afford a baby but, there are organizations that can help you out like WIC which helps out a lot. If your living comfortably and not struggling I say go for it!!|`|msoDXmvuaa	not the age.. the money boo boo.. cause thats what ur kid will care about when its 16  not you|`|aTrtdRxXaa	nobody can tell you when to have your baby,etc.<br>  If you & your husband feel ready & confident then go for it...just make sure you are totally ready,bcuz babies are a lot of work & can be stressful at times,I have a 4 month old daughter nd is a handful<br>  <br>  hope I helped & GOOD LUCQ!!

umGi6gTcaa	He already knows your lying so just come clean. Tell him your nervous about meeting him and that you didn't look your best, which is what you want to look when you two finally do come face to face.<br>  <br>   Arrange the meeting asap, some where public of course. Invite another couple to tag along and go play billiards or bowling or something. If you keep putting it off, especially after last night, he's just going to move on.|`|Q0i7iMmRaa	No way, you already lied about it, you should only tell the truth before you tell a lied, if you lie stick with it. But now you can never met him in person because he already saw you at the pool hall, he'll never believe it wasn't you after staring at you in person. Oh wait maybe you can dye your hair, change your make-up, get colored contacts, ( mini make-overs are fun ) just do stuff to change your appearance, then meet him! Dang thats a great idea! Just act like you looked that way for awhile, and then say the pics he saw were kinda old. that should totally work!|`|AA11266289	i woudl jsut tell him what really happened, he will understand, and he will probably like the fact that you care enough about him that you dont want to make him jealous|`|BwJOeHDEaa	i would tell him the truth..but be sure to tell him what you told us, lik eit was your first time with the internet dating thing and you were sorry for lying, but you were out with frineds and didnt want to be rude and text..and if hes mad about you being out with other guys, blow him off, you guys havent even really 'met' yet and you rnot dating or anything like that..they could have been your family for all he knows, if he says anything about it, tell him that you guys are all friends or whatever...but yeah i would tell him the truth, it was all just a misunderstanding anyways..|`|xQdjprjgaa	im pretty sure he already knows it was you. he's just trying to get you to admit it to him. so just start with, " hey ,was it you the other day at the pool "<br>  <br>  and if hes like "?" then just drop it. but otherwise im sure youll have a laugh over it all, its tricky meeting people from the internet, he shouldnt have any "feelings" for you just yet, you havent even met, agh boys are so stupid like that, you cant fall in love on like msn.<br>  <br>  anyways good luck :)
OOwUlO4Jaa	I am so sorry for you, you sound as if you have been conned big time. you are going to be a mother soon and some little baby is going to be depending on you for love warmth and care. you must start thinking of this and you can be the best mother in the world, it might be hard at times but your responsibility is for your baby now.

lD1MBeAMaa	Yes it is normal to feel that way. The easiest way to resolve this is to not hang out with her anymore. I recently had a friend who was like that and It was very annoying.

When you have another persons opinion that may alter or question what is or is not acceptable amount of partners to have, 1 can be too many for some!<br>  Your suppose to be interested in the person not in their sexual encounters ... do you keep tally?<br>  If your happy and healthy then why bring up an individuals pass unless its information volunteered.
7Jm2ZZGzaa	wow what a time u had! yeah its definitely possible that she got pregnant if the condom broke. i really hope shes not!! that would suck!|`|VVk0hHgpaa	It can only take just one time to get pregnant .  Hopefully she is not pregnant.  She should take the morning after pill & you both should NOT  have sex until  you're both old enough.  Thankfully you were wise enough to wear a condom.|`|xCqNTjGLaa	yeah she could, the only thing i will say is that if you like this girl you sould have more respect for her and not let your friend have sex with her. its bad enough if she did it behind your back but to willingly let her, and especially at your age"!|`|4zVi6gvgaa	It's possible she got pregnant but pretty unlikely. Talk to her about it if your worried.|`|XoOanmdraa	wow...you're in so much trouble|`|Yg51SGlsaa	HOLY ****????<br>  <br>  YOU'RE 13 YEARS OLD FOR GOD'S SAKE??<br>  <br>  Did you not see that news story of that 13 year old kid in england who had a child? (turned out he didn't but surely that was a major warning)<br>  <br>  It's very likely she could fall pregnant. But to disrespect those girls by swapping partners is .... ugh!<br>  I am disgusted.<br>  <br>  Sure you had a great time and you tried to be safe about it but kids should not be having sex.<br>  <br>  Go ahead and masturbate all you want....but sex??<br>  <br>  I Hope you learn your lesson and for both your sakes that she is not pregnant!|`|5og4JXhbaa	Yeah she can get pregnant, You would be better contacting the girl that you had sex with and find out has she been sick or missed her period then if that did happen i think you 2 should head to a sex clinic to get some advise.<br>  Sex clinic you don't have to give your name or age so they wont report you to any one you don't want to know.|`|JRFU8gUcaa	There is always the possibility of her getting pregnant, there is no guarantee, even if she's on birth control.
PFVqo1wkaa	when my crush talking to me with his eyes on the floor cuz he's too shy to look at me, so i would move my head down to his face to see his eyes, then my crush would raise his head all of a sudden cuz he's surprised. then he'd give me a sly smile n look down again still smiling. haha they're so cute when they do that. <br>  i'm not a perv or smthing but i find it cuter when my crush is younger than me cuz he'll be so unexperienced so i can take over! not always but its cute. <br>  another cuteness: BIG EYES, BUBBLY FACE, MESSY HAIR N CRAZY WALKING! <br>  i find it hot+cute when guys are somewhat quiet sometimes but smiles very often. sense of humor is important dude.|`|HuJmTs8xaa	I like him to be respectable, modest, honest, be able to help himself as in not lazy, mature, sympathetic, and understanding.|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	Well i think the way a guy looks at you when he has a crush on you is cute, i think the way he trys to get your attention is cute too!|`|gVMmdeLcaa	a guy who is a little bit shy when talking to you, cos it shows he likes u and over confidence can be seen as arrogant... a guy who calls u evry night just to say gd night.. a guy who makes up a pet name specifically for u instead of just sweetie or baby or whatever. Thats cute... ( i could go on 4ever but i'll stop there :-)|`|AL2IqssLaa	shyness love it! haha<br>  but gotta be confident in bed!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkvR4eWLtFg6KN74ujkJBhjty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222230428AA29vMH">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|msoDXmvuaa	listen doggie .. all u gotta do is have tight swagaa.. style and confidence will take the clothes off any female.. 20's 30's 40' 50's ..all a woman wants is the truth.. trust me
F2rI3Juaaa	That would be a wonderful surprise! Go for it!|`|n6RRUxCDaa	i would tell him, because what if he has something planned already.|`|nmiIHzczaa	You should at least find some way to make sure that he is not busy or have something going on that he cant get out of. Maybe have one of his friends say that he is gonna take him out to a show or something with a specific time frame so you know that he will be able to hang out with you no matter what when you get there. <br>  I know that if my girl did that for me it would be a great birthday present. I would love to spend my b-day with my girlfriend. I think you are doing a great thing and any guy would be lucky to have a girl that cared so much that she would put in that much effort just to go see him on his special day. That's too bad I cant steal you for myself, my gf gave me a horrible gift for Valentines day, she dumped me.  :(  I would absolutely love it if she were to do what you did. But that's just me.|`|knzAbR9vaa	If you have already visited each other before and he says he cant wait to see you again its cool. If you have never met before your taking a big risk by acting needy. I have a LDR and invited her to meet me and she came out, and it went well and she misses me now so when we meet again I know it will be real. Get it?|`|0vmPXCYeaa	I would hint to him. Say you are going to send something and that he should be expecting it at such and such time and etc..|`|lI0KxrLBaa	If he truly likes/loves you..than hell yes...if he doesn't have other plans..if a girl did that for me I would be thrilled and I'd drop any plans I already had lol|`|U3lxRnjnaa	I have done that before and hey guess what?. She is on bed with another guy. I told myself not to have do another time!!!
5VHWy0Ggaa	how embarassing! i've only done that in my life once and it was randomly when i was exremly sick with pneunomia... ummm but anyway i think you would still have a chance. it was something that you could not control, and if he can't understand that... then that's his problem! <br>  <br>  he probably won't even ever bring it up again, so it's probably not a big deal...<br>  <br>  and if he's a jerk about it, then you deserve better anyway!|`|vj2pWs9Maa	Haha, are you serious!??<br>  <br>  I think you still have a chance - he didn't look disgusted or walk away!  :)|`|KvEcy40qaa	oh god thats gross...no move on|`|dHH4Rl2yaa	Probably.  Some guys are amused by girls farting.  Hopefully he's not the latter.  All my boyfriends have to get used to it in a day lol.  He'll probably realize you had an embarrassing moment and feel sorry for you rather than grossed out.  If he really likes you, he may think its cute (since he doesn't know its a shart).  Sharting incidence always happen at the worst times!|`|441002ba222c31246fd283fc8f2694bfaa	He almost definitely doesn't care.<br>  A fart can be unattractive to a girl, but most guys will find it amusing. Or so i have seen.|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	I queef'd while reading this.
VUR8hhiTaa	I met my boyfriend on <a href="http://wwwsinglesnet.info" rel="nofollow">http://wwwsinglesnet.info</a><br>  It took about a month, and he showed interest in me. I registered for a lot of different ones, and didn't like most. This one is the best so far, and the best thing is it is free!|`|Oanxigplaa	Personally, I'd go with a paid site if you can afford it.  I've always found that people on there are a bit more serious about dating!<br>  <br>  EHarmony has a great reputation and I can vouch that it is really good  but you do pay a bit more than normal dating sites. If I had to choose, I'd go with eharmony, but there are other good sites. <br>  <br>  If you're in the States, try match.com or Yahoo Personals.  If you're in the UK, I'd try Dating Direct.  You can try out both for free using the links here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mydatinggenie.com/Free_Trials..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mydatinggenie.com/Free_Trials...</a><br>  <br>  They're all about the same price range I think, maybe $20 a month??<br>  <br>  Of course you might get lucky and find someone during the free trial period ;o)|`|0kP7a73Iaa	You may want to check this site out as i found it most safe and secure for online dating service.  www.icety.info/matchmaking
8t0DlWf8aa	this is not true..you dont need to love yourself first and then love someone else...you may have done bad things to yourself or to the others however you can love..noone is perfect.just be the better character you can
0IhGanoZaa	it never fully disappears just try not to dwell on the past think o well thats then and this is now and when you find someone i think you'll kinda forget about the past cause you have them now so its not really a problem|`|OYFoYDOaaa	first, when u have a broken heart dont do drugs LOL.<br>  <br>  u can't fix it really. you can just set it aside, what i mean is.<br>  forgive YOURSELF for letting it happen even if its your fault.<br>  forsake all hurting feelings and well find yourself a new girl!<br>  it'll help ya out!
56LJzg3baa	well he is obviously making you feel stupid, and in my opinion, you should tell him how you feel, and that u can't be bothered to wait anymore. he is just messing you about and i would just forget about him. i know it could be hard if you really like him, but it is for the best, and to save you from getting hurt :)|`|dnwJmNkdaa	Sounds to me like he may have legitamately single when he met you but dating someone... The only time I've ever acted like this was when too many girls suddenly became more than friends at the same time...He may be trying to get a prespective but at the very least he owes you an explanation... He has technically done nothing wrong except leave you unsure... try to get him one on one and tell him listen I wanna be with you If your unsure or dont want to be with me I need to know so I can go find someone who knows what they want|`|tHFY2hg4aa	Just forget about him. He obviously isn't serious about you, but wants to keep you available for him. Just don't dwell on him because that is what he wants. Keep your eyes open for someone else to spend time with. I wouldn't waste time on someone who is a yo-yo.|`|KvBA8wS3aa	He is playing with you. If he was seriously into you he would be chasing you. Move on and find someone worthy of your affections.
sTqfKpbraa	yeah<br>  if you wont have about her ?<br>  then who else ?<br>  its okay<br>  you are attracted to her|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	YESS! its ok to have sexual thoughts about your crush. but try not to act upon them in front of her, while your not dating ;)|`|aaBWUx7Iaa	its all b'coz ur soo much attrected to her n she is ur girl friend so i dont think there is somthing wrong in it for u to have thoughts for her ... its all normal :)|`|BuGz6eU9aa	it happens, its called puberty and you'll have those thoughts|`|PCrh5bOMaa	lol you wouldnt be a male if you didnt have these thoughts!  Its all normal.  Even girls do it too ;-)|`|n6RRUxCDaa	im sorry that everyone has the same thoughts but i dont, i do but i stop myself... it is adultery in ones heart, thinking of someone in that maner is wrong.|`|dtOcTHRjaa	there's no problem 'bout that.<br>  it's a normal thing. you're just a man. you can't help that.|`|m1XLN0vSaa	That's alright mate.i wouldn't be able to go out with a girl with whom I am not sexually attracted to.You are on the right track|`|FzFSzilmaa	kissing isn't X-rated... :D|`|msoDXmvuaa	yes i broke up with my ex 5 years ago..and i still get off to her naked pics sometimes hahahaa true story ...im such a sick ****   hahahahah|`|B9jLDyC7aa	yes this is perfectly normal|`|2vgbJhlRaa	yes as long as your not mistaken for lust instead of love.|`|m2eHPeciaa	yes, it jus means ur straight.|`|SL1bsp4zaa	well.. most boys do have these thoughts.. just don't expect anything past making out or kissing too quickly.. make sure you discuss it with her before you try anything with her (if you intend to).. Be patient. Of course you're going to think things, just make sure you always respect her, and be a gentleman! :)|`|U3lxRnjnaa	It is common to have a crush and have x rated thoughts. Afterall we are human. Why dont you tell her your feeling and see what happen?|`|hPvXdd7raa	Your all good bro.<br>  <br>  Thats how sexual attractions work - makes you want to go further then the first step.|`|Bi51WJd7aa	Of course it is. I think everyone thinks that about at least one other person. It's awesome that you think that about someone REAL, that you seem to know and really like... Maybe she's your soulmate ;)
o8UiiPVCaa	THIS CRUSH AIN"T GOING AWAY. So you have to try. Speak up!<br>  <br>  Let that friend be a connection between the both of you. Let him introduce you to each other. From that you can start by being just friends and spend each other's company. Then you can both decide on whatever.<br>  <br>  What's the worst thing can ever happen? Take it or Leave it.|`|rev5Hrkraa	Ya girls you have a crush on are confusing you like them sooo much but you get scared of them I honestly think you should find some connection of your friend and try to sit by her at lunch or something idk really man its confusing try to talk to her up front maybe she still likes you and she'll get nervous.|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	I think that she might feel the same way. Just be really confident in front of her, she will grow to like you a-lot.|`|al6K48oSaa	You're a wuss!|`|LxOKTU7raa	being friends is cool|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	talk to her. Trust me if you're not going to talk to her she won't either. Think about it; what's teh worst that can happen? Worst thing is she just might talk a little. Nothing like "get out of my face you ugly one" will happen lol. good luck.|`|angW1Lkfaa	If you have a Hugh crush on this girl spit out the butterflies and talk to her. make friendly and fun.
8VlDuMFOaa	Ummmm...absolutely zero chance of that happening. They are an ex for a reason...they shouldnt be holidaying together.<br>  I can hear those alarm bells ringing all the way from Australia!|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	I`d make him Ex again.<br>  <br>  That is just beyond being reasonable if you are in a relationship.<br>  Makes you wonder if he is really divorced.|`|AA11108018	Sounds like him and the wife are still doing the dance|`|AA10776535	Oh he would be an ex really quick.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Depends on a lot of things.  If they have kids together it might be quite nice for both of them to have the kids and nice for the kids to have their parents both there, rather than missing one parent for the whole holiday.  <br>  <br>  As long as they were just friends and I was invited along I would be fine about it.<br>  <br>  If there were no kids involved or they were sharing a room I would be a little bit different about it|`|drEfr9waaa	If they're like Bruce Willis and Demi Moore I wouldn't worry about it but I would sure want to go along!!  Some exes are really good at maintaining civil relations after divorce.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	oh honey , I would make him a Holiday he wouldn't for get. then i would kick him close and all out the door.|`|yuTue84caa	I wouldn't let it happen or when he went away I would leave him, change my number and never speak to him again.|`|Q4lzLhIvaa	well we all have feelings 4 our ex partners our hearts are just like that, hell i still love my ex and want to get back with her but it will never happen. i wud suggest u leave the house before comes back|`|UYmRjCY9aa	i would be livid and he would be an x partner again|`|rUsFKFQ8aa	very uncomfortable|`|O7QyQl15aa	very angry!  Are there children involved...even then I would still be angry!|`|UUrazY5Zaa	totally disgraced to be honest, although i do not know the full extent of the situation.|`|w6dXWoPzaa	i will feel really jelous... i will be like he still like her... and it can screw up ma realtionship with him... i will never let him go|`|zqWKHbcmaa	uhh like it's divorce time|`|Ozk6a3Asaa	i feel like it is time to run far far away for him|`|TEevHtiAaa	umm maybe you are the third wheel then?|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	I'd end my relationship as soon as he packed his bags.
RZWiU7Jcaa	He needs to do ALOT of maturing ! There's no such thing as someone is confusing me he's acting like a dork if you need more then ask if he's not giving you more then that, Move on. Get a REAL man if you want a BOY then you keep that guy.|`|s5F745gBaa	Your in deeeeeeeeeeep water.<br>  Your BF is just as unsure you are. But I'm thinking your relationship isn't going to last long. Wait for a while ad see what happens.<br>  If you break up again, don't bother trying to be a couple again.<br>  Find a new guy.|`|5qdpmoTdaa	Sounds like a love bipolar.. maybe he is unsure of himself lately and if he isn't making you feel loved or like he is 100% wanting to give his all to you.. it's better to figure out the issues etc. early so you can figure out what to do early on in the relationship. The problems really only get worse. Good luck & Good thinking.
wfKtKlktaa	honestly theyre jsut really fun and its one of the few moments of our day where we have no worries|`|e93659642a9147aad2a89d7b0a52ebddaa	It gives us an outlet of expression for things that we can't do in everyday life. (Drive a car 200 MPH for example.)|`|Yg51SGlsaa	why do guys, GUYS??????<br>  <br>  AM I THE ONLY GIRL GAMER OUT THERE OFFENDED BY THIS??<br>  <br>  I'm a girl gamer and trust me it's just not guys that are video game obsessed. It's fun, I'm mostly a FPS gamer but lately i've been playing old school games and getting back in touch with my childhood games. Like tetris, pacman and Wacky Wheels.<br>  <br>  We obsess because.....well if you don't know why then your not really into games as much are you? Ok what do you do that you totally love and would never give up? reading? horse riding? the gym? well whatever it is, the way you feel about that is the way i feel about games.<br>  <br>  It's just Not guys that are obsessed it's Girls too!|`|738eb3523fcda7312e683aec70d06ce8aa	I love video games too, but I'm not obsessed with them, though there have been times I've become obsessed with certain games. Why do guys obsess over them? Well, the simple reason is because it's fun and they usually get really good at it, and want to keep improving. But is there a deeper underlying reason? I don't know really but here are some possible reasons. <br>  - Maybe, they find their personal lives dull in comparison to games which are constantly entertaining. It's just an escape from life.<br>  - Games are addictive by nature.<br>  - Maybe he plays online with the same people and has formed a bond/friendship with them (that happened to me), so you want to see and talk to your friends so you play more often.|`|qmL84hXXaa	I love video games too! I actually got my boyfriend into them....<br>  <br>  It's not a bad thing, as long as it doesn't take time away from the two of you being together. Actually, you could try playing them with him... there are some that are really fun. It could turn into an activity that you guys both enjoy. Win, win!|`|wNdB8Gjyaa	I don't know.<br>  <br>  I've always wondered why girl's bother having hobbies or interets myself, o.k, admittedly some of them (a lot) are just personality-less dolls.<br>  <br>  but for those rare deviants.<br>  <br>  *Edit: YEAH WACKY WHEELS that game is awesome.|`|mDBHMJPjaa	so do i and so does every male iv meat in his 30 and in a relationship i guess its like our time and our time only. :]]
qHMBkLx2aa	Hood *****:<br>  <br>  A black male from the projects/ghetto, who won't die for his turf and colors but greatly respects them and acts as if he's a gangsta. He has no sense of speaking correct english, wearing his pants around his waste, or ever taking off the "new" tags of his old hat. These individuals will usually have their entire life savings rolled up in their sock.<br>  <br>  Edit: I ask myself the same thing. You wouldn't think women would be attracted to men with absolutely no ambition.|`|7ko9czaaaa	i don,t understand much more then you do, i thank in the hood means a g,,
kbkbDhwLaa	Yes, you are wasting your time. Why pursue a man that obviously is not interested in a relationship, when that is what you want? He doesn't want an attachment and you do. You both want completely different things. Even if you did get in a relationship with him at some point, it'd be a safe assumption to say that it wouldn't last and he would flake out.<br>  <br>  Btw, just for future reference, it's intimate, not intimidate.
uqwL9544aa	Well I would use it on trolly tokens and cheap meals.<br>  <br>  This can last me for about a week or two.|`|eAIapfXsaa	20 dollars is nothing. I spent that much on food today. <br>  <br>  I have an online business that gives me passive income, which means I get paid even if I don't work. It's great. I have plenty of money to spend on food and whatever. <br>  <br>  Yeah it really does suck not to have an income. That sucks really hard. That's why it was so important for me to work on this online business. Now I basically don't have to worry about money. This year I'm going to make a new web site and make like ten times more money. It's really great when you don't have to worry about money and you can just go pop into the market anytime and buy whatever food you want.|`|2h4eetekaa	beer|`|xWUqzPOWaa	save it!|`|aAUeWJ5laa	snacks. totally. xD|`|ctSmc7UAaa	Gas money!|`|g1ciF3DVaa	i'd buy a shirt =]|`|w6dXWoPzaa	eat pizza
d0EyXi6paa	i think sumtimes it cud be telepathy, sumtimes ppl juz feel u<br>  <br>  and sometimes it is a coincidence.<br>  <br>  but it doesnt matter if its telepathy or coincidence, as long as you satisfy that thought and come in contact with them.|`|7JQDQJe0aa	stop asking stupid questions|`|AA11441704	They do..........it is all the same..........
3qaXA0oBaa	hmmm maybe it has something to do with the boyfriend. just a minor detail.....nice one. try treating people like human beings and maybe they will do the same for you.|`|Iqco1PcQaa	you not no how works life, better you dunt no|`|9bdEPcWIaa	Because he is a decent guy and you're still living with your b/f.|`|umGi6gTcaa	Maybe he's getting sick of waiting for you to break up with your bf. In his mind you don't want to be with him as much as you said because your taking too long. He said he would date you when you break up with your bf, your still with your bf so he's not gonna ask you out on a date again until you do, Duh.<br>  <br>  <br>  Or maybe he realized that you're a skanky cheater who will only do the same to him when you meet someone better.<br>  <br>  BTW he tells you to call him because you would do it when you could talk, not when your bf is around. He was playing it safe for you.|`|CqJ1UQWiaa	Obviously you like the new guy much more. All i can say it break up with your current boyfriend first then worry about the new guy later. What you're doing now is wrong and considered to be cheating. <br>  <br>  to answer your question, its apparent the new guy's into you. As to why he doesn't call you, no one really knows. Why don't u ask him yourself? Maybe he doesn't want to call you or talk to you as much because the fact is, you still DO have a boyfriend. Until then, he doesn't want to get too close.|`|ghvU8CsOaa	You serious about that? Are you just gonna drop your current bf? I swear you'll have hang ups when you get to be with the new guy. (if ever)<br>  <br>  Don't leave someone just because you -like- someone else. Feelings do change from day to day. You're not even sure if that new guy likes you.|`|TZ1Z2nhhaa	Dont start you'l never stop|`|RZWiU7Jcaa	Not a great way to start something new, Maybe he got cold feet once he knew there was a 3rd person. Next time be free to date and not have the 3rd wheel.|`|ai76o21qaa	boooooooooty call|`|vJlZzv2Eaa	call him
sIareS2Vaa	From what you've said, DEFINITELY. I'll use myself as an example...<br>  <br>  There's a girl I work with (who used to work at the mall actually...haha) who I like alot. When she first was hired, I wanted to find out who she was, so I asked around and found out as much as I could *your guy knew stuff about you already*. I then made an extra effort to talk to her to get her attention and took my break when she did *your guy made small talk with you, then came over and ate lunch with you the next day*. I'll also admit, when I know she's working, I walk by and look for her to see what she's up to. I think its like that with both guys and girls where if you have a crush on them you want to see them as much as possible. *your guy stares at your store*. He likes you.<br>  <br>  Do you like him? If you do, flirt with him a little. That makes it even more fun (for you both). We tease each other at work constantly and I have a hard time not thinking about her, which I guess is why i'm here right now...but if everything you say is true, you can be sure he'll react positively if you do a little flirting.|`|2pxGPcxaaa	He does like you. He remembered what you wore the day before, he was obviously checking you out.|`|cbt4I1cuaa	come on its obvious this guy is going crazy over you he is just shy next time ask him something just to break the ice if your interested

e2NOLDGxaa	When she said she's extremely nervous because she never has had dinner with anyone alone before, it's because she just is nervous. I don't think it has any hidden message in it, it seems pretty straightforward. So no, it doesn't mean she likes you. It's just like when bungee jumping for the first time. You ARE bound to be nervous, right?<br>  <br>  Just smile, be you (you don't want her falling in love with someone who is not really who you are) and try to be modest. Talk about interesting stuff.|`|441002ba222c31246fd283fc8f2694bfaa	Being bi has nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  If she is nervous then yes. She is afraid she will do something stupid in front of you, and she cares about what you think, there is a good sign she likes you.
ptDHZK7Jaa	wow it must have been a huge huge fight cause i wouldnt ever think of hittin my bf for anythin stupid talk to him and tell him u r sorry and promise him u will never hurt him again because it could become a violent relationship talkin will b the best thing and treat him better not any guy will stay by ur side if u do dat<br>  <br>  oh yeah great make up sex dress in somethin super sexy in his favorite color him him the best ******** take him out to a romantic dinner just dont become his slave|`|h5p9exIDaa	Hi Betty,<br>   Geez!!! Must of been a real fight then... Usually the man will do the hitting first...That shows him,that when you get up set and Mad you become abuses woman...You really need to Learn how to control your temper,or you may in the future lose him for good...<br>    Make a nice dinner(things he likes)put candles out on the dinner table,wear something sexy that will drive him Crazy...After you have dinner,tell him something good is waiting in the bedroom for him...Grab his hand and lead him to your bedroom and show him just how much you are SORRY for slapping him..Plus you really need to tell him in words how SORRY you are for the slap too...<br>  Your Friend,<br>  poppy1|`|SBXmPn9saa	Do not be that stupid that is abusive you know he must report what you done so bad not so funny,to the police. I am sorry to ask, are you tombish?|`|Jnv47zQgaa	HAHA|`|0O6jbsSZaa	you should be in jail for domestic violence,,,,,,, if a man lost his temper. and hit you, every one would hate him and put HIM in jail. becuse he has a penis, and is a male, and is stronger.... and if you had bruises.... ohh boy,, that man would be in jail for a long time you low grade scum.<br>  <br>  . but YOU hit a guy, and give him bruises... and people are all easy on you... you belong in jail., as a lesson to women out there,, they need to know that there is still SOME kind of punishment for hitting a male (who is almost deffently far stronger the any women, what-ever his size)|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	wow.. U should feel really bad fact that u gave him a slap and u HIT a guy..<br>  I would feel real bad if i ever hit a guy no matter what he did to me..<br>  Anyways, if he started the fight and u know for sure it is his Fault then don't show him ur sorry..<br>  <br>  but if u started it or both of u r wrong u should show him ur sorry, apologize for what u did..tell him u don't knwo what got in to u and all that..<br>  try to make it up to him, cook him dinner or something nice..<br>  <br>  Good luck..|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	You have cheapened yourself and almost certainly caused him to lose respect for you. You hit someone who you knew wouldn't hit back and that is just as bad a guy who beats a woman. You will have to learn to control your anger. What will happen if you have kids and one of them really makes you angry? Will they go to school with black eyes too?|`|56XwyVW9aa	Do not open up this can of worms! Tell him that you are very sorry and that it will NEVER happen again. Ask him what can you do to make it up to him.<br>  <br>  He might make you eat a little crow since, he will look silly if he explains to his friend's what happened!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|AUcPY9Veaa	of course you will feel guilty about it.'cause your the one who did that and just say sorry to him.|`|WIurOBbDaa	Just tell him in person and try to make it up to him...|`|p59ib3FIaa	LOL ROFL XD you slaped the **** out of him|`|dat8eoYyaa	wow that's so sad, i would feel so bad that it even got that far :( u better apologize  A LOT !|`|K1wxsMkBaa	I have been in a similar situation. My (now ex) husband told me to hit him and I did. After I did, I wanted to every time we fought. Its a slippery slope.<br>  <br>  Please be careful. Once you cross the line of physical violence (no matter how small) you are far more likely to cross it again with that person (no matter how sorry you are). <br>  <br>  I suggest trying to walk away when things get heated and give your self time to calm down. When you are calm its easier to talk about your issues rationally. But I know that is easier said than done. So if you can't then try shouting at each other from different rooms. Argue in text back and forth or on the phone. Do something to keep your self apart physically while arguing.<br>  <br>  In your defense - he DID literally ask for it. Don't beat your self up about it. You can't change the past. But please please realize that you have the capacity to get physical with him (which you have now proven to both him and your self) and be very cautious in the future.|`|c262d111757062147659cfb290f765b6aa	Wow all these people are mean!  I have been hit in the past and i have remembered it ever since.  I am sure he understands that you are sorry.  You say your sorry constantly correct? that gets the point home if u just say it casually like oh sry my bad type thing then i think he wouldn't believe it but i know that tempers rage and i am sure he understands that too..  i honestly don't think u need to do anything but just let it go and not try to bring it up to stir up any tempers.|`|faiqPeWDaa	It is never ok to hit anybody, ever.  He has forgiven you, and you can't change the past, so just move on.  That said, if you ever do it again  you need to get help for your anger and impulse control.  I think if it were a guy hitting a girl everyone would instantly say the girl should leave.  I'm not sure why a girl hitting a guy should be any different really, but that is the person's decision.|`|OoNeyVAoaa	big mistake!..just tell him what you would want to hear if he would of been the one that slapped you and don't ever do it again you did too huge mistakes there..1st telling him you don't love him and the obvious one slapping him i mean imagine if he would of slapped u back.. or what if he would of told you he doesn't love you.. remember relationships are based on respect when u loose respect for one another there is no point..|`|tHFY2hg4aa	I can't really condone you hitting him, but he did ask for it after all, literally. So, just forget about it. Apparently he has decided to. He probably feels like an idiot as well.<br>  A word of advice, and I know it's none of my business, don't get married as long as the two of you act like this. The "fight and make up" thing doesn't keep working forever.|`|Kd3GRiLyaa	wow thats mean you shouldnt put your hands on anyone because you never know how they will take it or if they will end up beating you. you should really try anything to show him youre sorry and maybe you should take him out for ice cream or something cute and fun to get your minds off it. hahahaha yes ice cream i know sounds lame so do anything fun not too serious:)|`|11SCey7Xaa	Violence isn't the answer to having fights with your boyfriend. Your just very lucky that is have forgiven you or he could of pressed charges. You feel bad, but not forever, you have made a mistake, learn from what you have done and move on. Good Luck! - can you please answer my question. Thanks!|`|Xi2lGjKyaa	i am so sorry to hurt u i am so angry that day i cant control my anger<br>  i know it hurt u but sory in cry in nite think the mistake i done to u pls forgive me|`|kbkbDhwLaa	You should never lay your hands on someone else. You need to control your temper. Even though he forgave you for it, it still doesn't make it right.|`|s5F745gBaa	Yes, of course. You two have forgiven each other, and I guess the fight was to relase tension about something.|`|oyr13KYmaa	You should feel like an idiot.  Leaving him will show him you are sorry, if you don't, it will surely happen again.|`|al6K48oSaa	HAHAHHAHAH WHAT A PUSSY! GOT A BLUE EYE FROM A SLAP. HAHAHAHA. KNOCK HIM OUT HUN!|`|nFOllgtDaa	Wow what was the arguement about??|`|Lr3jIkYWaa	He's a guy he should deal with it. He asked for it anyway did his face look like this |`|VC51Wnxwaa	is your boyfriend a ******?|`|du5MNrQ6aa	wow...what a *****.|`|0KXJ8UjIaa	well if he has truly forgiven you, then he's a really smart and good guy. now what u need to do is apologize to him face to face, and let him know u know u were wrong and you are sorry and u don't want it to happen again. talk about why u were fighting, and find a better way to solve it. if you are willing to end 3 years of a relationship over one fight, then that's really messed up. that's why we have so many divorces these days--people are too immature and lazy to solve problems the smarter way. just apologize and talk to him and let him know|`|Ci2Q77E0aa	well..you should feel a bit guilty because you did hit him..but it's the past. Tell him you feel really bad about it and ask how you can make it up. You guys were in a heat of moment (no puns intended) and it happened because of it. Next time, he should say stuff like that and you shouldn't take the offer.. best luck to you|`|0gYFiYv0aa	this is a worse thing which u did to him...if u really love him then no matter how much u fight with him u shouldnt slap or hit him its nice to know that how much u have love for him in ur heart that even u can hit him....shame on u|`|yHYpesK6aa	u smacked a guy and gave him a mark by his eye. damn girl. but anyway, he had forgiven u so, be cool about it.|`|AA10090963	feel like a dumbass|`|LxOKTU7raa	yess|`|r4Yi3dFXaa	hey.....in my opinion he asked for it... i wouldnt feel bad at all<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD JOB...<br>  <br>  =)|`|hA6JDWsFaa	great make up sex 'cause you basically effed up realllll baad.|`|QwXIsKAhaa	wooooo intense. the dude got ***** slap. ahaaha<br>  ummm just talk to him?

Good Luck|`|lXBVrik7aa	People can be like that a lot! Sometimes they just say things like that to be mean, almost never because it is the truth. Sometimes (yes, this is really shallow), girls will say that other people are ugly to: a) make people feel bad. b) Because the person is unpopular. c) because their friends do not like this person so they want to "fit in" by making fun of him.<br>  Hope I helped ;)<br>  P.S. Girls who say you are ugly are just mean people, If they judge you by your looks they are pathetic and immature. Some people are just like that, but I guarantee that there are people out there that would either think you are cute or not care if you are ugly.<br>  GL :)|`|scyLaz0saa	High school was terrible for me.  I used to get similar responses from guys.  But then I went to college and discovered who I was there.  Now I am decent looking and have a killer personality.  I also have guys lined out down the block.    I think you will enjoy college.  People are more adult like in every way that matters.  Plus it is much easier to meet and talk with the opposite sex.  It is different than high school.  So have fun and good luck to you.  Just remember to get involved while there. :)|`|uO66crWSaa	Don't believe that you are ugly, you must proud and grateful because God's give you a beautiful life.

I would like to say  that I am a girl!|`|PbPiF2p3aa	Either you are insecure or they have some issues. To be honest many girls find the rough or "ugly" guy attractive. Kinda makes them interesting. High school girls are inmature. Dont let them make you feel bad about yourself. Blow them off and look for a girl with some substance.|`|C1PQhkUxaa	Please don't listen to some of the answers you're getting. People are really rude.<br>  <br>  High school girls can be really harsh. I became homeschooled just to avoid that factor so I can already say that I admire you for sticking with it.<br>  <br>  Any girl that deserves you will love you for who you are.|`|VC51Wnxwaa	take a hint|`|nLeJJ5nMaa	plastic surgery. you only live once, might as well look good/feel good.|`|Jqmyxmboaa	I cant even begin to believe that these girls would have the nerve to say that kind of stuff out loud. who does that? that's really childish...i'm sure the maturity begins with college. for now just try to ignore it...
W0633l18aa	I think she should give the father an ultimatum he either stays in her childs life or gets the hell out<br>  <br>  if he decides to stay out she should not let him see her kid because him being so careless and idnifferent to his child is just gonna cause the kid pain and he should be kept away <br>  <br>  maybe being forced to choose will kick some long lost paternal feelings in motion

You probably need some counseling if you've been brow beaten by this woman for 30 years.<br>  I don't think the money has anything to do with anything.  If she treats you poorly, your having more or less money than her would not change anything.|`|AA12346188	If I answer your question, it becomes one way and it is not logical.<br>  Please let her speak to me about you and why she is behaving like that.<br>  Then I can give a proper answer.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	if she makes more than you, you could get alimony in a divorce|`|uq9KBBPNaa	i have a quote for u ....."You use to have handle of Your life, Now it is broken"|`|d3eab5726a0f9f49c756fdcdee1a6bc5aa	Is there any need of any argument after 30 years when both could understand each other well ? She has some very good qualities but she is misusing them against you instead of helping you. A wife of those  qualities can be very much useful for you if she uses them positively for the family. She couldn't understand the real meaning of a wife & you too couldn't make her understand. A  husband & a wife MUST be co-operative to each other irrespective of their qualities, good or bad. You are simpler than her which is costing you. It is a horrible idea to think of separation after so many years. Both of you need counselling & thorough medical check up too. She is less God fearing than you, it seems. Success is NOT measured by wealth alone. Whether she is sincere to the relation, sweet & soft, positive, polite & co-operative or not, but be so anyway. Instead of arguing, try to be quiet in most of cases to avoid the deterioration of situation. It is not necessary for a spouse to win in all domestic differences rather, having tension free peaceful life is more important.<br>  I'm sorry to say that both of you couldn't understand the real meaning, definition, basic concept & purpose of  becoming  a husband & a  wife of someone & bothered only about false egoes.|`|pOCabUMvaa	It takes 50/50 for an argument. You both are at fault here for arguing and not talking., or communicating.<br>  <br>  She probably feels the same way about you, finding it difficult to break away from the marriage.<br>  <br>  You made a mistake by helping her create wealth of her own?? When you were "creating" that wealth, did you both not come to an agreement, on weather to share that wealth, if not, that was your own fault.<br>  <br>  Oh, yes, she feels more empowered now, because the wealth is all hers, because you did not communicate with her on her sharing her wealth once she got it.<br>  <br>  She is far better off than you because you are no longer the problem, guilty feelings, feelings of sadness, and shoulda, coulda, wuddas.<br>  <br>  I think you should get a backbone and find out what you did to make her wealthy, and do the same for you.<br>  <br>  Where there is a will, there is a way.|`|F4kFUxd1aa	R u uncomfortable because she is making more money than you or is it because her success has influenced this new personality or is it both? I think that she should be grateful for what you helped her accomplish and not use it to her advantage but at the same time this problem is minor to throw away 30 years of marriage. Y now? If you can't have a discussion without an argument, there is always a counsellor then maybe you can decide whether or not the marriage is worth saving.|`|djUMvICoaa	It''s always the unknown that we are afraid of.  After 30 years of what you have gone through you are lacking the self esteem to try it, to prove to yourself that you can do it.  30 years of what you have gone through is enough has shaken your confidence that you are worth even saving, or that anybody else will see you any better than your wife.  You won't know any different until you try or else you can look forward to more of what you already have.|`|675390202407ced9223dcc6b917599d2aa	Did you feel this way before she became financially independent?  After being the provider for so long, you may be having feelings of inadequacy and lowered self esteem now that she is "better off than you".  You may need some therapy to help you deal with not being "the provider" anymore.|`|Ieq0zzdeaa	Woman wants an educated, trained, well established, with income, with strong body, with clean body, having no other woman, only interested in the woman he has got and must appreciate and enjoy her company and only then the man can get some value in the house.|`|DTN6Vg8caa	ok i guess ur well above 55 3/4 in hell will it make a diff|`|WwrCYF1kaa	You've given very little to go on except to say that you are not happy in your marriage.<br>  <br>  That you have ensured that your wife has her own income and seems to be doing rather well for herself was not a mistake but an admirable thing to do.<br>  <br>  If you are worried that you are not the main bread winner in the family, don't. Few women worry about this, yet often the burden of providing for the family falls to them. Choosing to be a mother and play second fiddle to your husbands career is not easy. It's hard to have two careers in a family when those careers may take you in very different directions.<br>  <br>  Seems like the partnership element of your relationship is missing. before you decide to leave try counceling. Only you know if you are too scared to move on. You need to move on, with or without your wife. Stagnation is not a choice.|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	I think you sound like a very decent man, and this woman has used you for her own gains to some extent. But are you absolutely sure you're not still in love with each other? Lots of couples go through some rough patches, especially after 30 years! Is she sharing her success with you? Or making you feel left behind? I think this is definitely the root of the problem. You're starting to feel somewhat of a failure. Don't allow her to make you feel like this, you started out in this marriage as partners, why should that change just because she has made some money? You're still equals in this relationship. You both need to sit down and work out what you both want out of this.|`|Wqx0Yjgxaa	Ouch! 30 years? It depends on your age, really. If... Your too... you know... old, if you break, you might be alone. If your not afraid to live alone, then go ahead. BUT, give her some more time.

Sometimes I'll be up in our bedroom and she'll be downstairs on the computer for a couple hours and I miss her.<br>  So if he does have feelings for you, then you going away that long would crush him.<br>  <br>  Just tell him how you feel.  Believe me..  Most of us guys are absolutely retarded to catching on.  And if he's like me, which I doubt (but who knows), he's terrified to tell you how he feels because you may reject him.  So he'd prefer to remain friends than risk losing you.  So do the both of you a favor and just tell him.  Don't hint.  Hinting is the worst thing in the world!  Because no matter how obvious you make it, he'll always question it.  <br>  <br>  So just tell him!  Avoid missing out on being together for the next few months.

o28iO6FKaa	Hi luv,<br>           2 be honest, ur friendship wont be the same again anyway. Even if you hadn't told him how you felt. That's because he has another girl in his life and that changes everything with how he acts with you and the time spent with you. You know yourself, you wouldn't let him be best friends with another girl right. So his current girlfriend will probably be the same. If he has morals and respect for you both, he wouldn't be with you as much anyway. Its a hard thing to have happen but its your pride that's probably hurt the most at the moment. It will pass, and you will find that you end up with a different sort of friendship with him or them both. No less meaning full but its just shifting into another phase. You will be fine girl. There is a special fella out there Just waiting for someone like you. Chin up and get out there huny. Live life and be happy that your mate has found someone who he is happy with.  Ask yourself.... Would you be happier if he was sad?<br>  <br>  Hope this is of some help luv.<br>  You never know what the future holds.<br>  <br>  Stay safe.|`|tYnpVHpZaa	you are a *****|`|VC51Wnxwaa	tl;dr NO

b8QM7NY6aa	Hi guess what? i was in your shoes about 2 years ago, i have a child myself a 18 month baby girl, i know that it is scary especially when you're in school, yes your parents will be disappointed but they will be more proud of you for taking responsibility for your actions. Abortion is definitely not a good option because in the long run there will be consequences and regrets. It's obvious that you two love each other and your baby so my suggestions are:<br>  1. Let her stay at home for a year to get a lot of rest and time with the baby coz she'll need it.<br>  2. You continue with your studies so that you can be able to provide for both of them, like the good guy i sense you are.<br>  3.  Try to make the whole process easier for her by understanding that most of her mood swings will be caused by the pregnancy, it's not that you annoy or irritate her but it's that the baby wants her all to him/herself.<br>  4. Try to satisfy all of her cravings as long as they are healthy for both her and the baby.<br>  5. Try to remain calm all the time as babies can be irritating.<br>  REMEMBER: children grow up fast and before you know it he/she is calling you daddy and that to anyone is music to their ears.<br>  SO RELAX IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD BUT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW LIFE ;)|`|2JzJDDEpaa	you're both so young!!! and by the sounds of things have an amazing future ahead of both of you, with university, and any career you would want. talk to both your parents before you make any rash decisions, but i do strongly recommend an abortion.<br>  my friend had her child when she was 16, and i hardly see her. she is unable to come out anymore because she always has to look after her baby boy. i know its a bag thing, but i really dont think a child at 16 is ideal, for the baby's sake. wait until you have money to support yourselves.<br>  <br>  just make sure you talk to both your parents first making any decisions<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  xxx|`|KIFCZpeKaa	I'm very impressed by how amazingly mature you are being about this, however your decision shouldn't be based on either of your parents' views or opinions as its not their life or choice, it is yours and your girlfriend's.<br>  <br>  although having a baby at 16 isn't the end of the world it will bring an end to a lot of things, bring on the responsibility and all that! but you may find that once having a baby college isn't possible, at least not for both of you but you will still have time to sort that out after the baby is born if you do decide to keep it.<br>  <br>  although asking questions on here can be reassuring don't take anyones answer too seriously (especially the nasty ones) as no-one really knows your situation and your decision should be entirely down to you.<br>  <br>  i know several people who have had children your age and even younger and are happy now, one of the nicest, happiest children i know was born to a 15 year old - he is now 5 years old and although she didn't stay with the father of her child she is now living alone with her son and happy.<br>  <br>  regardless of your decision your attitude towards this is amazing and i am sure that whatever happens you can work through this and come out ok the other end.<br>  <br>  best of luck to you both/all|`|VqGoxxlQaa	Always be honest with yourself, each other and your family. <br>  Also these days... there are more opinions, the further you take your education.

VLsmKhVNaa	oh i was the exact same way .. i mooned over a guy for two years before realizing he was just using me and it'd never be a happily-ever-after fairytale. i finally let go after i found out he was talking to a bunch of different girls, telling them the same sappy love stuff he told me and using them the same way. i thought i was special because i was always there for him, but i guess to ppl like that it doesn't matter. as long as they get theirs. i'm just lucky i realized now so i don't have to degrade myself anymore. all my friends and family saw what he was doing to me except me. and i don't think i'll ever really stop loving him. i still want to see him. so much. but i can't let myself, it just shows my weakness. i think it's the same with you hun. and getting with other ppl doesn't help really. you just have to want to be treated better and loved the way you deserved. you sound like a really nice person, you don't want to be treated this way. no one does.

This may have made him wonder what was the point of the relationship to begin with if you've already started flirting with other men (I'm not saying that you have been).<br>  <br>  Finally it could be just plain jealously lol.

xvxtQwV5aa	pay attention to where her eyes look. do they stay on you the whole time or are they constantly shifting in the same direction. Not even constantly, if she looks in the same direction more than 2x turn around and ask her what's catching her eye. if she stutters to answer, then she's trying to make someone jealous because either she still has feelings for them (ex) or she wants to appear better than someone (girl she can't stand). also, if she's being a little toooo friendly or being really flirt and has shifty eyes, save yourself the trouble, cuz she's using you|`|QknNNaT6aa	Its very hard to decifer if the girl is just playing with you (either for attention, getting back at an ex or guy, or just plain flirty, mean or slutty) and unless you actually know each other she may be just using you.|`|QM1zBFj6aa	some girls are just teases. i know at least five that i am friends with that do that kinda stuff to me even when my gf is around me|`|VRipScGTaa	yea they do|`|p5LdqYeKaa	yea, when i work as store counter... they want free drinks and discounts.........|`|qlaZpHnPaa	They make comments about their mom laying out panties for them.|`|nLeJJ5nMaa	take it for what it is and dont get emotionally involved. just play along. ignore her a little and she may even try harder to get yer attention.|`|D0ShtJJJaa	If they hit you and say omg you are like so funny lol<br>  you should be able to suspect what they are up to if they've never done that kind of thing before to you!<br>  Also try and tell a really lame joke and see if she pretends to laugh|`|kbkbDhwLaa	Of course they do.

Your brain sometimes goes into overdrive and you can get nerovus but as long as you are with the right person then normally you are fine. <br>  It depends what sort of person you are, everyone can react differently to kissing a guy, depending (again) if it is the right one, or someone that you like rather then a drunk kiss...which really doesnt affect me at all! <br>  Hope this helps|`|kbkbDhwLaa	Kissing is probably the best part of the deal. I know some people will gasp at saying such a thing, but I personally think so. It's a peaceful and quiet moment. More sensual rather than animalistic.

The most precious gift a woman can give to a man is her body. A woman understands how valuable she is and she will love and respect herself for this reason.<br>  <br>  Most of us have been there, when we've found a man we really loved and wished we saved ourselves for him. Why? Because a lady understands union between a man and a woman goes deeper than just sex.<br>   <br>  I'm saying this, because a woman uses her mind for love and if giving a man sex satisfys her mind, she's happy temporarily. I think casual sex is disgusting and sluttish. Why would anyone want random sex with different people? Especially in today's world with uncurable diseases, unwanted pregnancies, etc.?<br>  <br>  I think she would also be a cheat, but it's not neccessarily. But why trust someone who is accustomed to casual sex. She likes the excitement and she will soon get bored with you, especiallly if she's cheated on her ex-husband.. Not boyfriend, but husband. That should tell you alot about her character, no matter the situation of her marriage.<br>  <br>  If she say's she wants to put it all behind her, take her word for it, but be cautious. Something was painful within her that made her turn to these men, and maybe she's healing and wants to change her ways. But putting things behind her only means, don't ever bring it up or remind her of what a slut she was. <br>  <br>  The key word is change. If she says she wants to change then I would say give her a shot, everyone makes mistakes. Especially, if you see her making alot of effort. Is she getting the churches help? Praying on it? Recieving counseling?<br>  <br>  It may very well not be that serious, but don't be a feadle to her game. You can't afford possibly contracting diseases behind her. Find a decent girl who will make you wait for her and if your a decent man you will wait. That's wifey material.|`|angW1Lkfaa	Emily<br>  Sorry  love but you need help<br>  <br>  You can't quit popping pills and you don't think your addicted. You don't think you need to you just want to.  Listen to your self.Right now you need to talk, you parents right now is your best bet, they can get you the help you need. I spent most of the 70's stoned. I got away from the environment and slowly stopped drugs, alcohol<br>  I know for a fact that you stop taking pills and you will replace it with something else. The only way you can stop is to be detoxified. Look at your question and tell your self your ok, you can't do it. You need to tell your parents and you need to do it now, You need to go into treatment, It's the only way you can't do this on your own  .|`|qIM2LtVzaa	if she was willing to cheat when she was married she knew it was f***** up. what would stop her from cheating on you? I wouldn't classify her in a slutty category because if a guy did the casual sex thing it would be cool.|`|K1wxsMkBaa	Think about this: People, in general,  tend to repeat behaviors they view as "rewarding" while we discontinue behavior that we view as "unrewarding". <br>  <br>  What are/were her rewards for casual sex and cheating? Sex in itself without commitment? Feelings of being accepted and loved?<br>  <br>  In my opinion, I think she can be honestly wanting to put it in her past if she has found being with you more rewarding. It depends on what her motivation for those behaviors was in the first place and if you fill those needs.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would start digging in and asking questions. Find out about the feelings behind the actions. Did she have a bad relationship but still need the physical closeness? Could she just not find one partner she viewd as worth while? Perhaps you can figure out what motivates her and what motivated those behaviors. By identifying her motives you will get a clearer view of her true intentions with you now.<br>  <br>  Guard your bank account for a while and see if she stays true. (Some) Women will say what you want to hear to get what they want.<br>  <br>  Does she have a lot of guy friends that call or text? If so she may be "keeping her options open". <br>  <br>  Pay attention to her behavior and note any sudden changes (any new behavior out of her usual day to day activities and changes in appearance). That is the single biggest indicator of cheating.|`|faiqPeWDaa	I don't think you should judge her by having casual sex, if she is a single women she has every right in the world to do as she pleases.   I do agree that the cheating however is a different story, and as past behaviour is an indicator of future behaviour you would be right to be concerned about her being faithful.|`|e97vt0Slaa	Casual sex doesnt make a woman a slut. If she's single and not tied down by a boyfriend or husband, it should be ok. As long as she is safe and not doing it with a taken man...then she would be a slut.<br>  <br>  Her cheating in the past... Doesnt nessesarily mean she will do it to you. But it depends on how mature she was at the time and the reasons she did it.|`|cYZ56kAAaa	casual sex is not a big deal. if someone wants to be faithful they will. even if they've cheated in the past. i do think too much casual sex can be a bad thing, but it's pretty common. however that doesn't mean she couldn't be loyal to somebody.|`|PbPiF2p3aa	The best way to predict the future is to look at the past. History does in fact repeat itself. Most women I know who have casual sex usually have casual affairs to. I am being blunt but if she cheated on her husband then....|`|38VeNgjtaa	im a man and even I know that once a cheater, always a cheater.

7a6cacb48cdcca129952d4a44b247d85aa	Dennis, <br>  <br>  I think you are angry because you had expectations of this women which have been let down or deflated. Anger will in turn move to upset and possibly resentment unless you do something to change the situation or alternatively change your perspective.<br>  <br>  I think the issue is not to do with her it's to do with you.  What i mean is what can you accept and what will you never accept ? <br>  <br>  It is not about HER being wrong by doing various things, and for academic purposes you could argue all day long about whether she was wrong or right to do what she did when she did it. I don't think it is going to make any difference. I think you say this.<br>  <br>  One positive is that she is talking about it and is aware of what is going on, but is she really repentant or is that really to placate you ?<br>  If you are not doing so already you need to let her talk freely, and say what is really going on for her.  This may allow her to get to the source of what motivated her to do these things. It could be feelings of inadequacy, insecurity, revenge, worthlessness, may be one of these, multiple of these, something else etc. <br>  <br>  If she can get to the source of why she acted like this and put in powerful reasons why not to do it then there is a good chance there will not be a repeat. The source may not be easy to get to it could for example be some childhood events. <br>  <br>  Additionally, it sounds like you are a young man and I think you have many other relationship options. So what I think you need to work out is:<br>  <br>  a) what are mandatory qualities of someone you are in a relationship with<br>  b) what are desirable qualities of someone you are in a relationship with<br>  c) what are deal breakers that will always stop you from being in a relationship with some person<br>  d) what are the qualities that you would not your potential partner to exhibit and would give you concerns.<br>  <br>  Try and take the chemistry that you have with this person out of the equation for a few minutes while you work this out.  In other words can you commit to this person without the chemistry. i.e. would she meet the job description of partner.<br>  <br>  Essentially (A) and (C) give you minimum criteria, (B) and (D) give you more supporting information.<br>  <br>  On that basis you need to make a choice and if necessary a compromise.  However if you are making a compromise you are choosing to do so and you need to accept her for what she is and isn't.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, much love to you ;-)|`|fR2Geezcaa	Your angry because you believed her to be one person and found out she is another. Keep in mind she would not be the person she is today if it was not for her past. <br>  <br>  All you can do is hope that she has changed and would not lie to you or cheat on you if your involved with her. The odds are not in your favor of her making a complete turn around but there is a chance she has learned from her mistakes. <br>  <br>  Unless she begins to give you reasons to not trust her you need to believe she has changed and not hold her past against her.|`|6uJWQI03aa	Sometimes you have to judge someone from their past. if she really wanted to change she wouldn't bring all that bullcrap up. move on, you're feeling angry because she's a ****...|`|loqsl5xXaa	Maybe you are scared that she will try it on you. Maybe you haven't let your guard down yet and worried that she may do something while she is with you. Maybe you worry that she wont take your relationship as serious as you. <br>  <br>  talk to her about all this. You can't rest until you do. your mind wont rest till u do. be honest like she has been and make sure you both are on the same page. make sure you set down rules that you both have to follow.. make sure you continue to have an open communication with each other.|`|cVcSjiBDaa	We should not judge anyone, that is correct, but if you don't see any remords and repentance, and see that she is changing her behavior, do you still want to be around that person? ussually you get along well with people who shares your same principles, customs, or values. I have a friend who I love dearly, but I don't like how she lives, then I don't hang out with her. And definitely I wont ask her for any advice. I am still available if she needs to talk or if I can give her some advice, but I always make sure I am honest with her and tell her what she does is not right. And she is changing a lot.|`|7gHnVJpyaa	Make her pay for her choices -<br>  <br>  Leave her over the bald-bouncer thing.<br>  <br>  Let's face it, you'll never get that image out of your head, will you? I'm not even sure I will...<br>  <br>  Actually no, forget I said that (couldn't resist...) If you really think it could work out with her, then give it a chance, she's trying to be honest with you. But I'd play this one very cautiously, trust and commitment is obviously a hard thing for her to manage in relationships.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	So it's not that she slept with her husband or other lover, but the fact that there was a bald muscular bouncer somehow upsets you.

As for the affairs she's had, it's unfortunate that she did those things, but it is called the past for a reason.|`|kA1mYSOtaa	Well, Dennis, the truth is that the past does tend to repeat itself quite often and effectively; however, I find that my life is much easier when I bottom-line a woman's actions. That tells you all that you need to know, and I would say that that is what you should do in this case. I know that she hasn't always been June Cleaver, but monitor her actions and attitude toward you. Make sure that what she does toward you actually raise her interest in you and yours in her. She should be making you feel good about yourself and your relationship. If she is not, it is likely that she does not respect you and thus you should avoid having your heart handed to you for dinner. I wish you luck.

Jf5h5OPCaa	You shouldn't steal someones girlfriend away from them, that's just wrong. I used to like this boy so so so much, but I never bothered because he always had a girlfriend. One day like a year later, he finally asked me out when he was single. So if you and this girl are meant to be, it will happen. As for now, look for someone new, and leave their relationship be.
WnLLU2Jlaa	Give her , her space, sometimes girls need space when your being to smothering for them. You can lose her forever if you don't give her ,her space, that's what happened to Ryan (skater) friend who lost his gf of a yr. He was too smothering;. No she won't forget you, if you know you made her really like you she definetly won't and you can tell when a girl is really into you. Though don't let this space thing be forever... cause that isn't healthy. Give her a few days then tell her whats up.<br>  <br>  I wish you 2 the best, and God bless you both :)

There is no real way to stop that except for notice it when you feel like you are doing it and then try to avoid getting in situations that would make it happen again. As for him commenting other Morroccan boys, there is nothing you can really do about that. They could be friends/family and no threat at all. Plus if he is a decent bloke, he wouldn't make anything come out of it.<br>  Hope that helps :)|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	Just be yourself. He will like you alot more that way, and i know this is hard to do, but you will love yourself for doing it.|`|SBXmPn9saa	you are losing yourself but you can try to believe it is not, just don't mind him or tell him what you hate about it.|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Pray about it.|`|umGi6gTcaa	so what he comments on Moroccan girls, there was something about you that he liked.

Monochronic people are those who prioritize getting the job done over social interactions. They see more value in money and in having a successful life and don't see the meaning of friendships as well as others. Polychronic people value social interactions along the journey rather than the end of the journey. They feel a higher need to be accepted by their peers. They simply enjoy and have a good time, but they may lose sight of the goal that needs to be done and the fact that there has to be food that needs to be put on the table as they get older.|`|Poru0GM7aa	friendship is the foundation of any relationship.thats because its built on trust.<br>  all friendship cant have same relationship but for a good relationship friendship is somewhere present.<br>  just giving a few words tough it could be explained in many ways
AA12190953	A general rule of thumb is that if a person (male or female) is blaming another for cheating or betraying the relationship it is because they are trying to get the attention off of themselves. Because they are the ones who are doing wrong. So the easiest way is to get the focus off of them self.<br>  <br>  But this isnt the case all the time ...<br>  <br>  This person could just have a very low self esteem. And feel unworthy of being loved enough to have someone be faithful. So if this is happening to you, just be very careful how you handle it. If the person has been cheated on before or had an abusive type of upbringing, if you really care about them you dont want to hurt them anymore than has already been done. Because if this is all true you could be the one to show them what true love really is. Try asking them if they have been cheated on and find out about how they were treated as a child. If they were told they were stupid, worthless or any other hurtful things these all cause a person to have self esteem problems not only as a child but as an adult to. Let this person know how you feel, and how it makes you feel when they say these things. And move on from there. You could also try counseling.<br>  Care and Bless

Ouagu7e0aa	You should sleep with him once you have a deep connection with him.  Don't waste sex on a guy who only wants sex.  <br>  Wait until you feel totally comfortable around him, until he feels like you're best friend.  <br>  When he's the one you come running too when you're excited about the new shoes you wore, or the first one to show you're new dress, or the first one you call when you get that 95 on the dreaded math test --- then it's time.  <br>  It's not something that should be rushed ---it should be treasured.<br>  <br>  :)|`|0cb8e28e25153f99663391d4bd8ec655aa	Listen young lady at your age you should not be having sex.

Try taking things slow and see how the relationship is going.

Just let him know you really like him a lot but want to make sure that he feels the same way.  Good luck.  If he is serious about you and the relationship, he should understand.|`|MOMb0Amoaa	i really dont know why kids these days start sleeping around at so very young ages.

I cant believe u would actually ask that on yahoo asks. to many peoples open opinions. ur a funny girl. ok. well, all i have to say is have a good life, who am i to judge, but yea ur funny.hahahahahah|`|T9JDbfLPaa	well i'm not going to tell you not to do it because you've already done it, but you should wait until it feels right! to some people that can be like a week, or months|`|rb8OGnmZaa	Don't even consider it unless you plan to have children at an early age.  And......don't do it unless you are planning on marriage.  Remember that he will not want to marry if he knows he can have sex with you anyway.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Well honey I am afraid you have already made your reputation as being slutty so the only way to change that is by not having sex anymore until you are mature enough to handle it.|`|bc27bca0091c66c66f4aa1e409b7ff4daa	im sorry but your really young to be having sex to begin with. make sure your safe or you will be sorry. if you were 18 I'd say wait at least a few months and get to throughly know him.|`|hmMb2oMOaa	for your age, at least 4 months. Harsh, isn't it?|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	Before getting married is TOO SOON.|`|YqkUDgL5aa	You're 14, you shouldn't be having sex.|`|C9z5g6pVaa	wow your young .<br>  maybe 4-5 months|`|AA10300538	u are 14....it will be too soon til u at least turn 16.
xrf7ScCTaa	I go for the cute ones! I've dated both, and the cute one was better. (I'm assuming that by 'hot' you mean the jock-type of guy that EVERYONE goes after, and by 'cute' you mean the slightly nerdish but sweet guy). Okay. The hot guy was kind of self-centred, he had hair gel on ALL the time (I have nothing against hair gel, but after a while, it looks really artificial) and everytime we passed a mirror, he'd look into it and sort of fix his hair. I got so fed up with him. The cute guy was nicer and shyer. My relationship with the hot guy only lasted a month; I've been with the cute one for the past year! =)|`|O2VfQyOdaa	the hot ones lol im 15 and most girls my age 15-17 go for hot guys =]
Cj52Qd7Qaa	if you do this you will have the biggest rush of adrenaline, its fun :), just walk up and ask him out who cares what happens,|`|jUKEqDmwaa	just ask him|`|1aVEuthXaa	have your freind hint to him but not tell him you like him.... but dont be the one to ask him out, sadly :( thats our job.|`|jjczoIhaaa	i like this boy and i have no clue if he  likes me i ask him if we r bff and he said yes and a card|`|gRgqGwVmaa	let ur friends ask him
zFx7NT2Baa	Go out to have sex in unusual places....free.  Do him in a theater, a park, alley way.....blah blah.  Help a little.|`|OiUiEMr0aa	well you should just stay with him and help him through his tough times =P and try and make peace with his parents and their wow adiction hahhaa it can really be adicting but once u dont play for at least 1 month you dont care anymore..as long as you dont go back|`|441002ba222c31246fd283fc8f2694bfaa	If he is so stressed out you need to try and do something to comfort him. Make sure he knows your there for him, and try giving him a message. And I can understand the problem of spending 1k a month. Try doing fun inexpensive things. It really is a problem if spending money isd the only way to have fun.<br>  <br>  You guys should able to have fun if you don't do anything more then cuddle in the dark...|`|SSb5Dr2Jaa	Sounds to me like he is being responsible.   If you are with him for fun and what he does for you then leave.  If you plan on a long term relationship then contribute ideas, activities and maybe some of your own money.  Personaly if I was him and I felt that the my girl was bored because we were not spending,  I would leave her:)|`|ICjBorriaa	Don't spend so much money, just spend money on things that you keep that are more intimate, buy more lingerie and just have heaps more sex and discover each other more. Or you could break up with him and find a guy with more money.|`|ztb7OCvyaa	Learn to have fun at home. Host parties like potlucks where you ask all of your guests to bring a part of the meal. Invite friends over for a night of board games. Find low budget or free things to do around town, like rollerblading, going to the park, going to cheap concerts, museums, or art galleries. Go out to a club that has a cheap cover charge and just party and dance without spending money on drinks. Go out for a day of window shopping and coffee. Have "dates" at home. One of the things that my ex and I did when we were both starving students was have a carpet picnic, where we'd spread out a blanket and have food and wine in front of a movie. You can have a lot of fun and not spend money.<br>  <br>  Edit: If he's stressed, just make sure to let him know that you're there for him and that you guys can still have fun. Let him know that you're his during good times and bad.|`|tVJP57fsaa	You don't need money to have fun lol...<br>  <br>  Go to the park when its empty and just go on the swings or something. <br>  <br>  Or go to the beach at sunrise or sunset and just talk.|`|AL2IqssLaa	maybe your relationship shouldnt be just based on material things.<br>  i understand where you are coming from but maybe if you are meant to be together you dont need the expensive dates to be happy
nZkZKNySaa	they have a baby now who was happily admitted:)<br>  that baby don't have any mistek,but that 13 and 15 yrs old must be punished to ruin the lief of a new born bcz they r unable to afford a child at this age|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	NO|`|onGWYMcjaa	Just don't have sex cuz he will be the next Alfie Patten if you do. <br>  Oh yeah btw read this crap I just found about that story. <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/13yearold-father-alfie-the-victim-of-cash-scam-girlfriends-family-friend-says-20090219-8bq0.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.smh.com.au/world/13yearold-fa...</a><br>  <br>  If they did it for the money then that's just fucl<ed up. Funny how everyone WANTS to be the father. If that was me I'd be like, oh hell no that's not my baby, give me a DNA test asap. But like all of those guys who are underage and had sex with that 15-year-old whore actually want to be the father. WTF. Thats pretty nasty too, I read somewhere that there were like 8 possible candidates to be the father, which is disgusting. That means that in a short period of time she had sex with 8 guys, imagine in the past 3 years, she probably had sex with like 200 guys. <br>  Also this 13-year-old kid is freaking retarded. He sounds just like a baby "I'll be a good father..." Freaking retarded little punk. <br>  I mean, I'm 15 and if I found out I got a girl pregnant I'd freak out even though I have the money to take care of the child.<br>  But seriously, that girl is disgusting.|`|PzkGIlPRaa	Go for it, its not the age but the maturity of the person!|`|1thElV58aa	Depending on the Maturity|`|OiUiEMr0aa	im 15 my girlfriend is 17 i love her =P do it|`|oUhcnED7aa	Personally, I don't. I don't think that a girl should be older than a guy when dating sense men act more immature than they really are.... <br>  <br>  I think the 15 year old should also wait one to two more years until dating seriously; but 15 may be acceptable pending on her maturity,|`|FkcJ9fzhaa	No i think it is really cute that you like someone so much , it shouldn't even matter what the age is . Although, sometimes age is not always just a number .|`|t3DfS5Vzaa	no|`|b82ba5aa852c579743186c47f88619caaa	Tough question. If they end up having sex together, even tougher question.|`|441002ba222c31246fd283fc8f2694bfaa	Love doesn't choose by age. Anyone can fall in love with anyone|`|BDaUBbLpaa	now that is weird!!! thx for the web dude... ok back to the question... no age doesnt matter... at all... if u like him,take him...|`|FI8tqUOAaa	Age doesn't matter. dont let anybody tell u that. Age is just a number. If u like him then date him
HKkbqlIuaa	I don't recommend marrying him. Firstly, IF it works out, the memory of your marriage won't be as special. Instead of a memory of him dropping to one knee and all that jazz, you'll just remember the thought of a green card. You guys should do it the right way and wait. Secondly, if you marry out of desperation, how do you know you're both ready? I say wait, he's definitely not ready by the sound of his responses to you. You don't want to rush something like this, especially if he's making it clear that he wants to wait. Well, good luck with everything. I hope it works out.
Ju57sA1iaa	That's sweet that you still love her after that, but don't enslave or hurt yourself. ok? (:(: um i guess at some point, there will be true love for the lucky few.. coz i agree, sometimes, you think you found the one then suddenly...BOOM... yeah.. so just be careful. choose wisely.haha and you take care.<br>  <br>  >>Frootloops...(:|`|2mHbi6Exaa	there is a thing as true love. jl is right, it's made, not found!|`|52ZYrhCjaa	There is nothing as True love and all. Its just the trust which we place upon someone which many people define as True love.|`|pFjgBBUZaa	yeh there is but it's hard to find :(|`|lb7exqUgaa	sometimes it just doesnt look like there is.<br>  <br>  why cant all the committed people be with committed people and the cheaters be with the cheaters?|`|so95ktlIaa	No and I am married|`|5VHWy0Ggaa	yes there is... you will find it one day!<br>  <br>  you seem young, don't worry you have the rest of your life to find the right one. you still love her, but you will see in time that she wasn't the one for you. i know it's hard when someone cheats on you, but things will get better. <br>  <br>  there's so many fish in the sea! keep your head up :)|`|eNfTWtDHaa	Been there and I have to say no.  Others are probably sayin yeah, but after my last 2 relationships (both crapolla-1 a cheater, the other usin me) I will have to say no.  Which is why I'm COMPLETELY DONE with them.  All you get from a relationship is burned.<br>  <br>  P.S.  Let the girl go.  If she luved you, she wouldn't have cheated so she ain't worth missing.|`|dSTQnHPraa	its out there waiting for you somewhere when your least expecting it, that statement above about it being "made" and not found is only half true. because all relationships are made, but there is only ONE true love out there|`|L8J5nNjDaa	yes.. and its made, not found
rqSVDNbbaa	just move you feet forward... it more than enough|`|cjevB9Mxaa	walk up to her and lift her shirt.<br>  <br>  no don't, im sure that's frowned upon.<br>  <br>  the best thing to do is just see who she hangs with, like if you have friends who are friends with her, hang out with them all and be nonchalant about it. be funny or be hot or be both, whatever your bit is.<br>  have a good time and you'll catch her attention.<br>  but don't try too hard because no one likes that.|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	Go up to her, with a smile and confidence and just say"hey wanna go out?"<br>  <br>  its what i would want my guy to do..|`|LxOKTU7raa	being friends is cool|`|w6dXWoPzaa	try to be best frds with her|`|SBXmPn9saa	try to look like a humble kid and be sad or happy at the same time and act like you want to talk to her, just do your best but don't get too nervy.

547d1311d2a04cb3ca3fabb2d74db832aa	the dazed look to your eyes... very interested in what you are saying... looking at your lips...<br>  you will most of the women do that... they will be very concious when you are aroung... and they will want to meet you more often... however they will try to deny it also in a very lazy way so that you do not take it seriously.......|`|QueLLNiraa	This is one I read about.<br>  <br>  Supposedly their legs are pointed towards you showing they have a interest towards you without them knowing they are giving it away!<br>  <br>  Have you noticed that if you want to exit the bus, you face your leg towards the exit.<br>  <br>  If you find someone interesting you face your legs towards that person.<br>  <br>  If your hungry your legs will point towards the food.<br>  <br>  ect. ect.|`|t8gYx9LIaa	Flicking their hair, playing with their hair.

Read Allan Pease Body Language, awesome book and tells you all!|`|qof2d5ujaa	swooning|`|c1d2c88ff0f3df80bdee984eca4b94fdaa	I would recommend just asking her out. At worst, she says no, and you are in the same place as before- but not wondering anymore. Eye contact is a good indicator of flirting. Also, an open or welcoming body language. Some women play w/their hair or try to bring attention to themselves when flirting.|`|oVw5BNaKaa	1. fake laughing at your jokes, while others look in disbelief<br>  2. they find an excuse to touch you<br>  3. they wait for you alot<br>  4. smile while looking away from you, not laugh, smile<br>  5. they lean in to talk to you|`|1psFgpmyaa	hold eye contact then break it and look back, play with their hair, push you or put their hand on your arm/leg, turn their body toward you, if they're crossing their legs they'll have the outside leg crossed over the inside leg so they're not shutting you out...|`|b7raN3sbaa	When they say, "No! No, please, don't touch me there!", it means that they are really enjoying what you are doing and you should continue, no matter how much they struggle. They're just playing hard-to-get.|`|K8j3ufTSaa	Women will often unconsciously play with their hair or neck. They will probably smile alot, make eye contact, and hopefully, give you their phone number! :)|`|4uLrv6Hjaa	show nervousness|`|Amf1wtJmaa	Eye contact|`|dLlI92OWaa	eye contact<br>  wink<br>  laugh at his jokes|`|eeaXYyCNaa	we laugh at all your jokes.  even if they are not that funny.|`|nLeJJ5nMaa	its either they show interest clearly, or play hard to get. so its almost impossible to tell. just ask her out. Those who say eye contact are dumb. my uncle makes eye contact with me, doesnt mean anything.
pQGUPITeaa	Yes I've often seen big heavy guys with tiny little petite women. I think the big "bear man" thing is a turn on for them.<br>  <br>  I've actually very rarely seen a slim man with an overweight woman - it's much more common the other way around.|`|1NCPPHR9aa	I agree with Daniel K|`|OtqB24NVaa	I dont like to call them fat BUT I like "big" men. Im thin, fit. Im not attracted to skinny, scrawny, boyish looking guys, or those big buff guys that look like they spend way to much time at the gym but I like a large, strong, manly man. Id say 6'1" or 6'2" and up and about 250 or so is perfect to me|`|bMLdEkncaa	me personally? no. fat men show unhealthiness, laziness, unwillingness to participate in (most) outside activities....but all in all it really depends on ur preference|`|PzkGIlPRaa	Yes if they have lots of money.|`|ba11546863a841cea0081f35f682a3ccaa	I dont mind fat man..its the heart that counts..|`|kbkbDhwLaa	Define "fat". Is Jack Black fat to most women? I personally find him very attractive. I prefer men that aren't thin. Of course, obese is a different story. But at the point of obesity, they should do something to help themselves. I don't judge someone based strictly on their appearance, or try not to. Judging is human nature, but it's another thing to be so shallow as to reject them outright because they don't fit your ideal.|`|GO46i2l9aa	Honestly, it might just be me, but I am all about personality! You could be the ugliest, fattest man in the world but if you can make me laugh I could totally dig you. So if you think you are overweight don't let it get to you. Be yourself and you will find the right person.|`|HWkWL90Faa	it shouldnt be like that. people should love someone for their personality not their looks. at least i look for personality. i think most women are very shallow.|`|AA10317249	I don't think women are shallower than men, I see a lot of women who look like they could get a much more attractive man, but it doesn't really matter as long as they treat each other right.|`|SCFD8AFJaa	I am not so sure but there are a lot of unique women out there|`|cIaqcI8Qaa	rofl|`|4bAZW3F6aa	yea they are called chubby chasers  lolz|`|B3qjtZuRaa	There are.  I've met them.  They're sometimes called "chubby chasers".<br>  <br>  You know...we all have our tastes!  Thank God we're not all alike -- that would make the world a very boring place.|`|CqXdx4Lqaa	love is blind and they dont see how the person looks in front and they just fall for love without caring about figure. i mean real love. yes there are thin womens who go for fat man as i am slim but my husband is fat......thats love.........true love i believe|`|TbtLSDPhaa	im sure there are millions why dont you google it ....:)
VZVGXRyraa	Dating isn't ever illegal. It's the sexual relations that are illegal (intercourse, oral, sexual touching).<br>  <br>  Date all you want, but keep it clean until after the youngest turns 18.|`|q7ZMQeCMaa	18 UNLESS YUR B-DAY COMES!:)|`|xtX7aaLqaa	it really all depends.<br>  I once dated an 18 yr old when I was 16 and that was ok but if you are 17 and date someone that is like 20 something....that would be a little weird and probably illegal. it would also look pretty perverted on the adults part. (typically the adult is a man)<br>  its pretty much the same thing as you dating someone around 13 lol|`|qIM2LtVzaa	There are two sayings, 15 will getcha 20 and jailbate. It really depends on the state. I live in Idaho where its up to the parents to push charges if they feel the need but the state can take control at a certain age. I would google your state laws.|`|UsJDUm1Haa	i dont think so. u have to be 18. but i heard that you can date someone but just not f*** them. idk|`|Kd3GRiLyaa	its never illegal to date an adult. just to have sex with one is illegal.|`|3YIiDiBvaa	depends on the state|`|AicQ9LdEaa	It's legal to DATE an adult at basically any age.  The problem comes when the sex starts.  Each state has it's own statutes that specify at what point does it become statutory rape.  Statutory rape means the you are too young to legally give the other person the right to have sex with you.  This applies to men as well as women.  You've probably heard in the news of female school teachers that got caught having sex with a male student.  You really need to familiarize yourself with your individual state laws.|`|6f6e7e5160e067ab66a1e886a3dd18bbaa	Yes. However it is illegal to have sex. That is considered statutory rape.|`|DAHBFQx6aa	It depends on what state you're in|`|Sb3Z19Myaa	define date.|`|2d754c286e742242bb30eff39d1d0325aa	only in some states...|`|UJkP79cIaa	no it isn't, ur just not allowed to hav sex wit dem|`|tkqkifq8aa	i don't think so !!!
0JiEQx4waa	It's probably Hemorrhoids... which is fairly common. You'll just need some Preparation H, and Tucks help too. If you can, you may want to go see a doctor if that doesn't work or it gets worse.|`|AA11625194	lord almighty see your doctor!
5VHWy0Ggaa	well you said he really likes you, but you should ask yourself if you really like him? i mean you said you wern't over your last relationship... i don't know you should probably break up with him, especially if you don't have any feelings for him. just explain what is going on, and tell him that even though this may be hard to do, you have to do the right thing... tell him that it's bad timing, and that you're not over you ex... don't keep leading him on, tell him now, because it will just hurt worse later on.|`|Jnv47zQgaa	get over it, its some one who loves u or someone who use to love u|`|SBXmPn9saa	well still try to get the new guy and when you find him you need him more get him and leave that ex,.even it will be tough.|`|xvxtQwV5aa	do you really like this guy as much as he likes you? If you don't, you need to be honest with him and break it off, it's just not fair to him. If you do, you still should break it off and tell him that you respect him and his feelings too much to continue the relationship until you can give 100% to him.  tell him the timing is wrong and maybe if the two of you cross paths again, when the time is right, you can give it another try. it's only fair to be honest with him, don't lead him on only to break his heart.|`|bMLdEkncaa	ummm, wait! really not rocket science ppl:. ;/|`|Oj0K08DWaa	i advise moving on very well may help you i suggest don't date some one if your not yet moved on..|`|iXns0i9Oaa	Think about who will provide you with more care and more support. If your last relationship was better then go with your old man. If the relationship with your current bf is better then you probably shouldn't make any wrong moves to screw that up.|`|2h4eetekaa	get over it
HnEcgVGiaa	Hi Meg,<br>  <br>  It's perfectly normal to be virgin at 19 years of age. I'm 23, and I'm still a virgin. And don't worry about not having been in a relationship just yet. You are still a teenager. I'm 4 years older than  you, and I haven't been in a relationship either. It's just that people find love at different points in their lives. Yours might come next week, next month, next year, or when you are 25 years old. We just don't know the future.<br>  <br>  However, what you must do is be patient. This is a test of your endurance and the ability to overcome this 'emptiness' that you feel in your life. Don't worry about because your life can change in a matter of days, hours, or even minutes at any given time in your life.<br>  <br>  6'1" is pretty tall, but there are lots of tall guys out there. Of course, I'm not one of them - I'm on the opposite side of the height spectrum, haha. But if the guy's height isn't something that you are strictly concerned about, then all you need to be concerned about is being more confident and respect for yourself and simply shining your positive character and smiles to others. That's pretty much all you need to do.<br>  <br>  Don't be concerned about your friends being paired off. There are plenty of singles in their 20's. As time passes, the person that you're destined to be with will come along. You just need to hang in there.<br>  <br>  Realize that you're a wonderful person. You can attract guys. Your height can indeed scare some guys away, but as long as you show that you're a sensitive, caring, and loving girl, you shouldn't have problems. <br>  <br>  We should definitely trade heights though! I'm 5'4" and would love it if I could be 6'+ tall!<br>  <br>  Anywho, you're not being left out. Bottom line, be positive and strong. Smile to others and present a welcoming attitude. Respect yourself and don't give up. You're life will be full of beauties, joyous moments, friendships, and love. They're right in front of you, full speed ahead!<br>  <br>  Best,<br>  <br>  Brian|`|72c068b751929002541e7f3bcccec4a0aa	It takes time to meet someone. Unfortunately, lots of ppl just "pair off" because they're bored, want to use someone, or just want sex. Good things come to those who wait. There will be someone for you, I promise. Just wait. And just b/c you have a bf doesn't mean you need to have sex.<br>  <br>  BTW I'm 18 almost 19. I'm a virgin too and plan to stay that way until marriage.  I met my bf in high school. He's my first boyfriend. We want our first time to be special so were waiting for our wedding night ;) <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5BIIG6Qwaa	It is normal if you are butt ugly but if not go get laid. Height is never a problem when it comes to sex.|`|gAhHCpRNaa	yes its normal i lost my virginity when i was 21.|`|FShuTadYaa	Uhhh yeah. It's normal to be a 19 year old virgin. My boyfriend was a 20 year old virgin. There's isn't a specific age where you have to lose your virginity. I think you're lucky to be that tall. I'm 4'11" and would loooove to be your height.|`|c636938d4d9996522ca0e857f01c5d17aa	I don`t know if it`s "normal" but whatever really is.<br>  <br>  I`m 17 No girlfriend or dates yet. And I scare everyone for a multitude of reasons.<br>  <br>  If it is any consolation I would take you out at 6-1 or 2 ;-).|`|ctSmc7UAaa	I don't see what's so abnormal about it,yes it's normal.It's fine.|`|AA10462002	Well it's not "normal" when you read the statistics of teenage pregnancy and whatnot.  Don't get me wrong, I'm 26 and I'm still a virgin myself.  Just I do feel we're in the minority sometimes.  However, I value myself and am waiting until I want to spend the rest of my life with someone.  Although part of me feels the same as you do, I look at some of my friends who are tied down with kids, and who aren't even with the fathers anymore, and i know I made the right decision.  <br>  <br>  Unlike you though I have dated and had bf's.  Just not any i really felt that connection with.  Maybe I never will, maybe unconsciously I'm afraid of the commitment (which I think is the case).  But I've had a few casual relationships.  Truthfully you're not missing out on much.  Always drama with the guys trust me.  When the right guy comes along, you'll know.  Let love come to you, don't rush it.  If a guy really loves you, or at least likes you enough to ask you on a date, he won't care about your height.  Eventually someone will come along that will cherish that quality, heck he won't have to bend down to kiss you.  There's someone out there for everyone, but like I said don't rush it.  It will happen in it's own time.  <br>  <br>  In the meantime, spend time with your single friends, and just enjoy life.  I know it seems everyone else is hooked up, but that's not true.  Relationships even at your age, are here today, gone tomorrow.  Trust me, your friend's relationships more than likely won't work out either.  Yes, there are people that marry their HS sweethearts, but statistically it usually doesn't happen.  Same with college sweethearts, lol...  And even if you're friends are dating, they should make time for you also, or their not real friends.  So just chill with them, and have fun.  Have at least 1-2 nights a week, where it's ladies night.  The guys HAVE to stay home, lol....<br>  <br>  Edit:  Can't believe how many guys even in their 20's are admitting to being virgins on here.  I think it's great that not only are they still virgins, but they admit to it.  Props to you guys :-)  It also gives me a little more hope for my future, lol....   My thing is I want it to be both our first ya know... More special that way... And I don't think there are many 26 y/o guy virgins out there, but maybe there's more than I realize....|`|zFx7NT2Baa	Lovely that you are a tall girl.  19....not a problem....not unusual.  Guys are often very shy.  Maybe you should take some initiatives.

pQGUPITeaa	Oh she's got IT!!!!<br>  <br>  She's got a hot body and lots of sex appeal, and she knows how to work men over and manipulate them (feminine wiles).<br>  <br>  You can't compete with that, so don't even try. It isn't because you're less attractive, it's because she just knows how to work it. <br>  <br>  Eventually someone will come along who just thinks you're beautiful and special and adorable, and he won't even look at your friend - he'll be so besotted with you. You'll say, "Isn't my friend gorgeous?" and he'll look past her and say, "Mm, I guess, not really my type".<br>  <br>  Girls like you get less guys, but they're more likely to get that one special guy.|`|FzFSzilmaa	are you wanting MORE attention??? then perhaps you need to accentuate your positives...<br>  <br>  is your body as good as hers??? do you dress "dowdy"??? do you not have confidence in yourself??? do you act shy or embarrassed???

Not the children.<br>  <br>  You are entitled to 50% of the assets. If you then choose to give some of that to your kids, that's your prerogative.<br>  <br>  You cant force your husband to agree on anything, that's why we have lawyers. If you cant agree you will have to go to court, and have the judge make a ruling.|`|BY2GA5pfaa	why dont you try asking him and telling him how much it means to you.
TxO3Wr3caa	Well, the real question is are you happy with him. Are you comfortable being around him? Maybe it's better to take it slow. If you fell confident enough, talk to him about it. If not, just brush your hand against his. Maybe he's feeling like it's too slow also! Sometimes the girl has to take the lead when the guys aren't ready.|`|AL2IqssLaa	just work up that courage to grab it haha<br>  or tell him your hands are cold so he will take the hint haha<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkvR4eWLtFg6KN74ujkJBhjty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222230428AA29vMH">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|rs7BYB1maa	youre taking it slow, but if you want things like this to happen, make the first move. hes probably thinking about it too|`|ai76o21qaa	it means he either wants to have sex with you or just maybe he likes you|`|eu3Gi5BNaa	it means take it slow|`|5agXk9ldaa	well do it your self , hold his hand and see his reaction, maybe he is just waiting for you to do the move
4e8znjSuaa	First of all, the guy doesnt really need to ask the girl out. You can take control of the situation. Second, he might have just come out of a bad relationship and isnt sure about getting into a new one, so dont pressure him and just be yourself and if you are a good girl he will know.|`|7QGfUICsaa	just ask him out to a date . During the date show him that ur not like his ex|`|ZRbTdQ6iaa	Ask him out!|`|M4GYj9UIaa	Take him out on a date see a movie then grab a coffee afterward and have a chat see if it can work its way out
BMt8jcTwaa	ummm i wood say wen ever u see her tell her whats on ur mind like omg i cant take my eyes off u! or wow ur so pretty do u wanna have lunch are something like that i dunno tell her u like her Straight out i like u and see what happens! good luck|`|1jIzBUkhaa	well i would say , want to get something to eat after class. then slowly ask her what she likes to do. and her favorite song, favorite colors, and then say you know i have know you for a long time . and i really like you . do you like me the same way. want to go out on a date some nite.|`|HFemIoh6aa	well ask her "hey i heard u like classical music, well i do too". u can problaby buy concert tickets and ask her out or something. that's the best i got srry.|`|7ko9czaaaa	write her a note and say i would like to know you better and give her your email.|`|IH7KP137aa	Obviously by your question where it says "she's super hot!!!" you really don't like her most likely because that wouldn't be one of the first things you say.|`|1VBmkBz7aa	hey!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thats my girlfriend!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BACK OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|SL1bsp4zaa	Don't tell her you like her.. that would probably be awkward. See if you can find a way to ask her out on a date... something simple at first.. like ask her if she'd want to go out for hot cocoa or coffee after a tutoring session sometime.. if she agrees, that is probably a good sign. Continue this and just try to get to know her.. pay for the coffee so she gets the hint that its kind of a date. Continue this until you get a feel whether she likes you or not ... then if you think she does like you.. you can then tell her that you like her. If you need advice on what to say once you get to that point-- I would just say something like... Hey (insert name here)... I think I'm starting to like you :) -- but make sure its a good moment... like if you kiss or if you hug or something come out of the hug or kiss and say that :) that would be a good plan !|`|AA11441704	Ask her how is class etc..........ask about piano|`|WQ1sjTPDaa	jusy say first. and get answer, yes or no.<br>  <br>  keep cool your mind
BGOPARrTaa	my girl of my dreams!!!! hot and so sexy, average, nice woman, big ****, and *** and beautiful face!! and easy to read, easy to get! i wont take someone that is like really hot but not true person and dont do any s h i t! i want a girl that tells the trued and just a really nice woman!! start of kinda shy and get to kno her and she is letting out her heart! and just a carrying person and yea! dats the type of girl i like!! really nice girls!|`|XYOYml59aa	Not the so much average but has to be nice. The real girl of my dreams is not really too serious usually but knows when she has to be. She is just herself and not afraid of that, even if she does get some complaints about it. But yea, kind of like that|`|ykyMSEKGaa	One that can adapt to any social situation, but doesn't need to be the center of attention in groups.  I like a little mystery to my girl but not one that isn't willing to talk about or confront her baggage (we all have baggage).  Mixed clues are such a turn off yet so many women can't be open as to what they want.  If I have to be a mind reader on a regular basis then I give up. If you mean easy to get by easy to get in bed, then that is cool if I am looking for a short time thing.  However, when it comes to a girl that I am going to get serious about, I want to have to wait for a while and I hope that is how she has been in most of her relationships, otherwise I question her morals, confidence and her fidelity.  The most important things would have to be that she is willing to compromise and be realistic on some issues and lastly.....passion.  I want a girl that can get excited about many facets in life and doesn't accept the boredom of the rat race that consumes so many of us.|`|bMLdEkncaa	well im a girl but what i think men like in a dream girl is:<br>  <br>  1. someone that they can talk to about anything<br>  2. speaks her mind but not in a bitchy way<br>  3. is beautiful in her own way<br>  4. not like everyone else.<br>  5. nice body<br>  6. great personality<br>  7. not bitchy<br>  8. treats them out too/offers to pay sometimes <br>  9. loves to do the same things they do but gives them space when they need it<br>  10. isn't needy but is caring<br>  11. athletic<br>  12. sensual<br>  13. only has eyes for her guy<br>  14. listens to you<br>  15. most like long hair and well kept hair<br>  16. make-up but not so much that when she takes it off she doesn't look dead or someone who needs to put it back on'<br>  17. nice *** (firm and just enough for his hand to cup the cheek)<br>  18. i think men like the dipple in the lower portion of the back right above the ***<br>  19. confident but not pushy<br>  20. same beliefs<br>  21. someone u can wake up by the next morning and wanna just stare at while they sleep<br>  22. breast that he can cup and obviosuly likes to fondle and say theyre his<br>  23. nice well moistened lips (always wear the chapstick!)<br>  24. someone u want to share ur thoughts with and wants to listen to them and shows interest <br>  25. manicured feet/hands<br>  26. ones that smell good (settle perfume and not overpowering)<br>  27. nice eyes<br>  28. ....the list continues....|`|v0PYtEt7aa	I like a girl who is intelligent and beautiful. I don't like girl who are attention seekers. I like the girl-next-door type. Maybe a mix between Angelina Jolie and Kate Hudson :) That my dream girl.  BUT.. thats not saying if I had the chance with both I wouldn't take it lol|`|MDTj4U75aa	Someone who will always keep me confused (in a good way).|`|AA11120493	My dream girl is starts out shy. As we get to know each other she opens her heart to me. When I do something silly she laughs and doesn't ruin a moment by getting too upset. Her sense of humor has to match her laugh. A laugh were everyone doesn't cringe when she lets loose after a good joke.

Or say something like, I think I'm going to need earplugs because the walls here are really thin that I can actually hear you breathing heavily  when you sleep!|`|umGi6gTcaa	LOL<br>  Tell him,<br>  "Could you please jerk off in the show like a normal guy, your creaky bed wakes me every time."<br>  <br>  "Damn man, are you okay?

n7uzcdRbaa	It sounds like a particularly troublesome thought, it disables you. I agree with the Anxiety suggestion and wonder is this intrusive thought is the tip of a even more troublesome OCD/anxiety/depression disorder that is tripping you up.  If you have other ritualistic behaviour or thoughts that seem to get in the way of your thinking, you may benefit from seeing a psychologist or even medication.  It would begin by having a good chat with you local doctor about the things you experience.  good wishes x|`|nMcjBv4saa	i went through that too eventually i stopped thinking about it ,u might suffer from anxiety tho|`|Ic2RXP1Haa	No, I don't think it's normal. It seems to me you might be suffering from an anxiety disorder. You should slowly stop yourself from thinking that way. Try engaging in some activities that would take those nasty thoughts off your mind.|`|RiHiOCANaa	I've heard of people having an ocd problem scared to lose their family members or hurt them you should do research on it
TAT0bkXyaa	Just walk. I thought you didn't have a job, how are you putting gas in the car? as for washing it, that's free just do it yourself. You could drop her off?|`|3sKU83sPaa	Ultimately, it's her car. And going to school doesn't prevent you from getting a job - there's always part time. You gotta remember, she has every right to tell you no, it's cool that she's even let you in the past. It sucks, yeah, but you have to respect her. It's part of growing up :)|`|9nOQlbwEaa	Make your mom happy with you, by telling her that since you and her are in one family, and it is your duty to help her in the house work and washing car, so in the same way, she also must share her car with you, but do not insist, only when she is not using it.
JOxl0gzaaa	Probably not unless someone actually finds the strength to leave. Shes probably just emotionally attached so its hard for her to leave.  Either he's going to have to say no to her coming back or giving into her needs.|`|QFpXZJhPaa	don't ask me. tell me when you find out because i'm in that situation now.|`|2vgbJhlRaa	nope move on with your life, stay positive and find someone else that will like you for who you are.|`|l5MCXmTaaa	No ....

Just so know he will NEVER marry you. And trust me honey he is lying to you when he tells you his unhappy. He just wants the best of both world. I suggest you move on. By the way how would you feel if you were in his wife's shoes? Having your husband sleep around like that.|`|CHlxBbkHaa	You should back the F off.  Married men are off limits.  If he gets a divorce and it is finalized then you can tell him your feelings.  Till then you'll just be the woman who helped destroy his marriage.|`|Xi2lGjKyaa	yes u can tell what u feel<br>  but just be nice to him and find whether he love his family need a advice from u to solve his problem|`|xYgFcEfwaa	you have to be more specific!<br>  unhappy from who?<br>  what feelings you have against him or someone else>|`|5Svun5rVaa	yes it is...like the saying says" the truth will set you free" sometimes we failed to say our feelings to our crush,our love..it's because we think that they'll say negative things that will upset us. we should think widely that they'll not say bad comments as long as you are true to them. firstly, ask him why is he unhappy to his married life? when he share the reason why, then that's the right time you'll tell the truth to him that your in love and you can't help it but to tell the truth. it's ok....i know,ifeel and i cansense it that he'll understand.

If it doesn't both of you should make sure you are not emotionally attached or someone is in for some big heartbreak.<br>  <br>  Yes you can move out of the bedroom, start by transferring the bedroom activities to other room, eg living room, garden. Then start doing other activities in those rooms.<br>  <br>  All the best, always give love a chance.|`|kFkxby1Jaa	if it hasn't moved beyond the bedroom in 8 years its not going to move now.....or ever...just enjoy what you have|`|msoDXmvuaa	omg you have such a strong bond with this person...i ususly get sick of the same vagina in like a week.... god bless you
I24FeiQvaa	Congratulations!<br>  I hope I get to join the ranks of grandmothers some day.<br>  What feels right to you? <br>  Something short and easy to say? Or something more formal?<br>  Nana? I like either Gran or Nan.<br>  When I had my first child, my own mother and grandmother were *very* concerned about what they should be called. My mother-in-law (we're American) just wanted to be called Grandma, and that's what I would be called.|`|0lumxiJMaa	in my opinion, i like the name nanna, or nan because it is easyer for them to say when they are little and the name Grandma makes you sound really old,where nan could just be passed of as a normal name.|`|ymWkGqm7aa	I prefer Nan. Don't know why!|`|qsqmykzsaa	when my first grandchild was born, my daughter asked me the same.<br>  <br>  Her mother in law wanted Granny, and I didn't.<br>  we decided Nan would be good. now, 15 years later, some call me nanny and some nan.

dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	?? good for you.  give her some tasks to do then if she's so bored.  put the woman to work on some project for you.  get her more involved in your endeavors.  maybe she's feeling left out of your successes or perhaps it's time that you put some effort into helping her to achieve some of her goals/dreams.  good luck and keep up the good work!|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	Some girls will always like the "bad boy" image. If seems to me that this is what your girlfriend wants. Well done on turning your life around, if shes not proud of you for changing, and instead complains that shes "getting bored", then shes not worthy of being called a "girlfriend".|`|XsgP1O7gaa	Perhaps she is feeling a little left out. Or, it could be because the person and your attitude before was the person she fell in love with, and that you may have changed with personality ways. However, talk to her about it. Tell her you know that she may be annoyed/ feeling left out, but you also want your life to improve and thats why your changing your ways.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|K4NuO8bnaa	talk with her, sort things out. maybe she was into the bad boy type better... who knows id let her go n get sumone who appreciates.|`|msoDXmvuaa	well my good friend.. its time you got ur game on... their is soo much vag out their ..more now then ever

(too?) they say i make em feel like an animal. soooo i guess thats a good thing. so yea i guess both of us are masochists.|`|dnwJmNkdaa	Well, you're not weird... The problem is that people who really enjoy this may not do it out of fear.  That is usually not sexual in nature,, so ppl may seem back offish.  So, be very gradual in introducing what you want into the bedroom...  start with the hair pulling put their hand on the back of your head clench their fist and sexy it up tell them "pull my hair and take me" or "pull me down"<br>  There are S&M groups in aboiut every state and major city go online and look em up.... maybe you meet someone maybe not but if your with someone new already just take it slow and eventually they will get it... the point of sex is pleasing your partner so....|`|e7302da69a66d35643b221f8f86ec06daa	Something like that.

What if the situation was reversed?|`|ib10oHUZaa	i think u need 2 realise everyones different.<br>  we all react different n think about things differently.<br>  shes clearly a confident person who trusts u.<br>  most ppl wish 4 that...as oppose as 2 having someone on their back 24-7. <br>  <br>  it isnt a trick..she jsut trusts u n herself.|`|f46369427ac23f51a8717fcf25bfb72aaa	she either trusts you, or isn't into this relationship. I don't question my guy about all that....I do love him, and he asked me the same thing when I never questioned him, so I understand what you're talking about. It's just that I want to give him the trust, he breaks it, that's on him, and he knows it. we are still together and it's been 9 years...and we joke around when someone messages him or me that it's my other boyfriend or girlfriend. why don't you just ask her?|`|Bj64sValaa	Every girl gets jealous once in a while. It's either she's hiding her true feelings - jealousy, or because she doesn't want you to think that she doesn't trust you. It could also be because she has a lot of guy friends, and she doesn't want you to have a problem with them talking to her either. (:|`|udQ2D5v9aa	Well, maybe she is just not that into you....
dDSuBQURaa	If you don't confront him with this, you will always be shaking and wondering who else he has been chatting with and getting dirty pics.|`|Yu7vBUkOaa	You could start by explaining that you are a suspicious, untrustworthy criminal who illegally broke into his email.<br>  <br>  ... or you could just stop seeing him and move on with your life.|`|X6aYVpU3aa	it would be just email, boys usually plays like this, mostly all of them specially at this times of internet, what do you expect? there are lots of temptations.  it is hard for you to accept and surely hurts you, if you cannot take it, you can move on, you don't have to confront him about this as this is just all wifi.|`|rqSVDNbbaa	he is already hurt just because he MISunderstood you on GOOD..<br>  <br>  If  you think he played you just move on.. you already la bled him as a player......... ITS Really not  good to spend your life with a player....<br>  <br>   yeah girls were semding him nude pictures....YOU know why because he knows for sure THEY dont deserve his Password.......<br>  Dear I Know people who are in relationship as husband & wife would never share their password. I THINK he is very happy on oppting his .....<br>   you have every right to enter his mail...but its a sad end still ...<br>   ........................... my wishes for you guys|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	You obviously have no trust in him otherwise you wouldn't have been snooping into his "private" emails (and they are private...they are HIS emails...not yours).  So, what's left now??.. nothing.  You're relationships is over..........|`|Bip9F2Wraa	What are you doing checking his email?  Gurrl - GET A LIFE.  Move on.|`|tBaCFTtBaa	ignore these dumbasses.. my boyfriend and i have passwords to each others email and i snoop once in a while.  in fact, i have actually found things myself, but he has had reasonable explanations for them.. or im Really stupid lol.  no really, if you have 100% hardcore evidence.. the first thing you want to do it copy and paste those conversations onto word or notepad before he deletes them!  even save the pics he has in your photoshop.  that way, you can address him in person and show him what you found.  screw the law!  it should be against the law to cheat on others and it sucks that sometimes we have to dig to find out, but its better you found out now.  now, either you can be nice about it, or you can totally screw him over (since you have his password and all).  thats up to you.  either way, get rid of him!  good luck!|`|ulW7G8nPaa	Nevermind that you snooped, men do it too, but that's not the issue.  His cheating is the issue.  Leave.   Just leave the password by his computer or send him some of the stuff in an email and tell him it's over.  You don't owe him anything, no explanation, nothing...something he did or didn't do made you feel this way and you were right to obviously.  Word of advice 9 times out of 10 they will do it again....trust me I know.  Sorry that this happened to you.|`|a0024a8805bd3c2a385199e722566faeaa	Your relationship is over.  He'll never trust you and you don't trust him.  <br>  <br>  The relationship isn't over because he cheated...it's over because you have both violated each other's trust.  <br>  <br>  It's childish to go through his email.  I'm not saying it's worse than cheating.  I'm saying that you both aren't mature enough to be with one another.  One person has to be secure...and neither one of you are.|`|AA11452969	Boys will be boys.. First. enhale and exhale. I know how it feels when you are so mad and shaking!!! calm down a bit. Listen. Confront him in a good manner always keep in mind that u also broke some rules by Looking at his email. Tell him that u guessed his password right and found email from girls and him that you think is offensive. Let him explain first, if he cannot explain well stay calm and just say, sorry for breaking in ur email and for not trusting u, i guess my instinct are just way too good that it pushed me to do this things find out what uve been doing wrong to me. Then stop from there and leave. Dont talk to him anymore and let him apologized until u are ready to face him wit answer. If u want to forgive and continue with him or forgive him but move on without him.|`|vm3hfmqGaa	contact all his contacts with a mass e-mail "hi, i am and have been with this man for x months/years and i just want to tell you all that this man is a pig.<br>  <br>  THEN move on|`|hvZSKn6Eaa	You wanted to know and now you've found out...<br>  <br>  Get drunk, cry, shout a bit, move on....Tis dead...|`|FzFSzilmaa	so you snooped... that isn't very nice... <br>  <br>  maybe you should just dump him and move on...|`|yY4kRNEQaa	The best thing to do is stay calm.  Calmly let him know that you know and that it is over.  And leave it at that.  As much as you want to scream, fight, make him feel stupid.  It will really get under his skin that your not hurt, and he will feel really stupid, he wont show it at first but eventually, it will drive him insane, just have patience, he will regret his actions. Trust me I speak from experience.  And I'm not gonna lie I'm back with him and now we live together and everything, but me being calm and leaving him for a long while really showed him the error of his ways.  And trust me I'm crazy, I wanted to just beat the s*** out of him, but I learned from past relationships that that pain on them only lasts a day, and showing that you don't care is something they will never forget because they thought you loved them and they made such an effort and now that he's cheating you dont acknowledge it, it will really irritate him.  Good Luck!!!!|`|23c0a317741b64dac19db750b9214973aa	What you did, isn't very nice. Quite tricky, isn't it? If you hadn't snooped, you may never know that he is capable of such things. And yet, if you hadn't, you would just remain blissfully in love.<br>  At the same time, he doesn't seem honorable if he did such stuffs anyway. You are hurt, and it does look like you need a confrontation. Maybe you could ask him nicely. Of course, if he is a nice guy, he would be guilty of it. Otherwise, he would use the "you snooped!" stance to turn the tables onto you.|`|4DHIrlJ9aa	Tell him you were being a psycho whore and you never trusted him or believed anything he said so you want out of the relationship. If he's a dog, you're an african swamp donkey.|`|HcXtS3pxaa	Who cares if you snooped! That doesn't mean he isn't in the wrong. Don't let him turn it on you and blame you for reading his email. Confront him and decide whether you can forgive or if it's over! Good luck|`|I2ZhcLVKaa	Kill him.

We have fun together.<br>  <br>  If you're sparking, don't let it go. Pursue it avidly. It'll pay off.

zFx7NT2Baa	As a guy, I would expect the attachment after the first time to be less than for a woman, partly because it appears that most men/boys give it to an older woman.  Now the older woman has had her pleasures and will not encourage you to hang around.|`|I2YUzjQ8aa	Im a guy and im a virgin. I cant really say yes or no because no woman on earth can take my virginity from me until im married. If the guy is idiotic enough to lose his virginity before marriage then he probably would be stupid enough to get attached to the short-term relationship ,depthless woman that took it away from him|`|ff545BLyaa	I cant say, the person who took my virginity was my best girl friend ever (not girlfriend but like bff).  So we were already attached emotionally before...  I am no more attached to her today then I was before she is still my best friend.  That was 3 years ago, we are both 19 now.|`|8JU1hxZ1aa	Umm as a girl that has taken waaaaaaaaaaay to many (and thus had some god awful sexual experiences) no it doesn't or if it does they do that thing guys do where they completey bottle everything up.<br>  <br>  Also for a girl i didn't get attached emotionally over the sex but over other things that happened in that relationship.|`|uvcqPfuNaa	Even though there isn't anything physically in man to show whether or not he is a virgin, men still feel that attachment. It is a major step in life so a man is going to have some sort of life long connection to that girl. He won't forget her.|`|LHhds2tQaa	me and my girlfriend both switched our v cards. I am thinking about ditching my plan of 4 years to move out with my dad to go to college. I am thinking about staying where I am at to be with her.

No simple answers.  People are as they are and very very difficult to change, so he is likely to be the same years from now. With the lovely daughter and some good in the past you can move forward with a little confidence, slowly, by being affectionate yourself and seeking (as my wife and I do) to say once every day, "I love you."  In your case, after saying that, show some genuine affection.  Maybe he will respond the same way with what he says and imitate the affection you have shown.  So -- sigh -- maybe you can only get what you want emotionally by offering your own emotion and love.  I hope you well.|`|4bAZW3F6aa	your husband sounds like the materialistic type, and what you should do is put a booty embargo till he accepts your demands|`|2R897ziraa	you cant make anyone appreciatee you it just has to happen and from the way it sounds he is a really lucky guy that doesn't know what he has or maybe is using what he has to get what he wants but if i were you i would talk to him about it and tell him you need more from him them give him some time and if he doesn't deliver then there is only one thing you can do and that is make yourself happy and sometimes even if that isn't what you really want to happen it may be needed and you might have to think about a divorcee|`|wdLqioPiaa	Do you really think guys are going to respond to this boring crap??<br>   No seriously?<br>  <br>  <br>  HAhahahahahahha!!!!I'm disgusting?!!I know I look better than you! Your the one that's being used by your own husband! at least I'm not bitching and whining in my question. look at my answers and then look at yours. Also, my husband tells me what he's feeling and what's up. It's sad to think that a sorry exuse for a mother like you has a child. and If I was your husband, I would use and take you for granted to.
6Nj5VZQ8aa	NEVER~!!! SOMEONE had to put the ad there, real person. No fake person.|`|rMq9D06Faa	If you got an email out of nowhere from an attractive woman and it sounds too good to be true, it might be.  (Especially if it is from a foreign woman.)  Many men/women post pictures of beautiful women to try and get you to send them money.  Be careful!<br>  <br>  Then again, she could be real and maybe she sees something in you!|`|pFjgBBUZaa	yeh alot of people do!!...she could be a he so watch out, they are called pervs/weirdos :)|`|teoBeZ6zaa	She is probz rllly ugglly! dont reply!|`|IdERL5d4aa	Lots of people put up fake ads. Don't let your low self esteem harm your opinion, though- your "league" is wherever you want it to be. Beware of anything, ANYTHING involving a financial deal. You should also ask to meet in a public place, as unlikely as it is that they're setting you up to mug you.|`|m2XgbsY2aa	she could be pretty, ugly, or average.  this is not real what matters though.  if you are only exchanging emails, then don't worry about it and have fun.  but, if you think you might let some private info slip like... your number, address, home town, school, etc... then stay away from her and all personals period!  <br>  <br>  sexual predators like child molesters and rapists use personals to find victims all the time.  be careful.|`|CcffGmqTaa	ppl do sh-it like that all the time, look if you want a girl get one in the real world not on the internet. <br>  <br>  ppl like to mess with others because they get a kick out of it. they have no lives. you can im "her" but i wouldn't give "her" any personal information.|`|1aVEuthXaa	its fake, they gain revenue for everyone who clicks on the ad. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://wegotthelinkz.com/" rel="nofollow">http://wegotthelinkz.com/</a>|`|QM1zBFj6aa	in my opinion, never trust the internet. someone could easily post a hot random person's picture, but  be fugly in real life|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Have you posted a personal on Yahoo? If not, the email is a fake. Is the source of the email even from your country? If not, it is a fake. Does the email refer to you by name or any of your personal details? If not, it is a fake.<br>  <br>  And even if you did use a personals site, fakes will respond in there just to try to scam your money.<br>  <br>  Presumably if you click some link in the email, something will eventually prompt you to part with money.|`|2mlHf7Opaa	It's definitely fake.
M2YXvH5waa	There is no such thing as a perfect boyfriend.<br>  Sorry.|`|c55O7jqXaa	I can guarantee you will not a "perfect" out there, but you can have some good relationships and especially when you get to be older and get to where you both are interested in a long term marriage.<br>  <br>  It is actually a good thing that we have to go thru some of these crappy relationships so we can learn from them and be stronger because of them. You won't realize that in the moment, but you will look back someday and see it and be thankful.<br>  <br>  Just try to see the jerks and not give them too much of your time.|`|jFi4ARUEaa	that doesnt exist|`|AA10010935	You take time your time and really get to know people, before it develops into anything.   It's important to be friends with them and know who they are.  You have to stop allowing yourself to be hurt all of the time.  One of the ways to know who is worth your time is to know yourself really well.   What is important to you, do you respect yourself?    Get into volunteer work, or go to places that you enjoy and you'll probably meet some good people that way.      But don't be in a rush for a relationship to happen right away.   Know exactly what you want in a  person, and go with that.|`|ey8aWCPUaa	Have respect for yourself, try to recognize things that have hurt you in the past, and don't date anyone you don't want to.<br>  <br>  There's no such thing as a perfect boyfriend though, so watch what flaws you weed out, and which ones you accept.|`|oPemNbMgaa	Sounds like..what i am looking for. I want to find a attractive looking girl, that would like me a lot && wants for the relationship to work out. I'm a good looking 18 year old guy, but its just hard to find a nice girl these days :/|`|N5q1osbCaa	There is no perfect man out there in this world. I'm sorry to tell you this but, you can't be in a relationship without getting hurt at least once. What you could do though is just date. But be sure to tell the men you date that you are just dating so you're seeing other men, well **** I don't even know how old you are so that may be the wrong advice to give. I guess to know if he's the "right one" as they say, he won't dare of hurting you. Just know if you go through getting hurt again, it's not gonna kill you and you'll find someone better.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|vsDbgfp1aa	YOU are cute! and naive-No one is perfect my dear- Just keep a certain reserve when you meet someone-Don't go all out and trust them and let them be in  control-Say NO when  you should Keep your dignity and be a little mysterious by not letting them know al about you and your life, take things slowly and  have your own space and given them theirs-Dont be clingy, dont think that tears will win him, they hate that!!<br>  If you feel in your gut that this guy is just a taker MOVE away for good<br>  Have  pride in your own self-confidence- If you dont feel respected Move away as well-<br>  See how he behaves with waiters, others, Is he rude, condescending? does he respect others? Does he respect his mom , other  women? If YEs He is a decent bloke, if not he is a CAD<br>  You will learn as you mature!|`|jOtiUBoHaa	There is no perfect guy and everyone will hurt you but you have to find a guy that is worth it. I suggest getting to be friends with a guy you are atracted to first then you already know their flaws and exactly why you are attracted to them. Plus if you are friends first the guy will usually let you off softer because he probably cares about u atleast as a friend and dosent want you hurt.|`|cllt4Alraa	To find your perfect match, keep your options open and hope for the best. dont just get stuck to one person or thats wasted time until you know you love them and they are perfect|`|4bAZW3F6aa	its hard to say with the limited info you provided, email me so i can better help you|`|OUefe0pAaa	Simple.... this site...<br>  <br>  www.ebay.com.au

441002ba222c31246fd283fc8f2694bfaa	First off, never take a girl to a bar, never date a girl at a bar<br>  <br>  Bar + Girl = Complete and utter failure in any way.<br>  <br>  Second, yes your jacket is a sign. A girl usually will not take your jacket if she doesn't like you. If she took it, then at least she is comfortable with you.<br>  <br>  Just bring it up casually. Go somehwere and hang out with her. make it a point to tell her that you always have fun when you hang out wiht her. Tell her that she is the best to spend time with. Do the same thing she does and start out by sending subtle hints through things you say. "you know, every time i am with you, I'm having fun."<br>  <br>  The signature move I used occured one cold night at the park. It was cold, we were all sitting around the slide and we started joking around. I slid to the bottom and was laying down, she was at the top. I said "Bet there is room for two down here." she bet against me. I pulled her down and we lay there fr a few minutes, cuddling in the cold squeezed together on the slide. I slowly moved closer, and she shifted a little, but didn't pull away. That is the sign that she wants you to do it. If she lets you get that close and doesn't pull back she wants it.<br>  <br>  Remember, rejection sucks, but the risk is well worth the payoff. Love rocks.|`|IbWBAwVPaa	That definitely sounds like a sign to me! Why not ask her to a movie or lunch? Best of luck!|`|PbPiF2p3aa	Girls at this age are difficult because they are scared of dating. Give her a hint that you might ask her out like tell a friend of hers. This way it will get back to her and she can think about it. Then in the next day or two ask her out. Just remember even if she says no you will make her day just by asking. From a girls perspective it always did for me no matter how ugly or weird they were it always made me feel "pretty". Good luck.|`|1UtO329daa	girls dnt like to be messed around so just come out and say it maby go for some ice cream or sumin everyone loves ice cream|`|KVVOMD2Uaa	well i think yes

If u guys are good friends it could be awkward if you went out but then broke up because it would ruin your friendship...so maybe she just doesn't want to hurt your friendship.(my friend liked her good guy but didn't ask him out for that reason)<br>  Ps I'm 13 too|`|BgeeUj9Oaa	Yes she does thats all ive got to say just give a go if you like her to|`|VRipScGTaa	maybe|`|R16xL5zpaa	it sounds to me like she likes you:) she is doing pretty much everything a girl does to flirt with a boy she likes. <br>  she may just be feeling weird about this, especially since you two are such good friends. maybe you should tell her that you like her? hope i could help.|`|tnRgL219aa	sure why not?<br>  Just ask!!!

Why not have the pleasure of you coming as he comes along -- so to speak.  Maybe, if you like, you might do what one of my long-time gals liked to do.  When morning came she woke me and spread my legs.  Guys are stiffist in the morning, so morning is good.  She then controlled her coming and mine via lip and tongue.

pQGUPITeaa	You should listen to your friend.|`|Kd3GRiLyaa	first off you dont already love him. you dont just love some one right after one night and who knows you could be the one girl to make the player quit the game.|`|ESY3gn7caa	That's really tough to answer.  When you really like a guy your perception becomes distorted and sometimes you're not a very good judge of character, but at the same time your friend could also be jealous or biased.  I'd say ask around--see if he really is a player and if hes worth it.  Then think about why you like him.  If you cant think of real reasons or if you get a weird feeling in your gut (a bad-weird) then maybe you should just leave him.  Your friend is, after all, your friend and wants to make sure you don't get hurt.  Maybe he's picking up vibes from you or this guy and knows its not going to work out.  Oh, and if you have to choose between your friend and your guy--pick your friend.   Its not worth loosing him for someone who may, or may not, turn out to be worthy of your attention.|`|aAUeWJ5laa	You need to listen to yourself but you also need to be aware that a best friend always knows. I say give this guy a chance but make sure you have someone to pick you up if you fall.
d9tCS7BPaa	I would question that too. Honestly if someone I was dating that tattooed someone else's name then that would make me think she is playing me. I would find someone else, honestly. She sounds shady. Don't you want someone who only wants you and only YOUR name tattooed on her? Thats major major disrespect.|`|eeaXYyCNaa	sounds like she still loves him.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Yeah, that is not normal and is very strange. I can understand her wanting her child's name. And it would have been normal to get his name if she was still with him, but she is not anymore. Sure they share a child, and in that sense they will always have a connection, but that doesn't make it appropriate for her to get his name tattooed.|`|zc82Q0KRaa	Considering your name is Vato that is probably normal that your people are tatooing names all over themselves at the drop of a hat. Dont sweat it, tell her to put your name on her navel or above her butt, opposite of his.|`|vj2pWs9Maa	That's really strange....I would think she still loves him.  I mean, I know he's the baby's father but I still think it's really odd.  I would be thinking she has some unfinished business with him or something?|`|i3pn4jNcaa	shes just useing you ntil things with him and her can be settled down leave her.|`|9QF6GGyiaa	Wow, when I read the title of your question I thought no biggie but she's with you and still got his name?? Thats ridiculous. Not saying that you will have to compete with him but honestly why would you want to stay with her if you know she already has her own family as she puts it. Don;t you want to have YOUR OWN family. Its obvious she still cares about him much more then the fact that he's her sons father. I'm not sure how serious you two are but he will always be there in the future. I feel bad because I don't know her but I would break it off before things got crazier. Since he'll always there they may get back together. Its a big possibility. Sorry about that, that sucks.|`|W0ZsuxRTaa	i don't think she meant to do it to offend you, i just think that she doesn't understand why it's such an issue. you need to explain to her that calling her ex her family instead of you straight up cuts you out of the picture. she can't expect to have anything with you in the future if she sees her ex as more than her baby's biological dad.|`|5VHWy0Ggaa	i'm not sure if you should break it off... but you should find out if she's cheating on you or something with him. it seems like she does care for him still, because she wouldn't randomly get his name tattooed on her, even if that is her baby's daddy... i don't know anyone who has gotten their baby's daddy's name tattooed on them, after they were broken up! she needs to realize that they are not family... and that she needs to move on or make up her mind. it's so stupid that she did that. as you said... i'd totally understand if it was just her baby's name... or maybe his too, if they were together. but they're not, and she's supposed to be your girl...<br>  <br>  after thinking about it. i would probably break up with her. it all depends on if she's cheating on you, and how much you love her. if she's cheating, leave her. if you really love her, and she's not cheating then you have a decision to make.|`|fYOWyIEXaa	Regardless of what happened between her and her ex he will always be apart of her life because of their child together. Even though she is not with him anymore doesn't mean she has to lose all feelings for him. She's with you and not him right.....So what's the big deal about the ink, it's her body and if down the road she regrets it it's her issue|`|kbkbDhwLaa	It's not the norm, but you have to accept the fact that he is in her life and always will be. He technically is family. I wouldn't be surprised either if she still had feelings for him. She has a child with the man. What I am surprised about is that you were shocked, or somehow only suspect that she still has feelings for him when she most likely does.|`|OYFoYDOaaa	DUMP HER BIG TIME! lol thats MAJOR disrespect. dump her with a bang!<br>  "always be her family" meaning your not part of her.<br>  and don't listen to whatever she says dude! shes in love with the guy, and resents not being with him.<br>  get rid of her! find yoruself a cleaner girl.|`|FI8tqUOAaa	First of all NEVER put ur loves name on ur arm. Love does not last forever. Now i understand putting the babies name on there. Ask her if she does have feelings for this man|`|PbPiF2p3aa	Sounds like she still has a thing for him. A little to weird if you ask me. I think I would consider movin on.|`|R4TeHZNUaa	The fact that she got it now, while she was with you, is a little . . . off. I know he will always be a part of her life since they have a kid but, that seems a bit much to me. : (|`|28q5KYpWaa	If you love her....... talk to her about it!
pQGUPITeaa	I have no idea - I've been told I talk a mile a minute, and I don't think it makes a lot of sense because my bf usually ends up laughing the whole time. <br>  <br>  He said I give a lot of very exaggerated compliments - um I guess I'm telling him how I feel!<br>  <br>  *blush*|`|dHH4Rl2yaa	their name, "right there" when they hit the spot, noises of enjoyment, vocalize if you want harder or faster, other dirty things that I won't say out loud.|`|0IhGanoZaa	you don't really need to say anything. but moan a little so he doesn't think he sucks in bed and when you liike something more than the otehr moan just that little bit harder to let him know you like it. you could throw in some other dirty words to keep it interesting but that might not be 'you thing'. i guess you could say LIKE That or don't stop. just let it come natural or see what he says sometimes. xD|`|R4TeHZNUaa	I usually don't say anything apart from his name, maybe a 'faster' every once and a while, and a 'yes' or two. I know, I'm cliche. ; )|`|HKtxjWV1aa	'Oh, oh, oh, oh'<br>  <br>  If you can have a good conversation you're not having good sex, lol...
r1IWKjFxaa	Hey, I'm sorry for what's been going on recently.  Drugs are a horrible thing sometimes.  What I think you should do (key words here, I think, follow your own heart) is get a legal divorce from your husband.  It will be rough on you and the kids, but as you say it has already basically happened, and the drug use and mood changes definitely warrant it.  Once that has finally hit the table you are free to date whomever you like without worry, you are officially split from any ties to him you once had.  You can start dating whomever you feel comfortable with, and though the transition will be rough your children might one day have a step father they can look up to.  You should not have to live alone simply because of one man.<br>  <br>  These are the words of a 20 year old single college student, but I hope I might have helped you in some small way.  Do what you feel is right.<br>  <br>  Good luck
joA5Rcyzaa	it's no big deal, in fact it'll probably help you find a guy who TRUELY loves you for who you are and not your breast size<br>  <br>  i have dated a few flat chested girls and it didn't bother me|`|HsWFqn1naa	"It is a scarcity value that the chest is small!<br>  it is status!<br>  one so-called "moe" element!

And yes, she has to be pretty too(she is).|`|9IyIO0Qkaa	it dont matter|`|R4TeHZNUaa	I know I'm not a guy, but I've had plenty of guy friends that actually like smaller breasts. According to one in particular, 'they stay perky longer'.
b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	Birth certificate no you don't change that would be impossible anyways all other forms of ID you do change. I went to the SS office to have my SS card changed over to my new name. And no you don't have to take your husbands name if you don't want to.|`|eeaXYyCNaa	No you don't have to change your name at all.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	I don't believe you need to change your birth certificate or can even.<br>  <br>  But drivers license, checks, social security, any utilities, credit cards, car registration, insurance policies, mortgage, etc all need to be changed. <br>  <br>  Get lots of copies of your marriage license to give to all of the above. There are checklists out there with everything that you will need to change so you don't forget anything important. Just do a google search and a bunch will pop up.<br>  <br>  Edit: The other posters are right in that you do not legally have to change your name at all. But if you are putting your name with your husbands last name on the marriage certificate then you will have to change your name on everything.|`|7Jxk9IZDaa	You cannot change the birth certificate and my wife chose to not change her last name,about 10 years later the IRS gave us immense problems until she did change her last name.This happened many years ago and may not be true today.|`|zAfKvhW4aa	No, you don't have to. It is only a custom followed by many.<br>  <br>  You do not need to. Infact, keeping your own last name would be keeping your own identity separate from some one else's (meaning your husband).|`|PshRhxqraa	I chose not to change my surname at all when we got married.  It's the easiest thing in the world - just do nothing!  I am in the UK.|`|ee2eb688bade7663b57e940f752dc454aa	You are NOT required by law to take your husband's name when you marry. You can keep and legally use your original (family) surname.<br>  Your birth certificate never changes.<br>  If you are taking your husband's name, you must change your identity papers (driver's license, passport, etc.). Make sure that everything is uniform, especially in these days of heightened airport security, for example.|`|fH5n6dw4aa	No, you don't have to change your name. I mean, this is the 21st century after all and not the 19th century. To me, a changing of the name is an outdated tradition which signifies ownership. I plan on keeping my name when I marry and giving my kids my name as well.|`|mNxHFOd4aa	no you don't have to change your last name to his if you don't want to, but if you're not willing to that out of love and respect for him - why are you even getting married?|`|ZjcH929kaa	Birth Certificate -- No<br>  State Issued ID -- Yes

aRIA86D8aa	I think you're over analyzing this whole thing. She's just making conversation. Don't think she is cold or shallow because she expresses an opinion, it's just that, an opinion.

Some guys think that majority of girls just put out and so he was probably taken back a little bit by you telling him you are a virgin.

It means that you respect yourself enough not to go out and sleep with just any random guy or guys.|`|epmg5WC0aa	his the one thats pathetic. a absolute idiot of a guy with no respect to females would say to someone. Your a virgin because u havnt found the right person, thats why. Im 18 and i have had a boyfriend for the past 5 months and we have just deceided to have sex and it was the best thing ever. im so happy with him, and he cares for me so much. just wait for the right person, and thats certainly not him! sorry to be blunt|`|1jIzBUkhaa	he was trouble there for a minute or two. good girls are hard to fine. don't be self conscious about this it is a good thing|`|ejuJiZAAaa	Dont feel bad, hes just bloody impressed and said it cause he was too dumbfounded to think of a better response. h<br>  <br>  he loves you
Yg1QR4mmaa	Screw this guy, there is no reason to apologize for this, if he wants trouble give him all he can handle. People like him make decisions like this and don't think about the repercussions, so if he even threatens you then you should give this guy a beating, and make sure to let him know that if he ever tries to pull something like this again, he is going to get another boot to the teeth. It is a harsh lesson but people who have lived sheltered lives and have never had to man up to the consequences of their own actions think they are on a pedastel above others and are immune to them, so show this prick that he is not, welcome him to the real world.

IoJNldUyaa	I did this only difference is we saw each other like twice or so a month. What we did is we did not over kill on the phone or internet so that when we did talk we had things to talk about. Give each other a little bit of space for things to happen in your lives that you will want to share with each other. Also don't be afraid to play around on the phone. My ex and I (as silly as this sounds) would play around as if we were two different people and go back and forth making up different scenarios. It was light hearted and actually kind of interesting being someone else hitting on my ex and hearing him say he was taken by me.|`|QlUNyK4Paa	i hate long distance relationships, there SO hard;<br>  i went out with my fran for like 8 months..<br>  but then we broke it off,<br>  but the good thing is were still frans<br>  more like bestfriends..<br>  he comes and visits me every summer and break.<br>  and we still like each other but arent going out.<br>  maybe you shuld tht.. just wait alittle.|`|ul6P8doWaa	Geees.........another online/long distance relationship....don't ppl ever learn?
Jqmyxmboaa	Depends on age.|`|ONorlRL1aa	its always more important to find someone that doesn't have an std and use protection.<br>  <br>  so.....your safest bet on that would be to go for a virgin, but in this part of the world with so many young people having sex in high school, and even middle school, i highly doubt its possible to find very many virgins out there.<br>  <br>   i mean even religious people are changing practices and having sex before marriage now, just because it's becoming harder to live young adult life without sex.<br>  <br>  I remember I had wanted my first time to be with a virgin, but i couldn't find any virgins my age even a few years younger all had lost their virginity in highschool or middle school. now it only matters to me that they have no stds, and that we use protection.<br>  <br>  of course for girls i think its pretty simple to have sex for the first time with an experienced person because really they're the ones poking you.<br>  <br>  as for guys, really really know what your doing if its your first time, i wouldn't suggest telling the girl you were a virgin. and know how to use a condom. It took me awhile to learn how to use that. its very ackward, and i can see why most people have sex without protection because of that. just learn how to use it and get the right brand thats all i can say.|`|7Jm2ZZGzaa	each side has their good and bad points. of course u wanna guy with sum experience but on the other hand, its kinda fun 2 be the 1st for sumone n kinda show em a few things<br>  <br>  if i HAD 2 pick i would go with a guy whos not a virgin though|`|np5R16RSaa	i want my guy to be  really experienced <br>  i dont want him to experience his first time with me because he will end up being with other girls to try it out tooo.|`|SimAO1IUaa	doesnt matter if i like the person but preferably id like my boyfriend to be experienced.. or as long as he knows what hes doing|`|cbt4I1cuaa	doesn't matter its all about how you feel|`|m2eHPeciaa	for a guy, no. i would like the guy im with to "know what he's doing"|`|O1lm79EFaa	no, not really.

EHujGe5Oaa	It used to happen to me too. Whenever my girl left for her place, i would really miss her. It was actually due to some insecurity and because i loved her too much. Nowadays i have been able to confirm that she loves me a lot, even may be more than i do. I love her too and am less worried when she leaves. <br>  <br>  Don't worry its called love, just try to find  out if she feels the same way.

hrU14wMDaa	That is a lot for someone your age to take on. I am assuming that you are a teenager.<br>  <br>  I don't see how your aunt could overreact as everything that your cousin is doing needs to be addressed quickly before something terrible happens to her. I'd rather see her overreact versus not reacting at all. Your cousin could get pregnant, acquire an STD, overdose on drugs, go to jail and unfortunately could very well die from what she is doing. <br>  <br>  You need to talk to her parents as difficult as that is. You will be doing your cousin a huge favor that maybe she won't realize until years later, but at least you know that you did something wonderful for someone that you obviously love. She is extremely lucky to have someone like you in her life. We should all be so lucky!<br>  <br>  You added additional information regarding the overreacting. Why do you think that your aunt would hit or abuse your cousin? Does your aunt not treat your cousin right? If your aunt does hit your cousin already, you need to go talk to a school counselor or another trusted adult and get them involved with trying to get your cousin the assistance that she needs. This really is a sad situation if your cousin is dealing with awful parents and is probably the reason she is acting out so badly. Poor child.|`|ow7ZVVPsaa	Alya, this is a situation where you really do need to be cruel to be kind.  Unfortunately for your cousin she really does need to hit rock bottom before she is going to even consider listening to anyone.  Your cousin is her own worst enemy at this point in time and to have a loving family member by her side (you) is not what she will appreciate right now.  Your auntie is going to freak out when she hits rock bottom but don't blame yourself for that - it is too big a responsibility for you to take on your own. Cheers!!|`|B9jLDyC7aa	you should punch her yourself show her how much she is going to mess her life up if she doesnt stop|`|klYCoFJVaa	I know how you feel- a close friend of mine went through the same thing.  Honestly, you could only do 3 things:  talk to your cousin personally.  Tell her that you're afraid for her and that she's too young to start on this downward spiral.  Look up some things on the internet the relate to her stories and the outcome of what happened to those people.  You could also talk to your aunt.  She may overreact, but it would be better than your cousin ending up ruining her life.  OR you could watch your cousin slowly kill herself, which as you said, you don't want to be told that there's nothing you could do.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.  Hopefully your cousin realizes the mistake she's making. :)|`|KxAmrVBfaa	You could talk to your aunt but i see why u would be torn up to tell her your cousin would prob be furious <br>  <br>  You could try and tell your Aunt pretending to be someone different <br>  <br>  Like sending your aunt some mail telling everything but just not saying whos it from just that your concerned|`|nMcjBv4saa	you could talk to her ,tell her what she is getting into ,maybe sit her down and go online and show her what drugs can do to her system and show her what she can catch from having sex with lots of different people ,if that doesnt work youll need to tell her mum because someone might hurt her|`|2uXNtCUlaa	pray for her ...and get her into rehab tell someone about her destructive path..don't keep it a secret you wont help her. don't give up on her...or she will give up on herself,tell her you love her. don't let the same hing that happened to Gia Carangi happen to your cousin.|`|al6K48oSaa	sO WHAT?1 Ciontinue letting her sleep with men.

738eb3523fcda7312e683aec70d06ce8aa	If the guy doesn't reciprocate your feelings, then worry more about your friendship than him. Trust me, you'll meet other guys in your life.|`|klYCoFJVaa	I'm not sure how old you are, because it kind of matters.  Teenagers, especially girls, tend to think that every emotion they feel towards the opposite sex is 'love.'  If you are a teenager, then there isn't much you can do about it.  This sort of thing happens to most girls, mostly those in high school.  If you're more mature and older (I hope so) then the only thing you can really do is talk to your friend and tell her that you care about him.  If he knows your feelings and returns them, than he will come to you when he feels ready.  If he tries to hook up with your friend, then your friend should know to respect you and refuse his offer to get together.

The Beauty of Social Network!  My friend - BE YOURSELF! <br>  I can imagine how you're feeling! Confused maybe, nervous at the same time, calculating your response, ALL BECAUSE you are not sure! Then again, sometimes it pays to JUST LET GO of any thoughts or inhibitions.<br>  <br>  If we take a look at the situation that you are in right now, or if we begin with the end in mind, it is always good to take a bit risk to showing not only this girl, but everyone else THE REAL YOU!   There are many reasons why, one of which is that, " IF" you started any type of relationship revealing comfortably who u truly are, then as the relationship progresses , you will not have a hard time at all.  Unlike , if you plan to show the " calculated you, in order to get a positive response" , chances are you might have a hard time, as the relationship progresses.<br>  <br>  This little practices takes time. You see, in the world of dating, I find it completely ODD that we only show our best character traits? More often than not, it gets a little complicated as the relationship evolves to a more serious one.  I always tell my friends, BE YOURSELF, every human being has his or her unique character , that was given for a purpose, it is a waste not to show it.<br>  <br>  In case that she decides not to hit on you again, isn't at all a LOST cause with what you did, you most definitely GAINED the insight<br>  of " getting to know yourself -MORE!"<br>  <br>  Happy My-spacing my friend.|`|5qdpmoTdaa	Tell her to meet you at a coffee shop.. perfect. <br>  <br>  <br>  tell her who you are and where you are at in life.. dont stress :D

Ad5DlqfPaa	First you need to be honest with her about how you feel and you owe this to yourself. I don't know that it would be fair to ask her to cut the relationship that she has had with this family but i do think that there has to be some compromise on both sides. The first thing in any relationship is communication so talk with her again and try to come up with a solution in which the both of you can live with. Let her know that you trust her but still this situation makes you uncomfortable. Honestly if she is not willing to meet you half way then re think if you want to continue with this relationship because i am a woman and if i love and respect the man i am in a relationship with i will take his feelings into consideration and would be willing to discuss this thing until we are both are satisfied. Her just saying that she is not doing anything wrong while continuing to do the same thing that she knows makes you uncomfortable communicates a lack of respect. So before you go and speak to her about it the next time, write down some things that you both may be able to agree on. If she still refuses to change her behaviour then maybe it is that she really does have more than a friendship with this guy or at least a desire to have more. Either that or her relationship with you is not important enough to distance herself from her "crush".|`|OadMCKfgaa	First off, you've been with this girl for 6 years, and she has a crush?  I would disagree with you there, because girls that love their men don't develop crushes.  If she liked him when she was younger, it doesn't count.<br>  I think you're overreacting over the whole situation, his family considers her family because of the fact they've known each other awhile.  Trust her, because what reason does she have to lie to you?  Also, back up, and don't be so jealous, because from this post, I can tell you lack trust in your girlfriend, and you have some jealous issues you need to work out.|`|AA11271128	Well as you said it is her long time crush.<br>  If you weren't dating her maybe she would date him.<br>  You have been dating the same girl for 6 years since you were 17.<br>  That is seriously too long to be dating anyone at your age.<br>  Get out there and date other girls, sow your oats play the field and get some experience of what the difference of other people are, learn your strengths and weaknesses and theirs.<br>  Have fun and enjoy life.  But at your age you are way too young to be going on with the same girl.  People have many many girlfriends and boyfriends in their life.  Get out there and meet new people!|`|c325AREXaa	it's not wrong to be jealous,if this happens to me,i'll also be jealous and probably have a fight with my boyfriend.if you find it hard to convince yourself to trust her,just tell her.dont always try to cover up your unhapiness.if you do so,the problem will always be there and even swells up.it's better to get the problem solved or you'll constanly feel insecure and verge to break up.GOOD LUCK!|`|uqSbj8WQaa	I think you have the right to be upset if you know she has feelings for that guy, hes not just a friend.

That's a long time to be dedicated to her.  If you've been together for so long, then you should know by now to trust her.

Don't do as much as you're doing for him.<br>  <br>  Maybe that will make him realize things a bit and start to put some effort into it himself.|`|VvNKTFhJaa	may be you are not providing space to him where he could "put efforts".|`|FzFSzilmaa	sounds like he doesn't need to do anything cos you are doing it all...|`|QlUNyK4Paa	mmh.. maybe he isnt very open.. and just hang in there he  mite soften up.|`|kl2oIIEEaa	sounds like hes just using you|`|AA11452969	Sweetie. There's no need to worry for him. Its you who you needs to worry of. You are putting too much effort for him and you know it already then why cant you see that this is the problem? And he never ask you to do this things for sure. right? It is you who keep on doin this if you really want to do this things you shouldnt be complaining, if you will then why dont you just stop? Do yourself a favor and Give yourself a break can yah? for sure when he noticed that you're not doing as much as you always do for him he will ask and wonder. and might push him to at least do something. some guys are really like this. They dont want to do anything for you because you're already doing it for the relationship. This shouldnt be all work it should be fun and happy right? stop being unfair to yourself and dont blame your BF even. You cannot change things by yourself. So all u need to do is to free yourself from doing things that u will just resent. cheer up. this is how i did wit my ex bf before. at the end when i broke up wit him cuz i got tired and doesnt want to do anything about us anymore he came begging and asking for a chance. but sorry, i found my own happiness already. so for you, as early as now, do the right thing before u even get tired and feel wasted. stop and let him do some work.=)|`|ofEb1uRLaa	Well, your boyfriend sounds weird... it's not good of him to do all of that to you. He says he loves you but I'm not sure if he really means it. You deserve somebody better than him. It's like you're doing everything to him and he doesn't do anything to you. I mean... this relationship will not hold for too long. If he doesn't change his behaviour against you, I think you should tell him that you need a pause. I don't know you, but I want you to feel comfortable with your boyfriend.|`|21g5bHfvaa	Have you told him any of this, and I don't mean with hints or being subtle because as guys we don't understand subtle.  He may have no idea that you don't like him not doing those things and he may think that you just like to do that stuff.  The birthday and Christmas things are un-excusable but the rest he may have no idea he is doing wrong.|`|EHujGe5Oaa	The only reason you need to leave is his excuse that its your fault he's mean to you. <br>  <br>  You seem a very nice person and shouldn't waste your time with someone who doesn't appreciate.<br>  <br>  There are many other guys out there who would die to have a girl who takes care of them like that.|`|2vgbJhlRaa	OMG!!! why are you still with him!?!?! find a man who appreciates you for you! he doesnt do any effort because your his mom! and are you?!?! he has you wrapped around your little finger so why should he do anything? bottom line is if you want it to work out then you have to stop pampering him...just stop. best of luck|`|U3lxRnjnaa	Try to sit down in a peaceful and quiet manner, discuss with him face to face.

There's many ways to fix this but the simpliest and fastest would be the ignore game. It either fix it or shatter it. Write him a letter of "how you feel" plus the things he needs to do to get his *** together.For example, the one in your question plus a bit more details would work and to mention "you deserve someone better than his ***". Give it to him when there's a chance and leave right away, don't say a word. If he loves you he gonna apologize and change, if he doesn't.... it's about time to get a new BF.

C8DOT8Y7aa	1 Make sure you really want to reconcile. A husband who's cheated on you for the second time or a best friend who talked about you behind your back—yet again—are people you might not want to let back into your life. Make sure you can take that leap of faith that the person won't make this mistake again, and that you care about them enough to continue a relationship with them. <br>  2 Assess the apology itself. Make sure they explain what the apology is for. An apology for being late to dinner when the real crime was sneaking into the neighbor's house for a rendezvous shows the person does not grasp what she did wrong—and is likely to do the same thing. If the apology fits the crime, you can accept it. <br>  3 Realize that heartfelt apologies are gifts to you. It's true that the person did something wrong, but admitting it and the guilt and shame that comes along with an apology is a tough thing for most people to do. To apologize is to humble yourself in hopes of winning back someone's trust <br>  4 Forgive the person in your heart first. Saying, "It's OK" and then stewing about what they did wrong for years is destructive and wrong. Instead, think carefully about the person's apology and be sure you trust it won't happen again before committing to forgiveness. <br>  5 Tell the person you forgive him and trust the incident will never happen again. Then put it out of your mind completely and focus on the positive aspects of your relationship. Should the person make the same mistake again, you might not want to accept his apology—but until that happens, give him a blank slate.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	why would you expect him to phone you during the wee hours of the morning?  stupid stupid!!!  <br>  <br>  learn from your mistake.  move on.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	You can't turn back time, you just have to learn from your mistakes and not dwell on it.<br>  <br>  You didn't even make it to a first date, this was not a relationship.  Perhaps it's a good thing, if you are really insecure you are not ready for a relationship.  Work on your insecurities before you get involved with people.|`|FaNmIRmPaa	You never even met the guy, you need to start seeing people in real life. Don't force a relationship, don't go out on a man hunt, just let things work their way and something will happen. You have no emotional obligation to this guy, you have nothing secure between you.|`|6w8jfI7Uaa	what was the message- i can only help if you tell us!|`|ESsQeH8Aaa	Ah, but you CAN'T turn back the clock, can you?<br>  <br>  As he seems to have had an attack of common sense, it would appear that there is no apology that he will accept.<br>  <br>  Relationship is terminated.<br>  <br>  However, not all is lost.<br>  <br>  You did make a HUGE error in the relationship, and this error made the relationship dissolve.  Ok, yes,... sad to be sure, but this is an important lesson for you in your future relationships.<br>  <br>  LOSE THE INSECURITIES.   No guy likes dealing with a psychotic female.  (and even if your not actually psycho, your little text message apparently spoke a different story)<br>  <br>  Best of luck on the next one.
dKLZvQyQaa	First, do you really LOVE her or just have a major crush on her? How can you love someone whom you have seldom spoke to and does not know the person's personality well? Love has to be developed overtime, and from what you've said, I think you just have an infatuation with the girl.<br>  <br>  Anyway, don't rush things between the both of you. Get to know her better, and befriend her. Perhaps you can start off by talking about school - no personal issues - , like talk about teachers, homework. Be natural, be yourself. You have to make her like you for who you are. Don't prepare what you're going to say because you never know how she will reply.<br>  <br>  Don't do anything that'll spoil the relationship between her and her boyfriend. Let things run naturally. If they break up because of their own reasons, well, then go ahead and ask her out. If they are still together, I'm sorry but I think you have to be satisfied with just being a close friend of hers :)|`|gfjgTQipaa	hummm it seems u are getting greedy...or u really like the girl..the perfect way that i have experimented on many grls..is....it takes a few days and weeks but its worth it !! now first thing u gotta do is be confident..coz if u are not u look wiered..image u go to say hi and u a "a" "a" a" and the girl thinks u are fool...so dont let this happen ok..be cool..she is just a grl..next thing is u sit next to her may be be besides or in from or just back of her.. i would preffer back or besides..just say hi...give her a nice small smile...a frinedly one ok..so u are on the right track if she smiles back...but if u are really scared and u think u cant do this..just ask for the|`|yl3udnsLaa	just try to make friends with her and dont be shy.<br>  Then if the two of you are close enough, tell her what you feel.<br>  Gain more confidence.|`|IfZHnE3Taa	try to talk with herfor class subjects.

Maybe with time and treatment, he'll get his bipolar condition to a manageable state and his behavior will improve.  But she's by no means responsible for his happiness or sanity.|`|2svonkw1aa	she really needs to get out of the relationship. it might hurt him but staying is hurting her and is extremely unhealthy for her. this boyfriend needs serious help before he gets in another relationship.|`|6w8jfI7Uaa	Just talk to him quietly about how they need to be less clingy.<br>  If it gets unbearable- tell her not to stay with him out of sympathy.<br>  Answer mine? <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmC8vip7nrjSo9uYM65w.Nzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223043136AAdHye5">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  Please... answer it.

Because they have complexes, everything is about complex with men.<br>     True love is rare. Seek for true love. In the first year of a relationship you MUST know if he's the one. Don't make more compromises than he makes. You are unique. You are someone. If he does not realise that, leave him running.|`|2svonkw1aa	i think that he's trying to 1. not hurt you any more than he already has or 2. decide whether or not he wants to get back with you... just give him time to process everything.

Simple: "I want you back! My family is not a problem! They'll accept you if you continue to make me happy! I can't stand this anymore" End of conversation! And if he doesn't say something just make him feel he loses you for well. Stop talking anymore with him! Disappear and move on when you are ready! It is the normal way!<br>  <br>  Remember that this isn't "How to get him back". It is "How to make clear what he feels". You might lose him or make him admit he loves you. But the only sure is that you'll know!|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	he wants you to continue to want him but he doesnt really want to commit to you.  he wants his freedom, but he wants you to be tied to him.  men are controlling that way.   blaming your family is a cop out.<br>  he's very immature still.  some of us never grow out of it.|`|ZG3Xiup3aa	it sound like he didn't want to talk to you for good becuz he was probably mad about something.|`|q7p6aBXMaa	If you two were together for so long you cant just stop having feelings for someone just like that..

You can manage dating and studying if you actually try.  If dating him makes your grade drop then you know you need to spend less time with him and more time in the books.  That doesn't mean you have to break up with him...|`|5XUnyNWGaa	You could always be like Romeo and Juliet, without the tragic ending of course. <br>  Just see eachother at school.. and go out on secret dates. Its hard to be young and in love with someone, because nobody believes you!!!|`|NweoIIcdaa	Nooo don't break up, follow your heart!<br>  <br>  You'll still have plenty of time for studying.<br>  <br>  He could be your soul mate, hold onto him.|`|cx3JwCgraa	First, at such a young age, the chances of him being the one forever is slim and blah blah blah all that stuff you heard before. I figured I should get that out of the way early before you get 30 answers that say exactly that.<br>  <br>  Moving on, you have to consider two things. You are 14, and your parents still have the right to tell you what to do. Secondly, you are at an age where you can be told something and do the exact opposite and probably get away with it.<br>  <br>  It's really up to you to decide what kind of relationship you want. Do you want to be open, do you want to hide behind closed doors, do you think you two can wait until a later time to pick up where you leave off? I have a feeling that if you think hard on this, you will know the answer you need.
dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	dont know.  maybe youre like a dad or big brother or mentor type for her.  ??|`|2XTkSV4daa	Either she is a confused girl or she just is a good friend. I'm going to say she might be confused and trying to get you to like her more by saying she doesn't like you. Better have a talk with her.|`|AA11843942	i believe she cares for you as a friend, even though she may not have feelings for you in the way that you want.  She doesn't want to loose you as a friend.  If you truly want to be her friend than just tough it out.  if you feel that you cant be friends with her because of your feelings than you need to distance yourself.|`|fszr8F7laa	If she cares 4 u.. in such manner.. so definitely she has feelings 4 you..|`|5snO0Yngaa	she sounds immature to me.<br>  I believe that if you want to be "happy in love" then only give your emotions away to someone that deserves it. otherwise you will end up hurt.<br>  This girl like the attention you give her.<br>  However, she does not like you enough to do anything about it.<br>  I would put my energy into someone else.<br>  Sometimes we can feel an attraction to someone but not get it returned. It takes maturity to recognise this and takes self respect to walk away and decide that you deserve better treatment, especially if you are to invest emotions and time into someone.<br>  Good luck with finding love in your life.
zuOqbkdEaa	plenty more fish in the sea|`|AA12346188	Find another boy friend ASAP.|`|0AShsMsoaa	from the very very beginning you gave years of your life to someone who clearly told you he didnt know if he wanted a commitment to you.  for your future reference, translated, that means he does not want you.  despite this,  you lived with and hung around someone who likes to hang around but is very clear he wants no other commitment.  you put yourself in a silly, powerless position here.  you lose.  he wins.  <br>  <br>  learn from this. establish your priorities and needs up front. if the other person isnt interested move on.  <br>  <br>  there is nothing to be heartbroken about. this guy has done you a huge favor.  he didnt use you, he didnt lie to you, you yourself refused to see reality staring you in the face.|`|tsBL19qzaa	Get over it and move on.

Better to get it over with now, rather than waste a few more years, just because you are afraid of being heartbroken.|`|VC7PyH53aa	Throw his a** out and start anew.|`|J74Y5LKxaa	For starters, I can never understand why women are always shocked and disappointed that their live in boyfriends of 2+ years see no value in getting married.  And why should they?  You're already sleeping togther, you're already living together, you're already cooking & cleaning, and you're already sharing expenses.  Why get married?  Why would a guy suddenly want to pay for something he's been getting for free until now? <br>  <br>  My advice if you want this guy back (and even if you don''t) is to find your OWN place.  Be independent.  Be busy.  Be happy.  But TRUST ME.....if you pine away for him, act as if you're devistated, and beg for him to reconsider, the only thing you're doing is showing him that YOU need HIM.  Maybe a few weeks without you will make him realize what he just allowed to slip away, and actually step up.  But only when there is a ring on your finger should you even think of moving back in with him.  Something you SHOULD have done in the first place.|`|UFOdwXgfaa	I've been dating mine for 12 years and he was the one who called the quits last week. <br>  <br>  What would you in my position ?

Of course It's not easy, there's self doubt, you feel like a failure, you feel like picking up on the phone and checking up on how he is doing etc.. Telephone is your enemy especially when it comes to your ex. By calling him you are showing him weakness.

You just had a dispute about what you both want in the relationship. Did he say something to make you think that he might want marriage and children with someone else in the future but he doesn't see it being with you? "he doesn't think he wants that (with me)." So he doesn't want it with you but could want it with someone else? If this is how he feels after 2.5 years then he obviously doesn't care for you as deeply as you thought. You need to have another discussion. A serious one with no alcohol involved.|`|uzfdgFSxaa	Start over.  If you have been dating for 2.5 years and the talk of marriage and children make him uncomfortable - walk away.  Find someone that has the same priorities and dreams that you have.  Don't invest anymore time into this relationship.  Not saying you can't be friends, but you are 30 and don't have the luxury that he has when it comes to bearing children.  Move out of your condo as soon as you can get rid of it and start fresh.  Don't waste your precious time on a man that can't make up his mind by now.  You have the right to be happy and to make your own dreams come true.  Good luck.|`|goY0JHzlaa	First, let me say that I'm sorry this happened to you. But, why stay with someone who doesn't want the same as you? You will be waiting and waiting for that marriage that just may not happen.

Did you guys talk about what he said after he sobered up? Thinking about what you are going to do about your home or how you are going to heal your broken heart can be tough. But think about it, do you really want to waste precious time with someone who doesn't share the same desires in life as you do? You owe it to yourself to be with a person who wants marriage and wants children. Think about the future, if you do patch it up and stay together will you regret it when you are 50 and have no children, or will he break it off with you when its already too late to move on and have children with someone who loves you. Its pretty selfish of him to be in a relationship with you for 2 1/2 years if he has no intentions of taking the next step.

eL268hETaa	Open honest communication on BOTH SIDES is needed.  Be truthful about your likes and dislikes, and ask them to be honest about theirs.  If you cannot compromise for the sake of the relationship, then you have no relationship.  Stop worrying about predicted responses.  Just tell the truth and lay your cards on the table.  See if they still want to play the game.  If not, at least you know where you stand and you didn't have to pretend.|`|2ba40000b05c80f1026052730a2733afaa	Why are you writing in the plural.........them instead of he or him?  <br>  <br>  I don't think you love him.  Maybe at one time you did, but now the love is over.  He has stated he will not change.  He is trying to dominate you, first by saying how he wants to be with you and you, silly girl, said you'd wait for him.  Now expects his wife back and you don't want to be there.  <br>  <br>  You've got a problem.  Ignoring him will make him mad and in turn injure you.  <br>  <br>  You cannot change him. Quit dreaming.  If he will not change on his own, there is no relationship here and he should not be returning to you.  Move on with your life, while you still have one.|`|1Acv3PbWaa	When two people get togather, they should realize that each are their own person.<br>  Do not get togather with some one who needs to "CHANGE"<br>  accept that people are different.<br>  If you can't love a person for who they are and feel they or you must change, then its not really love.<br>  After all , one cannot find the PERFECT mate as the PERFECT one just might be looking for the PERFECT one also.<br>  And as we all know, NO ONE IS PERFECT.<br>  <br>  if they love you and you love them  then you and them must accept each other as you are.|`|DYw2tYUJaa	First of all honey who is them?

The brain uses this nifty chemical to make a neurotransmitter called serotonin which does many things, including producing feelings of bliss and euphoria. Translation: Chocolate makes you feel good.

That's kind of wrong of you to just sit around waiting for her to break up with her boyfriend .. waiting for her to get hurt? <br>  <br>  Don't do either .. she's probably not just saying this to be nice unless ..

Try to know her heart that she is really like her or just a normal crush.<br>  <br>  2. If she likes so suggest her to talk that guy so u can be her good friend in her point of view.<br>  <br>  3. But you can say one thing more in smiley way: don't worry if he shows you negative response then I am here to be your BF" then you can know her reaction. <br>  <br>  If she asks seriously then you can say YES but also need to say that “I like you & I am not pressuring you, if you like that guy so pls go a head as I am still happy if you are happy with that guy & will remain your friend”.<br>  <br>  Girls like straight answers instead of rolling answers.<br>  <br>  PLS SAY ABOVE LINES WITH YOUR DIRECT EYE CONTACT.<br>  <br>  If same time she likes you then she can accept your offer OR then just support her.<br>  <br>  LINE: no one can get his/her desired love BUT who gets is one of the luckiest people of this world.<br>  <br>  Bye & Tc<br>  Mayank|`|AA10317249	sit with her, if she says she wants to sit with you than sit with her.|`|xtX7aaLqaa	umm 1?|`|2C3oamkaaa	The simplest answer is amost always the best answer. If she wants to sit next to you, sit next to her. No harm can come from it. If she breaks up with her guy and goes for you, then lucky you.|`|pniD82bQaa	Honestly, I would sit with her. Even if anything doesnt happen between you guys, its better to be friends than not at all. And if things are meant to be, it will happen. <br>  <br>  As well if I were you, I'd tell you how you feel...|`|FI8tqUOAaa	I think the first one is the best. If she said she likes sitting with u then trust her. You should stay by her side if she gets broken.|`|A7SCkuvEaa	move in if she turns you down oh well sh#t happens
CDzStUPUaa	If she isn't smiling all  the time or being flirty ... yeah, give her up.  If she doesn't seem cheerful around you she's either   bored or  IS simply a boring person.  Or maybe she's just too into herself.  <br>  Sorry, that's how I see it from what you've written.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	there is no way u can make it up to him, being sorry won't mean a thing now, because your husband has lost u, and your marrying the other  man. in time your husband will move on, and find someone else because god never shuts one door without making it possible for the person hurt to find a new door and  a new way. god will forgive u, but that would not take away the consequences of it. u still will have to pay the piper. it could be that the misery u gave your husband will follow u into your new marriage. u can never compensate him, it wouldn't mean a thing to him. can't un ring a bell, can't put it back where it use to be once u do it. it will effect how your husband feels and views the world, will effect his next relationship too. u could have stopped all this at one time, but now its too late to say a thing.|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	He will go on with his life broken hearted. He didn't deserve it and now he has to deal with pain of what  YOU did.  Do you think by compensating him in some way is going to make him feel better. Its not...and the only reason you want to is to make yourself feel better. Just leave him alone and let him go on with his life. I am sure he is strong man and before long , he will have someone new in his life that he can trust and that will be faithful to him. Even though it is going to take him a long time to ever trust again, it can be done. I should know, I did it. My husband did this to me and the only way he could have ever compensated me would be to have given me his balls in a mason jar...|`|veZLfnGFaa	There's no compensation for adultery.  You don't have to pay him anything .  I'm sure he's gotten enough of you by now.  Adultery is wrong, morally and legally.   Yes, in some states it's against the law.

He needs to understand so if there were mistakes he made in the marriage, he can correct them so it doesn't happen again.  YOU need to understand so that you are not tempted to commit adultery on your next husband.<br>  <br>  God forgives.  You need your ex-husband's forgiveness before you can forgive yourself.   Help him to understand why it happened.|`|pbvDkV1Maa	so then why did you do that to him? there is no compensation for that. that is terrible. he deserves better and i hope he finds it.<br>  god does not hate you. he knows humans make mistakes, sometimes real bad ones. he will always offer forgiveness if you ask. you should also ask your  ex husband and ask his forgiveness and ask him if there is anything you can do for him.<br>  do you feel ashamed of yourself at all for doing that? i hope you and have learned a lesson.<br>  what are you gonna do if your soon to be hubby does that to you? and he probably will and you will see how it feels. if he cheated with you knowing you were married he has no morals either and doesn't take marriage seriously either.<br>  If someone cheats with you they will also do it to you.|`|EdDLydH7aa	I think as long as you repent for your sins all is forgiven by God, but you won't know that until you meet him so there really isn't any sense in stressing about things us humans can't answer and as far as your husband goes, he will get over it eventually but that's nothing you can control either, like someone else said just pray for him and tell him how sorry you are for cheating on him and ask his forgiveness all you can do is ask, he doesn't have to give it to you but at least you put it all out there...compensation for cheating, divorce...and you've done that so it's time to just move on...do you have to marry this guy now b/c you cheated with him or b/c you really love him i think is the bigger question...b/c if you are just doing it to get back into your fellowship then that's not the right thing to do either...good luck|`|jTtNE6dmaa	I'd post this in the Religion section for more appropriate answers.|`|MfIz3TPVaa	i think you should discuss this matter with the elders inyour congregaton|`|mNxHFOd4aa	How about you pay HIM some alimony?|`|1oxRePmoaa	i would surely kill my wife if she commit adultry.|`|1d7368f7c75bdd5ae5033f1f40dcc63faa	You have at least four different issues, and each must be dealt with separately.<br>  <br>  First, your church (LDS?) is kicking you out.  I assume they’re doing so because they think that you’re so great a sinner that they don’t want to be seen with you anymore.  I personally believe this is wrong because the Bible clearly tells us that Jesus came to minister to sinners, not to those who think that they’re religiously “good”.  The Bible also tells us that we’re all sinners, and that committing only the smallest sin is as bad to God as committing the greatest sin.  As a result, while you’ve sinned greatly, the people in your previous church are no better than you (that’s what God’s word says!).  If I were you, I’d immediately find myself a new church (different, Bible-believing denomination) that isn’t ashamed to admit that they’re all sinners, and that will welcome the opportunity to continue to show you God’s way despite your past.<br>  <br>  Second, you engaged in adultery, which is very bad.  The Bible tells us that you must repent in order to gain God’s forgiveness.  The Bible tells us that true repentance consists of turning 180 degrees away from your sin, and as a result, turning towards God’s way.  Turning away from your sin isn’t just recognizing and admitting that it’s wrong, but rather it means that you must turn away from it in your heart and behavior.  As well, in order to truly turn towards God’s way, you must truly accept God’s way as your way, and in order to do that you must accept Jesus as your savior.  If turn to God and accept Christ, and truly repent of your sin, and ask God for forgiveness with your repentant heart, the Bible says that God promises to forgive you *completely*.  <br>  <br>  Thirdly, you cannot “pay off” your husband for the enormous disrespect you’ve shown him.  You can only apologize with a truly repentant heart.  He might accept it, or he might not, however it is all you can do.  Your infidelity is likely too bad for him to overcome, but you can’t change that now.  You’ve ruined his life and broken his heart.  You have no choice but to live with it and the consequences of your destroyed marriage.<br>  <br>  Lastly, you said that you’re going to continue the relationship with the man with whom you’ve committed your great sin.  However, to do so clearly is not consistent with truly repenting of your sin.  You simply cannot turn away from your adultery while continuing the adulterous relationship.  If you are not saved by true faith in Christ, then your destiny is the Lake of Fire regardless of your sin.  However, if you are saved by Christ, then God won’t punish you in the afterlife, but he very likely will punish you in your life here on earth, just as the Bible tells us he did time and time again to the multitude of unrepentant sinners throughout the Bible.  You must truly repent to get right with God now and forever.|`|CHazGLY3aa	you can't compensate your ex husband all you can do is apologize and be sincere about it..as far as how god views you, it depends on how you view your god...from what i hear god is very forgiving

I used to tell myself that I would never ever get over him and thats just the way it was going to be. This lasted for 3 freaking years. But I just dealt with it day by day and eventually it seems to fade. Also I met a new guy when I 18 and that helped because I loved him alot. Since then of course I'm not with him, but I have special people in my life and I realize that I am in control of my feelings and I will never let another GUY have that power on me, unless I want it. I'm currently dating a guy I want to be with for the rest of my life and no one else even flashes in my mind.

YbwDFvEaaa	You've really only being completely out of the relationship with him for a month...when you broke up you said it was around Christmas, which was really only about 2 full months ago, and on top of that you were seeing each other a bit a month ago. <br>  <br>  You just need to give yourself more time. Including the off-and-on period you were together 10 months, that's almost a year! You will need more than a month or two to get over your relationship with him. You'll find that the longer you're distanced from him, the less you will think about him, and you will move on from him completely in time. Just don't contact him, avoid situations where you may run into each other and end up in an awkward place, etc. You'll be fine!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|oOyXJtNvaa	You wont be able to get him out of your head for a very long time.<br>  I was only with my ex for like just over a month but when he cheated on me and we split up i was thinking about him constantly.

Avoid him...<br>  <br>  I doubt that you said hurtful things or that he broke up with you because of your laptop. Those are 2 small issues that could have been healed if he really cares about you.  It sounds like he just wanted an excuse to be out there being a whore.<br>  <br>  <br>  Please answer mine: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiVrY05mwGZkfHHBBxRwZ9Lsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222151649AAzjM8n">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|LtV82yU5aa	Why would you keep going back to this guy.

mefxIQP9aa	Yeah, you should leave. He's going to end up killing you one day.<br>  <br>  Arguments shouldn't get that heated unless it's over money or the kids not whose turn is it to wash the dishes.|`|fbvBzccJaa	It is. If you are in a relationship with someone they should never use their hands to hurt or  intimidate you. Intimidation is emotional abuse.  He sounds like he may have some anger management issues. The hitting himself part is also a sign that something is wrong. Its kind of like a girl cutting herself to feel in control. <br>    do you have a counselor you can talk to.  All high schools and colleges have them.  there are also community mental health services that offer counseling on a sliding scale.|`|72UNDrwkaa	you leave him straight away, and tell someone like a close friend or family member, because no matter what anyone says that is DEFINITELY abuse, don't let him talk you into going back to him trust me no matter what he says he will do it again,(i no from personal experiences) if they have done something once and you go back to them they will do it again, be strong xx|`|Y5qZCpl0aa	He didn't mean to hurt you but he did. And a man should never ever lay a hand on you. Yes it is abuse.. It seems like he has some anger issues and I'll tell you now girl those don't go away. He should have never hurt you even if he didn't mean to he still did it. I know you care about him but think about next time you make him mad. It only gets worse|`|bYGx8xdVaa	maybe,but i think he needs a psychology expert cuz he's really sick...im not joking he cant control himself as i see|`|oxsawg31aa	Leave his sorry ***. Any man that lays a finger on his gf/wife is scum. Are u gonna tell urself its ur own fault the next time he puts u in hospital?

Oh and the line "he said he'll never do it again" how many times are u gonna hear that, and actually believe it. What are u gonna do if u have children with this man, and they get to see their daddy hitting on their mommy, growing up to believe thats ok. Get out now, tell him if he doesnt get help, then there is no chance of u and him being together, cuz right now ur letting him walk all over u, he knows whenever he does something like this, ur gonna let him. If he loses u maybe he will wise up|`|jvMsQFCvaa	This sounds like abuse to me. I have never heard of someone grabbing someone else, and then falling over. What I HAVE heard of is people wrestling others to the floor. When this is instigated by a man over a woman, it isn't the man who is going to get hurt.<br>  <br>  I believe the generally held belief is that domestic violence is unnaceptable, and that you should leave. It is, however, entirely your choice.|`|qPfhXZw0aa	If you marry this guy he WILL start hitting you! Im sure he has said that it wouldnt happen again previous times before this last incident, right? You need to get out of this relationship! Im so sorry that you are so confused right now, and that your boyfriend...the man you love.... is the one doing this to you. It is painful. Just know that there are wonderful guys out there who can treat you right. No matter what the situation is... he should never lay his hands on you! Good luck honey! Ill pray for you!|`|xCfHnQBbaa	That to me is abuse.  Just because he hasnt hit you yet does'nt mean he won't.  Him hitting himself i think is just a way to let anger out by not hitting you.

Even if he has never hit you, he is physically hurting you and that counts as abuse. What bothers me the most is that after breaking your collar bone, he ran away. He was worried about himself over you, even though you were in serious pain. I don't think this guy is worth it, leaving you when you need him the most, especially since it was his fault, shows that he is self-centered and cares much more about himself than he does about you. I have been in your position, and the abuse only gets worse. Its only a matter of time before he stops holding back, so get out of there while you still can.|`|yiUNN8ADaa	He sounds like he has a lot of anger issues that need to be resolved. He should seek help from a therapist. He should never grab you or hold you down or anything like that if you don't want him to. If you even have to wonder, you know it's abuse. He's hitting himself now, but who knows if that could be you later down the road. Don't let it get to that point. Tell him he has to go to anger management or it's over.|`|pRaem8Kuaa	get out while you can.. so far it seems that he has been hitting him self to ikeep from hitting you but one day that might not work. and when you were hurt and in pain he didnt try to help you he just made it about himself. that shows that he doesn't care much about you.|`|zO59ezH3aa	If he loved u in the first place he would have never laid a hurtful hand on u so dump his a**|`|l9wTE5eCaa	Grabbing you and shaking you IS abuse. When I get into fights with my significant other, I don't hit or beat or grab or touch. I might hit the wall, but not the person. <br>  <br>  Also, his behavior when you broke your collar bone is also unacceptable. First of all, it is his fault that your collar bone is broken. He grabbed YOU, and caused you to fall on your collar bone. He should have taken you to the hospital immediately, instead of leaving you to go to the other room. I understand that it was stressful, but he should have the mental capacity to realize that you are seriously hurt.<br>  <br>  I think you need to separate from him because the violence will only escalate. Since he routinely grab you during arguments, it is not like this is his first time manhandling you. I know it might be difficult, but it is for the best, and you will find other people who will treat you better.

My friends find that astounding.|`|Gjyd1W5Waa	no|`|kxmx1BvTaa	Mine is Chace Crawford and Zac Efron!!<br>  <br>  They are soooo HOOOOOOT!|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	its not odd. just wanted to share. eric dane from greys anatomy. soooo damn sexy|`|JF343E2Taa	philip schofield george michael and ray winstone|`|F4kFUxd1aa	I think most people go through that phase. Mine was on Justin Timberlake and Orlando Bloom.
rLFmDQezaa	This is always a toughy... it could go one of two ways:<br>  <br>  She's trying to make you jealous by rubbing it in your face so that you want to be with her still, so that you won't go out with anyone else.<br>  <br>  -or-<br>  <br>  She's trying to make you jealous so that you miss her and ask her out again.<br>  <br>  My suggestion would be to just talk to her casually and feel out the situation before you ask her out again.|`|uFmrZbCbaa	Ignore her, jealousy is a wasted emotion used by immature people. If she really liked you she would most likely tell straight up !|`|9QZ9Ie1Jaa	be confident , dont play her games , she must not be happy with herself or not confident enough .|`|zYGJh5Odaa	you should do the same thing to make her jelouse or ignore her and act like you dont care.|`|onOZ76esaa	askk herrrr.<br>  you'll never know if you dont.<br>  and i bet you that you'll regret it.<br>  <333|`|dO4xX4Hvaa	It depends on what your into. If your the kind of guy that like to play "games" then go right ahead and play along. But if you want to be straight up and honest with her about how you feel then you should do that and keep in mind that relationships that begin with games and dishonesty don't really last that long.|`|x8DoOgEoaa	It's a good thing that you can see what's going on.  The less you react over it, the more she'll try and eventually become frustrated and make a complete fool of herself if she hasn't already.  At that point it will become apparent to everyone else that she's trying to make you jealous.  Sit back and enjoy the ride...there's no hurry for you to do something.  In no time, you and her will be an item.|`|bld4u9Lcaa	Theres no harm in playing along if you are SURE she is making you jealous. If she likes you, be nice... You never know you might begin to like her back. But you'll know when its getting too intense; if you begin to notice she/you are only in it for the "game" then break it off. It's better neither of you getting hurt =]|`|M2KHsSkDaa	If you really like her, then you can ask her out. but if you are not really sure about it, then don't cause you might hurt her feelings. Since she's trying to make you jealous, show to her that you're not by ignoring her and stuff.|`|gQe01CHCaa	IGNORE HER. Pretend that you no longer care and she will stop. If you show her that it affects you she will keep doing it. Once you ignore her... you will see her true colors.|`|laACUQRPaa	i think u should just ignore her then if it carries on ask her if she still likes u or if she is being awkward and just go from there or you could just say look do u like me or not|`|paV2LdR9aa	If you like her. well, yeah...|`|jaOEtAHKaa	Play along for a while.... And then play your card... But dont u hurt her|`|f6OOxJQsaa	yes, do that.
uvcqPfuNaa	It is typically guys who lack confidence who like clingy girls. They then think this girl really wants me and are really pleased by her devotion.|`|VZVGXRyraa	I never used to, i hated how my past girlfriends wanted to be attached at my hip. But once i met my fiancee it all changed and we were both pretty clingy, always wanted to be together and if we couldn't be together were always texting each other.<br>  <br>  We're just very attached.|`|4bAZW3F6aa	depends on the clinginess|`|dSTQnHPraa	yeah, depends.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	Sometimes.<br>  I know that's not much help, but it kinda depends|`|UHc3Nvaqaa	I dont know any normal guy who wants a clingy girl.
k0Ewe7mCaa	You can trust me.|`|Plz4T3fzaa	Have you ever seen what Lexie Carver did to her husband in 2004-2006? (look up her name on Wikipedia)<br>  It's a great example of the kinds of things that can convince woman treat men wrong in all ways.|`|S8FjI00vaa	Because you're probably looking to hard. The best things come to those who wait. Trust me, when you stop looking so hard for someone special the right person will suddenly enter your life. It's kinda like when your in a rush to get somewhere like school or work and you can't find your keys so you start searching everywhere for them but cannot find them. Once you relax and pay more attention you see them right in front of you. Justy wait it out and try not to put all your focus on finding her.|`|mbeniuLqaa	ITS NOT HARD TO FIND A GIRL YOU CAN TRUST...<br>  its just that , the girl that you had found is not worth giving trust with...<br>  there are lots of girls there .. go seek for someone who'll gives you loyalty and their trust too.. :)|`|jROpVbrhaa	Well iam different....TRUST ME. hahahaha....iam here for you. lol|`|bfd7416d5c182b4368126038daa8026faa	maybe ur looking into the wrong gurl let them come to u|`|9aTgP4wVaa	No homo...but...u proballly need to either 1. trust urself....maybe u cheated...and think the world is full of cheaters....(not true...but cheating has that effect on you...)<br>  <br>  Or 2...get over the fact that she did u wrong...people only think wrong of something after they r given reason to...I thought the world of my gf...til she screwed up...u can either deal with it...(like me....harder tho) or fetal position ur love life...its a big world...and the r girls who r trust worthy...|`|cx3JwCgraa	You know how women complain about a typical guy? It's a two way street.<br>  <br>  You're not a "typical guy" (hypothetically, I don't know you) in the sense that girls complain about, so you have to assume that's a two way street too.|`|6AzWUY8Gaa	Because you have already programmed it in your mind that it is hard. Therefore any girl that you meet you would find reason not to trust them because of what you believe. Be yourself and let girls be themselves, you will be suprized!|`|ywe02Qi0aa	cuz they all lie and are mean|`|2WwjS29Maa	ouch! we're not all bad...ur just looking in all the wrong places. don't look, and she'll come to you
PbPiF2p3aa	I thought it was easier because the person acted more mature and we were more interested in friendship and companionship then a passionate love affair.|`|08y217Rdaa	It's still all about passion after 25. Just more stable and not that superficial. Teens run around and seek emotional and physical gratification, their self-esteem depends on that. Later it becomes more future-oriented and feelings become clearer.
6iR7Mvc5aa	Oh my dear you just have to go for the one you love! don't even try to waste your time bitting about the bush you might end up losing the one you love forever!|`|f38daa37b1a29a4f31ff1dc5d2746334aa	you are funny
62cQv3z3aa	you have trust issues <br>  change schools
kMvFqBobaa	Tell your teachers or parents on her. This is really mean and bullying. <br>  <br>  Watch the movie "Mean Girls". It souds like your "friends" are just like these girls. Don't worry, people aren't like that when they get older. <br>  <br>  In the future, stop talking on the phone with these people! They are really mean and obviously have no lives. Try hanging out with different people at school.|`|FiZ1Gqivaa	okay yea they are!! ppl are gonna act like this no matter what age. its pretty sad how some "adults" can still be so immature at this age.<br>  dont even worry about them. obviously these werent good friends. if there seriously gonna do that and show ppl, then why bother caring about them. <br>  karma is a ******! they'll get theres. maybe tomorrow or 5 or 10 years from now. but they'll get whats coming to them. <br>  **** like that is gonna happen anywhere and everywhere whether it be school or work.etc<br>  you just cant let it get to you. in the end its not even worth worrying about.<br>  like my mom always told me, what doesnt kill you, only makes you stronger.<br>  ignore it, smile. show it doesnt hurt or bug you and that will make them pist and eventually give up.<br>  if they see you happy their gonna think "hmm.. what were doing isnt working..."<br>  eventually they'll give up and bully somebody else like the dumbasses they are.<br>  hopefully this helps.<br>  remember smile!! its the best revenge. =]|`|JhWD9NJ4aa	:O what bitches they are!<br>  if they show people the recording and confront you about it just say, yeh so what?, if you act like it doesnt bother you than their just gunna get bored of it and it wont seem as big a deal to people.<br>  keep your head up, dont show them that its bothering you.<br>  dont go down to their level.<br>  they seem like really pathetic bitches.<br>  if i wa you id just forget about them, move on, make new friends.<br>  you seem like a nice person, thats probably the main reason why they are singling you out from the other girls, because they think it will bother you and that you wont say anything.<br>  heres my email address if you ever need to talk-- dw im not some weirdo, im 14, and have alot of experience when it comes to bitches like that.<br>  meggi_94_@hotmail.co.uk<br>  hope i helped, good luck :)
ZmikGFTEaa	you need to win their confidence and that can be done only eventually as you prove to them how serious you are about this job of yours..<br>  Obviously they are concerned about you and yeah they wont agree to this that easily but you really need to make a decision and then convince them that you really want to do this..<br>  Hope everything works out fine..<br>  Good luck!|`|gj6rpPjYaa	Your parents are there to protect and stop you from ungodly activities. Only ungodly people operate at ungodly hours. Are you an ungodly person?

I was soooo put off when after I was in a HUGE wedding for a close friend, I received cheap stud earrings -- and I never wore earrings, nor had my ears pierced since I was a kid (closed up).  I was really annoyed by the gift.  So just be careful of that.<br>  A pretty necklace is a best bet, or a bracelet.  Rings might not fit everyone.<br>  What about pearl bracelets?  Check out Honora pearls.  They come in pretty colors, too.<br>  Also, the jewelry could be something they can all wear with their gowns.<br>  <a href="http://www.qvc.com/qic/qvcapp.aspx/app.nav/params.class.2602.level.3/walk.yah.1001-2168?venue=cgen" rel="nofollow">http://www.qvc.com/qic/qvcapp.aspx/app.n...</a>|`|B6cOlFU9aa	simple tiffany's necklaces with their first initial or just the tiffany's heart|`|QJslTCUBaa	"Things Remembered" go to the web site.

OgImx7G0aa	You need to watch that movie, he's just not that into you. This guy does not like you, i mean where is he going that he cant even call u? If a guy likes u you will knw, we dnt usually play hard to get. Move on, from the little u've typed i think ur a beautiful person.
lSq1LJUtaa	If you feel there is nothing wrong with it, why doesn't he already know.  Maybe you like the attention.  How would you feel if he was receiving similar emails from females?  I am sure you wouldn't want him hanging out with them.|`|2xpzhN5faa	No i don't think its weird at all.<br>  And i doubt your boyfriend would, if he isnt the freaky jealous type. <br>  A lot of my guy friends say stuff like that but i know they only mean it as friendly joke around and im sure its the same for you :)|`|MDtBuOaMaa	they are actually trying to break you and your boyfriend up so that they can ask you out. you must have done something right to get all those guys, but if you love your boyfriend, i would push them away, cuz thats not how friends are supposed to act|`|ZYONnSk9aa	of course hes mad! at you (for playing along) and for the other guys trying to steel his girl!|`|Aj8Gqtkyaa	Behave yourself and quit being a tease.|`|K7vCWru6aa	Yeah he'd be mad, but not at you. I mean think about it, there are like 5 guys trying to get with HIS girl ;D|`|heMWDrLnaa	of course he would be mad ! afterall, you are HIS girl.|`|j4zR5G99aa	wow....one of my friends has EXACTLY the SAME situation...we were just talking about it today...well, look just make it clear to these guys your committed. and i would also tell your boyfriend...he will get mad if he hears it from someone else. besides, if he trusts you, he will be glad you told him the truth.|`|IFUWuMLEaa	hey all guys are not mad....that they fall for the same girl.....you also must be showing interest in them..then only they will approach you..first you try and behave properly and tell them you have a boyfrend in first meeting...then see no one will give you a damn..<br>  As they say"Truth is always bitter" baby.<br>  And you said you are 15.....first you concentrate on studies and then have a boyfrend.....baby....|`|Px990WYDaa	uhh. he probably would get mad, depending on how he is. he might think if you and your guys friends hang out that they will try to do something to you, whether you want to or not.. thats what my bf usually says to me. idk tho|`|L1QDGBK4aa	It depends on what your boyfriend is like. I know mine would just want me to be careful about sending them wrong signals, but he would trust me.
ZmikGFTEaa	This probably means she is not at all concentrating..<br>  no matter how hard she studies she will eventually end up failing as she has to first start liking what she does[ studying ] <br>  go for group studies with her, teach ehr something you know and then ask her Q's and try making it fun.. dont make it look like you people are studying just for the sake of studying or just to pass in an exam..<br>  try to enjoy what you do and only then you will be able to help your friend..<br>  Good Luck!|`|QVSw3K8aaa	ok.. if she not hav interest in studies then, i think she can't study more, so its better for her that she doing any job which suits her. may be while doing job she understands the power of study.......|`|cdNy1Wofaa	study together or giv help ur friend by professional teachers.|`|seqEdwwnaa	study with her...ask her ?'s and have her give you the answers...|`|pVaZty4Maa	maybe if both of you studied together maybe that will work out or you two can study with a group of friends
t0PzSCs0aa	i find it awkward regardless of how cute the guy is. <br>  i find it especially creepy when the guy is like 30 years older than me. feelings of panic start to sink in.<br>  but if the guy is my age, i typically humor him with conversation and based on that ill decide whether to oblige his request for my number.<br>  it also depends on whether i'm single or what mood i'm in. i'm typically not a fan of strangers, but do like the flattery of their conversation.|`|nLeJJ5nMaa	the guys who make the conversation a casual one are the ones who you wont find creepy.|`|oK3TUZkvaa	you have mentioned places like , cafeteria, book stores, outside cinemas, supermarkets, bus stations, train stations etc. usally when a guy does that there is no harm in it. but honestly it can be very creepy. because we are most likely not to see them again. also depends the level of conversation he begins with. if i see this person again and again then i can be more on a comfort level with him. <br>  = )|`|OrA8RTnhaa	If a girl likes you, she will probably smile and blush (most commonly)and if she doesn't like you she won't really know what to say. I've been in that situation, and I think that it just depends on the person. I was in a supermarket and a worker there asked me (around my age) if I wanted to hang out, I was in a relationship, so I just said that you know I don't live around here and am in a relationship, I did find him cute though.|`|w6JkIbjhaa	thats not really that weird.i mean if you are sitting there by yourself.you should want to start a conversation.|`|eLjHqHiWaa	Too spontaneous. Give me some break. LOL
VZVGXRyraa	I thought i'd never find a girl like that too but i did. My fiancee is very low key...she just likes to be together at home and have our romantic nights which is perfect for me because i'm like that too.<br>  <br>  Low key girls can be really hard to find, but they're out there. Just keep looking.<br>  <br>  And i don't think you asking to go see her would be a problem at all, just a nice gesture.
441002ba222c31246fd283fc8f2694bfaa	What they said. You have spent a long time with him gone, and you are starting to drift. But that fact that you feel you would never cheat on him or leave him for this other guy shows that you love him. Once he comes back you will only have eyes for him.<br>  <br>  He is probably doing the same thing.<br>  "Damn! thats a hot filipino chick! Too bad! I love my girlfriend... god i miss her..."|`|kZyfbt3aaa	Yep, definitely.<br>  As soon as your guy is back you won't even look twice at the other guy!|`|s5F745gBaa	Yes. You miss your boyfriend and you then feel lonely, so you get attracted to another guy. But when your boyfriend is back, it will be all okay.|`|xXiCghR4aa	Don't worry hun. You just miss your boyfriend like crazy. You just need to realize that he'll be back soon and it's just your hormones talkin!|`|6S8BKhIYaa	your feelin like this because probably look like shrek
HnWEOkRzaa	hmmm....lemme think about this one...DUH!<br>  of course she's interested i would say the exact same thing if i had gotten a text like that DRUNK OR NOT! and since you didn't text back right away she got worried and texted again. THATS EXACTLY HOW I AM IF I LIKE A GUY!...oh yeah sorry about the all caps there|`|D0ShtJJJaa	If she was drunk what do you expect her to say not all people say smart thing when they are drunk your lucky she didn't tell you to get ****** or something btw she probably likes you and was using Drunkenness as an excuse lol<br>  Good luck :(|`|NrYuEuEwaa	hmm, you sounded kind of pathetic but pretty decent for a drunk. make a move on her very small and see if she makes a move back.|`|5VHWy0Ggaa	yeah it seems like you two definately like eachtoher. take her out on another date, and ask her out! she probably said ''you're great'' because she really likes you and feels the same way. even if she was drinking, you said the way you felt, so why wouldn't she...|`|Li1NfDMfaa	is she giving u more coherent responses now? Some ppl have a hard time txtin when theyre drinkin ( i know i do! ) so that might have been all she could muster up. Or maybe she didnt know what to say to such a nice txt.I think she is intrested and if u mean what u said then you will be great! Good luck!|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	what ?? she really likes you. she just didnt spill her heart out but that doesnt mean she's not interested . She is definitely interested.  i would have replied the same thing. i'm just wondering what wrong with her reply...|`|i3pn4jNcaa	yeah she likes you.
Vx9Lvt9Aaa	hahah if he's not letting your hitt that tooo...then theres a BIG problem.........you have to let him knowww.......thats your GRADEEEEE!!!.......<br>  <br>  <br>  if he doesnt end up helping out on the work...just....quietly email ur professor and let them know.......why fail a class over vagina ur not getting|`|IbbQK960aa	You need to find yourself a girlfriend or do the project as much as you can pick up the slack and quit complaning (remember) someday you may need someone to pick up the slack for  you  help your friends out..|`|sY1itvPkaa	Well that sucks. You're just gonna have to do it yourself. As for the presentation do really good at it and have them fail. I would've done what they did over failing a project. Hahahahahaha.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	It's time for new friends.  If they were supposed to help with this project, you can count them out and need to just do it by yourself.  Just make sure they don't get credit.|`|AA10011751	Change partners.<br>  & if that's not possible, then do all the work this time and make sure you tell the teacher you did everything by yourself and next time choose better friends.|`|eLjHqHiWaa	Change two different partners project. Or get all credit for yourself.|`|d9CjzWotaa	They're both doing his new girlfriend?<br>  <br>  Wow... that's a three way but not the cool kind...|`|0Ee8r5KRaa	tell them to get their dicks out of their girlfriends and get to f*cking work.<br>  <br>  sometimes things like that happen to me|`|pFjgBBUZaa	either u need to find a girl too and F*** her or somehow kick them out the group and do the work yourself :)|`|KfKr3hUmaa	can i join em. kidding, but how do u know?|`|d8d70f3ce62baea0a8cb1a01e21e326faa	unless you are group assigned don't worry and do your work! if you are group assigned find enough time when he is off her and delegate the project and let him worry about his part, explain to the teacher you are having difficulties and let it go at that!|`|cj8iM1Olaa	And they didn't invite you? How rude.
9IyIO0Qkaa	sounds like her life is going to be good what a bum|`|AA11162207	U may cheat her.......|`|1b4303a190dcb3b5cda434ecc73dd29baa	You're girlfriend sounds awful, why don't you just get a new girlfriend?
CCLLnSrGaa	who wears a tie now days|`|NqMmvvgVaa	I would say so. First dates need to have a focus on comfort. I think this includes feel comfortable in your clothing, but also feeling comfortable with the chosen activity and venue. It's easier to have a flowing conversation if the both of you feel comfortable in the environment. For example, dinner in a restaurant can be a little full on and may cause anxiety for some people, which makes it harder to feel comfy and chat normally.|`|AA11899313	[ sigh ] ....It depends, doesn't it! ....as to what kind of date it is ..where you are going ....as to is it 'formal' .....what else you are wearing ....and all the rest of the circumstances surrounding it.<br>  <br>  You might easily ask, 'is the wearing of pyjamas too informal for a first date?'  But, of course, if you are 12 or 13 and it is a sleep-over, then no, it wouldn't be now, would it.<br>  <br>  Sash.|`|y9TvRvs6aa	I guess it depends on what you are doing. If you are just going to a movie, yes a tie would be over the top.<br>  <br>  If you are taking her out to dinner at a snooty restaurant.... definitely wear a tie. Just use your head.|`|sg93GVSJaa	yes, she will not feel as comfortable - although I suppose it depends on the type of girl you're dating|`|I3CNklLKaa	Depends what you tie it round.|`|F4kFUxd1aa	it all depends on where the first date will be. if its formal then you will be dressing for the occasion but if it's not, then I don't see the need to wear one. I know that you may consider wearing one because you want to impress her but it may also turn her off  if you are too conservative. Relax and be you. enjoy|`|Jcu24pe3aa	Being a class act never goes out of style!  It is wonderful to go out with a guy who dresses well, and has the attitude and manners to pull it off.|`|jBigEy0Caa	Depends on where you are going.  Dress appropriately for where you are going, but make sure you let her know so she is not uncomfortable being under dressed.|`|OAYaeW22aa	yes wea something you would wear any day but put a good smellin deoderant on tho. lol. and make shur your cloathe are clean|`|drEfr9waaa	Yes I think so.

J74Y5LKxaa	What turns me on about women?  Confidence in their sexuality while still being every bit a lady.   Women like this tend to smile a bit more, walk with authority, and seem comofrtable in their surroundings without looking in the mirror every few seconds.  On that note let me add that I would rather spend the night with 35 year old plus size business woman woman who knows what she wants, knows  how she likes it, and gives as good as she gets -vs- an attractive 25 year old woman who excuses herself to go to the bathroom every 10 minutes to fix her hair and make up.|`|LMIbr1aeaa	Open minded women|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Long deep kisses with lots of tongue.<br>  <br>  PS - Wow, Isha (above) would love me!|`|AA11755944	a sense of humor.|`|Ummdi0Xtaa	I like when my husband is verbally agressive (in a nice sexy way), He would demand a certain act or position and it's so cave-man like. <br>  I like when he would get me flowers for no reason or when he shows a little jealousy. He is always talking about my boobs or butt. It let me know that he likes what he sees and it makes me feel sexy.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	Do you have a man? The smell of "a" man. Just any man? Not your husband? When they are rough? <br>  <br>  What turns me on is my husbands fingers, when he kisses me. His biceps. I am not an overly visual person though so it generally takes some mental stimulation to get going.|`|1TXJDiedaa	Construction workers are so hot, my husband is a carpenter and when I see him after work I can hardly resist him.... I am like should I let dinner burn and jump on his sexy azz or wait until after dinner! hahaaaa|`|jBigEy0Caa	Someone who can look me in the eye and have an intelligent conversation.|`|EJWphb88aa	Intelligence and smartness|`|e06NRifuaa	beautiful women, nice asses nice boobs, honesty and trust are a must. cuddling|`|kK4vYqXPaa	You wouldn't want to know ... they are mean to him!|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Lots of money and a huge penis.|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	My husband, he is great in every way!
sod4Kqxyaa	She is playing hard to get . If you move on she will be all over you. If you pursue she will ignore you. I would move on because you don't need mind games find someone who is going to be with you because they want to not because now they cant have you *from my view of view as a girl myself|`|5JumtCTGaa	i do not know|`|sY1itvPkaa	Hahahahaha I doubt you are M. Shadows. I love Avenged Sevenfold. But yeah as for your situation I think shes just doesn't want to get in to a relationship just yet. I think you should make her more jealous.|`|v8FlpPbGaa	well sometimes there's more to it then the 'playing games' title.maybe she is just unsure of you.maybe she doesn't want to be in a relationship right now.she must like you if she was getting jealous.if you like her ask her whats up and don't throw it away until you find out.then if she really was playing games then you should move on because playing hard to get is stupid.|`|D8QN3nRCaa	Go up to her and tell her that if she really likes you and stop playing the lil game before you stop trying to get at her..<br>  Because life is toooo short to be wasting your time on something that is not trying to get yooh|`|FyvrWG6laa	Courting someone is something you got to work on. It so happened you met someone like her. if you really like her then enjoy what she is doing. Don't take it seriously you have no plans of marrying her yet right? Dating is fun even if it does not turn out to be Miss Right. Just enjoy!|`|M2YXvH5waa	Probably not.|`|tMJITxk7aa	Sometimes... I'm not really sure why, exactly, but it's not always intentional.<br>  I've found myself doing this before, and it's an awful thing to do to a person, and most of the time even I can't figure it out.<br>  Some girls do it for the fun of having someone as a puppet, which is terrible.<br>  <br>  Others - like myself - do it being we're in love with the person, but are afraid of the commitment of a relationship. You love the person, and you can't bear to see them with anyone else, but at the same time you know the chase is more fun than the catch, and, well... honestly, I'm not sure I know myself.<br>  In my case, it comes from fear commitment, and the fear of ruining the preexisting friendship with the person.<br>  <br>  But I honestly think it varies drastically.|`|pFjgBBUZaa	well it's not a culture issue thing is it? because sometimes girls/guys are culturaly tied and they are not allowed to do certain things. And from the description you have given, she certainly likes you except the hanging out part. she could be nervous about hanging with you for some reason, what did you do on your first date!? lol jk|`|NMXejLxPaa	I'm guilty of doing this exact thing! If I treat a guy like this I normally think of them as my hook up guy or else the guy that boost my self esteem because they obviously like me.  I don't do this anymore because its bitchy and horrible and this girl obviously needs a taste of her own medicine.  Why don't you try playing hard to get!!|`|ecgRNdpBaa	A girl can only go so far while playing hard to get. She's pushed it too far if she is playing that game.<br>  <br>  I think that you should either ask her whats up with that or just move on. There are plenty more great girls in the sea.|`|wGKBuipYaa	Its your turn to play hard to get. You have made your feelings none. Let her chase you for awhile, The next time she gets jealous just ask her Straight out what she wants. then at least you no.|`|xOVizPWVaa	if you like her pursue tell her straight up if she runs move on life is to short.|`|yeJ8HT8Oaa	girls like to keep guys liking them. <br>  even if they don't like the guy. <br>  just move on.|`|fh8bQdGkaa	Sorry bro. That definitely is not playing hard to get. It's possible that she likes you, but wants to take things slowly? It's also possible that she just wants to keep you as her "pet" since a lot of girls like to have guys liking them so they feel better about themselves, even if they don't like you back. You may just be misconstruing why she looks over at you, or why she is "jealous" that you're dancing with another girl. Why is she jealous? do you think she is, or did she just flat out tell you, or maybe a friend told you this? Don't read into things. that's the worst thing you can do. Just chill and talk to her, don't be weird about it, just be honest and understanding. If she turns out to just be a weirdo in whatever case, just move on, she's not worth your time if she's trying to manipulate you or whatever she may be trying to do.<br>  Just like Cammy said before me, it varies drastically from person to person, so don't assume, try to figure it out. If it's not worth your time worrying about, then don't worry about it.|`|BhEKN5nEaa	honestly, no. she's just being dumb. i don't know how much you like this girl, but i would never put up with that ****. <br>       Or if you really don't believe me, just ask her. tell her you think shes playing games and you want a straight answer.
aAUeWJ5laa	She's probably confused just like you are. I think that you need to try to pursue it a little bit longer and see what happens. Don't be afraid to give up though. Girls can't hold you back. There's a lot of other fish in the sea.|`|v8FlpPbGaa	so is this the same girl as your other question...?<br>  you've decided now she's shy and its not game playing? you might be right. she is probably scared but maybe she needs someone like you to break down that boundary she's put up. she likes you obviously.she is just scared to take it any further.and if you like her enough you will try and pursue it and help her.|`|441002ba222c31246fd283fc8f2694bfaa	You should straight up tell her to decide. Either she wants to be in a relationship with you, or she needs to stop getting upset when you talk to other girls. Tell her what you said, you don't have time to fool around, and tell her you like her. Make sure she knows that if she doesn't return the feeling, your going to talk to others.|`|sZMDGsxxaa	tell her what you just said....<br>  take her out to coffee or a drink or something..and just talk about it
pQGUPITeaa	It sounds like you might have some competition!|`|ICOmnGIUaa	almost all girls are bi and some lesbians. She is probably bi considering what has happened in the past.|`|4VIjILk1aa	If she is kissing girls then she is lesbian. Girls don't kiss other girls just for fun. Ask her if she is lesbian or bi.|`|1611a17a4b0cd6610c45b73de16234bcaa	why not ask her...i think that;s the only way to find out or ask her friends...<br>  <br>  whats her facebook account name....?? curios to see her pictures...

Accent your dinner with lemon slices on the side or in the centre. Another great idea is to have a professional cut lemons to resemble different flowers and use that as accents as well. I advise you not to use too many lemons, definitely not all fake, since this makes it a very childish theme. If used right, you could make something really romantic, and still really YOU.

8b606127c9be2be58aee79d6bf12e686aa	If you want to offer support to him, then you should go but play the background don’t try and be in the spot light. Let the court see you as the person who supports your man in every decision he’s making. As far as the materialistic things he needs to just let them go they’re not worth fighting for. He needs to concentrate on getting the joint custody of his children and make sure he makes every visit. As far as you being pregnant, keep that between the 2 of you until this is all over with. You never can tell his soon to be ex wife’s lawyer may try to use you being pregnant against him. Besides that because he won’t have the children the majority of the time, he may have to pay some child support, if she finds out you’re pregnant she may try to dig very deep into his pockets.|`|jaOEtAHKaa	Go with him|`|NlYGbqnkaa	The same thing will happen to him if you go or don't. I have been exactly where your at and I didn't bring my girlfriend with me. If I would have it would have irritated my ex. In most cases i'm all for that but, when he is fighting for his kids you want her to be as agreeable as possible. So if you go you run the risk of making it harder on him. I would stay home and stay right by the phone so he can call and vent as soon as it is done.|`|eVK2zZsOaa	Well if his lawyer told you to go then go. He probably needs all the support he can get right now and having you there might make it easier for him to deal with. When you go to court make sure you are dressed in a nice business suit though, don't go to court looking like you just came from a night out and don't go wearing regular everyday attire. Go there and be his support and look like you are mature enough to help him take care of an 8 and 5 year old. His wife is going to be sizing you up so don't do anything that will give her a reason to talk about you to the judge and bring you into the custody battle. Be presentable.....stay out of it but be his support system.|`|onrcmQf8aa	Yes, it's your place to be there.  You are just as much in his life as the wife is.

And don't worry about his "wife" she isn't in his life anymore, you are. <br>  And congratulations on you being pregnant I hope the best for the both of you.|`|5vgnrvcmaa	The fact is that if you are with or married to a divorced man, his ex is your ex also. You learn to face her now because it wouldn't be good for the kids if you and their mom cannot be civil.<br>  <br>  Another thing:  "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."  It's a great idea to get to be "friendly" with the ex. IT may really work out, or she'll supply you with ammunition you may need in the future.<br>  <br>  Go be with your man and don't falter!!!!!|`|OXSOch9Oaa	If the lawyer says you should go, then you should.  However, keep in mind that some judges frown on such things outside of marriage.  Since his divorce isn't final, they might hold it against him.  Especially if they were to find out you are pregnant.  It's best to hold off all sexual activities until the divorce is final.  Most people don't realize that and often find themselves in trouble.
b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	Go to the cinema, rent a dvd and watch it with popcorn and chocolate and lots of nice foods, go for a long drive, go out for meal but drink soft drinks/water with the meal, go bowling......there are lots of things you can do. Drink played a big part in some of my relationships too. My current boyfriend and I drank lots for the first year of our relationship. Then we realised how much of a waste of money and energy it was, and we started to do other fun things together, some of which I've mentioned above. We've never felt healthier or been happier. We still go out drinking occasionally, but not nearly as much as we did, and we have so much more money, tonnes of energy, and we don't miss that sick, hungover, feeling one little bit!!|`|hgaNxhoaaa	My hubby and I don't drink, but we do: <br>  1. cook together (make sure you each have different duties--you'll get in fights if you're both trying to do the same thing!)<br>  2. play board games (online and in real life)<br>  3. go hiking<br>  4. take photos of each other in public<br>  5. give foot rubs (use lotion)<br>  6. read books out loud to each other (this can be fun and even sexy)<br>  7. travel to new places, even if just for one night to a place nearby<br>  8. walk and talk together in a park or around the city (you can talk about the book you've been reading!)<br>  9. watch our favorite shows together--choose one sitcom you really like and make a tradition out of it, like making pizza and watching Friends on Tuesday night<br>  10. have a coffee night--go to a coffee shop and bring your favorite game<br>  11. go to church together and talk about the sermon afterwards<br>  12. people watch--this can be super fun if you try to guess where people are going or what they're thinking<br>  13. turn on the TV to some show we never watch, mute the sound, and make up what the people are saying<br>  14. go to lame movies in the middle of the day when no one's there and make out, etc.<br>  15. host dinner parties and invite a ton of random people<br>  <br>  We do all sorts of things together, and most of them don't cost a ton of money so they're easy. Also, alternate activities that each of you like. For example, maybe you choose what to do on even days and he chooses on odd days. This sounds dumb, but it can prevent hem-hawing about who gets to pick what to do this time. Hope this helps!|`|RsUEC74qaa	Lolz this is funny but we go jogging,and i start racing him lolz,we listen to songs and dance together and go to movies and all..
1Rq2tdcKaa	Trust me, codecs are a huge pain. why not avoid the unpleasantness and just convert the video file? If you have a PC you can try this:<br>  <a href="http://free-mpg-to-avi-converter.mp4kits.com/" rel="nofollow">http://free-mpg-to-avi-converter.mp4kits...</a><br>  <br>  i haven't used that myself but i just yahoo searched it and it was the first result.<br>  <br>  what i do is go into windows movie maker, import the video, then export it. but when you export it, click on the "other video options" check box and pick the DV-AVI option. then export. AVI works best in AE, though WMV format will work, exporting in AVI format will cause a larger file size but the quality will not be lost.
eAIapfXsaa	I think he does like you but he's too shy to make more moves even though you said you like him. That was great that you did that. Keep pursuing him. Spend a lot of time with him at school. Eventually he will get comfortable being around you and he'll loosen up. Then he'll ask you out. Or you could just ask him out right now. I think that would be best.

Yes, he loves you and yes, he cares, but he is a man thus, color challenged.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|wADnvKGFaa	Best advice I can give (getting married on Aug 15 2009) is try to keep others uninvolved it the decision making-IE: parents and friends.  The minute you start asking for opinions, people feel like they have cart blanch with their ideas for your day.<br>  <br>  Of course get opinions for the big things like your dress and stuff.  but leave small things that can cause frustration like the seating chart to you and your fiance.  Otherwise you have to make a whole bunch of people happy instead of just you guys.<br>  <br>  For our wedding we chose the church, reception site, colours, transportation, seating, menu and others without asking for anyone elses opinion.  Things like the dress, tuxes, invitations, favors, we got some help (really just to make people feel more involved.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DchAJvVqaa	start as early as possible, i am getting married on january 29, 2011 and i haven't started planning yet but i am doing a lot of research so that when it comes time planning the details, i'll know exactly what i want and the best and least expensive way to get... good luck  :)|`|mQSk7fB6aa	Take your time - start as early as possible, and try not to do too much at once.  Also, accept any help offered by friends and family.|`|37803e6c4f82e6a134d585be72409c93aa	Start early as possible and get all the big items(reception place,cake, caterer) out the way or you can hire a Wedding Consultant. Good Luck!|`|lgxE5nUoaa	My husband and I got engaged quite early in our relationship and we really took our time planning the wedding.  This helped because by the time the big day arrived, everything came together as we hoped it would.  Do lots of research and try to keep it as simple as possible.|`|GvamTVqAaa	Elope :)
8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	It's true that men love beautiful women and in our society, beauty is youth...<br>  <br>  I don't know about whether this is shallow or whether this is societally influenced by our entertainment and what-not.  I also think it is not just men who value youth as beauty.<br>  <br>  The stupidity is that when a culture becomes as completely absorbed in the physical (as ours has), the value of wisdom goes out the window.  And a society which does not value wisdom is a society headed for failure.<br>  <br>  I know that there are men who appreciate the entire package that is a woman.  I have one.  Does he turn his head at young beauty?  Sure--we all do!  Will he follow after it?  No way--for one thing, he does not want any more children.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	It is true.<br>  <br>  It is also true that deep men want younger.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Shallow men, shallow women, yup - <br>  <br>  always looking for the next best thing...|`|asxqampCaa	Is it true shallow women always want rich men?|`|uFlrbRbXaa	yes, men want to get a piece of that unpounded booty before said booty either gets A) pounded into oblivion or B)  contaminated with craters and stretch marks|`|kK4vYqXPaa	Some men always keep thier lucky from day 1 . Only the good men keep thier diamonds protected!!|`|FzFSzilmaa	want younger what???|`|SsfnitjXaa	I wouldn't say shallow.  Words like "in denial", "can't handle a real woman", "silly" come more to mine.  Men don't want children when they are 21-40.  Then 45 hits and they realize that that is the only thing they will leave behind once they die.  So off they go, seeking a young chick to breed with.  Using her womb to procreate his immortality.  Some men want a "do-over" because they *ucked up the first attempt to be a husband and father.  Why a younger woman would want an man more than 10 years older than herself is beyond me.  Maybe she is just as mental as he is.  In the end she gets her just reward....... an old man that she has to diaper.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Yes that's what I been told also.
cps0mU1Laa	the whole life story thing would be a major turn off when first meeting someone, so that's definitely a bad idea, just ask then if they want to play volleyball, or Frisbee, start chatting, ask her where she's from you know small talk, grab a bight to eat, then ask her if she'd like to hang out the next day. i live in Savannah ga., trust me it always works|`|82bMFhs4aa	be yourself go up to her and start a convo bout wheter shes on vacatoin visitin?..<br>  -good luck|`|Az87btqBaa	Ok, lets look at your life and my life, and both of our ideas for picking up women, and lets compare and see which one of us is choosing the better route:<br>  <br>  YOU: Want to go try hard to talk to american girls on the beach and need pick up lines.<br>  I: Fly to Thailand and walk down the street and have 50 girls running up to me with THEIR pick up lines.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP0gUGXyhNc&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP0gUGXyh...</a><br>  <br>  YOU: Want to take an american girl out on dates and probably spend $20 per date or more.<br>  I: Pick up thai girls and go out with them for less than $5 per date.<br>  <br>  YOU: Want to deal with the attitude that alot of american women have, where they think they are princesses and you are nothing to them. You want to play all the mind games they like to play and most likely have them cheat on you when another Tom Cruise with more money or a tougher act walks by. You want to deal with overpriced girls that arent even that great looking with big ego's from all the guys that tryed hard to flirt with them on the beach and crashed and burned, building up the girls ego's at the same time so they think they are valued at much higher than their actual worth.<br>  I: Deal with sweet humble thai girls that are not loud and arrogant and do not want to fight and argue at every chance they get, they just like to have fun without all the drama. Girls that look like supermodels but dont even know it, so if you're flirting with them on the beach, they wont get the egos and treat you like crap.<br>  <br>  Sooooooo The rational decision would be for you to save up $800 and fly to Thailand.|`|NDqDFnGyaa	Go to a tanning bed :D Girls don't like white guys, hehe ;)<br>  <br>  If she's just out walking.... Just go walk beside her =] That's definitely a cute approach :D<br>  Well the "explain your life from birth forwards" idea might not be a good one for when you first meet her. Ask her things like "are you on vacation here" "where are you from" "where are you staying" stuff like that. Just don't come across as a stalker ;)<br>  Just be yourself. Give her little compliments, but AGAIN, not in the stalker mode. Haha. Don't outwardly ask her out, just see if she wants to go to dinner some time. Toss a football with her :)<br>  Good luck with your romantic endeavors ;-)|`|RQi9qG5iaa	well, first of all i think you should't worry about picking up girls...they will come to you. there are so many sluts in this world. second of all dont try to get all of these ideas from other people just be yourself to the girls and everything should work out. unless you are a total loser creep then you could possibly try complimenting her or some **** like that. sorry if that wasn't good advice to you but i think its good because i love a good compliments.
i2jEwWpZaa	ermmmm... not relli though ur lucky! i have a hugh one on meh cheek!<br>  <br>  (rate best answer)|`|OeRzlZPnaa	Having a hickey on your neck isn't a good or a bad thing. People who are saying a bad thing don't really get it and people who say it's a good thing don't either. Hickeys can kind of just happen when you don't mean them, a guy I was with accidentally gave me a hickey when he nibbled too long. While some people might see it as trashy or slutty, I think they're just closed minded. Not to say that you should be purposefully going out and getting hickeys on your neck either. Preferably though I'd hide it just to avoid the comments.|`|hBhhLRe5aa	i don't think is a good thing... it all just depends on what kinda person you are.. if you have self respect for yourself you would not want to be seen with markls onn your body.. and if you do want to get them you should get them were you cant see them,|`|AA10928214	They are gross, and you look like trailer trash, I always want to slap my brother when he comes home with one. Disgusting. All the other person is doing is marking their territory.|`|TJ2EfH7oaa	it's trashy, and just about as classy as a dog going up to a fire hydrant and marking his territory by whizzing on it....|`|80V7RxwQaa	it's not good to let it be seen.<br>  but i mean if u want a hickey then go ahead.|`|iU1yT9LXaa	nahhhhhhhh|`|twVyisGnaa	Not if you want to avoid people getting in your business.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|eS9nPWqBaa	I didn't know that ppl were still giving Hickeys lol and why would it be a good or bad thing?|`|swV3SIw7aa	not really hickeys are actually not a good thing to have at all<br>  i dont remember the name of what they actually are<br>  but basically getting a hickey<br>  is like sucking your blood to the upper layers of your skin cells damaging them<br>  <br>  -nods-<br>  i remember health<br>  lol|`|B7WIZdglaa	disgusting. way to let the world know that you are basically a w.hore.<br>  <br>  <br>  not saying YOU are one, but in general.|`|9gRikg8Kaa	its trashy.. but ive had a good count of hickeys on my neck in the past..|`|zx0IQ1Fsaa	its is a sign of trust and love <br>  its not really safe because you are actually breaking a vein
5IO1JEY1aa	Absolutely.......when I was married, I had the same thought.  I wanted to be able to go out and not worry about having to come home.  I wanted to be able to do whatever I wanted to do and not have anyone to answer too.<br>  <br>  Now, I'm divorced and wish I had my pumpkin back.  I miss her so much....but, understand she's not coming back.|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	I think that a lot of people feel that way. It seems retarded but a lot of people fantasize about being single again for one night. I mean the way to deal with it is to remember that marriage is much deeper and some people feel trapped because deep down they want that again, and some just feel they moved to quickly into their marriage. I think more people think this way when most of their friends are single. I think dealing with it is stop thinking about it because you are right it is not cheating but a thought can turn to cheating if ever acted on. It seems to me you are in love and just thinking of the what if. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|kFcdwVwdaa	my wife was like that. she made me feel like a slave like i couldn't do anything. friends would invite us to go and she didn't want to. she said that she wanted "US" time. when we did we sat around and did nothing. it got boring, sometimes you need to have a girl's night out or a guy's night out. but both of you have to agree. Oh and there has to be rules that both of you agree with. its a matter of trust. i am now divorced because she still wanted me to be her slave. im not into that. but you don't have to be "single" to feel it. just have fun and be careful.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	No, not at all. These past couple of weeks we have been dealing with the lost of our child and me having to get surgery twice in less than 10 days and I have come o realize how much I love and appreciate it him. I wouldn't change a thing.|`|CQsD09D6aa	I understand. Why don't you plan a trip to Vegas or France or where ever with just the girls and live it up? You don't have to cheat on your husband but you could forget about him and act single.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	It has happened to me - not often though.  Who doesn't dream of ditching their real life and living a fantasy from time-to-time?  That's human!  Just don't go ruining your life by acting on it...|`|jBigEy0Caa	I'd have to say no.  I have way too much to loose and it's just not worth it.|`|FzFSzilmaa	one night??? no... could do with a few months... :D|`|V1GKJh8zaa	There is NOTHING wrong with 'girls night out'. It is healthy to socialize with your friends and even healthy to flirt. <br>  <br>  Sounds like you've not done your research and if you're truly worried about appropriate behavior in your marriage... take beloved hubby with and go see a marriage counselor who can 'spell things out' for you.<br>  <br>  Ultimately - it is between you and your hubby and what you guys agree on.<br>  <br>  Best of luck - keep communication open.|`|hYZIYla0aa	EW all feel like that at one point or another.It happens to us when things get a little boring,or things seem to be in such a way that you feel like the romance is gone,This shall pass,is it worth ruining your marriage,over one night of flirting?Flirting leads to other things,then it goes to far.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Go out with a few gal friends, and have some innocent fun. Be ok wtih him going out with a few guys. My mom had her card club that went out for movies, played cards, out to eat, dad has his surfing mornings and out to shoot pool nights with the guys.It is ok to miss the single life, this way you can both have time off, and not have issues in hte marraige about it.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Trapped no. To run around single one more night... Oh what I'd give.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I'm not married, I'm divorced.  I've been a single mom for 10 years and I occasionally fantasize about disappearing from my responsibilities.  Life is work--we all do it...  It has nothing to do with love or being "trapped."  I adore my child and would want to die if something happened to him...<br>  <br>  But life is work.  Enjoy the good times and feel the love, because time goes too fast.<br>  <br>  Turn to him with this and talk about what you need to feel great with him.  It isn't someone else, btw.  You might want to word it differently...|`|7sEFufRbaa	No, never trapped and I couldn't imagine being away from him for even one day.  Try new things and spice stuff up.    Our sex is never boring and we bring new stuff into it all the time.     Just seems like you are in a rut.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I feel sorry for your husband, because to you, he is little more than a pair of handcuffs.

iMY2fgYdaa	You need to comminicate with her about this issue, try to get down to the heart of the matter....why is she tithing soooo much? Does the church push for everyone to give and give and give ? Why does she feel that she has to over give her financial ability? If she doesn't really know or just feels she should to be a good christian then you need to seek some counsling. Maybe you should approach your pastor privatly and see how he feels about tithing and when too much is just tooo much.  I am a Christ follower and personally I don't beleive that tithing is for everyone...but most importantly God doesn't want you give because the church says so...only out of your heart if you feel he is calling you to it. So|`|hjc2y3TMaa	Maybe you can bring it up within the church. It is affecting her life negatively, sounds like she may have a problem (equal to that of a shopaholic) and maybe if others help her realize she is only harming her own financial health then she can make steps to keep it at 10%.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Print out a picture of the Geico money and post it some place where she will see it. Then when she asks "What's this?" you can explain "That's the money you could be saving by not tithing." Then play that "somebody's watching me" song.|`|8130732466e5c537088eddfef54bd90faa	Actually tithing is only 10%.  Any amount after that is considered a "Love Offering". Why do you think she is giving too much?  Is she unable to pay bills or something?|`|bO2rzfISaa	Well, it should be 10%, and if she thinks that's the right thing to do good luck convincing her of anything else.  You two are poorly matched if she has wacko religious beliefs and you don't.|`|DMhAPurkaa	Dear Catch a Beatin<br>  I noticed you said girlfriend <br>  perhaps another girl would be a better match for you<br>  It would be better if you were happy<br>  You dont seem happy with this situation

NO Way!!!|`|SiniSj1eaa	Just to clarify for everyone here...<br>  <br>  Im a 23 year old female who DOES NOT watch American Idol, does NOT speed, does not pass out from drinking, and Im a college graduate and help run a state agency...so not EVERY young female is lacking in the mature dept.

Look at some dating sites.  Men that are 50 or older are saying their looking for a woman between the age of 30 and 49.  They very rarely say they are looking for a woman their age.  it tells you a lot about their character and maturity level.  If they are truly into a relationoship for the relationship and not just for the sexuality part of it then they will want a woman who is kind and generous and emotionally stable.  Very hard to find a man with that kind of character.|`|fc964df50bc3ae84b97937ecb982821baa	I think men that age feel that women that age carry a lot of baggage and they like the carefree attitudes of the younger girls. Sometimes single, 30-something women can be a little jaded about life and men in particular because they haven't found one yet. Some guys just want a girl who has a nice tight young body though...|`|JbA7a5kGaa	When a guy hits 35.  By that time he should be a little stable financially.<br>  <br>  If he wants to have fun (a lot of sex, and little nagging)  He will have to seek out a younger woman.<br>  <br>  Woman over 28 seem to be full of baggage.  Then dated too many bad boys.  They have 1-3 kids.  They are starting to realize their expiration date on hotness is coming up.  So they start to become a headache.<br>  <br>  Young girls don't care about anything other than money, and male attention.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	I was 37 when I first married, my wife was 35.  I had no desire to marry anyone extremely younger than myself because there really isn't a lot in common.  The only reason to go out with a younger woman is simply to tap it..not marriage or having a real meaningful relationship (an ego / status thing).|`|hjc2y3TMaa	They don't. Bring on the cougars!<br>  An older woman is more experienced, knows what she wants, doesn't beat around the bush. <br>  While it's true younger women are too immature. Still trying to figure out why the sky is blue, which way is up/down etc... What can you do with them? Watch American Idol and watch her Myspace her friends about it?<br>  These are my husbands words, he also says-- young women are dummies. He already got to hang out with that when he himself was young.<br>  <br>  I think any man interested in younger women is immature & insecure himself.|`|bIimm8fSaa	No.  Men know older women are experienced women and a lot more mature.  We know how to please.  Younger women are used.  Helps their ego since they are aging.  Sorry, they are using you.|`|ntcETBTQaa	older men want younger goods... <br>  <br>  Its only natural.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	yes, but getting one, that is the problem|`|CF1R0TPvaa	Women are like automobiles.  If you're lucky enough to have a porsche then you love it forever because it continues to perform and holds it value, and has high quality leather seats that last forever.<br>  <br>  If you can't afford a porsche, then a camero is good if it's newer.  <br>  If you can't afford a camero and you need to get a corolla, then you want a new one, because nobody wants to drive an old corolla.<br>  <br>  Therefore, if you're a Corolla, you'd probably better hook a man early on.  If you're a porsche you can get owned by a rich man, then when he's bored of you there is another almost as rich man waiting to pick you up on the secondhand market and you'll get loved all over again.|`|xgumaBURaa	It has nothing to do with status, or younger women making us feel "younger." It's purely biological. Evolution has taught us that women at that age are super-fertile. This is why a middle-aged couple will endure months and months of costly and cumbersome fertility treatments in hopes of conceiving, while a fifteen-year-old girl who once dry humped her boyfriend through a snowsuit can crap a kid into a porta-potty at Homecoming without ever even realizing she was pregnant. Girls that age are baby-making machines.<br>  <br>  Even if the men aren't looking to have babies, that is what we are programmed to want to do.<br>  <br>  I wrote a whole article about this. You can read it at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://foulpapers.blogspot.com/2009/02/33.html" rel="nofollow">http://foulpapers.blogspot.com/2009/02/3...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8oG3Jsk4aa	YES. this may be the fact, I am 34 and I do prefer younger girls ... but not teenagers.|`|dItZAwI2aa	i'll answer this and expect many thumbs downs but can provide proof of what i say...<br>  <br>  i'm 47. i perfer younger women because all of those around my age have posted profiles that say in part or in whole:<br>  <br>  i've been pent up for too long in my marriage, i want to experience females, threesomes, foursomes, every fantasy i have ever had. my children are all grown and i want to experience what they did after high school dances and at parties. i want to try drugs, drink alcohol and wake up naked every morning with many naked men and women lying beside me and feeling oh so sexually fulfilled.<br>  <br>  that was an actual ad i read and too many more are just like it. this was from a 44yr old woman.<br>  <br>  younger women don't have so much pent up anger and frustration that their life hasn't gone the way they wanted it to. men and women still want one on one relationships...manogomy isn't dead despite what anyone thinks...so which would u perfer...a one on one relationship with a younger woman or a free for all almost orgy-like setting with an older one...seems like a no-brainer to me.<br>  <br>  thats why i perfer younger women.<br>  <br>  good luck and GOD bless.<br>  <br>  bring on the thumbs down but think about what you older women would want if u suddenly found yourself single...kinda changes the whole profile of things, doesn't it.|`|6mVpfmR6aa	Sometimes we prefer to look at younger women.  Sometimes we prefer to talk to younger women.  However, when it comes to relationships, we prefer people with something in common with us.   <br>  <br>  You might want to consider what you have in common with these older guys.
5VHWy0Ggaa	he does seem jealous/possessive...<br>  <br>  my boyfriend doesn't really care who i hang out with, boy wise. he trusts me, and said that he doesn't really care if i hang out with boys unless he feels threatened. like if he knows that boy likes me, or knows that we've had something in the past... then he's more worried about it... but never says anything about it or gets mad at me<br>  <br>  just as long as he allows you to be friends with guys, then i would say it's okay. but it's not okay for him to control your social life. if you have a guy friend, and you just want to hang out, then you should be able to. <br>  <br>  he probably is just doing it because he doesn't want to lose you and loves you so much but feels a little insecure. just constanly remind him that you love him, and that you would never cheat on him.|`|58i4acBGaa	yea numbers 1 and 3 sound hella possesive,but 2 (unless your whore and love sleeping with other people) isnt|`|G1nPkwivaa	When in doubt there is no doubt|`|5abb6cf20f6d1b8b8ef23d153a85ab34aa	It sounds as though either he is insecure, or you are acting (possibly quite unintentionally) in ways that cause him to react in an insecure way. <br>  <br>  Good relationships are built when both parties feel secure, loved, and trusted, too. If he can't or won't trust you, that's a big red flag. <br>  <br>  I would have a heart-to-heart with him. You are an individual, not a piece of property to be controlled, and by the same token, he needs to be able to trust you. I would be honest. I would try to find out the reason behind the action. <br>  <br>  Some women like their guys to be possessive (some guys want their girls to be that way, too). Still, it can end up badly. It isn't a game to keep going if you plan to make it a long-term relationship. Trust me, it's a pain in the rear when every step you take out the door your spouse wants to know who/what/where/when/why you're going and/or thinks you need to ask him permission, etc. <br>  <br>  I've seen relationships like that before. It usually doesn't end well.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	The second comment struck me as very creepy that never with anyone else part, sounds like he looks at you as property that cannot be touched. The calling and making sure he knows what you are doing all the time sounds familiar to me. My current BF acts this way and he used to be really bad about it. If I went out of town to go to an appointment he wanted me to text him when I got there, text him when I left, text him when I got into town. At first I thought oh how loving he wants to make sure I am okay but after a while it just got plain annoying and a huge hassle. It's more of an obsessive thing and he has calmed down quite a bit because I told him he was too bossy and controlling. I can kind of understand how maybe he would get upset if you are talking to other guys but if they are just your friends and he starts accusing you of doing it on purpose that is a little too much. Just keep an eye on some things and if it strikes you as creepy or over the line, then I would say something to him about it.|`|2h4eetekaa	yeah sounds possessive definitely the jealous type|`|kA1mYSOtaa	Sadly, it is normal; however, that doesn't make it right. It sounds like this guy has some issues with many things - namely trust. I think he lacks self-confidence and the insecurity and controlling nature of his inquests are his natural defense mechanisms that he uses to mask his fear of being insignificant to you. Does he love you? Probably, but he either does not respect you and/or does not feel that you respect him. What needs to happen is not anything that you can do. He must re-evaluate himself as an individual and gain his own self-respect. Once he does that (if he is successful in doing so), this problem will be  a non-issue. But I don't want to give you false hope here...most of us guys are not capable of doing this on our own. He may need some sort of counseling.|`|K6Q2YdYSaa	hai,<br>  <br>  most of the guys are like this only. ur guy is loving you extremely and he doesn't want to lose u and also he will think tat u have many friends sometimes there is chance of changing the mind (dont mind) becoz girls mind is sometime gets fickle  mind. so dont worry becoz its a normal behaviour of all boys, it shows he is very possesive. and for some time u reduce talking with ur other friends (boys) start caring to ur boy so obviously he will come to your root. as soon as possible like if he is settled in his life. marry him .... becoz when love grows it will become day by day he will become more possessive tats why.<br>  <br>  good luck.<br>  <br>  bye|`|6UjzFXsyaa	he cares and loves you so much that he does not want to lose you. He thinks you might leave him s he's being a little possessive.

There is no easy way.<br>  <br>  A better question is if you want to flirt with that person.  If you do, go for it.  If you don't, make sure he/she knows you value them as a friend.<br>  <br>  Flirting can be respectful and fun.  It doesn't mean that someone wants a relationship, but it can open that door.  However, if it doesn't feel fun, even if you like the person, stop.|`|l2eztZh5aa	flirting is usually when someone compliments you and always blushes.<br>  being friendly is smiling.<br>  <br>  mine? please??<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgIF6dKbvccB5zJ0L2YZXKrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222223213AAc7SEe">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
S5x6KNHraa	well u could do worst things than marry try to wait until you are 21 if u can or get your own home together to see how things work good luck|`|1hciyvKdaa	The adult way to handle this is, that you should both be working, you should be living on your own, and can totally support her. There should be time to both get to at least 21 before considering marriage. You didnt say why your in two dif states, did you meet online or one family moved out of state?<br>  If this was an online relationship, let it go. Be real here ok. She has everything to lose, you have nothing to lose if it doesnt work out.  In the scheme of life, having each of your parents ok maybe not thrilleld but ok with getting married, is much better than them seeing it as you stealing her away from their lives, and thats how they will see it. <br>  Life is long, there is absolutely not one benefit by running off and getting married. She from your other questions, is already showing signs shed like to slow it down anyhow. A man that can prove with actions and not words, that he has the means to support his love is way more respected, and the relationship supported by family than someone not ready, whose just lonely in bed.  So take a step back, make an adult plan, a life plan, let her parents see how shes working, and your working on a common goal, to someday get married when your ready. Running off is never solution for any problem in life. Other issues like jobs, we dont run from them, we work through getting things better at work, or seek to upgrade our status in life by getting a better job, we dont walk away and then have nothing. Its about making wise descisions. I think you know what I mean, and I think you really can make this a better situation. It would feel much better saying mom and dad, were coming to CA to see you this Christmas!! Than sitting home and her being sad her parents dont speak to her anymore. Ok, take it slow, make it a good life plan, and both work to obtain the goal.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Parents are usually right since they hae been there and done that. I would listen to them, but on the other hand it is your life to do as you wish. you both are of age to do what you wish so if marring and leav ing is what you want then go for it. Just don't let her loose her family over it.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	How is this any different than if her parents did approve?  If they approved, would your plan be to live with them?  Seems to me like the only reasonable course of action is that you're going to live in AZ when you get married whether they approve or not.  My advice, therefore, is to put their disapproval into perspective: you are adults, and so what anyone's parents think is totally irrelevant.|`|V2c0dAtwaa	TECHNICALLY speaking, you don't need your parents' approval to get married....<br>  <br>  But wouldn't it be much nicer if things were no rough humps in the relationship?.. well.. it depends on you guys.<br>  <br>  20 is a bit too young I agree but do whatever you think is best. No one's stopping you.... except your PARENTS!!! dum dum dum O_o|`|AA10886262	you should be listening to your parents at this point in your life; if it's meant to be that the two of you will be together there is no reason why you can't wait; the two of you need to sit down and talk with all the parents.....|`|TEX1iYQgaa	Where do you guys plan to live, in California or Arizona?<br>  <br>  Find a counselor in the city and state where you plan to live. I think it would be a good idea to discuss your situation with an objective person. Premarital counseling would be really beneficial for you guys. It will help you to identify some of the obstacles in your relationship, and it will help you guys to get your expectations of marriage on the same page. You can also get some sound advice regarding each of your parents.<br>  <br>  Where in Arizona do you live?|`|AA12159712	Being 20, you don't really need anyone's approval to get married. If it's a matter of being disowned or left out of their will because of it, there may be some hesitation on one's part, but nothing to prevent a marriage legally.  Usually parents who are very protective don't want to give up children at any age. The "empty nest" syndrome may be kicking in, not wanting to be left with no children in the home, no matter the age.  Disregard them and go do your thing, if you are capable of supporting a marriage financially once outside the home.|`|hYZIYla0aa	If you are worried about the parents then maybe you two can get counseling,this would not only help you but it would show both of your parents that you are really trying to do what is right.In the end it is not their decision to make it is yours. I have a step child in Kansas has cheated on his girlfriend,but she also tells lies,I would not want them to get married,unless they get counseling,but it is not my decision.I just hope they do the best thing for both of them.|`|CQsD09D6aa	You are both adults and have a right to do as you please. However, you are both still young. Consider waiting a little to tie the knot not because it is what your parents want but because it would give you a chance to mature a little more. Marriage is tougher than it seems.|`|pvZZ9Jzmaa	you are 20, you can do whatever you want....but beware of the concequences........|`|V1GKJh8zaa	Sounds like 'the moment' is more important than good advice.<br>  <br>  I'm noticing a trend that those between 17 and 22... all seem to think 'this is all there is to a lifetime'. Don't kid yourself! If you two are 'meant to be' give yourself some time to grow up.<br>  <br>  No one has all the answers and 'specially those without life experience. You can always go to school and focus on bettering your ability to function as grown adults who have to pay bills, mortgages and etc. Love does NOT conquer all, except idiots. Love does NOT sustain you through everything.<br>  <br>  Give yourselves the opportunity to grow into who you are, which will hopefully ever be evolving. Commit to bettering yourselves without deciding that the parents don't know what they are talking about.<br>  <br>  Also... the parents, they are talking from their perspectives and experiences. It doesn't mean they are right, nor wrong. Just means they want what they see is best for you. Marriage, remember, is more than paper. Its your heart, life and experiences blended even as you grow and experience life through different eyes.<br>  <br>  Don't MAKE it work because your biological chemicals are still meshed and entangled. Stand back without emotion and look at the situation. Get outside counseling - from adults you do respect. Go seperatley and together.<br>  <br>  A great book - "Lies at the Alter". Will show you where you're lacking and where you are strong. Easy read and worth the time if you're contemplating marriage, at any age.|`|mbYdd4UUaa	Both of you..only 20 years of age. You want to get married to be together. Can you support her and your future family financially. Do you even have a job? Are you done with school that will provide good income Think for the future.It's not easy. Right now, the only thing that matters is you want to be together, but if you really care for each other, that can wait, finish school, get a good paying job. grow up mature a little bit more then you should be ready to have a family. You both will be happy as well as your parents. They only want the best for you guys. 2 -3 years from now both of you might realize that  you don't really  love each other especially if being together means hardships. Think many many times, if this is true love, it can wait. Please don't get married without your parents' blessings...
MNyYWoFfaa	Karma is a bunch of crap.  There are simply consequences to actions.|`|AA11336133	You're thinking of Karma in the Western sense. Regardless, Karma doesn't work that way. Even if something were to occur relatively quickly in their lives, it's not a tit for tat. Let's say they hit you, well that doesn't mean someone will run up and hit them too. Karma could manifest in many different ways. It can take days, or years to manifest or lifetimes(if you believe in reincarnation.) Basically, what I'm trying to say is there will likely never be a situation where you can determine that Karma is affecting someone for what they did to you.<br>  <br>  If you look at Karma with the original meaning, it's the totality of someone's actions in previous lives and their current life that will determine how their future existence is.
cllt4Alraa	it means he wants to do the work of even the simplest tasks for you so you dont have to. that he wants to take care of you even if you can.
djUMvICoaa	Which can you live without, the dog or the money?  The truth is the dog, no matter how much he adds to the family, is already a drain on the checkbook, vet bills, food etc. and always presents a liability especially if he has bit once already.  It sounds to me like he might be the one to go.  There are a lot of families like yours who have given up on pets because they can no longer afford them.  If you look at the big picture, it all might get worse before it gets better and would that mean you might have to get rid of him anyway?  Then you might have missed out on any extra income you could have had now.|`|UxlL89rHaa	Train your dog to be on his own in a room, or give him to family or friends to look after for a wile.|`|mldo1vxYaa	Its pretty simple really, whats more important, your family or a dog??? If the dog has already bit its a wonder he hasnt been put down, regardless of whether he was provoked or not. And no I would not leave my child where there is an animal, especially if I knew he had bit someone before.<br>  <br>  Get family members to have the dog during the day or just give him to another family that can take care of him.|`|f46d7715219180bc009af5394dfa63e8aa	ok maybe should find something else to do to help out ,locking the dog up all day is not a good idea if he is not use to that,getting rid of the dog when he is a family member is bad or babysit for only a few hous a day before and after school but remember the kids are our of school so much ,if you are gGamingo have an written agreement with parents put a statement in that contract that you will not keep any child for more than 3 hours a day that way if you have to put the dog out side of in a room ,he won't be confined to that room all day.good luck
1rmSuG2Haa	Probably that you are either 1) talented and cute, or 2) that you're VERY egotistical and think yourself better than others.<br>  <br>  Most likely, it is 1.. she thinks you're cute and is teasing you a bit. <br>  <br>  If she smiled or was playful when she said it, she thinks 1. If she was serious or stern, she thinks the second one.<br>  <br>  Good luck! =)|`|aAUeWJ5laa	She meant that you have a quality that Hollywood looks for. Looks, personality, acting, singing... something like that!
iwjxi562aa	Well yes and no.  I think you need to tell him how you feel.  Let him have a chance to handle things.  If he does not man up and say something to her about making you uncomfortable he is not worth your time.|`|wRuBe9odaa	Well, it depends. You definately should talk to this guy about his mother before you break up with him. Maybe you can still go out with him but just stay around from his house and mother. You probably need to atleast get him to talk to his mother about her problems, so even if you still break up with him, maybe his mom wont cause so many problems in the future. I really dont think that your reason is good enough, especially if you really liike him. Maybe your just using this as an excuse to break up with him cuz you dont like him as much as you used to.|`|e488c78b0404e0d573309d30166d7451aa	Depends... if the man is supporting his mother and thinks that she is right and if you discuss because of her fault all the time then he is a little mommy′s boy and you will always be second choice and not really good enough. <br>  If on the other side he stands up for you and tells his mother that it is enough and that there is no chance for her to mess up your relationship, then simply ignore this lady.<br>  I would not stay with a guy who does not defend me in front of his mother or a guy who is acting like a little boy in front of his mother. No thank you... I would not suffer because of the fault of a mother in-law.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Yes.  Yes it is.  Parents can be stupid - kids shouldn't be punished for that.  If your BF is willing to stand up to his mother and man-up to your relationship than yes, it would be wrong to break up with someone that is trying...|`|fc1n9vBjaa	It's fine if it's just a relationship, but if you're married then find a way through it cause marriage is for life and isn't disposable.|`|j4PwaY5Jaa	no and yes no cuz you can only take so much and yes cuz ur not with his mother your with him|`|PccHbsKbaa	yepp its you and the boys relationship not you and the mother|`|zjuMrDmGaa	No, but DO tell him exactly WHY you're splitting...it may help him in the future.|`|hgaNxhoaaa	No, it's not wrong. His family is a part of him, and if you don't like the family, it's going to reflect in your relationship with him. You may like/love the guy, but you can't get rid of his family!|`|4gZYucHMaa	It's not wrong if the guy isn't backing you up against her.<br>  <br>  If he is with you, and backing you up then I'd ignore her. You don't have to be anything but as polite to her as you would a stranger but not going overboard.|`|kprKXEOSaa	You have to decide what you want your future life to be.  There's no getting rid of her.  You can only decide if you want to get rid of him.  If she hates you now, it will only get worse after you give birth to her grandchild.  If you choose him, you also choose her, they're a package deal.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	If his mother interferes or her mind games affect your relationship and he won't do anything about it - then no.  It's a perfectly good reason to break it off.  A man is meant to put his partner before his mother and if he won't do that he'll never really put you first in anything.  A mummy's boy does not make a good partner.|`|vn2Lq7hIaa	Dump him pronto! Wouldn't be the first relationship a "mother-in-law" has<br>  torn apart. The lesson here is for future parents too, keep your opinions<br>  and advice to yourself, and save a relationship.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|FtyLwqR5aa	No it is not wrong cause it wil only get worse as time goes on.|`|TPN1yIj7aa	yes I'm afraid so, if my husband had judged me by my mother he'd never have married me.
AA10478980	She is at a difficult age now anyway, and this may be part of the changing hormones and changes in her body overall.  She is probably worried about what will happen to her own relationship with her dad.  She probably still wants her mom and her dad to get back together, no matter how illogical that might be - eleven year olds are not logical.  She is just a scared kid, but that doesn't make it any easier for you.  I've raised daughters, and even as their mother I found there were very difficult times through the teenage years, so you have to be prepared for that.  You are correct that it is her father who has to take the lead in handling this situation - it is not your job to discipline her.  You also have to decide if you can be in this relationship for the long haul, because this situation with the eleven year old may last a while.  Probably all that you can do is to continue to be pleasant to her, to try to do special things with her, and to work with your partner and agree on how to handle things.  Don't try to be a mother to her, and also don't try to be her "friend".  You are a special adult in her father's life, and it is up to her father to insist that she show you respect.  She does not have to like you.  Can you possibly build on any particular interest of hers - is there something she really enjoys that you could become part of?  It is never easy to be in a new relationship with someone with young children.  The reality is that the children always must come first.  So you need to be willing and able to live with the situation until she no longer sees you as a threat or impostion in her life.|`|AYfJWQuTaa	She is at that difficult age, try to remedy this sooner rather than later, talk to your g/f about it. My brothers marriage was ended partly because of his wife's, daughters interference & trouble making.|`|kprKXEOSaa	Your partner needs to break up with you and put his children first.  Otherwise, this girl is going to end up pregnant at 14.  You can date him again when the kids are 18 and 19.  Don't be selfish and let him raise his daughters.<br>  You can still see him at times when his daughters aren't around.  Don't make him choose between his own flesh and blood and his sex life with you.  Be an adult and put the kid's needs first.<br>  <br>  Wow, I just had a look at some of your other questions.  You definitely need to take my advice and cut this guy and his daughters loose.|`|AA11319441	I don't think sultry is the word your looking for.  You got in the next sentence with  sulks, but I would not use that would to describe an 11 year old.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Id do a 360, and ignore her, smile, polite but act like shes not there. Going to the mall, inform the other in front of her, dont address her, and leave her home, let her chase out the door or stay in with dad. Id keep up this act and see if she starts coming to you, so shes in control of how it all works out with getting along with you. It takes time and patience, in the end you may find, the relationship is not worth the stress. You did all you can do, now let her do what she can do to be friends. Bake cookies with the one daughter, dont invite the other, call dinner time, face to face tell one not the other.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Create a space just for her, whether it's her bedroom or part of some other larger room of the house.  Put some things she enjoys doing there, whether it's artwork, electronics, whatever.  (if she's an outdoors kid, send her outdoors)<br>  <br>  When she is giving the 'tude, send her there.  Do it in a calm manner.  Say, "Go take a little 'alone' time, because you need it until you can be good company for others."<br>  <br>  The oldest child is always the most independent.  When you throw in the complexities of divorce, the oldest can become a "partner" to the parent and the new step-parent can be competition--especially if the birth parent hasn't ever dealt with this issue beforehand.  I have a 12 year old son and have been single-parenting for over 10 years.  I have seen this behavior from my son since he was 3.  lol  I have had to establish a very specific set of household routines and rituals to establish the fact that I am mom, he is child (and not partner) and he has bucked the system every step of the way.  But it is working now that I have a boy friend.  My son is open to the idea of a step dad and really goes the extra mile to behave when he's with us (not saying this is the case when he is not lol).|`|Scupj6XVaa	it sounds like she is jealous and having a really bad time with her father moving on.  I know it is hard to be in your position but you need to keep trying.  maybe you could write her a note and tell her that you are not trying to "steal" her dad away from her.  tell her that you want to have a good relationship with her and her sister.  just keep trying.  at least you get along good with the other child|`|O0HrJO9Jaa	Sounds like my step dads daughter...she was the same to my mom...you just have to either ignore her back or get out...my mom chose to ignore her back and ignore all of her rude comment's etc.  She didn't live with us or anything so it wasn't that difficult to do.  GOOD LUCK!|`|j4PwaY5Jaa	its hard being " THE NEW MOM" to a little girl but you just have to hang in there and if your partner really cared he would stand up for you talk ot him and tell him he needs to do something he cant just sit on his arss and do nothing|`|DTZmqnCkaa	Just be patient and stand behind your man so to speak.  lol  Teens and preteens are moody and difficult, that's their job at that age.  I suggest you let your man handle it and offer him support and eventually that child will mature.  Good luck sir.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Sorry to hear about this. She sounds like a handful!<br>  <br>  You are doing the right thing....and you are being smart. Congratulations!<br>  <br>  Kids can be very mean and manipulative...Sounds like this is the case with this girl. Since you are the grown up here, what's important is that you do what is right...and that your boyfriend sees you are trying!<br>  <br>  I also think that you could stop trying so hard now. <br>  Chances are once your attitude is different, the girl will wonder what happened. I'm not saying be rude...All I'm saying is stop buying her things and trying to get her to like you. Treat both girls equally. <br>  <br>  Kids are not stupid; and I think that once this girl realizes you have stopped "dancing to her tune" she will be puzzled. <br>  <br>  Change things around. She has been in control so far...so now, you take over. No more "Ms.  Extra-Nice GF". Be smart, do what is right, treat the girls fairly and be nice if they deserve it. ((After all, you don't want to be a substitute for their mother. They already have a mother.))<br>  <br>  What they need to understand is that they need to be civil and polite to you, because their dad loves you. But this is difficult for some kids to swallow.<br>  <br>   Be patient. And stop trying so hard to make this girl like you. Who knows? Life is funny. Maybe in a couple of years she will look for you for advice!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Ignore her - as much as you legitimately can.  Keep your contact with her to a minimum.  Include her when necessary but for the most part you need to use reverse psychology...the less time you spend with her and the more time you spend with others will make her eventually come around.  When she hears someone else speaking favorably about you (over and over again...) she'll eventually come around.<br>  <br>  When my dad started seeing someone seriously I was about the same age.  I could see how she operated...she was so overly gushy and overly excited and I couldn't help but think about how fake it all came off...I didn't like her (not from day one) we just didn't have the kind of personalities that meshed.  The best thing she finally did - was to stop being so pushy and to leave me alone!  I was polite and I did what I was told but honestly - there was no love lost there for me...We got on much better when she finally backed off...<br>  <br>  It's been 20 years and my Dad is still "friends" with her - I still think she's a big piece of phony baloney...Sometimes no matter what you do - you can't force someone to like you.
RC8Pxx8eaa	It depends where you are in the UK, I am getting married in Church in June but prior to that we looked a registry offices, they varied from ￡250 - ￡400.<br>  We decided to get married in Church which was our first choice but never thought we could do it as we have both been married before. The Church is costing us ￡250.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Raven it costs ￡40 for the actual ceremony but you have to hire the approved place of marriage so thats why it can run into hundreds.|`|haCssg2Laa	￡103.50<br>  <br>  ￡30 each to give notice<br>  ￡40 for the ceremony<br>  ￡3.50 for the certificate<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/marriages/how-much-will-it-cost/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/marria...</a>
hkwBR1moaa	No.  And as long as you make it fancy and look nice, no one will care. Receptions are only as tacky as you make them.  They can be in the nicest place around but still look tacky.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Not strange in the least. Isn't that what most people do?|`|AA11380378	What's the problem? That's what most people do and it's perfectly acceptable. It seems to me that you are too worried to appear "ghetto" -your words- and you are desperatly trying to prove that you are not... thus, exposing your obvious lack of class in the process.<br>  <br>  You are not impressing anyone. Be a lady<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|2o3BHgCCaa	No I would not feel strange at all, considering I have been to wedding actually held on basketball courts!<br>  I think it is a great idea especially as it suits you and your guests.<br>  People are there for you, they don't really care where you have it.|`|mQSk7fB6aa	As long as you create the right atmosphere, it won't matter where you are.|`|crxbob5jaa	It's been done many times before. Go for it!|`|AA10698189	Not a problem at all. You've got to live within your means and if you cant afford a posh hotel so what!  The community centre will be great.  Im sure it can be nicely decorated and all that counts is the bride and groom and most importantly the entertainment - if the entertainment is bad then that can ruin the wedding!  good luck!|`|37803e6c4f82e6a134d585be72409c93aa	This is your wedding! Whatever you and your fiance decides will be ok. Family and Friends are suppose to be there to celebrate you'll joyous occasion and no worry about if the place is acceptable. Good Luck!|`|by9KuBizaa	The piece of information you didn't say is the location of the community center.  If it's 4 hours away from the wedding.... I would not attend|`|I7QcHkLFaa	Not strange at all.<br>  You can decorate how you want so would be fine.|`|0s3evdb1aa	Decorate your site and it will look way nicer than many a bland function suite in a hotel.|`|cgQqHJtKaa	My nephew had his wedding reception at a community center last May. It was elegant. <br>  <br>  What I find strange, is YOU thinking there would be anything wrong with it.|`|DTGraJHdaa	I say, do what your budget says. I had my wedding reception in a church dinning hall and served soul food. Not too many people I know except for me appreciates fancy food. I love it. Love to cook it too. I personally believe that it doesn't matter where you decide to have your reception, you can serve whatever you want. When people start pitching in finances for it, then they have a say in the outcome. Since you are paying for all the expenses, go with what you want. <br>  <br>  Decorations is a must . If you are having fancy food, then serve it well.<br>  You can go to any store like Walmart and purchase nice dishes, flatwear, flutes, etc... But if you are on a budget, it is best to rent them from a party rental or the person catering the food. Use cotton table cloths and napkins. You can order those online from anywhere that stuff is sold.<br>  <br>  Use silk floral arrangements in eiffel tower vases. This brings that elegance that you are looking for with your meal. I have a site you can order the flowers from to make your centerpieces. Also use rose petals on your tables and possibly floral swags. Tea light candles works very well. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usifloral.com/mini-rose-bud-bush-with-amaranthus-lavender-p-4013.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usifloral.com/mini-rose-bud-b...</a> for your flowers.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wholesaleflowersandsupplies.com/store/c/776-Eiffel-Tower-Vases.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wholesaleflowersandsupplies.c...</a> for your vases.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mulberry-Scented-Clear-Cup-Tealights/dp/B001DNSVIQ/ref=wl_it_dp?ie=UTF8&coliid=I3DPOBF6GD62P0&colid=RN7YAXNVEOMD" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Mulberry-Scented-C...</a> for your candles.<br>  <br>  Tell me what you think.

xvey8ixPaa	So, she brings in $6,000 a month? Tithing is supposed to be only 10 percent. And, God never demanded it. Not saying how much she makes, $600  a month sounds a bit much unless she groses $6,000 a month, then it is a good figure and you two should be figuring out how to live on the rest, most people would never have any trouble with that....I really wish I had $5,400 to live on a month....|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	I think she has the right idea about tithing, but...I see your point and I know God would want you to take care of yourself first. Maybe she could tithe alittle less, at least for a while. It won't be long you and she will be on the road to financial success and then you can tithe all you want.  I believe she thinks the more she tithes the more she will recieve., but God knows our hearts and he would want you to take care of yourself.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	This is a great question for the two of you to take to your pastor.  This is a terrible question to take to the world-wide-web (no offense).<br>  <br>  Tithing as Christians is highly specific to the particular teaching you are given in the particular faith you are following.  The New Testamament is unclear about tithing.<br>  <br>  Except this:  God loves a cheerful giver (if you can't give cheerfully, God doesn't need the money).|`|GQUaFGHLaa	Giving $600 a month to your church is alot of money. If you need other things then you need to only give what you can to the church. I sometimes don't give anything to the church if I have other things that we need. I am lucky if I have a dollar to give sometimes.|`|45UTKuamaa	the tithing thing as i understand the bible said something about 10% to God and 10% of 0=0|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Charity starts at home. Take care of your own finances, get yourself set up and soon you'll be able to help others....<br>  <br>  If you fail first, you help no one.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	Lots of people work and go to school.  You don't have to work full time, just part time to help with expenses.  She's right in that your tithe is supposed to come off the top and you should have faith that the Lord will provide.  However, that doesn't mean sit at home when you are capable of working.  I think you are capable of holding down a part time job and going to school.  Some folks even do it while they work full time.  You are the man of the household and you need to do what you feel like is best for your family.  I say get a part time job and continue to tithe.|`|iwIrQ4ncaa	it sounds like she is doing the right thing, but how about praying to God and asking him if he would accept a lower tithe amount from the two of you until things get better for you financially.|`|jTtNE6dmaa	Ruth is spot on with this one.  Great advice!|`|TPwCrRz4aa	trust in the lord he will take care of your needs|`|xzMUxGpgaa	Since your wife knows you better then any of us, it very well could be true that if you started to work, you might drop out of school. <br>  <br>  Today's times are very tough on our pockets and paychecks. A lot of times we do have to pick between buying one thing over another. Only you and your wife knows for sure rather the two of you can cut back in other areas or if there is a way you two can do without certain things. <br>  <br>  I have a friend that is going through this same thing, except her husband got laid off from work. His income at this time is cut in half. She went to the church and told them she felt bad, but what should she do? She was told, not to worry about it, that people are hurting right now and that God wants her to take care of her family and their needs. God loves family and wants us to take care of ourselves. She felt a lot better after their talk.<br>  <br>  See, my friend, you will someday be getting a job and hopefully will be bringing in a good income. You said you are not working so you can finish school quickly, so before long you will be bringing home a paycheck too. Once that starts, if you so desire and feel the need, give extra at that time to make up for when you could not. You have got to remember, God does not want you to barely have enough money for food. <br>  <br>  In time, you will see that things will work out for you and your wife. Please explain to her that God is not getting the money personally, it is the church, which is in place to help spread God's word and the money the church gets helps keep it running. So, if you give later, when your money situation gets better or if you give now, does not really matter. The churches are always in need. It will still be there though, with or without you and your wife's money. Make it up later. I think God would rather have you stay healthy, eat healthy, get a good education, get a good job and give when you possible can. Just remember to keep God in your heart and do not worry, as God knows what is in your heart too. It will get better, I promise.  Aunt DeeDee.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	So your wife is pulling in $6,000 a month after tax's (supposed to be 10% right)?  If she makes that much than why in hell are you guys struggling that much unless you are over-spending?  Maybe you need to down grade on the fancy expensive European cars etc..<br>  <br>  At any rate, tell her either to reduce her tithing until the situation changes or you will get a job. You're an f-ing adult and you are going into debt..be a man and go get a job (your wife isn't your mother).  Just tell her flat out that while you understand her fear that you refuse to live in debt and you will meet your obligations.
jLKcuMNraa	this might sound cliche but i used to be the same way. i didnt want to be in a relationship because i didnt want to have to "check in" with him to see if he was busy or wanted to do something. until i met my boyfriend. we've been together two years now. its easy when you find the right person. you dont feel forced to have to call them or ask about everything you do.|`|ztb7OCvyaa	You're not selfish. I like my personal space too. You just have to make sure to find someone who's compatible with you. If you find someone else who's very independent and also wants personal space they will respect the fact that you need yours too. That's how my relationship works. And if you are really right for each other it won't feel like a chore to spend time with the other person when are together. You'll be able to find someone who feels the way you do.|`|441002ba222c31246fd283fc8f2694bfaa	I would say to remember that everyone needs to worry about what they want first. If you want to spend some time alone just let the guy know.

You need to find a man that values independence as much as you do and has his own life. <br>  <br>  2. Ask yourself, do you really want to be in a relationshp right now or do you just want some when you need it?<br>  <br>  3. it sounds like you may have commitment issues. in which case you need to find out why and figure out how to resolve them <br>  <br>  4. you should tell the person you're seeing in the beginning that you value your independence and need an equal amount of  me-time and we-time, You need to let them know that you can't be joined at the hip with them, you're just not that kind of girl<br>  <br>  5. you just haven't found the right guy. when you do find him, you will want to be with him and you will want him to be with you. plus, i think the right guy for you will understand and appreciate your independence, as it will mean he can maintain his independence as well|`|G1fDp1PEaa	OK the answer is not everyone has someone!

J9LZwAMraa	I'm going to tell you the truth, and its not want you want to hear but i can see you don't have allot of support but here it goes.<br>  <br>  First, this girl, she is no good, the only reason why you keep going back is because she seems like shes the only one that you can go back too. She is going to keep causing problems in your life and you don't need that right now (or ever). You will be much happier without her in the long run, BELIEVE ME. Also once a cheater always a cheater ( but i give her some credit that she told you at least...)<br>  <br>  Second, Don't ever think about suicide, its a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Now when i say temporary, it can mean years. But things always get better, even when things just keep getting worse, trust me things will work them self out... You just have to keep trying.<br>  <br>  There is no simple solution to fix every thing in your life but i would suggest start slow. Like your dad, your did sounds kind of like the stereotypical father, who is kind of "harsh", so it makes it hard to talk to him but i could be totally wrong about him (i don't mean to sound like i am degrading him or any think because i'm not), but regardless if he is hard to talk to, you should try to say your sorry and talk to him about how your feeling about every thing... If you wont listen then talk to someone else, even a psych...I'm sure the military provides one?<br>  - talking is the first step, you will feel so much better!-<br>  <br>  Then you might want to start doing some thing, like joining clubs, or making friends. Sounds lame but something along these lines will help your lonnelyness... I mean you should even try speed dating =]<br>  - just go out and have fun, without doing drugs or drinking-<br>  <br>  You should also, if you can afford, go on a vaction! If you can't do that then just take a drive, research whats around you, and just do it. <br>  -gataway and leave your worries-<br>  <br>  <br>  Goodluck,<br>  Drew<br>  <br>  P.S You should look up ways online how to avoid/prevent and manage your depression. It will be worth all your time... If worse comes to worse, talk to a doctor!|`|7EfUQ1MZaa	well you have to let her goo. even tho it will hurts <br>  you have to find someone else that want hurt you while your gone even tho you will think about her all the time someone that you can trust that want cheat on you likes she did going back to someone that <br>  hurts you will hurts you even more <br>  <br>  cuz i sorta kind of finger it out my self cuz i was with this boy he was trying to two time me and i knew it and even tho he was talking to her i knew if i keep trying to be with him he will hurt me even more so i move on even tho i felt so longly wanting someone <br>  i finally found someone who want hurt me that will want nobody but me|`|WFP46Ek9aa	THIS IS MESSED UP!

Never beg anyone to be with you, that just make it known that you will put up with anything that they do.  You are still young and have your whole life in front of you.  You will meet so many different people in your life time.  But remember no one can love you until you love yourself.|`|avhYoGREaa	Looks like you can..<br>  A. Try and get her back, then leave her in a year only to crush her.<br>  B. Leave her behind, she's fickle anyhow, you wouldn't want to live in constant fear that she's being unfaithful.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	I would get over this girl. It seems like she has caused you nothing but trouble, and she is not nearly as devoted as you are. Don't waste your time on her anymore, there are lots of girls who are better|`|AA11390428	You are crazy, block headed and tough.|`|EBKu42wFaa	HARD PLACE|`|l1JGL1DCaa	Tough life|`|PCw1zDtsaa	Oh no,<br>  <br>  I am sorry that she cheated on you.. That's because she really did not care for you. Some people are there to listen to your problems and be comforters for a short period of time. If you are going to date her Short Term, its fine.. This is not the girl you want to marry. I believe that your dad will get over the car, but the world would be nothing without you. You are not wrong for making a mistake, if you really felt bad about making it. I believe that you deserve to live and I know that in due time if you surround yourself around the right people you will be highly cared about. So, please choose life and understand that life has various paths and decisions. Only you can make it better by striving. What better choice can you make than serving your country?<br>  Good Job, I hope this helps you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ejiipt" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/ejiipt</a>|`|ca4XiOJMaa	wow that is alot to grasp to start im sorry you had to go through that ...but you should take her back after what she has done to you just to feel the need for a girl if thats all you wanted go hook up with a slut that will do any one what your looking for its doesnt seem like you will find in her i hope you think about it before you make your decision its not a good idea to go with someone who you used to really like that hurt you that badly you will just feel more lonley after she does it to you again ....and you should already be thinking she will... its seems she is that kind of person that she has to have more than one guy at a time ..leave her alone ...find someone else ...you can do it!! be strong...hey you should send me a mess on yahoo sometime or mayb aol.... mandie.harris@yahoo.com(yahoo)... cutemandie1991(aol)

pGIOz14Faa	My husband is obsessive compulsive about the phone as well.  In fact if he finds he has left the house without it he almost breaks into a sweat.  And yet, he is always talking about how he hates it.  I have just had to set some boundaries like:  neither of us answers our phone when we are eating, or having an important discussion.  Occasionally his eye wanders to where it is longingly but I have told him, give me 30 minutes and then you can caress your phone again. :)|`|1hciyvKdaa	Wow, Id not put up with that. Id tell him, me or the phone, that is very rude, hes very immature. Make him make a choice you or him. (Put the phones on billable/suspend) when you guys are home on the weekend, let him think its broke, lol then turn them back on) I know Verizon will do this not sure about other carriers. Get your esn numbers, and you should be able to go online and deactivate and reactivate. IDK I just know I would not do this. Id refuse to go anywhere with him and his cell, if he was making millions on these phone calls or it was part of his job, thats one thing, but these are not needed calls.|`|AA11967247	uhm,, no. but it would seem as your both big talkers.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	MAN......... I got stressed out just reading that. HOw do you put up with it? I would of already snapped right there in front of everyone while he was doing it. I would make him turn off the phone when there is something like that going on. Ones cell phone should be turned off anyway when there is an appointment going on. Does he have to answer it during sex also? That would draw the line for me. If he was mine he would of went through so many phones by now. He would be top customer at AT&t.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	First I'd have a chat about the appropriate times one answers their cell...the second time, there would be no talk.  It would be me grabbing the stupid phone and smashing it on the ground.  Yup, there are some conversations that are in need of some hands on reinforcement...|`|V1GKJh8zaa	Sounds to me like he's not feeling respectful of those outside himself. There may be stress in his life that he's not talking with you about. Seeing a counselor seems like the best bet. <br>  <br>  Men who love their women and treat them rudely are not thinking of anyone except themselves for various reasons. Reading Men are Like Waffles and Women are Like Spaghetti will help you understand 'man' thinking.<br>  <br>  However, I still stand by my comment that is seems a counselor is needed right now. He's obviously not sharing something - and may not even know how to share it.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|iCwlR3mPaa	Next time that happens, just grab the phone, tell whoever is on the line that he is suddenly busy and not to call back but will call as soon as he is free and then switch it off.  If you do that 3 or 4 times, more during IMPORTANT times, he will get the message.<br>  <br>  My brother in Europe used to call at odd hours, in the middle of the night or during the wee hours of the morning and my husband hated it. <br>  One day i told him to call during the daytime, our time,  unless its an emergency.  The reason, i told him that we were having sex and he had just disturbed us.  That was the last time he called during the night.|`|mbYdd4UUaa	Unfortunately he is a very busy person, especially with his phone. You have to sit down with him and talk nice not angry, explain to him  that things in life would be a priority. If not emergency, he does not have to answer his phone call especially if something is going on, that has to be resolved at the moment. Then he could return all his phone calls in the proper time.It seems like his phone friends are his family, so you are still lucky cuz some have textmates or phonepals/friends. you have to explain to him not yell so he will understand over a nice dinner date or lunch or even breakfast.. Good luck
AA11380378	Peopel do not do that kind of clique stuff nowdays anyway. Good for you that you refused to be yet another cookie cutter bride.<br>  <br>  As far as new traditions, your sundae bar sounds splendid. Think ouside the box. <br>  <br>  My husband and I cut our cake with a sword instead of the tired old cake server set. He is in the military, so we could get away with that. <br>  <br>  What about blak jack tables for those that don't dance? Or revive some old costums that have been old forgotten? Like the wedding lazo (tying the knot), or bridesmaid cake favors to pull out of the cake on a string.<br>  <br>  We were going to have an ice sculpute with lights inside that resembled a light house (beach wedding) and made it hold either ice cream or water bottles (summer wedding). We loved this idea but our venue didn't have a large enough frezeer to hold it teh night before and we had to abandon the idea.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|xFv6LirIaa	Since its informal maybe you could have a ring toss competition.  Find rings that are big enough to go over the bouquet and whoever can ring it gets the bouquet and it doesnt have to mean they are next in line for marriage.   Or you could toss the bouquet to all the older married women and whoever catches it gets a gift certificate for 2 at a nice restaurant.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	let the goomsmen have a go at the bride or let the groom have a go at the bridesmaids.|`|uij93NOjaa	Some fun things that My husband and I did was print out lyrics to our song so that our guest would serenade us! Also, when we were about to have dinner after all the speech's were done we did sort of a copy thing. We had our guest couples ( the ones who volunteered)  do whatever kiss they wanted and we had to imitate it. Lastly, we did a little game with the both of us. We had to sit back to back and take one of our shoes off and give it to each other, so that in each hand I had my shoe and his shoe. The DJ would ask questions like, who do you think will be taking out the garbage? And we would have to raise a shoe to  match who we think will be doing it...........of course i raised his haha!! It was just a lot of fun and it made the guests roar.|`|2c2W4zQJaa	Set up a video booth (like a photo booth) where guests could record best wishes to the couple, or tell stories of how they know the bride/groom,  tell jokes, sing, or whatever comes to mind.

1Ayb4UK7aa	There is nothing that says an engagement or wedding ring 'has' to be diamond.  My engagement ring is diamond and sapphires.  We got some strange looks at jewelry stores but it was what we wanted and our money so we got exactly what we wanted.  You are the one that will be wearing it so don't worry about what anyone else thinks.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	traditionally amethyst is given to protect you from poison/drunkenness also to help you sleep.<br>  <br>  that aside, it's entirely up to the wearer what you want as an engagement ring. most people have diamonds but it isn't the law.<br>  <br>  personally, I think the amethyst would look classier smaller with 16 smaller diamonds around it (a little like Princess Diana's, but her centre stone was sapphire)|`|7G4hisdzaa	Your engagement ring should be a ring you are excited to wear.  If an amethyst does it for you, go for it.<br>  Don't worry about what others think of your ring. :)<br>  Congrats!|`|7efe69c2d9a0b4d3a0798d71a2f5ea43aa	my engagement ring is a blue stone (sapphire). I too have a ruby birthstone, but like sapphires better. <br>  I like rings that have color stones better than diamonds.|`|AA11380378	I think is fine. Whatever fits your personal style and budget.<br>  <br>  Goo dluck|`|6UmRmaeWaa	Let's be honest here. People say it's your ring get what you want...WRONG! I have the future husband that is the most traditional man ive ever met! I didn't want the plain ring with the diamond center...but that is what he got me.<br>  <br>  All I can say is that I LOVE IT! The fact that we looked together , he saw what I liked and I saw what he liked and they were totally different. I love my ring because it is from him, what he choose is never anything I would pick out but....It's wonderful. <br>  <br>  Try to compromise diamond with Amethyst side stones? I love the fact that you like to step out of the box and be different. I thought I was the only one!<br>  <br>  Congrats to you with whatever ring you decide on!|`|AA11603468	I like the idea of doing things that make sense to you personally rather than simply because you're expected to do them. I think "because that's how it's done" is a dumb reason to do something. If you want the amethyst, then I think that's what you should have. I wouldn't want anything but a diamond as my engagement ring, but that's me, and shouldn't have any effect on the stone you wish to wear as your engagement ring.<br>  <br>  As an alternative to the amethyst, you could also go for whatever his birthstone is (which would add another dimension of significance to the ring) or the stone that represents your wedding month.|`|RbdPDXQNaa	I agree that Diamonds are boring...yes they sparkle, but if another stone means more to you and fits your style there is nothing wrong with it.  I personally did not want a diamond engagement ring.  My favorite color is purple and so I researched different gems.  I was close to getting an Amethyst stone; however, I spoke with a gemologist that said it would be to soft for a ring would be wearing everyday.  With that in mind we opted for a purple sapphire which is next to the diamond in hardness.  My center stone is a purple sapphire with a little diamond on each side of it.  I am so pleased with it, and get a lot of complements on it.  A ruby will be a lot harder than amethyst.  I suggest that if you speak with a gemologist.  I know that diamonds and sapphires come in multiple colors (perhaps rubies do to).  Perhaps you should consider a alexandrite (although they can get quite pricey).  My sapphire cost more than a diamond of the same brillance, cut and size.  It definately was not cheap!!!  I am at work otherwise I would post a pix of mine for you to see.|`|AA11620535	I think a wedding ring should be special to you, not necessarily to anyone else.  If you wanted a weaved grass band then that is what you should get.  The idea is simply to represent your love and commitment for each other.  In essence I'll bet that is a "tradition" that even your man's family can come to agreement on.|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	The bottom line is, Its what you are going to wear. You should love whatever it is. Tradition is great, if your into that. I have seen people be engaged with many different stones. I have even seen a Tahitian black pearl engagement ring. You can do whatever you guys feel represents you the best. GO FOR IT!|`|iMY2fgYdaa	you shouldn't care what anyone thinks about it at all...his family included. Its your ring and his gift to you and thats all that matters. Just because the world goes ga ga for diamonds doesn't mean you have to. I think its a great way to express your style! Go for it!!!|`|1HLPznZhaa	If you like  Amethyst I know of no reason you shouldn't  have your "special" ring with this stone.. Anyone who has a problem with that should be ignored..if asked and you feel you have to give an answer just tell them it is your preference !!|`|TNH8QMOaaa	Its awesome and unique too. Engagement ring with amethyst as a center stone sound quite good. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  B2CJewels.com<br>  <a href="http://www.b2cjewels.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.b2cjewels.com/</a>|`|R4WX5twzaa	Why do you care what other people think? You want to walk around for the rest of your life wearing a ring that you never wanted in the first place? Go with what you like and what you want, and don't worry about other peoples' opinions.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I'm not crazy about that specific tiffany ring, but love the idea!<br>  <br>  I have an aquamarine center stone in my engagement ring and I absolutely LOVE it.|`|I7QcHkLFaa	It is your wedding ring get what you want and can afford.<br>  A wedding ring does not make a marriage|`|EfuT8y4Gaa	Amethyst is my birthstone so I would love it..|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	I was going to say if your birth stone was amethyst, but it's not.  Amethyst is not that precious of a stone, that's why it might not be the best idea to make it your engagement ring stone.  Save it for other jewelry.  Not your engagement ring.<br>  Go with the classic diamond (diamonds are forever) or ruby, or even sapphire or emerald.  <br>  Diamonds are the hardest (least likely to crack).  Your amethyst isn't so tough.<br>  Or -- if you don't like diamonds -- what about a colored diamond, like pink or yellow?<br>  <br>  Or if you insist on an amethyst, at least have it surrounded by diamonds.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	well, there is a reason why a diamond is used- not just because it looks pretty. diamonds take thousands of years to create, are the hardest stone, and last forever. diamonds are formed from the dust of the earth and turned into something beautiful. <br>  <br>  im sure you see the meaning there.<br>  <br>  an amethyst just cant compare to that. which is why a diamond is tradtion.<br>  <br>  not only that, but noone will know you are engaged unless you tell them, and you will constantly be having to explain why you have some fairly inexpensive purple gem as your ring.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I think that if you like it, you should go for it.  You have to pick something that you will enjoy wearing.  For me, I prefer diamonds and that's what I have.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I think whatever makes you happy.  This amethyst though is 8.5ct, way too big for regular wear.<br>  <br>  Suggest <br>  <a href="http://www.gemstv.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gemstv.com</a><br>  <br>  The one l like the best is a Rose de France amethyst 2.6ct (9mm) cushion cut for 75 dollars<br>  <br>  I like the Uruguayan amethysts too|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I would love an amethyst engagement ring!  It's my birthstone though and i think its so pretty.  I find diamonds quite boring actually.  The stone on the ring in the picture is too large for my tastes, but if that's what you like, i see nothing wrong with it!  Maybe you could get a center stone of amethyst with some smaller side diamonds.  That way it would glam it up a bit.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I think a little compromise here would work, you say you love rubies and amethyst but traditionally an engagement ring should be diamond, if you dont like diamonds for some reason then why cant you have a gemstone with diamonds too ?|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	An amethyst as a center stone sounds gorgeous. I have never liked diamonds but I love colored stones.

dzbblpjgaa	Your cousin will remain close to you if you do not drive her away. She is still including you up to a point, she has not abandoned you as such. Being shy is horrible, you imagine so much which is not actually happening or likely to happen. You just need a boost but how you haven't quite discovered yet. Look at some options for yourself. <br>  <br>  Meet people but not in a noisey place where everyone wants to party and not talk much. Are there any people you could ask out from work in a group situation? Any skills you could put to use where others could benefit? Just do not sit at home (unless you want to!) and think about your cousin having a good time. She would be delighted for you if you had some good news once in a while. Sulking will not stop her having a good time.<br>  <br>  Sorry you were bullied/picked on but try to remember you are older now and can cope better than you did back then. I realise this probably did not help your confidence.<br>  <br>  One question back to you - What is meant by your description of being an "Old Soul" ? Is that just feeling older than your Chronological years? - Just curious to know :)   Eml Thks|`|4EWCegiRaa	I understand you're point but I think you should use this as a wake-up call that you need to have your own life.  She's spend her whole like being close to you and now, she wants to be independent and do things on her own.  You're in college and in your 20s, you can't hold each other's hand forever.<br>  <br>  Maybe she just feels uncomfortable about it.  You seem like the sensitive type (not in an offensive way) and you're family... how would she say something like "I want my own life" to you?  She'd rather avoid it and do whatever than have that awful conversation (not that she's right if she's dodging the issue but it's really difficult)<br>  <br>  I understand your point but I think you're a little off here... put yourself in her shoes.|`|VC7PyH53aa	Yes, you're overreacting. Don't try to hitch your life to your cousins.<br>  Go make your own, find some new friends, join some new groups, do your own thing. <br>  Obviously your cousin doesn't think the same way about you that you do about her. <br>  Most cousins aren't that close.|`|31b9789366ff5be076f00fbeadf4d573aa	Im sorry to say but you sound so needy. You should go out and make new friends and stop focusing on her life. you should concentrate on your own life only then will anyone be interested in you.
6WdEbMqYaa	I've been in a similar situation, but from the guys perspective. At the time she had usually initiated the "move" and it was up to me to follow through( or at leat it felt that way). It did lead to more tha a few awkward pauses, movements,  etc. but it slowly improved on from there. Try not to forget, that as nervous/ shy you may be, he could be feeling the same way. I was so worried that I would do something wrong, that I would think more about what I could do, and choke(not do anything). So far you've made the moves, now you might just need to hint and try to get him to follow through.|`|GIctGNtJaa	well alot of guys are really shy.....and believe it or not alot of guys like the girls to make the moves...im one of those guys..so if you wanna take it to the next level just do it..he'll think its hot..hope i helped|`|441002ba222c31246fd283fc8f2694bfaa	Well, I usually just say "whats the worst that could happen" and usually its that i need to apologize.<br>  <br>  My girlfriend just get drunk.|`|D0KuQ4Qeaa	well just put it in your mouth your matha fuckin mouth
4RiziMD0aa	just ask her out if she says she is in a relationship there was still no harm done.|`|9gRikg8Kaa	ask her how her love life is?|`|AA11121801	look at her finger to see if she's engaged or married first. then i guess once you two get comfortable enough to ask each other the question, u can ask.<br>  <br>  other than that, you can find out from her friends (if you are familiar with them), or see her on facebook profile etc. <br>  <br>  After all that you still can't find out, then asking her in casual conversation is best solution.|`|WypJADCuaa	Just simply go and ask her to dinner.. If she tells you that she is involved then say that's ok,I would still like to be able to take you to dinner without any strings
uh31vpUkaa	Maybe  the other girl  gets a lot of attention and yr sis has a low self esteem, ? <br>  <br>  Or it cud be just that they are good friends and wanna be like each other??? witch  isn't nowt 2 worry about as there grow out of it :)|`|bHcxSUwtaa	That's a bit strange... Maybe she's just insecure of her own look. You should try talking to her about it. Tell her you prefer her, as your sister, to the girl she's trying to be.|`|onrcmQf8aa	Your sister is insecure.  But,  it's normal for trends to start.
fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	There is an old saying that goes, "if you love something, set it free, if it comes back to you, it's yours, if it doesn't, it never was." I think that definitely applies to you.<br>  <br>  If you beg and plead and carry on, it's just going to drive her further away. You should try not being available so much when she calls. Try to avoid calling her and simply don't make yourself so available that she knows you are always there. If you do that, maybe it will make her realize what she's lost. It will be tough to do, but that is the only way she will ever decide for herself and that's what she has to do.|`|4EWCegiRaa	I'M GOING TO BE HONEST:<br>  <br>  You want her back?  You want her to want you?  Then there's 1 thing you have to do:  Stop being an whiny little boy!<br>  <br>  All this "we argued alot but were always in love" stuff is BS because the only thing that matters if that you argued all the time.  Maybe if you argued less, she'd be more open to talking.  Who wants to argue and then talk all the time... it's draining and exhausting.<br>  <br>  All this "don't give me negative answers" stuff is BS because that's not what she wants.  She wants you to be strong and just do whatever it is she needs you to do.  She does NOT need you to be whiny about it.  She does NOT need to you be weak.  She does NOT need you to be all "we're meant to be more" like some loser from a far too sappy novel.  <br>  <br>  ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS!  Stop being such a b*tch and be the man she needs you to be.  Show her you love, do things to show you her, and stop being a little boy.  Not "we argue but love each other"; you want "I don't argue with her because I love her"|`|Bt1D1wWuaa	Sadly, I don't think you're going to be able to "win" her back.  When she said the "spark" is gone, that is code for she has moved on and most likely there is someone else she is seeing or interested in.  <br>  Sorry, but that's my interpretation.  And the last thing you want to happen is to be accused of stalking or having her get a restraining order which very well could happen if you don't back off when she tells you to.   Good Luck|`|c177b6236d4e423617ec27290ee2f0c7aa	Don't be there when she calls you to 'just speak'. Not in an aggressive manner, it'll just happen that you 'were out' or 'had things to do' - be nice when you do get to speak to one another, but stop courting her. Lead her into believing that your social life is active; don't point at a potentially existing other gf, (that's rubbish behavior) but be strictly matter-of-fact when she calls and never ever let her see what is really in your heart. She's either someone who doesn't know what she wants (and it's not you who has to point that out to her), someone who is now only passing time with you (that is not what you want) or you're just fixated on her (but it has to work both way). This little experiment will make her look for answers instead of you.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I have been in the same situation before and you can'r really win anyone back. You need to leave her alone for a while which I know is very hard to do. Then you can talk to her about how you are feeling and maybe you can work things out. This may not happen instantly it can take some time.|`|wNA0YGNXaa	If you cannot find answer, you won't get her.|`|vBILi33Caa	Okay. This might work or it might not.

("Emotional Rehab") - which is basically just my way of saying "time to go cold turkey". <br>  <br>  2) Do erase their telephone number from your mobile phone <br>  <br>  text messaging is such a HUGE thing, delete their name and number from your mobile phone (and address book) straight away. You may also be able to bar their number from your phone. Deleting ex's details will save you phoning or texting at 4am to ask "Why? Why? Why?" you were dumped, or save you from begging your ex, drunkenly, to take you back. That method seldom (if ever) works for reconciliation. It often has the adverse effect. Who enjoys getting woken up in the middle of the night by someone's incoherent rantings? Or by being bombarded by text messages from someone that just doesn't seem to get the hint. <br>  <br>  3) Do delete their old emails and their handle from your online "buddy" lists <br>   DELETE all of the old emails between you, If that seems to drastic, at least put them onto a disc or burn them CD and put them somewhere where you won't be tempted to continually re-read each one over and over. You just end up torturing yourself. <br>  <br>   remove and block them from your buddy lists.even quite harmless to keep in touch with your ex via email or instant messaging programs, but the only one you're fooling is yourself. I'm guilty of that one too! Often you just end up spying on them, checking to see when they are on (and wondering who they are talking to if it's not you!), <br>  <br>  In a weird sort of way, keeping in touch electronically is a form of denial. to stay in the relationship even when the other person isn't physically there anymore. <br>  <br>  <br>  4) Don't sit around staring at the mementos <br>  Put away the letters, pictures and any personal belongings of your ex. Box them up and put them in a closet or somewhere equally out of sight. some people have ceremonial burnings, but that may be a bit drastic, and after you're calmer and have healed, you may even regret it. <br>  <br>  For starters, just box up all of the stuff until you feel ready to face it. Eventually you'll be able to look at the holiday snaps without feeling sick to your stomach but not right now. <br>  <br>  <br>  5) Do use a journal or notebook to vent your pain, anger, frustration & so <br>  forth <br>  <br>  never underestimate the power of pouring the words out onto a page. This generally exceptionally good for men, as a lot of men don't have an outlet for their emotions and pain. During the healing process often we don't feel like we are improving, and the notebook or diary will show you just how far you have come if you read it after a few weeks or months. It is incredibly cathartic and it just may stop you from saying things to your EX you may later regret. You'd try writing letters to your EX that you don't actually send. <br>  <br>  6) Do enjoy yourself out<br>  Do something so simple as to having a manicure, facial or a massage. Play with your cats, hangout with honest friends, . Treat yourself as you would want that someone 'special' to treat you. Have candle lit dinners - with all of your favorite foods - just for you. You're worth it. <br>  <br>  7) Do buy new bedding & change your surroundings <br>  It may sound silly but it's very powerful step that you can take to cleanse the situation and start fresh. some people actually go out and buy whole new beds. If you can afford, go for it. There is something to be said for sleeping in bedding with no history and no memories. The same can be said by changing the wallpaper or repainting an area <br>  <br>  <br>  8) Don't rebound <br>  Give yourself plenty of time to heal from this break-up. Many people begin dating before they are really recovered.<br>  Try refrain from immediately trying to find someone to replace your EX and fill that void. Better to work through your pain fully before returning to the dating pool. <br>  Don't bet on it. Dating too soon often leads to comparisons to your EX, makes you feel lonelier than not dating did, and can actually set you back further, emotionally, than before you had started to date again. As much as we think this bright, sexy, intelligent person makes us feel so good, at the end of the day, they won't really be able to fill this VOID in you. Only YOU can really make YOU happy. So the trick is to be happy within yourself before you start to date again<br>  <br>  Don't listen to the negative self-talk <br>  Remember, just because your EX may no longer find you desirable or want to be in a relationship with you, doesn't mean that no one else ever will. It just means your EX doesn't. So what? You are still you. You are still whole, complete and perfect just as you are and any of your mistakes is on how you’ll fix it on yourself, not your ex. he’s not a God. it will do you good to keep reminding yourself of that. <br>  <br>  10) Do take charge of your life - the world is your oyster<br>  Use your time to alone to focus on yourself and your own goals in life. You can take a course in cooking, pick up a new hobby or learn planting flowers- whatever <br>  Get up off the sofa as soon as you can. While some regrouping time is necessary, <br>  at some point you should try to get in yourself back in shape and back in the land <br>  of the living|`|EvDmgWjvaa	Spend time with friends and do things that will make you a better person inside & out.

Goodluck and best wishes.=)|`|Jz2cY8XUaa	it sounds liek you are being pretty considerate ...but i still think this is something that you have to begin talking about (and not joking about) with her because...in reality...if she IS going to move with you and follow you evrywhere you go...she's going to be doing things that only you want and maybe she does enjoy traveling but you need to ask her what her goals in life are as well, and what she plans to do once she is done with her bachelors degree..because maybe she'll say yes to you and want to go live and travel with you and wherever your business takes you buit the last thing you would want is for her to regret that decision and be regretful the whole time she spends there with you.|`|tWvM6M0raa	i do not think your asking to much<br>  if it was me i would say yes<br>  <br>  it would be a awesome opportunity for anyone, and it is not like you don't have a house<br>  <br>  it might be difficult if you haven't lived together before though.<br>  <br>  if she does move you will need to make sure she stays in contact with friends and family<br>  <br>  good luck :)<br>  <br>  mine please?<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222165229AAnifXI&r=w">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|J6SWB7r3aa	Sounds great!

hgaNxhoaaa	It seems to me that many people have a default friend they go to in times of need, stress, or joy. I do not have one of these, so I wouldn't say you're abnormal. However, maybe you do have a friend like this and it's possible you don't realize it. Do a friend inventory--think of something you need help with (jumping your car, editing a paper, borrowing money) and go through your list and try to imagine which friends would help you. I'd say the ones that would help you would be really good friends.|`|f2ZNJy48aa	No. It's not normal. By college, you should have friends that you can count on. Join more clubs or activities to find more friends. That's not good that you only have acquaintances. You have to have real friends. You don't want to spend the rest of your life alone...do you? Good luck!|`|pgBHEesTaa	there's absolutely nothing wrong with that! its hard to find good friends! <br>  But maybe u should get closer to some of them, try a bit harder.|`|5vgnrvcmaa	Only in the great United States can we not unite with our fellow man.

Everybody has at least one good friend that they can depend on. If your acquaintances aren't people you don't think you can depend maybe you should drop them and find one good friend.|`|g7gvzhkpaa	I have the same problem , I know people but to talk to somebody about important stuff I don't have that either your not the only one .|`|vqJTgq4kaa	Absolutley nothing wrong with it.|`|x2l1sK5waa	yah, it's normal. =) don't worry, well, finding some real good friends might take some time.
979090faf6f85c0f0923e03261b8a308aa	if she wants to wait then you wait. its her body so you got no right to try to get her to do somthing she doesn't want... i guess i would be frustrated if i were you but you shuoldn't get mad... i think she should have told you form the begining that she didn't want to have sex tills eh was married but  we ill make mistakes so dont make the mistake of trying to make her have sex with you...|`|fr1jbLA3aa	Just remember: What has been done can never be reversed. Respect your girlfriend, and she'll really admire a man who respects her wishes and can wait. This is also kinda a "test" and if you pass it the results will be worthwhile, so just hang on a little longer buddy.|`|avhYoGREaa	Just wait it out.<br>  You'll sleep a lot better when your married anyway...if you catch my drift.|`|DmqjprCcaa	AMEN to her for her decision!!! there aren't many girls left in this world it seems that will wait until marriage to have sex. thats the reason we have so many teen pregnancies and single parents. if you truly love her then you would respect her decision to wait until after marriage. i realize that since she studies abroad then marriage is a long way off but time will fly and before you know it it will be here, especially when you start thinking about all the wedding plans and everything. TRUE LOVE WAITS!!!!! again if you truly do love her and are not just with her for the sex then you will respect her decision and wait until after you tie the knot to have sex. you shouldnt pressure her to do something she doesnt want to do. its just not right to pressure a girl to have sex when they dont want to. she might want to have sex, but knows its not right until after you're married.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Sounds like quite a woman.  I suggest you hang onto her.|`|caArlzCvaa	lol<br>  <br>  u should respect her decision. when a person loves another so much, they would respect each others opinion;expecially when it comes to sex. <br>  Not to be telling u in a mean way, but dont be constantly asking her or wanting to change her decision. I would feel like this guy just seems to want one thing rather then truly loving me and respecting me.<br>  <br>  saving it for marragie is a wonderful thing becuase u give urself to someone u are partnered with in ur life.|`|WypJADCuaa	It's tough buddy.. No she is not wrong at all.. She is right it is her gift to give... Why rush the moment... If you Truly and deeply are in love with her then the wait will definitely be worth it.. Don't rush her into doing something that she isn't ready to do.. YOUR TIME WILL COME... PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE|`|NxZl1Qccaa	she is not wrong at all,i think you should actually hang on to her girls like her are rare. and besides if you really love her you would understand and wait.|`|hrU14wMDaa	She has every right to change her mind. Why would you feel betrayed by this? Her body and her choice.|`|2hyP31E9aa	Every relationship requires sex at some point, some sooner than others. If anything and im assuming this is her first time, its gonna hurt for her..a lot..and to wait till marriage to stick it in and not be able to do anything is gonna suck besides she can still give you somthing out of it doesnt haft to be her virginity. Could be a position or maybe oral or somthing i dunno but point is sexual relationships are very important and like i lalways say if you dont pet your dog your dog will go find someone who will pet him

It seems like you both lvoe each other a lot, but he has this feeling you want more than he can give. From what i read you have done all you can, and he definitely shouldn't have been snappy when he said no about the shoulder, but you should have forgiven him when he came back and said he was sorry. Maybe he screwed up and is afraid of what you think. You two need to sit down and have a talk starting with. "Listen, I love you, you need to tell me whats going on before this turns into a real problem." Make sure you explain that he is what you want.

AA10065812	???<br>  Well, she could have taken a used condom and impregnated herself.  <br>  <br>  Also, she could have filed a claim on him, to which he may or may not have been notified about, ignored it figuring he had never slept with the woman, than got a default order.  A lot if Active Duty military are getting hit with those because they can't return to fight them.<br>  <br>  The problem is, regardless of how she got pregnant, he has to pay child support.  Whether or not he's the father of the child, once there's an order in place, he has to pay.<br>  <br>  Them wanting $5200 means it's an old order or retroactive.  If it's a new order, he can fight it.  If it's a default order for a woman he never slept with, he's stuck.  <br>  <br>  File for custody.  Though he cannot use DNA evidence to stop an order, she can use it to stop a custody challenge, but if she does, she loses the child support claim.<br>  <br>  I’ve been a Father’s Rights Advocate for 20 years.   <br>  <br>  Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.  Also, learn how to make sure the judge is being balance is his decision by using Court Watch.<br>  <br>  Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.  <br>  <br>  Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  You’re that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  Take the time to learn what you can and should do.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/DadsHouse/">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...</a><br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.parentalalienation.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentalalienation.org/</a>|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Court records are public information.

He simply would have had to have impregnated the woman before he met you.  Personally, if a man has ever had sex, I think it's kind of silly to assume he has fathered no children, unless he kept in contact for at least several months with every woman with whom he has had sex.  I think it is highly unlikely that I have any children I don't know about, but is it possible?  Yeah, it is.|`|2ba40000b05c80f1026052730a2733afaa	Your husband had better take this seriously!!  His denial is hurting your marriage.  If he truly did not have sex with this girl he needs to get a paternity test done ASAP to save your marriage!  Insist upon it, if he resists, figure he is lying to you.  An honorable man would have already begun the process to have the test.  <br>  <br>   Good chance you need an attorney (I mention this because a man I knew was in the same boat, he didn't have the money for an attorney nor a paternity test.  It became "he said vs. she said" plus she was adding the sex was actually a rape.  This man had an awful public defender and ended up in jail for 6 years.There's still no guarantee the child his his but he has to pay child support even after serving 6 years in jail! ) <br>  <br>  If the paternity test comes out the child is his, he will be paying child support for the next 18-21 years plus he lied to you.  It's time you grow up and realize what you have for a marriage.  <br>  <br>  If the tests come out negative, he is not the father, then you owe him a giant apology....but I'd still be worried about his refusal to immediately rectify the problem.|`|fMEypXDYaa	You can take the case number; it will be listed in the letter, and contact the court clerk and request information about the case, your husband can request a DNA test to see if he is the real father, some women will file a claim and hope that the man in question won't know to ask about one, or if they used to date before you meet him, that he is the father of the child, either way, you can find out what you need to know from the information on the letterhead. It is not 'cut and dried' just because a claim has been made.

He needs to contact this person and have a paternity test done (wouldn't hurt to have a lawyer).<br>  <br>  Edit:  The envelope should have had a return address and I would imagine the letter itself should have had the agency that is claim your husbands wages will be garnished (or your husband could contact his work place and find out who the agency is that is taking his money).  You might call your State Child Support Agency and they might be able to help you out (or determine if it is some kind of scam).  Hell, maybe there is someone running a scam thinking you will call a number and say "Well if you pay <x> we won't require anymore money".  There HAS to be something that indicates this is legit..|`|quMUHyPsaa	I knew a man that received a letter from another state saying he owed child support to a kid in Alaska when he had never been to alaska.  Mistakes do happen.  I think you need to contact the child support agency or access court orders for the child support.  On the letter the case number should be there.  See the details and see why he is being charged with child support.  If your husband acted like he was surprised about the letter and was wanting to investigate it then he is probably innocent.  If he didn't say things like "what the hell is this, I'm going to call them and find out what's going on" then he is probably guilty as charged.|`|wpEoqEVXaa	A job won't and cannot simply garnish his wages. If a woman came to me and asked me to garnish the wages of my employee no matter what the reason, i could not legally do it. I'd get into big trouble and could even face going to jail and would be liable for a law suit. <br>  <br>  This means that a woman took your husband to court and won child support. OR... your husband signed the birth certificate and she went and got a court order to garnish his wages on his proof of paternity due to the signing of the birth certificate. <br>  <br>  If a man got a letter saying his wages were going to be garnished and he knew he hadn't had a child, he would be outraged and finding out who this person is and why it is happening. The easiest way to find this out is to go to the job and ask them for a copy of the court decree that tells them to garnish the wages. His employer would have to legally give him a copy of the decree, so don't buy into any lie saying the job wouldn't do it. Once he has the copy of the decree, he can see the court case number and go look it up at the court house that it was filed at. That would give him the name of the woman.<br>  <br>  But i would find it very hard to believe this would be the first he is hearing of it and doesn't know a thing about it. Doesn't seem feasible in any way, shape or form. I don't think you are delusional. <br>  <br>  If this is recent, you should be able to go to the court house and look it up. Court records are open to the public unless they've been sealed by a court. Even then, you can find the names, just not the content of the hearing. Sealed court rooms are very uncommon. <br>  <br>  If your husbands company is big enough, you could try calling human resources and ask them to fax you over a copy of the decree for the child support. Make it sound like you are asking for your husband and not yourself. You just might get away with it.best of luck there!|`|LxrsG8ifaa	It could be a mistake. My dad received a letter addressed to someone with the same first and last name, but the middle name was different. Actually, a police officer brought the papers to his house and was going to serve him with some type of warrant for non payment. It is actually possible this is a mistake. You or your husband should follow the paper trail. Start with HR at his job, ask who they recieved this notice from and get a copy of it. Good luck.|`|goY0JHzlaa	A paternity test should be able to confirm if he is the father or not. If he is......then you will other things to deal with. I would tell him he needs to take the test to prove he isn't the father. It would also be important because you wouldn't want him paying child support for a child that is not his. Would you?  Your husband really, really, needs to hire an attorney to help him in this matter.|`|Pltwn7D3aa	I think chances are the courts just didn't pick your husband randomly! Something is going on, odds are against you on this one, from my understanding a woman a has to go to court and give info on who she believes to be the father, name, address, ssn, phone etc then he is served. So  there may be a chance that he is not the father, but he cheated, no doubt about it.|`|xvey8ixPaa	He needs to contact child support services and ask these very same questions. He might need a lawyer himself, unfortunately. The thing is women say this stuff all the time to get money, but, I believe that the burden of proof is on her, and she would have to pay for the paternity tests. I would not be all up in arms over this yet. keep your cool. What is it is a mistake and they are after another man? This really might not be him. Have him call the numbers and find out how to go about all of it and keep calm. Then take things as they go. You can't go through this with a panic...you can't be any help if you do not stay calm.|`|y4w6ybr3aa	Don't freak out just yet. This may have been a clerical error or maybe this happened before he met you.<br>  I would go with him for the paternity test, if he really has no idea whats going on then he shouldn't have a problem with you going with him.<br>  Remember your his wife and you have a right to know.|`|NUSgnkdVaa	It might be public knowledge. you would have to go either the court house or the county clerks office. where ever the public records are kept.

I hope this helps.|`|7ach0Dz5aa	Well if someone is saying he owes child support and he says he has no kids he needs to take a paternity test. Also, how long have you 2 been together?

OeRzlZPnaa	I would continue to go out with him. I know a few guys that will have sex with girls right off the bat, but when thier truly interested they like to tone down the intimate touches and sex and wait so they can get to know the girl. That way the relationship isn't just about the physical aspects it's about the emotional too. He's probably just telling you that he wants to get to know you, and have a real relationship with you and not just a physical one.|`|9PbyjAEXaa	he probably feels like it is to rushed and afraid u feel the same way. he doesn't want to loose you be moving to fast so he suggested to take it slow. i think that is a good thing for him to say. so dont worry about it.|`|6iR7Mvc5aa	I'm sure you feel something for him too.

He sounds like he might be interested in having a relationship with you in the future and doesn't want it to be based on sexual attraction alone.  Perhaps he is concerned that things went too far too soon. Sounds like a winner to me.  I suggest you agree with him and tell him you are interested in getting to know him well too.  If you've been out 3 times there is obviously some interest on your part.  Don't blow it just because the guy isn't a hound.  The very least you can end up with is a great friend if you play your cards right.

How do you know he's not cheating on you?<br>  <br>  If you cant trust him not to go have intercourse with other girls then where is this relationship going? nowhere thats where.<br>  <br>  You should start dating other guys, sure alot will be jerks but there is good guys like me out there who will treat you well and give you complete trust and peace of mind.<br>  <br>  He can't even see how mucg stress this is putting you under.. what makes you think he will know how much hurt and pain you'll feel if he has a relationship with another girl?<br>  <br>  DO IT FOR YOURSELF! ITS YOUR FUTURE.|`|o8LX83jVaa	ha ha Minnisota, don't ya know? lol<br>  <br>  ok well i think that you should talk to him and kinda give him an ultimatum, like "if you don't stop lying to me and doing these sorts of things, then this relationship is going to end."<br>  <br>  if you don't want to do that, just kinda tell him how you feel and still explain why you feel that way and what you'll if he doesn't stop.<br>  <br>  hope this helps, eh? (and i'm not making fun of you, half my family is from up north)
KaF0nNFmaa	He sounds pretty depressed.  It doesn't really sound as if he is trying to hurt you directly, he just doesn't know what to do.  He really really needs to see a doctor.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	It's not abuse, but it's not a marriage either.  If you are unhappy, divorce him.|`|TPN1yIj7aa	he may just have a low sex drive. also, he may have other things on his mind. you also mention that he's tired from work. <br>  <br>  just try this, set up an eveningn alone with no interuptions, if you have kids arrange for a relative to take care of them. sort a lovely meal, time alone together, bottle of wine and have a chat with him. explain how you feel, what you want. some men really are thick and literally need things spelling out to them! it could be that you learn some things about him as well. conversation is a 2 way thing so be prepared to listen and talk.<br>  <br>  the fact that his ex cheated is irrelevant. he may be hurting over this. being cheated on can make someones self esteem hit the floor and not feel in the least bit sexy.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	It's not really abuse but it's clear that neither of you are happy.<br>  <br>  Think long about your relationship.  Can you see yourself like this for the next 40 years? Or can you put up with things for the sake of the children?  If not then change it.|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	I think it would depend on his reasons. If he has actively deceived you for years, and is sleeping with someone else, then it might be emotional abuse. In some states refusing sex can be included under mental cruelty as grounds, becuse the courts recognize sex as a biological need, like food and shelter. I had a husband who refused sex for many years and it turned out he was living a double life, had a woman in the philippines, and was gaslighting me, in preparation for his new life to get off the ground. He was a classic narcissist and a pathological liar. So in my case it was abuse. It might not be the case for your man. Only you can figure that out.<br>  If he is simply incapable of loving (himself, others,you), then you will be hard pressed to be content. Consider the option of living a full life with more choices available to you. You can't make 'em love you if they don't. Sucks, but you can survive and move on.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Before you leave him, demand the two of you go to relationship counselling.  If he refuses, then well, maybe it would be better off to end things. It can't be doing your kids any good to see mom and dad stomping around being mad at each other all the time. No matter how much you might try to hide it, they know.  <br>  <br>  If he says yes, then perhaps you have a chance at sorting things out.|`|8130732466e5c537088eddfef54bd90faa	If he is truly that tired, and has low sex drive, then no, that is not abuse.  If he is lying about it, who knows.  Sounds like you have the unfortunate  luck of being paired with someone who expects differently from life as you do.   Your choice as a married couple, are to either put up with it, or divorce.  Counseling may help, but no guarantee either.  Good Luck.|`|rp46MQKeaa	No it is not abuse just a lack of communication could he be suffering from depression?                             Get him to see his doctor and go with him.                                                                      You may need some marriage counselling If he does neither of these things he is being unreasonable and that give you grounds for divorce, this should only be your last option|`|quMUHyPsaa	Sounds to me like the marriage is over.  Your husband is not into you and your emotional needs will not be met there. Just know that you cannot make someone act the way you want them to.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Not abuse.  Complete lack of open communication and dialogue in the marriage.  Try some therapy...|`|0UUDFxR0aa	I have lived in this situation for 3 years myself.  We are now just roommates.  I hate it, but due to financial reasons we are still together.  So, good luck.|`|jBigEy0Caa	Stop being so immature and playing games.  You are only making things worse by trying to get even.  Talk to him and if that doesn't work seek counseling.|`|zuOqbkdEaa	try marriage counselling if not divorce him|`|TUNvbXbgaa	if you are so unhappy then divorce him. maybe he is gay and does not want to admit it.|`|3a74f8e968179db88a366eba81b6d2e0aa	He sounds like one of these unfortunate people who don't really care for sex, or there could be a physiological reason.  Whatever, it doesn't sound like he's interested in fixing it, and it sounds like he was pretty much the same in his last relationship.<br>  <br>  This isn't really abuse, but it's a miserable existence nonetheless.  Sell the house and take the kids, especially if he doesn't care.  "Taking two to tango" not only doesn't even apply here, but it's the worst excuse I ever heard.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	No, this is not a form of abuse. Your husband having a low sex drive, which can be caused by anything, is not abusing you in any way. He doesn't feel like having sex with you, and pressuring him isn't going to help. Suggest he go to the doc to make sure everything checks out, he may be depressed, or bored in the bedroom. Try a sex therapist if all else fails|`|4c0cf9f350fb671d47c31b8cd53823a6aa	You don't say what age you are but I assume you are young. Every girl/woman has the right to be made love to by her husband/partner. If this is not happening then I would suggest that the love is gone. You should consider moving on.|`|WypJADCuaa	No it isn't abuse... Sounds like you have been unhappy for a long time... If that unhappy then end it now and find happiness elsewhere|`|v4DfbDEQaa	not a form or phyiscal abuse but i think u need to find someone who will make you happy, no point being with someone if ur not happy u will just get depressed.|`|PbwCVPL1aa	Tell your husband to go see a Dr. or your leaving. Thats not a marriage.|`|ObZChw3paa	Cliffs?|`|031551eb799725ff135a73eee37b3162aa	If it is not a clinical/medical problem- (make sure it isn't) then he must have a psychological one. First discuss with him- why he has such a low sex drive. Be supportive at first- he may have depression. Be patient and discuss the situation with him over a few weeks. Is it you he does not fancy? No probs- you can get another partner- or is he bogged down with other worries that make sex the last thing on his mind. Both men and women suffer with lack of libido at times. It's not uncommon.Husbands pester you for sex or you pester them- if only we all wanted it at the same time! If you do not get any answers or any further- then be brave and leave him and get your happiness back for yourself and a sex life! with somebody that cares. However, you may find with discussion and a bit of humour you can get your sex life back again. Be independent and aloof and make the most of yourself- no doubt he will be knocking on your bedroom door again. Men are a different species at times.  Do not lose your self esteem, confidence or sex drive over this man , but  try to resolve this one more time before quitting completely by talking it over with a laugh.|`|K4ulbvUpaa	I have to say that this is not abuse, but an injustice to you!<br>  <br>  Sorry he is right but it takes 2 to tango, and i think a marriage can be worked out through any problems you may have, i say you should try once more, men are men and they feel showing any kind of emotion is showing weakness, if you feel it's worth it try once more, if that doesn't work then you should let it go, this way you will know in your heart you attempted to work it out before giving up.  <br>  <br>  Good luck honey and change is difficult but be strong and you will get through it!|`|k7SOs18raa	well if you are married the games of getting back at each other must end...leave that for high school kids...you are in a serious relationship now and you must take action...if you still in love with this man you need to seek counseling and try everything in the book to make this work...after all is a marriage not a one night stand...if everything fails and deep in your hear you know that you have tried everything to make it work and it still doesnt then you must move on..oh by the way this is not abuse
NqbBjS0raa	Well, they say experience comes from the many patients you get to diagnose and shows how many problems guys have in this generation. They need to TLC as much as the older patients who can't seem to learn from any history or heed any excellent advice unless you pound into their head.

Actually he should have considered that joke might freak you out. That was slightly douche-ish|`|441002ba222c31246fd283fc8f2694bfaa	Are you seriously going to let that get between you? you both err in your decisions, you by bitching about having to talk to him, and then by giving such a snappy comeback, and him by snubbing you all day. In all reality you definitely upset him by saying you called him enough in that email, because it makes it sound like you don't enjoy talking to him, and he basically tried to take back what he did by saying it was a joke.<br>  <br>  You both screwed up.<br>  <br>  Don't let something so petty turn into a big deal, both of you say sorry and get back to being in a relationship.|`|Ii5udGmJaa	uh yeah , thats his fault. He kept pulling your leg and being a " jerk " about it , as far as the communications go through e-mail ect , he probably was upset at you or something , but then relised that he was in the wrong and so he was just trying to cover it up by saying it was a joke and that you were over reacting. Besides what joke lasts 10 hours long ?<br>  seriously. He is in the wrong and he is probably just trying to cover something up by saying that it was a mere joke.<br>  <br>  well thats my 2 bits <br>  good luck with that<br>  hope it works out..|`|0Ee8r5KRaa	he is definatly, you can't joke around like that over email...<br>  <br>  cause you can't hear each other's voices.<br>  <br>  so at least he was kidding, and everything is good,<br>  <br>  so don't go fretting over it|`|AA10011751	I must say, it's neither fault.<br>  Don't make this small thing into something big because it is small.<br>  He said he was joking so leave it alone.|`|6eu0uzMNaa	well he is at fault cause he didnt say jk or haha lol but you also should of asked him before flipin off your rocker at him its good to ask questions if u dont understand thing just acting on thought always better to talk so you both are at fault he needed to say he was joking and u needed to ask if he was joking so in the future always ask instead of reacting|`|DAHBFQx6aa	Why would anybody be at fault? Guys do that stupid crap and feel like we're nuts cause we can't tell that they're kidding.. Well, sometimes they're really not kidding, they're confused about what they're feeling. But nobody is at fault.. and yea, he coulda said a lil more to let you know he was joking, if he was.|`|N5q1osbCaa	My boyfriend does that all the time. It seems like when girls are joking around it's something that would be jokingly but, when guys joke around it's the total opposite to joke around about. It sounds like he is most certainly at fault here. He could of just replied and told you the information you asked/messaged him for, he didn't need to be an *** about it. I would just let it go and move on though, this is nothing serious to get mad over. <br>  If he does it again just ignore him and see how he likes it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|ejSCd2Mkaa	I think looking at this information that it's not anyone's fault, it was just a big misunderstanding and in your defense he shouldn't have been so vague in his texts and he shouldn't have ignored you like it sounds like he did. That's just one person's opinion.
Ga7rI488aa	lol I'm pretty good at this under certain circumstances.<br>  If you know any of his friends, its best to start talking to them more, then eventually you'll be near him more often<br>  <br>  If you have a class with him, strike up conversation, ask for help, etc<br>  <br>  If you know what sports/clubs he's in ask "You're in (fill in the blank) right? How's that going, what do you do in that club, etc<br>  <br>  haha be confident too! it helps!|`|xOVizPWVaa	comment whatever he seems to work hardest on in his look hair clothes shoes. i dress a little diff not like a f*cken freak but not the norm and random girls giving me comments on my clothes especially shoes is nice he might be caught off guard but give it a shot he will obviously notice you make shure he sees you coming cause if hes talkin wit his bros he may not notice you which will be embarrassing for you maybe be with your friends which brings up your staus and be confident. i dont care how hot the girl is confidence helps a **** load and look him in his eyes before you start talking to establish a connection then hold it if he says nothing leave it at that and walk away wait a little while then re post a question this is gonna be the first step.|`|6oZcHIjiaa	Sometimes its fun being all out of the blue.

36i2kZ6Caa	I think that he likes you but he's just too shy to tell you his feelings.<br>  <br>  :)
aAUeWJ5laa	I'm definitely for it. It helps people who are too shy to get out there. It's also cool how you can find people that have the same interests as you instead of just guessing, you know? Besides, once you meet them, it's exactly like meeting a stranger in any other situation. :) You just have to be careful!|`|ACNECiZAaa	Well because I met one of my best friends online I'm somewhat biased in this area. I agree though, if you have enough proof the person is who they say they are then there's no harm in meeting them in a SAFE location. I personally have met this wonderful guy online who lives a few hours north of me, we've recently started dating online and so far things are great. No plans to meet in the near future, but I'm happy to have found him. So I'm for meeting singles online, it gives you a chance to meet different people and get to truly know them. Like they say, 9 months of online dating is equivalent to 3 years of dating someone you see every other day.
AXgEyWTpaa	What jerks!|`|oojO4WAraa	I am sorry for your loss.<br>  <br>  I'd be upset.  That isn't a good kind of help.  <br>  <br>  By "broke down" - do you mean a complete emotional breakdown that required hospitalization, or do you mean you cried and grieved?   <br>  <br>  Unless you had a complete emotional breakdown at your uncles funeral, I think you should have been told about your grandma's death and funeral.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	One never knows what they were thinking. However, the fact that you said you had a very difficult time at your uncles funeral is a indication that yes; they were trying to spare your feelings. I would simply ask them. And then explain your feelings. However, keep in mind that they really probably thought they were acting in your best interest.|`|djUMvICoaa	They were helping... themselves.  They were embarassed by how you reacted at your uncles funeral, they didn't know how to support you.  It was wrong for them to exclude you because of their feelings.  I think you come from a family that isn't very tight knit and friendly.  They are the ones who when someone needs a hug and a good word don't know how to do it or what to say.  They take it like men, without tears.  They are also partly dead inside, they can't connect with all of their feellings.  Have you gone to the graveside and had a little chat with your grandmother?  I would and tell her how you feel and you can get your good byes in that way.  It can sometimes be nicer, you have her all to yourself and for as long as you want.  good luck|`|DooJ5iDGaa	I don't think being mad at your family is the answer .. Best thing is to talk to them and demand an explanation. A funeral is made to say goodbye to those loved , and missed ones  Since the funeral already happened I would consider a small reunion and say the proper goodbye if that is what you want, but holding onto anger towards family is never an answer. Nothing good ever comes from that.|`|N3gZO3Ajaa	You should'nt be mad at them|`|bGyVJ6meaa	I'd be mad, you have the right to know and the right to say goodbye.<br>  <br>  However, speak to your family, let them know how you feel, they may have made a mistake, but they are human so do not hold it against them, they may have made a bad decision because they too are going through a terrible time<br>  <br>  The last thing you want to do is have such a sad time as the basis for arguenments.|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	I don't care how you reacted to your Uncle's death.  Your reaction wasn't abnormal, it was normal.  You should have been told and your family was WRONG by not telling you and that's not normal and it doesn't matter how you would have reacted.  If your okay with not going to your grandmothers funeral, then of course its okay! If your not okay with missing your grandmothers funeral, then its not okay!|`|3BKjpr29aa	I think that your family were trying to help but everyone has the right to go to their families funeral and i would  certainly be mad in your case.|`|d4DYyAd6aa	it may be anything ,it is bad on  ur family part that they didn't inform you that ur grandma has passed away...it is a must that u should be at the funeral..

nv7Cofm5aa	You really shouldn't stereotype on the basis of what you think of African American men and women. Attraction is subjective and if you let something like this bother you because you feel unattractive, yourself, then it will usually becomes an obstacle for you to deal with. <br>  <br>  It's all in your head. The key is to remember that attraction is different for everyone and each individual has different taste in what they find attractive or not. <br>  <br>  For example, I'm Asian American. Throughout my high school years, I dated Asian American girls. Now that I'm much older and graduated high school and college.... I find Caucasian American women very attractive. I think the reason for this shift or change is because of my geographical surroundings. It really has to do with demographics and how long you have been in one area. Basically, I've been living in the US for too long. <br>  <br>  And you know what I tell myself now? I say, Asian American women aren't hot at all! Caucasian and African and Latina women are on my list... but I usually prefer Caucasian women and have met a few. My gosh... they are downright hot and gorgeous! Asian women don't compare but that is my opinion on this subject. And everyone else may not agree.<br>  <br>  Again, it's different for each individual. I have been successful meeting Caucasian women and I never felt so good in my life. Yippee kai yah baby! Ok, now where did that blonde or brunette girl go?|`|MW1yrHbOaa	idk, i am black and i ask myself that all the time, i am not racist or anything, (most of my friends are white, my best friend is puerto rican) usually the black men that i see or even know have a trashy looking white girl they don't go for the pretty ones. From what my ex told me is that white women don 't have attitudes that black women have and he can get more stuff out of her than me and get away with more things. IDK!!!|`|mYhuGonfaa	I don't think "they" do. It all comes down to personal preference. I'm white and marrying a black man, in his case, he is actually African (not African-american), and he's a bit stereotypical of black girls, he prefers a laid back woman and someone who isn't demanding and dominant (basically he hasn't met a black woman that fits the personality type he likes in a woman). I can only speak for him, I don't know why other black men choose to date outside of their race. I applaud any person for going outside the norm and finding what THEY like, rather than dating someone because it's what's expected.|`|qM9tSVd8aa	please i love my black girls no i love black women hey latinas and white girls are cute but black women do it best im just saying i get so tired of the stereotype that black women are loud thats not true all the black women i been around are nice calm women and educated. girl just keep your head up|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	Perhaps you frequent diversely populated areas when you go out so you run into more diverse couples.  What's the big deal?  I'd much rather people practice their preferences than stick to dating people within their race because they don't want to offend others.|`|NgawN7Pcaa	iuno.|`|OeRzlZPnaa	I've had a couple black guys tell me that they prefer latinas or white girls cause alot of the black girls that they've been with tend to be stronger women who don't give you alot of leeway, and if when they mess up they KNOW.

But if your asking why is it more common to see black guys with non-black girls than it is to see black girls with non-black guys then I think it has something to do with the black mans ability to branch out and explore new experiences without feeling afraid or like he's comprising or settling by doing this. Black women are not as open to interracial romance.|`|lSq1LJUtaa	Its like asking why white, or hispanic women choose to date more black men.  It doesn't matter.  Go out and find someone who makes you happy.  I like to see it as, maybe people aren't  just looking skin deep.

uij93NOjaa	Maybe you can add a little color to the decorations you want! Like the balloons or little things like that.......... Maybe even the bowls and plates you put the appetizers on.....I'm thinking a yellow?  <br>  I had a very formal wedding but my reception was a blast!! My younger cousins said it was a lot more fun  than disney land, haha!!  I will honestly say that color doesn't matter if you want your reception to be fun or not. If the guests see that you are relaxing and having a blast too they will be right behind you! Make sure you have a DJ that will play everything you want too!!  <br>  Also, it helps if you try and get what the songs the "sitters" like so that they will start moving as well. One song that really gets people in the mood is " Shout", by The Isley Brothers. Good luck and I hope it ends up being a blast!!!|`|mvKDbb2uaa	There are tons of ways to do that.<br>  <br>  I had a formal ceremony too, but the reception was laid-back and tons of fun.  A lot of it really has to do with you two as a couple.  We complimented our colors with brighter ones--we used cornflower dresses from DB but for the reception we chose to go with more summery mixes of colors like hot pinks, whites, yellows, blues and purples all put together to make it lively.  We hung out with the guests for cocktail hour and mingled and danced the whole night.  In reality, the feel and tone of it is really set by you.  Since my husband and I are both laid-back, we wanted a laid-back reception and that's what we got.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I think something like magenta would go well with your colors and add some fun to the look.|`|bf6K6uubaa	what about that mermaid blue they have..if you have two shades of blue that compliment each other it makes it more "fun" rather than just the two toned black and blue formal|`|0VFKldieaa	add a bright yellow or white to the reception colors.<br>  also the music can set the tone.. if you are playing classical music you're likely to have a formal reception but if you bust out the "fun music" you'll be fine people will dance and it will be fun.<br>  also, funky fun centerpieces could add to the mood you're looking for.<br>  picture this :<a href="http://www.perfect-wedding-day.com/image-files/wedding-reception-ideas-3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.perfect-wedding-day.com/image...</a><br>  with some really great centerpieces & dancin' music and you have yourself a fun reception.<br>  <br>  example:<br>  <a href="http://dlsweddingplanner.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/tuterafrenchinspired.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://dlsweddingplanner.files.wordpress...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="https://www.glamourousgowns.co.uk/blueyellowmood.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://www.glamourousgowns.co.uk/blueye...</a><br>  <br>  AND you can't forget the funky/fun cake!!<br>  <a href="http://budgetdreams.files.wordpress.com/2006/06/blue0topsyturvy.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://budgetdreams.files.wordpress.com/...</a><br>  <br>  happy wedding hope i helped.|`|CkN4pgpCaa	I don't think that you have to have anyone alter their clothes to make the reception fun... just make your bridal party aware that the reception is not as formal and you want them to have fun!  I'm putting a couple of my bridemaids in charge of keeping people on the dance floor at the reception.. and I've asked the DJ to stick to fun dance music! <br>  <br>  People will follow the tone of the bridal party at the reception.  If they are all up and mingling and dancing after the meal, then other people will as well.  <br>  <br>  If you still want to add some color to the bridal party's clothes, just have your bridesmaids wear a colorful purse or change shoes... you can do the same.  Or they can literally let down their hair.  I can't see the guys being very receptive to adding more clothes... they usually can't wait to take off the jacket and loosen the tie at the reception!<br>  <br>  Edit: Okay- in that case, I like magenta or fuschia with that color blue and silver!

ZDC81VjZaa	He's eleven, good grief!!  He's probably experiencing his first erections and right now... EVERYTHING feels good.  He's eleven.  If he's sexually active, literally...  slap your parents for me and tell them to pay attention.  If that's NOT the case... leave him alone.  He's eleven... what does he know about his sexuality except that all of this is new to him and he's just trying to figure it out.  <br>  <br>  It shouldn't matter that he sleeps in his birthday suit... it DOES disturb me a little that YOU know this.  So he's comfortable in his own skin... kudos to him since that seems to be so challenging for quite a few others in this world.<br>  <br>  He talks to girls, reacts to girls, goes out with girls... there isn't enough information provided as to how you came to the conclusion he wants to have sex with guys.  <br>  <br>  One more thing... he's your BROTHER.  Why should it make a difference if he WAS gay, after all?  If it were to shame you to discover he were... then you've much to learn about unconditional love for another.<br>  <br>  He's eleven.  Leave him alone.  It's not like he's doing it all right in front of you.

HsvBInbRaa	Im open enough with my husband that I can tell my husband anything. Maybe you need to work on your marriage so you can be open with him|`|ephBKMthaa	He could stink because he isn't showering often enough it's true.  OR it could be his body reacts badly to all the perfumes that are put in our body soaps, detergents, deodorants and colognes.<br>  <br>  Try putting some plain old ordinary soap in the shower, try Ivory and get unscented deodorants and unscented laundry detergent - maybe that will help.<br>  <br>  Have an honest discussion with him, perhaps before you were married he used unscented products.  Together you can figure this out, but you need to talk about it - without hurting his feeling would be the best way.  It's not your comforter, its both of yours isn't it?  He probably doesn't' like the smell either.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|wsxMUdYZaa	Honey, if you dont want to tell him, just take a shower with him in the morning - saves water and he will smell nice throughout the day. And when he gets back from work, just wait for him with a warm bubble bath with scented candles - he can relax in the water in your arms. I am sure that would make your relationship better and solve the problem too :)|`|Ob94lxJUaa	Wow the thing here is honesty if he never smelt like that when you first met him then you as a wife should sit him down and tell him.If the shoe was on the other foot would you want him to hold back the truth and talk behind your back.No that is not love or being fair!!|`|dSMb8JDvaa	Just tell him, he would be appreciate you rather than some one else told him. He is your husband so help him get rid of STINKs, I bet to get rid of Odor is easier than snoring.....so tell him!|`|kprKXEOSaa	You need to help him find out what is causing the odor.  Is he dehydrated?  Does he have a foot fungus?  If it isn't just a matter of hygiene, he may have some kind of a medical issue that could be remedied.<br>  As an example, my husband's pillow has smelled bad for years, and I just thought he had a particularly oily head.  Recently, I started buying him a different shampoo, and he's not so greasy and his pillow doesn't smell.  It could be something as simple as that.  Find out what is causing the odor, then you can help him remedy it.<br>  Good luck!|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	if he smells it means he is not bathing as often as he should. soap won't help if he isn't washing the important parts.|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	The only way he could possibly have that kind of odor would be that he does not have good body hygeine. Anyone that doesn't shower daily, has a odor. Just come right out and tell him and if he don't understand, I'd make my bedroom somewhere else.

YfxZbLueaa	Sometimes friends try too hard to push things on you that they think are right.  You should ask yourself if you and your cousin were close prior to the incident. If so it may be your friends naiive way of trying to push the two of you back together.  It's so easy to think that "oh this person is just a jerk" but if you truly believe that this person is you friend then you must also believe that she would never intentionally do something to hurt you so there must be some other motive for her actions.  hope i helped|`|OB1fa0vjaa	You have to open your eyes.

Maybe she forgets about that.  You can't forget it but I bet she does.  I'd remind her of the history of that person with you and tell her it bothers you to be around her and to please consider how you feel.  Some people are just blind to those things and you have to spell it out for them. But if she realizes it makes you uncomfortable and she still does it then you need to get her out of your life completely because you don't need anyone in your life that isn't considerate of your feelings.|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	Because they aren't truly your friend

I cussed his @zz out, and scared him telling him about how his judgement day and afterlife will be like because he cheated how disgusting he was and how he would reap what he sowed. i gave the cell phone to his mom too and she went off on him when he got out. i think you should record him trying to strip or something, but do it when he isnt in full erection. then post it online and in web chats and back to his web cam and let everyone know and him that you are dumping a cheater with a limp noodle hee hee|`|aWSX4zPtaa	Be the girl on the webcam?<br>  When the time is right, tell him it's over.|`|vfcD8Ic1aa	break up with him!!!|`|pVnUhYLQaa	Create a fake profile in whatever service he's using to chat.

If you were best friends then there should be some maturity to help that along. He could also be confused and not know what to say, though i think its the latter. He doesnt hate you i think hes just trying to see how much you care, see how to get to you....and its working because your worried about why he wont forgive you. Sweet heart i dont think there is anything he needs to forgive. Your being mature and hes not. Id say if you really want to know then approach him, if he wont talk to you like an adult then walk away.

No matter what get out of your misery.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	You need to start going through the receipts, every week. Every week one of you pays, then the other person works out exactly how much they owe and then pays the other person their share. Money shouldn't be an issue you fight about, and there is no reason why you cant openly work it out each week. My boyfriend and I always do, if one of us bought something particularly personal and expensive, then we make sure we take that amount off. If my boyfriend buys a lot of things that I don't want, then we just take that off, no problem. If she has any issues with this then she is being a moocher.|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	wow poor u..<br>  well u need to say it to her some way or another.<br>  Just tell her the truth right..<br>  tell her that "u never actually like shopping with anyone, u don't want to hurt her feelings one day so u r telling her this now she can know the truth, then mention something else u like to do alone."<br>  or u will have to tell her the truth, how she buys more things and u end up paying for it,and not getting a chance to even eat from it,so it'll be better if u both went shopping alone..<br>  <br>  she has to understand..<br>  <br>  Good luck

F3KkB4GWaa	Girls just wanna have fun. =) Your not a ho everyone has their wild moments.|`|Kd3GRiLyaa	its not even bad to hookup with some one. kids do it all the time and so what what your friends thought. they were probably mad because you hooked up with an attractive guy and they didnt. its not like you ****** him so dont trip:)|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	I think women will kiss over 100 or more guys before they get married on average.  Nothing wrong with that.  IF you have sex with that many then you are a hoe.|`|ahujYDBdaa	LOL..Idaho...I da hoe. how ironic.|`|1611a17a4b0cd6610c45b73de16234bcaa	why not just keep in touch since you have his number....<br>  <br>  he is hot as well...so why not keep in touch...who knows when is the next time you'll see him....|`|krIKhZzcaa	Well don't listen to your friends that called you a hoe. But also it was kinda a hoe..ish to act like that with a guy you odn't even know & someone you may not ever see again. Ever heard of a one night stand? That's not exactly what you're going through but if it was more then just a make out then it could be considered that. Well maybe something will happen ;)<br>  <br>  Hope it helps :)|`|aAUeWJ5laa	I wouldn't ever do that. Probably because I haven't had my first kiss yet and I still think of it as something really special.<br>  <br>  I'm going to put the light back on you though. I think what you did was okay if you were comfortable with it. The people who called you a hoe are just jealous or have a different outlook. You have to do what feels right to you in life!|`|kNdPHdayaa	well dear i'll just say its is aliyahs<br>   not so that a hot man isGUDA good human being too <br>  u must go for a guy who is gud looking and gud person too<br>  <br>  and for the kiss i must say u must control urslef as it could led to somthing else too and u will lose he will lose nothing|`|wGKBuipYaa	IT happens thousands of times a day in bars all over the world.

It could happen in soap drama only. way cool!|`|UsJDUm1Haa	i guess if u wanted to do it ok. but you have to be careful. he could have had herpes or something on his mouth or in. so just be careful who you makeout with.

BbRewQjQaa	Yeah it is called a fantasy.|`|nLeJJ5nMaa	lb smooth|`|vj2pWs9Maa	Actually, I have.  I met this guy on internet dating who lived about 7 hours away from me.  He felt the "connection" too.  We emailed and talked all the time, finally it was time to meet and things just weren't right.  He was an idiot.  I'm glad I had the chance to meet him though and confirm one way or the other.|`|r8CmwwNiaa	ya...............funny that that person thought I was crazy =p. When you feel something for somebody, your unconscious usually knows something about that person that you might not know right off the bat................hell even that sounds crazy|`|rMq9D06Faa	a couple times but I was wrong...<br>  <br>  I hope some time that we will click in person (or, in most cases, I wish we would actually meet)|`|jUKEqDmwaa	crazy
D7KwEaoXaa	She might be a little intimidated of it :)<br>  You said she is inexperienced, so maybe she's nervous that she isn't meeting your expectations.<br>  <br>  Try boosting her confidence a little bit. Tell her you'd like to try something you've never done before, but you're worried you'll look like an idiot doing it. (Make it something simple, like sitting up on the couch, or in the car, or on the floor, nothing technical that might make her feel novice). This way, you both are doing something new, and are on equal inexperience.<br>  <br>  While you are doing the deed, talk to her once in a while. Laugh and say you have no idea what you're doing and ask her if she thinks you're doing OK? Ask her if she likes this, or if she thinks it's weird. Ask her if she's willing to try it once or twice more to see if you guys get more comfortable with it. Ask her if there's anything she'd like to try next time.<br>  <br>  and... well, maybe you are a little dominant in the bedroom? Maybe it's her personality to be more dominant and she doesn't know it? Maybe it's not as fun as she's expected it to be? I'm shy and quiet, but pretty dominant in bed.<br>  <br>  Lastly... Let it be natural. Don't ask for sex, offer to rub her neck, her back, start tickling her, wrestle with her. Whatever fun things you can do that might just naturally turn into sex. Ask her if you could have a night where you do everything but have sex. Foreplay only. The contest is to see how crazy you can drive your partner. Maybe finish the night with some oral satisfaction.|`|GrCj35muaa	boost her confidence, make her feel attractive. You need to learn how to really seduce a woman, don't just ask her if you can have sex tonight, turn her on, tease her, make it all about her, make her want and need your sex. just start with kissing her really gently on her neck. be very very gentle!!! every touch make it so soft its a tickle, touch near but not on her cooch. the more you do that, the more you will turn her on. soft kisses and a gentle touch, if that doesn't work you may be dating an in the closet lesbian... good luck
ahujYDBdaa	You ask her if she feels the same way, and if she does, you make it work this time.
D7KwEaoXaa	It sounds as if you are more likely to be interested in someone if they like you. You should be interested in someone because you like them, not because they like you.<br>  <br>  I was in a similar situation, but mine was quite easy to figure out. I loved a guy who was not interested in me at all. Two other guys loved me, but I was not interested in them at all. One of those guys turned out was a total creep, so it's good I stayed away from him. He sabotaged any chance I had with the guy I liked too. The other guy was super nice, and we could have made great friends except he was always crushing on me instead of acting normal. So we couldn't really be friends because he made it too awkward.<br>  <br>  Basically, everyone didn't get their way lol.|`|2edf122eba2505771c7555a9a3b1ff3daa	I have had this similar problem, but not with two boys at once. I've learned that it's best not to have boy friends, when you have a boyfriend.|`|l2eztZh5aa	i think you should approach the guy you like. and just let the two guys that like you right now like you, i have been through the same thing, about 3 times, it will always end up okay. if you do what you feel is right inside your heart.<br>  <br>  mine? please?:D<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgIF6dKbvccB5zJ0L2YZXKrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222223213AAc7SEe">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
iGN0o5sKaa	why aren't you two seeing each other lately? you should talk about it with your boyfriend so that you two can have some sort of plan for the both you of you to be together without having to disregard other aspects of your lives (family, friends, school, work). this isn't really something you should be worried about specially if you two are really in love with each other, right? lol|`|BEy22O6jaa	why don't you see each other? distance?|`|cllt4Alraa	makes more plans together. it would help knowing how old you both were too.|`|2459c53a947c522e7c160ec150f8c8adaa	No. If you were BOTH in love you would be seeing each other more often. Its one sided. You are in love with him more than he is in with you. Just keep cool and chill and be patient and see how things go. :o)|`|FShuTadYaa	Get him to spend more time with you. Maybe you can both do things that the other is interested in? btw definitely not a good thing to be with each other allll the time.|`|rnrJnqicaa	i dont know what you day is planned out as but try to spend as much time together as you can. this just happened to me and my boyfriend moved in with me!|`|3Ry2iuGBaa	Be with him all the time.<br>  It'll wear down faster that way,  lol
5VHWy0Ggaa	well to make him communicate, you should start by communicating! you need to let him know how you feel otherwise the realationship really isn't going to go in any direction... i would just call him up and tell him how you're feeling. just because you talk to him about what is going on, doesn't make you clingy.|`|za9b8cHKaa	Accept that it is over and move on ...|`|QlUNyK4Paa	call him,<br>  and be like hey you said you wuld call..<br>  then maybe he will start calling you.|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	If you dont want to end your relationship, keep in touch with him alot! like call him IM him. do stuff in that nature|`|4f51ca5e733afd3aff18667f295ba3c6aa	Sometimes ladies need to be the aggressor in situations like this. But not too wild though...give him the signals for him to go for you too|`|6mqA4uKbaa	I think it's because you don't have much common life, so to speak. Partners should spend as much time as possible (but not too much) to strengthen their connections.|`|OadMCKfgaa	Sounds to me like your man is cheating on you, sorry if you think he isn't.  No offense, but guys that love their girls don't forget to call, and they would usually want to 'communicate' with their girls whenever they get to see them.  Long-distance relationships are not for the weak.  But then again, you state that your relationship was never official.<br>  Confront him.  Ask him what's been up.  Don't post lame questions like this, because usually you should go with your gut feeling.|`|yPvqLD6zaa	geez, lol yeah they may be for fun but i just cant shake it off that most of what they say seem to be true, why dont u try read about yourself and about "him" and then see if they'l real or not, forreals, try it<br>  <br>  and since im so nice i'l give u these sites and the pw <br>  <a href="http://www.numerologist.com/members/" rel="nofollow">http://www.numerologist.com/members/</a><br>  <br>  enter the pw "destiny"<br>  <br>  go down to the 2rd free software program on the near bottom of the list, just waste some minutes n read up on it,, kk i gotta go bye|`|6ZFoujUGaa	agree with above... you should start the communication... call him..
2edf122eba2505771c7555a9a3b1ff3daa	I don't understand your details, but I think love is great when it's set right.|`|X39HuK6Vaa	love is an unpredictable feeling. it just pops out of the blue. If i were you don't be afraid to admit you're feelings because you have the right to love. but don't be to forward, make friends with him first, good luck girl.|`|3WfNL41yaa	When you love someone, you can't wait to tell them. True love never ends, in relationships we fall in and out of love. Real love will last forever, ask yourself these questions to see if you're really in love with the person.<br>  Would you still love them if they break you're heart?<br>  Would you still love them if they lost their memory and didn't know who you were?<br>  Would you still love them if they changed dramatically in regards to their looks? gained or lost weight etc.<br>  If you know you deeply love the person then go for it, tell the world life's too short not to.<br>  If you get rejected again life's short and they're someone out there that would love to have someone like you in there life.|`|n7EKxeLvaa	LOVE is god s greatest creation. Love brings out the best in humans and can be expressed in countless ways. Love can be complicated and it can also be most innocent.I live for LOVE|`|pMn2A7l8aa	Love Is A Scary Thing For Everyone But If You Honestly Believe Youu Love Someone I Always Say Too Go For It Instead Of Denying It Too Yourself :)

2pxGPcxaaa	Here are some signs:<br>  <br>  - You have no desire for anyone else<br>  - You find yourself changing your style, manner, values for his affection<br>  - You're obsessed, he becomes the center of your universe<br>  - You feel energetic, hyperactive and crazy in love<br>  - You're suddenly shy around him. You feel flushed, awkward, timid, and have "butterflies in the stomach"|`|VlTyziH7aa	You just know. Trust me, you'll know :)
iMGeSGdcaa	you are way too different, but you are SO not the type he will take home to meet mom and dad.|`|KncPJwIaaa	They do my relationship is all the way opposite and it works and believe me it will work for you both|`|DTN6Vg8caa	being different and sumthing new to offer does have its perk so long as u can enjoy each others company . do u feel comfortable wen he talks medical wid u do u respond to his ideals can u communicate wid him on those subjects even if only on lay man well<br>  does he also do it<br>  <br>  if yes<br>  then go for it|`|ZRbTdQ6iaa	Yes they do, but I'm not sure if it would work between you two..i guess it could work though|`|z0wy76Ewaa	no, not really....i just learned about this last week in my psychology class|`|Ys8t1CFkaa	why don't you try it out and see it for yourself|`|55Xq3a5Laa	It might work, I mean I've been attracted to girls very opposite of myself. Actually I think I'm more attracted to opposite than similar girls lol.|`|3TMr2TMDaa	Yes; and LIKES also attract too|`|CcffGmqTaa	the opposites attract thing only works in chemistry not in relationships.|`|YkBb5y98aa	think as long as you guys have fun and make each other laugh, than it can work. You do not need to be exactly alike but you need some things in common|`|uxeWIEPFaa	AS FRIENDS YES<br>  AS BF/GF NO
P4gH14lgaa	It depends on the person,i personly am just like you, i believe its my life to live, they've had theirs and its not up to them how i live my life or what i do, but in all reality they are still your parents and if you dont want them to run your life that ok, just fine, but you still need to respect them,because one day they will be gone and you will miss them :( just try to show them you care, im sure they understand when you dont wanna do what they want you to do :)|`|ZmikGFTEaa	Mm.. yea one ought to have his/her freedom in life but there is a point in life at times when you need someone to suggest you if what you are doing is really what you're supposed to do or not..<br>  thats when your parents come in and at times their opinion matters a lot as they are experienced people..<br>  not that they should rule over you or make you do anything but their suggestions and opinions should also matter to some extent..|`|sg93GVSJaa	Even the people who do not adore their parents will let their parent's opinions impact them.  Even if they don't do what the parent desires, there will always be that voice in the back of their head questioning them, taking their parents side.|`|8gUt623caa	Well I can honestly say that my father's my best friend.<br>  <br>  He wants me to attend Syracuse so that I'll be within a reasonable distance from him. I'm obviously looking but it doesn't stop me from checking out other schools, ya know? <br>  <br>  If they really care they'd never be upset with a final decision of yours for too long.|`|djUMvICoaa	I think we all value our parents opinion.  We have grown up looking for ways to please them.  We like it when they find pleasure in what we do.   And for the most part, our parents usually have our best interests at heart, but that doesn't mean they know what is in our best interest.  Just because they like doing something or wanted to do something doesn't mean we should feel or do that.  We do have to become our own person.  I found out myself how my father didn't want me writing articles but yet I think in his own way he was proud that I put things together good enough to make sense of what others passed over.  Was it worth it?  I feel it was necessary to be true to myself, but I also quit sharing what I was doing, that became his loss.  I don't think you can go wrong as long as it's right for you.  The other thing is that if they are upset by it I'm sure there are other issues that they having otherwise why would they stand in the way of your happiness.  I know my dad did.|`|xk845oILaa	thats exactly wat i am doing....studyin to please my parents..my parent's opinion is of highest importance...its the purpose of my life to satisfy my parents...if i cant do that for whatever reason, ill try and kill myself...and i am serious..|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	I am a grown woman, I would listen and perhaps even consider their ideas, however, ultimately will make my own choice. I will not do things simply to please my parents.|`|svYiQZUHaa	I value you my parents.
JAGWgic2aa	absolutely... and usually when you least expect it.|`|RsUEC74qaa	yeah|`|AA10657622	OF COZ :D|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Yes but it seems like when you are looking for it, it doesn't happen. When you least expect it you will find someone.
5DP859Gxaa	I would say yes. My husband and I are completely opposite, But we are each others "other Half" so to say. We have a handfull of things that we both like and can agree on|`|ibFTUi1taa	To a certain degree, yes. But if you have nothing in common then you have no common ground, ya know? <br>  I know when it comes to me and my boyfriend we are opposites in many different area's. He is more logical, and I am more emotional. He has taught me to not be so sensitive and look things in a different way, and I have taught him how to be a bit more sensitive. We have learned to balance the other out.|`|gQe01CHCaa	Not always. Sometimes they are so opposite that things could never work. You love someone because of who they are, but there are some things that your personality cannot conceive of. They have to have something in common.  At least one thing.|`|gywXHuGCaa	yes! example:<br>  one sleeps with two pillows, the sleeps with none, the exact opposite, but it fits lol|`|3gTwqGWdaa	opposites can attract, but what i have found out is that people with similar interests are more attracted to each other as you can see yourself in that person!|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Sometimes, yes. But generally, it's a chemistry/lust thing. Not something that will turn into a long lasting relationship.  You need some sort of similar interests and similar opinions to be able to make a long term relationship work.|`|aWSX4zPtaa	Not all the time, but yes they do.|`|F4kFUxd1aa	Opposites do attract. Some people like people who are totally different to them because it adds some kind of joy and excitement into their lives. If opposites did not attract, I think our lives would be so boring and there would be more divorces :)|`|mVMk80oeaa	It happens. I think it's got something to do with 'finding-your-other-half' thing. Making you feel complete?|`|rlF3PM5Saa	well the opposite of a boy is a girl.....|`|w6dXWoPzaa	dah
hgaNxhoaaa	Sometimes the people who seem to open up to everyone else really aren't opening up like you think they are...they're just trying to get attention by acting like they're opening up to people. Chances are she would open up to you more if you didn't seem to care so much. It seems like you give a lot in this relationship and don't get much in return that you seem to need in a friendship. She tells you you're important, but seems to put others ahead of you. Basically, you're dependable and she knows she can treat you however she wants and you're always going to be there for her, so she doesn't feel the need to invest in the friendship. I'd stop calling or hanging out with her for a few weeks and see where the friendshio goes. If she stops talking to you, you know she wasn't really your friend in the first place. These kinds of people are toxic and it's good to get them out of your life early. If she seems to care, let her know you're going to need more out of the friendship if she wants to remain your friend.|`|SNC58uQvaa	Your friend sounds like me. I struggle with an eating disorder. When my eating disorder flares up I with draw.<br>  <br>  One good thing is that your friend sees a counselor. That is most definitely a step in the right direction.<br>  <br>  I have a bunch of guys that chase me as well. I have some standing marriage proposals.<br>  <br>  I seem to counsel the world as well.<br>  <br>  Your friend battles codependency.<br>  <br>  YOur friend is so lucky to have someone as wonderful as you to care about her. I have female friends but I do a lot more for them, than any of them would ever do for me.<br>  <br>  I am all about giving and sharing and caring. I can tell by your post that you are a very caring person as well.<br>  <br>  I would say that it is time to back off from her, and explore the possibility of developing friendships with other people.<br>  <br>  You are young and you need to be care free and enjoy your life to the fullest. Spring and Summer are coming up and you will have the opportunity to really have fun.<br>  <br>  Hugs To You.|`|RDz4LmHDaa	if you are her best friend have some patience.<br>  of course you understand that we all go through things and we need time to heal.<br>  just be there for her|`|AL4Q6Agraa	You can't exatcly force her to open up to you, If thats not what she's comfortable with. If you push her too much, it may look like you're being a little pushy and selfish (because you just want to know), so take it easy.You have to however let her her know that you are their for her, just tell her how you feel.<br>  At least she is opening up to someone, getting help from somewhere..even if it's not you, at least she is getting the help. You have to try and be their for her for everything, if she has lost trust on you once before, it's also likely that maybe thats why, she is not as comfortable with talking to you about it. She also may feel that by talking about her own problems, she will be taking them onto you. <br>  So i suggest that you just tell her, that you wish she opened up to you more, and that you will be there for her. Apart from that, just take it easy, be her freind and be casual or like you always are around each other.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps :)
OOwUlO4Jaa	You are a great woman, yes personality is by far the sexiest, did you know that the greatest sexual organ is the brain, the brain is also where you find your personality, so it is personality for me any day of the week and twice on a sunday. lets suppose that you were dating a really fit bloke, (unlike me) you got married and he had some horrific accident, left him dis figured, would you go and get a divorce cos of his looks...no you wouldn't.<br>  <br>  to be a real person is to shine from within, cosmetics are sold by making people think they are no good without them, they are worthless until they plaster themselves with whatever product they are buying. we all know this is trash yet we all go out and get them, (not me though,I cant find a good lipstick to go with my work boots..lol)|`|bfd7416d5c182b4368126038daa8026faa	no ur nt im the same way and its good to think like that cuz in the furture ur going to want a guy who is smart and will be a more than great role model for ur kids and ur going to want sombody to be able to teach u new things and show u things that u never seen b4|`|f79c26b7044dd5c4e629f481f9756330aa	plenty ppl like that hun <br>  keep it up|`|rJxpXs35aa	oh no you are not the only one that feels that way i have met a few ladies like that.it just means you have great morals and you know beauty is in the eye of the beholder|`|e488c78b0404e0d573309d30166d7451aa	Okay, okay all that sounds so perfect and correct... wow, your parents must be happy with you... <br>  The only thing missing here is that you are (of course) a perfect student and that you know (of course) to cook and clean and all these typical household chores. <br>  What a perfect girl!! <br>  I don′t know why you think you should and will receive a medal for being so perfect... Guess what? When you finally realize that by trying to be the perfect Miss Perfect you missed a lot of fun and then it will be too late... getting married as a virgin??? I hope you are not expecting that the man you will get married to thinks the same and "saves his virginity for you"... But as you say, you prefer the ugly ones... so maybe you can marry one who never had a girl friend before...<br>  All you say sounds stupid for me, sorry...|`|sMZ6eel2aa	well, i'm pretty 'old-fashioned' too...but our difference is that for me, looks still count. lol. i'm attracted to good-looking people, but i don't fall for anyone seriously when i don't know their personality and intelligence level. or if i know their attitude and i hate it. to tell you the truth, i rarely ever feel lust towards any of my crushes. most of the time it's just pure affection.<br>  <br>  don't change your way of seeing boys! that may just save your life from depression or suffering or whatever. never mind being old-fashioned, what you should think of is being right and being true to yourself. and besides, why rush in picking the person you'll live with for the rest of your life? it's no task to be taken lightly, for sure. ;)|`|eqCI4M9Yaa	well im like that except i go for girls not guys and i dont care about looks either personality much more atractive but im a 16yr old boy so your not the only one and i 100% agree with you|`|gzBk5NMVaa	I am 15 but always feel urge "down there". I don't know how you managed so far not getting involved with a guy.|`|DHwuMoWbaa	you are the only one to overcome this phobia eat cheese|`|6AzWUY8Gaa	You are not the only one! I am with you and big ups girl!!<br>  <br>  Stay safe and blessed!|`|2WwjS29Maa	you're not the only one. personality def makes people more attractive, but i've always had to have at least a teeny bit of an attraction to start off a relationship, then the personality makes them even cuter.<br>  a guy def has to be smart and interesting. he can be the hottest guy in the world, but if u can't have a conversation with him, he's useless.<br>  not having sex b4 marriage is a good value to have...but u don't want to end up with someone who u have zero sexual chemistry with, so keep that in mind too.<br>  being mushy in public is weird for me too. an occasional peck on the cheek or holding of the hands is ok...but not all the time. I also have a fear of being intimate in front of people's parents...just can't do it!!|`|VC4jncIaaa	Well, being attracted personality more doesn't make you weird. I can think a guy is cute, but I could say they need to change the way they are. So for me, you can look however you want but I love guys that laid back or good hearted and are a great person and have great personalities. Being attractive physically is the plus. lol I've been told the same, that I'm really attractive and should go for someone better looking, but let's be serious...not ALL good looking guys actually have a great personality or ar smart for that matter. My bf was average to me when we first started going out, he's joined the mil and his looks increased and I think he could do better than me now. :D|`|vP00YUsLaa	ha! ill be honest with you hun. im exactly like that too. my friends would always tell me.. 'why do u always date the ugly guys?' most of the guys i dated were fatboys. lol. i read in an article on how to stay in a longer/serious relationship. and it says that women who date the not so goodlooking guys have longer relationships, why is that? well first off the woman in the relationship doesnt have to worry about other girls hittin on their man. second the man is always faithful to his hot looking woman. if u know the show king of queens.. you'll get what im saying. but im actually like that. im currently in a relationship with a nerd. my nerd :)|`|y21ioFV5aa	Don't worry there are still many people like you out there because i'm the same as you were very protective of our virginity and that is something to be proud of.Reserve yourself for the one you trully love is what i say and it's true i like boy's personality more than the looks i feel in love at 1st sight w/this boy but i tried to avoid him but than 4 months later( I know kind of long right ) i got to know his personality and he is so kind and a gentlemen as well not like his looks when you see him at school he looks like a loner anyways this is not a bad thing don't be like other girls who screw around okay
PY51kBTjaa	haven't you already poste this under "How can i get my man to turn into a yes man?"|`|DTZmqnCkaa	You say that he helps with cooking and cleaning and leaves you breathless in the bedroom right?  Why on earth is that not good enough?  Why would you possibly want to change him?  He's right in that you only THINK you want a yes man, but weak non-thinking people are a drag.  You're already wearing the trousers and just buy another remote control.|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	First, Are you telling him or are you asking? Are you taking up his every waking moment when the two of you are together? Why do you want to wear the pants?  What if he gets tired of the harassment?  Oh you think it can't happen because it hasn't yet?  Interesting!|`|yCBpl2Jgaa	It does sound like your rather controlling. "I always know best." And where's the fun in always agreeing?? If you want him to agree with you more just compromise!!<br>  <br>  xx|`|tLuALLwQaa	become a lesbo. it sounds like that is what you want|`|7AUqSr4uaa	sorry but you're being greedy.<br>  your fella does things for you a lot of men don't, you should be grateful for what you have.<br>  Plus, being the one who makes the decisions is not all its cracked up to be. My ex was the one who was always right, and sometimes I really hated it, but my current partner and I are much more equal, but i feel a lot more pressure when it comes to making decisions, i seem to have to make them all the time and he goes along with it, which is fairer, but not necessarily better!|`|VIHw7kRkaa	Honestly......he is right.  I was like that with my boyfriend for a while too.  And when he finally started listening to eveything I told him I got sooo bored!  We have been together for 4 years, and that lasted for about 2 months.  I did what I wanted and told him what to do all the time.  But honestly, even if we dont admit it, girls love the "hard to get" game.  It attracts us even more.  When a guy tells us what to do we get aggrivated, but it attracts us because we know that he is in control.  Maybe were different, but it sounds exactly like what I went through.  Enjoy it.  If he helps with the baby, house and is good in bed......thats already way more than what most girls want!  Be grateful, thats all we can do........you could be a single mother with no one!  :)  Good Luck!!!|`|yb56Vwlkaa	Look. Do it like this. I promise i'm right because i've done it many times before because guys like to get their panties in a bunch because they have a penis. Don't let him give you insight. REMEMBER. HE HAS A PENIS. <br>  You set down a rule, he refuses..walk out of the house, hang up the phone, etc. Start demanding respect and ignoring that a argument or him throwing a fit and dumping you for a day or two may come about.<br>  <br>  Act like a man and you will be treated like a man. If you don't want a *****, don't put the pants on. Change your mind.|`|c177b6236d4e423617ec27290ee2f0c7aa	he thinks that when you ask him to do this and that what you're actually conveying is your impression that he's not enough for you / that you don't like how he is. <br>  Try explaining that you're 2 different creatures and you love him to bits, still you have your own personality and would like to be able to express yourself ... ;)  (don't make it out as something that he doesn't do, make it something that you would like to do).|`|83967d29b62071929323e508eab23abaaa	well... as u said Just gals to look over your matter. So, I m sorry 4 interrupting.<br>  <br>  But yea can say 1 thing just u don't consider my answer to be a guys one, and just u consider as a whole, as in relationships, then I can say that.... Either U think of keeping a hold on your husband or he thinks of such on u, then in both ways The relationships is going to a dark stage. <br>  <br>  In relationships, there should be nothing like domination, Relationships are not carried out on one's end, its a mutual understanding, a trust, a faith and moreover a true sharing of life and every moments, and anywhere if u start dominating over the other, U will start bowing the seeds of ill-feelings nd negative thoughts in the others mind, that smday is gng to harm ur happy living life. <br>  <br>  So Better go on in this life with some compromises, smtimes frm ur side nd smtimes frm his. Love starts with trust nd understanding but blooms with sacrifices nd compromises. So Think over it nd just dont commit any such mistake which may turn ur happy life into the dark shadow of the same. WIsh U good Luck nd a happy Life ahead.|`|NDFN04sqaa	Well i have to say if he is a "yes" man you will get bored.  If you always get your way you will eventually start walking all over him (not on purpose)  then you will start to feel guilty about it.  Then you will start resenting him.  It's like a dominio effect.  I guess i just like a guy who will say whats on his mind and not what i want to hear. If he is always predictable then its not fun.|`|K6fasl6kaa	he's right.  do you really love him or do you just want a "stepford husband"?  your husband should be your best friend.|`|x4jZuA9Daa	A realtionship is about compromise.. you shouldnt have to dominate over one another.. you both should listen to each other and give and take to make each other happy... men don't want to do everything their women tell them too... and that is what makes them different from us.. you have to understand that its not in his nature to just let you wear the pants.. and frankly you need to be equal with your boyfriend not higher.. that truely will make a long lasting relationship|`|2jiBqNpuaa	It's sick. Dont be a control woman.<br>  <br>  I agreed with him, you may have dumped him ages ago if he always does what you want him to do. Haha.|`|FzFSzilmaa	maybe you shouldn't try being a control freak... guys don't like that.. :D|`|AfbjU9Guaa	Arghhhh my eyesss!.... it burns it buuuuurns!
YCXxP43Laa	You have to pluck up the courage before it's too late. I recently done this, i'm really shy, but I liked this guy and wasn't going to be seeing him much longer, before i left I asked him to go bowling. We did and (fingers crossed) it seems to be working. You've nothing to lose... except him so go for it!|`|AA10283947	Try dropping some school books on the floor in his presence if he stoops to help pick them up you will gain a chance to speak and thank him over coffee.|`|R1gqthbmaa	From the time we are at EXACTLY the same place, I can't advice you with personal experience. I'll just tell you what I think it's the right thing to do.<br>  First of all start talking with him. For things that have nothing to do with love. Just things he likes, like soccer or wrestling or whatever else he likes. So, eventually you'll become friends. And maybe good friends. After that I think it would be easier to confess him what you feel. And if you are still nervous about talking to him, don't worry. He won't say you anything for talking to him. Just find the right opportunity and then you'll see that everything will go as you have been planning until now...|`|Ai4kGM1Oaa	Whoa, he's in your van? Sounds like your further along than you've let on, sounds more like you've already kidnapped him, and have him pidgeon-holed in your van like some sort of child abductor. <br>  <br>  But if you don't and I just launched on an unrelated tangent, if so, just tell him that he's hot and that some girls who shall remain nameless, *cough *cough may be interested in tasting his forbidden fruit, if you know what I mean... oh c'mon you guys are sick... I meant METAPHORICAL fruit.|`|AnfbrZFuaa	Just have a normal conversation with him, and ask him who he likes. If he doesn't like you and he asks why, just tell him you were just curious. If he likes you, and he asks who you like, tellim.|`|KPhmCcmgaa	Be yourself.|`|joLmPLL3aa	well the main thing is, is to have confidence in yourself. then you will find it easier to talk to him :) but dont tell him straight away if you feel he feels the same way about you then go for it, you only live once and lifes to short. just talk to him normally maybe add him on facebook, bebo etc . maybe even get his email 'as friends' . then you never no what could happen, gettin to know him first is the  best thing you can do .. good luck :D and remember to be confident|`|l9wTE5eCaa	Find something you have in common, then comment on that. Like, say that you're interested in learning his instrument, and if he can show you some tricks. Or, if he's into sports, ask him to teach you or arrange to play the sport with him.<br>  <br>  Or, if your friends arranged a party or a movie night, invite him.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|eSp3Gx8iaa	That is a problem, especially if you are shy.<br>  <br>  Start by making eye contact and smiling. It should hint to him that you like him. But if you really want to tell him, you have 2 options.<br>  <br>  Tell him straight up that you like him. That will be very awkward for the both of you.<br>  <br>  The second is the longer way that is less shocking. Just start talking to him, hang out, be his friend, get close then tell him. It will be less shocking, but it takes a while, and you have to break the ice first though.<br>  <br>  Whatever it is, I wish you all the best! GOOD LUCK!!|`|13e023efcaecd812aa9552a17a328b2caa	Break the ice. Say hello, make 'small talk', don't be obvious.<br>  <br>  When you feel comfortable, ask HIM out, moveie, party whatever.<br>  <br>  Just do it!|`|80V7RxwQaa	try to talk to him before he leaves because if not you are going to lose him.<br>  try to get to talk to him first about you and then make the next step.|`|bELskj1Gaa	Talk to him regularly first. Get comfortable. Then tell him.|`|gZLWVVOQaa	first make friends with him...<br>  don't be shy...<br>  make him comfortable with u..<br>  then if u have a chance to say that u like him...<br>  then tell him before it's too late|`|o9QqsgYGaa	just talk 2 him..like nice wheather we are having or what r u going 2 do after college...etc...|`|zAhF9q4Laa	tell him
AA11843942	this happens all the time - just try to not spend as much time with this person - you can still be friends, but just hang out every once in a while.  <br>  everyone gets on every ones nerves at some point.  you just have to know how to handle it and not let it get in the way of a good friendship.|`|DCH0yLLHaa	It sucks but you grow out of people. My best friend for 2 years turned against me, saying I was annoying and she didn't want to ever be friends again. People change and try to be cool, popular, all that junk, but it's not your fault. They're trying to please other people.|`|pVaZty4Maa	maybe something he heard or something like that, why don't you just ask him??|`|23f7be6415d7965c88f38a51d089c640aa	ANYTHING WRONG.
dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	gosh you could write anything for a 5 year old.  he probably would prefer you just give him a cute hallmark card or such as he wont really appreciate yours or 'my' efforts.  hehe<br>  <br>  but, I'll give it a go:<br>  <br>  you're really sweet <br>  you're really cool<br>  you're the most charming kid in school<br>  we are buddies<br>  we are pals<br>  when you get older I'll tell ya about gals<br>  <br>  <br>  hehe|`|QTgm2ZTvaa	LOL give what you already have written, ^^<br>  <br>  don't be shy ^^<br>  <br>  atleast you can proudly say i wrote this one for you ^^
JAdNkzENaa	if you are going to put tule around the kisses i guess that would be cute - otherwise they are not going to stay on there. <br>  <br>  id say 2 although 2 kisses is kind of a sucky favor...who wants a spoon and 2 hershey kisses?|`|hkwBR1moaa	I think two would suffice.  One from him and one from you.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Hmmm, two doesn't seem like enough.  You know what would be cool - buy those huge hershey kisses - you can usually find them around Valentine's Day or Easter - and give each person one big one for the favor.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	hmmm....tough to say, I would probably do as many as would fit on the spoon maybe 3-5 with tulle around it and the note attached with a ribbon in my wedding colors.|`|03n14OLLaa	Two or Four. An even number so that they get the same amount from both of you. More than four might not stay on a spoon though.|`|crxbob5jaa	3 - odds numbers seem to work better and 5 would be too many for a spoon to hold.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	Normally you would use an odd number.  Depending on the spoon, it would be 3 and with the touling or fabric and ribbon will be cute.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider not only kisses, but huggs (by hershey too) too.  Then you would have huggs and kisses from the Mr. and Mrs. :)|`|AA10698189	I think two like the previous answerer - one from you and one from the groom.  Good luck!|`|1cb3542838b379bb2f5a7c25c04d579baa	1-2.|`|37803e6c4f82e6a134d585be72409c93aa	I think 2 would be enough. One from you and the other from your husband. Congratulations!|`|I4d5PCKQaa	I think two is good enough.|`|uhRKCb9kaa	i do't think you need to do this,

mfcVhbYhaa	If it was really a misunderstanding as you said, Just ask her for another chance like it is the last time to meet or something and explain that by yourself or try to tell any of her best friends how that happened and they shall explain to her the whole situation.<br>  And try to figure if there is someone that makes her think so about you because it happens alot these days >.<.<br>  <br>  Hope you get back soon :)

CNSGz12zaa	Not in front of people and not in church or near it! Privacy is needed for a first kiss!|`|RkimYgEtaa	Aww, you sound like such a sweetie. Anyway, if she wants to do it there then I think you should do it there. You want her first kiss to be memorable, so she should have it her way. It would be better in a private place but just let her do what she wants, you could casually suggest that you do it in a private place and say you want it to be special for her and that it doesn't matter where it is to you and stuff, just make sure she doesn't think you're embarassed of her or something. Good luck hun.|`|zmxNjL5saa	You can went ahead and tell her to choose another day that will be favourate to her.|`|OAYaeW22aa	yeah i would think that your first kiss should be private. but if you arent comfortable doin it with ppl around you then got to the side to do it then|`|jBigEy0Caa	It's good that you have standards.  Let her know that church is not the ideal place to kiss for the first time.|`|t3G5xSbIaa	o come on kyle it will be fun and romantic don't worry about it and enjoy the kiss hun!|`|2U0BtIZ8aa	tell her what ur telling us<br>  tell her that if its her first time, u want to make it special for her an have it somewhere private and so it would be more romantic and worth remebering.<br>  <br>  is it her tht has a problem or u being too shy to give ur gf her first kiss in public around ur friends and her friends??<br>  no matter what<br>  good luck and give her an amazing kiss thats worth remebering. :P<br>  <br>  answer mine plz?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090223045507AAgP1UQ&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|drEfr9waaa	First kiss after church in front of a bunch of people?  Takes me back to the time a guy made his first move on me after the Sunday service and in front of my dad.  What a turn off!  You have  my mega sympathy.  You will die from embarrassment, I promise.|`|Ks0BrqHBaa	if it is her first kiss then yes. i know i wouldn't have wanted my first kiss to be public. plus if you are alone it is a little more personal then if you are in a big crowd of people|`|rJxpXs35aa	dude just grab her and kiss her like you know what your doing and don't pay attention to who is around you pay attention to her.|`|tDnsnIOSaa	thats actually super cute, but you shouldn't plan your first kiss. It should be sincere and from the heart, not planned down to every detail like which way to turn your head!!!<br>  Very cute though :)|`|ME7cBSkoaa	i agree with u, cos it should be a special moment between u and her, not u her and the other guys, just tell her u feel uncomfortable with the idea.|`|eqCI4M9Yaa	well you could suggest to make it more private but if she doesnt care about people watchin then you shouldnt worry about it|`|SPdo80YJaa	Umm.. I don't quite get why she would want it in front of everyone.. I would have thought a private place may have been better... Each to their own I guess?|`|sExo0KD2aa	It's not really the embarrassement... A kiss is a sign of love and not of something like "Hey look, I have a boyfriend and I am giving my first kiss right now!".<br>  <br>  Definitely it should be private. Just the two of you, somewhere romantic with a nice view. It is not only your first kiss, it is the first kiss ever! It only happens once. :)|`|vP00YUsLaa	trust me... EVERY girl including myself has been there.. we all want our first kiss to be special. sometimes it would happen spontaneously or we want it to happen based on how we planned it. tell her that you understand that she hasnt had her first kiss and she wants to kiss you. the fact that you posted this in the first place is the problem... you're UNCOMFORTABLE! thats what you need to tell her. it wont be a special kiss if one of you isnt feeling right, correct? tell her that youre sorry but you're too nervous and uncomfortable.. and if she's being stubborn with it, just realize that you did the right thing for the both of you.|`|vOivX0ZUaa	Best way to dish out that first kiss is....<br>  A. don't worry about the people around you<br>  B. catch her off gaurd (you'll like the reaction)<br>  C.

JAGWgic2aa	You obviously haven't found the person for you.  About 6 years back I would have agreed with your ideas about relationships too.  But once you run across that one person that grabs hold of you and just won't let go it will rattle your world in a way you could never imagine.  A relationship is what you get when you find that person that makes you a better one!   You should be able to support each other, talk to each other, laugh, debate, challenge each other, but most of all make the other person laugh and smile when all they felt they could do was cry.  That's why I'm in my relationship with my husband.  Oh, yea, and the sex helps ;)|`|4EWCegiRaa	1.  Everything sounds terrible when you describe it like that.<br>  2.

Having someone to hold your hand and comfort you when you are sick or sad? How about having someone who always lends a willing ear to your venting? How about the unbelievably happy feeling that you are not alone, someone actually understands you, actually loves you as is, and that no matter what, will always have your back. If you really think sex is the only important thing in life then I can see why you are freakin alone. Any **** can give you sex, but can she give you comfort? Companionship?|`|Rgj6kTOwaa	security, happiness, feeling loved, loving someone, friendship, having a laugh with someone who has seen u at ur absolute worse! <br>  <br>  i know what you mean about kind of is that it? approach to love! but i think this comes from someone who has perhaps never been loved or loved someone as when you do nothing else in the world matters! i know that if someone said to me now we will give you a million pounds to travel and see the world, but you HAVE to leave your fiancee i wud laugh in their face and go home and get snuggled up in bed with my fiancee holding me and tell him what this stupid person said to me today! i think your perspective on love, like anything else changes when u have experinced it to its full extent, you cant really know until you have felt it! <br>  <br>  evryone is different, some people never want to be tied down to marriage and children and if thats what they want then great, but when u experience love, and that FEELING it really is the best especially when its resiprocated! i see your outlook as being very negative, maybe from a failed relationship or something or just not having a special relationship but when the time comes you will read back on this and what i have said and knw wot i mean :)|`|Poru0GM7aa	my friend,<br>  u need a guidance as i also one thought like you till i started meditation and yoga.<br>  u will get ur answars there.self realisation.knowing yourself.<br>  ur here to spread energy to the deserving.enlighten yourself....etc etc..<br>  may be some wime i may explain to u else go through indian vedas,gita.u will have ur answer.<br>  just try to know why ur boen.why ur here.u will get ur answers.|`|Vx4w4Cx5aa	Well actually, the reason why I'm with my boyfriend is because I would like to share my life with him and we have a great deal of emotional closeness and a real bond, like best friends, aswell as lovers.|`|zqUeYLhIaa	Ur antisocial. and ifsex is what matters to u then go to a wh0re house :)|`|4wGzrkSTaa	Well, the way I see it is, a relationship is about being able to be completely, comfortable, making you always feel safe and so on. I look at realationships like sprots teams, exept the two in the relationship are the only two players, at first! Or sometimes the team won't grow, but either way . . . Like in baseball, you have "Secreat signals for every little thing."<br>      <br>          "The Thing that people forget while in a relationship, or simply can't OR choose not to remember is that in the very begining of you both, it is Mutual; and your compatibility is something you share in common.  The buttereflies, The new-ness of the persons touch and kiss and breathe on ur neck gives you an incredibable sense of furfillment, but as times presses on and maybe a few ugly aguments or maybe she got sick and you saw her the worst you have ever seen her,! <br>     "Whatever, dumb excuses make up for being distant, regreatfrul or worse unfaithfull are no excuses at all. "Why, because just like in the begining, it's mutual, and if there's something that the other's doing that you simply feel u can live without, confide in ur partner, and if they dont get offended or hurt feelings, but instead they are understanding to your pet-pieve and at least agree to Try and control the flaw you hate, THAT LOVE!!! but if your ordered to deal with it that's probably going to end fairly soon "50/50": everything. "And I m not talking in the means of "Equal Right's of a man and a woman, but I'm talking about compassian, (YOU SCRATCH MY BACK, I SCRATCH YOU)  "At least you know you back will never itch with him beside you, and the feeling of that will be MUTUAL"!!! I you catch my drift?"
ZmikGFTEaa	Sounds like you really love that other girl but maybe she dint like you the 'loving you' way but just liked you and so she was just fooling around i suppose..<br>  if you keep thinking of ways to forget her then i bet you will never be able to forget her!<br>  now that you found her cheating, being disloyal to you then you should consider yourself lucky that it dint go any further beyond this as it would have been much more difficult to come out of it had it been even more a deep relationship..<br>  Now, dont think of disgrace or something.. she was just a learning experience..<br>  Move on.. she never deserved you then why bother thinking about her?<br>  <br>  If you still cant stop thinking of her then go up to her and ask her if she lieks you and then she might  be able to clear any misconception that you happened to see ..<br>  Good luck!|`|tDnsnIOSaa	is internet cheating really cheating?

So good luck....  Don't try to forget her.. Okay !!!|`|JHjeb4aaaa	This is an age old question. <br>  <br>  The circumstance around HOW you developed feelings for this girl really doesn’t matter. What does matter is that you have and what to do now.<br>  <br>  So here is my humble opinion:<br>  <br>  The first thing you need to do is talk to this girl.....tell her everything including how all this is making you feel and ask her where you stand.<br>  <br>  Then take it from there depending on her response.<br>  <br>  If she feels the same way about you and this was just a misunderstanding because neither of you had set rules or boundaries for this "internet relationship", then you should forgive her. Then both set rules and boundaries for your relationship and start afresh.<br>  <br>  If she was under the impression that you were in a monogamous "internet relationship" then she has cheated without a doubt and again you have 2 choices. Forgive her. Then both set rules and boundaries for your relationship, and start afresh. Or do not forgive her and move on.<br>  <br>  Coming to the point.......when you have been hurt in any kind of relationship the only thing that will heal it is time, unfortunately. <br>  <br>  But there are things you can do to help. <br>  Deleting everything only really works if you can't get everything back, if you can it's really a pointless exercise. <br>  Talking/flirting with other girls is a quick fix to boost your self esteem but is only short term. And you should also think of the feelings of the other girls, that you are essentially using to feel better.<br>  <br>  The best advice I feel I can give is finding genuine things to keep you busy. Go out with other friends and ask them not to mention her. And also ask that if you mention her they comfort you and then quickly change the subject. Other than that just give yourself time. <br>  <br>  Being hurt by a member of the opposite (or to be PC the same sex) is a rite of passage for most people; it is something that we all have to go through at some point.<br>  <br>  Just try to keep your dignity intact and keep busy and everything else will feel better with time.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and I know you will feel better soon. <br>  Chin up. <br>  xx|`|izWoPI28aa	Hmm.. I've had this problem before =P and the reason why you actually love her is because you and her must have really connected. You must have really expressed yourself too her, and so did she. Your going to get over her over time. Just delete her off your phone contacts. and other things so you can't contact or even see her name. I was talking to this girl online for around 4 months then she cheated on me.. and all i did was delete her from everything and just started flirting/talking with TONS of girls. she will go away. but it's going to take time.. I dunno if i actually helped.. but thats the best answer i can give. good luck buddy! =D|`|5935b0c19c59fa4c34fe916dafeb8aceaa	Just move on, it would be best...<br>  Time heals all...<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck,

8gIy4DCdaa	He may be unhappy or stressed out about something. Maybe you need to find out what it is? Men change many times. When they are your friend, they act one way. Then they change when you date them. A lot of times you feel sad because yeah you might of gained a boyfriend but you lost a good friend. Then you get use to that lifestyle and you marry them and guess what they change again. Then you have a baby with them and they act weird and sometime insensitive while you are pregnant as if they are pregnant too. And after the baby the act another way. So men change. They are easy to stress. Women can handle more stress and take on more things. We think that if we can do it they can do it but they can not always. Don't  blame yourself or look for something complex we are more complex then men. It may be something simple. Find out about work, on the job and financially, about how he feels about you? Is he having any family problems? Is he depressed? Is he gaining weight? Is he feeling guilty about something? Approach the situation loving and concerned and not making accusations. Men hate to be accused even when they are guilty. Never accuse unless you got all the facts and all the proof that can not be denied. Don't diagnose him or tell him what the problem is let him tell you what the problem is. He may be telling you, just think about what he is saying, what is making him mad, and try to talk to him when both of you are in a better and relaxed mood and had plenty of rest. When the kids are not around? If it turns into an arguement do not argue back, be the bigger person and walk away until he calms down and can talk to you respectfully and always talk to him respectfully.|`|pVaZty4Maa	i don't know, maybe if you just sit him down and have a serious talk maybe yall two can fix this problem but it really sounds as if he don't want to be with you {sorry to say} i really hope everything works out sweetie|`|fW5qcU5uaa	Don't sweat it.  Us guys ***** about everything once we're married.  It's just a phase.  I'm no marriage counselor, but I wouldn't worry 'bout it.|`|ALkhwI23aa	maybe he feels left out u need more spice go to hte bathroom with him and do something crazy|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Sorry to say this, but it sounds like he didn't want to get married.<br>  <br>  Maybe he did it because he felt pressured to do so....and he now regrets it and feels angry and trapped. SORRY.<br>  <br>  I guess you need to sit down and talk to him...honestly.<br>  <br>  Tell him how you feel, and ask him to be open with you. If he can tell you in your face he feels trapped, then at least you will have the problem out in the open...so you can decide what to do and how to deal with it.<br>  <br>  But if you keep ignoring this situation, sooner or later things will get so tense and heated they will explode. So be careful....and see if you can find out why he is acting this way. He sounds like he is on the verge of being abusive, so be very careful here. I mean it!<br>  <br>  Remember...we cannot change other people, or make them act as we want. IF you don't know and don't like this man who is now your husband, consider leaving for a while. Maybe he needs some time apart and he needs to evaluate if he loves you or not.<br>  Good luck.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	what should I do?<br>  <br>  Might try talking to him and if you guys aren't capable of that than why did you remain together for 11 years / marry.|`|KhC2zSvnaa	I would sit down and try to talk to him. There is obviously something going on with him. He seems very unhappy, This isn't healthy for you and your kids. If talking doesn't work, I would consider counseling.|`|Jcu24pe3aa	It sounds like an abusive relationship is starting. You need to get help.<br>  If it continues this way violence is the next step.

mQSk7fB6aa	The laws have changed recently, and are far more relaxed now.<br>  <br>  Basically, to get married in a church in the UK, you need to demonstrate a close connection to it.  This can mean that you live (or have lived) in the parish, your parents were married there, or that you have a historical connection with the church.  Plus, there are many more.<br>  <br>  Since you were christened there, you should already have the history required, but you need to check with the local vicar first.  If need be, you may need to attend services regularly there in the run up to the wedding.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	If you are not the religious type then why do you want to get married in Church ? I understand your sentiments about the village etc., but its slightly hypocritical to get married in Church when you are not religious. I am sure if you explain to the minister of this village Church that you have been christened there and and went to the Church primary school but you are not the religious type he will ask you the same question.|`|03n14OLLaa	I would ask the leader of the church if it would be alright and if it is then go for it! Good luck!
aez7WCqQaa	Believe him & what he says.<br>  <br>  My roommates used to hold me down my first year of college and make me say 10 things I love about myself. This was everytime I made a mean comment about myself. Maybe you need to have someone do the same for you.|`|6cui8pffaa	Im in the exact same position :[|`|679a9612ab8ce1cdc2658471a9a16fcbaa	I am in exactly the same situation as you so I understand what you are feeling. The only thing is, my insecurities were caused by my best friend always making sly remarks to me and making me feel worthless. She is no longer a friend of mine.<br>  <br>  I have got a little bit better now, I learnt to trust my bf and believe in what he says. I realised that by always being insecure I was actually driving him away. He said I built a wall around me and he couldn't get through and that made him feel like I didn't love or trust him enough.<br>  <br>  The way I got over it was to simply put belief in what my boyfriend told me. I often thought to myself, why would he say he loves me and doesn't want anybody else and still be with me?
8XKmMBU7aa	If you can't find any other person, you should kill her girl friend.<br>  and it doesn't matter that how many girl friends or wives does a man have. You also may live with him or you may say him that he may live with you in extra house 12 hours and can live with his other girl friend 12 hours. <br>  You are rude one, don't have words to say you anything.<br>  You still want to cheer him, die bast ard.<br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Cut off all contact with him.<br>  <br>  He is EX for a reason.<br>  Once a cheater etc.<br>  <br>  And you`re not squeaky clean either by encouraging him to be unfaithful.|`|hHndD5SEaa	so what you really want  him to do is dump her - and go out with you - so that he can then cheat on you with someone is it?? Yep sounds like a great idea! WHY would you even demoralise yourself by being with a guy like this ?<br>  xx|`|rUsFKFQ8aa	hes a 18 year old horny man! you are throwing yourself at him and losing all self respect in the process by going after someone elses boyfriend no matter who it is that starts it. Of course hes going to keep coming after you because he knows he can get it! <br>  Tell him no for once, and move on he has told you he isnt interested in leaving his girlfriend so leave the poor bloke alone and stop tempting him and thats coming from a woman!|`|8zXiqIK0aa	i would stay well away.you are to young for such drama. he sounds vile. any man that cheats is disgusting and lacks respect 4 you and and the other woman. and if you know he has a girlfriend you should stay away. how would you feel if he was your boyfriend? and he was cheating on you.|`|aDeDOmxBaa	You wait until you get older and more than kissing gets involved! <br>  <br>  One thing from experience, you cannot make someone do something you want them to do. You can give them all the gentle shoves in the right direction, hell you can even hit them in the face with the obvious, but people will always decide themselves. If he's cheating on her with you and he doesn't leave her for you now, then he is not going to. Not many people ever actually do leave the girlfriend, i only know of it once ever and that didnt last more than two months. My ex left his girlfriend but it didnt work woth me in the end anyway! <br>  <br>  Reading from the above im not sure if sex is involved here. If it's not, this may be a reason why he stays with her. This doesn't mean though that you have to start sleeping with him to get him back, because thats not the answer either. If it comes to that, he is bad news. I have been here continuously since i was 14 and now im 24! Right up until last year i put up with crap like this because i was young. Now looking back i wish i got rid of every single person who made me feel this way and waited for someone to come along and treat me with respect. If you havent slept with anyone yet, do your best and wait for a while or at least until you know it is right. I promise you it will be worth it in the long run. Otherwise you end up in all sorts of situations when you are young that can be very hard to get over.  <br>  <br>  Im afraid that he may not be into you for anymore than what he gets from you now. The only way to try and break them up is to tell her. But i dont suggest you do this, it wont go down that well and you may be branded a liar!<br>  <br>  All the best,<br>  <br>  Gem x|`|C3VwhIIAaa	He is a young and horny dude. It goes to show right now he cant make a true commitment to ONE person. <br>  If you get him, and you might, I promise you he will do the same sneaky things around your back, and you will hate him for it, but still love him. <br>  Dont drill yourself, listen, there are sooooooo many guys that want a girl who are single. Dont get caught up in the drama. Your a young lil lady, just chill ok please.|`|vfcD8Ic1aa	even if he did break up with his gf how do you know that he wouldn't cheat on you lke he is with his gf?<br>  stay away from him and just let it go. you're being mean to the other girl by cheating with her bf.|`|1nVRMObiaa	Stay away from him before any of u, especially u, regrets.|`|Ub7MyiVeaa	yes|`|jofNPfqOaa	my best advice is to do you. if you really care for him let him be. if he does break up with his gf for you...you'll end up feeling like a home-wrecker. if he really wants to be with you he will come to you in his own time. dont wait for him either. continue to live your life. and dont put either of you in situations that will lead to making out or dry sex. if youre gonna make out and have dry sex you might as well have gone all the way. its still cheating nonetheless.

There are guys that are so insecure that they act "strange" when they like another person.<br>  In my case I used to do stupid things like jokes that at first looked rude, but I was not doing it on purpose, it was by default... then when I had the chance to talk to the girl, I always got the comment "I thought I didn't like you because the way you treated me".<br>  In fact, my wife hated me when I knew her, because I did a couple of jokes that seemed kind of rude, but I was in fact trying to get her attention :)|`|onrcmQf8aa	It's hard to call it.

Your wife has the right ot know that she could be at risk for an STD.<br>  <br>  Who's to say that there is no telling where else Lucy has been laying.

FtyLwqR5aa	No you were not wrong for stating your opinion of her. Let your hubby deliver the kids and pick them up. It is normal to dislike someone as you do her but you got to remember that it is his Mother and he loves her also. She has raised the man that you love so much and married. So she has done something right.|`|NDFN04sqaa	I think its okay to tell your husband how you feel about his mother, but only after he asks for your opinion.  No one wants to hear negative things about someone they love - even if they feel the same way.  My boyfriend can't stand his mom, and while i agree that she can be somewhat intrusive, it is not my place to pass judgment.  If he ask my opinion i tell him what i think but i keep it simple and to the point.  She may be what you say, but she is still his mother and he does love her - it would hurt him if his mother voiced a negative opinion about you because he loves you too!  As for the kids, don't let them see your negative opinion of her, eventually they will have their own and this should not be influenced by you.  And let the hubby transport them to her.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	If the two of you don't find a way to be on the same page when it comes to his mother - things will just continue to slide down hill.  I don't mean he has to give in 100% or that you have to give in 100% but the two of you need to find a "happy" middle ground when it comes to his mother.  If that means that you keep your opinions to yourself and he takes care of shuttling the kids to visit with his mom - so be it...My sister has one that's far worse than yours - try schizophrenic (seriously) - she and my BIL had to set their ground rules because his mom was starting to interfere too much with her mental illness.  If they can do it - you guys can do it!<br>  <br>  You won't find it without communication...the woman gave birth to your husband, she should get some respect.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Sometimes its tough if you don't like someone but just be civil for the sake of your family, there's no need to argue, just be polite with her but that doesn't mean you have to trust her.|`|j4PwaY5Jaa	just put up with her and dont trust her|`|pvZZ9Jzmaa	I love my in-laws.....they live about 3,000 miles away.|`|1ahp4VCdaa	I think you need to realise how much this will affect the children. This is their Grandmother and it would be unfair on them or her just because you don't like her. What you need to do is sit down and discuss things and tell her how you feel and get things out in the open. Think of the CHILDREN.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|ALkhwI23aa	wow that stinks if u wont things to work u r going to try to get a long with her   mildred sent me here to help you|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Mine hates me..|`|kKABnmbzaa	It will have an impact on the kids if you don't let them see there grandmother and you don't want the kids to think that it's there fault. Yes you and your mother-in-law may not get along for the benefit for the two of you put at least work it out for the kids. Now as far as you honesty to your husband about his mother your right about beign honest because if not it will break the 2 of you apart.  I was married and my mother-in-law couldn't stand me and still can't but guess what she has to let him go and live his life with his family and don't hold back how you feel to your husband he may be mad at the begining but he has to respect you for being open and honesty about your feelings towards your mother-in-law.
vn2Lq7hIaa	Lesbians are born lesbians.You can't turn a heterosexual woman into a lesbian, any more than you can turn a straight guy into a gay.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't let this stress you out, you have 3 children that need their father with a clear mind, and happy. if this lesbian girl comes to your place to "Visit" your wife, I would take the opportunity to have a 3 way talk expressing your dismay  in the way she is disrupting your marriage, and ask her to cease and desist. Let your wife know what you have planned .<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Not worry about it. If your wife is not Bi then you have nothing to worry about. You seem as if you might be a little intimidated by her.|`|m81dfyOYaa	I don't "tell" my husband what to do. In this instance though I would make it clear that the friend is creating stress for me and that I'd like her gone.  Friends don't or shouldn't cause maritial discord.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Perhaps because I am bisexual in orientation, I fully know something that you apparently do not: sexual preference is not a choice.  You have your sexuality, and it is literally impossible for someone to recruit you to the other side.  The fact that your wife married you is strong evidence that she is not a lesbian.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, though, this is where I must inform you that far more people are bisexual than you might suspect.  It is possible that your wife possesses some bisexual desires, and this so-called friend might be able to tempt her to cheat on you with her.<br>  <br>  I suggest you talk to the friend.  Invite her over for dinner or something.  At some point during the evening's conversation, ask her how she would feel if someone were trying to tempt away someone with whom she was in a committed relationship.|`|3y96DmJdaa	probably go mad at her, that is really bad!

I'd tell her it would be no different than you having a female friend who wanted you to dump divorce your wife and wanted to have sex with you. <br>  <br>  Regardless if you wife is bi-sexual or straight, the simple matter is that her friend is intruding upon your marriage and is making you uncomfortable.  Your wifes loyalty should be TO YOU, not this friend.|`|hYZIYla0aa	You need to get rid of her( the friend ),If she is a true friend,she would not behave so childishly. I do not believe in control over your spouse,but this is going to far.Your wife needs to put you and the children first,not her friend.She is jeopardizing her marriage at this point.Why would she want a friend like this in the first place? Whether she is lesbian or not,she is not a friend.I have gay friends and they do not play these games.|`|V1GKJh8zaa	It sounds like your wife's friend is NOT a friend. If she were, she'd be stayin' away from the playground to respect the relationship your wife has w/you.<br>  <br>  Now, if you're noticing something your wife isn't... then leave it be. Your wife is not going to take her friend seriously. If your wife notices and its irritating her, then she needs to let her friend go by the wayside. If your wife likes the attention and is hemming and hawing - ya'll need to see a counselor.<br>  <br>  Good luck - no matter what happens. Just don't do anything illegal and if it comes to cheating and etc... might want to look up Dr Phil's book on Relationship Rescue. (its easy to read and all about you).|`|tvK1xjzkaa	I would whip out your manhood and show her there's no competition and to leave your wife alone because this woman is already satisfied.

Either way tell your wife she needs to put her friend in check.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	You may be misinterpreting the situation.  Just because your wife's friend constantly champions the benefits of lesbianism it doesn't mean that she is trying to convert.  Discuss your worries with your wife and let her take any necessary action.|`|9SSO454taa	she is what you called a evil person, and anyone who dose that should be shot.<br>  <br>  sorry for being so nasty but when kids are involved then i get nasty.|`|62gMbgb1aa	Just Kick Her A$$!!|`|40ed361ed7df354988fb96506fac28e3aa	with  friends like that  who needs enemies|`|13353fcc774ebbeac5a1b4f512369b49aa	I would tell my wife it bothered me. <br>  You and your wife are responsible for setting up "boundaries" to help keep your relationship safe. Talk to your wife to see if she agrees with you on this. See if your wife has a way to deal with the pressuring. If not, she should lose the friend. After all, what friend wants to break up another's marriage.<br>  This isn't showing weakness, but prudence. You are trying to protect your family.|`|D33VRTz8aa	Well stop talking to this friend.

WRONG!

I am also getting married in July, and the wedding will be 16 hrs away from my hometown, so the only family member of mine that will be there are my dad and 1 sister.

If you go around trying to please everyone, you yourselves will not be pleased and it will not be all that you dreamed. <br>  Do what is best for YOU. <br>  I have 7 sisters and 1 brother and they were all a little upset, but they got over it and are still happy for us. <br>  You can't please everyone all of the time. <br>  Good Luck and congratulations on everything, god bless you. :)|`|dvNWbUgLaa	This is your wedding, not his mom's.

IKXZZDH9aa	Here are your problems and solutions to each.<br>  <br>  1. She moved without serving you notice.<br>   - You need to file a motion for enforcement of the specific terms of the order which I am certain include her giving you notice, the court notice, and possibly needing your permission if she moves out of a geographical restriction if one is included in your order. <br>  <br>  2. She changed her number and didn't inform you.<br>   - Again, included in your motion for enforcement, this should be part of the alleged violations as I am sure your order stipulates that she is to provide you with working phone numbers.<br>  <br>  3. Your ex is denying you visitation with your child.<br>   - Again, this should be included in your violations, BUT for it to be a violation you MUST make the attempt to pick up your child at the designated place in the court order. Each time she denies your visitation it is a separate offense. <br>  <br>  4. Your ex's mother is assisting in her secreting the child and preventing the child from being with you. <br>   - You need to file a separate suit for Interference with Possessory Interest in a Child. This suit allows for the grandmother to face civil penalties for denying or helping deny your visitation.<br>  <br>  5. Both your ex and the mother are denying your visitation.<br>   - You need to call the police when you go to the residence to make an attempt to pick up your child. Some departments will actually enforce the criminal statute of interference with child custody. Or, they will at least provide a police report for you to carry when you get to trial.<br>  <br>  You need to learn to prepare documents such as motions and petitions so that you can pursue suit against your ex. If you cannot afford an attorney, get a copy of the Sampson and Tindall Texas Family Code Annotated, as well as the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. You'll need them to prepare your cases and try them.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Contacting the court is going to do you no good. They will only tell you that they cannot give legal advice, and that you need to consult an attorney. By Texas Law, they are not allowed to help you other than taking your money when you pay a filing fee.|`|578T0aU4aa	First of all ,since its a court order that the both of yoou have joint custody,you can bring charges against her for not letting you see your son.YOu need to contact the court  and tell them that she is not letting you see your son and if they dont do anything about it you need to contact your local child support program.Is your name on the borth certificate and if its not she doesnt have to let you see your son,she holds all he power.Call the state department in the state tht you live in if u have legitimise your son .Have you ever been proven to be abusive in a court of law.Also remember that your ex is the one hurting in the long run if she doesnt let uyou see your son.Sooner or later your son will be grown and he will remember the way his mother has done him when it comes to you and it will come back and backfire on her.I know it is painful and hurting not seeing your son but there will come a day when she cannot stop him from seeing you.If you know in your heart that you are a good samaritian then dont let your ex get you down and out.I hope this will help you out and lead you in a new direction.|`|ZNe6B9TQaa	Art,<br>  my apologies, this is a tough situation and there isn't really an easy answer.  You would need another attorney to solve the legal issues regarding this.  The best way to find one in this sort of situation while strapped for cash would be to look for slightly bigger family law firms that would be able to do (and do) pro bono work from time to time and see if they would be interested in taking your case.  You could track seek out civil/human rights attorneys that do pro bono, too.  But chances are they will know nothing about this kind of law and won't take it.  <br>  <br>  Worst case scenario, try your best to keep in touch with your son as much as you can and let him know that you love him dearly so that when he is 18 and free, he'll know that you always cared about him.<br>  <br>  Agree with the person above about a camera.  Always think of ways to cover yourself since your ex-wife is just going to keep trying to accuse you of stuff.|`|hXz9jZnCaa	naturally the court is like that they all think we men are the problem in life... if you established a legalized joint custody of your child then enforce your rights, if the judge still doesn't pay attention move to another judge until you find someone to help you... if someone does contact the texas government and trace down your family to make it safer bring a camera and hide it to prove you don't abuse your child.... if she brings you to court and accuses you again of beating your child show them the film and prove to them that she's the liar not you..... Good luck to you and God bless... don't give up on your child...|`|3SSVBJAqaa	Ok Art, here is what you have to do. Find out if your state has laws about parental kidnapping laws. These laws are set-up so that one parent cannot leave the state with the child/children without permission of the other parent, or courts. <br>  <br>  Here is a list of resources for you for organizations that can help :<br>  <a href="http://www.menstuff.org/resources/resourcefiles/fathers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.menstuff.org/resources/resour...</a>
hgaNxhoaaa	He's not going to pay you back, and he's not really your friend. Friends pay you back when they say they're going to, as soon as they can afford it. Basically, poker and snacks are more important to your friend than you are. At some point, you're going to have to either tell him you're forgetting about the debt and that he doesn't have to pay it back, or risk losing the friendship and tell him you want to money he said he'd pay you. It sounds like you wouldn't be losing that much!|`|5vgnrvcmaa	He's yanking you around and taking advantage of your kindness.<br>  <br>  There's an old saying that goes something like...<br>  <br>  "Before you lend a friend or relative money, decide which one you'd prefer, because you either get the money by unfriendly terms and lose the friendship, or you get the friendship and lose the money."<br>  <br>  Good luck, put I'd put it at a loss and get a new friend too.|`|SNC58uQvaa	Small claims court is an option.|`|a7cae049cc6badad134a60f38ca288b4aa	yeah, he's definately ignoring the fact that he should pay you back. do something about it, tell him you desperately need it.|`|AA10481071	nobody ever paid me back that I loaned money to.   borrow means keep for most people|`|OlIGqmMNaa	I know exactly how you feel. I absolutely hate it when people do that! I have had similar experiences. I think the reason why he doesn't pay you back is because he is just being selfish and it is really hard to talk sense into people like that. Yes you are right, he should've payed back with the first money that he got instead of buying snacks. It seems you've already done quite a lot to try to get him to pay back, so at this point the best thing to do is to sit him down somewhere and talk to him. Ask him straight out, why he isn't paying the money back. Tell him he should have given the first money he ever got to you, and devise a plan that will make you happy. He definitely isn't forgetting to pay you back! He just wants to use it himself. <br>  <br>  You need to give him an ultimatum. Remember, don't ever feel bad asking him for the money, because it is your right to ask and demand it. I hope that this works. :)|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	I will tell you this once and once only - consider money given as a loan to anyone a gift, 9 times out of 10 you won't get it back. Many friendships have been lost because of this. Many family members have never spoken again over this. Learn from this, and never loan ANYONE money again. It will save you a lot of hassle. If they haven't got the money, its up to them to wait and buy whatever they want when they get some money. Its not your problem.|`|NEWbh3Plaa	Just keep bringing it up. That is the best way to do it.  It is only $30 so I wouldn't suggest taking him to court.  Every time you see him ask if he has your money.  Tell him you really need it.  Eventually he will get tired of you hounding him and give it to you.

FtyLwqR5aa	She sounds like she is very bitter about something or someone.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Sounds like a description of someones psycho ex-girlfriend...Are you sure this doesn't describe a mental patient?  or perhaps someone that needs to be medicated?|`|hYZIYla0aa	She knows she's hurting someone,don't let her full you or anybody else.What a devious person.You need to get rid of her.Women like this never change,they just play the part better. One day it will come back around,but do you really want to be around waiting for it to happen?If you see it in her eyes ( the evil that is )then she is the wrong person  for you to be around.The eyes are the window to the soul.Keep watching,you have already seen what she is capable of,I would be scared of someone like that,Your next sweety,trust me.|`|62gMbgb1aa	Just treat her the ine the same ways she does, make sure you make her feel the same.
pOwOYqhEaa	hire a mexican caterer for the food. The colors are kinda bold so maybe you can just use the red as your accent color. Spanish music mixed in with the music you like.|`|hkwBR1moaa	I sure hope your fiance is Mexican because this does not sound like a good idea at all.  I think the colors together are tacky and so is the decor for a wedding setting.  <br>  But if you insist on doing this, have your bridesmaids where those ugly Mexican dresses with all the ruffles and the guys where ruffled ascots.  For your first dance or bridal party dance, shake maracas.  Instead of having a grooms cake, have a pinata and ya'll can break it.  Good luck!|`|5FEVLTufaa	colors like red, yellow, green, orange, generally just bright colors. <br>  food like rice, beans, tortillas, fajitas.<br>  Music well a mariachi band is all i can think of<br>  pinatas, mexican candies, etc. all this can play apart of it. <br>  Hope its a great wedding!!!|`|sFCfTfntaa	Papel picado is traditional, check the page below for ideas.<br>  Menu wise, nothing says mexican wedding than serving mole with turkey or chicken, rice and charro beans.

ZNe6B9TQaa	Just because someone called you beautiful doesn't mean you have to be with him.  If you really loved your bf, you would just stay with him and not be flirting with other guys.|`|iwIrQ4ncaa	stop talking to the other guy, and let your bf know that it would be nice for him to say that your beautiful once in a while, that should solve your problem.|`|kxmx1BvTaa	Your bf never called you beautiful?<br>  <br>  Oh my god.<br>  <br>  And why are you still going out with him?<br>  <br>  Dump him!<br>  <br>  Go out with that guy that REALLY LOVES YOU.|`|AA10958492	Oh gosh I was in the same boat not that long ago. I went with the other guy and am so glad that I did. I didn't realize until after the fact that my boyfriend (actually my fiance) really didn't appreciate me and often made fun of me. You should take a step back and think about what YOU want, what would make YOU happy. Godd Luck! Hugs!|`|ze4Gt1araa	I'll say dump your boyfriend hun, and get with the guy that calls you beautiful. You have to feel wanted and if he doesn't make you feel wanted than screw him hun you don't need guys like that. Forget that guy and start talking to other guy and date him follow what your heart wants it's never wrong.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|YFXusnT1aa	Who makes you feel special, there is your answer.|`|e488c78b0404e0d573309d30166d7451aa	Just think that many people say things like beautiful, pretty and stuff like that and they say it to everybody and do not mean it from their heart, it′s just a way to say things for them. <br>  Then if somebody is with you and cares for you and shows that he loves you, then you should really know what he feels for you.<br>  Some people think that these who always make compliments are the ones who love most... but soon they realize that they say compliments to every and each girl... no matter if she is beautiful or not really... it′s simply the way they are...|`|onrcmQf8aa	Maybe you're in love with the other guy because he saved you. <br>  or<br>  You could just be "needy" due to having a low self esteem recently and your current BF just doesn't know that.   You should let your BF know that you love to be called beautiful sometimes. Honestly, some men do not know.<br>  <br>  <br>  Please answer mine: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiVrY05mwGZkfHHBBxRwZ9Lsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222151649AAzjM8n">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|5DP859Gxaa	If you really love you bf well then you wouldn't be having this problem.<br>   Feeling and saying are two different things.<br>  <br>  You like this other guy because he gives u an ego boost.

AfbjU9Guaa	I'm the same, I wish I wasn't like that but unfortunately that's the way it goes. Friends, family & loved ones get an entirely different side to me than work colleagues or acquaintances do.<br>  Some people adapt to a situation a little too much I think - by that I mean on average people naturally change their attitude if they're in a professional environment, whereas people like me tend to change a little too much.|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	Well work is a professional environment and when she is home she is relaxed and her guards are down with you.|`|RsUEC74qaa	When in Rome do as the Romans do ...|`|QT0qTFyAaa	It has to do with sociology, psychology and human nature. Pretty complex stuff actually. At first your date, if she is interested will only show her best side to you.|`|hNCiw6Laaa	Why do people act different around other people...Most of us are actors when you look deeply into the whole scan of things???|`|0NwZPBgQaa	she wants to be accepted by everyone and if that means changing who she is then she will do it!!! no one should change just to be accepted!!!!|`|i4bjQbPcaa	She is not going to act all over you at work because it would not be professional.  I act differently at work than I do at home.  This is not a bad thing, in my job I have to act very professionally at all times as I am in a managerial position.  <br>  <br>  If my boyfriend came in to see me there is no way I would hug him or kiss him or have any personal contact with him as it is unprofessional.|`|dcEXQsiZaa	I guess they want to appear differently to different people. Some people do this to impress, others use the people (they are nice to one person but in front of another who doesn't like the person they are mean). Usually they feel as if they can't be themselves in front of certain people. Maybe around you she is nice, but at work she wants more respect??|`|3AXlgGgUaa	So you mean that at work etc she is a total b1tch but at home she is lovely?<br>  <br>  She is just being herself and being honest about her feelings.<br>  <br>  At home she is loveable because is happy.<br>  <br>  Maybe at work she is just doesn't care and doesn't care if people know that...<br>  <br>  I hate how most people act all nice and lovely with any old person they meet, its just bs.|`|ze4Gt1araa	That happens a lot with guys, well I think because she's just trying to show off and so other people won't notice that your relationship with her is really good. For the looks of it this girl aint no good, find someone who really loves you and won't be bi-polar that will treat you the way your supposed to be treated.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! :)|`|RDz4LmHDaa	as human beings we tend to act different ways around different people.<br>  some only act how they think others should visiualize them.<br>  <br>  for example i am silly around my family but im calm and collected around good friends of mine.pretty normal but it counts on the sitiuation.|`|AA10958492	Its all about impressing you and making you like her even more. Does she ever baby talk you? It is very common for women to do this as they feel it is a turn on for guys.|`|5sCpMpbWaa	yeah i also notice this in my friends, maybe they do this try to be better than yourself,|`|w6dXWoPzaa	because she loves you...not nayone else|`|DooJ5iDGaa	I would say , Psychological many people need to act different in order to fit into an environment . Some people don't have the luck to be in work environment that corresponds to their personality, and need to bring their attitude/personality down, or in cases up. Around other people they may become shy, or attacked and their attitude will turn to be in guard. That is why people act different around different places for the most part.|`|VCX7S3d6aa	She just wants to be accepted.. shes changing her personality for different people so that she fits in with them ! People that do this are usualy insecrue and scared of how people will take theyre actual personality but its nice that you love her actual personality for who she is ! its a shame she feels she has to change for other people if shes actually a amazing person !|`|mzQDUC5caa	hey man thats how my girlfriend is, maybe they're just trying to get attention from other people by being kind of wild and crazy. lol|`|F4kFUxd1aa	Sometimes the environment influences how we act because we try to fit in so much. just talk to her about it, maybe she's not even aware of it.|`|1nVRMObiaa	I guess she tells herself: "I'm better of with this one than without as I wait for the preferred one who may never come".<br>  <br>  I wouldn't love to be in ur situation ....
AA10151168	Make her see you with someone else..:))..Thus,you wouldn't be saying anything to break her heart.|`|SmNFiTkbaa	You shouldn't avoid her because that would really make her sad. You should just talk to her and tell her that now isn't the right time and that you don't want to hurt your friend by going out with her. Be gentle and kind to her, and just be very clear that you aren't interested and don't want to hurt your friend. You should say that you think its best that you two don't get involved. She should understand.|`|62cQv3z3aa	tell her that you  wouldnt date her because she dated your friend and you wouldnt do him like that

And if you are grown, move out and live your life and do not worry about trying to please her.|`|2ba40000b05c80f1026052730a2733afaa	If you are uni level, it is time you move out and start your life.  If there's a social or ethnic issue that unmarried women cannot leave home unless married, you are stuck unless you know your father will not honor the old system and force you to return.  <br>  <br>  I sincerely hope you are studying a profession at the uni that will allow you to live independently very soon.|`|m3UGI2BCaa	You are old enough to move out. That's what I suggest. Find some room mates, get a job on the night shift so you can still school in the day, and a flat where you can take public transport to uni. Split the rent. See if any of your friends from uni would want to do this, roommates splitting costs help a lot. Ask your uni about dorm rates too.<br>    Ask your father for a living allowance that is very close to what you cost them to live at their house. They spend money buying you food and petrol. Perhaps he'd be generous enough to give you a lump sum for such things and let you manage it on your own. If he says no, that's ok. Work. Move out. Be free and happy. You don't have to live like that.  If I was that unhappy, I'd cut the schooling to part time in order to be able to work full time.  It will take you longer to graduate but you'll still get there eventually.|`|trVubRitaa	take measures into your own hands. call the police if your stepmum is abusing you and your blind father. as for your father, there are many lovely homes for the blind and im sure that he can find true love if he looks with his heart instead of his eyes. good luck in your quest for the true meaning of life.

7edl5u1oaa	Before you get married, please learn the difference between VOWS and veils. A VEIL is a piece of lacy-like material a bride wears over her face/on her hair during the wedding ceremony.  LOL. I had to say that!<br>  <br>  But seriously, you don't HAVE to, I personally would probably go with traditional b/c i'm traditional myself. It just adds a special touch if you write them yourself.|`|LwjOKhgyaa	Hello, its Vows rather than veils - a veil is what a bride wears on her wedding day in her hair.  You can write your own vows, I think there are websites that can help you with it, just google it and see.  Or there are Pre made vows done by Registrars and Ministers, you can have a look at them before your big day - our registar has a few versions and we have chosen one out of them.  Hope that helps.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	How do you write veils ? I dont undrstand your question.|`|AA11603468	Some people choose to write their own vows, but most rely on the officiant to supply that.

AA10408380	Usually the girl and her parents have the most to loose if she finds her own guy. So they're against it. Plus, most ppl know the male mentality. So they think a guy will just seduce the girl, marry her, and once he's used her up, he'll let her go. He has no losses, and no one will support her since she did the "wrong" thing. But there are families of boys who are like this too. I've heard of stories. Plus, with love marriages, family and society aren't in control, the participants are, with arrangement, everyone else is in control, all they need is a firm yes or no from the boy/girl, or if they're too orthodox, they'll just pick partners for their kids n the last one to know will be the kids.|`|OHfZFR31aa	The main reason that divorce rates are low for arranged marriages has nothing to do with the couples working through their problems. It has to do with religious or cultural discrimination against divorced women. Many women know that if they were to divorce their husband, even if he beat her, she would not be able to survive on her own. She would be rejected by her family and her community. And since most of the women who are in arranged marriages are married young and without much formal education or any work experience, they don't even have the skills to get a job even if they wanted on. The streets of cities like Mumbai are filled with women who have turned to prostitution because that's the only way they were able to support themselves after leaving their abusive husband|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Because India still has a caste system.<br>  <br>  If someone is from a lower caste, he/she is considered less than human by people from a higher caste.<br>  <br>  Personally, this system is stupid and oppressive, and also a bit racist.<br>  But , it`s their culture.|`|y2Hrm4ioaa	Its Indian tradition to "arrange" a guy for a girl.In love marriage if the guy does have the same social status as the girl it worries the girl's parents.|`|QS6hSdZNaa	Religion and caste are very important to people from India....In their culture parents are compelled to take upon the duty of fixing a suitable partner for their children....if they are allowed to do so , they and the community will give all their support to the married couple....if the young men and women assume to select their own partners they are almost ostracized and no love can thrive in such an adverse atmosphere and the love marriage tend to fail.|`|DVmDWDC4aa	They aren't against love or marriage, they are FOR, choosing what they believe to be the right partner for their offspring.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, the divorce rate after marriages chosen like this are MUCH lower. Maybe decisions based on rational thought and information, rather than lust and impulsive love, are the way to go?|`|IXskJPlVaa	It has to do with the cultural and societal heritage.

kzgmFekKaa	￡40??!!! Man I would love to have ￡40 :P<br>  <br>  But, that aside, the absence of your money is quite troublesome. There is probably a 10% chance it was an accident (e.g. they unzipped it looking for something (in a non-deceitful way), maybe it fell out then?).<br>  <br>  But I'd watch how both of them act. The whole leaving a ￡10 note idea was good, but that requires somewhere to hide (and it also requires the willingness to just give up ￡10 like that, something I wouldn't, especially as ￡10 is equal to about $20 Australian which is still a big deal for me :D).<br>  <br>  To tell the truth, I had the same thing happen with me (but with only $20 Australian), I just forgot about it and became more wary for the future.|`|3d9513bff802e1bb1c92ea294d374e25aa	Real friends do not steal from each other, in fact a real friend would probably give if asked.<br>  <br>  Make them not your friends any more!|`|E83Ma37Xaa	Take a large run up and swing your foot directly up their anus.<br>  Then i would spit on their mother but thats just me y'know?|`|764Bqa93aa	good idea, temptation will get the better of them, <br>  set a trap and see who takes the bait, but it wont work if they are both their, <br>  <br>  one thing you can do is , have money in your pocket, and grab something out your pocket, and accidently drop your money infront of her, act like you didnt see and see if she picks it up and gives it to you or keeps it, <br>  <br>  BUT you might have to wait a while, never touch a stove when its hot, you will get burnt, let it cool and and you will forget it was ever hot,and so will they<br>  <br>  not entirely true, it could have been them both, maybe not, but then again its a possability, how honest do you think they are?|`|EjyD1sXeaa	keep friends with both and set a trap individually.<br>  leave 10 lying around and watch and wait|`|gJE0ujbzaa	while it's entirely possible one did steal from you, are you SURE it was there?<br>  <br>  I had this happen to me a few years ago.

I would take him for what he is:  In other words, he may not be that serious about you.  If you don't trust him, it's time to back off a bit. Why isn't he taking you out with him on the weekend??  He needs to give you some quality time and if he isn't, I would certainly suspect something is amiss.|`|3d9513bff802e1bb1c92ea294d374e25aa	If he felt the same way, you would already know.|`|bld4u9Lcaa	I know how clique this is going to sound and you're probably going to want to go DUH! - But you need to speak to him =]]|`|yCBpl2Jgaa	With your past experience you obviously dont have enough trust him to let him out.

Younger men do not stay with older women. Older men will marry younger women because it makes them feel like Mr. Big Man, but a younger man will not want an older woman in the long run. He will want someone young, firm and beautiful -- younger than him -- so he can be Mr. Big Man. Doesn't matter how young you think you look. He's still going to wake up some day and realize he's in bed with his mother and run for the door, leaving you alone with all those wasted years.|`|houWY7qvaa	An 18 year old hasn't even experienced life yet, let alone start a long lasting meaningful relationship.  If your only out to have fun, go for it, but down the line either you or he will find less in common with each other.    There are relationships such as these that work, but in extreme cases.  A very mature 18 year old who has had loads of responsibility added to his young years, and a younger acting, though wiser 34 year old who knows what they want in someone already.|`|mefxIQP9aa	Gross.

The difference in age in this instance adds up to a big difference in life experience.

You have had a taste of both good and bad relationships and you know the difference. He, however, does not.<br>  <br>  His innocence and inexperience in life is what makes him so attractive. At that age, there is no emotional baggage he can drag into a relationship.<br>  <br>  Iam certain it feels right and there may be a strong chemistry, but the bottom-line is--it's selfish on your part. There is the possibility that a man of that age can be robbed of his youth and denied the life experiences he needs to develop and grow into a man. <br>  <br>  As good as it feels, the age difference will become a problem, simply because he is inexperienced. Iam certain you care very deeply for this young man, but you do know better and no matter how good it feels, you really are doing him an injustice. Think about his future, not yours.|`|gjtdLPIYaa	. even though he is consider an adult he is still a young child. and even though age is just a number i think this is sick. find someone near your own damm age. disgusting. leave him alone and let him find someone close to his age. it's already hard finding a mature guy at that age without you old women trying to take them all<br>  <br>  Who cares if you think that you look good what the hell does that have to do with it. and just because he has been in a long relationship does not matter. you r still to old for him|`|nv7Cofm5aa	It doesn't matter, really. If you think about it, it's a good feeling... knowing you are attracted to someone younger than you. I'm 27 yrs old... and have been attracted to women in their 18's-22's. Obviously, they were attracted to me as well... but I often told myself... "does that make me a pervert"? In the end, it's really about attraction... and that I shouldn't let 'social conformity' get in the way of how I felt. <br>  <br>  Quite frankly, people are afraid to take risks, like yourself. People will say that your age will matter, but that entirely depends on you. Moreover, people stick with their own kind... because they fear the unknown. However, I appreciate your differences and how you have stood up for this. It shows, that not only society has control over your decision to be who you are, but that you know WHO you really are. <br>  <br>  I think we live in a very boring world... trying to fit in like everybody else.... on the same level when it comes to love, values, and beliefs. Look at everyone around you... look at how often these people marry people like themselves... still unhappy (but I don't speak for everyone). <br>  <br>  So all in all.... if you both feel you want to take this risk... then go for it. Just be ready for some backstabbing coming your way. If you can deal with that... then you can deal with anyone. Good luck and godspeed.|`|vjijiJT3aa	Just don't go on maury, I don't know how serious it will or can be because age is just a number but you have experienced life in double the amount of time he has your views on life will be very different when it comes to mature situations.

When he starts going through his 20's, he is going to be at a completely different perspective than he is now. Personally, and this is just me...I would be ashamed of dating a 18 year old at that point in his life, no matter how mature he may be. The mature part of myself would warn me that he needs to discover what life is like as an adult before imposing myself upon him. <br>  Unfortunatly. he can not do that under the wing of someone old enough to be his mother. Which, you are. <br>  <br>  Of course the date went way different. You are an adult and have lived as one, he being just barely an adult isn't going to have the same world, political and sexual views that another adult would. He's going to jump in head first and then regret it later, no matter how much he thinks he wont. That's life. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying your wrong for admiring an 18yr, but I am saying if you decide to pursue a relationship with him, your as good as robbing him of his chance of finding himself, of finding his place in the world and of being able to experience life from the perspective a 18 year old would.<br>  <br>  <br>  Re: <br>  First off, he's been through alot...he works, he doesn't have to be told what to do...I AM firm, and BEAUTIFUL! Believe me, I don't look 34. WE DO have a lot in common, we both play in bands and skateboard and love tattoos. And it's not just about sex, YEAH WE"VE MESSED AROUND,BUT WE HAVEN"T HAD SEX YET. He has been in a five year relationship, he's VERY mature for his age.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~ Let me just say, that just because you don't look 34...you are STILL 34! You're only thinking about what you are wanting/needing not what is best for him. Maturity has nothing to do with the steps we all go through into adult hood, it just changes how we experience them. As a developmental psychologist lacky, I would definately tell you to reconsider this relationship. For him and for you.|`|AA11452969	im 21 when i met my fiance. now im 24 and he's 42.. i never thought of having a man in my life with this age gap. but love is really unpredictable and unexpected. we both didnt expect that we will find eachother. there's such unexplainable chemistry between the two of us and that speaks itself.

We got married last July.<br>  <br>  No problems AGE IS JUST A NUMBER but remember you have already gone through your 20's and he is just starting. So your outlook is going to be a lot different then his. He hasn't experienced a lot of things you already have so keep that in mind when persuing a relationship.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|214621b9e16728aa03fa904b0f6c597daa	As long as age doesn't matter to both of you; there shouldn't be any problems. You just want to make sure he is sure about you considering he is younger and probably doesnt have as much experience as you.|`|QjbCgD5maa	If you are both happy, and his mom is okay with it, then you should both go for it and make yourselves happy.|`|4or0YDvIaa	Gurl I don't think there is anything wrong  with that. Im 17 and I date a 33 year old we been together for 2 1/2 years. Love has no age. your grown and so is he so enjoy yourself|`|6zfpexuIaa	totally>> he's too young for you. am 19yrs and cant date a guy younger than that....|`|QsC3qGkOaa	too early to tell, people do change<br>   try it then if it works then you are right.. good luck to you|`|VCX7S3d6aa	You only live this life once.. if your gunna go for all this sh**i**T you might as well have some bleeding fun doing it ! go for it girl.. never worry bout what everyone elese thinks.. what do they know ?|`|n5TwQt9Oaa	i personally think age is just a number, and if you really like him then go for it!|`|yjoHJcHUaa	as long as he will still love you when your older and yeah you get my point...|`|tKjSWha2aa	wow|`|kgIccwR0aa	enjoy every min and sec|`|FJlCys0Gaa	There seams to be alot eof idiots on this site today.<br>  <br>  Age does not matter.<br>  <br>  However 18 is still very young.<br>  <br>  If your happy together than that is all that matters.<br>  Be aware that all his friends are likeny to be the same age as him and although he is old for his age his friends may not be.<br>  <br>  Nights out with friends could be difficult.  you may feel very old when with his friends but on the other hand he may feel very young when out with your friends.<br>  <br>  My advice is not to rush things see how it goes and judge for yourself at the end of the day if you make eachother happy who cares how old you are<br>  <br>  x
Wrf5orAuaa	Take a nice bottle of wine and enjoy your dinner.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Take a cake to her place on her birthday or something.|`|eoQoCcz5aa	Myself one would let her pay for one more dinner but tell her about a new restaurant you have found , make sure you find the most expensive restaurant that you can dine in . Do make sure you indulge in fine food lots of fine wine and champagne and tell her that the next meal will have to be on you .<br>       Only joking your cousin isn't worried about you not paying for meals she pays for them cause she likes or loves you , but if it is a problem tell her how you feel , even tell her you went on YA cause it was on your mind .<br>            Kindest regards , cheerio .|`|5I7Ifrmraa	First off, clean your apartment.  Mold around the house is very very bad for you.  Then you can have your cousin over and make something very easy, like pasta.  If you can boil water, you can make pasta.  Also, pasta is very cheap.|`|vLJKNkNLaa	here is a simple solution:<br>  Take her out for espresso afterwards<br>  It is a cheap alternatiove to an entire meal.<br>  <br>  have it instead of dessert|`|FKqtAhjraa	Just show her that you appreciate her.  That's all most people want. She is there to spend time with you.  Take her for a tour of your campus I really enjoyed that.  Take her for a tour of your town. Especially if you know she has an interest in something,then show her what your town has like that. I had a friend that loves garage sales and thrifts shops, so I took her to all of ours. She was so happy. I love old buildings and historic things so when someone takes me on a tour of those things I love it, just an old downtown area is fun for me. When I was a student I would take someone for an ice cream cone. We had fun that's what is important.  Don't fret about what you lack. She might see this behavior and feel uncomfortable and think she is not welcome or that she is an imposition.  Just make her feel welcome.|`|AA10281393	You are very nice to be concerned but since it doesn't seem to be a problem to her to pay for dinner then it's probably not. You may want to send her a card thanking her for dinner and that you had a great time seeing her. <br>  Meanwhile, clean up your apartment just because your poor doesn't mean you have to be dirty. Some ajax (or Mr. Clean), a sponge, a lint roller, and febrezee (or just open the window) don't cost much. Elbow grease is free.|`|onrcmQf8aa	ONe day,  bring her a desert or something to her job.  Just to be nice, and surprise her.  But,  she enjoys your company - that is why she pays. So,  don't start standing her up or anything because you can't pay.|`|edCUawppaa	I think that first of all you need to clean your apartment (and wash your dogs)!!! Then invite her over and have finger foods. Im sure you can make sandwiches. Right? Then rent movies and talk.|`|4nWv0NRuaa	she knows your broke. offer to pay for dinner once you graduate so she knows ur not a freeloader. maybe she was a student before and understands|`|yAh2f59maa	You could simply thank her and give her a small gift such as a small book she likes or some chocolates (nothing fancy but something thoughtful).|`|3XZxr101aa	I think she is flirting with you, next time: give her the rod|`|51H2omf5aa	Go for a picnic!|`|15it6Zyqaa	bring her flowers or give her cookies|`|4wo4aWJ6aa	she pays cause she cares about you, and most likely knows that you dont have money to spend like that! try telling her how you feel! maybe you can pick a thank you card or something like that! to show her your greatful for what shes doing! maybe you leave the tip instead of her!|`|waBq57jcaa	Well she knows your broke so just say Thank You and how much you appreciate her generosity. I am sure Thanks is enough. She sounds like a nice person and Thanks is all she wants. Don't forget her birthday and Christmas that's all :D|`|VlxBs9zyaa	free food.
3eKLnP3Caa	really, i think you're just looking for someone to help you get over the break up, I had the same situation pretty much a couple of years ago, and i decided to try a relationship with the guy that i met at the previous summer camp cuz  we got along really well, adn well, it didnt turn out that great, and it's only by a miracle that we're still friends, but really it completely chanegd everything between us, and it especially was hard cuz we were  long distance, i mean different states, so i would say, if u realy trust this person, and you get along iwth them, perhaps just confide in them about the break up, ask them if you can vent to them, it'll be a lot easier, and you get over things quicker, and it saves you from a big mess and losing a good friend.|`|7cc79a266014247b9d92e937afa5e984aa	crush... You should talk to her and get to know her =) Good luck|`|AnfbrZFuaa	First off, liking someone is the same as having a crush on someone. And, you're the only one who knows how you feel about her. I would guess you like her if I was your friend.|`|K7vCWru6aa	You have a crush =)|`|OeRzlZPnaa	I think you mostly like her because you like who she is as a person (your good friends) and because you need someone to feel the void that your breakup left you, specially since it was a bad one. That's not to say that you two wouldn't make an awesome couple. Just remember a true relationship isn't just about the emotional aspects, although a good part of it is (well i guess in some cases it can be, but i'm doubting in yours). Another part of the relationship is the physical aspect. If you only have the emotional half and you can't achieve the other half chances are it won't work out and it's just a temporary thing. Oh and if you do decide to go for it, remember to take your time so you don't just have a rebound.|`|bld4u9Lcaa	Firstly, just because you don't think she is pretty, doesn't mean you don't have feelings for her. I think it could be close to say its fact that personality is number one. If she makes you feel happy then there can't be any other answer. When I say feelings, this could even just be a friendship. However, if you have just come out of a relationship you may not want another one and are just hiding from the idea of liking her in a romantic way but make sure you don't keep hiding. You've got to move on! But if you become sure that it IS just a friendship, I know how clique this is going to sound and you're probably going to want to go DUH! - But you need to speak to her and make sure she doesn't think there's more =]] Friendship is a sacred thing. If you both make each other feel good - treasure it.|`|UN7FwGHdaa	well....you need to think of what kind of girl you like.....sometimes you never know what you have until you understand what you are doing...some people say that you never know what will happen in a few years and you will never know if what you did was right or wrong...you may be feeling that you have no one to rely on and maybe she understands you even if you may not like her....
AA10378030	Be patient, he's just toying with you right  now...|`|hEcKmleVaa	Honey, reread your question.  You are in your mid 20's.  This sounds like junior high drama.  If any guy, for whatever reason, sent me an insulting email or VM, I would consider him GONE.  I think you really need to reconsider this relationship and decide if you want to continue this for another four years or more.  You haven't heard from him in four days.  He's trying to "teach you a lesson" most likely.  And yes, it takes two to get into a fight, but you need to look at the big picture and decide if this is really someone you want as a companion, lover, friend, etc.  Time is moving along.  Don't waste it.|`|tPMNAFbsaa	Unless he wanted an excuse to leave you, he will come back to you. Just be patient.|`|AA11356977	It should be obviouse that this long distance thing cant work. Your too young and are around others you are attracted to. I say let it go and focus on your life and enjoying it. Maybe you can hook up later but this isnt realisitic due to the fact that you cant physically be together.|`|yiUNN8ADaa	Wait it out, honey. Don't break down and bug him. Let him come to you. If he's really the right one and loves you and wants to be with you, he will come around. If not, he's not worth the trouble.|`|1nVRMObiaa	Get busy doing other things for a number of days ...|`|EDtcTBRQaa	Well you guys are both very insecure. He is also upset and heart broken he truly loved you. But he is scared to give you another chance and allow you back in his life. I know that you truly love him but if you leave him alone for a while he will come back to you when and if he is ready. Hopefully you will end up being together again! Best of luck and very sorry...|`|l9wTE5eCaa	He is ignoring you because you sent him way too many responses. You should just relax, take care of yourself, hang out with other friends. Because you emailed and texted him multiple times in less than a week, he doesn't feel the need to respond because you are paying too much attention to him. <br>  <br>  So, just forget about him for a week or two. If he responds, it will mean that he's ready to talk again or he's panicking because you haven't contacted him. <br>  <br>  If he doesn't respond, then that means he really did move on, so you should move on too.<br>  <br>  Hmm... go watch He's Just Not That Into You. It will make you feel much better.
GgVufxlHaa	On our wedding day, I gave my husband a book with important moments and pictures from our relationship that said how much I loved him. He loved it, and it was a great memento of not only our beautiful wedding day, but also the time together before we were married (though being married to him is ten times better... ;) )   Something sweet and sentimental like that on your speical day will really show her that you care and that you're thinking of her. Maybe include a nice piece of jewelry (my husband got me a white gold locket with a picture of us inside) if you want to go above and beyond what she'll be expecting. Congrats and good luck, and bravo for trying to be a sweet husband. She's lucky to have you!|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	My husband gave me a beautful pearl necklace the day before our wedding.  It was a wonderful gift, and I love wearing it!!|`|CHCPnvksaa	Have the inside of her wedding band inscribed with something short and romantic like "From this day forward" or "Sealed with a kiss"|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	You could always get her a few hours at a spa for a massage.  She (and you) needs to relax on your wedding day.  Of course, you would need to let her know about it beforehand so she can plan around it but it would still be a very nice surprise for her. Most things should be taken care of by then and she should take at least a few hours that day to relax and be pampered.  Congratulations.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Hmmmm........ possibly a bad idea.  Lots of stress on that day, does she like surprises?  She may not appreciate an unplanned "surprise" on "her" wedding day?   Wait until the wedding night and surprise her with something lewd?|`|xFv6LirIaa	How about a gourmet gift basket that you can both use on your wedding night with gourmet food or maybe even relaxing bath stuff since she will probably be so exhausted from planning everything.  That would be a thoughtful gift.|`|t9KytOdgaa	A pair of earrings, a necklace, or a love letter are all good ideas. Congrats on getting married!!!|`|V2BlnZf0aa	Anything hand delivered to her on the morning of the wedding with a note telling her how you really feel.  It can be something that means something to the both of you.  Something you have kept from your early dates perhaps or something she has mentioned in the past.<br>  <br>  I told my husband early on in our relationship that I loved the way JR always gave his girlfriends diamond bracelets in velvet boxes.  On our wedding day, the best man delivered a velvet box with a diamond bracelet in it that I wore on the day.  It could have been anything, but he had remembered something I had said so many years before.  It is definitely the thought that you put into the surprise that will make it lovely.<br>  <br>  Congratulations x|`|6C5NDSBSaa	This is going to be hard to explain...Try getting her something that you know she wanted but forgot about. Maybe something she had wanted a long time ago but never got. I dunno...I think it would be sweet.|`|CWrrYlv3aa	How about some nice jewellery like a necklace, or a watch|`|YEHVu4tdaa	Get a tattoo that says "Always yours".|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	maybe fly in a close family membr or friend that otherwise couldnt attend?
vffZ3is4aa	Who sent you the papers? lawyer, court, him? write to the lawyer and ask for certified copies. write to the courthouse in the jurisdiction of the court or go to the county courthouse and they should be able to give you certified copies. <br>   If you have to get the papers from the guy, good luck. If you are dealing with the dr, a lab, or a hospital, good luck.
ftmmWpqbaa	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder?|`|aiRn2lQGaa	what kinda question is this? guys are nice b/c they want to be and are goodlooking according to the girl's tastes|`|l9wTE5eCaa	Uhm... because they can? I don't know what you're asking...|`|o9QqsgYGaa	idk
wpEoqEVXaa	It's understandable how you find this to be so very hard, it is an extremely hard situation. <br>  <br>  On one hand, it truly is none of his business what you did while you two were separated. The other men, the abortion, none of that is his business. Even if you two are trying to get back together. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, i can easily see how you don't want something like this between you two. A secret that makes you feel like you can't get too close. <br>  <br>  You need to really sit down and give yourself a full evening to think about it all. I don't think you should keep the other men a secret if he asks, i don't think you should lie when trying to have a relationship with another. If he does not ask, that means he simply does not want to know. It should be his choice if he wants to know or not. that isn't lying or hiding things from him, that's simply accepting what he wants. Men often like to "forget" that their wife or girlfriend was ever with another man. <br>  <br>  As for the abortion, that's something that no one else ever has to know about. That's only about you. I see at least one who is nasty over it already and she doesn't even know you. Over 2 million kids in the system today who have no family and will never be adopted. These people who are so nasty often have never adopted a child either. They preach but they don't do anything to help the children. These types of people also have no clue as to how hard of a decision this is for people and that it's never made lightly or without remorse. I can't imagine the pain one's heart must go through after making such a decision, but i know it cannot be easy. <br>  <br>  By not telling him, it's really not keeping a secret. You don't run and tell him every time you have a bowel movement or when you have cramps. I'm certain there are many thoughts you have had that you kept to yourself. This is simply one of those types of things. It's something you went through and it's something that is no one else's business. You only think you might want him to know as to help take some of the burden of it off of your shoulders. But, it won't ease you at all. No one, other than someone who's been through this exact thing, can really be of help. <a href="http://cpcforhelp.org/post_abortion_grief" rel="nofollow">http://cpcforhelp.org/post_abortion_grie...</a>  <br>  <br>  Your life may have always been messed up, but it no longer has to be. You simply need to go to some counseling and get some help. Find out how you sabatoge yourself and learn skills on how not to do that anymore. Seriously, you can change yourself. It's not that hard even, you just have to want too. Best of luck to you.|`|PXfUyd5aaa	Don't tell him, it'll only make things worse between the two of you.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	You know what, I would tell him.  This way, he will be happy that you are separating and will know what he is actually losing versus what he thinks he is losing.  I think a long talk with him will cause him to happily divorce you.|`|iMY2fgYdaa	honestly...I can't tell you what to do...but I would like to suggest you seek some counsling..you stated that your life has always been messed up..that seems to me that you have other problems besides this to work through...so find a counsoler and get in some therapy and work through old and new problems...you'll be a better wife,mother and person for it. <br>  <br>  I would like to add that I would see a christian therapist|`|bAY9j21Paa	to be honest, NO i wouldnt tell him, you already f***** up your life, and this other guys life for aborting a child! so no, dont f up your ex husbands life or your sons life. You son cuold of had a brother or sister and he might never forgive you for aborting it.|`|vyNlyfczaa	Don't tell him... Honestly is very important in the relationship but there are some things where is better to remain silence....|`|qXkTatLMaa	I'm sorry that you are hurting.  i understand that this is a tough time for you.  I do not think that you should tell your husband about the relationship or what happened.  You are going to have to forgive yourself and leave that in the past.  What if you tell him, and you end up divorcing anyway?  Then nothing will be resolved and you will feel even worse.  Try to work on the relationship with your husband, so that you can out your family in tact, and move on from there.  I really wish you the best.|`|vWPq8nS2aa	Listen, you had to make a choice. <br>  If you didn't pick a side, you still would have been <br>  picking one. If having the baby aborted was the only option<br>  that you saw, then you made the right decision. Although i don't think you did or you wouldn't be second guessing yourself. I think you Just <br>  need a friend right now. Just think about things for yourself, and clear your head. best of luck.|`|0UUDFxR0aa	You have a lot going on right now.  First you need to deal with the emotiongs of having an abortion.  Second, you need to give yourself some room and time to really figure out if you want your marriage back.  You might need to talk to a counselor about these feelings you are having at this time.|`|TZpFcx47aa	Since you are working on getting back together, dont tell him. You want a stable life for your son and having 2 parents mentally anguished is not good for him.  Get some advice from a counselor or clergy but dont drag your husband into it. good luck.|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	If you were seperated then it shouldnt matter what happened. If you feel bad about it or whatever then let him know dont start a relationship with lies it will only get worse.|`|k7SOs18raa	first of all let me tell you that nothing is worth you getting an abortion...is too late now but you should have looked for advice before you did anything...when god sends something to you is because you deserve it and that child was supposed to be yours...now this is all done so there is nothing you can do about it just ask god to forgive you...as for your husband, well i dont really know but i will say not to say anything to him he probable was with other females while you were separated and you have no idea...you should only be worried about what you did to your son.//|`|nbfxnw9Yaa	Why are you trying to get back wth your ex husband anyway? you clearly dont love each other, you clearly dont love each other like you should do so just give up. Your sons already experienced the bad part in the break up an living apart so dont you think its about time to move on? <br>  <br>  You just said <br>  <br>  'I want my family back to the way it used to be i know that will never happen '<br>  <br>   'i just dont think we could move forward if im hiding stuff from him'<br>  <br>  Your contradicting yourself no wonder your feeling so depressed you dont know whether your coming or going. you want your family back but no it will never happen yet you feel you need to talk to him about it because you wil never move forward. <br>  <br>  Thnk its about time you realise you'l never have your family back the way it used to be and maybe its about time to move on?? <br>  <br>  xxxxxxx|`|xuiSfzgraa	I personally wouldn't tell him.  It happened during your seperation, so you weren't cheating.  And I think in the end it will be worse for you if you do tell him. He will probably not be ok with it, and you won't end up with your family back together like you are hoping for.  If you continue to have a hard time with everything, talk to a trusted friend or realitive who you know won't run and tell him everything you discuss, or speak to a counselor.
J9LZwAMraa	Its better that you break up with him sooner then later, i mean he may like you right now but i'm pretty sure he is not in love so it won't be such a tough break on him.<br>  <br>  explain to him that you don't want a relationship and when he asked you out, tell him you thought you were ready for one but you don't think you are right now.... You could also tact in there that you still want to be friends ( if you want 2 that is).<br>  <br>  Or you could just do it the simple way and just tell him its not really working out, and its better that you two break it off now, so no one is leading each other on.<br>  <br>  goodluck,<br>  <br>  Drew|`|JcwjDpY8aa	Tell him you didnt think it through and you have changed your mind.  Thats it. not complicated... you don't owe him a sob story .. you have only been together one weekend!|`|9gRikg8Kaa	get a hitman.<br>  <br>  LOL<br>  <br>  jk<br>  <br>  <br>  why dont you like him..... if you thought you did, maybe you do. get to know him more for a few days and then decide|`|u1Oi6tGHaa	You could give him one of the following cliche excuses:<br>  <br>  I'm just not ready for a relationship right now.<br>  I wanna work on "me" for a while.<br>  I just got out of a bad relationship.<br>  I like you as a friend.<br>  <br>  Or you could just be honest and say, "You're a nice guy, but I don't think we're compatable."  If it were me?  I would rather you just be honest.|`|swV3SIw7aa	oh crap i wanted help with a question like this too...<br>  well sort of not really..<br>  um sorry just talking to myself lol<br>  <br>  um just tell him nothing hard about it<br>  its not like your in love so it doesnt mean much<br>  just tell him (if you want..) that you just want to be friends<br>  simple|`|37ana68Haa	say hey baby im sorry i just dont think were gonna workout i think we should take a break maybe after i get my head straight we can go back out <br>  <br>  you dont even have to mean it just say those words itll work|`|2hyP31E9aa	seeing as how the relationship is still 'fresh', start distancing yourself a bit then just tell him that hes not the right guy and wish him luck on finding another girl. Again you two havent been going out for that long of a time so its not like you have much deciding to do.|`|l9wTE5eCaa	Tell him that it was nice dating him for the short time, but that you would rather be friends. <br>  <br>  There really aren't any nice ways to tell people that you're breaking up with them. So... just remain calm and use a nice voice. Make sure you are in a public place too, so it won't become a huge fight.|`|koI9459gaa	Just think how you'd want someone to tell you without hurting your feelings. Put yourself in that position. Basically just tell him you're not sure what you want, or you don't think its going well and that you don't want to drag him along because of your own feelings. Hope it helps.|`|2sgYribSaa	Just tell him that some things are going on in your life you don't think you can handle a boyfriend. (lie)<br>  or tell the truth, just say you think he is a great guy, just not your great guy. Get it?|`|cydakP87aa	just tell him honestly that you changed your mind. nothing is better than honesty. it might hurt him a little bit now, but eventually it will be better for him in the end.|`|zO59ezH3aa	There is no nice way to break up with a guy but just say these words. "hey I really like u but we would be better off as friends so......" and don't startdating another guy until he is over the breakup.|`|yiUNN8ADaa	Tell him that you enjoyed his company but at this point in your life you feel like being friends with him is what's best for you. Keep it friendly!|`|rZ9Oa5wfaa	Tell him NOW before it gets worse. This isn't fair to him and you're unhappy.|`|ix5Wmhy0aa	You've only been going out three days, so maybe you just haven't given him enough of a chance. Maybe if you stay with him a bit longer then you will remember why you wanted to go out with him in the first place, and want to stay with him.<br>  <br>  If you really want to break up with him, then you are right, it would be much better to do it in a way not to hurt his feelings. And soon too, because it isn't fair on either of you to stretch this out.<br>  <br>  Tbh, I think the best way to break it off with him would be just to tell him the truth. Nicely though :P<br>  Since you have only been going out a few days, you could tell him that you would just prefer to be friends, or that you don't want to spoil the friendship you have now in case it ends badly.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and try to make it clear that you still want to be friends so that he doesn't feel completely rejected.<br>  <br>  <br>  If this helped at all, could you please spare a vote for my school? <br>  The details are here:<br>  <a href="http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.html" rel="nofollow">http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.h...</a><br>  <br>  It'll only take a few seconds and would help me so much!<br>  Thanks x|`|TIHHbXySaa	This is what i would do....just tell him you don't like him they way you thought you did and that you don't think it's what you want but you would like to remain as friends.

AA10065812	???<br>  Before I even read the additional details I knew it had to be someone else as it's rare for non-custodial mothers to be ordered to pay child support.<br>  <br>  As for him being arrest, not likely in this economy.  The states are releasing non-violent and less violent prisoners due to decreasing tax bases, so sorry, he is not likely to be jailed.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	Yes very likely|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes you can.  However, jail is a last resort.  First you would have your tax returns siezed.  Next they would take away any license you have, such as drivers, fishing, or hunting.  Then if you still refuse to support your child, they can throw you in jail.|`|AA12004844	Yes, you can! They can also garnish your wages.<br>  <br>  As far as how far behind you can get - well realistically you should not get behind at all, but due to the slow response of our Court system it may take a while for them to catch up with you.  Beware though that they may tack on penalties and you will also have to incur other Court and legal costs - that will far outweigh what you originally owed.<br>  <br>  Best bet is to go back to Court and try to have the amount adjusted if you really cannot afford it.<br>  <br>  Even if  you are jailed the amount continues to accrue as well and does not disappear so jail really doesn't help the situation much<br>  <br>  Don't be a deadbeat - it sucks when guys do it to women - and it is just as bad when a woman does it - it's your child so be a woman and pay|`|AA11755944	he is in contempt of court and can be jailed.  it is up to the child support agency as to when and if they do that.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	yes a person can be arrested if it reaches the felony point, which varies on amount owed from state to state. i think where i live in illinois is $10 thousand.|`|7iIh5QmOaa	yes but timing is depended on how far primary parent is pushing issue. but a matter of time i suppose. not only can they arrest you they can take tax refund, liscense, leans on your property and will also affect your credit score eventually. so i suggest start making some sort of arrangements with childsupport enforcement. but you should pay it shouldnt feel like a obligation as much as a feel of want to take care of your children!|`|jBigEy0Caa	You sure can!  It is the right to receive child support, just like it is the right to have visitation rights.

TRUST ME. ive done it thousands of times and it's not worth the heartache.|`|2hyP31E9aa	If hes been a player all of his life but he is a 'changed man' i think its time he proves how dedicated he is, if he is living with you AND your daughter if you ask me he should be more focused on being a father figure vs a bf who scored a sweet place to stay and have his ex's numbers for a bootycall, and a password protected comp? i think its time he makes some personal sacrifices to show he isnt after all if he really cares it wont bother him
wia9SXCPaa	If you really love your wife as much as you say and you want to stay together then here is what you need to do.<br>  1. Find out what you must out her affairs (let me warn you the less you know the better off you will be because this will haunt you for the rest of your life if you stay with her)<br>  2.  Make sure the affair is over.  She cant see this person again and don't allow any contact.<br>  3.  Seek marriage counseling - your gonna need it.<br>  4.  Learn to forgive her as she must learn to forgive you. But never forget about the affair as that will lead you back to the same place.<br>  <br>  I tell you this because I have been in your shoes (I am still trying to get through it)  Both of us cheated.  The hardest part for me is trying to get the other woman out of my mind.  I know too much because I asked.  Now it haunts me.  I don't know if it is going to work out for me, if you want your marriage to work it is going to be one of the toughest things you ever do.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God Bless!|`|EJWphb88aa	if you love her forgive her and work on ur relationship... in the past she accused you of having an affair probably coz she was having one.. <br>  <br>  anyways its the past.. work on ur future... you have children n you both should set an example for them of being the best parents who lived with each other in good and bad|`|S2aeGQpdaa	you both need total honesty at this point before going forward. seems like she might have been cheating & accusing you because she was the guilty one at first.<br>  <br>  applying Godly principles will eventually help, but it will only work if you are both committed to starting over & rebuilding.|`|y4w6ybr3aa	I would be more concerned  if your children are yours and not his.<br>  Was she having the affair around the time she was pregnant?|`|UFOdwXgfaa	Marriage counseling !|`|PbwCVPL1aa	what goes around comes around.|`|U3RCBmKJaa	get over it you both cheated and confessed move on|`|dprURFLxaa	It seems to me that you both have a 'get of of cheating free' card.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Couples counseling is indicate, but only if both want to make it work.|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	What both of you need to do is start communicating. Let each other know your needs and wants. Then work to full fill each others lives. If I were you I would not try to find out more information about the past. You know each other cheated and that is all you both need to know. Hopefully, once the communication is started you guys can get through this. Good Luck!|`|gJE0ujbzaa	You can not "make" her confess anything. Nor should you try.<br>  <br>  What you should do is go to a relationship counsellor. For your marriage to survive, the two of you need to learn how to make it work. Obviously there are problems or you wouldn't be cheating on each other the way you are.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	She pushed you in to having an affiar ??? Plleeaassee<br>  we are each responsible for our own actions.<br>  you're both seriously screwed up. for the sake of your children, get professional marriage counselling|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Keep each other.  You have a marriage made in hell and no one else needs your baggage.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	First of  all, you and your wife sound like you deserve each other.  Why would you be surprised that she was cheating if your relationship was in a condition that you would cheat as well. <br>  <br>  Just so you know, your wife did not push you to cheat on her because of her accusations.  You cheated because you chose to, and you need to own that, just as she needs to own that she cheated on you.  You two have a tough road ahead, and unless you are willing to confess everything you did to your wife, then you shouldn't expect her to confess everything to you.
URZNtrxsaa	Hi Suzy,<br>  <br>  To my knowledge, there is no marriage contract of this nature that is acknowledged in this manner by Federal, Provincial or Territorial courts within Canada. If you would please find out in what Province or Territory this allegedly occurred, I will be glad to do some research for you.<br>  That said, I believe there are certain "First Nation", India (indian) as well as Chinese family customs/arranged marriages that are entered into by families. These are culture driven and typically, with the possible exception of "First Nation", are not binding by law. Does your friend belong to one of these culture or ethnic groups??? Has any money changed hands? If the answer to all these questions are "NO", then I concur with others who say this gentleman wants to eat his cake without buying it.....|`|pub2GLZPaa	The guy is lying. There is no such paper like that. How ridiculous!|`|rJJhMQ37aa	I think this guy is making excuses.  Any excuse is better than getting married, right?<br>  <br>  Seriously doubt that there's any legal reason, short of actually taking wedding vows, that could keep him from marrying now.|`|EvDmgWjvaa	What guys will say, no there is no paper you sign or contract that says you have to marry someone..<br>  If there was no court in the land would honour it and hold you to it.

As you are aware, there are a very limited number of Vietnamese surnames and Saigon is a very large and populous city.. It would be like trying to find a relative named Smith or Jones in New York City or LA.<br>  If he worked for the American Government or military before he left, you may be able to find out helpful information such as Next of Kin or home address. You can also try contacting a lawyer in either Saigon or the nearest Viet-American community.

pcjLTnwTaa	Yeah I do. It's not physical cheating but it goes against the trust and the fact that you are supposed to be his only girl, that is part of being in a relationship.<br>  <br>  I think you should confront him about it. He should defiantly not be doing that to you behind your back, or at all.|`|aAUeWJ5laa	I think that is, most likely, a form of cheating. I love how you came to get the opinion of others first though. He doesn't deserve you!|`|aJKpiFBlaa	dunno, guys just do that kind of things, even the nice guy. this hs kid on my IM list msgs. me and all he's interested in talking about is sex. i give him advice on how girls feel b/c he told his crush his feelings and she stopped talking to him for a bit. now that they're talking again, he continues to talk about sex w/me. he gives details on how he'd masturbate and press me on a naked pic. sometimes, a guy's d**k and mind are completely separated.
5VHWy0Ggaa	well from your story, this may not be the case, but it kind of seems like he just wants to have sex with you... i mean you two had a great date and all, but maybe you should just keep it at friends. i mean no one should have to have sex with someone to be their girlfriend. trust me, he kind of sounds like a jerk. but as you said, you are in love. i would wait a couple days, and call him just to talk about things. not that in particular, but just to see how he is...<br>  <br>  but i would suggest just staying his friend for now, especially since you might be moving away. i think that it's so dumb that he said you have to have sex with him to be your girlfriend! that is not right, and you're not ready, so don't give into him.<br>  <br>  you will find someone else, and that someone will not force you to have sex with him before he will go out with you... i know it's hard now, but things will get better, and you will find someone who treats you right.|`|h4CAYUvNaa	So basically you have his nuts in your hand if hes willing to give up his current girlfriend for you. That or he's just playing you both. You decide.|`|YaJaoNDlaa	He does not want you as a girlfriend because you wouldn't sleep with him?<br>  <br>  Dump him, please.<br>  <br>  If a guy is seriously in love with you, he would not only get you as a girlfriend, but also wait for you and respect your decision.<br>  <br>  Trust me, he's just not that into you.<br>  <br>  There is someone better out there whom would not break your heart like this guy obviously is.|`|HKkbqlIuaa	I don't know what the other guy was talking about, from what you wrote I don't see anything about another girlfriend. Anyway, I can understand him saying he couldn't love you yet because he didn't know you well enough. I really do, but I don't think that has anything to do with sex. He sounds like a douche who just wants in your pants. Sex should not be an initiation into a relationship, it should be a wonderful experience throughout the relationship. Well, good luck with everything, I hope it works out.|`|441002ba222c31246fd283fc8f2694bfaa	"He said he didn't love me because he didn't know me well enough and he said it takes a long time to love a person."<br>  <br>  He is a keeper. If he wanted you just to have sex he would have said he loved you, because that's the line that always makes a girl fall.<br>  <br>  Any man who values the L word like that isn't out to fool you because he doesn't want to say it unless he means it. He probably actually believes you need to have sex to be boyfriend and girlfriend, and he doesn't want to say he loves you because, frankly, he doesn't. It doesn't mean he wont love you one day, and it also doesn't mean sex will make him love you.<br>  <br>  Best bet is to keep dateing and see where it goes.<br>  <br>  Just the one line a quoted makes me think he is a keeper though.

When you lay your head on your pillow your thoughts start running around. Getting over someone takes time....and good people around you willing to help you. In my experience, I always say there is a reason for everything. The experiences that happen in your life are there to help you grow and understand. The only person who can really help you to get over something is yourself, with the help of people who love and care about you...your supporters.

All i can say is go with what you gut feeling on what you should do. that almost all the time is the right answer.

He'd be trying to get you off the pill if he wanted to get you pregnant that badly.  He might be a bit pushy and it's up to you whether you think it's too much or not.  Don't give in - you are obviously not ready for a child and the choice is really yours and yours alone.<br>  <br>  Clearly you do not really understand the pill.  If you are taking it properly - at a regular time every day, never  missing a pill and understand the times that it may be less effective (like if been taking antibiotics, been vomitting or you've had diarrhea) then it makes no difference how much he comes inside you, you won't get pregnant.  If not using the pill you are only fertile a few days in the middle of each cycle - a few days either side of ovulation.  If you are taking the pill properly you don't ovulate and you can't get pregnant.  Taken correctly the pill is 99% effective.  From personal experience, I used the pill for 13 years and never got pregnant.  Most pregnancies of girls that are taking the pill come from them not taking it properly.<br>  <br>  If you are really worried about the pill not working you could look at other hormonal contraceptives, like the Depo-provera shot.  You get it once every three months so you don't have to remember every day to take a tablet.  They say it's 99.9% effective but as yet there has been no reported pregnancies from women who get their shots when they are due.  The side effects are much the same as the pill, but it's less hassle, cheaper (about $15 per shot) and more reliable (it's not affected by other medications, like antibiotics, or illness, like the pill).  An added bonus is there is a good chance you will stop getting periods while on it.  In my opinion, it's worth it for that alone!  <br>  <br>  I think you are reading way too much into the food thing - after all, you choose what you put in your mouth.  Maybe he just really likes all-you-can-eat places and wants you to like them too.  As to the high-calorie food - he's a man and most men don't care, or even know and understand, about calories.|`|PbPiF2p3aa	I think it sounds like he would love to have a child but it does not sound like he is trying to trick you. He is probably trying to be nice by taking you out to eat. I would not put more into it than that. I wonder if he just wants to know you would like to someday have children with him. Also it is not real nice to say you would have an abortion. He I think would see that statement as a rejection of him. It sounds like he is a nice guy and you are paranoid. Be honest with yourself there are not many guys out there anymore who would want to stick around for the long hall of a family. Value what you have. 19 is to young for kids but he probably knows that and is just looking forward to a future with you. Good luck.|`|Ci2Q77E0aa	He sounds kind of pushy..i would be careful..  but you and him have a huge gap between ages..he is in the right time to have kids and you are fresh at of being an adult.. he needs to understand that this is your life and body..NO BODY has any right to force you to conceive a child or do anything you don't want to do. talk it over with him and tell him you are not ready..you have to get a life before making a life.

sbeoF50gaa	Hi, I'm OCD and have anxiety so I know how both of those can be. The OCD can be really frustrating all on it's own, but not having someone understand your frustration or the need to do the things you do can tripple that frustration. My daughter has OCD and her dad refuses to accept it. He says "That's just psycho babble" And he DOES yell at her when she does her compulsions. It pisses me off so bad! I tell him "Just let her do it, when she's older we can work on making her understand WHY she does it and work on it with her" Her psychiatrist put her on Tenex, which I thought was weird because that's for moodswings, but it worked! She doesn't do it AS much. Your school counselor might be able to help you, point you in the right direction for help. I'd also explain to him/her your problems with your parents not understanding. It's a shame that your parents aren't understanding or accepting of your conditions. Anxiety... I don't take meds for my anxiety but rather try to face it. Just do the things I'm afraid to do. Anxiety and OCD go hand in hand. I do agree that you should seek professional help because as you get older it can become worse. This is hard without your parents support. I'd keep a journal, I know that sounds totally girly, but it will help I promise. Once you turn 18 there are places available to help and give services for free, usually a pain in the butt process but without insurance it's your only choice. Here we have a place called MHMR. They take 3 months before you get to actually see a Dr. Do your parents have insurance for you? Would they agree to take you to see someone? Write letters to your parents about how you feel, and how their actions upset you... you can choose to give them the letters or not, and if you choose not to, you'll still feel better because you let it all out.|`|z1C75GIaaa	If your parents are not helping you the way they should then you need to go to someone that will. Tomorrow during school, go and talk to your counselor.. Tell him/her about what is going on with you and then explain how your parents are not seeing the behavior and don't understand. Your counselor will do what is necessary to help you and help your parents understand...|`|llT8Prtiaa	Okay, they will not listen to you.  Try writing them a letter and put all of yoyr feelings into the letter.  Put the letter some place where you know they will read it.  they should be able to find it in their hearts to talk to you after reading the letter and understanding how you are hurting and rreally need them.|`|AA11599430	they have to understand that you have emotional issues and that you would like to start seeing a psychologist. good luck|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	Well, if it helps any I feel very hurt for you! Please don't feel in any way you have to justify your needs to take showers are anything from your OCD you're not alone, lots of people have the same thing and do many different rituals and it doesn't mean your crazy at all.  Your home now and nothing can be done about it so try to just chill and don't worry about what's next until it happens. They probably never experienced any one with OCD and don't understand it.  When some couples are expecting they have all these grandiose dreams in this perfect world and not every one thinks of the realities and some seem to focus on them.  Unfortunately your parents aren't prepared for your OCD. Now the question is how to help them understand and I bet you can get plenty of advice from OCD people that have experienced the exact same things!  So go on and ask for advice and keep asking until you find healthy choices and answers.|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	I don't care how much your parents disapprove of your actions or whatever, they have absolutely no right to drag your emotions and self esteem down.  Shame on them.  I'm sorry you are putting up with that crap.  If it would help, talk to someone about it, whether it is a pastor or member of the clergy, a school counselor or trusted family friend, etc.  Hang in there - and again shame on your parents.  You don't deserve to be treated like that.|`|AosW4IvHaa	you need to do a better job next time.  Or go get counseling.
JFkcIdHxaa	Something small that is engraved can have a lot more meaning to someone than something big and valuable. This makes them feel like you actually thought about them when you were picking out the present.|`|cCbKTbzSaa	how  about  some  Jewellery ,   that is easily  transported .<br>    try  earrings  or necklaces,  or  cuff links.|`|AA11380378	I gifted my mother in-law a gold bracelet. My wedding was a beach wedding and the bracelet had gold strafish in it. It was fitting and she loves it.<br>  <br>  My father in law received a scotish silver pocket watch engraved with his initials. It was a true work of art.<br>  <br>  We spent $500 on parents gifts. I know that is a lot, but considering that they spent 10k on our wedding its was the least that we could do.<br>  <br>  Good luck
0Z6rqZ1Faa	I am exactly the same. I give the guy I don't really like my number cause any attention will do, feels good for the ego. When he calls I answer, I am flattered that he calls, I tell him I can't go out cause I am busy. Then he stops fussing over me, he doesn't call, he doesn't text, he doesn't email and I am all like OMG maybe I do like that guy. What is wrong with me that he hasn't kept chasing me and I have the answer to that question, its cause I am an egocentric b**ch that loves attention. I enjoy the fact that I am a little out of his league. I like to be chased and I justify all this by saying well I do kind of like his eyes or how sweet he is. I don't think its a huge problem and all women do it to some extent.|`|y4zYkceEaa	Maybe you don't like the feeling of loneliness. That's why you agree to go out with them despite having the feelings you feel. Just follow your heart. Go with your gut feeling. You're the only one who can answer that question. If you really really like him, go for it. Just make sure you're doing the right thing. I used to feel this way before. By all means, stringing guys along into a relationship you don't want to have is pretty low. I know you know that. ;))|`|56XwyVW9aa	I feel you are bored and would rather be with a guy you do not like than be alone. Also, it is SAFER to continue a relationship with someone than take the risk of being alone or getting rejected by the one you really want!|`|6mqA4uKbaa	Firstly, thanks for answer my question.<br>  <br>  I think you need to develop your own interest or life target, so that you won't need to repose your spiritual needs on guys.|`|klYCoFJVaa	Mmm... maybe you're still growing up in the dating department.  A lot of teenagers date people just because of hormones and stupid things like "hot hair" or whatever.  Personally, I don't date much, but have dozens of friends who date and shag like rabbits.  If you know you don't want that sort of relationship with someone, then tell them straight out it's not going to work out.|`|AA11266289	you answered my question so ill throw you my 2 cents<br>  <br>  its pretty simple, your just afraid to be alone, theres nothing wrong with that, i hate being by myself id love to have friends around 24/7
O0HrJO9Jaa	File for divorce and have her served...|`|AYfJWQuTaa	Getting drunk, never a pretty sight is it?  You deserve much better.<br>  She may get dependent on alcohol, so may get worse or unlikely to change. Hardly fair on children seeing this either.<br>  Make a clean break & find yourself a loving, caring lady; one who you can talk to and who is a friend as well as a lover, of course you deserve happiness.|`|kprKXEOSaa	Wow, you would call the police and have her forcibly removed from "your" house, with your kids right there watching?  That is child abuse, in my opinion.  <br>  Maybe you need to move out.  She'll probably get the house in the divorce anyway, right?|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	divorce. your kids will get over it. your wife is a useless btch. and i hope by "needs" you arent just talking about sex...|`|13353fcc774ebbeac5a1b4f512369b49aa	Your wife sounds like she is in a state of depression. People act on this differently. Some sleep more, some find things to bury themselves in like work. She doesn't sound like she wants to leave you, only that she doesn't know what to do, or how to deal with her situation. <br>  You are doing a good thing by being the "good parent". Obviously this is something that will effect your whole family. Being a child from a divorced family I can honestly tell you that it will effect you for years. It's been 33 years since my parents divorced and I still hurt because my family was destroyed. So don't stop doing what you are doing for your kids. They will appreciate it forever.<br>  There is hope for you. <br>  This is not "your house", but your families house. Your wife needs love, understanding and help, as do you. But as a man you can help her most by loving her unconditionally and helping her get to the root of her problems. Do this with counseling. If you are the problem, so be it. Change what you have to. Your marriage is the only fulfilling thing you can have for a lifetime. Even with all the ups and downs.<br>  Contact a group such as Focus on the Family. They will deal with EVERYTHING. Psychological, spiritual etc..<br>  Good luck. I have been on this journey before, so I am speaking from experience.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	News flash: the police will not remove someone from her home without a court order.  You can't get a court order unless you at least start a divorce.  You do not have to talk with your wife about divorce in order to start one.<br>  <br>  I find it disturbing that you are "playing" the good parent.  You should BE a good parent whether your spouse is a good parent or not.  As a matter of fact, if your wife is really as bad as you're making her out to be, you had better be prepared to take full custody of the children, in which case you'll have to parent them without anyone around to treat you like poop or in any other way.|`|VoPlVeOtaa	Get a life!! Been there and done that. Obviously she thinks u can not get anyone else.

AA12322526	I used to have the same problem many years ago. <br>  <br>  I started by just a quick pat on the arm as it's so non-sexual and doesn't invade personal space as much. Eventually I graduated to quick hugs, and now I can hug easily and with real affection. <br>  <br>  I don't have much trouble being demonstrative now, though I need a bit of space around me most of the time. Don't like people standing too close when they talk. I am very affectionate in a sexual relationship, but it took me a while to show affection to friends/family. So I understand where you're at, I think.<br>  <br>  Everybody is different. Some people are very touchy-feely and some people reserved, many of us in-between. Ease into it gradually so as to test for these differences. Some people will very much appreciate your affection, while others will be uncomfortable. The simple hand on the arm is a good place to start.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are afraid the girl you have a crush on will pick up on it when you touch her. Maybe you should talk to her about your interest instead and tell her. It's a risk, but nothing ventured, nothing gained. If she responds well to that, I'm sure she will welcome a hug and something more! You might be holding back physical affection more out of sexual tension?|`|S4HUVnzkaa	How do you start touching people without coming off as a creep?<br>  <br>  You can't.
2vgbJhlRaa	it sounds like your already in head over heels for her...dont try to force yourself to NOT have feelings for her. if shes shy and your the only guy she talks to then shes into you too. it doesnt matter what her parents think, you have to remember if you live to please everyone you know....then where does that leave time for you? why do you think she wont talk to you if she knows you like her? did she say that? or are you assuming that? you have to realize girls are just like guys they get embarrassed too! just be yourself. best of luck :)|`|9nOQlbwEaa	Well, treat her like your own sister, care and love her the way a brother love the sister, and also let her know that you wanted to treat her as sister, or take her as your god-sister.|`|QFpXZJhPaa	you can't stop it. it just happens. there's nothing you can do.<br>  friends is good. <br>  <br>  but how do u know she won't talk to you?|`|YCUJMvWQaa	start talking to other girls so you can get to like them...but that doesn't mean to get rid of this girl it simply<br>  Means to set yourself aside from her once in a while :)<br>  <br>  Hope<br>  I helped some|`|eM3tXyqBaa	I also has the same problem but slight different on the situation.

GqTSa85daa	You're his security blanket, not your love.  Leave him, he's a loser.|`|angW1Lkfaa	Because he doesn't want you to kick him out and have to pay child support. If you can't say it I will you picked a loser. does he really love me, yes and everyone else he can do. there I said it.|`|CqJ1UQWiaa	It seems to me like he doesn't treasure your relationship like the way you do. I feel like he's not taking you seriously. One minute leave, then the next come crying back. You need to weigh out which is more important to you, letting your 2 yr old son have a father or you to have a better life. If i were you, i'd leave him. There seems to be no security in your relationship. Tomorrow, he'll probably leave again. then he'll come back in a few. Then a month from now, he'll be back again. And so forth. I'd want something more permanent and someone who takes a relationship seriously and not take advantage of it.|`|qxgkhN8aaa	Hi Trina, I've said that 19 is not a good time to have a baby.<br>  And are the both of you officially married ?<br>  What about child support issues ?<br>  What about his parents, do they have anything to say about this ?<br>  Forget about his issues and focus on the child right now,<br>  make him share equally for everything regarding the child.<br>  Don't he have any responsibility to the baby ?<br>  Oh! and did he have a job ?<br>  <br>  From here onwards, make sure you get all the facts from him correctly,<br>  no more hanky-panky and make him serious about this,<br>  he'll have to grow up somehow.<br>  Make him realize that he's not the bachelor anymore and he'll have to divide<br>  his time carefully to care for each other.|`|wGKBuipYaa	You are his comfort zone. He doesn't want to be alone but he doesn't want to be with just you. I know it seems harsh but you need to tell him its all me or nothing.Its not going to be easy but hopefully things will turn out for the best for you and your child. You have to admit its hard for both of you to be tied down at such a young age. But  you and your man need to work on this or its just going to get worse.|`|tbuNZqJsaa	Wow.. im 19 too and i could never imagine myself with a kid! lol<br>  <br>  Anyway, i'd say just kick him to the curb.. he seems like hes not respecting your wishes and hes just hanging around like a fly.<br>  Or, if a straight up break up is too hard. Talk to him! Make it straight that you dont want him talking to random women.<br>  Talk to him before one of his online female friends start to strip on Webby|`|y7PaRczqaa	ok now the reason y he cant trust u is because he is off doing something wrong, he is probably with another girl and he wants to be messing around with other women but he doesnt want to lose u, u need to find a way to take care of this now before it gets out of control..|`|lXBVrik7aa	Clearly, he is not a better person, ask him whats going on, why he wants to get back together, and maybe stay clear of him, he seems a bit dodgy to me.

dvNWbUgLaa	Where was he until 9 in the morning?  You have a right to know.  I would be thinking he was with another woman.  I hope that is not the case.  Maybe he just drank too much and passed out.  Just tell him you get really worried that something bad happened to him and you need to know if he is going to be late.|`|1cb3542838b379bb2f5a7c25c04d579baa	I would say this is unusual.  <br>  You should have a discussion with your fiance.  Explain to him you are hurt by his lying, and it makes you think you cannot trust him.  Tell him lying sets a bad example for the children.  If he cannot deal with this, you may want to consider moving on.|`|37803e6c4f82e6a134d585be72409c93aa	You may want to rethink the marriage because you are already having trust issues. In order for a marriage to work you have to be able to trust one another and communicate with each other and I don't see that here. Good Luck!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I'd be thinking, well, he's single and can do as he likes...|`|IHwMbLX5aa	Sounds like he was up to no good.., especially since he was getting defensive about it.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	It would be one thing if there were no kids in the house, and he went out on occasion with friends. That wouldnt bother me.<br>  <br>  But its not a good thing for kids to see that kind of partying and coming home in the morning. I would be thinking if he is the right person to help raise children. The fact that he didnt call or check in is not the issue here.|`|2XTkSV4daa	I'd be wondering why he felt he needed to lie to me twice-once about checking in on me and once about coming in later. So I would sit down with him and try to talk about it but be prepared for him to get defensive and kind of angry. If this is just a one-deal thing, maybe don't really worry about it, but if it happens more often, I think you need to have a new situation with this guy.|`|6TC0cjAgaa	ya know.. i wouldn't jump to conclusions.. I know it must be hard but try to send the kids to a friends house or wait till they are at school and sit him down and try to talk to him about your fears and concerns.. but let me just say..<br>  my fiance is 4 years older than me (we don't have kids though) anyways when he turned 21 (he'll be 23 tomorrow) his friends wanted to take him out to the bar and he refused because I couldn't go.. I'm only 19 and since then he's kind of grown up and decided that's not what he wants to do.. that the bar scene isn't for him!! I don't think that if you have kids together that he should be parting.. it's time to grow up and set a positive example!!! <br>  <br>  but that's just my opinion!|`|JAdNkzENaa	im going to be completely honest with you. <br>  <br>  do not marry this guy! <br>  <br>  best case scenario = he was having honest fun - doubtful - but i said BEST case scenario... why would he lie about what time he came home unless he was trying to hide something? and why wouldnt he have called you? <br>  <br>  Worst case scenario - which im afraid is more likely especially since this is the THIRD time he has gone out this month - is that he is cheating on you...<br>  <br>  a man ready for marriage and a family (whether or not they are YOUR kids) would NOT be doing this. i say break it off before your kids get even more attached. you have to think of them. he's obviously only thinking about himself<br>  <br>  edit: i read that the kids are both of yours not just yours - i just assumed they were yours only because you wrote you couldnt find a sitter for your kids - <br>  <br>  after knowing that, i think (and i know it sounds crazy) but he may be doing drugs and/or cheating on you. <br>  <br>  if this is not a normal behavior and he gets very angry when you question him i wouldnt doubt it. buy an at home drug kit and try to test him. if he refuses its probably gonna be dirty.

It can look very sexy if done right, I'm sure yours is. But, some guys may feel they look too much like a guy and this is probably the main reason as, most men are, homophobic. They dont want to be seen with a girl who looks like a 'guy'. Plus it's also what guys like in girls. Some find it attractive, some not. Plus, some men like to feel like The Man in the relationship, that is is he who wears the trousers per se. They think that girls with longer hair look mor Feminin.

You're 44 and still drink too much... hanging out with someone who drinks too much isn't a great idea unless you want to make your way to AA meetings...<br>  <br>  The younger guy who seems to have his life in order, may not want you back even though he may or may not have fallen for you.  Breaking up with the possible alcoholic won't really mean you can go back to the other option.  Nor should it.  Don't worry about how he may or may not have fallen for you and the pain you caused by leaving him.  <br>  <br>  My advice to you, break up with the possible alcoholic and don't date anyone until you get your life under control.  Eliminate the excessive drinking and the desire to be with someone who is a bad influence.  I'd say that would be a great start.  Be on your own for a bit.  Start fresh after you get control back.|`|AA10151168	I guess you are still in love with the first one, and sounds like another new one will be dumped for the first one. So if you decide who you really love or if you need a new one be honest yourself and don't make the people fall in love with you because their feelings may get hurt.|`|djUMvICoaa	Some of don't have issues, but I know how it feels better to have a lot of company.  Those of us who do seem to like to drink, that never helps any issues, it only makes them worse.  And it seems that is what you did, you made them worse.  Falling from one relationship to another and back certainly didn't help your issues.  It pointed out one of your issues, that you are not making an informed decision because your head is swimming with the mess your in.  You seem to like chaos in your life, the b/f, his clutter and when you fix it you clutter it up again by going back to him.  You need to take a break from guys for a few months and let the dust settle around you, get your head back on straight to see what is really good for you.  While you remain in the midst of this chaos your decision making is going to be clouded and you never will be able to make a good choice.  Anyone that's jumping from one relationship to another has the same problem and can never get it right because they are trying to let a man fix their issues.  They can't fix them, they only create new ones.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	I just find it ironic that the slob, alcoholic, irresponsible one is "conservative" and the liberal guy is the straight laced one. <br>  <br>  As to the rest of it, well there is a reason you are 44 and have never been married.  You & your lifestyle choices (who you date, how you live etc.) don't combine to make a stable relationship and you need to own up to that.  Chances are you like the drama.|`|LU7yg6Ejaa	you could try to grow up and act your age...christ im younger than you,i have a 20yr old way more mature than you aswell..lol|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	well, you dumped the first guy carelessly.  then the second guy carelessly.  <br>  <br>  what does the counselor have to say?|`|G50ucmllaa	So you are a cheating whore...that is best worked out with a counselor.
SPdo80YJaa	It's not a huge height difference.. Without seeing a pic it's a bit hard to say. But like you said, it doesn't matter what everyone else thinks. As long as you both love each other, who cares? Good luck in your wedding plans :)|`|sg93GVSJaa	yeh I would def take a second glance :)  but honestly I don't think you'd look weird|`|nC8GRKxhaa	yes, as long as u have confidence and love for one another you will be amazing. it isn't about image, its all about true feelings. you will be amazing if you want to be.|`|eT9cRbgFaa	this is a dodgy question!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! especially because you never added a pic! <br>  <br>  but um from the image i got i guess you look like an alright couple! <br>  <br>  id say it was weird if you were 2 meters taller than him!

I DONT KNOW!!!!!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!|`|Wa8x5UQlaa	I think the only issue here is that you're a bit taller, but that doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing.

HdQRETyQaa	To be honest i don't think you deserve her.<br>  You should never be with someone other than the simple reason.. that you want to be.<br>  Break up with her.<br>  But don't do it in a harsh way.<br>  Be nice about it :)|`|gLXzVbm8aa	does she like you? just let her know things are not working out,|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	Things would be a lot easier if you had taken all this into consideration before going out on a second date on Sunday that involved much exchange of saliva.  Why go out with her a second time so soon and swap so much spit if you weren't interested?  Back peddeling after getting so involved is messy, inconsiderate and immature.  Keep your lips to yourself next time and stop leading people on.  It doesn't reflect nicely on you.|`|AA10958492	Why don't you give it time? You may realize that she is quite an amazing person that you would pass up. If you later think that it is not meant to be, then break it off. Since it is so new, why not give it a try?|`|82bMFhs4aa	well if you dont like her just break up w/her nd go w/the girl you like..but you shouldnt have dated her in the furst place shes gonna feel bad but do what best for you..she can move on|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	Break up with her!

To me it seems like you already know what you want to do so...dump her.|`|LvoGawNTaa	tell her how you feel. you can't be forced to be with someone if you don't like them..<br>  but be nice when you do so.|`|f2ZNJy48aa	Dump her.

I'm screwed.|`|ATeyVYdOaa	It will always be True no matter if the girl says she is secured with herself! In the back of her mind she will envy the beautiful woman!

I am in love, completely, totally, amazingly, crazy in love and I swear since I know him I didnt even think of another man.

At the moment you find your other half, the world becomes perfect at a sudden and he/she will fill your life :)|`|72UNDrwkaa	i usually keep glancing over if i see a hot guy and then if he happens to catch me i usually give them a cheeky grin and hope they come over and start chatting xx|`|UdfYnHJ6aa	I don't know how you'd rate me but I personally try my best to accept people as they are.  I understand what you mean about admiring beauty and it is just that for me... admiration, in the same way I would stop to look at a beautiful flower.|`|K7vCWru6aa	Hmm..well when i usually see a hot guy, I blush and stare at him or look down immediately. If he looks at me i look away like I'm not paying attention. And when i walk by I try to laugh and smile with my friends, I'm not sure why. Hopefully he'll think I look cute or attractive.|`|b19JZTtnaa	i  smile and if the guy is hot smokin,, i laugh,,, and get blush, that's so funny i love it|`|paV2LdR9aa	Yeah I usually make eye contact and smile|`|bld4u9Lcaa	I know you;ve said you do this in the nicest way possible.

vfcD8Ic1aa	mine does too. maybe its because hes protective and really doesn't want to hurt you. try talking to him about it. tell him it hurts that he wont be hard and you really want it hard.<br>  try getting a little buff too. that helps<br>  i did it.<br>  and now my bf isn't as protective of me. he only likes to protect my stomach because he thinks i'm too skinny for some reason.|`|9aTgP4wVaa	Hmm...hmmmm...seems like he's tryna paint a picture for u...of himself...he cud be jus tryna show u he's so sweet & nice & caring jus 2 get to the cookie jar...or he cud b like that...like really nice...take a step bak...and look at em...really look at his...and!

Many of the guys look for their pleasures only not the partner. I am sure he will make your 1st time memorable and comfortable. Don't force him to be hard. Let him treat you he likes.|`|gywXHuGCaa	it's in our nature i guess, of course we dont want our loved one to be hurt...|`|gBJ7wr62aa	Not all guys are like that but it sounds like your bf just really likes/loves you and is afraid he may  hurt you if he is to rough in anyway..since he cares so much he treats you like your fragile why dont you tell him you want him to be less delicate.|`|uz43IgBLaa	He is probably the sensitive type. I dated a guy like that and tried to change it but there is very little chance he will change much. He might change a little if u really talk to him about it but i dont think he will really change cuz thats just who he is. <br>  <br>  P.S : I totally get how you feel.|`|wE2etBzbaa	Say thanks to him, instead of complaining that's just a proof some people never feel enough. do you want him to be rough and careless?|`|68PRp0BGaa	It sounds like he really cares about you and your well being.

UFOdwXgfaa	Everyone has their unique way of grieving so I am not in a position to give you a time frame.<br>  <br>  However, the one true thing I can say when it comes to past relationships is you never completely forgive and forget the good and the bad because it is part of a learning experience for you to grow from. For you to dream about your ex means just that, it was a dream.<br>  <br>  For you to still have feelings for him is a whole different story. Just remember what he put you through and those feelings will go away in an instant !|`|kKABnmbzaa	U have to make up ur mind that ur over him because if not it will drive up crazy. I've been in that situatution before where I was with a guy for 3 yrs and we broke up and it took me a while to get over him but once I made up my mind to be happy and move on it all came into place but it did take a while but you need to make yourself ready to move on with your life because he's moved on with his.|`|ALkhwI23aa	let it go sunshine find something to keep u busy    mildred sent me here to help you|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	What's really weird is why you even fell in love with an unscrupulous ****** bastid.

Because then you've accepted the hurt that may come your way.  He's not promising to be 100% committed to you, is he?  No, next!|`|f38daa37b1a29a4f31ff1dc5d2746334aa	if you like it go on....|`|Ks0BrqHBaa	well i would just stay friends for now. if he really does love you and doesn't want to lose you then he will make sure that he doesn't mess up and do anything stupid at parties. and honestly if he feels that he will mess up at a party then he shouldn't put himself in that situation to begin with.|`|8i7mg2VQaa	try, love is always worth it, even if your heart breaks if you never try you will never find someone to make you feel like your the only one who matters, so yea go for and it and i hope for the best XD|`|27ylepZLaa	Ah puppy love....<br>  <br>  Just try to hang out together and let the chips fall.|`|drEfr9waaa	Is he telling you he mightn't be able to be faithful?

2gQ6GGD6aa	Five months is really not that long.  Sometimes you have to just let that hurt run it's course, but don't let it own you.  Wallow for a little while if you have to, but then pick yourself back up.  Looks aren't what matter, though, they fade.  You get old and wrinkly.  The only thing that last is that connection you have with someone.  He left you and hurt you and so he wasn't the one for.  You don't put that deep of a hurt on someone you truly love.  If the man you're with is a good man and treats you and your baby good, then appreciate that, build on that, and don't look back.  We can only move forward.  And you really can't be sure if he'll be with her for the next 17 years.  If you and this new guy of yours hit it off great and are truly happy and your ex sees that, if he sees a happiness between the two of you that you and your ex might have shared, there is no doubt that for a moment he'll regret walking away.  An image may cross his mind of what he left and what he'll never have again.  Have hope, move on and make a new life.  Good luck.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	It's not being "stunning" that matters...it's being happy...you are obviously not over him and I doubt you should be in a relastionship already....I think you should concentrate on your child and getting happy in yourself.|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	Dont feel that you're being silly, its natural to feel this way, 5 months is a really short space of time considering you had a family and were together a long time. It can take a year or more to properly feel over the person, and thats what the problem is, you're heartbroken because you still have a little bit of feelings for him that you didnt even realise you had, you wouldnt feel the need to impress him with a stunning guy if you were really over him. You just have to ride it out, try not to think about him, the feelings will fade away eventually, focus your energy on your new fella|`|qDLT1eh6aa	Don't allow your child to go with any new girlfriends of your ex until after about a year, this girl may be a fly by night, and your child is going to be confused. I'm shocked your ex is introducing new girlfriends to your child.<br>  If your boyfriend makes you happy then that's the main thing, your ex may be dumped soon by this stunner! Let that thought comfort you!<br>  Cheer up ~ you are the constant one in his life that is going to bug the Hell out of his girlfriends :)|`|ghvU8CsOaa	Even if we all try to, it'll wear after you read our post. Feel the pain, don't stop thinking about it if it still haunts you.<br>  <br>  You'll be fine. Instead of thinking how stunning her new gf is, geez, appreciate the guy you are with who accepted you for all your baggages and issues. You will never see your new man's worth if you will keep cringing about your past.<br>  <br>  Grow up and get moving, you have a new life ahead of you.|`|ec9cd1a19bba30708d858894d59d9cb2aa	hi hun<br>  He's the looser ' just keep telling yourself that .he just wasted a number of years ' until the right guy comes along .|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Wow you are really quite shallow about your new boyfriend and his looks.  If you don't like him that much don't go out with him, you are basically stringing him a long because you want someone in your life and you don't really mind who<br>  <br>  You are not completely over your ex, instead of wondering about how this woman (who will possibly end up as step mum to your son) is with your son or whether you can be civil to her about the childcare for your son, you are more concerned about her looks.<br>  <br>  Get to know her and find out what she is like as a person.  I would be more concerned about the welfare of my son, than someones looks.

Sure he's mature and older, but he might also have children nearly your age, been married (or is married) or just won't have the same energy for you, or your potential children! In all honesty, anyone can get anything if they put their heart and mind into it but really sit and think about whether it is worth it. he's fortynow, but when you're thirty he'll be fifty and so on and so on and you've got to think about that too.<br>  <br>  In the end, no matter what, always make yourself happy.|`|De1tOxHXaa	that's depend on his character as only he knows what he takes this as childishness or something else,anyways the guy has got a good luck.

pVnUhYLQaa	No one can say whether or not you're a bad mother based on what you're saying here. I don't know how you've handled your daughter up to this point. If she said at 14 years old, "mom, I'm going out to have unprotected sex with Johnny" and you said, "have fun", then yes, you’re not the best mother. But if you feel that you've done all you can to raise her "right", and she went out and got pregnant, then that's not 100% on you. The "best" parents in the world can still have daughters who get pregnant as teenagers and sons addicted to heroin, there's only so much a parent can do, and eventually you just have to hope that everything you've taught them in life stuck, and they make the right decisions when they're out on their own. <br>  <br>  But now you're in the situation that you're in, and from what you're saying, it sounds to me like you're handling it the only way you can. You're being supportive and loving. As far as the baby daddy, if he's not an absolute low life, I.e. Violent, a drug addict, etc... Then I would agree with you, he should be involved. <br>  <br>  She's pregnant, the "damage" is done, she's going to get a crash course in growing up really fast. I don't know what punishing her is going to do at this point. She needs love and support right now.<br>  <br>  EDIT: With all due respect Nancy S, you're clueless. You are not telling the truth, you are making up a "worse case scenario". <br>  You are laying out all of the bad things that COULD happen, So how is that the truth?<br>  You know that she will get sick of her grandson, that her daughter will run around and get pregnant again, that the father will disappear, that her husband will leave her and that her kids will put her in a nursing home? you KNOW all of these things? These are TRUTHS?<br>  I'm willing to bet that you have no kids. And you're living in a fantasy world if you think that just because you've done all that you can to prepare your children for the world, that everything will be ok. That's just not the way it is. You can't be with a 15 year old 24/7, and no matter how well you prepare them, in the end, they are going to make their own choices. You don't know that she didn't teach her to protect herself, or even that she didn't teach her abstinence. She may have done all of the right things; but in the end her daughter will make her own decisions. So stop being so judgmental to someone that you don't know at all and about a situation that you are obviously 100% clueless about.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To the person that gave me a thumbs down; what did I say that you disagree with? I would love to know where you possibly found fault in my wisdom.|`|ILZY7BD0aa	Well i think your daughter is very young to be having a child.. But with all the help you  are offering her how can she lose.  I don't know you or your daughter. So I can't judge if she will be a good mother or not. <br>  I know that if you all work together and with all the other children there they can help with their nephew.<br>  You said you have other children .. <br>  God, I don't know how old you are, but I would not let my daughter off of her responsibility of raising her own son.  I would watch the child during school time.  Then she would have to raise her child.  <br>  I don't think your a bad mother, I think you trusted your daughter and did not realize she was having sex.. But now you will know what to look for.. But that's like closing the barn door after the horse escaped!  No pun intended.  We all have made mistakes.. The child is not a mistake.. I'm just saying it's a very young time for a girl to be exsperiencing child raising.<br>  Good Luck.|`|AA11599430	please don't take this the wrong way but how can your boyfriend blame you for your daughter being so sneaky . What might help is if you seek professional help to help you deal with your problems, good luck|`|bYtCfdwbaa	Yeah,you're making life real easy for her.That's nice.Way to learn a lesson.|`|Yg2iIneKaa	Well I guess Nancy S might have a few good points in what she said.. I think you are young yourself, and love your daughter... I don't think you're a bad mom.. I think you love babies.  <br>  I hope you love raising your grandson.  Maybe your daughter will learn from this and be more careful  during sex. <br>  I think your are blissfully wonderful..<br>  Hope your husband warms up after the little angel is born.  I hope you're a stay at home mom..<br>  And you can devote your total time to the little boy ,  hey your older children can also help..<br>  Nancy S you should be ashamed of yourself.. But them some of the things about safe sex are very true..<br>  God bless you and may the power of love guide you all.  You're a Great mother.|`|bYGx8xdVaa	your a grate mother believe me,not like ur husband just blaming others...ur daughter made a big mistake and its a half ur fault and ur husbands too.i dont know why young teen girls all have boyfriends these days.they r just making mistakes ... ok now u just have to wait for ur grandson and maybe one day ur daughter will make u proud but u have to work with her now very hard cuz its only 15 and she can change,hard but she can if u both want and ur husband...just keep waiting ;)|`|ygccpU2paa	Your husband is just as responsible as you are--and just as innocent.  Being able to control a 15 year old is just an illusion.  You can't be with them every minute and you can't chain them to a wall.<br>  <br>  Hire a lawyer now.  You absolutely should get legal custody of this baby until your daughter is old enough to make mature, rational decisions.  You don't want her to be able to just pick up and take the baby anywhere with anyone until she's mature enough to keep her baby safe.|`|Y5qZCpl0aa	I know this is all stressing you out now. But she will come around when she sees how hard it is. I wouldn't press the issue. Just let things play out.You seem to be a wonderful mother and I would support her through all of it. Your still mom. And for your husband to say all those things I'm sure he's just frustrated but he has no right to tell you that your a bad mother. I hope the best for you two.|`|FzFSzilmaa	the damage is already done... she's got a baby, and that little mite is the most important thing at the moment...<br>  <br>  he should stop whining and stay out of the way... it is upto you and your daughter about what needs doing now... if the babies father wants to be involved, then he should be made welcome and allowed to spend time with his son... no doubt his parents are livid about the situation...|`|5eSSAT69aa	As a parent myself, I would have definately explained the alternatives to delivering a baby. I feel that raising the baby for your teen daughter is telling her that she didn't get into any trouble, when in reality she screwed herself royally and needs to know it. I dont care how many thumbs down I get, it's the truth. Your daughter made a mistake but by you raising the baby till she can take over is still bogging her down with  a child her whole life. She can go to school and get a good career, while u sit around and deal withher mistakes. Thats pathetic!! She needs a good punishment. She needs ajob too.|`|AosW4IvHaa	Well i don't get how you never knew she was having sex, and did not make her use birth control?  I think you are making it easy for her to get pregnant again... You better get ready for a new motherhood.  <br>  You may not like it after a while... When you want to go some place and you have to lug a baby around while your daughter is busy running around being a 16 year old, and the father of the baby is not wanting to be around at all.. <br>  Are you nut's?  Yes you are a negligent mother.  Your daughter should not be pregnant  right now.  <br>  You should have taught her to protect herself.<br>  It all seems exciting at this time... But after a while you'll hate it. Not the baby or your daughter!  It will all be good after the boy grows up and you then deal with a teen. WOW! Get ready to lose your husband... Because he does not seem too thrilled about being a father again at whatever age he is.<br>  You're just going to be used until you get too old and then the grand-kids' and your kid's will throw you into a nursing home.  You better live now while you can...  Oh, and yes you are going to be the mother... Your daughter is not going to want to baby sit when all the other kid's her age are out partying. Sounds to me like your daughter just said "oh it's OK if i have a baby."  "My mom will watch it."  Your daughter should be made to get a job and still go to school, and still be a mom.. Cause if you do the crime you should do the time..  I came from the school of hard knocks ... I knew not to get regnant.. My mom bought me birth control and taught me how to use it.  Thanks mom!  My mom also taught me about safe sex. Sex is a reality.. How to protect yourself is too.  I must say you either did not pay attention, or you are a bad mom.  If you let her run wild, and did not wonder if she might be having un protected sex then i see why your husband is upset.  A child is a big deal.  A big responsibility. too.  It all seem exciting right now.  But when reality sets in you will be tied down.  How you are l  prepaid for this new baby.. Good luck.|`|JWLyNrLHaa	I think it is actually funny he suggested grounding here... I doubt that will do any good now.<br>  <br>  As for taking care of her baby, in my opinion I think you should force your daughter take care of him as much as possible. Let her fully understand her situation. I know how important education is and I think it is wonderful you are willing to watch the baby, but if she only plays with him when she feels like it, she might go out and make another mistake because grandma doesn't mind taking full responsibility. <br>  <br>  Just don't let her fully off the hook.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	Humm Who is the child in this family?  I guess it is step-dad.  Your daughter made a mistake.  She isn't the first and won't be the last.  You are helping your daughter through this tough time and ensuring that she has the opportunities to have a good future with her child by getting her education.  She is still responsible for the child, you are just there to help teach her to care for her baby and provide the care so she can go to school.<br>  <br>  As for the baby's father, he had a hand in this child.  It wasn't only your daughter.  He has the right to see the child, spend time with the child, be a father to the child and help support the child. <br>  <br>  All in all, it should be about what is best for the child, not what is convenient for your husband.|`|sbeoF50gaa	You can't change what has already happen. I think you are doing the best you can with the situation. Your husband wants that baby to grow up fatherless? That is ridiculous. Your daughter and grandson are lucky that he even wants to stick around, most guys would jet. Your daughter made a mistake, and you as her mother want to be sure it doesn't ruin her life. I think you are doing what's right. Just be sure she pitches in and you don't become "mom" to the baby. This is still HER responsibility and you are just there to help her get through it.|`|yNz4p3B4aa	no....if u taught her then thats all u could have done it was her that went and got pregnat....all u can do now if continue being her mother.....|`|5snO0Yngaa	What a lovely person you are. To embrase your grandchild with your arms open wide. Sometimes people are in a hurry to come into this world! Sounds like your grandchild can't wait.<br>  Do not allow this to be a negative thing. The child deserves to be treated as special.<br>  This child will grow up to be healthy and confident and happy - all because you have accepted this situation and have a heart of gold.<br>  Don't worry about your husband. Once he sees the lovely baby and holds the grandchild, he will fall in love! Men are like that!<br>  You are the world's best mum!<br>  And now are you are going to be the world best nanna!<br>  It is up to you to keep this family together and healthy and happy. The more members the happier! The bigger the family the better! It is up to you to speak to each member of the family to ensure that they have the 'right attitude' and accept no less.<br>  I hope you are very blessed because of your selflessness.<br>  You are wonderful.|`|K8UjtbiSaa	dont be silly you are NOT a bad mother !!<br>  your daughter is pretty young but shes not the first? and it was her choice to do what she did ... and even though she may have made a mistake - think about the beautiful result of this mistake  :) :) x no wonder you cant wait !!!! -your going to be a grandmother! lol x and i think the babys father should definetely be around if he wants to see his baby !!!!  <br>  ps. very smart giving you guardenship until shes ready to take care of him :) ... glad shes concentraiting on her carreeer to - so many young girls would just throw their lifes away and live off benifits! x|`|ibFTUi1taa	You are not a bad mother, if anything you are a wonderful mother for being so understanding! <br>  I really don't like how your husband doesn't want the baby's father around. The fact that this boy wants to be around his child when most would run is very noble. He should be allowed to be around his son. <br>  I think that your husband needs to be talked to. Everyone makes mistakes, and they were not yours. Your daughter got pregnant and seems like a responsible young girl. If he can't understand that then you may want to rethink the relationship a tiny bit. <br>  I wish you all the best, for you, and your family. =)

Listen without offering advice or interrupting. <br>  Step2Be patient with the grieving person's changeable moods. It's normal for someone who is grieving to alternate between anger, sadness, numbness and acceptance. <br>  Step3Give the person as much time as he needs to grieve. Telling him to 'get over it' or 'let it go' won't help him grieve any faster. <br>  Step4Ask the bereaved what you can do to help. Try not to get frustrated if he doesn't know what he needs. <br>  Step5Offer suggestions of what you could do to help. For example, does the grieving person need more space? Does he want you to be around more? Are there tasks or errands he needs done? <br>  Step6Show affection such as hugs or handholding if the bereaved seems receptive. If he seems uninterested in affection, try not to get irritated - this will pass with time. <br>  Step7Encourage the grieving person to join a grief support group. He can call his doctor for a referral or look in the community service section of the yellow pages for grief support services. <br>  Step8Urge the grieving person to get professional help if he's so depressed that he's unable to function day to day. Assist him in setting up an appointment with a doctor to discuss counseling or possible medication. <br>  Things You’ll Need:<br>  Electronic Greeting Cards <br>  Paper Greeting Cards <br>  Flower Bouquets <br>  Food <br>  Movie Tickets <br>  Museum Tickets <br>  Symphony Tickets <br>  Exercise Equipments|`|evEJxv06aa	talk to her do something that will make her feel better.|`|klYCoFJVaa	She's in pain.

zNIIvAjCaa	minska89, Don't think for one reason it has anything to do with you, drink and sex do not really go together, drinking can stop the body from achieveing it's goal.  The fact that he goes on and on has two issues, one is that you get more out of it (unless you get bored) the other is he has has so much to drink he is unable to add the finishing touch.  It is unwise to make love after a few drinks as most people elude it was the wrong thing to do the morning after.  Try making love with out the use of drink and see what happens, if the same appears to happen he should go and see a doctor as he might have a problem. Also I hope you are using protection.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.  Peter|`|XvaKmukeaa	No problem, not your fault at all. Im a guy and after a night out as you know our bodies are affected depending on how much alcohol is consumed. Men generally can't "get there" when we drink because alot of feeling is gone in that region even though "blood is flowing".

sbeoF50gaa	I was like that, a flirt and more. My husband... hid his anger and eventually it all blew up. I felt so bad for my actions and I had to change. So I did. I no longer act that way and no longer even think of other men. It took my husband a long time to trust me again. I think he finally does. I think it just takes time, and if that never goes away on it's own... then I don't know. I finally had to realize I wasn't going to get any better than what was right in front of me. I saw that I was hurting him and ruining what we had. Looking back on the things I did and the things I put him through I feel sick. I don't know what made your partner straighten up and but you really believe he cares for you, enough to change, then you should trust that he did it for you and he will behave. Jealousy is a natural feeling, we all feel it. Talk to him about your feelings, your fears and maybe he can console you. Communication in key in all relationships.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	I don't think its about you controlling your jealousy, its about your bf being what he neds to be for you.  <br>  You can only give so much before he decides that he needs to contribute his part as well.  It takes 50/50 to make the relationship work...you've given your 50 percent, now its his turn.   Good luck!|`|0c44c557b5bc5a2df5e3cbbcf028239baa	Someone needs to tell him to run from you. He'll be miserable the rest of his life worried about even looking at another woman. He'll always be worried about how you will react if he's just friendly or notices other women. He'll spend the rest of his life looking down, straight ahead or at his plate, so he wont arouse your jealousy. He'll be afraid no matter which way he looks you'll accuse him of looking at other women. Explain how you feel and give him a chance to run. You knew he was a friendly guy when you starting dating him, so why do you feel the need to change him. Go out and find a guy who's already molded the way you want him and don't try to belittle this guy.|`|ulW7G8nPaa	At one point in time in a relationship we all experience jealousy whether it's founded or not.  My husband is the same way, he's friendly; a people person and a lot of girls I will admit do want him, but I'm the one... I'm the one with the ring, I'm the one who has his heart, I'm the one he's with not them.  That's what you need to remember you're the one he loves; you're the one he's with.  He changed some of his ways to appease your insecurities,  Don't push him away letting your jealousy control and ruin your relationship. You need to trust the love that you have.  Hope this helps.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Jealousy is a natural thing but it can ruin alot of relationships.

Dad worked afternoon shift for 17 years, so we as school kids didn't see him much. He was sleeping when we went to school, left for work before we came home, and we were in bed by the time he got home. Weekends we had to be quiet in the mornings as he was catching up on his sleep, then he'd work as a free lance electrician in the afternoons. <br>  Didn't appreciate it at the time, but with 8 kids he was working hard to make sure we all had whatever we needed.

Some girls would go insane, they'd run around the room knowing that someone called them pretty, beautiful, hot etc. But you have to be careful, if a girl kept on saying "I'm ugly, no one likes me.

He'll know if you're forcing yourself to laugh at his jokes.<br>  <br>  Guys also appreciate a woman who is straightforward -- it's no fun for anybody when you get locked into the "Read My Mind, Or Else" game.

So i consider simplicity and cuteness as the most important things to be found in a girl.

If you are what he wants then he will come to you when he has graduated and he can lift his head from that task. Never wait for a man or pin all your hopes to his actions. Just live your life, build your life... keep some space around your heart so that it will be able to survive if this does not work out. With him being gone for the Summer anything could happen... just be sure that he treats you with respect and treats you as an equal... don't wait for your cell to ring and don't allow him to believe that you will always be there for him on his time and at his pace.<br>  <br>  If it is meant to be than you will be together, just promise me you won't be one of those women that allow men to come up with yet another reason not to walk you down the aisle.<br>  <br>  - Let me graduate first<br>  - Let me get a great job first<br>  - Let me get comfortable at my job first<br>  - Let me save up some money first<br>   <br>  That line of thinking is how too many women end up being with a guy for 5-8 years with no wedding... no commitment... and then they bail on you anyway... make sure that kids don't come until the ring does... and even then you might want to wait a couple of years into your marriage to make sure you got it right before you have a child.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Guy's don't go with their girlfriends to look at wedding rings (and ask ring size) unless he is considering popping the question.

There is lots of free counseling available and plenty of quality churches whose leaders can direct you to great advisers. <br>  <br>  Killing yourself is not an act of strength. Its pretty stupid actually. Show yourself you've got brains. Get involved with life and go to school. Education is the key to long health.<br>  <br>  Good luck in all you do.

tRcO5uyiaa	I don't know how in the world you got yourself into this mess, but you really need to get yourself out. Immediately. It is understandable that you naturally want to help this woman, but you have to know that she has serious emotional problems that she will have to deal with BEFORE she gets into a relationship with anybody else. She will require serious counselling and need time to heal. She is very confused about what she wants, who she likes/loves, who is safe to be with and who is not. Her sense of devotion is misdirected and she is extremely vulnerable to any and all suggestion. I understand her very well. I've been in her shoes.<br>  <br>  Stay in contact with her (by phone only is preferable) and let her know you are her friend only (ie: do not kiss her, touch her, etc). You can always pursue a relationship with her once she has received some professional help and she has her bearings back. The best friend you can be right now is just an ear to lend.|`|djUMvICoaa	If you can't be just a friend, let her go.  She is going to need a friend to help her with the guys she is picking. but there is a reason she picks them and goes back to them, something feels right about it, or normal, and you can't change that for her.  Someone who has had chaos in their life growing up looks for chaos when they get older.  That's not what you need.  I'd move on.

In other words, you made her complicit in adultery without letting her know she was.   <br>  <br>  Why would someone do that, exactly?<br>  <br>  Probably because he never really wanted to commit---and saw the ex as a convenient escape hatch from his marriage. Most men would understand that their wives would not tolerate long term cheating---particularly so soon after the wedding.<br>  <br>  So I would say the man had a deep need to destroy himself, and no regard for the woman he used to that end.|`|AA11460234	Throw yourself at her mercy.<br>  <br>  Howvere I doubt that would help.

We won't muck with your head and try to suggest there's an ultimate definitive definition out there. Some people will try to do just that and come up with some tidy little definition, like, "Romance is showing you care." Sure, it sounds good at first, but although draping your coat over a puddle and asking if she remembered to brush her teeth that morning may be actions triggered by this same motivation, they rate distinctly differently on the romance scale.<br>  <br>  Although it's not so much a definition, as it is no more precise than the word "romance" itself, one way to describe romance succinctly is "what women want out of a relationship." In other words, men aren't romantic, and if you're a man, that's why you need this guide. If you're a woman, of course, you were born with an innate knowledge of this stuff and need not read further.<br>  <br>  But though romance may not be definable, there are still some hard fast rules. Below, we have documented many of the atomic elements of romance. Mix these ingredients up, and you've got it.<br>  <br>  Intrinsic Romance<br>  Some things are inherently romantic, like hearts. This is very useful, because you can pile things upon the object of your affections and win romance points without expending any additional effort or thought. The trick is to figure out what is romantic and what is not. There is a basic rule of thumb to follow: if it's cool, it's not romantic. For example, high powered rifles are not romantic. Science fiction is not romantic. DVD players are not romantic unless they're playing Sleepless In Seattle.<br>  <br>  But a whole ton of things are intrinsically romantic, and you should use them to your advantage.<br>  <br>  Cute Things<br>  Teddy bears are romantic. Puppies are romantic. Cherubic baby archers are romantic. Those photographs where two little kids exhibit an unnatural affection for each other and only the roses are in color are romantic.<br>  <br>  Taking advantage of the intrinsic romance in cute things obviously depends upon recognizing which things are cute. The rule is simple. Small things are cute. If you see a food product in a grocery store that comes in a smaller package than usual, get it, because there's a very good chance it's cute. The same goes for travel size shampoo, toothpaste, and so on. Find a store that sells doll house stuff, and your supply of cute things can be limitless.<br>  <br>  Low Light<br>  Candles are romantic. Sunrises and sunsets are romantic. Any kind of low light, you see, is romantic, hence why dinner dates after dark are more romantic than lunch dates at noon. Combine low light sources, and it stands to reason that the air of romance will be so thick, your beloved will be blind to anything else but the radiance of her shimmering knight in armor. Open the curtains on a sunset and light some candles, and you might even be able to get away with watching a football game during dinner.<br>  <br>  Red<br>  Red is romantic, because red is the color of love and passion. Consider roses. Red roses mean, "I love you." Yellow roses mean, "Let's just be friends," which is synonymous with, "You are irritating, and I hate you." So you do not want to be wrong. Get her red roses, red ribbons, red balloons, red teddy bears, red puppies, and red tickets to the World Series, and she'll fall hopelessly under your spell.<br>  <br>  Background Music<br>  Background music is romantic, and note the word "background," because not just any music is romantic. For music to be romantic, it must be too soft to hear. Also, it may not be lively or funny or good. Elevator music is the most romantic genre of music out there.<br>  <br>  Chocolates<br>  Chocolates are not only romantic, they're complimentary. When you give a box of chocolates to your beloved, it says, "You could pig out on this tub of lard and bloat out to three tons, but you'd still be the apple of my eye." It doesn't matter if it's true -- it's the message that counts. But the real reason to give your loved one chocolates is because any loved one worth her salt will turn right around and offer you some. It's a win-win no matter how you look at it. Buy her a red one shaped like a heart, and you're in like Flynn.<br>  <br>  Fancy Curly Things<br>  Flair and flourishes are romantic. Whenever you get her a greeting card, get one of the ones with all the curly pink scribbles on it. When you write her letters, make the tails of the 'g's and 'y's really long and the loops in the 'd's and 'b's and 'p's really big. That's way romantic. Notice how romantic the title banner at the top of this page is? The 'R' is particularly romantic, because it's red.<br>  <br>  The Most Intrinsically Romantic Thing Ever<br>  Based on the data above, the single most romantic thing in the universe can be calculated scientifically. It is, simply, a small red candle made out of chocolate and shaped like a teddy bear holding a heart with scribbles all over it that plays a tune when you wind it up. Toss her one of these at sunset o|`|1tLmTjBxaa	tunne unnadu

z1C75GIaaa	O.k so the other day I was making dinner. I decided that some cheese and broccoli would be a good side dish. I was already in a rush since my boyfriend and kids were already sitting at  the table.  I opened the bag that contained the frozen broccoli... I put it in a bowl and I saw some yellow/orange chunks that kind of looked like carrots.. So I said out loud to myself "oh, I didn't know it came with carrots, so where's the cheese?" I didn't give it a 2nd thought and I put the bowl in the microwave and about 5 min. later I took the bowl out and now the broccoli had cheese. ??? So out loud I said. "Hey, what happened to the carrots?!"  LOL, it was just seconds after saying that, that I realized that there was never carrots in the bowl : )<br>  <br>  Ha, ha.. I was laughing so hard that I actually sat on the floor as my boyfriend was asking what had happened... I told him....|`|pdN0UHrsaa	Hello^_^!<br>  <br>  I have the most embarrassing thing that ever happen to me. It's when I was 14. We had our presentation on the stage of our auditorium, and I was accidentally blocked on a microphone wire, and i slipped. I fell of the ground and thousands of people laughed at me. Isn't it embarrassing?|`|484c8e17aef71579d986937035d2ba24aa	Ok here's mine I was found in my step-sisters bed with her in it on top of me by my step-mom. when i saw her i rolled my step-sister off of me and my step-mom fated when she seen my cock|`|5vgnrvcmaa	an extremely long, long unexpected and unstoppable fart came out of me in the dead silence of a gym.

4qcXECiPaa	ok im not an expert on this kinda thing, but im what some would call talented at reading people and it sounds to me like he is just trying to adjust to the new living arrangement, it is a major step in the relationship right up their with first intercourse if you dont do it on the first date of coarse and engagement, marriage and finally kids these are some really major times!|`|S4HUVnzkaa	He just wants company that's why he is glad you are there.<br>  he sounds like a real sniveler.<br>  Get a real man and forget this guy, he is to lame for you.<br>  Tell him to move his boy friend in with him, and quit messing around.<br>  You will never be happy with a mamas boy.|`|eNlGfAPaaa	that the signs... stop calling u... stop answering your phone...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  dont waste your time... get out.|`|SndrZbn8aa	If he has put up with you breaking up with up that many times over just a year he obviously cares a great deal for you. Of course he's a bit insecure! You've broken up with him so many times that he's prolly tip toeing around you hoping you won't break up with him again. Most people would not stay with some one for so long who is constantly ending the relationship. I wouldn't. Would you? <br>  How is he acting strangely? Perhaps you're reading too much into his behavior. Him even talking about kids and marriage with you is a big indicator that he loves you. Most guys don't just throw those words out there without being serious about it. Most, not all.<br>  It sounds like you already got your answer from him. He told you he loves you that he is attracted to you and he likes living with you. What else could he possibly do to prove to you that he wants to be with you?<br>  I hope I don't come off rude, but if I were him I would be the one who is confused.
56LJzg3baa	you dont have to like her friend back. if you start flirting with this girl then surely her friend will realise that it isn't her you are into. <br>  <br>  or you could always get close to the friend, which would mean you could get close to the girl you like. i know that is harsh but it works :D|`|WRC0O6tqaa	for getting some things have to loosing some .. if u really like that girl then  should change ur mind and accept her friend...othervisse u dont have way to get her///|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	Well make it know that you dont like her friend and you like her.|`|CQPvngCeaa	Oh. I used to have a guy whom I liked and liked me back, but his friend liked me too, and I guess you can call him a ... pervert and stalker? Yeah well, no offence. Anyway I found his friend extremely irritating, and he went around telling people he liked me, which made things worse because people thought... yeah.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I tried to get rid of that friend by getting closer to the one I liked. I pretended I didn't get what he / the others meant when they teased me or talked to me about him. I didn't reply his SMSes, I didn't pick up the phone, or else I was extremely formal. In short I avoided him and got closer to the one I liked.<br>  <br>  I wasn't all out to hurt him, but only to hint, you know hint hint? It was rather effective though it took some time for it to get through. I don't know if this applies for everyone, but I wish you luck. Whatever you do, do NOT, I repeat, do NOT get close to the girl, because you might mislead her, and when you reject her, rumours spread, tongues wag, ok? Anyway, jia you! (which in Chinese means go for it.)|`|kYcBVmRMaa	tell the girl that you like her and if she says she likes you go out with her and then he m8t has got no choise to like it coz your going out with her|`|B9jLDyC7aa	tel her str8 up that u like HER and not her friend. ask her out

4vLt3SqFaa	I understand completely and think most pregnant women are the most appealing creatures on earth and I don't think it has nothing to do with body shape as much as sexuality.<br>  <br>  Being obviously pregnant is one of the most blatantly sexual statements a woman can make.  It is like shouting  "Hey I am sexual - I have unprotected sex and I enjoy it!"  <br>  <br>  Everything about the pregnancy speaks of this and my own experience it that I loved pregnant sex especially when she was carrying a male child and the extra testosterone was driving her desire through the ceiling.  I mean once she was no longer sick, she had to have it all the time - would wake me up in the middle fo the night to have it even when we had done it before bed.<br>  <br>  And if your partner is not large breasted she absolutely loves being that way for the first time when pregnant.  If the woman feels loved and secure it can be a wonderful time for both of you.  Even as medical professional who has seen far more pregnant women that most people ever do I still find the process and the changes in her body nothing short of a miracle! To me pregnant women are a celebration of life and everything it involves including their own sexuality.|`|TtMKPBR3aa	well.......... i dunno|`|vMKEg29kaa	Every woman is attractive her own way point is: how to make her beauty rise right. Not necessarily her status or shape but how they reveal right.|`|H9RTbhKYaa	It seems that every time I see a pregnant chick, I just imagine the baby and their innards spilling out of them at Wal-Mart. Maybe I should stop watching so many movies...|`|jNmXo24Waa	no dude. its basic instinct. me too!|`|EKM9AKc2aa	what?|`|4LbTpgijaa	That doesn't make you weird.. you just have a pregnant women fetish. It's not that uncommon; there's actually a lot of porno's with like 8 month pregnant women. It's really not that bad, and plus, I don't know your marital status but if you do or when you do have a wife and she is pregnant you will find her even more attractive instead of some men who are too disgusted to even have sex with their own pregnant wife.|`|Asrxi2ZQaa	No i dont think your weird. Im 6 months pregnant and my husband thinks im as hot as ever. And cant keep his hands off me. If your weird he must be too. I would hope the woman 8 1/2 months pregnant would be your wife and not sleep with a pregnant woman just because she cant get pregnant.|`|y4zYkceEaa	I don't think you're a weirdo! Maybe a little out of the ordinary but hey everyone has their preferences. I think a pregnant woman is a beautiful thing! It's a lovely gift from god & mother nature. ;))|`|6ZFoujUGaa	sounds bit wierd to me... unless the pregnant woman is your wife...<br>  becareful with the babby...|`|e97vt0Slaa	Everyone has their own preferences.

I think you should think about the baby's safety|`|HQEn6jbnaa	no, that's a weird fetish|`|EHujGe5Oaa	She'd better be pregnant with you child, other wise your on edge of being a weirdo.

Might be weird for some people but who is anyone to judge.|`|ai76o21qaa	depends
IuuwLnFIaa	Just ignore her. shes putting your down and its not very motherly off her, she should be helping you and trying to push you on to having a girlfriend, not insulting you.|`|AA10698189	Well as much as I think your mum shouldnt have said what she did to you you are equally as bad by saying that girls in Yorkshire are not as nice/attractive as those in London. that is such a load of rubbish. Wherever you go there are pretty and not so pretty people - and so what?  And guess what I am from London.  so many pretty girls not from London!  You sound like you need to grow up.  I actually think you  have made this whole scenario up anyway.|`|1eDNxCZKaa	she is most probably just upset and scared because maybe she will feel lonely if you leave. BUT if it is what you want to do    go for it ..  n boys r better   no offence.   but stand up 4 urself     n hav a good life|`|vOivX0ZUaa	Lol wow.... ya that was kinda unreasonable thing to say.  I know a couple people from london and they come off snobby but really they aren't.  Don't get fooled|`|ZmikGFTEaa	Mm.. sounds pretty harsh but i think she does not want you to move away,..<br>  she is probably concerned about you and she is worried you might end up doing something you aren't supposed to or you should do..<br>  No mother would ever tell her child that he/she is ugly or anything no matter what..<br>  she does tell you abt London being a snobby and unfriendly place soo that shows she dint really mean it!<br>  Cheer up.. and i feel you should stay close to her and if you really hate it that much then try convincing ehr that you really want to move not just because of the Gals but also your job which you hate..<br>  She would then probably understand..<br>  Good luck!|`|f46d7715219180bc009af5394dfa63e8aa	that'ss our mom ,sometimes we forget our kids grow up and that they even have feelings ,I am sure if you tell your mom how the statement made you feel she wouldreassuree youthata she did not mean it the way it came out ,I think its a badideae to to move because of how the girls look,be happy you got a mom who was there to listen ,life is to short to find fault in our love ones , a visit and a  permament move are to different things ,stay put ,if you are thinking of moving visit for a longer time and really think things over ,are you even old enough to know what you want. Best of Luck to ya ,and I mean that|`|jlUczlQZaa	I think your mother was being selfish and trying to make you stay in Yorkshire, unfortunately, attacking your self-esteem in the process was mean-spirited and hurtful.   <br>  <br>  I don't know your relationship with your mother, however, you did discuss your intentions with her, so maybe if you tell her that you are intending to move to London regardless of her opinions and would appreciate her support in making it happen, not her insults or negativity, it can open the door for further discussions about what she said.  Unfortunately, when children grow up and leave the nest some parents find the separation very difficult and will even sabotage their children's efforts in order to feed their inner fear of separation anxiety.  Help your mom understand that your leaving for London will just make the time you do see each other that much more special.  <br>  <br>  I hope she realizes what she is doing is unhealthy and selfish and that by supporting and praising you will in the end bring you closer together regardless of the miles in between.|`|Shp5riE6aa	She doesn't want you to leave.|`|3DI0ZJS5aa	Your mum sounds very mean!!<br>  Arn't you supposed to make your kids feel good about themselves?!<br>  <br>  I would have a word & tell her that she upset you with her comments........ by the way, i'm from Leeds & we aint that bad love!!|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	That was a very horrible thing for any mother to say to their child. If you are an adult, do what is best for you. And keep in mind, there is someone for everyone. Personality, integrity  and character are the basic fundamentals for finding a mate. Good luck.|`|qDLT1eh6aa	Sounds a nasty thing to say, designed to attack your confidence, therefore making you not have the courage to make the move.<br>  If I were you now, I'd make that move to London and prove her wrong!|`|hHndD5SEaa	Jesus!! that was an awful thing to say to you!!!!! <br>  Mothers are supposed to be supportive of their children - that was very harsh of her!<br>  Best thing you could do is get yourself off to London and prove her wrong!<br>  xx|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	go do it hun prove her wrong then laugh in her face.|`|AA10930947	I think that is your mother's way of keeping you there with her even though it wasn't very nice i could never say a thing like that to my kids.|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	Your mother called you an ugly loser.  I can see how this would be offensive to you.  Sounds like she might want you to stay and will say anything to make that happen.|`|0lwGsRNqaa	That was a terrible thing for her to say. Moms are supposed to be supportive of their children.|`|OWdcFeDmaa	That was very unreasonable of her. Whether or not she actually thinks that she has no right to say it.|`|svYiQZUHaa	your mother sounds mean and how old are you? I mean if you are over 18 you don't need your mothers consent to do anything.|`|Jcu24pe3aa	As a mother, I would never have said that. I think your mom is just feeling insecure about you wanting to leave. She expressed it badly. She should be happy you want to leave and improve your situation. Maybe talk with her again and explain to her that there is a bigger world out there than Yorkshire. You need to explore and grow, but that you love and need her still, your just growing up and you need her to understand where you are coming from.|`|Y5WJWnvbaa	what she said is wrong on many levels, both as a mother, and speaking about the idea of you going to another place in such a derisive manner [not to mention speaking about the place itself dirisively!]<br>  <br>  she is probably, in her own way, just trying to protect you. you are her son, and the thought of you moving away to tbe big smoke to get a different job and a nice girlfriend probably just brought out a slightly ugly side in her caring!<br>  <br>  not everywhere in london is snobby, and not everyone is unfriendly. with a few million people living between the walls, it is as likely you will find someone to hit off with there as anywhere!|`|gj6rpPjYaa	Your mother simply doesn't want you to go and work in London. The reasons she gave you are her good reasons; if you probe her, you'll find her real reasons. She knows, like every other woman does, that your looks are not all it takes to have a glamorous GF; and London being a snobby and unfriendly city is her own opinion. I am an African, and I have been to London once. My opinion of that city, if it is anything to go by, is that London is great; the people are extremely well cultured and friendly.

You did not tell your age, and a lot more. Maybe he's only shy. Or perhaps you're right, he only likes the way you look. It's heard to tell.

Mauybe he is shy, I don't know.|`|2U4U22cxaa	Yeah it seems like he  talks to you when he wants a date or to possibly make out or  do the deed.

wH0brA6Eaa	In order to lose your virginity it would have to include vaginal penetration with the penis, fingering does not count. Breaking the hymen also has nothing to do with losing ones virginity.|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	No, you need a penis in your vagina to lose your virginity.|`|tBaCFTtBaa	everyone has a difference of opinion what "loss of virginity" is.. but medically, it is intercourse with someone.. my hymen was broken by a gyno because i had an ovarian cyst when i was 15... that did not count as losing my virginity.  good luck!|`|pXosKQz4aa	youll still be tight ;-)|`|VC51Wnxwaa	Yes you are a whore|`|Kd3GRiLyaa	are you stupid?
q7KL0wuuaa	Keep doing what works for you? I know that I do the same thing to my husband at times, I won't talk to him until he's ready to seriously talk about what has happened? He shouldn't make you feel guilty. Don't let him turn it around on you, stay focused on what the problem is, and if he does turn it around and won't talk to you then that's his problem~|`|bGyVJ6meaa	You shouldnt give him the "silent treatment", it is a childish and unhealthy way of communicating.<br>  <br>  I am not criticising you, we all so easily fall into negative ways of communicating with our partners.<br>  <br>  I think it would be better to talk more openly with him about the best ways you can both communicate when there are problems, what you dont like about style, what he doen't like about yours. Make promises to eachother how you will try to communicate in the future.<br>  <br>  This may help a happier and healthier relationship|`|4JrDGW7Taa	The silent treatment never works. What is at stake is trying to find some compromise to your different views. Isn't it obvious that in order to get along in a marriage, you have to explore how your partner feels about things. Without that information you can not make any adjustments. And, for two people who come from different worlds, to get along in a relationship, you will have to explain yourself to your partner.<br>  <br>  For more info check out my source.|`|hYZIYla0aa	Honey this is a control issue.You better get counseling ,quickly! It only gets worse when they play these games,It may turn violent at one point.Been there done that.It is going to be hard to convince him to go to counseling.You have to try though.|`|Xj5G5VU6aa	I'd say marriage counseling, he should not react that way toward you, and it sounds as if its getting worse, so I'd definitely make sure something is done to fix the issue.|`|494686d7f957aafee66b8f4b81212affaa	Communication is the Key to a successful marriage.|`|EdDLydH7aa	Hmmmm...i never realized how controlling ppl can be until i started reading some of these questions and the advice given so i will put in my own 2 cents :)...hurting you physically or verbally just is not something you have to put up with, like i've said times before, i stayed b/c i thought it would get better and almost died, i still have nightmares, and yes it hurts to be single again, but what hurts more, is the mental anguish, not talking to him only infuriates him to the point of wanting to hurt you any way he can and sometimes it becomes physical...this may sound rash, but get out...ASAP...no one, male or female deserves to be abused in any way, shape or form...i know its scary to think about leaving, but it's scarier thinking about what could happen if he goes postal and hurts you worse than he already has...please consider leaving, before you get hurt or end up dead...good luck to you and best wishes...you'll be in my prayers :)...even if you leave on a trial basis until he can get control of his anger and you guys can learn how to communicate would be better than sitting there waiting to see what's going ot happen next...you may not want 3rd party counseling, but you may need it b/c the lines of communication aren't working right now, they are becoming dangerous...if the things you were doing before worked, you wouldn't be here asking for advice...again, good luck and best wishes|`|S2aeGQpdaa	try sharing this with him when things are calm:<br>  <br>  <br>  WISDOM FROM BIBLE PROVERBS<br>  <br>  ? Proverbs 10:19: “In the abundance of words there does not fail to be transgression, but the one keeping his lips in check is acting discreetly.”<br>  <br>  When you are upset, you may say more than you mean to—and later regret it.<br>  <br>  ? Proverbs 15:18: “An enraged man stirs up contention, but one that is slow to anger quiets down quarreling.”<br>  <br>  Stinging accusations will likely make your spouse defensive, whereas patient listening will help both of you work toward a resolution.<br>  <br>  ? Proverbs 17:27: “Anyone holding back his sayings is possessed of knowledge, and a man of discernment is cool of spirit.”<br>  <br>  When you sense that anger is building, it is best to keep quiet so as to avoid a full-blown confrontation.<br>  <br>  ? Proverbs 29:11: “All his spirit is what a stupid one lets out, but he that is wise keeps it calm to the last.”<br>  <br>  Self-control is vital. A temperamental outburst of harsh words will only alienate your spouse.|`|1hciyvKdaa	You need some help with learning to argue but in a way that is not relationship threatening. Go get a book at the book store to help you learn. My ex was very mouthy, and fast to blurt out things, and I never had a good comeback, he enjoyed my confusion hed  get me into so he got his point through and left me scrambling to defend myself. I hated it. I never did learn to deal with it. Its been many years and I fault myself for not learning to deal with his bullying. If you feel secure enough when this happens, just get your purse, and put on your coat and say, I am tired of this, I am tired of how you bad mouth me during stupid fights that are basically over nothing. This is not what I got married for, and until you learn to slow down and not hammer on me, Im out of here. See if he tries to stop you from leaving, see what his reaction is, you can leave for an hour to avoid the fight, or go to moms or a safe mutual friends house and stay there for the night. Sometimes just asking, in the middle of the heat, is this worth this fight to us? Do we both really want to ruin our ngiht like this? Pose questions instead of the silent treatment. Keep just fighting to end the fight. But reading up and good argumentive techniques, might also help. It sucks I know, some men just take life out on their wife, they enjoy it, mine did, hes my ex now. I won, I dont have to listen to it anymore, and wont ever do that again. I wish you the best, lifes too short for drama like this.|`|BfDM12ptaa	oh...i know(*raising hand*)my husband does this...not everytime..but he does....i get hell lot of confusion.....what i do is when he comes to console i take it positive and make friends...but in a good mood i ask him y he said such words to me....then he says sorry most of the times<br>  moral:silent treeatment is good...dont use too much of it|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Your problem is you are arguing and not simply disagreeing.  If your husband hurts you (intentionally or unintentionally) or he does something you disagree with (ex. spending money on an X-Box 360 when the kids need food / clothing) you need to convey that with-out it turning into an argument.<br>  <br>  If he becomes belligerent / angry / mean when you are simply disagreeing / something is bothering you, than you may need to tell him you don't appreciate his attitude / actions.  If he doesn't mature, well you may need to decide if this is the guy you want to stay married to.|`|QJslTCUBaa	It's called "Deflecting". This means he is throwing all of the blame back on to you. It's your fault, not his. He needs to grow up. You are not sounding mean, you're telling the truth. Good Luck :-)|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Well, than stop giving him the silent treatment and start talking!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Marriage Counseling.  They will "teach" you to fight fair...
2vgbJhlRaa	does he show signs of interest in you? because you cant force someone to like you. if hes not interested then you should move on and  not invest time and love into a potential heartbreak! if you really want to pursue him then the best thing to do is to be confident in yourself, dont think of what other people will say about you, be natural with him and make sure that he knows you like him, start to physically flirt with him, get some alone time i.e. studybuddies? you can even ask him out on dates(its not always up to a guy to do it, take initiative)|`|uqSbj8WQaa	If your worried he didn't believe you maybe you could talk to him again and make sure he knows you were serious.  As far as getting involved with somebody who has feelings for  somebody else, that is always a bad idea and will never work out in your favor.  You also can't force somebody to like you more.  They will are they won't and if you have to change the way you act and who you are to win over their affection you won't be happy in the long run.|`|VBk4bA8Vaa	flirt. get his number. kiss him. and in that order. <br>  <br>  but when your flirting dont be too eager. flirt when you have the chance. and be cute. you should know how.. well at least i hope. tease him a bit. and if some one comes to talk to him just leave. touch his arm. stuff like that. <br>  <br>  then when you start actually getting to know him ask for his number. or better yet give him your number. which ever way just make an excuse to get his number. and if he doesnt text you then you probably have your answer to whether he likes you or not. <br>  <br>  and finally. if theirs an upcoming dance then do it then. anyways. make an excuse for the two of you to be alone. and then be like "umm (whatever his name is) bob. i like you." hell probably be like "ok" and then be like "i just wanted to tell you" and then kiss him. dont make out with him tho. because then youll be too easy. and then the ball will be in his court. <br>  <br>  remember before you kiss him actually see if he is giving any signs back. like responding to your signals. like if you text him and it takes an hour for him to reply back it probably means he doesnt like you back.|`|rbjcVGFNaa	Just spend more time with him, find common ground, share interests, be there if and only if he needs you, too much effection is never good unless they need it at the time :P|`|Qzztu8biaa	kiss him.<br>  only way to find out.<br>  <br>  or, judging by how incredibly infantile this is, grow up and then kiss him.|`|Xi2lGjKyaa	take note what he like most<br>  do it for him<br>  let think u two have same mind and taste|`|U0wNL79Zaa	Be YOURSELF<br>  if its means more to him naturally let him come to you<br>  if not<br>  let it go|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	Well be very blunt with him, make sure he likes you back though. so just do your thing girl! and get ya man!!!!|`|UdICTUnaaa	pretend he doesnt exist. hes been told that you like him, its his turn tos how intrest... dont make yourself look clingy or desperate.... just pretend like he doesnt exist and play hard to get<br>  it works every time<br>  <br>  edit: these people answering are kids too.. they are leading you astray if you follow any of their advice. men are natural hunters and dont like to be hunted. if he knows you like him, its up to him now, act like he doesnt exist, i promise it will work. pretend like youve moved on and dont even think about him|`|1jIzBUkhaa	get his phone number, take to him ever change you get . look into his eyes , smile  and if he likes you more then he will ask you , but all the girls are after him so you need to work fast. phone number would be the best  and fastest way.|`|FzFSzilmaa	this is why children shouldn't date... if he isn't gonna take you seriously, then maybe he isn't mature enough...|`|jNmXo24Waa	stay aaa-waaa-ay. don't get involved. give him time 3wks.- 4wks. but no more. play it coy baby.
aXOyK3uBaa	No.... who tod you that?<br>  <br>  What kind of guy would be "scared" of just wanting to "ask" a girl out. If he's "scared" of that, he's going to be "scared" of kissing her, and going to be <br>  <br>  Besides, he doesn't even know her.<br>  And since he doesn't now her - she doesn't "mean" anything to him.<br>  <br>  And since she means nothing to him.....<br>  Her "rejection" will mean nothing to him too.<br>  <br>  Simple really.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|AA11266289	fear of rejection....|`|wGKBuipYaa	The fear of rejection! It takes alot to ask a girl you that you care about because you can be afraid of what the answer might be. I can ask 20 girls out that i just met and not care either way but if i care about her that's a whole different ball game. Its great when the guy gets a hint that when he does ask he will get question he wants.|`|bPJ9bVtcaa	Fear of rejection. Plus, if she rejects you, she will tell all her friends, then they will tell more, and in 1 day, the whole school knows. -.-
56LJzg3baa	it would probably be better to ignore the flirting and change the subject,  making a move on someone elses boyfriend is always a bad move, and if you are not into him, then surely just being friends isnt so bad|`|TU5dogKmaa	Hmm if he has a girlfriend , don't flirt back . If he likes you , he should just break up with his gf.|`|9nOQlbwEaa	I think you are a beautiful and a charming lady, so he cannot resist your smile, well, take it as a friend that admire your beauty and nothing beyond that.|`|eM3tXyqBaa	I suggest that you ignore him because he already has a girlfriend. It is not nice to be a third party right? Just take his attraction to you as a compliment|`|Xi2lGjKyaa	i think he is more comfortable spending the time with u than his girl so want spend more time with u so he comes again and tell see tmrow he go<br>  he likes u|`|I2gs5opxaa	being friends is nice|`|WseBc2Ydaa	just continue making friends with him.. if he really likes you he will go for you and broke up with his gf.. do not entertain his flirty attitude.... always play safe and continue play his game|`|BguZ2KUraa	:) it depends..really... if he is flirting with you..i dont see why you can't flirt bac to him =) hope it works out x
SL1bsp4zaa	I think it's a good idea to keep some space in the beginning, but not too much, because you don't want to lose contact with the person and forget about each other. If you are female, allow the guy to call the shots. If you are male though, I would suggest giving the girl some space. Sometimes girls can run away from guys who crowd their space too quickly. If you can tell she really likes you, then it really varies, but I would suggest talking or hanging out every other day at most. If you guys are both busy people then definitely space it out more if you can.. you can text a daily if you want, but keep in mind that if you are the kind of person who can't keep that up, then that can really hurt the relationship later on if you don't keep it up. Setting a precedent, such as texting or calling every day, can be a bad idea, because if you later decide that you really can't talk or text everyday.. then your girl friend might get frustrated or nervous if you don't text or call her daily. Just be careful because a relationship can go down hill really fast if you set precedents, and then fail to continue them down the line. Good luck!|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	at the beginnig i don't find that i need too much time alone .

2pxGPcxaaa	A rebound relationship is a distraction. It is a connection to another person that keeps us from having to experience the full extent of the emotional pain of our resent break up. It is a misguided attempt to move on with our lives. Many people will jump back into the dating scene because they fear being alone. It’s a quick fix, one in which we can drown out our pain by reveling in the emotional intensity and passion of a new found love. It can be a a lot more fun that dealing with the misery of a recently broken heart.

In fact most of them will be bad, and they won't care much about you. They'll just love your body and you don't want that. You need to also be smart, confident, and assertive. Don't fall in love with just any guy you meet, but make sure he's a good person first.|`|s5F745gBaa	Looks are part of the situation, but no one wants to be with a hag.<br>  A person with good looks, a calm, kind and gentle nature, smart, wise, and friendly is sure to get a really good partner.

Some people who are help others out feel that they are entitled to tell them what to do because they are now endebted to them.  And putting that on a relative only magnifies the whole problem.  Question for me is does your daughter still need the tutoring sessions?  I mean even if she is doing alright now does that mean it will be that way next month.  It seems that what you are having the most trouble with here is with confrontations, they seem to be something that when you go into one you have to win and you will do it at all expenses.  Don't do that.  The one thing I'm thinking about is the tutor.  Why didn't you just tell her you would talk to her after you were done with your supper?  I would have.  Then I would have sat down and told her how everything is making you feel as a mother and a parent.  All without losing your cool.   People who lose their cool do so because they are control freaks, everything has to be their way.  They have to find a middle ground.  Like telling the tutor that you would like for your daughter to continue but the past has made it uncomfortable for you, that she should have a little more tact about who and what she talks about.  That you can see your daughter coming back if she wants to honor that understanding.  Then stick to your guns.  Once she has made the agreement she has to uphold it, if not keep your daughter at home.  Sometimes it's hard to hear what someone is tellling us if we are ready to argue with them.  I used to do that, it only made things worse.  Now I let others have their opinions and I listen, then I take what I feel is best for me out of it and leave the rest.  But I also had some help in understanding what was actually best for me.  I had to let go of controling.  Life is simplier now and much easier.  If you would like to chat more drop a line, I'll do what I can to point you in the right direction and give help in difusing things.  good luck

8XKmMBU7aa	If you can't find any other person, you should kill her girl friend.<br>  or it does not matter that how many girl friends or wives does a man have. You also may live with him or you may say him that he may live with you in extra house 12 hours and can live with his other girl friend 12 hours. <br>  You are rude one, don't have words to say you anything.<br>  You still want to cheer him, die bast ard.<br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.|`|AA11899313	Just let him know that if he needs to talk or be supported, then you're around.<br>  <br>  Don't meddle or be seen as if you are poking your nose in.

rTLWzNCOaa	it could be now that because your a mum he now sees you in a different light maybe.  me & my husband have 2 children & we go through dry patches, but never that long.<br>  <br>  to get him to give you an answer as to why he wont have sex with you, maybe you could ask him in a different way. e.g i need to know why you wont have sex with me? because i need to know where i stand with you & how you feel about me. i love you but i need to feel like a woman sometimes & not just a mum, im going mad & i need to know what the problem is?<br>  <br>  i hope i didn't ramble to much, but with men its how you ask them, call me manipulative but that's what works best for me.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Make yourself over, get in shape, do kegals and i'm sure you won't be able to keep him off you.|`|X7rPWJU8aa	wow  .   .   .<br>  I would  ask him in a non sexual setting to explain to you why he is so turned off by the idea of sex. write him a letter if its the only way to keep him from blowing up. and also explain to him that you have needs and desires. <br>      i don't see a man just totally loosing his sex drive there is a serious problem. I have heard that some men loose their desire for sex when they have witnessed the birth of a child. but i don't see it affecting them to the point that it just stops them dead in there tracks like you describe.<br>   consider all possibilities and if he still wont open up consider leaving him.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	Maybe, ever since you had the baby to him it's a turn off to have sex with you. He doesn't want to put his c*ck in a hole where a baby came out of. <br>  <br>  Or, he could be getting the sex else where.|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	ask him to go to counselling with you if he not prepared to do that tell him if he wont do anything then tell him you want him to go if that don't shock him then it looks doomed.|`|VPkuM2xWaa	He has gone off you.|`|n9vByQgdaa	Cheat :P|`|Bt1D1wWuaa	Besides what most of the others have said regarding seeing you in a different light now that you've given birth or maybe just need to lose a few pounds.  If your pretty sure it's neither of those the only other thing I can think of is maybe he cheated while you were pregnant and now he has contracted some kind of disease?  Maybe Herpes?  That would be kind of hard to hide.|`|CHazGLY3aa	call me, i haven't had a bj in several months...lol...  tell him that it doesn't always have to lead to sex but you enjoy it, you like pleasing him, tell him what your needs and desires are...if you're important to him he should want to please you and give you what you need....|`|FzFSzilmaa	maybe he doesn't know how to tell you that your "stretched" body doesn't turn him on anymore...<br>  <br>  lose the baby body and see if that helps things...|`|Rgj6kTOwaa	this sounds very odd..hmm you say that you havnt had much sex since your child was born, well how much were u having before this?? can i ask did he watch what happened to you down below as u were giving birth?? do you think this might have i dont know..scared him of a little and now when ever he thinks about sex he can only think about what happened to you in child birth? might sound strange but it could be that! maybe u shudnt talk about it, dont make him think about sex at all and then say when he is like stood in the kitchen or something, go up behind him and just start kissing his neck and then reach your hand down to touch him and just start doing it, without saying a word he might just fall into doing it and then realise what he has been missing! then if he starts enjoying it carry on and guide him inside you, jus whatever u do dont mention that ur going to do it, want to do it, or even thinking about it lol!! this cud help! other than that im at a loss, whn u speak to him dont let it jus revolve around sex, just say we havent been connecting lately and its really getting me down, and maybe say that u cant see a future together carrying on like this, because to be honest there isnt much of one is there?? and im guessing he wudnt be up for like counselling together things like that? i hope u sort things out hun let us knw :)|`|p5u10SwLaa	Smh....<br>  If I was in that situation I would ignore him I would take care of my baby pass right by him like <br>  Whateverr F*you <br>  u are trying You know <br>  Do this....<br>  have lil fun times wit ur baby he might wanna join just don't ask him<br>  <br>  Work on urself go out to ur friends house with the baby if u have too<br>  Go work on yourself like workout do your hair and get some new clothes<br>  Be the best you possible and he's gonna want it again<br>  Just don't sweat him<br>  Ppl don't like dat<br>  He might be cheating but <br>  "u don't know" so let it go till you catch him red handed by mistake not bcuz u felt like being a dectective<br>   and when u are working on urself u might not really care { u will but not as much as b4} and if u wanna break up you can argue with him about it cheating or complain about your situation but its not a good idea<br>  <br>  <br>  Mira~ don't complain to him juz cuz he  is not fully committed don't complain <br>  Please do it for urself 4 ur baby.. Go do something for urself or the baby everyday even if don't have enough cash let him see u pay attention to urself * :)

OMG!!!!!|`|ICjBorriaa	unless someone is not telling the truth, this sounds horrible! she must not be aware of here surroundings or something. You should dump her immediately.  Especially if you were not getting lots of sex in exchange for all those dinners.|`|tBaCFTtBaa	yeah, she sounds like she doesnt appreciate it at all.. that is a lot of money on food!  lol.  seriously, you need to tell her that you've done without just for her to have a nice dinner on several occasions.. good luck.|`|aJKpiFBlaa	lol, dude, there are better things in life rather than these trivial junk. geez people these day. i feel old coz your concerns are this immature. no offense!|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	You count how many times you've gone out to dinner?

Your girlfriend seems very unappreciative. To some point, it should bother you. I'd say that you need to hand her the facts and see how she reacts before doing anything else. Good luck.
heMWDrLnaa	just be straight up with her - tell her how you feel and see if she feels the same way. if she doesn't then move on to the next girl.|`|NgawN7Pcaa	lol yeah why not? what is that other girl going to do? if you don't like her then shes going to have to get over it ( i mean that in the least harsh way )|`|FIvA9OVxaa	i dont think so thats what i do when a girl is sending me mixed signals i just go up to them and flat out ask them if they like me or not if they say no then thats that but if they say yes i go out with them a few times and if i like them back i go for it so just go ask her the worst thing she can say is no|`|SpANjSy7aa	i dont think it would be too forward and stupid..personally i would like it if a guy talked to me clearly and just plain and forward asked me what he was wondering...so go for it the worst you can do is stay wondering if she likes you..|`|0917sYkqaa	Ask her cuz she might like you back.

4bX4toFMaa	Honestly Bro, hold off on sex until she's comfortable. it will make all the better, she'll know that your not with here for that one reason. and you'll know she's a keeper if she doesn't jump to it as soon as you got with her. All sex does is complicate things, Rub one out til' she's ready... Hope this helps|`|FzFSzilmaa	respect her or dump her... your choice...|`|EXe6Kbhkaa	Take Things Very Slowly. Text Sex Is No Where Near The Same As Real Sex. She May Feel That Because Other Women Have Given You Sex, She Has To Do The Same To Keep You. Suggest Going Out For A Meal Or Snuggling With A Movie And Takeaway Combo And Show Her That You Love Her For Her, Not For Her Body. She May Feel That Sex Is All You Want, So By Doing This It Helps Her To Put Faith Into The Relationship. Wait For Her. By Doing This It Shows You Are Serious About Her, Not Just Trying To Get Her Into Bed. When The Time Happens, Take Things Very Slowly. And Before You Move On To The Next Stage Check She Is Comfortable With It First. Don't Just Assume That Just Because She Is Happy With A Bit Of Touching Doesn't Mean She's Happy For Oral Sex Or More.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	just jerk off and wait til she's ready|`|eShseKNWaa	buy a blow doll(:<br>  <br>  rofl.

d9tCS7BPaa	Probably masturbate earlier that day, have a couple of drinks before sleeping with her, tipsy but not drunk. I don't know how but this usually allows me to last for a while. While we are doing it, I make sure my pace doesn't get too fast...if I feel like I am getting close I will slow it down a bit and close my eyes and think of something else non-sexual until I can control it a bit more. Also, I feel like sometimes if I have alot of lights on in the bedroom or wherever, I can see her more and then I *** faster. So not seeing her gets rid of the visual stimulation so I would say dim the lights as much as you can or do it in the dark.<br>  <br>  Edit: Also, why are all these women answering this question? Didn't you all see the 'MEN ONLY' part? I guess they think they know our own bodies more than we do.|`|BuGz6eU9aa	sleep with my wife an hour before i sleep with my girlfriend.  that usually makes me last longer.  thinking about a brick wall instead of the sex sometimes works too|`|VvNKTFhJaa	most of the times half in and occasionally totally in. This tactic increases the time.|`|U3ZJzfDQaa	sleep|`|msoDXmvuaa	you need to take testosterone boosters.  i take tnt it is very natural it comes from tribulus plants which naturlaly allows your testicles to just produce more test in your body.. and if u do not last longer u will sure wanna have sex alot more often but take for a whole week and u will then see how many more times u want it then normal|`|aEUAhBzBaa	b4 u have sex masturbate the 1st time is always unpredictable after that if you fell your going to finish pull it out and play it off like ur just moving it will buy you some extra time..|`|IsFHBShoaa	i agree with "endzo"<br>  you have to masterbate first <br>  or<br>  have her give you head<br>  c*m<br>  and then go at it!|`|xBgKqAPHaa	take it slow, . go deep some times and fast the other times, just not so fast that you blow your load

What did he mean by that?  He's surprised that you're still calling him "baby" when you caught him cheating.<br>  <br>  Well, technically he's not cheating if you two aren't boyfriend/girlfriend.  He hasn't made any commitments to you, or you to him.  He can date other women if he wants, and you can date other men.  If you want to be in an exclusive relationship with someone, you have to find someone who wants to be in an exclusive relationship with you.  He obviously isn't it.  You either decide if that's ok with you, or you move on.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	It means he was totally prepared for you to dump him for disrespecting you and he can't believe you're such a moron you'd let him get away with it.|`|l1KlZrAOaa	So you have a problem with him dating another girl and then you sent him a text saying "good morning baby"?

It doesn't sound like you know what you want or you aren't telling him what you want (a committed relationship).  Leave the games to high school..

She says she's been trying to get rid of those feelings right? Then, if she hasn't been able to do that yet, then, she can't be with anyone right now. When u wanna start a new rtelationship its cuz ur ready. There's no I still have feelings for my ex bullshit.!!!! I don't know how can you think that she loves you. Love is giving everything for the person you love, and when you're in love, the only person you think about is your boyfriend or girlfriend. Not ur ex. I will recomend you two to take a break from each other. And let her decide what she wants to do. Cuz right now she's confused. Even if she says she wants you, she's confused. Don't continue playing this game. You will get hurt big time cuz I know you do love her. Take some time off, if she loves you, she will come back to you. If she doesn't, then it wasn't meant to be. And you will be saving a lot of tears....|`|rs7BYB1maa	do all of the things which she loves... whether its the zoo or shopping, seaside or restaurant... she should have so much fun she will start to think she doesnt need this other guy for fun. also it sounds stupid, but sleeping with her could help :P if  you already have, then develop some more interesting moves which could please her. you can beat her ex!|`|QlUNyK4Paa	well if she talks to him, tell her to stop.<br>  and maybe her and her ex are meant to be or something..<br>  maybe you shuld tell her yall need to take a break and let her figure out her her feeling or watevers.|`|56XwyVW9aa	Ask her if things were so perfect then why did they break up!

GOOD LUCK!!!!!!|`|GrCj35muaa	My suggestion, leave her since she has feelings for him still. If her feelings for you are as strong as she admits, this will get him out of her mind and you will be who she is missing. if she doesn't then she never had the feelings for you that she claimed and you are better off.|`|vRFNZb39aa	if she's worth it, help her through it. if she's not...this is really hard for you. and i suggest going for a girl who only loves you. that does exist out there..never forget what you deserve.|`|Xi2lGjKyaa	find out from her what make her think about her ex<br>  so act towards what she like<br>  inspire with u attitude <br>  do more in what she like

So everytime he speaks to you or asks you a question shrug your shoulders or look away. They will soon figure out something is wrong with you and when he asks all you say is you dont want to be with someone who treats you like s**t. Or you can just tell him to stop treating you like an idiot because you know what he has done. Dont tell him what he has done, make him tell you.

YiY9Yd2Jaa	There is no way that anyone should forget a part of their past - that is unreasonable. What he should do is stop talking about them.<br>  <br>  Quite often a guy will talk about past relationships because they are feeling insecure with the girl who they are with and feel that reinforcing the fact that other women find him attractive will make him more appreciated by the current lady. Of course it doesn't work that way, but many fail to see that. <br>  <br>  All you can do is have a serious conversation with him, explain that it is not how people in a relationship behave and that you would really appreciate it if he stopped doing it.|`|9bdEPcWIaa	He's a loser|`|WIurOBbDaa	He is insecure about himslef around others...|`|aJKpiFBlaa	you're probably feeling uneasy for a reason. maybe you two aren't on the same level. you need to figure out what you want and what you won't tolerate. people don't change when they don't think there's anything wrong/ they're out of line. either way, put yourself first b/c he's not gonna do it nor will anyone else.|`|IpWTMetHaa	Maybe he still has not resolved some of those issues!!! Just b careful, girl.|`|Lrrwu7yzaa	hes a pig|`|vRFNZb39aa	its really not cool that he's talking about anyone but you. he sounds a little egotistical, or maybe insecure...trying to prove that he's a player or something. i suggest you tell him calmly that you really don't like when he talks about other girls. mention that it doesn't do anything positive for your relationship and that it makes you feel insecure.<br>  <br>  be really honest and real. if he still does it, move on...|`|5dTqcpMzaa	Normal? Sure.<br>  <br>  I know I wouldn't want to put up with my girlfriend incessantly chatting about her ex's. It does put up a few red flags as to his dedication to you and his maturity.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself:<br>  <br>  What makes you happy?<br>  <br>  What do you want to hear?<br>  <br>  This is the way he is and chances are he isn't going to change.|`|55Xq3a5Laa	In a way I think its healthy to be able to express those things but at the same time, the past should be the past. If its something you don't enjoy listening to then I think he should respect that to some extent, but causing him to bottle those things inside could cause problems.|`|MDTj4U75aa	What a butt-hole.  My opinion is that he wants your attention and is insecure.  He probably does want you to think that he is tough or something.|`|mfmdFhsjaa	Dear he is wrong..<br>  either he is trying to compare yo with others...or he thinks its just friendship..<br>  you need to sort it out..|`|rjkd1pHyaa	girl friend ZZZ that means your at best a bronze sorry girl ditch him and move on|`|mDBHMJPjaa	noo thats stupid you need to let him know that  that in not right and make it clear!!|`|lXBVrik7aa	Tell him that you are glad he's being honest with you but you don't really like talking about that sort of thing. Make sure he knows it's making you uncomfortable and a little nervous. He should understand this but if not, just say, "I'd rather not talk about that, sorry." Hopefully he will understand that. If not, maybe you shouldn't be together, he seems a bit strange..<br>  <br>  Really hope it helps.

No girl should ever have to deal with constant reminders about ex girl friends. YOu should bring up your past flings and give him a taste of his own medicine and see if he likes it. Or you could be straight out and tell him to keep his past history and not to mention his ex's infront of you , and ask him to put him self in your shoes. ALso look at his culture, some cultures the man tends to walk all over their woman as something normal. Its not ok for him to do that. And he need to take a class on on human communication on relationships and how they work..he cant contsantley keep  burning you with his word about other woman. You have to tell him how you feel and be firm, let him know you are serious, even if it mean outting your foot down. If he doesnt stop, Then if i were you , i would think twice about his true love for you..honestly.|`|jbV0rH5vaa	hehe ive been there hunnie my best advise to you is when he does that start talking about other exes and then later in the converstiaon be like..how does it feel?..and he will be like what and say talking about my exes? and then he knows how you feel and then try and work on ways to talk about other things guys kind of run out of things to say so it slips there mind around you maybe he just is so lost in you that he doesnt know the fact hes hurting you but if i was you talk to him sister :) keep your head up and if that dont work dump is --- and know there more fish in the sea;) ..always here for ya:) hit me up sometime if u need me<br>  troublemaker2010@yahoo.com
cx3JwCgraa	If you think there is a chance, go ahead and do it. She might say no, and it might make things very awkward. Who knows, maybe she says yes. Maybe she says no but is cool about it. Just ask yourself if in 5 years, are you going to look back at it and kick yourself for not saying something? If the answer might be yes, you owe it to yourself to go for it.|`|6JAPrw21aa	It doesn't sound like a match made in heaven, true. But if You like her then good for you mate!  <br>  With a girl like that, and lets face it, we all know one, you need to make sure she likes you before you make a move or she'll make mince meat of you/ it will spoil what you already have. So, I suggest, play the field a bit, go out with someone else for a while. That doesn't mean using someone, but if the girl in question gets jealous, then that's your key to move in! <br>  Good luck!<br>  Have fun :)|`|5IsWhzHCaa	She sounds very dominating.

FXZLNc1aaa	Go slow with him, he's hurting right now, regardless of the breakup. I can relate to his problem, believe me. It's going to take a while for him to trust anyone, but please be patient w/him. If you dig him, and he digs you, then by all means, stay w/him and try to show him that you're not going to stray. Like I said, it will take time for him to trust again, regardless of the situation. He feels hurt, confused, and  betrayed, but that doesnt mean he wont/doesnt like you.<br>  <br>  Give it time......show him how much you care about him. Tell him that you can't be her, but that you can be you, and do nice things for him. prove yourself to him. Tell him he makes you crazy, and show how much you dig him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you my dear.|`|EHujGe5Oaa	Give him a chance, but let him know that you are not comfortable hearing him talk of the ex. <br>  <br>  It might be difficult for him, especially if he has been wining for 3 years. If you see he is making an effort, help him out (that is if you really like him).<br>  <br>  But if he continues talking of the ex, then you better take care of your self early. Coz that will be a sign of difficulties ahead <br>  <br>  All the best, always give love a chance.

738eb3523fcda7312e683aec70d06ce8aa	Stop waiting for the shallow guys to come to you and go out and meet some of the better men. And stop giving in to shallow men's demands easily.|`|Bi51WJd7aa	You can't make anyone want to be something more, or be different. Only the individual can change their behaviour or intentions. You have to keep in mind that it's not you and you're not doing anything wrong. Guys have their own minds and should be mature and wise enough to do the right thing and not behave like a**holes.<br>  <br>  I do have to ask you this though : Do you dress appropriately? The way a woman dresses is usually a great determining factor in the type of guys she attracts. If you dress like a sl*t then more then likely, 'those' guys will just want to be with you for that reason because they see you as easy (and they are easy too!) ... Other than that, you just need to focus on being yourself, being confident and self-assured. <br>  I have good news for you : Great, decent guys are out there, they may just be a bit tougher to come by then the rest of them. I know that personally (I met the most amazing guy in the world whom I now call my fiance, after being with a few losers). Just be patient, enjoy your life and he will come along.<br>  <br>  P.S - Love may find you when you least expect it! ;)|`|iMGeSGdcaa	don't put out on the first date...they are only making you look bad and if you continue down this path of no self respect.|`|fwnlY9viaa	Don't sleep with them and refuse (not so nicely) if they're expecting it.<br>  Look at the way you dress and act, could this be sending messages you're not intending to?<br>  It could also be the type of guys that you are attracted to (that was me), reassess your values and ideals and look for someone new and different.
wE7lLCHSaa	Your daughter is your first priority.  If your romantic feelings are more important than she is, then you don't deserve to have her.<br>  <br>  Hollywood schlock movies tell us to follow our hearts (and other gender-specific organs) and bail out on a relationship when the going gets rough.  Don't believe it -- it's just a bunch of lies.  Real life relationships involve sacrifices, needs, demands, confrontation, temptation, all of it.  It sounds like you are going through all the normal stuff people go through in real adult relationships.  Keep at it.  Nothing worth having is easy, and no relationship will ever come without challenges.  <br>  <br>  You could try to maintain a friendship with your ex, but I think that's probably asking for trouble.  If he's not worth screwing up your daughter's life for, it's probably best to stay away from him.<br>  <br>  My girlfriend and I fight all the time and we wouldn't have it any other way.

But if she is not I would like us both to get tested.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	If he wants a virgin then he needs to remain a virgin.<br>  Fair is fair.
i4bjQbPcaa	It's normal.  She is married to you.  <br>  <br>  Why did they split up?  Was it a bad break up or did it just fizzle out?  If it just fizzled out then it is very possible they are still friends.  She is not keeping anything from you, I would have been more worried if she had hidden this from you and you had found out by accident|`|RmVSz5j2aa	Oh yes. I am friends with quite a few of my exes. I hide nothihg from my husband. He can have all of their numbers. Meet them, anything he wants. It is NOTHING more than friends. If you don't love your friends as friends, then why have them. There are a few people that didn't work out when we were together, but are still friends. and my hubby knows he has nothing to worry about. Now when you hide the relationship, that is the time to worry. But as long as you knew RIGHT from the start that they were talking, then no, there is nothing wrong with it.|`|5KMDaiXwaa	Honestly I dnt think it is possible to love ur ex as a friend. There will always be a connection with your ex if u stay friends with them even if they say they are only friends but the question u gotta ask urself is do u trust ur wife enough to believe it. I personally would hate if my partner was texting his ex I would be spitting chips about it, I think it is immorally wrong to do to your partner.|`|0SoDvjU7aa	yeah its normal when i had my 1st phone i loved the ring tone & the dial pad it was a nice number as well but now i've got another phone & she is much nicer with loads of hidden features i love to explore,& also this comes with a new number i could of kept my old number but i fancied a new one but i still think of my ex number quite often|`|dSMb8JDvaa	If me,(woman view) I won't like it and I will tell my husband to slowly stop it..or tell him to tell the ex that My wife feels disrespected and upset and they should stop. But my husband he said it's Okay but he doesn't like it though so if I love him I have to slow down or try to avoid this.|`|5oks25XVaa	If they were friends first then probably. I bumped into my ex the other day and he has text me a few times. We were good friends first and now we are more like that again which is nice. Id say it is very possible to love them as a friend, especially since they have both moved on. She will be with you for a reason|`|e8aa8e418b72c63acc3e4ab908f8a79baa	NO NO NO NO ..... steer well well clear of this B.S. Put your mark in the sand or wherever it is clearest and dont, i repeat DO NOT budge... it is the biggest Bull storey ever. It will lead to pain. Leave the past in the past, if she can`t then you better have a good look at where you going. Listen to your instinct, listen very closely... if it goes against my advise, listen to it.|`|jTtNE6dmaa	No.  It's trouble waiting to happen.  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it will happen.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	my gf has been married for about 25 years and her best friend is a guy that she used to date.  so, yes it seems possible.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	i thought so, until my wife started using him for emotional support instead of me and then left me for him.|`|87b6887f8f3651f24e111ac966c0f89daa	Yes, I am friends with most of my ex partners. And we are literally Just friends as I love my current partner. She doesn't even meet up with him just texts him, you have nothing to worry about . They spent a time together when they saw each other a lot, it's hard to cut out a person completely just because you've broken up.|`|v0P0vay0aa	no no|`|PY160XO7aa	Yes it is, but SHe married time to cut ties|`|QwXIsKAhaa	yep it is!<br>  :)
m3ThrbDMaa	You have to find them, show a lot of leg, smile a lot, brush up against them accidently, and purr like a kitten when you tell them that you want to go to the Jonas Brothers concert with them...|`|WQ1sjTPDaa	send me email|`|2vgbJhlRaa	be confident in yourself! act like you dont give a **** about what people think about you, be yourself, if guys dont like you for that then f*** em and move on, theres plenty of people that will like you for who you are. and it sounds like your still young, many guys will be all over you soon enough. NEVER say your ugly, different people have different preference in people. stay positive about yourself and you will shine like the northern star. best of luck :)|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	LOL.<br>  <br>  do you have any friends that go to other schools?<br>  if you do just go to their partys meet their friends and<br>  BAM you 've got a boyfriend. just let your guard down;)|`|738eb3523fcda7312e683aec70d06ce8aa	Hahaha, don't hate a guy just for wearing glasses! If the glasses bug you he can always wear contacts. Now you make guys like me feel bad, though I don't really need glasses I still wear them most of the time.
iMGeSGdcaa	talk about his hobbies, his siblings, his pets...<br>  go to google and look up conversation starters...it helps a lot|`|KxAmrVBfaa	Um I would say you're not right for each <br>  <br>  Because you are so young I can that can happen though<br>  <br>  If u guys dont keep a convo going later on in the relationship then theres something wrong because u should be feeling awkward there your bf!!<br>  <br>  My boyfriend is like one of my best friends I can say anything to him|`|ptDHZK7Jaa	well i sometimes talk to my ex and we talk sooooo much about everything and anything there is never a silence and with my boyfriend its different i dont know what to talk to him about i kinda feel like im not myself all the time just to please him we talk about sex a lot n sometimes i think we togetha 4 sex but i think there is a ton of things to talk about but at the moment they never pop up i honestly think including myself a relationship were u have nothin to talk about is pointless so dont take it any farther or talk to him if u wanna stay with him|`|xXiCghR4aa	try talking online or on a web cam. Sometimes it's easier to talk online than just on the phone so you guys can see eachother. My boyfriend and I suck at talking on the phone but we're cool on cameras hehe.|`|jpF5rd2Paa	talk about anything|`|du5MNrQ6aa	ohhh mmm geee<br>  <br>  talk about what you are totally going to wear! "going out" means you listen to each others noises in the house...why don't you chat online or text?|`|mCpC4Zjbaa	That used to happen to me! I was so awkward when I was younger lol. Actually ... younger?... sometimes I still am. Phone conversations can be kind of hard when you don't know the person very well. <br>  <br>  Try to ask him questions that will spark his interest and get him talking. A lot of guys don't like talking on the phone though, so I think it would be a lot better if you just talked in person when you hang out. Once you get more comfortable with eachother phone convos won't be hard anymore because they'll come naturally. <br>  <br>  good luck girlie =)|`|8e6f671107760e695bd9b4f9a1ddab06aa	talk about anything. if yall have the same classes at school. or the same friends. movies. music. hobbies. anything. my boyfriend is my best friend. it was weird at first, but it'll get easier. good luck!|`|Z3mHGD5Yaa	You are both immature and have no communication skills.

klYCoFJVaa	I agree with the first answer.  If you lucked out with a beautiful, smart girlfriend, then treat her well.  It's not everyday a girl dates a guy simply because she likes him.  :)|`|y4zYkceEaa	Doubting yourself? Yes, you may be a normal guy but it doesn't mean you don't have a beautiful soul.

f46369427ac23f51a8717fcf25bfb72aaa	It's not always the best to go out with someone when you are still feeling devastated, you need to completely heal because you can actually still carry your negative feelings into a new relationship....not something you want to do. Since you are already seeing someone, take it slow and explain it to him that you want this to work, but you want to take it slow.|`|nmiIHzczaa	Whether you date this person or not, the pain from losing your last lover will be with you for a long time. It will only help you move on and past the last person by having good times with a new person. The beginning of the relationship is always the best so why not enjoy being with someone instead of sitting at home alone just feeling sorry for yourself  for being alone. I am dealing with trying to get over my ex as well, and what did I do on saturday night? I went out on a date, and it was nice to get myself back out there and feel wanted again, even if it was just for a few hours until I went home alone. <br>  <br>  I say go for it, whatever makes you happy is exactly what you should be doing.|`|s5F745gBaa	Not really, they'll help you put away your ex. But don't date someone else for revenge, that'll make things worse. And the guy you are dating has to be someone you like.|`|c325AREXaa	no,definitely not.you two are still not officially dating,so you are still seeing him as a frined,what's wrong?moreover,it's good to you,he makes you feel calm and happier.maybe you can do this,tell him how you feel,honestly,about your past,your feelings for him.then you won't have to feel guilty about it.hope that you can have a new wonderful relationship!^^|`|ccde40b80ab5dd4bbd26544e0b567c7eaa	There is no wrong or right in life my friend!  I think only YOU has the capacity to answer your question right now, cause only you can<br>  size up the extent of the psychological pain that is left in your wounded heart.  <br>  <br>  However, I do know how u are feeling right now! Nothing matters right! <br>  As if u entered the deepest **** hole of your life, and all that surrounds u is gray!  You breathe in and out , wake up each morning, observes what's around you, and others might see u there, except that " YOU AREN"T REALLY THERE" .  You are somewhere within the boundaries of  several questions, like what went wrong? You rock your mind to the memories of what used to be, and how it could have turned out if you did this or that, instead of that or this!  <br>  I have been there my friend, and I am sorry to hear of your PAINS! <br>  <br>  That too will pass, in the right time, in the right moment. <br>  You can't estimate the time , nor can you shorten the mourning<br>  of your heart, but I guarantee you, " just like that" - THAT TOO WILL PASS!   <br>  <br>  You have to remember one thing.  You are not alone, and no mankind<br>  had been exempted  from PAINS!  We might differ in the manner that<br>  we carry or handle our pains, but we are all the same .  For most of the readers of this letter, I think they will AGREE with me. <br>  <br>  It might HELP you to talk about your pains to your friends, a stranger, or a close confidant.  Talking eases the pain.  Get angry, express your innermost feelings if you have too, but never suppress it. Also, don't blame yourself on anything, say to yourself, It happened , I forgive myself, and affirm and say to yourself that despite it all<br>  you love yourself.   Sometimes, the greatest relief that we can get<br>  from the PAINS that we feel, is our our self assurance, our own<br>  forgiveness to what had happened, and above all our own ability to<br>  bounce back and live again.<br>  <br>  My friend, you are never alone, we all did experienced what u are<br>  going through now ..... I GUARANTEE YOU, that too will pass!!!<br>  <br>  Sweet happy thoughts to you my friend, and may you feel better<br>  in the days to come!

3iGUm5YFaa	There's 2 possibilities to this.<br>  1) he's jealous, that it is the friends are guys. <br>  2) The bad scenerio. He's hiding something from you that only he and his friends know.|`|5agXk9ldaa	well i think he does not trust his friends or he thinks like they are his friends and just want from a part to be free (if you are friend with his friends so i think you will stay together for a lot of time and guys hate that)|`|68PRp0BGaa	It sounds like he doesn't have much trust in his friends.|`|Ys3IRu7Xaa	That's kind of iffy. If he's the jealous type and he knows his friends are man whores or something, he may not want them to meet you because he doesn't trust you. However, if his friends are decent and stuff, and he still doesn't want to introduce you to them, I'd be concerned. Maybe you can set up a group date with your guy/girl friends and his guy/girl friends. See what he says to that.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Answer mine please: <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvhBmnnm5gtKQzDoHR5Dq8vsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223004958AAPJkCL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|wKuQC4yTaa	He may be jealous. He doesn't want you around them.  my husband told me some weird crap that boys use to do, like pass around girls basically, and he told me he didn't want me around them so they don't get to think that.  It sounds really disgusting but that's what he told me.|`|pdASSjn8aa	wow, well tell him that if he doesnt want you to get to know his friends that you think he doesnt think sbeing with you is serious|`|K3gEmRc0aa	He wants you for yum yumness, and them for Fun funness!|`|nmiIHzczaa	There could be several reasons, he may be ashamed of you, ashamed of his friends, maybe he thinks his friends will bring things up that he doesn't want you to know or you may bring up things that he doesn't want them to know. There are some guys that are so insecure that they don't want their gf to be out with the friends because of the fear that one of the friends will steal her away|`|s5F745gBaa	He's afraid you might like his friends more then him, because he just doesn't want to lose a friendship and a relationship at the one time and reason.<br>  And he may want to seperate societies to live in. One with you, the other with his pals so he can have comfort if one society disses him.<br>  Or he could be hidding something.|`|7oyaNbfSaa	Either he is embarassed of you, embarassed of them, or he's afraid that one of his friends might steal you away.|`|RZWiU7Jcaa	He's hiding something either how his friends are, His personal secret, Maybe he says things about you to his friends that he doesn't want you to know about.. Endless reasons, None good HAHA|`|lD1MBeAMaa	One of two reasons.<br>  1 - He's embarrassed of you.  <br>  OR...<br>  2.- He doesn't want you to go home with one of his friends!|`|citgf07Waa	What ever it is ............<br>  <br>  <br>  1--some of ur BF's frnd like u...........<br>  <br>  2---u mite be so beautiful that hez scared his frndz wud start luvin U........<br>  3--hez jealous that u hangout wid them more than wid him|`|67H4k1lgaa	boys night out|`|HqEdWTfIaa	he probably cheating on you and doesnt want you to find out. my ex was the same way|`|AA10721003	It means one of two things (both of them are probably not good)...<br>  <br>  1.  You are overwhelming him, and he wants savor his time apart from you to recenter himself.  You can't tone down your personality, then he's going to try to get away from you whenever he feels like you're getting on his nerves a bit too much.  If he can't feel comfortable with himself around you, then he's going to spend more time with his friends who let him be himself.  He doesn't want you to join him with his friends, because then he'll never be able to get away from you and be himself.  If this is the case you got two options: either mellow out sort of let him do his own thing when you two are hanging out together so he can enjoy being himself around you and want to spend more time together, or set him free to be with his friends and learn to respect those boundaries.<br>  <br>  2.  Something about his friends and you would be like mixing oil and water together.  Either they don't like you, or you probably won't like them.  It's probably better that you do NOT jump to hasty conclusions that he is talking behind your back with these friends.  At most he might be venting relationship issues, but he's probably not badmouthing you unless he's a total ******.  Everyone takes on different roles that makes up who they are as a whole person.  When he's with you, he takes on the boyfriend role, but when he's with his friends he takes on another role of his personality.  Perhaps he doesn't think you will like this other side of him or the personalities of his peers.  Or he recognizes that his peers will would not welcome some aspect of your personality.<br>  <br>  Best option is to smooth talk him a bit.  Get him to eat his favorite food, and talk about something he is interested in, then when he's feeling good, tell him there is something that's been on your mind and bothering you.  Ask him if he thinks there is anything about your personality that might bother him or others.  This is going to be hard, if you've never asked a question like this before, and the answer may hurt.  Let him get it all out in the open, and just listen with an open mind, but don't take anything personally!  Remember that you're a wonderful person inside no matter what.  Later on when you're alone, think about what he said and decide for yourself if any of his points were valid or not, and how honest you feel he being with you.  Then you have to decide whether or not you want to make positive changes to yourself or not.  Not many people want to change who they are for someone else, but people of amazing character and wisdom often decide to make positive changes to their own personality for the benefit of themselves.<br>  <br>  By making yourself into a more positive force, your boyfriend will enjoy having you in more parts of his life; even around his friends.|`|izUf4VeZaa	He must really like probly in love with you...

klYCoFJVaa	No offense, but the old line, "Bros before hoes," comes to mind.  Friends are usually more important to a guy than girlfriends.  If he truly had earlier plans, then forget about it.  Have fun with your Polish guy and maybe you can talk to Mr. German later.  He apologized to you and told you the reason, didn't he?  I would say that was gentlemanly.  At least, as gentlemanly as a guy gets now-a-days.|`|BwJOeHDEaa	damn, i wish i was european...well, i am, but..i wish i lived there...the us is totally lame|`|55Xq3a5Laa	He doesn't seem to be of any particular importance, just forget about it and have a good time!|`|nUDdh5Iqaa	?|`|mKtnY4Lhaa	germans are cool|`|msoDXmvuaa	haha gentlemen lines... hunny i would cheat on you every chance i got.. u must think ur gods gift

F2rI3Juaaa	You have indicated that you just got out of a relationship = perhaps he is just being cautious!|`|pdbc4souaa	He is waiting for you to make a move, or he is not attracted to women in a physical way. Ask him for a hug, then just before you release, back off a llittle, but leave your arms around his neck and look into his eyes. Move your lips into a "Kiss me, you fool" pucker. What he does next will tell you what is happening with him.|`|inST4SlAaa	he likes you but does not want to date you on the rebound.  these relationships usually fail.  give him his time until he comfortable that you both can have a serious boyfriend/girlfriend relationship.  he may have been hurt before.|`|R1zUIh7taa	This is something you need to ask him, it sounds like he likes you too!

So, tell everyone that has a problem with the relationship thing to f*** off and go for it. Its your happiness that matters, you can try your whole life to make everyone happy, all you're are going to do is make yourself unhappy and in the end you piss someone off anyways. I understand where you are coming from, I really do, but the people who really care for you will still be with you in the end. And as for your cousin/mom situation, I would just suggest having him come over to your house and stuff so your mom can get to know him, maybe do this before you start going out so your cousin can't turn your mom against him before he even has a chance to prove himself.

The thing is just because you are that type of friend, you can't expect everybody else to be that kind of friend. Don't do things for other people expecting something in return. Continue to be that type of person...because you when you do good for other people, it always benefits you and never them. Just because they aren't calling you doesn't mean they don't care. I don't think you should question your friendship with them over this. Give them time to call you or just take the time alone to get better. I think you are making a big deal out of nothing. My best friend and I can go for weeks some times without talking but I know that she still cares for me. Doesn't mean that I can't pick up the phone and call her whenever I need something.

And yes, he is using you. You need to tell him to get his butt out there and looking, and if he won't, you need to show him the door.

Love isn't materialistic however if he really cared about you, he wouldn't leave it up to you as if it's your responsibility and not a joint responsibility. He's also not willing to get a job because you're paying all of the bills. You need to show him tough love by refusing to pay any bills that's in his name. You're making it to comfortable for him at home therefore he's not willing to stop being a couch potato. He's seeing that you're now struggling to keep both of you afloat however he doesn't seem to care by looking for a job. He's a grown man and it shouldn't take you telling him that he needs to get a job. Stop asking him to get a job, worry about you and your bills from now on.

Although you may love him, and it's all there for you-- you need to put your foot down and end it. A relationship cannot be 95-5. It needs to be 50-50. If he wants to keep you, he needs to get a job and pay everything that you've paid for the last few months AND THEN some.<br>  <br>  He most likely is pulling the pity trick, where he tries to make you feel bad for his situation-- mainly so he continue to sit around and live off of you. <br>  <br>  You are NOT his mother, you are NOT going to be his little provider. You are too good for him, seriously. And you need to believe it, too.<br>  <br>  So do what is best for you, Dump him, and get someone who gives a crap that you're struggling!|`|OeRzlZPnaa	As much as you love him, your going to have to give him an ultimatum he's definitely using you at this point. He may not have been using you at first but I think he's enjoying the time off a little bit too much and if you don't give him an ultimatum to get a job or get out he'll never get a job, and if he still doesn't get a job he's not worth your time and you deserve better.|`|bEaJHY1uaa	no not far at all.  I think he's got so used to the fact of not working that he has became lazy, and yes this is a form of him using you.  You shouldn't have to struggle, he should have the decency to help out with the bills and especially if they are his.

This shows that the real issue is not solved yet. You can still be friend with him but you should keep your options open to other guys as this guy doesn't seems to appreciate you at all. <br>  <br>  The frequent breaking up between you and him shows that there are problems that both of you did not face it properly and getting back together easily does not really solve the main problem. Therefore, I would suggest that you keep a distance from him so that other guys will know that you are still single and available. Good Luck and wish that you can be happy as always.

lGByR3lcaa	It depends. Now this is an absolute trade secret for me, but I play guys that way. Especially when there aren't many customers. If you told me that "the strip club wasn't the right place to spend money on a girl", then I'd think that you would like to spend money on me but not right now. And if you asked my number I'd say no, I can't give it to you. Now, honestly, it's true that I don't give out my numbers for my security. I ask for the guy's number instead. Or if they ask me out or something like that, I will tell them that "I'll have to get to know you better before I can make any decisions" which improves my chance of getting a dance from them. And before they leave I'll ask them to come and see me again, which makes them think that I'm interested in them, and will come back to see me, and gives me another chance to work through them.<br>  <br>  Now, I have a nickname for being a professional heartbreaker. I have a talent for working guys through their minds. It's more likely that yes she is interested in seeing you again, but in her zone, because it's safer. I don't know, I've told you all my secret, but it's *my* secret.<br>  <br>  PS - strippers are usually independent contractors, they pay a house fee of between 10-20 dollars for the shift, and tip out a certain percentage of their dances. The manager/doormen will keep track of their dances so they can make sure they get tipped out right.<br>  <br>  PPS - Sometimes it's possible for me to actually want to see a customer again, especially if they treat me like a human being and not a stripper. It's a power play between the customer and the stripper.|`|7iwZRuUmaa	if you aren't going to drop some coin in a strip club then go to McDonald's. she didn't give you her number because she isn't in to you. she met you in a strip club duh! and yes she wants you back in because at least you will buy drinks--it's a rough economy a business will take what it can get.|`|AA10744889	They get payed to listen to you and be nice its their job|`|NrYuEuEwaa	who knows, never trust a stripper tho|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	Do you really think a stripper is going to date a guy she met in a strip club?

sIareS2Vaa	Think about it this way...women (and men) don't choose to feel attraction for someone. They might know in their minds that the "right" guy is the nice one who you described, but they feel attracted to the other guy.<br>  <br>  "You're too good for me" is her trying not to hurt your feelings because she knows you're a great guy, but you don't create any attraction or chemistry. Alot of the things you listed are seen as wussy behavior, and by that i mean: needy, over-accommodating, etc. and it kind of creeps girls out.<br>  <br>  Girls don't like jerks because they treat them badly. They like that they can't control or manipulate them, their attitude that "i dont need you. there are other girls out there", and other things they see as MANLY. Again, they don't think about this, it just happens. They also LOVE guys who tease them and poke fun at them (which i've recently worked on and learned firsthand) as long as its in a playful manner and not a serious one.<br>  <br>  Last thing I want to do is recommend subscribing to David DeAngelo's email newsletter.

Your question was EXACTLY the type that he addresses often.|`|XD8r5KPRaa	It's usually not something you can control.<br>  There is a person I know, who was very rude to me one night, and I don't like him because I have to see him all the time anyway, but somehow I can't stop thinking of him, looking at him when I see him, and doing anything to see him or talk about him. It's not like you can choose it. But usually it's how they act. They persuade you into doing something, into acting someway, into believing they care for you. Honestly - I prefer the good type. Not the bad.|`|6LJvAkF3aa	Perhaps you should take an advanced English class and learn about stereotypes and generalizations.

scyLaz0saa	A relationship is a two sided thing.  It requires both people to put the work and effort into it in order for the relationship to be successful.  Hmm it sounds like when it is new both of you get crazy for each other.  So why don't you try that certain days of the week.  Try a role-playing game.  Pretend to be different people and pick each other up at a bar or restaurant.  It might be a little spice to the relationship.  Maybe talk about some fantasies you both have. Try and fulfill them.<br>  <br>  Also what are her reasons?  Also is she on the pill?  When I was on birth control it killed my sex drive.  So that might be something to keep in mind.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good luck to you.

It all depends on you and if you're willing to let go or not.  It will be hard and it will hurt and some days you'll feel like it's never going to stop hurting, but it will.  You just have to figure in your heart and mind when you are ready to let go.  For me, personally, it took me a minute I dated other people and I tried relationships but my heart and my mind kept on going back to that clown.  One day, I met this guy, and everything just fell into place with him, it's like we connected on so many levels and that was so hard for me, because I was torn.  I was still hurt, but I realized one night while I was lying in my bed that he was still winning he still had control over my life.  I had to tell myself that I wouldn't miss out on anything else that God had been trying to send me (or not) because of him.  I refused to let him take anything else good away from me and that is when I truly healed from the inside out.  That's how me and my husband came to be.  So just pray to God for his help and strength through your hurts and pains and he will bring you through it; Let Go and Let God (he may just be removing that  problem from your life and preparing you for your solution in someone else.  Hope this helps|`|eNEgKxfJaa	honestly? it took me a year and a half to get over my first love... that long before i was ready to date someone else....<br>  <br>  but it probably took that long because i let it.<br>  <br>  i know its difficult but most of the time you break up for a reason. example - my sister dated this guy for 6 years, and it only took like 3 months to get over him and move on. the first month was difficult but she realised it was for the best.<br>  <br>  the best way to move on is to sever all contact with him and surround yourself with friends and people who love you. keep yourself busy and keep time to realise yourself and what it is you want before you let anyone attempt that. <br>  <br>  alot of this also depends on why you broke up.|`|ibOsXpkraa	it takes a week or so depending on how long you were in<br>  1 to 4 months-couple of days <br>  5-a year-a week or two<br>  12 months-24 months-at least 3 to 4 weeks<br>  3 years and up...about a month to a month and a half|`|f46369427ac23f51a8717fcf25bfb72aaa	You know everyone will give you little bits of things to help you try to get over someone, but no one ever thinks of the time in between all that...like when you go to sleep. When you lay your head on your pillow your thoughts start running around. Getting over someone takes time....and good people around you willing to help you. In my experience, I always say there is a reason for everything. The experiences that happen in your life are there to help you grow and understand. The only person who can really help you to get over something is yourself, with the help of people who love and care about you...your supporters. Healing takes time and support.|`|8e6f671107760e695bd9b4f9a1ddab06aa	if you loved him it will take time. me and my fiance broke up on Jan 1st this year and im still not fully over him.

That happened to me and it was a year ago. I still haven't really healed, but thats because i see him around a lot. Just try to do stuff that you like and don't think about him.

Just remember you have complete control over how you feel, the only time you'll feel better is when you let yourself.
klYCoFJVaa	Simple:  ignore him.  Arguing with him and talking about him will only make his ego larger.  My little brother is similar, but younger.  When you ignore him, he's going to throw a fit and most likely leave, but that doesn't matter, as long as he isn't throwing his ego around.|`|8xabuUl6aa	Try to distance yo selves from him. if he feels that hes hated, he might wanna change his ways. or provoke him by saying that he doesn't have much to be proud of cause hes just a kid. nothing much accomplished in life yet.|`|nMcjBv4saa	hes only 17 he will hopefully grow up one day|`|PGvxouUzaa	ignore him?if he doesnt talk to you not your loss
SMezBOmiaa	He thinks that you are the type to hang out with a lot of guys and have lots of guys for friends and nothing more. <br>  <br>  Being a tomboy kinda means acting like a guy so much that even guys want to hang out with you and be friends with you without really pursuing a girl-boy relationship or anything like that. Guys just like treating you as their buddy.<br>  <br>  I don't think he really means any offense from that comment.

She sounds like a retard.. anyway that's beside the point.. does the guy look like it could be her cousin? your gf isn't white and he's black or anything right? because that would be a definite indication that.. they are not cousins-- and yes you should be worried. But if you have no real proof other than the "i" thing.. I wouldn't be so accusatory of her.. unless you sense that she is lying to you. If you haven't already brought it up to much, I would ask her again.. look her in the eye, and when she responds, see if she looks away and doesn't look you in the eye--See if she studders. If she does any of these things, she could be lying. As far as the i thing, maybe he really respects her as a person/ cousin and thought it was super cool to do the "i" thing too and they have some sort of inside joke about it.. who knows. If she just set up the account for him though, it makes more sense that he would just now make her a top friend (and vise versa).. but do some more research before you make any assumptions.

Maybe they are hoping that they can change the guy<br>  you dont realise that nice boys are the way to go. they lack confidence and overall are 'too nice'<br>  <br>  when you get older and mature, most girls will switch and wake up to a  nice smart guy|`|vMKEg29kaa	Again generalization is not so cool.

RQtYkwXgaa	lol... don't worry about it, honestly guys get excited in that way for no reason at all sometimes...<br>  <br>  Heck just the vibrations while riding in a car or bus can do it... or a breeze at the wrong time.  So do not worry.  Guys get excited, in fact depending on the age, some guys will go around all but perpetually excited.  (Add to this the fact that males are normally more stimulated visually than any other way, so the fact that he gets excited at a movie of a topless girl is perfectly natural, it is an involuntary reaction.)|`|np5R16RSaa	you have to chill, take it easy, at least he is getting it when your beside him.<br>  its not about you, its nature, men do get turned one when the see a naked women and stuff like that.<br>  dont you???<br>  i mean would you get a little wet when you see a hot naked hunk?<br>  try it, watch porn and you'll get what i mean.|`|szJzZ9myaa	Dude's got a healthy sex drive, would you rather date a guy who had a soft noodle all the time?
cd87c1cf515692ef0adc60a28df772b0aa	Even if her hymen is broken, it doesn't mean she is not a virgin. Some women are actually born without hymens, plus many things besides sex can tear the hymen. Tampons, masturbation, exercise, riding a horse, riding a bike, etc. If she's ever had a pap smear. Hymens can be torn even without penetration, as I said, even riding a bike can potentially do it, prob. due to the pressure and maybe some bouncing. So even if her hymen is torn, it could have been caused by something other than sex. Also, if her hymen is absent, as I said, although rare, women are born without them. Due to this, not all women will bleed during sex even if it's the first time. Also, if the hymen is slowly stretched during foreplay (which you really should do- you should want her to be aroused, pleased, and try to avoid hurting her) and then sex, she also may not bleed. Sometimes, it doesn't happen. Also, when it does, it may be very little. So, really, you have to take her word on it.|`|JzyhBtokaa	If you can't trust her when she tells you she has been faithful, you shouldn't be getting married. Also, it's perfectly normal for a girl's hyman to be broken without having sex---e.g. by playing sports. Finally, if you love her, IT SHOULDN'T MATTER!!!|`|JPo9tglsaa	if u love her than it shouldnt really matter if shes a virgin or not. and if ur going to marry her soon than u should feel comfortable to just straight out ask her and if u did and she said shes a virgin than u should trust her after all u are going to marry her!|`|F7O0nLK1aa	if you dont trust her dont marry her. and it is more complicated than that hymen thing. i hate to be the one to clue you in, but maybe it was oral or anal.|`|wGKBuipYaa	her hymen could be broken and she could still be a virgin.

How often do you talk/hang out with her? If you mean mates as in -- you sit next to her in a class and talk every once in a while in class.. that is different than actually being friends. If the latter is the case than she could be trying to avoid you by looking away when you walk past-- this could be a very bad sign. Maybe she knows you like her and she doesn't want you to think she likes you back. <br>  <br>  If you are indeed friends and she looks away when you walk past, then I would either think she is embarrassed by you around certain friends so she doesn't want you to approach her (hence the looking away) or she just is busy and she doesn't want to talk.<br>  <br>  It is also possible that she is very young and immature and she looks aways because she is shy and really likes you and is afraid that you'll come try to talk to her so she wants to avoid it..but i doubt that too.<br>  <br>  Also it could be that she is looking away because she is friends with you, but she doesn't want you to think she wants more than friendship, so she avoids certain opportunities to talk for fear that you'll think she's into you...<br>  <br>  Good luck.. and sorry for the harsh news.|`|AA11271128	Well if she is your "mate" how come you aren't walking with her and just by?

She might not like you that much. or she is shy and needs to be communicated with properly. The only way you will find out is to act like your not afraid. Next time she doesnt look just say " Are you too shy to say HI to such a good looking guy?" or something like that. It's a warm and funny icebreaker that will show your confidence and sense of humour, which girls are attracted to. Girls hate wussy behavior.<br>  They are attracted to confidence combined with humour. Guaranteed!
uqSbj8WQaa	I think it just means whatever you want it to mean.  For the girls who are waiting til marriage for sex but will give oral every time, I suppose it doesn't mean much.  It does seem pretty hypocritical when you look at it from that point so I can understand where you are coming from.  I don't think you should feel alone or out of touch.  People like you may be less common but you know what you believe and it isn't wrong.  If it has meaning to you then it shouldn't matter if other people think it does or not.  Don't down on yourself for it.  Be proud of it.|`|AA11271128	Oral sex is something more than kissing it is a form of sex.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to do it or are uncomfortable about it don't do it yet.<br>  <br>  If you are relaxed about it then okay but it is more than just kissing and not everyone is doing it, they just aren't telling people out of fear of pear pressure of being seen as something wrong or of being some sort of person stuck up sexually.<br>  <br>  When you do have oral sex ask if the person has done it before and ask if they have any sexually transmitted diseases as you don't and you don't want to get any.

Are you feeling that you have both changed since when you fell in love with each other? Are you just stressed at getting married? Are you worried  you won't get along?

y9icmRcYaa	Don't take this the wrong way but, you shouldn't keep your hopes up. I'm sure he will text again but, he seems like he doesn't have the time for anything serious. There may be another girl in the picture. Whatever it is, try to focus on other things and don't wait to hear from him. If you keep checking your texts hoping he will get back to you, it will drive you crazy. <br>  <br>  PS texts are great for casual day to day conversation but, maybe you should give him a call and leave a message for him. That way he can't say he didn't get your text (guys love that excuse) and if he doesn't respond after a phone call, it's probably time to lose his number.|`|j7fzuDxgaa	i maybe very wrong but i would hope that if someone really liked me they would make an effort to contact me. and just a call or a text would take 2 Min's of his life i don't think that's much to ask for. but that's me i could be wrong. he may be shy, may not know if you like him etc. good luck|`|EHujGe5Oaa	Dont worry, give it time|`|SLTlvqRlaa	LOL He said to you he was a footballer... gullible.... what team?|`|FzFSzilmaa	maybe he thought he DID return your text... or got disturbed...<br>  <br>  text him again... if you don't get a response this time, take that as a hint that he ain't interested..

KKrRmHqqaa	Hi. My advice is don't ever do anything you don't feel ready to do. From what you wrote it sounds like you've already thought about this decision a lot though, and it doesn't sound like your planning on "losing it" just to fit in. Good for you! <br>  As for being dissapointed if you wait until marriage - no offense to your family - but I think that is a pretty much a load of crap. Yes of course, if your expecting your first time to be absolutely amazing and perfect you will be dissapointed. Truth is you probably won't be super good at sex - or anything else - the first time. Like everything else it takes practice.<br>  However, assuming you wait your first time will be extremely special. It may not be the best sex you ever have with you wife, but sharing your first time with someone is such a memorable, emotional experience, and such a great gift to give your future wife.<br>  You will not be bitter for waiting, and you would not be waiting "for nothing". You would be waiting in order to save your body for your future wife, and that is very admirable. <br>  At least that is my 2cents! <br>  I wish you all the luck in the world with your decision, and hope this helped if only a little.|`|lhhQLc79aa	ahm.. do what you think is right. besides you're of legal age. you can decide for yourself. you can listen and thank your family for their insights for you but in the end, its only you who should decide for yourself. if you want to wait, then follow your heart and mind. its only you who have total control of yourself. :)|`|1UEhc6n7aa	Ok, I'm thinking I should just tell you to do what you want to do. But if you want my real opinion, I don't really understand why people wait until marriage. Yes, do it with someone you're serious about, but think about it. Your wedding night... You have been with this woman for ages, possibly years without doing anything. Awkward already. If she has been with you for years, then she may be a virgin as well... Pain on her part... Your wedding night is supposed to be fun. Not painful and awkward. And you will have that memory for the rest of your life. I'm not saying go out and be promiscuous and have sex with every girl you see, but if it was me, I definately wouldn't want to wait for my wedding night. <br>  Good luck :)|`|JzyhBtokaa	I've honestly never heard of a family who tells you NOT to wait for marriage.  You're only setting yourself up for disappointment if you make a decision based on what other people tell you instead of what YOU want!  It's great that you're actually putting thought into something like this (most people don't) but you shouldn't let it worry you so much.  Just do what feels right to you...and don't disclose the details of your sex life to your family---that's kind of weird, and they shouldn't be pressing you for details!  XP|`|17e9c7e9b8c52f6480ee24e65f4d402eaa	if YOU believe in it.<br>  <br>  personally I dont . <br>  i dont understand (i mean i do) but like I dont see why people are saving themselves for someone else, that they dont even know yet.<br>  its like leaving food out for some homeless person. sure its nice, but whats the point of doing it if you dont even know who that person will be. I mean i guess its different cause its like "nice" to wait .<br>  but I dont see a point.<br>  i guess its because I wasnt raised with any religion<br>  <br>  if youre very religious and have strong values and believe in that then do it. if youre doing it for the sake of your religion and what youre 'supposed' to do then dont. it should be up to you.|`|ybexjS2Paa	I really admire people like you, but think about it. What if the guy you'll marry turns up to be really bad in bed? Can you cope with it? I'd say try before the marriage with guy you are in a serious relationship of course. You can always work things out. It's better than getting disappointed on your wedding night.
SL1bsp4zaa	He never ever calls?? unless to make plans? how often does he make plans with you? What kind of things do you do together? does he tell you he cares about you still? does he look you in the eyes when he says it? I hate to say it, but that doesn't seem too good if he is never calling you ... unless you guys often make plans... Maybe try to give it a little distance and don't call him at all for a while and see if he calls... if he doesn't get out quick girl-- he's just not that into you-- as hard as it is to accept, it's the truth. Don't buy into his lies.. If he's into you, he'll call you after some time if you don't call him.. If he cares, he'll call-- it's as simple as that. Good luck|`|msoDXmvuaa	hahahaha hes cheap ..u know he is too

I guess your girlfriend has low self esteem issues I reckon, which is probably very hard for her. I assume she has been let down in the past by a guy or is afraid you'll leave her for someone who has a completely stretch-mark free body or something. You just have to be there for her, show her you care about her and earn her complete trust - once you have accomplished these things she will have total faith in you and herself. I think the real issue is she herself has to think better of herself. I think you should do something really sweet like for her bday or a general present, get a really nice fancy box or something and put lots of little notes inside with all the things you love about her. Put a picture of both of you on the front and write something sweet like "... (name) love you forever.

YvvwMxE4aa	Well I am an indian guy and basically..if your living in India then i know its much more harder than it is living in england. i think you should refuse to get married if you are not ready for and don't listen to your parents discouraging and insulting you. We are all beautiful in the eyes of our creator, even supermodels and actress's such as Karena Kapoor et al have their faults. You should be confident in your ability, if there is a will then there is a way trust me on that. there is nothing impossible if you just set your mind on it. As for your mum not following doctors advice well it doesn't surprise me. a lot of our indian people don't follow doctors advice instead they follow advice from local amateur gurus and priest. Just look out for opportunities and just go for the one your heart tells you. Whatever you do don't be pressured into getting married and doing things you don't want to because you will end up regretting it all your life like some people i know. I hope that has been helpful.|`|JBd3QeMNaa	First stand up for yourself. why do your parents need to find you a husband? he may be violent! if you want a job you'll have to go get one. call up your last position and ak if they are hiring. then go on the internet nd see what other places are open.

They want us to share our emotions.  That is, all emotions except "anger".  That emotion, we are supposed to repress.  <br>  If we raise our voice, we are being "verbally abusive".  If we try to cool down before talking, we are being "distant" or as you put it, we are hiding from confrontation.<br>  Your best strategy is to tell the man, "I would like to talk about this before the end of the day tomorrow.  Let me know when are are ready to discuss it."  This gives him time to cool down.  It lets him know something is bothering you, and it gives him control about when the conversation takes place, so that he doesn't feel cornered into having a conversation when he is not emotionally ready to have that conversation yet.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...lack of confidence, irresponsible and low self esteem...|`|G50ucmllaa	I suggest you read Men are From Mars, Women are From Venus.|`|1168bcccfff6f3a578ef3a0223e4cce5aa	This is a remarkably good question if you can read between the lines on the way it is presented!<br>  <br>  Firstly I am going to make the distinction between being caught doing something that hurts you and anger. These two things illicit different emotions from the male - someone caught doing something is going to feel guilty/embarassed (they know they have done something wrong) in this situation why argue? You know it was wrong and 'take it like a man' as the old phrase goes. The angry woman is likely to illicit an angry response from her partner. <br>  You need to understand the expression of emotion in a male is seen as a negative thing, a weakness. We are told to suppress our emotions from an early age with things like 'boys don't cry' etc. being common sayings (even in our schools); the result of this is two fold - it teaches men how to control them in certain situations where a woman would, typically, not; and where emotions do bubble through to the surface we have difficulty expressing that - this is a MAJOR reason for males being more aggressive/violent - and it may manifest in a physical altercation.<br>  We are also taught that one of the lowest things you can do as a man is hit a woman, so when things start getting out of control we take ourselves out of the situation, not for our good but for your safety!<br>  As for the going to bed angry thing - where arguments do occur most men will tell you; bed is the last place you're allowed. If you're lucky you might get a blanket and a pillow hurled at you down the stairs!!<br>  I have to say that in my experience this idea of women in general going to bed calm after an argument is a fallacy, I have no argument with you personally doing it (I don't know you so accept what you say at face value) but of the considerable number of men I know and have worked with the over whelming majority end up 'in the dog house' for weeks at a time and my wife does the whole reorganising the house thing if we have a disagreement (I'm sure it's just so it can be my fault for things going back in the wrong place, and draw it out).|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Why do men run and hide from confrontation?<br>  <br>  If you find a man that is running & hiding from confrontation I'll show you a woman that is over-sensitive & constantly badgers the guy over insignificant affronts to her sensibilities or a woman that will belabor the issue (even after an apology has been given).  In cases like those, guys will opt to hide / run than deal with it because after awhile it gets old.  People make mistakes..get over it (we do).|`|WbVE1cXKaa	I cannot speak for everyone.<br>  <br>  For me, if I do not walk away for a couple minutes to cool down, and let my mind return to control over my anger, it is much more likely that I will do or say something that everyone will regret later.<br>  <br>  If you keep poking at that sore spot, it is certain that I will lash out to get you to stop.  If I know you that well, I know EXACTLY what to say to hurt you back, and I would prefer not to do that, so stop picking on the metaphorical scab until I can talk to you calmly and not expand the argument beyond the immediate issue.<br>  <br>  The inability of my ex-wife to recognize this need is the principal cause for the divorce.|`|nX1QW5GCaa	Nothing to do with men ony.

Avoid talking about something is like running out of that situtaion and this is not a solution of problem... mens are somewhat high temper, they loose their temper when they find something wrong or get hurted, so get them cool then run away and getting cool they think about the situation.

sbeoF50gaa	Ok I only read the first part and skimmed through the rest. I don't need to read all of it to tell you what I'm going to say. He's controlling, he's insecure, and he's abusive. This abuse is bad after ONLY 6 months. Lets add a year to that and now he's shoving you and punching holes in the wall or worse, in you. He can get help... but he probably won't These are red flags for an abusive relationship. He will say sorry and then he will do it again. I used to volunteer at the Womens Shelter here and what you are describing is identical to what I've heard a million times. You can not let a man control your life this way. You are a human being with interested and needs all of your own. It will only get worse as time passes. Please get out while you can and don't stand for this abuse. Right now he's mentally, verbally, and emotionally abusing you. This is not ok! If he agrees to get help and stick with it then he CAN change... but he has to see what he's doing as wrong, and want to change.|`|kprKXEOSaa	You're in an abusive relationship.

He is controlling and every bit of your letter is proof of domestic abuse. Get out now. But be careful because he is the type who would come back and hurt you, saying "If I can't have you, then no one will!" <br>  His behavior goes way beyond mere jealousy, he wants to control every minute of your life because he is insecure, controlling, and because he can. Love has nothing to do with this relationship. Someone who loves you would never do these things to you! Do not remain in this relationship, get out and get a restraining order against him. <br>  He cannot see the truth because he is wrapped up in his own warped sense of love and duty.<br>  I cannot stress it enough, you have got to leave, you may very well be saving your own life.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	this man is abusive and dangerous you need to stay the hell away from him I believe he is mentally abusing and is physically abusing you this is not normal but controlling no guy should tell you what to do why are you still with him this is not love please contact the women's battered shelter they will talk to you counsel you and get you away from t his dangerous man these type of men kill their wives and girlfriends or beat them to death I have seen this get some help and stay away from him once he figures out he cant control  you he will become really dangerous and go after your family|`|r2gonS44aa	You had better be joking.<br>  <br>  NO SELF RESPECTING WOMEN would put up with crap like this.<br>  <br>  Leave the b as$ tard.<br>  <br>  NOW.<br>  <br>  It will be hard to leave him, because you will be so used to him.

He is disrespecting you, and he is seriously not in a good position mentally.<br>  <br>  He is one of those people, that no matter how you try, you won't be able to convince him that you are not cheating. No matter if you spend every waking moment with him. He will think that you are calling your boyfriend when you go to the bathroom, and soon you will have to pee with the door open.<br>  <br>  It only gets worse babe.  NEVER better.

And second, I would have 911 handy at all times.<br>  <br>  A man who really cares for you does not look in YOUR phone and try to force you to have a family with him.

(based on what i've read.) whether he may know it or not. i just got out of an abusive relationship. i waited too long though to leave him...please listen to me. there are different types of abusers, and i have read a couple of books about them and there was A LOT of stuff that started to make sense, as to why he was doing the things he was doing. please make sure you delete your history on your computer so he won't be able to check and see where you have been on the computer. he's already checking to see if you called any other men besides him. he's the type, based on what i've read, to eventually get physically abusive. it may not seem like it now, but trust me, it will happen.  i know it's hard if you try and leave him b/c you love him so much, but please...heed my warning...it'll only get worse. plus he's already trying to control and isolate you. it's a common tactic among abusers....they do it so you would feel alone, and like you CAN'T escape. like you have no where to go. but you do. please be smarter than i was.....there's a place i know of if you have no where to stay/go. it's called w.r.c. (women's resource center) it's for women who have no where to go, have drug problems, or who have been battered (abused) and for women who are trying to escape an abusive relationship...or all of the above. here's the number: 570-346-4671...please don't wait until it gets worse...a lot of women die each year b/c of the hands of an abuser....hard to believe but it's true....and as far as him saying it's b/c he loves you so much...if he knows what he is doing, and knows that he's abusive, then he's trying to make you believe that. But if he doesn't know that he's being abusive, then he's saying it to try and convince himself that, that is the reason/or both/or b/c he really believes it. if he loved you, he wouldn't be doing these things to try and control and isolate and manipulate you to his liking. he's gonna try and break you down so he wouldn't have to worry/feel insecure about you "cheating" on him. trust me....please...do not hesitate...i did...and paid GREATLY for it....please. get out while you still can....there IS help if you feel like you can't do it alone. no one expects you to do it on your own. i know it's hard and that you want to help him....but you can't....i learned that the hard way...i had to get a pfa on my ex b/c he wouldn't leave me alone. the wrc is a safe place for you to stay/go until you get back on your feet.. i've been there a couple of times. and got back on my feet each time. it wasn't easy, let me tell you...but it was WORTH it. hope i helped. GOOD LUCK.

A Great Way To Solve The Problem Is To Have A Break From The Break Up. Spend Some Time With Friends And Socialising.

The First Is To Control Your Emotions. You Can't Talk To Someone If Your Emotions Are All Over The Place. Secondly, Text Her, But No More Than 3 Times A Day. This Shows That You Are Still Interested But Are Willing To Give Her Space. Thirdly, Clear Your Mind And Reflect On The Cause Of The Breakup. Fourthly, Do Not Come Across As Desperate Or Needy. And Finally, Relearn To Be Yourself. Think Of All The Things She Fell In Love With And Enhance Those Things.

kprKXEOSaa	You guys have a lot going on here.  You probably need counseling, and you probably need to figure out ways to simplify your lives a bit.  He's too stressed and tired.<br>  In general, men don't need a talking to.  How do you approach your husband about your sex life?  Just go to bed naked and snuggle up to him.  If all he wants to do is cuddle, that's ok.  Do it again the next night.  I personally wouldn't think there would be anything wrong with your asking him to give you an orgasm without intercourse, if he doesn't feel up to "performing."  He might change his mind after a few minutes.<br>  The way you're handling things may be giving him performance anxiety.  Let him take the lead a little more.  And you may need to review how you're making him feel "manly" outside of the bedroom and with your child.  Does he know that you're attracted to him, not just his body, but him?  Does he know you think he's a great dad?  Does he know that you admire and respect him?  Do you admire and respect him?|`|5FVyVS9vaa	You guys need a date with each other.

She may be worried that if you meet in person there won't be any chemistry, and then the whole relationship will be over.  She may be happier to continue for now with the cyber relationship rather than chance losing all of it.  Have you shared pictures?  She may be insecure about her appearance, or may worry that you won't find her attractive.

Then you can know whether or not he is worthwhile.<br>  <br>  Most of the time, I just casually enjoy the attention that it brings.<br>  <br>  ... I don't like meeting in person unless it's sort of a group thing, because otherwise there may not be an escape route if things start to hit the fan. A lot of the time, you can get along great with someone over the phone or in text message, but in person they just send mixed signals... could be awkward.<br>  <br>  She very well could have a boyfriend. Maybe you just listen to her more than he does, and she can confide in you over the phone. Maybe if you seen pictures of her and whatnot-- maybe they are really good angled shots, or maybe they are not even her. She might have somethin' she's not telling you about, you know?<br>  <br>  The stalker thing has always been a huge thing. If there is a significant age gap, that is probably an issue. Someone who could have had a potential predator in the past might not be able to get past that.<br>  <br>  But most of all, if she is generally just avoiding answering about going out, she most likely isn't interested in taking the next step. Perhaps you should just tell her that you're really into her-- and suggest that she gives you her point of view on it. If she wants to change the topic, she's trying to keep the friendship you have without making it awkward. But please, please remember that all people LOVE attention. Don't let her play games with your emotions, it's not fair for her to waste your time.

You HAVE to be better than this!|`|Rgj6kTOwaa	in all honesty i think your partner needs to grow some balls and tell her where to effin go!! he has rights to see his children regardless of whether he is still sleeping with there mum or not!! to be honest his sob story sounds a bit like bullshitting, he is having his cake and eating it!! he might be sorry and im sure he is, but if he is bothered about hurting his children then he should stop this bollocks go to court and win custody fair and square! you say she is demanding ridiculous amounts of money so im sure he can afford the court bill! she says sh doesnt care about hurting her child but neither does he if this is how he goes about seeing them! imagine how his child feels when he sees his mum and dad together and then dad goes home to his girlfiend and he does the same to you what he did to the mum!!! its just all wrong!! sort it out properly with legal advice and his mum wont have a leg to stand on!! dont be a push over!!|`|0KgoHS3Caa	ok....i hate to say this coz it aint gona be what u want too here...but it sounds like they are taking you for a ride here hun.....

He has to choose between your relationship and the other side. There are no half measures with mad women like his ex's sort, and these things never stop by themselves. The only one who could make her understand that it's really over is him, and in doing so he must make it clear to her that HE DOESN'T CARE what consequences it would bring along (i.e. not seeing his kid). A mad woman makes a man weak and you need a strong man to be able to raise your own child with him. Think about the fact that you are going to have a kid and this situation cannot last for too long, else it will affect the innocent creature as well.
679a9612ab8ce1cdc2658471a9a16fcbaa	Although it was a bad thing that you did by sleeping with your ex boyfriend, it was a mistake that made you realise just how much you love your current boyfriend. <br>  <br>  The fact that you are both still together says that your relationship is strong. If he forgave you and you are both happy now, then put it behind you and move forward. The day you told him is the day you started afresh with your boyfriend. Wipe out what happened before that and focus on your relationship. You can't change what has happened in the past, no matter how much you want to.<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend obviously loves you, if he has put it behind him then so should you. Also, I would avoid seeing this ex boyfriend to avoid temptation.<br>  <br>  Best wishes and good luck for the future|`|orae36Rhaa	LEARN from this experience ! <br>  Get checked for std , you don't want to have to feel guilty about infecting your bf on top of cheating on him!<br>   perhaps it is a good thing you are having a difficult time forgiving yourself, it shows that you have some moral standards. <br>  It's done ,it is forgiven ....let it go , don't dwell on it !|`|rJxpXs35aa	your lucky he didn't kill you or something.you know how you are weak and a cheater and if you did it once you'll do it again.you should feel terrible and never forget that cause thats the only thing that might stop you from doing it again|`|NxZl1Qccaa	i think you should,your bf has forgiven you, and you are happy so stop and move on,enjoy your relationship,|`|WosBbcViaa	past is past girl...<br>  think before u leap or else just continue life .......<br>  just try to share thoughts it might help.....|`|ddMlbXdAaa	Well if he has forgiven you then move on but what you did was wrongggggggg|`|eqCI4M9Yaa	well if your current boyfriend can get over it you should be able to|`|SQe4ghfdaa	If your boyfriend has forgiven you, then let that be that.

Please help me."<br>  <br>  You aren't weak. I used to cheat on boyfriend after boyfriend with one ex, who wasn't really about anything. Now me and my ex I slept with don't talk anymore. Simply because he didn't have a life and he was a cheater. Now I'm with a new boyfriend (for a second time) and we're so happy. I don't think about my ex. Don't think about your ex.

Do not even be friends with this guy - for he was just as wrong as you were - and he knew you were with another guy. <br>  If you really value your relation you have now - cut the ex out of your life totally and completely - if not for yourself, then because you love your boyfriend. <br>  <br>  This because, if he is still part of your life in any way, your current boyfriend could get suspicious or could have trust issues.<br>  <br>  Learn from what happened, but indeed, stop torturing yourself and move on to the present.|`|rvSrjNeQaa	?? ..................??|`|mVUpt8waaa	The only person whos opinion matters is your boyfriend.

X4hz3a9haa	The simple fact is that your ex can apply to the court to be allowed to take the children abroad, and there’s a fair chance that she’ll be granted permission by the court. You’d be well advised to talk to your solicitor first to assess your full legal options. If it does come to court, you’ll need to mount good objections to your ex taking the kids abroad to live. Much of that strategy would be on how it affects the kids themselves, since that should be the focus for the court. It’s one that might serve you well, since the court could be encouraged to take testimony from the children themselves. <br>  <br>  <br>  That’s not good news overall, and certainly not reassuring news, unfortunately. That also makes it a good idea to try and work something out with your ex if that’s at all possible. Otherwise there’s going to be even more animosity than there is now, which makes things worse for the children, too. <br>  <br>  <br>  Keep your tempers in control where you talk to your ex, and keep the focus on the children and what’s best for them. Divorce can be traumatic enough for them, although you’ve all apparently coped with it quite well to date. Keep them at the centre of things, always.|`|AA10481071	not allowed without your permission,  if you were in America|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Listen to your legal advice, solicitors, etc.  Yes, it IS "just their job".

eVK2zZsOaa	You shouldn't do that to her. Why don't you just break up with and spare her having to hear you tell her to lose weight. Women have enough pressure on them as it is to look a certain way and for somebody to have to hear their boyfriend tell them to lose weight and wear makeup would only make her feel bad. If you want her to lose weight for health reasons then that is fine, but if you want her to lose weight for your own selfish reasons...then break up with her and find somebody more to your  liking. As far as the makeup is concerned...she might not like to wear make up. Make up doesn't make a person look attractive, in fact most women wear make to hide imperfections. You probably knew that she was overweight and didn't wear make up when you met her so either love her for who she is or leave her alone.|`|I40iBJdHaa	wow. she can do so much better than you, not the other way around. i hope she dumps your lame ***|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	Wow I think that if you do not find your girlfriend hot you should not be with her!

First of all if you love her, you shouldn't try to change her... but if you feel that way you can't help it. Ask her why she doesn't wear makeup. After she tells you her reasons just say that you think that girls look pretty with makeup and that you really like it. If she is as smart as you say she is, she will get the hint. Same thing with the weight. Don't just say "hey babe, I think you are fat"... but concentrate on the positiveness of the criticism; "You would look great with 15 less pounds."... If nothing works then tell her how you feel the nicest way possible.|`|jmyCfIO5aa	That makeup wearing, anorexic, pole dancer is going to treat you just like you are treating this girl.<br>  Look beneath the hot-tie factor, because what’s there is what you will have when the looks are gone.<br>  As men we are very visual, and  sadly, we make some pretty bad choices based on this.<br>   Do you really think that little hot-tie you want is going to stick around? <br>  She will be looking at every Potential  hot-tie her self.<br>   Find you a good woman, based on looks, smarts, family values and most of all a good Sense of humor.<br>  For this woman’s sake, let her go so she can find a nice guy that will love what’s beneath the makeup!<br>  Go to the ATM get you a fist full of singles and  head out to the local strip club. <br>  The love of your life is there waiting for you!
HMteUyRdaa	Mike this woman doesn't sound like a Catholic, she sounds like a nut case. Good luck, I have no advice to give you accept wow I am sorry. <br>  <br>  Too bad she is a nutcase, my cousin dated a woman whose mother was pretty nutty too. He is protestant, she was Catholic and it didn't turn out well, sadly he really loved the girl too.<br>  <br>  Oh well can't win em all. But since your wife is Catholic you know that this is not the general attitude with in the Catholic Community. There are bad seeds everywhere. I am very religious and as you see above  I think this woman is crazy.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Kate<br>  <br>  PS<br>  Misty is right, Catholic's believe we are a continuation of the Jewish faith (at least most of us do). I have more Jewish friends then Christian friends.|`|aEpPt9koaa	I agree with your wife, its not the girls fault, its her mother that is putting these things in her head and if she doesn't have anyone else in her small town to show her differently then her mother's word is the only one she has to go on. And don't ignore the girl when she comes over. That's rude and not even neccessary. If anything use it as a chance to educate her on religion and how your family practices it so that way maybe there won't be anymore major misunderstandings on religion again.|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	You know what your wife is wrong, But the good news is she will grow weary of the impending out burst by this child's mother as long as this girlfriend is involved with your son.  And next time she needs a ride let your wife go get her! I wouldn't ignore the child and only because of the effect it would have on your son and the chain effect it would have all the way up to the mother and back to your wife, but that doesn't mean you have to go out of YOUR way for this girl.  And the reason I say this is because it sounds like she might have instigated the blow up. My mother was, is mentally unstable and there some things I won't even discuss with her due to her unhealthy mental state which I was quite aware of as a young adult.  I think this young girl will not be able to differentiate from health and unhealthy. So I would be reserved until she proves otherwise! Feeling sorry for her won't help her.<br>  <br>  And your right religion does separate!  But when your manipulated as religion does on an unhealthy world, we will all ways have to deal with ignorance.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Sounds as though this woman (mother) needs to grow up and have an open mind. However, this is probably not going to happen, she is who she is and you say she controls every aspect of her daughters life. Well, seems the only thing you can do is simply be quiet and try to have as little contact with her as possible. She will die with her prejudicial ideology and misconceptions of others. So sad for her. Don't be angry with this young lady, she is only living from what she knows, what she has been taught. As we all do. And it appears she has been raised with a shallow and very closed minded mother. Hopefully, the more time she spends with your family this will open up the doors for communication and she will gain a new perspective of life from different angles. Not just her mothers. Good luck.|`|haCssg2Laa	wow, i feel for you in this situation<br>  fanatics of any sorts are a problem and it sounds like the girls mother is brainwashing her, and it sounds like she doesnt want her to leave her so she is kinda putting the frighteners on here Re;the big bad world out there<br>  unless the girl breaks free and expereinces things for herself she will never know any different and live in her mothers shadow forever, sad, but not uncommon<br>  <br>  its not the girls fault but she has had a taster and instead of being her own person and telling her mother she wants more, she is hiding behind her apron strings so doing herself no favours at all<br>  if i were you, i would sit back and wait<br>  see what happens<br>  if you get the chance welcome her again as you have<br>  if not, leave well alone, <br>  your family sounds like one she should be proud to be part of<br>  her loss i'm afraid|`|wxBFZ41Taa	I think your wife is right. The girl is young and her mother's influence is most of what she's known. You can talk to her about it, and see how she feels about it...she is not her mother. <br>  <br>  As a devout Catholic, I have to say this woman's behavior is not that of a devout Catholic. We do not shun Jewish tradition or holidays, we see the Jewish faith as part of our own. This woman may say she's Catholic, but she sounds more like she's prejudice to me...and that has no religious foundation. <br>  <br>  Give the girl a chance. Show her that other people of different faiths are not like her mother. Show her that you are welcoming, loving and open to her beliefs and that you expect that same treatment from others. Maybe she will learn something.|`|lqt3wTQvaa	some people are just crazy..this lady sounds like she's a couple martini's short of a round...encourage your son to move on as it's only going to be like pulling teeth from here on out
g3l5f9iwaa	If you feel comfortable and it really is a concern of yours, you could tell him how you feel about the situation. But, these situations get tricky because if there are any bad feelings on either side, you probably don't want to get stuck in the middle. The other thing is that you don't want to say anything that will implicate any of the other kids, or say something that they wouldn't want you to. That would put you in a bad position. I wonder if the other kids would want to share their concerns and feelings directly with him, and you could join them if you wanted, they wanted, and you were all comfortable. Otherwise, you are just the lucky benefactor of this behavior. I could see where you would feel uncomfortable because of the way the other kids feel. But, you may want to consider all ramifications and repercussions before you make any decisions on how to handle this. <br>  There was no favoritism in my family, but I think it probabloy happens a lot. Good luck.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I think its more unfair then normal. This happens in many families, mine included. I think the best thing you can do is remind your father that your other siblings need his attention too. My guess is that he most likely knows this anyway.
pGIOz14Faa	The first thing your mom needs to figure out for herself is which is more important...her freedom and peace of mind or the house.  Until she makes the move to end the relationship nothing is going to happen with that house.  He is controlling the situation and your mom by doing the one thing he knows she can't tolerate.  By begging her back when she left and then continuing his behavior he proved he is only manipulating her.  When she stops playing the game by his rules, things will change.  She needs to move out, not tell him where she is, contact a lawyer and explain what she wants out of the deal, and be in NO contact with the man until things are resolved.  Tell her to take herself out of a position of weakness.|`|1hciyvKdaa	She really cant. You go file, he gets served while sittng at home, he gets upset, and its a stand off. She could try pakcing up every single item he owns, throw in a few dishes plates a pan, a towel etc, place it outside, then have him served at work. Change the locks on the door. You can call the PD and ask if they are ok with doing this, this way and if he calls them to get in, would they respond and force you two to let him in. This is how my marriage ended, and my ex left with no issues when he was handed those papers. I dont know what the cops would of done had he called. Hes got enough women out there to go stay with. Id try this, if he gets violent, like really violent, call the cops.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	she needs to contact a lawyer. if he is cheating, she can get a lot out of a divorce and the house could definately be one of them.|`|tvK1xjzkaa	Well it sounds like the years of neglect may have done a toll on her self-esteem. I would have her contact a support group first to find out how she needs to help her self first. Then she needs to have a lot of support from family and friends to make it through. Your poor mother. Contact a divorce attorney and he will take her through the steps to finalize the divorce.|`|S5x6KNHraa	if she can prove that he is cheating that is grounds
5vgnrvcmaa	One or all of your daughters may want to wear it. If it's not in the way, keep it for them.<br>  <br>  My mom thought she couldn't have any children, but kept her dress anyway. 15 years after they were married, I came along. Even if I don't get married, I may want to cut it down, dye it and wear it to my prom.<br>  <br>  Keep the dress.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Well what do you do with your wedding dress? PERIOD. <br>  <br>  I am on my first marriage and don't quite plan on going for round 2 if things were to fail in round 1. But still, I have my dress and don't know what to do with it. <br>  <br>  You could always donate it to goodwill ??|`|SBBnWsJJaa	Ask your daughter - maybe she would like to have it for her wedding (assuming that the dress is from your and her father's wedding).|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Send it to your ex to store for his next marriage.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I got married naked so none of this would happen. donate it to charity someone can use it.|`|1k7LIZVWaa	I gave mine to Goodwill.  It made me feel better...|`|SfGyzMSFaa	If the dress is clean and in good shape (no tears, no stains), then you could find a consignment shop in your area that handles wedding attire. My youngest daughter and I shopped at a local consignment shop that carries wedding dresses last year in preparation for her wedding. <br>  <br>  You could use e-bay or Craigslist to sell the dress. Personally, I prefer the consignment shop, because you don't get the calls and emails at your home.<br>  <br>  You could donate the dress to a local charity.|`|eVK2zZsOaa	You can find a store that probably takes used dresses like that and hand it over. I am sure there is someplace out there that will take it because there are plenty of women would be willing to pay for a used dressed....well depending on what it looks like. If not and you don't care about it anymore, just throw it away. If it is bothering you that bad, you won't miss it but I would try to find a store that takes used dresses(if there is such a store out there).|`|hYZIYla0aa	Sell it,Burn it,I would get rid of it one way or another,Some people believe it is bad luck to pass the dress on to your daughter if it was part of a marriage that did not work.In the end it is your choice.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	Take it to a charity shop now.  Your husband says it doesn't bother him, but of course it does really.  Why on earth have you hung onto it for so long?|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Sell it or have something made out of it.  Most people have christening gowns made from theirs...maybe there's another alternative?|`|dprURFLxaa	I burned mine in a celebration bonfire.|`|0UUDFxR0aa	I would save it for my daughter.|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	sell it on craigslist!|`|V1GKJh8zaa	If your daughter wants it, keep it for her. Saves you $ for her wedding. If she's not interested, there are charities you can donate it to - or sell it and put the money in savings, into your daughter's future or?<br>  <br>  Men usually say exactly what they think. You might want to check out Men are like Waffles, Women are like Spaghetti. :D<br>  <br>  Best of luck - don't let fabric ruin your confidence and the peace in your home.|`|qKGbvKe6aa	well really leave the past in the past but since you have your daughter to wear it i assume, ask her if she will even wear it and if yes, storage.|`|DlsIa3azaa	I threw mine out in the dumpster last weekend :). I had it for 12 years and it was a size 2. I was sick of being reminded how thin I once was and I'm divorced. Pitch dress!|`|diggYEPlaa	You could sell it or give it to someone who needs a wedding dress.|`|YpHDtICtaa	sell it on ebay!! people are always looking for nice dresses and especially because we're in a recession! if its in mint condition itl be nabbed up straight away!! gud luck :D|`|kK4vYqXPaa	Keep it for your daughter

d7bJIgqlaa	Yes, you would be related.  If you have cousins it will be easier to think of it like this....<br>  <br>  There is you and your cousin George.  :)<br>  You grow up and you have a daughter and you name her Kate.  Then your daughter has a daughter and names her Lilly.  <br>  <br>  Geroge has a son and names him Joe.  Then Joe has a son and names him Tommy.<br>  <br>  Lilly and Tommy are friends, but they are also distant cousins...and that is you. :)|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	Yes, but it's distant.<br>  <br>  Basically, your grandfather and his grandfather shared a grandparent.  This means that you are third cousins.  Third cousins are considered to be a very distant relation.  Thus, for example, third cousins are legally allowed to marry in every state.<br>  <br>  By the way, the way it works is:<br>  <br>  Share a parent, you're a sibling.<br>  Share a grandparent, you're a first cousin.<br>  Share a great-grandparent, you're a second cousin.<br>  Share a great-great grandparent, you're third cousins.<br>  <br>  Etc.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	Yes, you are cousins, 3rd or fourth. Your blood relatives share blood. That makes you related.|`|WFRooU7Maa	Not in most southern states<br>  <br>  But yeah a little|`|ueWVf6Y1aa	Yes, distantly, but there isn't a specific name for this relation.|`|CnTKZns1aa	Yes but very distantly|`|djUMvICoaa	You should be third cousins.   grandfathers 1st.<br>                                              parents         2nd and his<br>                                              you               3rd. and him|`|yNz4p3B4aa	yes...u are cuzions|`|z1C75GIaaa	It's more like distant cousins.|`|20iKbSTFaa	yes, but you would be distance cousins
6zgwIEP3aa	I think he has psychological issues for real. Spanking could be related to something in his past.. abused/ sexually abused by one of his parents, relatives or even kids at school maybe?<br>  <br>  I think you should tell a counselor about this experience. Do not ignore such a sign, it might get serious in the future. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|c5UAa65qaa	Frankly, it sounds like he's the one being controlling.  You're not going to resolve your communication issues if he has the unilateral ability to end the argument at any time by spanking you.  And if it is a turn-on for him, then you still need the reassurance that there's something you can do to stop it (like use a safeword) if you're seriously uncomfortable.  Let him know that you'd like to talk about this a bit more before it becomes household policy, and if he doesn't want to listen to you, strongly consider counseling.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	No that is not normal, but if you use if for fore play do it more often and you should all get along fine.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Seriously, tell him if he ever tries this again you will call the police and have him put in jail for domestic assault.  Then do it.  (do it NOW if you fear him)<br>  <br>  Some weirdos think "domestic discipline" is how husbands are supposed to love their wives--can't do it in the US.|`|1k7LIZVWaa	Oh yeah, he was totally getting off on it.  He wanted to quit arguing and get busy on the make up sex.|`|7sEFufRbaa	Sounds fun.|`|TEX1iYQgaa	This isn't normal at all.<br>  <br>  Intelligent people seek counsel and find ways to improve their communication ~ they don't spank their spouses like they're children.<br>  <br>  What will your husband do when he sees that spanking isn't producing the results he wants to see? Punch you, push you around, throw you down the stairs?<br>  <br>  You're husband is not your dad, you're not his child ~ you're his wife. You are to be his equal. It sounds like he can't handle that, and so he's resorting to physical force in order to keep you in your place ~ whatever he decides that should be.<br>  <br>  Make an appointment for some marriage counseling. This spanking business has to stop. Effective communication skills have to be learned, and they will need to be taught to both you and your husband.|`|BL4PEjAWaa	spanking outside the bedroom is never a good idea, but I think he may be trying to see if the arguments are being caused by him not being  dominate enough.  I would talk to him about getting bad advise from someone.  <br>    If he did not leave marks as in a "real" spanking he may have been trying to turn the argument to a sexual scene.<br>    I would have a long talk with about when and where spanking is permitted.<br>    Good Luck and remember you are newly weds, there is sexual Communication and verbal cummunication you need to work on both.|`|7bba2cecc3b8d0c8d7e003ceea9f79e2aa	uh? ha ha. No but seriously, you need to confront him over this before this gets out of control. I think there are two possibilities:<br>  <br>  1.) He gets turned on on when you are acting like this <br>  or 2.) Maybe he is trying to be a male chauvinists and prove that he is the one in control<br>  <br>  Either way, just ask him.|`|rEo5gfO3aa	It really depends on the tone in which it happened. Did you feel like a punished child, or did it feel like a light hearted sex thing? If he was serious, then you need to cut that off right away.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	He is probably just doing it jokingly. Don't take it personal.|`|kyUiaDgyaa	Probably a "Turn-on" for him|`|QJslTCUBaa	Now, Lucy calm down. You know how much Ricky likes to do the spanking.|`|FzFSzilmaa	next time make sure you are naked when it happens... and tell him you need to the rest of the foreplay... :D|`|0ksJVQ04aa	Is it normal?  It is unusual and some people would call it abnormal.  But I don't think it is perverted.  It is a very old fashioned way to resolve conflicts between husband and wife.  Are you a controlling person?  Do you want to be a controlling wife?  If you want a more traditional marriage and are willing to be submissive to your husband, and if he spanks you carefully to avoid any permanent damage, you might find this to be a good way to improve your new marriage.|`|q7KL0wuuaa	Well if he is not just playing around then something is seriously wrong?? I totally understand using it in the bedroom at times, but when it come to your actual everyday life no that's not normal. You need to sit down and talk to him about why he thinks its ok to spank you if you act a certain way? He is your husband not your dad and You are an adult anyways?|`|hYZIYla0aa	Sounds sexual to me,maybe he is role playing? I have no other reasons why this happened?|`|CQsD09D6aa	I honestly have solution for your problem. Maybe next time you should refuse to bend over. Maybe you enjoyed it?|`|kpXRhoTvaa	lol sounds like a fetish|`|pvZZ9Jzmaa	maybe its a turn on for him?????|`|9ee9c3634dd96d7e269a10b75b658e85aa	It sounds like your husband is trying to alter your relationship to a "domestic discipline" format.  However, without your direct consent and approval, this simply won't work, and will become spousal abuse if he continues without your permission.  It's neither wrong nor right, and its success entirely depends on the couple.  Unlike what the defense attorney says, domestic discipline is perfectly legal in any state that allows consent as a defense, provided that consent was actually given.  If the idea disturbs you, then you would be right to leave the relationship or ask that he seek counseling, since he did try to force it rather than discuss it.  Even if you consider this relationship, you should still ask him to seek counseling, as he needs to know that he stepped out of line before he steps further.  Try looking up sites on domestic discipline relationships and see if they're right for you.  If nothing else, you might decide that you want to try such a relationship, but with you being the head of the household instead of him.

For instance, mothers will quite often not believe there own children if they tell there mothers they were sexually abused by there step father, uncle, etc. This happens a lot. I can tell you this, there is very high probability that your nephew was sexually abused by somebody in your immediate family or a close family friend. I doubt very seriously that he just randomly abused your grandson.  And your step father and mother thinking what he did was not bad is a sign of that honey. They very well may have been sexually abused themselves at some point. <br>  <br>             Please get your grandson to a child therapist and keep him away from your nephew.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	It sounds like you and your children are the normal ones in this family.  All children will do things that parents don't agree with such as the pot and the rice, but they grow up eventually.<br>  <br>  A child molestor on the other hand is not just a child being a child.  This kid needs HELP and by you reporting it as you did, may get him some help while the rest of the family seems fit to be his enabler.  <br>  <br>  Keep your distance and protect your own.  They don't need that at all.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	What you need to do is cut all ties with these creeps. They obviosuly have no care for your family and why should you stick around for the unjustified abuse from them? I say move on and concentrate on being the best parent you can to your children.

They have what they believe to be the golden child.  It is no wonder that he's messed up, being given all he wants and all.  But wait.  Sometimes there is an ulterior motive for someone to give someone all they want, they are buying a silence about something that shouldn't have happened.  How much do you know about this stepfather?  Has he done something to your nephew?  It is a fact that molesters have been molested themselves.  Which would mean that your nephew didn't see anything wrong with it, he was doing what he perceived to be normal kids things.  You might find more where you don't expect.  Keep you other kids out of that house for their own protection.  And yes you did the right thing turning him in.|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	Well, at least you sound healthy! So what if your kid smoked pot and the other one stole a bag of rice! Big Whoop!  They did minor offenses! He molested a baby! Pin his *** to the wall and good for you for not buying into their lets over look this minor incident and we all make mistakes attitude.  Hello thats how molesters keep getting away with this immorally damaging lifestyle on others. Heck yea their crazy when it comes to this decision and NO your nephew is not okay and far from it!

Some people are very touchy feely and enjoy to be touched all over, others aren't comfortable with it and it's a while until happens but it doesn't mean that they love/respect each other any more or less. If you are feeling uncomfortable with it though (either the touching itself or the comments he's making) then you need to speak to him about it. You answered the question yourself by saying has it given him the wrong message. This all may be totally innocent and hes suggesting more sexual views because maybe he thinks you might want it too. Not as a sleezy thing; just as the next step to a relationship. Whatever happens, good luck and be strong !  =]

Jwk7Ib2vaa	In my honest opinion, save yourself the exorbitant amounts of money it would cost for real flower centerpieces and go with the fake ones. You've spent enough money already on getting your dream wedding together, save the expense and spend it on the honeymoon. Your  close friends and family who'll be sharing this day with you won't care about having fake flowers in the middle of their table, they'll be eating and socializing and talking about your dress. <br>  Make an easy decision and go with matching imitation flowers, spend a little more than you would on dollar store fake ones, and you'll be fine.<br>  Enjoy your wedding, hope this helps!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	People claim otherwise but I have never seen silk flowers that look even remotely similar to real flowers. Even the crazy expensive high-quality silks that people say look real, I can usually tell even from a distance that they aren't. <br>  <br>  Unless you are using exotic flowers, real flowers are actually cheaper than silks. The exception is if you get silks from Walmart or the dollar store. Obviously those are cheaper but they don't usually look real.|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Don't use fake flowers, period.  If you can't afford real for the centerpieces, use something else -- candles, floating candles in pretty bowls, plants in pretty containers with ribbon, some sort of decorative piece, something organic, even glass containers filled with fruit, etc., -- anything, ANYTHING but fake flowers.|`|I4d5PCKQaa	No it will not.

uij93NOjaa	Yes, you have to send a thank you to everyone that attended the wedding........ whether or not they gave you money or a gift. <br>  <br>  If you aren't sure what to say, try something simple like ; Thank you so much for attending our special day! I hope you had as much fun as we did and we hope to see you soon....... <br>  <br>  Here are some other tips for writing a thank you for people who have given you something:<br>  <br>  Do personalize your notes and make reference to the person as well as the gift.<br>  Do remember that a gift should be acknowledged with the same courtesy and generous spirit in which it was given.<br>  Do be enthusiastic, but don’t gush. Avoid saying a gift is the most beautiful thing you have ever seen unless you really mean it.<br>  Don’t send form letters or cards with printed messages and just your signature; don’t use email or post a generic thank you on your wedding web site in lieu of a personal note.<br>  Do promptly acknowledge the receipt of shipped gifts by sending a note right away or calling and following up with a written note in a day or two.<br>  Don’t mention that you plan to return a gift or that you are dissatisfied in any way.<br>  Don’t tailor your note to the perceived value of the gift; no one should receive a perfunctory note.<br>  Do refer to the way you will use a gift of money. Mentioning the amount is optional.<br>  Don’t include wedding photos or use photo cards if it will delay sending the note.<br>  Don’t use being late as an excuse not to write. Even if you are still sending notes after your first anniversary, keep writing!<br>  <br>  I just had my wedding last year and it took forever to write them.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	A polite bride sends thank you cards to every guest (or every family/couple, for anyone who attended as a "unit") who came to her wedding, regardless of whether they brought a gift. She also sends a thank you card to anyone who gave/sent a gift but did not attend the wedding.<br>  <br>  In case you haven't noticed, the economy is not great. You don't have the inside scoop on everyone's personal finances. A $25 gift, in addition to the time and expense of attending your wedding, might be very generous for a family of 4 or 5 that is in danger of having someone get laid off.<br>  <br>  You invite people to a wedding because you want to celebrate your marriage with them, not because of the loot you will get from them. Have you hear the phrase "attitude of gratitude"? I think you need one.|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	Contrary to what others have said, the host does not thank guests for attending an event at which the host provided refreshments and/or entertainment (technically, the guest sends a thank-you note to the host, but that's not commonly done for weddings).  You send a formal, written thank-you to people who gave you a gift.|`|AA11312653	From an etiquette point of view, there are many points of incorrectness here. <br>  <br>  Mannerly people invite guests to their parties because they WANT to give these people a good time, not because they expect to be compensated for their trouble and expense. While it is very pleasant when a guest thanks for our party takes the form of a gift, if your party is a fundraiser then you should be frankly calling it a rent party and charging a set admission fee. <br>  <br>  All that guests OWE you is a handwritten letter of thanks, as in "thank you for including us in your wonderful party, we had a great time." People often CHOOSE to send a gift instead of or along with the letter of thanks but this is a free choice, not a requirement.<br>  <br>  Mannerly people entertain and give gifts based on their own income level. If a well off family invites a low income family to a party, and that party features expensive wines and foods served by uniformed servants, if the rich family sends the poor family expensive holiday gifts, it is not expected that the poor family respond in kind. Rather, the poor family invites their wealthy friends over for hamburgers and a movie, and sends them some home made cookies for holiday gifts. You give according to your ability and desire to give, not to "pay for" what you have received.<br>  <br>  The "congratulate the newlyweds in person" part of the party is a joint effort. The newlyweds do their part by seeking out each guest and thanking that guest for coming to the party, telling the guest how pleased they are to see him/her, and how well he/she looks. It is to be hoped that the guest responds by congratulating the couple and wishing them many years of happiness and so on. If not, then polite minded newlyweds consider that the guest is having so much fun that he/she momentarily forgot his/her manners and are pleased that the guest finds the party so enjoyable.<br>  <br>  Considerate guests send gifts before or after the party, and do not bring them to the party. Hosts already have a great deal to do and do not need the added responsibility of securing gifts from theives, keeping track of who brought what, and schlepping the stuff home. <br>  <br>  When it comes to a large effort like a wedding or family reunion or holiday gathering, the people most closely involved often consider that their involvement says so much about how much they care that a card would be redundant and trivial. I'm not sure what kind of card newlyweds would expect from the groom's mother anyhow. Thank you for letting me be a part of my own son's wedding? Congratualtions on becoming a part of our family?<br>  <br>  As to thanks, you send a personal handwritten message to every person who gives or sends you a gift. By personal I mean that you mention the gift, what you like about it, and something nice like "you looked so handsome in your suit, Uncle Fred." By handwritten, I mean no commercially preprinted messages allowed, not even the words thank you. <br>  <br>  You do not send thank you letters to attendees who did not give gifts. However, it would be gracious to send them a personal handwritten message saying that you are glad they could attend your party and that they looked very well. Do you see how this is subtly different from THANKING them for coming? It is guests who thank the host for giving the party, not the other way around. <br>  <br>  That other people may be more innocent or ignorant of good manners than oneself is just part of life. It is a waste of time and energy to be angry or bitter. One behaves in such a way that one is above reproach and contents onself with setting this good example, without brooding or fretting that others do not share ones own high standards.|`|AA11603468	Everyone.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	You send a thank-you to everyone who gave you a gift/card.|`|GXM74MGPaa	Everyone of course.|`|zgDQrI2uaa	It is correct to send thank-you cards to everyone who either attended the ceremony and/or sent the gift.  There are so many people today who think they are owed a gift because they invited someone to the wedding that it is shocking.  A gift is called a gift because it is freely given, other than that it would be called an, "I have to."  <br>  <br>  Sadly, there are people who feel the guests should thank them for attending their wedding because there is an expensive reception after wards.  The reception is a party hosted by the bride/groom/family, no host should feel that a guest at the party they choose to throw has to present a gift in lieu of the money spent on that guest's attendance.  <br>  <br>  The fact that someone bothered to get up, dress, drive, park, and go to your ceremony is deserving of thanks.  Suppose no one bothered to attend and just sent gifts; that would be one bad wedding day on the bride/groom's part.  The guests make the wedding special; for that they should be thanked.  If someone feels that their guest owe them, then they should not throw a party so much as send out mailers requesting gifts in exchange for suppers.  Sadly, some people are tacky enough to do this.  Good for you that you asked it shows you want to do the right thing!|`|VEi3R0craa	I don't know that right law on thank you cards but I would send them to everyone and personalize them.  If no gift came from them just say something like we would like to thank you for sharing our day with us.  And if a gift came from them like a toaster.  say something like every time we have toast we will think of you.|`|QmvYGkNJaa	I personally would send a card to everyone that came to your wedding, even if they didn't give a gift. Perhaps just say "thank you for joining us to celebrate our marriage", or something like that.<br>  <br>  Remember to thank people that gave a gift but couldn't attend.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I only sent a card to those who gave a card or gift. I actually had one that gave me an empty card and no gift so I sent them a card saying thank you for the card, I wanted to add you cheap **** but I couldn't!|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	Only to people who gave you a gift.  People usually thank everyone for coming during the reception so no thank you card is necessary.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	well, personaly, i would just send them to the ones who gave me a gift- the ones that didnt were rude not to!|`|AA11380378	To everyone in attendance; gift or not.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|UAF8Zxzaaa	My way of saying thanks to the guests for attending will be the little favors I will be giving out that will have thank-you notes in them. It is probably best to send a thank you letter to anyone who gave any sort of gift, no matter how cheap. They bothered to think of you and get you something, or give you money. <br>  <br>  If you invite people to your wedding, you shouldn't expect anyone to give you a gift in return. They should obviously celebrate with you, congratulate you, and be happy for you, and make great memories. The money you spend should be for your (bride and groom's) enjoyment on that day. You pay for people because you want to treat them to food and for them to celebrate with you.|`|eL268hETaa	Depends on who you want to thank.  If someone shared your special day, and you want to thank them for doing so, they do it.  If you think Uncle Harold's ex-brother-in-law only tagged along for a free meal and open bar, then dont bother acknowledging.  When I got married, a distant cousin showed up WITHOUT AN RSVP response bringing her FIVE CHILDREN along for free food when the invitations had specifically excluded children.  I was not impressed, and neither were my parents, who paid PER HEAD for a planned sit-down dinner in advance.  I sent a terse obligatory thank you for her gift (which was very cheap BTW) but that was the last invite she got from anyone in our family for any reason.<br>  <br>  Only you can decide whom you thank.  But tradition dictates that it is common courtesy to thank gift-givers, whether they were able to attend or not.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Well first of all, you don't know the situation the people are in. Maybe they are struggling financially and could only afford to give $25. They probably weren't just their to eat the food, but felt like they should be there since you invited them. Send a thank you to everyone to thank them for "celebrating your special day with you."|`|AA11277450	I only sent cards to those who sent or brought a gift. If you want to be nice, you could send one to everyone who attended thanking them for sharing your day, but I don't think it is required.|`|5dd9437d2887d5800d393adb8a4b516faa	Couple of things:<br>  <br>  1) As rude as it is, it is not required to give a gift<br>  2) As unhappy as it might have made you, maybe $25 is all these people could afford.  It is rough out there these days.  At least they gave you something<br>  <br>  I would only send thank you cards to people who gave a gift or a card (even if it was $25)  The people who came and brought nothing were thanked with a meal and I assume you thanked people for coming at the wedding.<br>  <br>  **EDIT** I asked my 82 year old grandfather what he thought about this.  He said that if you send a thank you note to someone who did not give a gift, it is almost like asking them to send you a gift.  You should have thanked everyone at the wedding for coming.  Then afterwards you send thank you notes only to those who have given a card or gift because they have done something to deserve a thank you note.  You have nothing to thank the other people for.

kUE3Ddktaa	Since you have a contract, you have legal recourse. Tell them that they need to refund the rush-order fee, since they will not deliver by the date you paid for. If they do not, let them know you'll be in touch with a lawyer and the Better Business Bureau.<br>  <br>  Second, don't panic. You can get your dress altered in 3 weeks - lots of women do. A smart tactic here would be to call seamstresses NOW, instead of when the dress arrives. Tell them your situation and see if someone is willing to keep some space open on her calendar for when your dress comes in. That way, you aren't scrambling to find someone.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Create merry hell, if you have paid for a rush order then you are within your rights to demand you get what you paid for, if they cant deliver what they advertise and what you pay for then you should get a refund and gt a dress elsewhere.|`|bf6K6uubaa	You can either back out of the deal (because they broke the contract) and get another dress...or you'll just have to wait.  On the plus side alterations will not take 3 weeks to make...so you'll still be okay on timing.  The bad thing is you don't want them to rush and do a bad job on your dress...and yes you paid for the rush so you NEED to get that money refunded...let them know that you'll need a refund of the rush fee and you'll be expecting their call asap....you might also want to look at back up dresses just in case,|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I would ask to be refunded for the rush service.  3 weeks is still plenty of time for alterations.  My bridesmaids didn't get their dresses until the day before my wedding and the seamstress was able to get all their alterations done before the wedding.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	If you have it in the contract then you have all the proof you need. Demand that they follow the terms of the contract of you can sue or cancel the contract at any time and go with someone else. You have the upper hand since you have it in writing.|`|R4WX5twzaa	If you have it in writing, that's awesome. By giving you your dress in 3.5 months instead of the 6 weeks that they promised you, they are in direct violation of the contract, and you can sue them for the extra money you paid them to do the rush order. In addition, if you end up having to pay extra for rush alterations, or if the alters just can't get the dress done on time for your wedding, you can probably try to sue them for the full cost of the dress as well as the money you paid them to rush it. Just make sure you can prove everything, and keep that contract in a safe place.<br>  <br>  *EDIT* Important pieces of paper to keep: any contracts made involving the dress (make sure you get everything in writing); any receipts for the dress itself, alterations, etc; if the alters can't finish your dress in the remaining three weeks, have them write an official letter to you; and anything else that you think is important. You can never have too much paper work, but too little is bad.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	Don't sound angry when you call, this will not help your cause at all. Call the company, say that you just received an email but it must be a mistake because you specifically paid for 6 week rush delivery. If they say that it wasn't a mistake, ask why the dress is suddenly going to take so long. I would be really upset if I was you, but don't yell or get catty because that won't help at all. If they won't budge about the dress, then I would get your money back and go somewhere else, because that kind of service is unacceptable.|`|IWWZdZRpaa	You should get your rush order money back and the place should alter it for free.  Call, and be calm when you call you get better results that way even if it is their mistake, and talk to them.  You can always take them to small claims court after the wedding and get your money back.  Don't stress too much though it really is out of your control.|`|QikvnTnqaa	3.5 months? Did they say why so long? You should definatly at LEAST get your rush delivery money back. Call and find out what's they delay. Maybe they just missed that yours was a rush delivery. Find that out first. Otherwise. I would be throwing a huge fit. My wedding day is on a special day for the two of us, so if that happend.....OMG.<br>  <br>  Call and see if this is just a mix up first, but if not, work on a refund. :D<br>  <br>  Good luck! And Congrats!|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	Bring the contract with you to the store- demand your dress as well as a FULL refund (since they breached your contract they by law have to) then take your dress to another place that can meet your deadline.|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Get your money back first.  Look into taking the dress elsewhere to have it properly done in time.
EM5rQOGBaa	i think alot of women are more about the big day than the marriage it's self , many women want a fairytale wedding ,big white dress,horse n carriage,etc ( which i think famous ppl like jordan & the beckhams have not helped with as ther weddings wer over the top which makes ppl want to copy them ). am engaged n getting married nxt year n don't want anything like dat , we just want a simple wedding with our family & good friends,<br>  <br>  i am more in2 the idea of marriage making us have a stronger bond , my parents split when i was 3 , so i always knew from young that i wanted to marry for the right reasons unlike my parents. i know alot of people who think marriages means nothing , but i think that if u have a gd relationship & are happy not to marry that is your own choice .|`|QmvYGkNJaa	I never intended to get married, because when my parents divorced I thought getting married was a waste of time. I grew up thinking I would be a career woman, and if I did have kids, I wouldn't bother with getting married, as it was just a formality. <br>  <br>  But it all changed when I met my fiance. Because I hadn't been planning a wedding like so many other girls, I've been able to look at everything critically and decide whether we really need it. I never had the dream to travel to a church in a horse-drawn carriage, so it was easy to just say we would drive there ourselves. <br>  <br>  Perhaps that's something you could use? I don't really know what you want to know, but you can message me if you want to ask me any questions.|`|aipChC3haa	I am having an extravagant wedding, and the only reason I am spending $35,000 on it is because I know that we will ALWAYS love each other no matter what, and it doesn't matter who get's in the way because he will always be mine, and I will always be his.<br>  <br>  But, I do understand what you mean about how people just want to plan a wedding, and they  don't even care about anything else.<br>  <br>  I would LOVE to contribute.<br>  Email me =)
9447ea59c0351320e67d694a57a85105aa	Apperently you like him ;)<br>  And he wants to get to know you.... so next time be open and talk.<br>  Just go like " Hey, aren't you (name, if you know it) from ( grade) grade?, I'm ( your name ), I think you know my friend pretty well" and then he should talk too if he is mature....or if he ain't shy.... then talk....lol|`|AA10928214	Why don't you tell you're friend that you want to meet him, or tell her it's always awkward when you guys are together because she hasn't introduced you two. Once you "get you're foot in the door" it will be easier to talk to him.|`|W8xQKafjaa	he definetly finds you attractive. If he is older than you and gets nervous in your presence, then you should confront him and take charge. Introduce yourself, flip your hair around, and smile at him and look him right in the eye!<br>  <br>  talk to him on myspace or text him if he's not so good with face to face conversation at first, and see where that takes you.|`|zO59ezH3aa	It would have been embarrasying for me. He felt akwarf because he likes u alot. If I were u would get to know the guy. If she with him just say hi it really isn't bad after u get to know the guy.|`|Ai4kGM1Oaa	Well he probably felt awkward because he was sitting next to a couple of younger girls he barely knew who weren't paying any attention to him. And I'm guessing if he's like most of us "men" he just smiles and stares at all the ladies. In order for it not to be awkward, I would just immediately start pulling out pick-up lines, you know, the cheesy ones, then as you, and ideally your friend are berating him with flattering lines the tension lessons and you can have a normal conversation like people who aren't in middle school.
1464ecdcfadeab01b7311ac3309b1c15aa	They probably think ur HOTT whenever i see a guy who's hott its kinda hard not to stare..and every girl thinks differently so how can u ever know|`|AnfbrZFuaa	They either were joking around, or they thought you were cute. Probably the latter. Or they were curious what color of eyes you had.|`|eSp3Gx8iaa	When ladies make eye contact...its good. Especially if they smile. But most of the time, you have to smile first for them to smile back.
vyNlyfczaa	for me it sounds like she is not happy in her marriage, has regards about this what she did (that she is with this other guy not with you)!<br>  and you with this what you did made her angry because you sent her back her stuff so in my mind you act like the better person, still kind and good! <br>  Don't worry about her! Try to move on with your life and find someone who will deserve you and will respect you! because you sound like a good guy!|`|X7rPWJU8aa	she has issues and you should just ignore her and let it go.  go out and have some great sex with some one who just wants a romp around . and don't answer her calls emails etc..|`|fMEypXDYaa	Sounds like she said one thing to you and something else to her new husband and her family, and most likely figured you would stay in the past, so when the package came in for her, she was stunned about it and most likely her husband wasn't very happy about it either, and it caused the family to react, based on what she told them about the reason for the break up. Just drop the matter and move with your life, you learned something about past relationships from all of this, mainly to let the past stay in the past. Think subconsciously you sort of hoped she'd get in touch with you, to say thanks or something like that.|`|8130732466e5c537088eddfef54bd90faa	Sounds like a lying, cheating, B****.  They are out there.  Just write it off and move on.  (Not the easiest thing to do, but what else is there?)<br>  <br>  Hard to explain someone else's motives.  Don't let it tear you up.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	her new husband probably got pissed at her, therefore she just took her anger out on you to show her husband she agreed with him so he wouldnt be mad at her anymore.<br>  <br>  real healthy relationship lol. be glad you are rid of her!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Let it go...have some great break up sex with someone else and get over it...time to move on.|`|U3RCBmKJaa	yea she prob wasnt over the guy who she left you for or had been seeing him all along to she dosent care you need to find you a good woman i wish i could find me a man like you|`|PbwCVPL1aa	I agree that her husband did get pissed at her. Next time any part of her family try's to contact u don't answer the phone, if u have call display turn off your answering machine, take all of them off of your mailing list on the computer. You have to move on with out her and if u can't do it then get some councling to do it. Don't let her or her family upset u anymore. They r not worth it. Hang in there it will get better.|`|eL268hETaa	Sweetie, you've cleaned her 'stuff' out of your closet, but you need to clear the person out as well.  You did a nice considerate thing.  Who cares what she got her knickers in a twist over.  Maybe she didn't want her parents to know you weren't dead and got caught in a lie.  Don't spend your time fretting over what you did wrong.  She is the one with issues.<br>  <br>  GOOD RIDDANCE TO BAD TRASH.  Time to take the garbage out, (emotional and otherwise) and find someone who deserves your kind attention!|`|jlUczlQZaa	You need closure and are living in the past.  She was angry because you "reconnected" with her through her parents by sending her belongings to them and created unnecessary drama in her life.  You know you should of just trashed her belongings because if she wanted them she would of contacted you.<br>  <br>  She did not handle the ending of your relationship well and you are paying the price by trying to recapture something that is over.  However, it is necessary for you to find enough self-respect and strength to understand that relationships are difficult and do not always end the way we wanted.  She made her decision and you must now respect it and leave the past in the past.<br>  <br>  Stop all contact with her and find happiness in your life by focusing on work, interests, family, etc.
Hllb2fPGaa	I Think NOT this girl is using you, i know when i see a slag at this sounds like her. leave her to he own misery and live ur bloody life|`|Y2k81CWWaa	I think if you take her to the prom, she'll get the wrong idea. Maybe take a friend who isn't your ex.|`|F0mE7l3xaa	don't take her to the prom. go with someone else. shes using you as a rebound because shes sure you'll always take her back. find someone else to go with. also tell her you know the truth the whole time.|`|onrcmQf8aa	How is going to the prom making you the bigger person?

The first time we date before homecoming i cheated on him and broke up with him but after i (we didnt talk for mounths after we broke up) asked him to homecoming we started to hang out and 2 days later we started giong back out. long stry short if you want to risk giong back out with her then yah (or if shes easy and you want to get layed then also say yah). p.s ive never cheated on my boyfreind agian and now i feel even stronger in love then before with him sometimes old relationship can make great new flames.(sry about the lenghtyness and spelling errors)
IXskJPlVaa	She hasn't indicated any thing contrary to your line of thinking - so why do you worry. Just discuss everything with her and always keep her involved in your decision making - it will work out. There doesn't seem to be much of a problem - just relax and take it easy. Best of luck.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	In your details, you say she has already said that she would come with you, and that she loves your country.  Therefore, my honest opinion is this: if you love her so much you're thinking of marrying her, love her enough to trust that she is telling you the truth.|`|UFOdwXgfaa	That's a huge sacrifice to take so my best advice is to talk to her and give her some time to think things over. Don't put pressure on her because you'll only make things worse and you might lose her along the way. So step back and let her think things through|`|Q4fOTUNNaa	you are thinking too much and that's the real complication.  She will be with you for sure after your marriage. So stop thinking and simply marry her.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	If it's meant to be - it will be...<br>  <br>  You are just talking Geography.  I'd be happy to be with my husband no matter where in the world we lived.|`|xuiSfzgraa	If she has said that she would move to your country and she has visited there and loves it, I don't see what the problem would be.  I am sure if you made the effort to  set aside time every so often to come back here so she can visit her friends and family, and make them feel welcome to come visit you guys as well it will make it much easier for her to make the move.
IXskJPlVaa	Every lady wants to be a mother - so nothing selfish about it. Your assumption about the time frame may not be entirely correct. You are mentally and otherwise ready to conceive right now - he is not. Just relax and go ahead with the other plans - may be sometime during his schooling he get in the mood and agrees to your proposal. Studies help a person develop rather than restrict, so hope for the best. Best of luck.|`|qXkTatLMaa	No, I don't think that you are being selfish.  You may be right about him going to school and raising his self esteem.  If he is not working right now, the thought of having another child may be a bit much right now.  i would support him regarding returning to school.  After he finishes, and begins to work again, he may change his mind, and be ready to entertain the subject of a child.  But right now, I would not press for the child.  Let your husband have a chance to feel solid again by bringing in income into the household.  Then he will feel better about adding an additional mouth to feed.  I wish you the best.|`|UFOdwXgfaa	I don't see what the problem is so no, you're not being selfish|`|hmNY4gQtaa	this could go forever on end, just accept the circumstances, they will never be perfect<br>  <br>  is your husband a perfectionist ?|`|H3WHxCgaaa	He's 40 and still hasn't decided what to with his life?  Good luck getting him to start a family with you now...A man without a plan at 40 is just about as good as a man without a plan at 20.  Neither are going to get very far...at least the 20 year old has time on his side.<br>  <br>  I think it's do or die time.  You tell him that this is the opportunity to start a family - or it's a deal breaker...in the interim - he should be able to find a job of some sort - even if it's not one he wants over the long term.  Any job is better than no job in my book.|`|uvXgD9Ygaa	You may have money now but what happens when you get pregnant and have a baby, if your husband isn't working, where is the income coming from?  What happens if it's a difficult pregnancy and you can't work, where is money coming from?  How in your 30's are you?  If you are over 35, its best to do it sooner rather than later but again, financially is it going to be stable?  There has to be huge sacrifices on both sides to make this work if he wants to go to school for a year (if it's longer than it gets more difficult).  If he goes to school now for a year, and you both work on getting you pregnant, he will be done school by the time you have your baby.  Then there is no reason for him not to be able to find work so you can leave on maternity and he can bring in the income.<br>  <br>  If he goes to school for more than a year, he can look at going part time so he can still find a job and go to school in the evenings.  I mean the recession should be lifted by 2010, there will be no reason for him not working, and again that leaves it open for you to have a baby in the next year.  Pregnancy is nine months so that gives you a year leeway, generally from the time of trying to delivery, maybe more.  To hold off on even trying when you so badly want a baby and are getting up in age (I'm sorry if that's rude, I'm 31), would be selfish of him.  <br>  <br>  It will work if you both want the same things.|`|CQsD09D6aa	I can fully understand his desire to wait to start a family in light of the fact that he is unemployed. He wishes to be a provider and is obviously unable to do so. Let him finish school before getting pregnant. You are still young and can wait a couple of years. You are lucky to have a husband with such a good head on his shoulders. Cheers to him.|`|0UUDFxR0aa	If you are waiting to have the money to have a baby, you will always be waiting.|`|AA12149655	Pray about it.  God works in his time.  When the time is right for you to have a child together...you will...if that's God's plan.<br>  Mark 11:22-24 (New International Version)<br>  <br>   22"Have[a] faith in God," Jesus answered. 23"I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. 24Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	he probably isn't as anxious because he has a child from a previous relationship but if it is important to you to have your own children then you need to have a conversation with him about when he will be ready to have a child with you. as women get closer to 40 they have a higher risk to have children with mental and physical disabilities. Dr's don't recommend a woman to get pregnant after 35 so if you think you're going to go beyond that childless you might want to have your eggs frozen.|`|PCw1zDtsaa	I personally think that he is not ready for a child (with you) Regardless of the economy. I went through the same thing with my spouse. I was trying to get pregnant for three years. He insisted that he would rather have anal sex, disgusting. He has four children already and he did not want one from me. My pregnancy was an accident, I am now four months pregnant and he is cheating. Find another guy. Maybe his life goals are not the same as yours.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	I think its good if you wait. right now only having one income is scary because with the economy what if you loose your job then you have no income coming in, what what if you get sent to bed rest while pregnant? there's alot of what ifs. and you shouldnt use your savings to financially care for your baby. you may need that some day soon also. i would wait for your husband to get out of school then start your family. You'll be more financially stable and maybe at that point you could quit your job and be a stay at home mom. plus if your husband's not ready then he wont fully commit to being a good father. you both need to compromise so both of you can have what you want. i know when your wanting a baby a year or 2 seems like a long time but its really not a long time if you look at the big picture. i think you'll be able to enjoy it more and be more prepared if you don't make quick decisions|`|mbYdd4UUaa	For a woman, sometimes it's not complete if you don't have a child.In this situation, I think he feels that he can't provide cuz he doesn't have a job which is understandable. Let him go back to school. 1 year is not really long to wait. Discuss the issue with your OBGYN if waiting another year might be a problem having the baby then . meeting with the doc with him might make him realize that this is the proper time...

2FNfyxVqaa	Just be careful that he says he's not ready for a relationship because he is not over his ex but yet he is still sleeping with you. I was in a situation like that once before and the end result turned out that i was just being used by this guy that i was so gaga over and thought i was in love with. <br>  <br>  I would honestly say that most relationships stemming out of rebounds don't last because this guy is having a sexual relationship and may only have you there because of rebound so once he's healed from her you may not be of any use to him except for sexual purposes.<br>  <br>  I think as long as you watch yourself and don't put your heart into this type of relationship then it should be ok. Get what you want out of it, and at this point it's sex, and just enjoy it but like i said watch your heart because 9 times out of 10 it's YOU that will get hurt.|`|mefxIQP9aa	Most rebounds fail.<br>  <br>  You should just stop lying to yourself and admit to him that you just want to have a "FWB" relationship.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	to Mike the Man<br>  <br>   you don't answer like a man - you answer like an animal in heat!<br>  <br>  that is the difference between man and beast, man has developed a conscience and lack of it is what's wrong with society today. No morals and screwed up families!!!<br>  <br>  You should truly love the person you have sex with.<br>  <br>  Good in bed does not a strong relationship make, yourb/f has told you he's still getting over his ex (probably a polite way of saying you're not the one)|`|Aj8Gqtkyaa	It sounds to me like you had already gotten serious if you've already slept with this guy.<br>  Both of you sound like sex dogs to me anyways.<br>  Who cares what happens to you?|`|kHRD7uUAaa	why can't you women just take it for what it is,  sex.  so why not have sex with him don't you want to enjoy sex if so then just do it|`|c22c8f9d77d6ed911976dd38531a7aa7aa	If you really like having sex with him then keep doing it, i mean maybe this will help him get over his ex more sooner.|`|yiUNN8ADaa	Give it time and see where it goes. Don't have sex with him if he's not ready. If he is cool with it, go for it. My current boyfriend was a rebound for me and we have been together for a year.

Wait it out and see what happens.|`|heMWDrLnaa	show him the time of his life and make him forget about his ex ;)|`|ccs35Stgaa	wow lolz if hes cool with it then go for it...watever floats ur boat mamacita|`|qy2CIDmlaa	GOOD SEX should have came Last as a bonus if  he was everything else you want in a man.  Now  He  just  wants to Get Off.    Thats why he said that to you.  He would be using you and you would ge using him.   If thats  all you want then its fine.  But if you want a long term relationship you should not be making  the sex your #1  priority.    Too many people put  SEX first ant then hope everything else falls into place.   You should put  his character, personality and morals first.   GOOD SEX  should be a Bonus  if everything if he's  everything else you want in a relationship.  Its sound to me like you would be just an easy Lay for him and then he would eventually move on to someone else who he really cares for.  Of course he likes you now.  You're an easy Lay. Sorry to be so blunt.   But Im trying to be honest.  I hope this helps.   Take Care......

wpEoqEVXaa	You need to pick your time to tell him. Don't talk to him about this when you are in bed or when you are about to have sex or just finished. <br>  <br>  Make a nice private dinner at your home for just the two of you. After a nice meal you simply say you want to have a conversation. Start by telling him how you feel about him. How much you love him and how happy you are to be together. Then say how much you enjoy having sex with him. Make it go something like this.<br>  <br>  I really enjoy our making love, but i have a small problem. I seem unable to orgasm when you are on top, i think it's just the positioning and such. But when i am on top, i orgasm every time. I was hoping we can work something out that would allow me to be on top more often. I still highly enjoy our love life when you are on top, but i would like to be on top more often. Quite frankly, the more i orgasm and enjoy our love making, the more i am going to want to make love. <br>  <br>  See, give him a benefit to it all with that last sentence. Make it worth his while to want to be on bottom. When you do get on top, place his hands on your breasts or even on your clitorus, maybe even one on each? If he starts enjoying the use of his hands, he might enjoy being on bottom. <br>  <br>  Quite frankly, this is basically true for all women. It's far easier to position things in the exact right spot when the woman is on top. For all men out there.... most women like it on top best. It's very hard for a man to find the woman's g-spot with his penis. But a woman on top can position you just right and make sure it hits there every time, hightening her experience 10 fold! <br>  <br>  Anyway, this shouldn't hurt his feelings. Make it a rewarding talk and not one that says he isn't good enough. Just explain this last little bit i wrote. How you can make sure he hits the right spot every stroke and he'll like the thought of that. I explained it to my husband a few years ago and i've been on top almost every time since and he now loves to have his hands free and roaming to wherever takes his fancy.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Happy 2 has the right idea!  I can't imagine staying in one position, tell him you want a turn. ;o)|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Try doggy fashion.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	The obvious solution is to take turns.  You start off on top, and stay there until you get an orgasm.  Then, switch it up and let him be on top until he gets his.  When you discuss this, it doesn't have to be a big deal - just say what you want and why, and propose the taking turns idea.  I don't see why people seem to think you have to stay in only one position during sex.|`|gPlUDaRoaa	Well,i don't see why when he is asking you why,you don't just tell him why you like it better on top.He is your husband,so you should be able to tell him anything.Your reason for wanting to be on top shouldn't hurt his feelings.You both are trying to achieve the same thing right?So just tell him.|`|vyNlyfczaa	offer to change the positions - first you on the top and then him on the top:)|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Tell him just what you told all of us and he should understand.|`|QJslTCUBaa	He's selfish.|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	You gotta share positions of dominance and submission... don't tell him about the inability to climax... just encourage lots of new things and tell him that you want to play... You could always tie his hands to the headboard and his ankles to the bed-frame... and then tease him for a long time before you let him finish....... that would teach him!|`|hjc2y3TMaa	LOL, This is the man you are going to be having sex with for the REST of your life.

Make it all about the way he makes you feel when you are on top.  In other words stroke his ego.|`|1HLPznZhaa	Any husband that would have his feelings hurt over this needs all the help he can get..If my wife ever suggested this we still might be married !!

You won't hurt his feelings. The communication about this aspect of your lives is completely critical if you value your relationship. Do not let something as simple as this become the source of a problem. Instead, tell him the things you like and need, and promise him you'll do the same for him. As a result, you'll both be more satisfied--not just for yourself, but also in knowing you truly satisfied your partner.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	if you guys are husband and wife and having sex you guys should be able to communicate openly about what feels better. unless your husband is selfish he's going to put you in the position where you can ***. i would just tell him exactly what you told us and he should understand. my husband holds off on getting off until i get off and he loves it when i take control and tell him what position i want to be in. also my husband loves the sound of me orgasming so he'll do just about anything to hear that. so just talk to your husband and if he gets his feelings hurt then he's just too sensitive..|`|bIimm8fSaa	Tell him you would like to try all sorts of positions.

I'm not saying issue an ultimatum or cut him off altogether.  The way you need to approach this is by saying:<br>  <br>  You know, you're right, I don't have the right to pressure you into marriage.  But I do have a son to consider and my own needs and I need to start taking care of those needs also.  While I respect your independence, you need to respect mine also.  Therefore, no more weekend sleepovers.  This isn't good for my son and I don't see it leading anywhere in our relationship.  If you want to come over, come over, but I'm done being the one doing al the chasing in our relationship.<br>  <br>  More or less, you're at an impasse in your relationship.

Your son is more important.  <br>  <br>  At least this man is being honest about not wanting to commit.  Does he ever come and stay at your place?

You're your sons mum, so its up to you what happens with your lil boy. blaming your bf is wrong. Hes not ready to live with you and your son, but that doesnt make him bad, or selfish.|`|AosW4IvHaa	Set, set, set him free.. He is telling you he wants sex with you cause he likes sex... But that's all he wants.  The sooner you know that the better off all three of you will be.|`|tRcO5uyiaa	You and this man are not compatible at all. You obviously have very different ideas about what you want from life. There is no reason to stay with this man. He is not willing to share his life you, or with any woman. Just pack your things from his place and go back home. Your son will be grateful, and you will be able to keep your attention to him on weekends as well, until he gets a bit older.<br>  <br>  For future reference, you do not need to feel so "impatient" to 'merge' into a relationship with someone for any reason. I personally do not understand why some women do this. Maybe it seems to give a secure feeling, but if a man is adamant towards you about anything to do with your personal relationship, he is not the one for you. "Taking the next step of moving in together" is not an answer to anything. It is not a step. People in a healthy relationship do not do this, but many do for convenience, for time saving, to be "together" as much as possible because of busy work schedules etc. When dating for a long time, couples take time and sit down and talk about what each wants in their future. If the couple's wants and needs are similar or at least their interests are common, then they would discuss a committment. This means discussing marriage, not living together. That is not a committment. If anything were to go wrong, or tough times showed up in any way, people who are not married can just walk away from each other (too much of that already happens now) whereas in marriage, a couple works out their differences and gets through them together. They end up being closer than before the incident. I've been married for years and understand this concept. I don't know what the outcome of your situation will be, but I wish you the best.|`|uaSWp7fUaa	Ok, where to begin.  Does your boyfriend have any children?  That is the first question.<br>  <br>  If you force your son to live with him it will only get worse.  Yes he will tolerate your boyfriend but he will make you feel guilty for it for a long time.  Your boyfriend is possibly scared about commitment when your son is acting bad cause he is afraid your son will win in the end and you will leave.<br>  <br>  Another theory,  he doesn't need to commit!  You are doing all the running and changing and he is perfectly comfortable, why change now, it's all good for him.  <br>  <br>  If you want to settle down you need someone who is willing to give and take.  If someone truly loves you they will meet your needs as well as you meeting theirs, and not only yours but the needs of the child you already have.  Don't rush into something simply because you feel your child bearing years are passing you by, you will only mess up your life and the life of the child you already have.  If it isn't working, end it, but I think you already know that and just want some support.<br>  <br>  Your son needs to be first in any choices you make with your life and with his, he is already here and your responsiblity is to him and you first.
VEi3R0craa	this is not true first of all your ex can't collect on anything gained or earned after the divorce but your boyfriend needs to talk to a lawyer he is very uneducated on this matter and he is listening to someone with even less.

Tell him that you want a 7 day break and during that time apart one suggests he thinks of ways how to prove his love for you that he is sorry for what he has done . Be strong have very little contact with him and stick to your guns .<br>     Soon a couple of days shall pass and as sure as the Pope is a catholic flowers chocolates and candy will start to arrive , this is always helpful cause you can give the flowers and candy to a friend or member of family if they feel down .<br>  <br>    This chap of yours will think that he has done enough in proving he is sorry , but you then tell him that since you have been apart you have noticed how your friends husbands or partners are always doing jobs for them , and it makes you feel sad cause he never seems to do any jobs for you .<br>   Your fiancee by this time will be desperate to have you back so will want to prove that he is just as good as the next man , that he is as good as your friends husbands and partners . So any jobs that you , your friends , or family need doing , get him to do them cause he will obey , for example fixing a fence or painting the outside of a house .<br>  <br>   Once all the jobs and tasks that you set him are completed he will then feel confident in himself that he has finally proven to you that he is sorry and ask you to return into his arms .<br>    After all the jobs have been done you then mention that again since being apart from him you also noticed that your friends husbands or partners treat their wives or girlfriends to shopping trips and lunches with their friends , tell him this also makes you feel sad cause he doesn't seem to treat you . One can be certain that your chap will not want to feel lagging behind in this competition regarding your friends husbands and partners , so be prepared for lots of shopping trips , and lunches with your friends in the most expensive restaurants that you can find to dine in .<br>  <br>    Finally your fiancee will beg you to meet him cause the poor chap will be exhausted from your constant demands and tasks that you set him in proving his love to you , probably a lot poorer too .This is when<br>   you tell him that you are now ready to meet him but do stress that it will be at a restaurant of your choice and that he will be paying . Again make sure you choose the most expensive restaurant you can find cause your chap will be desperate to see you and will not hesitate in paying for the meal .<br>   Over dinner your fiancee will tell you how sorry he is that he has missed you , how much he loves you , how he never wants to be apart from you again , to come back to him to think of the future the marriage how you will both grow old together enjoy plenty of good times , and he will smile at you and end with the words " So what do you say ? , come back to me please ".<br>  <br>    After he has finished you tell him that his words were sincere that the meal was adorable , that you have thought long and hard about the pair of you your future , but the answer to his question if you will return to him is NO .Tell him that it will never happen that you see no future with him , that the engagement is off , that you will never marry him and to now concentrate on going your separate ways . Do tell him to be strong in dealing with the changes to his life in the future without you by his side .<br>          One hope this has been of some use , kindest regards , cheerio .|`|B6cOlFU9aa	It depends on what he did. Keep the wedding postponed, and take some time to think, possibly separated. Once you have gotten over the initial anger and hurt, see if you are still willing to make it work.

Try to think of it this way: are these mistakes enough to keep you from being together for the rest of your life?|`|Y7uOBffQaa	let me tell u once the lies start they dont stop  as much as u would love to belive him u never will do u constantly want to be wondering if hes lying?as sad as it may be, the best thing is to call the wedding off and move on.i dont know u , but i can tell u that u deserve MUCH better good luck|`|IWWZdZRpaa	That's a big lie.  I'd be very concerned if I were you.  What was he doing when he said he was going to work?  How were the finances going to be handled.  Postpone the wedding for a long time.|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	If he loved you he wouldnt have done those things.|`|Zx7yr4zjaa	dump him. You'll find a guy who actually deserves you.|`|FzFSzilmaa	if you can't trust him, you are going to have one miserable marriage...|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	It depends what he did, if it envolved anoher woman then there would be no going back for me. Without details its hard to give an opinion.|`|AA11603468	Then actually take it one step at a time. If you find over the coming months and years that you can trust him, then you go ahead an marry him, but I don't really see the point. He's already hurt you, the spell is broken. You r relationship will probably never be the same, now that you have doubt about him.
S1LxX6CNaa	ask her and bring her flowers of some type not roses though those r a little 2 lovey. <br>  <br>  To be genuine, pick a bunch of colorful wildflowers and wrap a piece of ribbon around the stalks and tie it off with a bow! <br>  <br>  If you want to go commercial, stick with daisies, tulips, with babies breath or some greenery mixed in.<br>  <br>  Either way, she'll appreciate your efforts! and Probably say yes to your Prom :-p|`|mLabzxnIaa	Ay hoe. you comin to da prom wit me.|`|l9wTE5eCaa	Find out her class schedule. Go to one of her teachers and ask for permission to give a short announcement (asking her to the Prom) right before class starts.<br>  <br>  Most female teachers will say yes because they are human.<br>  <br>  Bring a bouquet of flowers or chocolate or balloons, and go to that class that you arranged (skip or be late to your own class for a few minutes if you have to), and just ask her to Prom in front of the whole class. Unless if she's your mortal enemy, she will be extremely flattered and say yes. <br>  <br>  I've tried this and it works. ;)|`|Ai4kGM1Oaa	First of all, may I say, "You dawg!" I bet you got full this weekend.<br>  <br>  And B, what you should say is, <br>  <br>  "So I hear there's a prom coming up. Yeah, and I don't know why, but legend has it that 'boys' are supposed to go with 'girls.' Ridiculous right? Anyway, I've never been one to spit at tradition, so seeing as how you're the cutest girl I know, I was wondering if you'd do me the honor of going with me... you know... for tradition."<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work then everything I've learned from teen romantic comedies is a lie.|`|mWci5WUBaa	Go up to her and ask her its not that hard....|`|VlxBs9zyaa	will you go to prom with me?|`|est2Sryhaa	" we have been friends for a while, and i have admired you in every way possible. I feel that our relationship could easily ben taken to a new level, so i am going to sink a level to one knee and take you hand *take hand* please... *insert name here* will you go to the prom with me? :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D"|`|NLtFRuCKaa	Talking fetal horse.|`|Tw7o2Uagaa	No you won't.|`|o9QqsgYGaa	go 4 it! wtf!
onrcmQf8aa	It means you as almost as close to him and special to him as his daughter is.  For example,  I sometimes call my god brother by my real brother's name because my god brother is like a brother to me.|`|FKqtAhjraa	I think you are right.|`|uh31vpUkaa	i wudnt worry about him calling u hes daughters name...id be more worrid him calling u by hes ex <br>  <br>  LOL|`|hHndD5SEaa	Im pretty sure its just a slip of the tongue!!!<br>  xx|`|4wo4aWJ6aa	i agree you and his daughter are dear to his heart. when he called you his daughters name, it was prob  just cause something reminded him of her or her was on his mind! its not a bad thing! now if it was another girls name then i would worry! but just take it as it is! he prob just got confused for a sec! <br>  <br>  i often call my husband my son's name! lol! i can be helping my son with something and go to call my husband and i call him kris, my sons name! we laugh and he tells me to slow down lol! <br>  <br>  its not a big deal, unless you are seeing some kinda warnings that it could be something else! i really hope its just a mix up of nanes!|`|gLXzVbm8aa	i think your friend is right..thats sweet of him accidentally telling you how important you are.  good thing he did not call you someone else's name|`|zLXmOXkBaa	I think you're right. It doesn't mean much other than he might have been thinking about her, or was with her before you.
KLQWJrRyaa	You are completely and totally right! The fact that she party's a lot with her friends and wants to try drugs is not a good thing to put on a dating application if you know what I mean. I know that you guys are young and that she may want to experience things but there is a limit to that. You accepting her will to do drugs wont help anyone. Especially you because you are the one who has to tolerate every side effect this may cause. My advice to you is to try to talk it out with her and if she still seems to not want to change then you put on your hottest clothes, call your friends up and go somewhere. Remember the best thing about the ocean is that it has many varieties of fish!
HL8PEDFLaa	I'm not sure. Most magazines are targeted to women so it makes sense that they wouldn't put a "why women cheat" in a magazine leaning towards women readers. I once read an article that described women having affairs and how they felt afterward, but I rarely see those type of columns.|`|bAY9j21Paa	because women are better liars... we can hide our cheating a lot better.. so therefore society doesn't think we do it as much. I truly whole heatedly believe women cheat more than men. men are just stupid and go on dating sites and stuff and get caught alot more.|`|PbwCVPL1aa	women cheat just as much as a man. They just don't pit it out there in the open. Most men won't admit it when his wife is cheating cuz they don't want to believe it.|`|bIimm8fSaa	Women are better at hiding it.  Better at lying about it.  You do have a good question though.  As many women cheat as men and it should be addressed.|`|sy7K3m7taa	women are paranoid and always want to find answers for why men cheat so that they can stop it happening, maybe men care less or just don't think about it that's why there are no articles.|`|kK4vYqXPaa	NOT all men cheat !!|`|bqkfu6Diaa	No one wants to read about whores. It's more fun to see them in action.|`|jBigEy0Caa	Maybe you should write one?|`|U3RCBmKJaa	yea im a married but seperated woman from my husband almost a year and i dont know how many times i cheated im trying to change but the men get cought cheating more then the women do thats prob why men trust their partner way to much and well be going around your back doing it but watching every move the men make to catce him doing something at least thats what i do and know alot of females whos the same|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Because we already know why.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Men are azzholes.|`|X7rPWJU8aa	women cheat they are just sneaky about it and cover their tracks better. common ladies you know that women cheat just as much as men just don't get caught. and not every one cheats  i am just saying that on a average its a close race. so to speak|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I think there are and I have seen them.  I can recall a time 15 years ago or so when wives were being encouraged to cheat "for the good of their marriages..."  The movie Bridges Over Madison County comes to mind.<br>  <br>  By and large, society seems to have accepted the notion that women cheat when their psychological needs are not being met by their husbands.  (I find this ludicrous, because the man she's cheating with cannot meet even her security needs, which are more basic than the psychological ones.)<br>  <br>  I am seeing more and more marriages destroyed by the wife's cheating behavior, btw.  Perhaps this is because men see the wisdom of a female divorce attorney or perhaps it is our societal decline.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	There are.  I searched it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=AiVkjI4XCQzmF2TdO4LBLlxG2vAI?p=why+women+cheat&fr=my-myy&toggle=1&cop=&ei=UTF-8">http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=AiVk...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT: and I do not think it is less likely for women to cheat, I just think that women want to figure out why more than men do.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I think it's less common for women to cheat...<br>  <br>  Add:  I said it's less common - not that women don't cheat - just that it's less common for women to stray...|`|JbA7a5kGaa	Women cheat all of the time.  <br>  <br>  Its just that society wants to create this constant image of women as innocent victims.
OmRxIg8Baa	Well you should go to college....and major in business cause it opens the door to many different fields.  Im engaged currently and i feel that i would want a wedding planner to have a good knowledge of how businesses work since its a huge deal...communications and negotiations with different vendors to provide your client with the best possible product (their wedding) for a certain cost.  I would be more inclined to spend money on a college educated individual with credentials then someone who may not have that background.|`|HHB9LUqiaa	My major in college was Hospitality Administration.. and with that (and experience of course) i could be an event planner, pretty much anything to do with restaurants or hotels.. i chose hotels though :)  So yes there are courses you can take to become an event planner|`|QmvYGkNJaa	There is a course you can take to be a wedding planner, but it's rare. If you live in the UK, try ICS. I once flicked through their brochure and found this course. <br>  <br>  I looked on Google and found the following coruses available - <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=wedding+planner+course+study&meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=w...</a><br>  Just look through the list for something in your area. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, something that will stand you in good stead would be to take a course in Event Co-ordination. Being an Events Co-ordinator will give you plenty of experience to go into wedding planning.<br>  <br>  I also think that being married yourself helps you understand what the bride is going through, and you can support her more. Of course, this isn't a must; but it does help.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Definitely get a business degree...you will need that more than you realize right now
QJslTCUBaa	What is a stagette?|`|6UmRmaeWaa	karaoke in a small town bar.....everyone loves karaoke!
