20090307172603AAX4TAb	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What kind of Colleges can I get into?	I'm only a Sophomore in High School, but i've been thinking a lot about college and which ones I can get into. Currently, my average is around a 94-95 (What's that on a 4.0 scale?) I'm taking 3 honors/enriched courses this year and next year AP History, Enriched Physics and English. Senior year I will take AP Writing or Literature, AP Biology and another AP history.       I'm a member of the Italian honor society, Italian Club, I have participated in the school newspaper and will most likely be in National Honor Society senior year. In addition, I play the guitar outside of school, I'm learning the piano and I write a lot. I'm also planning on playing Tennis next year for the school team. I'd like to go to school to double major in Journalism and Creative Writing.       Based on this, what kind of schools could I get into? My dream would be NYU, is this possible? Or maybe Boston University? Could I possibly get into schools like these or maybe even better?       Also, what can I do to better improve my chances of getting into these schools? Also, assuming my SAT scores will be great as i'm taking review classes and will continue to and my essay is amazing.       Btw, I live in New York and would like to go to a school in a major city with plenty of resources and internships available. I'm pretty open to suggestions as well.        Thanks so much.

20090307173753AA5BM2j	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Graduate in languages and literature, here in Brazil, became sufficient to try enter to Oxford University?	Because, I saw in Oxford website, that:         The Certificado de Ensino Medio or University entrance examination (Vestibular, ENEM, PAS) would not be sufficient for candidates to make a competitive application. So below the page say that:      If your qualification is listed above as being insufficient to make a competitive application to Oxford University then we would strongly recommend that you undertake further study if you wish to apply.  You might want to consider taking A-Levels or another equivalent, such as the International Baccalaureate (IB). We would be looking for AAA at A-Level, or a level of performance around 38-40, including core points, with 6s or 7s in the higher subjects in the IB.  For further information about institutions offering these qualifications in your country, you may wish to contact your local British Council (www.britishcouncil.org) or the International Baccalaureate Organisation (www.ibo.org).      The first year of a Bachelors degree from another university could also be an acceptable alternative.      OK... If I'll go graduate in languages and literature, that we call here LETRAS... I can try enter to Oxford University?      If, had things wrong in my ask, it's because I'm learn english yet!      Thank's a lot everybody!

What question do you think will be easier to do and what should I put as my three main points?      1. Elie Wiesel was correct to call his memoir "Night" for it shows the dark side of humanity all too clearly. Discuss.      2. The dehumanising atrocities perpetrated upon Elie make him less of a human being. Do you agree?      3. "Night" can be described as a journey from innocence to experience. Discuss.      4. "Night" is structured so that each chapter is more horrifying than then the last, with no happy ending. What effect does this structure have upon the reader?      thank you so much   10 points to the best :)

20070324194420AAuE1wT	Education & Reference;Teaching	Where can I find good teaching jobs without having to get certified in different states and retain my benefits	I retired from Texas public school teaching this year, but I need to re-enter the teaching field full time.   I can't teach in the public school system unless I lay out a year of teaching (subbing) and then only in a teacher shortage area.  Private schools generally don't make the larger salary as public schools and I need the finances.  I'm thinking about teaching on a military base and/or overseas.  Perhaps even teaching in our prison systems.  I would appreciate any information you would have to offer.
