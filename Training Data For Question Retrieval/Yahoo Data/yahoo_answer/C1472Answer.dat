AA11922696	actually the west labeled "terrorists" at every Islamic movement that achieved success and was close to rule, or ruled.    the main point is to prevent them from ruling, even if they do, they will be obliged to leave it under the pressure of the international and regional opposition, just as what happened with Hamas in Palestine and with the Islamic Courts in Somalia, and in Algeria.

sn5334Kqaa	Well the words we use and how we use them is a decent meter of intelligence.  Particularly on first impressions, the way a person speaks is a large part of how others will see them.  For instance if someone is too stupid to properly pronounce a three letter word such as "ask" in the only language they have ever been exposed to you can fairly conclude that person is an idiot or has a speech impediment, usually the former is the case.  Language choices are a very important part of who we are.|`|5zhgaiW9aa	You mean curse words?

It is a shame you can't share that statement and he be decent about it.  It your treat and you like it and he shouldn't have ANYTHING to say about it except I am proud you did good.      As for being oversensitive...I think you are overreacting to what he said and just say...ok and do what you want anyways.      I would talk to him about his attitude though...that type of attitude is going to cause you two to have communication problems.  If you get to where you don't want to deal with something you will quit talking to him and one thing after another and soon you won't be talking for fear of another statement from him.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	It is a hallmark of control freaks and abusive types that they will say something mean, then accuse you of being "too sensitive" when you object.  That in itself is an effort at controlling you. Your reply was sensible and to the point, certainly not offensive in any way - it's one piece, you like it, and you are rewarding yourself for a job well done.  If this is a pattern of his and not an isolated incident,  consider whether you want to continue to be with someone who tries to control you like this and who disregards your thoughts and feelings.|`|VMY7No0eaa	DIET.= super sensitive to others eating what they want..

If you want a piece of pizza then go ahead and get one. Sounds like he's being sensitive, you tell him you want the pizza regardless of what he syas and he starts insulting you.    He's just justifying himself and being overdefensive. Eat your pizza.|`|TPTpwarwaa	First off, don't let anyone bring you down!  I'm very sensitive myself, but i just don't let people get the best of me. That's what most people want (even boyfriends) is to bring you down and feel low.   If he makes you feel this way and snap at you for no reason more than you'd like him to, he doesn't sound like the type of guy you want-i mean he should treat you like a princess always!  And ONE slice of pizza? I mean come on lol he sounds like he just snapped at you because he's crabby about his new diet and he's not getting enough fats in his diet. You should be able to eat whatever YOU want, not whatever he wants!  If he snaps at you for that, i would really say what's on your mind. But instead of saying ouch, say are you serious?! You're giving me a bad attitude over a flipping piece of pizza? Wow..  Lol that's what i would say!  Does he tell you you're oversensitive a lot? If so, screw him! I'm oversensitive, a lot of people are|`|ORluWHGAaa	wow .. he is not really understanding a all. he doesn't like pizza doesn't mean you can't have one too. and I think you deserve to have one. you have to seriously talk to him about the problem i know i know its nothing huge but bf is not suppose to put you down but to support you.|`|Irr5ftN7aa	Your boyfriend should be supportive of you, not judgmental and condescending. And in any relationship, you should feel comfortable enough to have open communication, and if you are thinking about "never telling him anything" to prevent this type of reaction from happening, you might want to reconsider why you are with this tool in the first place.    I just ate two pieces of pizza, and actually I kind of want a third. You can eat whatever you want, and treat yourself as often as you want... It's your body, so you must be happy with it first and foremost. Once you have self-confidence, you will be less inclined to associate yourself around people that insult you because they need an ego boost. It is not his place to tell you how to reward yourself. But I think you would be doing yourself a favor by getting rid of this guy.    And, pizza does have nutritional value believe it or not!! Cheese has calcium, if you have whole wheat crust that adds fiber, and tomato sauce is loaded with anti-oxidants. I'm not saying to make a diet of it, but it's not like you just stuffed your face with four big macs!!!    You're not oversensitive.... he is putting you down to feel better about himself. Stand up for yourself!!!!|`|rThIVk2maa	Do you habitually allow other people to tell you what it is you are feeling and thinking, regardless of what you really feel and think? That is controlling behavior and not to be tolerated, it is not his job to mediate what you eat or tell you how to behave.|`|7EPLQzueaa	He sounds like a control freak.|`|RjttUTE0aa	ignore them , do your job better then them, show them how well liked you are by your co workers|`|YnG0Tjxjaa	Sounds like he's just jealous and cranky on his new diet. I don't think you're too sensitive. I'd stand up for myself and say something too. People are probably trying to tell you that you're oversensitive because they don't like the the way you react to some of their negative things that they have said/done. Just keep up what you're doing and stand up for what you believe and keep speaking up if something's bothering you. Don't let people run all over you saying you're oversensitive.|`|8Tmcg67iaa	You are not too senstive, it sounds like your boyfriend cannot keep quiet.  If you want a piece of pizza...have a piece of pizza!  Nothing more needs to be said.  If he wants to give you good health tips, that is fine.  But then if you choose to ignore that tip and have pizza, he needs to shut up.  If you sense your boyfriend is mean...he is.  Mean, manipulative men ALWAYS have a reason for their behavior.  Find someone who is nice to you or expect to be miserable and questioning everything about "you" for the rest of your life with him.|`|ZtaiHC6laa	Well he is on a diet so he probably wants you to not tempt him. But he sounds like a retard if he has to "educate" you for something that you knew already and made a good decision to be moderate.|`|038b3db0c6731c85bcf4ffeef2198715aa	Your boyfriend is the one who is oversensitive because he's the one who's making a big deal about a slice of pizza.|`|1TQTw2bnaa	Yes. Words like that are used to silence women - like the word 'nag' is. He's being a jerk and frankly, do you tell HIM what to eat? Didn't think so.    Pizza isn't horrible for you, either. I make organic pizza with whole grain crust and hormone-free cheese, and it's great (thank Trader Joes!).

AA12350023	I would call them out on it..  Id probably go up and say something to the effect of what you said here..   "hey, brother so and so, Ive noticed that no one here in this masjid seems to help me, who can I talk to, to feel a part of this group. I know im new, is there a member that I should be referred to being new".. or whatever you feel you want to say, but Id definately tell them that you want more from them and who should you talk to, they probably dont even realize they are alienating you.. you might be their wakeup call... (and if you get your foot in the door, why dont you take up the task of welcoming commitee and help the new comers after you)|`|ILc1XIPraa	Brother you should go to a different masjid, or talk to a brother you know and find out what the deal is. It does look really bad they don't want to help you and it's totally against islam . I have never heard of such a thing, and it's really sad. If there's an islamic book store in your area go there and talk to them , I find these people very nice and educated. They are tied into the community and have lot's of information available. You have made an effort and insha'Allah will be rewarded for that, but keep at it. There's always another masjid. Salamu Alaikom.    ** Mintee makes a great point. I myself am not quite so bold , but if you are please do it . They should hear it from you .|`|AA11922696	as I said, yo are praying for God not for them. so you shouldn't stop going to pray in the mosque because you felt that you are not welcomed there.    this is Allah's house, not the house of anyone else, even the Imam.    @Edit  indeed Allah is ever where, but why should you quit going to the mosque because of such reason?    so, whenever you face difficulties in your life, you run and hide instead of facing them and deal with them.    ofcourse it is up to you, I only can give you my opinion and Allah knows best ofcourse.
PyOCZiwjaa	nope, it's wrong.    she hasn't eaten hardly at all doesn't make sense.  hasn't and hardly don't work together.  you could say "She hasn't eaten at Burger King at all."  This means she NEVER ever ate there.    or "She has hardly eaten at Burger King at all."  means she's eaten there hardly = VERY few times  it's a bit stronger than the next example    which is "She has hardly eaten at Burger King"  which could also mean that she was there a lot, but she didn't eat there|`|m7r0nOFEaa	No it is not correct.  You can use either of the following though.    She does not eat at Burger King that often or hardly has been.

xotehoBlaa	1. There are roughly 4 sects in Shia Islam: Twelvers (Ithnata 'ashar), Isma'ili, Zaidi, and 'Alawi. The Twelvers sect is the largest sect within Shia Islam and latter sects are viewed to have branched off from it.     2. It depends on which sect of Shia Muslims you are referring to. Within the predominant Shia sect (Twelvers), the school of thought is Ja'fariyyah.    3. Quite different in terms of the Imamate (which are considered Imams) and interpretation. Nothing else comes into mind as of now.    4. The Ja'fariyyah school of thought, followed by the majority: The Twelvers.
AA11922696	as Muslims, we should believe in this because it is in the Holy Quran.    Jews and Christians believe in Mosses, Ibrahim and the other prophets peace be upon them all, God.  even if Jews don't believe in Jesus peace be upon him.    we as Muslims, believe in all the prophets and we believe that they were sent by the same God, and this God sent Mohamed peace be upon him as the final prophet.    even if the Christians and the Jews think that they have different God, this wont be our problem.

But if you ask a Christian, s/he will say no- only they and the Jews worship God while Muslims do not.    Christians are the odd ones out.|`|0yTM98Odaa	Christians and Jews do.  However the god talked about in Islam is not our God at all.  Most Christians believe Mohammad was visited by something demonic or even satan himself so the Quran is not from our God and so they are worshiping something demonic.|`|vnty8yOgaa	Yes    Only ONE God for all|`|C9KWIb5Saa	Not really. The Jewish "God" rested on the 7th day. And the Christian's "God" is a blonde-hair blue-eyed white guy.|`|VGsSxgvjaa	Peace  Yes, we pray to the same God. One and only. I'm Muslim by the way. We are call the monotheistic religions for the same reason. Only that Muslims believe that the other two great religions had their Scriptures altered by the hand of man, thus invalidating as a code of conduct for the whole of humanity. Whereas for Islam, the word of God has been kept intact, unaltered and will remain so. We believe in all the other Prophets (Pbut), from Adam to Muhammad (saw). The word Allah in arabic means "the One Unique". The proper name of God, never been used before in creation to designate anything.|`|AA10405801	No, they don't.  This is especially true for Christians who worship 3 gods!|`|AH1LuqZMaa	Yes all three abrahamic religions all come from the same roots.  The Jews call God Yweh, and the Muslims call God Allah. Allah is an Arabic word for God, and even the arab Christians call God Allah.|`|O1Sqcc5yaa	No.  The god in the Old Testament (Jews) has different properties than the god in the New Testament (Christians) and both of them are very different from the god in the Koran (Muslims).  Many people like to say they all worship the same god, but it's not true.    Take Christians and Jews.  The Christian god had a son (Jesus) and he was the Messiah.  The Jewish god, however, never had a son and furthermore, according to Jews the Messiah has not come yet.    As much as people like to believe that all of these three religions have the "same" god, it's simply not true.|`|ILc1XIPraa	It depends on who you ask . Muslims absolutely believe we all have the same One God,  Putting aside the false believes of christians of course (the  theory of the trinity). That just isn't something that jives with Judaism or Islam. Until then we were all on the same page.|`|AA11132696	NOOO HONEY read the internet dont ask peopleyou ll go crazy.Look dear .    Christians we worship JESUS CHRIST  Muslims they worship OTHER GOD CALLED ALLAH which is NOT THE SAME NEVER WILL BE .  Jews worship Jesus too  simple dear you got it all now!!|`|mkT0PQ4Paa	That depends...Muslims worship only one God; Allah, whose shape, form and being we have no knowledge/image of as He is like nothing He has created, including us, and He is unique. He did not beget nor was he begotten. Now some Christians consider Jesus as being one third of the being of God, along with the holy ghost and then God. So they consider God as being composed of 3 parts, one of which is human, which died on a cross, so from this I would say NO. A lot of Jews believe Ezra was the son of God. Unitarian Christians and Jews who do not believe Jesus and Ezra were sons of God and who believe they were only prophets, and who believe God is unlike anything we could ever imagine, maybe. But if they believe God has any attributes that are human, such as the fact that he needed rest after creating the heavens and the earth, then I would say again that it is debatable, as muslims do not believe He has any human attributes or ones that make Him anything less than perfect. Allah knows best.|`|UhyvM73iaa	I know Muslims and Jews worship the same God.  If Christians   worship Jesus Christ as God, then off course they are not worshipping the same God.  They worship Jesus because they think God is in Jesus because he did some miracles.  They do mean to wroship God thinking God is in Jesus.     Truth is that Jewish priests in power would not accept any Prophet.   They had already killed two Prophets of God Zakariah and John the Baptists (May God be pleased with them).  So God did lots of   miracles with the hands of Jesus, so Jews have no excuse for rejecting Jesus as Prophet of God. A good number of Jews turned Christians mistakenly believing that  God has incarnated in Jesus.   Fact is that if God incarnetes into His Prophets than why He did not incarnate in  Prophets before and after Jesus.  Prophet Moses and Mohammad SAW  did miracles but God gave Jesus more miracles than all other Prophets  to make a case against Jews.   God also gave him power to heal because there were too many sick people and Jewish soceity did not care for them. So God gave power to heal to cure these people and to show that He must be man of God.  Lots of early Christians were true believer of God and to them Jesus Christ was a Prophet of God and not a God.  If God has incarnated in Jesus then why Jesus used to worship God (whom he called Father in spiritual sense only).   These were the true followers of Jesus whom Romans used to hunt and kill them.  Concept of Trinity in Catholicism was there but these true Christians who believed in one God were hunted and killed because they would not believe in Trinity.  You must know early Popes in Europe killed lots of Protestants who separated from Catholic Church  because they wouldn't believe on Trinity.    Lots of Christians and even Christians priests are realizing now that their belief has been not correct and they are reverting to Islam and one and only God almighty that Muslims and Jews worship.|`|QcviYozHaa	Peace...    Some christians believe Jesus is God, and thus worship him...Most Christians worship the trinity which is the 3 Gods as they dont think of son when they think of father, they dont think of holy ghost when they think of son...So they have 3 mental pictures in their head..    Muslims and Jews worship the Same God and True God...Whereas the Christians worship a man ( a prophet of god) unfortunately..    The 3 religions all recieved the revelation but man changed many parts of the christian scripture for their benefit and the Torah was corrupted or lost after Babylon..Islam has remained the same and will always stay the same (as it is memorised by millions around the world)..    Peace|`|4926be50d60aa020f0fcd455ac2541abaa	Christians and Jews worship YHWH, Muslims worship Allah, are they the same? Maybe, but I believe it is a case of mistaken identity on the part of Muslims.      "A lot" of Jews DO NOT believe Ezra is/was the son of god, that's another thing the quran got wrong/made up.

Black kids say it to their white (or black) friends, Hispanics say it to their black friends, white guys say it to their black friends etc...  I think people are just trying to change the word from its original meaning (which meant something offensive) to establish a better meaning that means close friendship and brotherhood.

Why? because it causes offense. That is reason enough to not say it. Besides, in WHAT conversation would you ever have need to use such a word?|`|Irr5ftN7aa	I could probably write 50 pages on this, but my short answer is absolutely not.... it is not right to say the N-word.     But I never give short answers to anything it seems....    As much as I wish it would disappear from the vernacular altogether, if African Americans choose to call each other the word (with clear slavery connotations... the N-word dates back to the word Negro which was used during slavery), then so be it. However, it is never too well-received when a person from another race calls an African American the N-word.     However, there needs to be a top-down, "Stop the N-Word" commitment by record execs and producers to get this word out of rap music. Perhaps eventually, it will be waned out of people's vocabulary.     Unfortunately, when something leaves, it is almost always replaced with something else.... the only way to really get rid of the "N-Word" is to get rid of the "old hatreds" as Obama states, because our "patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness."         I|`|y2nC8BUGaa	in rap songs they use the term ending in an 'a' instead of 'er' which is ok to them because it's just slang not meant to hurt anyone.

I think you are very ignorant for saying that you have the right to say "anything no matter what."  That's not what freedom of speech is.  Can you scream "fire" in a crowded room without getting in trouble? I don't think so.  Can you bear false witness without getting in trouble? I don't think so.  You cannot libel or slander someone without getting in trouble.  You cannot say whatever you want.  Freedom of speech and all other freedoms operate on the premise of the common good.  It is not in the interest of the common good to go around calling people offensive names.  So no you should not say that word.|`|QtwHdlN7aa	Well its not nice for white people or black people or anyone to say it. I was reading a book about racism and the Caucasian guy called a African American the N- word and it was really hurtfull to her.|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	No. It's never right.

SaQ5d420aa	You sound young.  Youth is a time to explore and get a an idea of how you feel about yourself and who you want in your life.    Please note: I am not suggesting what your sexual orientation is now, or what it will be years to come.  That will be based on who, man or woman, you are turned on by.  What you like to do with your body can be done with both sexes ... almost everything that is.    Exploring your sexual turn ons is fun -- at any age.  What you like now may not be to your liking later on.  What turns you are now seems to be seeing the "naughty" happenings on your screen.  Maybe straight sex is too "normal" for you to get excited.  Nothing wrong with that.  Straight guys quite often get turned on by a three-way: with two women and just one guy.  Never with 2 guys and 1 woman.  But I probably should not have said never.    See? Variety is what you and most people want.  The missionary position is boring after seven years with the same woman/wife.  That is what is meant by the 'seven year itch.'  Without variety everyone want to find someone else to scratch their itchy sexual apparatus.    As for playing with your as*h*le:  you have not explored that very well.  Most straight guys will agree that they are afraid of what they will find there and will be feminized if they do like being touched there.  However, Nature gave us men a wonderful, sensitive spot buried a bit deeper into the anus. (for some guys it is about a thumbs length past the anal lips.)  It is called the prostate.  It is located between the rectum wall and your pubic hair.  Massaging that with or without a partner leads to intense sexual release and pleasure that will blow your mind.   At least that is how it is with me for many years.    The Chinese put special knots on a silk scarf and insert almost the whole scarf into the anus.  At just the right moment, the scarf is pulled out quickly.  You will have to experiment to find out what your 'special' moment is.   See the web sites below for a couple of suggestions for substituting the silk scarf and finding your prostate.    Have fun.  Enjoy being young.  Give yourself lots of time and get lots of experiences before you close the door on anything for the rest of your life.

fdU4rJXCaa	Yes, I believe we should legalize outdoor nudity...it should be one of our protected freedoms. The government should not dictate to us how much clothing we should wear...we should have the option of wearing clothing or not depending on our comfort.  There are already places where outdoor nudity is legal (such as the beach I frequent) and in some States/countries women are free to wear no top any place men can do so. Society is getting more used to less clothing, and we should take the next logical step...allowing people to have the option of not wearing clothing in public places.|`|576e76ca46b6c4293f45926a8e75773caa	I'm with Brad.

Ontop of that, I think it could go badly simply because in our current society, nudity IS sexualized (which I agree that sexualizing all nudity is rather foolish), and it would cause many problems with  perverts. Imagine all the pictures that would be taken, how much privacy would be invaded.     I love being naked. I do not think that nudity automatically equally sex, I am comfortable being naked.. How ever, I would feel violated if some one took my picture while I was naked and, say, put it online.
fdU4rJXCaa	Yes, I do think people should be able to be publicly nude. I don't think that the government should dictate to us how much, if any, clothing should be worn.  There are already public places where one can be nude (like the nude beach), and this should be expanded to allow public nudity everywhere. Clothing should be optional in all public places.|`|GrqsnWtiaa	No, i dont want to see fat naked chicks and grannies with saggy ****|`|7zVvAzJCaa	God damn it!  Yes I do!    Why?

Considering previous generations before +2 have died of old age.    Considering that our model is very simplified and a real woman is able to have children from age 14 to 50, we see that 6.6B is a really small number.    1.08^N is number of women born in Nth generation, not the sum of all women in all generations.

Just go backwards.. 6.7 billion people now, in only 1900 the world population was only 1.6 billion!! 1800 less than 1 billion. It doesn't take a genius to figure out it will be near zero 6000 year ago.    Bible chronology points to the creation of Adam about 6000 years ago. I know you want that to be hard to believe, but the HISTORY of the world only goes back about 5 - 6000 years, that it. So whenever you hear even something happening 7500 years ago... that's PRE-historic, basically only a guess.    We see the population keeps growning, so if you go backwards pretty soon logic tells you it's down to just two. Just like scripture says.    BTW: To be clear - THE EARTH is probably BILLIONS of years old, as science teaches, and true Christians understand. The very first verse of the bible says 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth' indeed that was likely billions of years ago.

bn0oXqDcaa	Hmmm hard question, i've never come across any ayaat that talks about feeling sorry for yourself, but i do not giving up on Allah swt and his power to take one out of a situation is WRONG and can take one to kufr (Allahu 3'lam) but yeah we need to be strong and have Trust in ALLAH. If we feel sorry for ourself doesn't that say that we believe there's no way out? when in fact if Allah brings you to it, He (swt) can also bring you through it ;)     Dua, Faith and Strength is the answer.

ZaVPaDGhaa	oh sweetheart, you are so normal even though you dont feel like it right now. And no, you are not to young to be having these feelings. you are exactally the age that a persons sexuality begins to unfold.  Do you live in a big city by any chance? If so, there will be an LGBT group for young people, which will be an excellent place for you to go to meet other people just like you. I know it sounds weird, but getting to know other people with the same issues will help you deal with your own friends and other issues in your life.  I remember feeling exactally like you did when i was your age and i was terrified, and people were total assholes in school. I wouldnt tell too many people yet. People that age are not mature enough to handle it well. I am not saying you should be ashamed and go into hiding, but i am saying that it is an ingnorant and sometime hateful world towards different people, so protect yourself.  Check this website - it might help you find a group near you. And no one even has to know you are going to it. Just say your going to the library.    http://www.lgbtcenters.org/site/PageServ...    By the way, are your parents cool? If they arent fundamentalist christians or something, they should accept you. You are their child after all. It can help to have them in your corner. Trust me, it will get better.  Be strong, proud, SAFE, and yourself. You are beautiful  good luck sister    Ewwww, dont listen to Jeffrey about finding a man. That is bullshit. If you like guys, fine, but dont go find one just because it will make life easier. That is the worst, most homophobic advice ever.|`|52VDjbNTaa	You're most probably going through a phase.

But your friends/family/school shouldn't judge you and you should always just be yourself, whatever that may mean to you.|`|TOljxMLMaa	Just really be sure before you tell people about this.

It's a bad idea to just bottle up your feelings but i wouldn't tell other pupils at your school. Maybe you should speak to somebody eg. yor parents or a school counciller. If you live in the U.K maybe you should call childline for free on 0800 1111 and talk about it. Hope this helps and good luck :).|`|G8IRX295aa	counseling. you know life is confusing, but without some confusing part would we have life? We are never sure about things, so we get confused.

First of all assure your friends that you do not think of them that way.  Second it is natural at your age to be wondering about your sexuality.  There are attractive aspects to all people, guys and girls both.  While I personally am strongly heterosexual I understand that there are people who prefer otherwise.  Try flirting with or generally showing interest in the men first, that way you will avoid any tormenting or bullying by other people in your school.  Hopefully you will find a nice man who will treat you well and you won't have to worry about this again.

This doesn't necessarily mean that God endorses the war in Iraq. Jesus willingly gave his life up on the cross for the sake of mankind, but this doesn't mean that God endorsed the murder of the only innocent man ever to have lived.    God has judged Saddam Hussein, and he will judge George W. Bush; he will judge me, and he's going to judge you. America, Iraq and Israel/Palestine might none of them be the promised land, but we all as individuals need to make sure we side with God before we get what we deserve, and that means worshipping, loving and serving him for his love to us revealed in Christ, and the promise of a land, a new creation that is free from war.|`|fGPNFnikaa	HECK NO|`|PEk1K6qqaa	Bible says blessed are the peacemakers, not warmongers.|`|Mm18SDwVaa	Dear friends,Lets me start by saying YES i do believe in God .There is only ONE GOD but gods and Muhammad(pbuh) is the last messanger of God .Now, in any religion war is not allowed for your personnal interests that include war against muslim against muslims or non muslims ,non muslims against non muslims or muslims.The only one way war is imposed on you if you are forced to follow the false Gods and or to protect the glory of God against the false gods.period.  If some stupid genious fly planes into the buildings and kills innocents and then claim that it was in the name of God is absolutly wrong and God do not allow that .same thing you dont have right to go in some ones else house to impose a war on them and claim that we are helpeing them from some dictator, unless the people living under that dectator rule ask for help .So to me war is not cool war is never cool .It is the destruction of humanity.Read about the lives of all the prophets from Moses(pbuh) to Muhammad(pbuh) They picked up the sword only when all the possibilities were utilities and failed.God bless you all.Thanks|`|cGULgr1caa	I found this when using google to find verses to answer this question and i could not have had a better answer for you .      Many people make the mistake of believing the Bible says, You shall not kill, and seek to apply this command to war. However, the Bible actually says, You shall not murder (Exodus 20:13). The Hebrew word literally means the intentional, premeditated killing of another person with malice. God often ordered the Israelites to go to war with other nations (1 Samuel 15:3; Joshua 4:13). God ordered the death penalty for numerous crimes (Exodus 21:12; 21:15; 22:19; Leviticus 20:11). So, God is not against killing in all circumstances, but rather only murder. War is never a good thing, but sometimes it is a necessary thing. In a world filled with sinful people (Romans 3:10-18), war is inevitable. Sometimes the only way to keep sinful people from doing great harm to the innocent is by going to war with them.1 Samuel 15:18 says, Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; make war on them until you have wiped them out. So, obviously God is not against all war. Jesus is always in perfect agreement with the Father (John 10:30), so we cannot argue that war was only Gods will in the Old Testament. God does not change (Malachi 3:6; James 1:17).  Jesus second coming will be exceedingly violent. Revelation 19:11-21 describes the ultimate war with Christ the conquering commander who judges and makes war, but with justice (v. 11). Its going to be bloody (v. 13) and gory. The birds will eat the flesh of all those who oppose Him (v. 17-18). He has no compassion upon His enemies who He will conquer completely, and He consigns them to a fiery lake of burning sulfur (v. 20).    It is an error to say that God never supports a war. Jesus is not a pacifist. In a world filled with evil people, sometimes a war is necessary to prevent even greater evil. If Hitler had not been defeated by World War II, how many more millions would have been killed? If the Civil War had not been fought, how much longer would African-Americans have had to suffer as slaves? We must all remember to base our beliefs of the Bible, not on our emotions (2 Timothy 3:16-17).
rFFYCmOGaa	Ancient texts refer to the soul as a reference to what we would call "mind."    And you are correct, taken in that context, at death the brain dies and so does the "soul."    Some believe that you can become "enlightened" or "reborn" during their lifetime and when they say this they are referring to the birth, igniting, or  "quickening" of the "spirit" which is an ethereal or energy based form similar to the body but made out of energy which persists beyond death since it's life is not physically based.    Not all religious people agree on this however.|`|JCGtfNeTaa	I agree with you that there are no ghosts (disembodied souls). There is no such thing as a disembodied soul, and we do not go to heaven (or hell) upon death, according to the Bible.    According to the Bible, we do not HAVE souls; we ARE souls.    Consider the creation of mankind:    Genesis 2:7  And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.    Notice that man was not *given* a soul, but that he *BECAME* a living soul.    A soul, according to the Bible, is a body with the Breath of Life in it.      The Bible even calls animals souls.    Revelation 16:3  And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.      The Bible says that in death itself, mankind has no advantage over animals:    Ecclesiastes 3:18-21  I said in my heart, Concerning the condition of the sons of men, God tests them, that they may see that they themselves are like animals. For what happens to the sons of men also happens to animals; one thing befalls them: as one dies, so dies the other. Surely, they all have one breath; man has no advantage over animals, for all is vanity. All go to one place: all are from the dust, and all return to dust. Who knows the spirit of the sons of men, which goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, which goes down to the earth?    God did not give us souls, but we ARE SOULS.    Furthermore, souls are not immortal. For it is written:    Ezekiel 18:4 - the soul that sinneth, it shall die.    Only God is immortal:    1 Timothy 6:15-16  He who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 16 who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whom be honor and everlasting power.      We are not immortal, as many may claim, but we will receive immortality at Christ's second coming. If we are already immortal, then we would not need to receive immortality at the second coming; but the fact is, we are NOT immortal.    1 Corinthians 15:51-54  Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality|`|iNn9mmOtaa	try to see the allegory, to get it: understanding    1Corinthians 15:  Adam1 was a living "soul"; but as in Adam all die.  Adam2 is a quickening spirit; but as in Adam all die.  So then move on to Christ in whom all are made alive.    Hebrews 4:  The word of God divides asunder soul(law) and spirit(law),  but also divides asunder joints(laws) and marrow(grace),  and notably in order to get to the heart of the matter...    if your heart is not established with grace,  but rather established with laws (profit nothing),   your heart will condemn(law) you also with your own mouth  Job 15:6... Mt 15:11... Mk 7:20-22... Rom 2:1... Heb 13:9...|`|R0mZqqfXaa	I agree.|`|61a1bb75a10bf426d979acfca18b8d63aa	You already know the beliefs of other people and you know the christian belief to that question. You however have made up your mind and we refuse to listen to truth. I promise you that you will get your answer in time. "It is appointed to all once to die, and then the judgement".|`|AA10410743	A soul is the union of the body and the spirit.     A persons spirit looks just like the person, but it is not physical in form.     Sentience. Humm, well, I'm not too sure you would say that it has a seperate sentience from the body, but it is part of the body. The physical brain and the spirit brain for THE brain - if that makes any sense. Ideally, the spirit and the body work hand in hand to do what needs to be done to return to God. However, that isn't always the way things work in mortality. In mortality the body can easily take charge and ignore the spirit - making the spirits job more difficult, but not impossible.   At what point does the spirit come about? Good question - the debate rages on. At what point does life begin? At what point does a clump of cells turn into human life? If a clump of cells will eventually turn into human life, does that mean that clump of cells needs to be protected so that it can transform into human life? If so, does that mean that life begins at conception? All of these and countless other questions are debated every moment of the day - on here, and in the real world.     I think animals have a spirit.     The point of our weak bodies is to see if we will master them, to give us experience that can only be given when we understand human frailties and mortality, and to fulfill a commandment of God - He wants us to choose Him and His ways and has said that in order to do so, one of the first steps is to have a physical body.|`|500b0fe5bfd90198931c2235e47b33efaa	The body is the "world-consciousness," the soul is the "self-consciousness," and the spirit is the "God-consciousness."  The soul is the meeting point; here the spirit and the body join.    Check out http://www.jayzuv.com/nee.html for more.

We were put on the Earth to live out our lives to the fullest of our abilities, and then eventually die, regardless of how well we did. In that sense, there is no point at all, if you don't believe in souls.  I, however, DO believe in souls, and that our bodies are just vessels. The spirit is what attaches the soul to the body, and when our body decays, the spirit crumbles right along with it. Our souls have to go somewhere, so they take shelter in the next available body they can find. Process repeats, and life goes on. So... still no point, I guess.

plOBKNy4aa	Gay isn't something that should freak you out.  I am straight, but I have never been freaked out by homosexuality.

In my honest opinion, i think you're just accepting the fact about 'homosexual' things. As you said, it doesn't bother you... that means you've accepted it..|`|S63ovAuZaa	look being gay is having female Harmon instead of your normal male Harmon but the thing few people know that we all have both Harmon in our bodies but in boys case male Harmon r like 90% of our Harmon and the rest is female Harmon, so don't freak out stay calm, u r not gay but u r thinking too much of your 10% of female Harmon, its normal we all got some.|`|xzl9njBXaa	your gay and your into denying it.Find a gay man and check your responses to him.You might find your answer when he tries to check you.
bLahP9Ivaa	The gentleman who speaks of crude oil, gold an extreme cold obviousl knows nothing about Iceland. We have no known oil or gold, and New York gets colder in the winter than Reykjavik.  How about making little icelandic flags?|`|nisfxpXHaa	How about your countries flag, coat of arms, and Elves.

tlUihEOvaa	Maybe if I was in the mood or depends how dangerous the attacker is. <br>  <br>  If I help him/her perhaps that will change their views of my race.|`|wTqid2ONaa	I'm not sure.  If it was cuz of them saying/doing something racist i would probably watch lol.  If they were getting robbed or something like that i would help.  Sometimes little gestures can change people's minds.<br>  <br>  Edit:  It's just a matter of principle.  If you're bold enough to offend then take what you got coming to you.  I think most people in life get what they deserve one way or another.<br>  <br>  Now if somebody is being harmed through no fault of their own it's your responsibility as a human being to help that person.<br>  <br>  I forget the quote but it went something like the greatest evil is when good people do nothing to stop bad things from happening.|`|sIqXCXoVaa	I'm not Satan so yes|`|S6MqrWdjaa	no but i would watch and think to myself how they had it coming...|`|HimBbU6caa	Absolutely, because the type of "racism" that people throw around these days has no affect on me. People use this word too loosely. How does some random person who doesn't like black people stop my world from spinning? I think people need to learn what true racism is. Some ignorant idiot hating me because I am black is not stopping my direct bank deposits every week. I'd at least call the cops.|`|Gr5CAAKiaa	yeah i would. i'll try and help but i doubt i would be of any help because i'm weak. lol. i'd call the cops. verbally abuse idk. one time my asian teacher was experience verbal racism, but i didn't do anything. sucks right?? b/c i'm the only asian in that class anyway [and yes, it wasn't honors/ap. hahaha, get the joke?]|`|da4zS4AOaa	I would honestly not go there and help him. But try to tell the people beating him up to stop cause they're hurting him. Yeah he deserved it but I don't want to see him hurt badly! :(|`|aGOBuJtKaa	Depends on if the racist person threw the first punch.|`|QxvEavEjaa	I may, just to show them up|`|VG2X9Ihkaa	It depends really.  If it is one to one (any race), then I probably will call the police before helping the other person.  If there are more then one person beating someone up (of any race), I would just call the police but will wait to give evidence.<br>  <br>  It depends on the law of the country, e.g. you can self defence in Scotland but you cant do that in England or Wales, if memory serves me right.|`|b91d5a63816ce3a9cce952ee2d7b3cf6aa	maybe|`|pfke6Jieaa	if i saw a middle eastern guy/girl getting beat up by someone other than my race, and the reason is racial differences then yes i would deffinitely step in and do something about it. and yes i would be on the middle eastern person's side. but i would not let anyone talk bad about my culture anyway. im proud of who i am and if i let someone walk all over me i will never get respect. <br>  <br>  i actually have been in the situation where a middle eastern girl was being attacked by 3 girls (i aint gonna mention the race of those girls) but she was obviously helpless and i just ran there and pulled the middle eastern girl apart and stood over the other girls (im 6'3 ft and they were like 5'3 or so) and all of them left and just kept calling us terrorists and crap like that. that girl is my friend now and she is about 5'10 ft now so i doubt any of those girls will mess with her again.....lol. i hope not.|`|PbFL8jh2aa	I'm weak, so I'd stay out of it if I could, but much of it depends on the situation. If the racist person was getting beaten up because he/she displayed racism, then I'd be secretly happy, unless they end up seriously injured or almost dead, then I'd be kinda freaked.<br>  <br>  But racism pisses me off real bad.|`|kLkzBbeAaa	Sure it is just me to not be able to live with myself especially if someone is out numbered or the beating should be over, I was a lil red headed white boy in school in the mid 60's where there were about 4  black kids to one white kid and they were venting on me all the time I got to be a pretty good fighter because I would not back down and they white kids would not stick together like the black kids did  don't stand for bully's today or ever.|`|f0f91b1f61307e94f9c53fd86e2c1295aa	I guess I'd help them, though I'm not really sure. Its easy to sit in frontof a screen and say I'm not satan blah blah. But you can only know once you're in the situation. I think I'd call the cops, I wouldn't put my health on the line, except maybe if the persons death was imminent from the beating. But also on the inside I'd feel satisfaction that they got what they deserved.|`|T6NZHiRfaa	Of course.  Then again, it's difficult for anyone to say what they'll do until they're confronted with this situation.  Hopefully, you'll do the right thing!<br>  <br>  Peace, <br>  <br>  Khafre<br>  <br>  Las Vegas, NV.|`|VLRkJOOuaa	No.<br>  One less person to have to worry about.

In there mind they will realize how wrong it was to think that way.|`|J3UmD1zCaa	Yeah Im not cruel. I would probably call the cops.|`|DgsHQ47yaa	Yes. I'm not an evil person. I'd call the police.|`|ySB6dZYlaa	H_LL and No! Nothing wrong witha little beat down!|`|nEKhiuTEaa	i would call the cops|`|Dv6KSxmlaa	Yes. <br>  1. It's my duty to intervene if it occurs within Canada anyway. <br>  2.

It kind of falls into my line of work. <br>  4. I'm confident enough in my skills, abilities, and physique that I would be competent enough to help directly.|`|5ywrFCoUaa	I'd call the police. As another answer said, racism isn't what it once was; it doesn't affect you or your life and I don't think being a racist makes someone deserving of being beaten up. Everyone IS entitled to their own opinion, after all. Right?!?|`|OzE3ztR1aa	No. Im an open racist towards you orientals and if i saw one of you trying to help me i'd spit on your face. I rather take it than being helped by one of you wanna-bes.

Either be against hate or you can't really say anything against someone that hates.|`|4Vmlf902aa	I don't like to see people get beat up, so i'd probably help them.

m3YC7Jcyaa	Many health care systems work well, and the waste is internal not external.<br>  Patients should have more say not just the empolyers and employees of health care and or insurance there of.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	No problems here...for me it costs less than a hundred dollars a month to get health coverage.  <br>  <br>  It's really sad that a lot of people in this country are willing to pay $100 for a cell phone every month but then b*tch and moan that they have to pay a monthly fee for health care coverage that is normally LESS for the majority of people.<br>  <br>  <br>  Of course, I'm single, and the prices DO go up for family coverage.  But the docs and hospitals around where I live provide very good services, and I'd hate to see overcrowding the a decline of quality in service that universal health care would no doubt bring.<br>  <br>  Basically though:  Free health care is BS...nothing is FREE.  You will pay for it one way or another.<br>  <br>  We could all afford health care if the cost of living in this country wasn't so high.|`|e4QW4xvOaa	Capping drug costs and such would not be all that effective honestly, unless all the drugs became generic forms. A free market in this area would not be beneficial, just look at Wall Street, there's your free market. A government funded health care system should do the trick. We have one of the worst health care systems in the world(37th place I believe). Countries who do have free public health care seem to have support of their citizens. Is a little extra on taxes that bad if we get free health care? Some things may take longer to get, that's for sure, but don't believe all the propaganda the government likes to tell you.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	my opinion is not a good one. My husband and I have 2 kids, we both work 40 plus hours a week and cannot afford health insurance. We have been on Maine care because we couldn't afford it, then he got a raise and he and my stepson were dropped because he makes 20 dollars too much. He needs a hernia operation and we can't pay for it. I feel the government wants us dependent on them. You just get ahead a little and they pull the rug out from under you so that you have to work less hours and be poor to get any help. I think it should be free for anyone. This is America for God's sake. No one should be without insurance.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Well, why don't you ask Canadians about how they feel regarding government-controlled health care.<br>  <br>  See how many of them are clogging up the court system suing the Canadian government because of the crappy health care system.|`|b38a792bf2cb6a7cf64e2b3989db936eaa	I like what we have now.

The elite can pay for the best doctors. If you are talking about what is best for the average citizen, for society, than universal health care is the only viable option.<br>  <br>  Practically everyone can buy food. 1/3 of Americans can't afford health insurance.|`|NznqjqtPaa	In Australia a person earning the average income (circa $55000) will pay an additional $750 (or 1.5%) tax per year in order to guarnentee access to our universal health care system (medicare Australia).  If you have a dual income that equates to $1500 per year to cover your whole family, and it only costs that much if both partners are earning the average income. <br>  <br>  The crap people talk about universal health care being to expensive is just that:  Crap.  The Average cost for an American family to have health insurance is around $11000 per year.  I pay an extra 1.5% tax (about $950) for access to universal health care which entitles me to any treatment I need in hospital - no matter what pre-existing conditions I may have, and gives me a heavy discount (around 80%) if I just need to see my GP.  <br>  <br>  But yeah thye american system is better... rofl|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	You get what you pay for, but this price gouging in any other industry is illegal.<br>  <br>  As a recipient of Navy Medicine for many years and having seen many misdiagnosed cases that ended in death of the patient, I know socialized medicine isn't the way to go.  If the government would only cover catastrophic illness, insurance should be very reasonably priced for everyone.|`|5eSJpYbMaa	I think nationalized health care will reduce the quality of healthcare. Free market is what keeps health care business competitive which in turn produces better quality healthcare.<br>  <br>  Plus, it's not like nationalized healthcare will save anyone money.

This statement means it came from all areas:  insurance companies and CEO'S, greedy sue happy attorneys, greedy  unregulated drug companies(our meds are cheaper in Mexico and Canada) and high costs of medical procedures by docs. Bottom line Capitalism is no longer Capitalism so it cannot possibly work.  <br>  <br>  It remains to be seen whether or not Government will improve this situation.  But one things for sure----we are too corrupt within our so called free-market system. <br>  <br>  It is either a sad situation or an incredible opportunity.

He will get laughed out of court trying to sue you for them. Especially when he put in writing that they were a gift for the child.

If you are in Australia, take the emails to court with you, pictures of the items, christmas cards or gift cards, any other evidence of your relationship etc. You will be appointed a mediator who will see you and him together, where you get to show this evidence. If you can't agree then, you will go through into the court where a decision will be made. My guess is you will get to keep this stuff. You can take someone with you to the tribunal, by the way, a parent, a friend, or an advocate or counsellor.<br>  <br>  If you are afraid of this process, go talk to someone at your nearest Community Legal Centre, or Women's Legal Service.

a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	Excluded middle (false dichotomy) is just one of the numerous fallacies upon which Creationists rely.|`|mSFjbetxaa	I believe that, in their small minds, they do think that knowledge will contradict God.  Evidently, the biblical god punishes for receiving knowledge.<br>  <br>  <br>  "Debating Creationists on the topic of Evolution is rather like trying to play chess with a pigeon; it knocks the pieces over, craps on the board, and flies back to its flock to claim victory." - Scott D.

So without Creationists there would be no science." - a really dumb fundie<br>  <br>  "Belief in evolution sends thousands to hell every day." - fundie|`|T8X7mrtHaa	Fundamentalist Christianity DOES require you to abandon scientific facts.  <br>  <br>  It is very much like saying "My God says the Earth is flat, and anyone who doesn't accept that on faith is going to hell."<br>  <br>  For this reason, it is a dying religion - thankfully, enlightenment may finally overcome ignorant superstition.|`|taOckxHxaa	Interesting questions.  I think that Science also can be a religion.  I think that Science does not necessarily support evolution.  Is evolution observable?  Thank you for your questions, its getting late for me here and I could think about these all night.|`|K24JFTOcaa	no, but i have accepted creation over evolution|`|AA10311549	There are several issues here which I believe need clarification:<br>  <br>  1)  You stated:  "...Of course, if someone has been born within a Christian (or other faith) home, inside a Christian community, goes to Church every Sunday and has raised his children in a Christian way... if you tell them that they can't have both at the same time, it's obvious who they will pick!"<br>  <br>  Do you assume that this usually happens, or just possibly can happen?  Many Churches teach that theological or dogmatic truth MUST be consistent with scientific truth since truth can onbly be one.  Many Christiuan religions allow for the scientific theories involved in evolution and the myriad of scientific knowledge which supports theese theories.  Just they ALSO teach that it was God who created the universe.  So He just "evolution" as a mechanism and part of his design.  In other words MOST Christian religions do NOT take the creation story found in Genesis as LITERAL.<br>  <br>  2)  When you use the term "Creationist" this could mean many things.  Of course there are some Fundamentalists Christian sects which DO state that the creation and Biblical history is to be taken LITERALLY.  These people refuse to acknowledge the theory of evolution.  Of course they do not have the slightest understanding of all the scientific knowledge today which refutes their LITERAL interpretation of scripture and make quite an effort to STAY as ignorant as possible.<br>  <br>  Read their "Manifesto for Christian Churches" for the irrational claims thay make about their specific brand of "TRUTH."  I firmly believe that the children these people raise, with their determined effort to make sure that their children use absolutely no logic or reason for acquiring "truth" are in fact guilty of the worst form of child abuse.<br>  <br>  3)  Many "religious" people misunderstand the scientific method.  It is basically a fact finding mission.  With the facts we do know we then formulate theories to "explain" these facts.  This in turn leads us to make some further surmises and point us to new areas of scientific exploration.  It is a continuous method of acquiring new facts and making theory fit them.  Strangely it is only recently that the "Big Bang Theory" of the formation of the universe has been given new life with some amazing new finds in astronomy recently.  (And to think that it was suggested more as a joke when it was first formulated).  Even strict Darwinism is no longer held by evolutionists today.  But this does not mean that evolution is "disproven" only our understanding of how it occurred have been refined.  What many people without a scientific background do not realize is that perhaps almost half of all human knowledge supports either directly or indirectly the theory of evolution.<br>  <br>  To make statements as found in the Fundamentalists' "Manifesto" does absolute violence to both reason and logic.  They state that the INERRANT LITERAL BIBLE must be taken as TRUTH if it conflicts with scientific knowledge.  Which it does in many many ways.<br>  <br>  4)  Recently there has been a flurry of ideas around the notion of :"Intelligent Design"  What people seem not to be able to understand is that religion and (some) philosophy is NOT science.  These ideas can be presented with perhaps arguments of some degree of persuasion but are NOT open to the scientific method of testing.  Literal creationism or Inteligent Design are religious or philosophical ideas and NOT science, since they can NOT be tested within the realm of the material universe.  To teach "Literal Creationism" alongside evolution in a science course is an absurdity.  It would be just as absurd to teach astrology alongside astronomy.<br>  <br>  But getting back to Intelligent Design there is something to this that I really like.  It states that all of creation is propelled by the design of God.  I like that idea and so no problem believing it along side evolution.<br>  <br>  And what I REALLY like about it, it shows that GOD DID "design" me as a homosexual after all.  Since we do exist GOD MUST have directed our design.<br>  <br>  5)  WOW.  I have been reading some of the other replies.  How is it that so many "religious" people think that they can speak about "evolution" while not having the slightest understanding of what it is all about?  Please -- read a book or two.  Or thirty.  Or a hundred.  How can you all be so satisfied to remain so ignorant?<br>  <br>  6)  WOW  Someone wrote:  "I think that Science also can be a religion."  How totally ignorant can a person be?  Science tries to explain the physical universe through observation and formulation theories which can explain what we know and predicting what we do not know.  When our predictions are proven true we become more sure of our theory.  If the predictions are proven false, then we know we must modify our theories.  What this person seems to be unable to understand is that there are TWO kinds of "belief"  One is a belief based on a critical evaluation of information we either gather ourselves, or that which has been gathered by others.  I have never been to japan but i know (or believe) that it exist after making a critical evaluation from information i have received from others who HAVE been there, etc.  Thus all scientific knowledge MUST be able to be OBSERVED by some method in the material universe.<br>  <br>  However "Religious" truth, and some philosophical truth is NOT able to be observed by ANYONE.  Thus God's existence can NOT be proven scientifically.  A "Belief" in God is based on persuasive arguments.  (Which do NOT persuade some).  BUT no one can make any observation of any facts in our material universe which can PROVE Gods existence.  This therefore is a matter of "Religion."  There are all manner of "religious" truth believed by people that is NOT a subject of the observable universe.  But this does not say that an argument can not be persuasive.<br>  <br>  What I do however despise are those people still willing to "believe" things as "religious truth" which are so obviously proven untrue by science.  And TOO often these people based their "unbelief" about these "scientific facts" without any real understanding of what they are talking about.|`|5aDMFGykaa	The same old story again... You see I think... The only thing that they doing is to try to prove evolution wrong... You will never hear from them something that REALLY supports the theory of creation other than "the world is perfect/complex so a god made it etc etc.." They really seem not to understand..|`|5KYnkHphaa	There is support for the concept of creation. The problems that exist with The darwinian theory of evolution are not being taught in the school system. The concept of irreducible complexity as a system with a series of parts in which the removal of any part causes the entire system to cease functioning, examples of irreducible complexity of several biological systems, including the cilium, the bacterial flagellum, blood clotting, the immune system and intracellular gated and vesicular transport just to name a few.New discoveries are constantly pointing to intricate design that Darwin never dreamed of. Indeed, human designers are constantly learning from 'nature', in a growing field called biomimetics. Such design—and the information for this design—point to a Designer.<br>  Dr. Jonathan Sarfati spoke at the Seattle Creation Conference August 2007. He obtained a B.Sc. (Hons.) in Chemistry with two physics papers substituted (nuclear and condensed matter physics). His Ph.D. in Chemistry was awarded for a thesis entitled ‘A Spectroscopic Study of some Chalcogenide Ring and Cage Molecules’. He has co-authored papers in mainstream scientific journals on high temperature superconductors and selenium-containing ring and cage-shaped molecules. He also had a co-authored paper on high-temperature superconductors published in Nature when he was 22. and the webcast of that is on the link. The belief in evolution is just that a belief. there are scientists who believe that the science shows evidence of design rater than evolution. Teaching one side without the other is bias.|`|ERMegWHRaa	Yes. Yesterday I drove past a Baptist church six blocks from my home. In large letters, their sign read,"Evolution is to science as quackery is to medicine." This is in a rather liberal college town!  Data shows that three out of four people that accept the theory of evolution(in USA) are Christians. What is really shocking is that only 50% of Americans accept it while in Europe 75% to 95% accept it. Fundamentalist Christians have made evolution into an evil like gay marriage and abortion. I have the impression that it's what they hate that brings in the crowds and the contributions.|`|GFEWLxeiaa	No "creationalist" that I know of has any problem at all embracing both their belief in the supremecy of God AND science.  The two are not exclusive of each other.  You really can believe in both.<br>  <br>  The "creationists" that I know have a problem with some people attempting to force unproven "science" down the throats of others, and calling it, "enlightenment" or "fact" or "truth."<br>  <br>  Just because a lot of people believe in evolution doesn't necessarily make it "truth."  Remember, at one time alot of people believed the earth was flat, and that proved to be wrong too, didn't it...|`|NvOro0igaa	I think creationists take themselves a little too seriously and need to lighten up.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	God gave me a brain and I use it. What you are really saying, is that because they are scientists they are smart and gee Christians must me idiots. There are thousands of scientists, Christian and otherwise who believe that there was a creator. The Universe is too complex and beautiful and there is an order in things for it to have all just poped out of a box. I don't need a few thousand pages to tell me that in the beginning God created the Heavens and the earth. I open my eyes and enjoy it all. <br>  <br>  If you have children you will probably pass your beliefs on to them as the truth. I have done the same with my children. All three have gone on to question and do their personal homework and have decided that what Mom taught them was the truth. <br>  <br>  I don't do anything twisted or underhanded. I don't care why you believe what you believe and I can't understand why you give a care about my beliefs.|`|WcuU7IZ7aa	. I was raised Baptist and went to church nearly every Sunday as a child. Honestly I don't remember the issue of creationism vs. evolution being an issue.Of course I was probably doodling on the paper program they hand out. Maybe I was just lucky enough to have cool parents and a nice church that didn't focus on that kind of stuff. Anyways I believe in evolution. And I believe in God. I go to church maybe three times a year (no not the holidays). I think sometimes Christians and other theists are mistakenly thought of as mindless zombies who can't think for themselves. That bugs me. Also give kids some credit! They have enough brains to sort out theories and truth on their own.Please, who actually believes everything they heard as a child? Are you saying that people are doomed to believe everything they hear ? Also the point of the Christian bible isn't to teach creationism! I don't understand why it has become such a big dramatic issue.

While she is still all pissy, politely tell her that this situation is not working and that you and the other room mate has decided that she should move out as soon as possible.<br>  Wait until you see that reaction!  Or, if she says fine....then good riddance.  Who needs to "walk on eggshells" or put up with crap out of a woman like this.  Life is too short, and you are enabling inappropriate actions within your own home if you put up with it..

She does not use a computer, so cannot entertain herself on the internet when she does not have anything to do, so instead of bringing a book, magazine, etc. she just crosses her arms over her chest and stares.... at me.  Sadly,  I'm the one closest to her.  I could just pop her!  Of course, smacking an old lady around at the office is really rude, but I dream at night of doing just that.  I've actually rearranged my work space so I face away from her and she cannot see my face.  Had I remained facing the other direction, I would have done her bodily harm.

Why should anybody believe in such a nonsense.

Now, the reason why things aren't usually racist when it's bad-mouthing white people is okay is totally unknown to me. If we're going to make fun of each other, it needs to be open to all or to no one at all.|`|m2jeeo4Laa	No, the article isn't racist.  The article is covering the outcry surrounding the political cartoon, and explaining the meaning of the cartoon and why many are upset by it.  If you are asking if the cartoon is racist, it isn't, but it is understandable why at first glance a person could think it was a negative, bigoted dig at our President.   Al Sharpton explained why he is bothered by the cartoon, and while he doesn't speak for all whites or blacks, he does represent those who are offended by it.  I do think it's important to have leaders that represent the black community, even still.  You don't have to agree with what he, or Jesse Jackson, says though.   There are times when I agree with what they say, and others that I'm just annoyed and shocked at what comes out of their mouth.  Many, many blacks feel the same way.  I understood the cartoon when I first saw it, but I can see how it is offensive.|`|da3f31f0285fe3fe3296aa9f25dca37eaa	Because of the history this country has.  That article was inappropriate because in the past, blacks have been referred to as monkeys or apes.  And lets not forget all the problems with blacks and the police in NY.  That is what made this article inappropriate.  Not to mention the fact that the writer tried to say he was combining two news events into one article.  You can't compare the incomparable.  Those two news events had nothing to do with each other.  This article could have been done in better taste.

Conservatively, the Scriptures name at least 44 signs.  I've found this website, where you can read through the signs for yourself, since they are too numerous to list here:  <a href="http://www.rapturealert.com/signsofhiscoming.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rapturealert.com/signsofhisco...</a>|`|AA11935435	Well, Actually, there is only one sign,that is composed of more events than one!<br>  How We Know We Are in “the Last Days?<br>  HOW can we be sure that we are living at the time when God’s Kingdom will take action against this present system of human rule? How can we know that we are very close to the time when God will bring an end to all wickedness and suffering?<br>   The disciples of Jesus Christ wanted to know those things. They asked him what “the sign” would be of his presence in Kingdom power and “of the conclusion of the system of things.” (Matthew 24:3) Jesus answered by detailing world-shaking events and conditions that would combine to show that mankind had entered “the time of the end,” “the last days” of this system of things. (Daniel 11:40; 2 Timothy 3:1) Have we in this century seen that composite sign? Yes, we have, abundantly so!<br>  <br>   Jesus foretold that ‘nation would rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.’ (Matthew 24:7).  In 1914 the world became involved in a war that saw the mobilizing of nations and kingdoms in a way that was different from any war before it. In recognition of that fact, historians at the time called it the Great War. It was the first war of its kind in history, the first world war. Some 20,000,000 soldiers and civilians lost their lives, far more than in any previous war.<br>  4 World War I marked the beginning of the last days. Jesus said that this and other events would be “a beginning of pangs of distress.” (Matthew 24:8) That proved true, as World War II was even more deadly, some 50,000,000 soldiers and civilians losing their lives. In this 20th century, well over 100,000,000 people have been killed in wars, more than four times as many as in the previous 400 years put together! What an enormous condemnation of human rule!<br>  <br>   Jesus included other features that would accompany the last days: “There will be great earthquakes, and in one place after another pestilences [disease epidemics] and food shortages.” (Luke 21:11) That well fits events since 1914, as there has been a huge increase in the distresses from such calamities.<br>   Major earthquakes are regular occurrences, taking many lives. The Spanish influenza alone killed about 20,000,000 people following World War I—some estimates being 30,000,000 or more. AIDS has taken hundreds of thousands of lives and could take millions more in the near future. Each year millions of people die of heart ailments, cancer, and other diseases. Millions more die the slow death of hunger. Without a doubt the ‘horsemen of the Apocalypse’ with their wars, food shortages, and disease epidemics have been cutting down large numbers of the human family since 1914.(Revelation 6:3-8).<br>   Jesus also foretold the increase in crime that is experienced in all lands. He said: “Because of the increasing of lawlessness the love of the greater number will cool off.”(Matthew 24:12).<br>  8 Further, Bible prophecy foretold the moral collapse so evident throughout the world today: “In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power . . . Wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse.” (2 Timothy 3:1-13) All of that has come true right before our eyes.<br>  Another Factor<br>   There is another factor responsible for the huge increase in suffering in this century. Coinciding with the beginning of the last days in 1914, something happened to put mankind in even greater danger. At that time, as a prophecy in the last book of the Bible relates: “War broke out in heaven: Michael [Christ in heavenly power] and his angels battled with the dragon [Satan], and the dragon and its angels [the demons] battled but it did not prevail, neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven. So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.”(Revelation 12:7-9).<br>   What were the consequences for the human family? The prophecy continues: “Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.” Yes, Satan knows that his system is nearing its end, so he is doing everything he can to turn humans against God before he and his world are put out of the way. (Revelation 12:12; 20:1-3) How debased those spirit creatures are because they misused their free will! How awful conditions have been on earth under their influence, especially since 1914!<br>   It is no wonder that Jesus foretold of our time: “On the earth anguish of na|`|qCtbizzPaa	Al Gore won an Oscar.|`|waz8ONEEaa	from another poster:<br>  <br>  "1.People will turn away from the True God.<br>  2.Kids will rebe against their parents.<br>  3.Famine<br>  4.Sexual immorility.<br>  5.War<br>  6.Poverty<br>  7.People are lovers of themselves"<br>  <br>  do tell me: when in history HASN'T this stuff happened?|`|lqkyY2UQaa	1.People will turn away from the True God.<br>  2.Kids will rebe against their parents.<br>  3.Famine<br>  4.Sexual immorility.<br>  5.War<br>  6.Poverty<br>  7.People are lovers of themselves<br>  I believe these are happening today|`|5shqstYraa	We are very close to the end time, no matter how many signs are past.|`|u2BVwAKNaa	None, you really believe that when someone dies then can return??|`|e4faab4ffbfc5318a5f2dd566f521533aa	What do you consider the seven signs to be?|`|TYstsM7Yaa	Is one of the signs seeing Jesus's picture in my grilled cheese sandwich?<br>  <br>  If it is i would say there has been 1 sign.|`|QdjmzwCWaa	The moon turned red like blood.... search it,

Good luck.|`|AA11935435	NO YOU ARE NOT CRAZY!  But you certainly have, opened yourself up to demon (wicked spirit) influences, as you said, at your house you were reading about ouija boards, to look at making one, you were playing with fire, because you don't realize, that,the fact is, that wicked spirits are out to harm humans, so Jehovah God gives warnings to protect his servants. Read the following warning to the nation of Israel. It gives you an idea of methods that the demons use to mislead people. The Bible says: “There should not be found in you .?.?. anyone who employs divination, a practicer of magic or anyone who looks for omens or a sorcerer, or one who binds others with a spell or anyone who consults a spirit medium or a professional foreteller of events or anyone who inquires of the dead. For everybody doing these things is something detestable to Jehovah.” (Deuteronomy 18:10-12) We should want to find out what wicked spirits are doing to harm people today and how we can protect ourselves from them. But before we learn about this, let us consider when and how the wicked spirits got their start.<br>  <br>  Satan, as “the god of this system of things,” uses worldly governments and false religion to blind people to Bible truths. (2?Corinthians 4:4) Another important way that wicked spirits mislead men and women is through spiritism. What is spiritism? It is the getting in touch with wicked spirits, either directly or through a human medium. Spiritism brings a person under the influence of the demons. The Bible warns us to keep free from every practice connected with spiritism.—Galatians 5:19-21; Revelation 21:8.<br>   Divination is a very common form of spiritism. It is the practice of trying to find out about the future, or about something unknown, with the help of unseen spirits. This is shown by what the Christian disciple Luke wrote: “A certain servant girl with a spirit, a demon of divination, met us. She used to furnish her masters with much gain by practicing the art of prediction.” The apostle Paul was able to free the girl from the power of this wicked spirit, and no longer was she able to foretell the future.—Acts 16:16-19.<br>   Many people are interested in spiritism because it is mysterious and strange. It fascinates them. So they become involved with witchcraft, voodooism, hypnotism, magic, astrology, Ouija boards or something else connected with spiritism. They may read books about these things, or go to movies, or watch television programs about them. They may even go to a meeting where a medium seeks to contact the spirit world. But all of this is unwise for a person who wants to serve the true God. It is also dangerous. It can lead to real trouble now. Also, God will judge and cast away from him all practicers of spiritism.—Revelation 22:15.<br>   Even when a person does all he can to keep free from spiritism, he may still come under attack by wicked spirits. Recall that the voice of the Devil himself was heard by Jesus Christ, tempting him to break God’s law. (Matthew 4:8,?9) Other servants of God have had such attacks. The apostle Paul said: “We have a wrestling .?.?. against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.” This means that every servant of God must “take up the complete suit of armor from God, that [he] may be able to resist.”—Ephesians 6:11-13.<br>  <br>   What should you do if a “voice” from the spirit world speaks to you? What if the “voice” pretends to be a dead relative or a good spirit? Well, what did Jesus do when the “ruler of the demons” spoke to him? (Matthew 9:34) He said: “Go away, Satan!” (Matthew 4:10) You can do that too. Also, you can call on Jehovah for help. Pray out loud and use God’s name. Remember that he is more powerful than are wicked spirits. Follow this wise course. Do not listen to such voices from the spirit world. (Proverbs 18:10; James 4:7) This does not mean that everyone who hears “voices” is being spoken to by demons. At times the hearing of voices can be traced to certain physical or mental illnesses.<br>   Maybe at one time you shared in some practice of spiritism and you now want to break free. What can you do? Well, consider the example of early Christians at Ephesus. After they had accepted the “word of Jehovah” preached by the apostle Paul, the Bible says: “Quite a number of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them up before everybody.” And these books were worth 50,000 pieces of silver! (Acts 19:19,?20) In imitation of those who became Christ’s followers at Ephesus, if you have objects in your possession that are directly related to spiritism the wise course is to destroy them no matter how costly they are.<br>   Since there is so much interest today in the strange and mysterious, more and more persons are becoming involved in spiritism. Most of these persons, however, do not know that they are actually becoming involved with wicked spirits. This is not innocent fun. Wicked spirits have power to hurt and harm. They are vicious.

If you aren't, then it's not your suicide that would send you to Hell, it's your refusal to believe.<br>  <br>  But if you are a truly born again believer, suicide will NOT send you to Hell; even if suicide was a sin, Yeshua (Jesus) paid the price for ALL of your sins on the cross.  As such, Paul wrote that NOTHING can separate us from the love of Christ, not even death.  I believe him.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  There are many people who answered this question without truly knowing what Baptists teach on this matter.  Here are a few Baptist web sites that discuss suicide; NONE of them state that suicide sends a saved believer to Hell:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.godissues.org/articles/articles/616/5/Suicide-scriptures-and-the-grace-of-God/Page5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.godissues.org/articles/articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.renewingyourmind.com/Articles/Suicide.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.renewingyourmind.com/Articles...</a><br>  <br>  So those of you who answered "yes" to this question, please educate yourselves.|`|6TuyXuJRaa	All denominations believe that is a fast track to hell.|`|AM7cK4L9aa	God might get mad for getting in the way of His plans for your life.|`|7FPvEWb4aa	JJ,<br>  <br>  From the point of view of an AB?  What does that have to do with anything? You could just as easily have asked "from the point of view of a Martian?"<br>  <br>  The only view that matters is that of God's.  After all, He's the one who holds the keys to death and to hell.  He's not handed those keys to you.<br>  <br>  Luke 12:4."I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more.<br>  5.But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after the killing of the body, has power to throw you into hell.

God knows what each of us is going thru and some people have such a difficult life. I'm not saying that God will not help you but He doesn't always relieve the pain that people suffer. He does understand and perhaps we just don't have what it takes to carry on. We have given up hope.|`|gdYN39gtaa	We people here on answers do not make those decisions.<br>      God knows the heart and actions of every person, and He<br>      alone will decide your fate.  If you love Him and believe in<br>      Him truly........your chances of going to hell are less.|`|pvezh17Maa	The term "suicide" means self-murder.  Killing is a sin, in most christian religions, that merits hell...so they say.|`|sPDOMTTjaa	An American Baptist can't answer that question for you; only one can & that's God Himself. So, your answer is 'I don't know'.|`|4FR9d17Xaa	If you were a Christian then no. If not a Christian then yes.|`|9wiiBmBBaa	Probably, it's not natural. But that wouldn't be my reason not to do it.

Do you want to be condemned to hell?  Suicide is a form of murder.  God forgives murder and is willing to do so, but no one can tell you where you will end up in the end of times.  Only God knows.  Remember that once you die, even through suicide, there isn't anymore you can do.|`|jqZY0OyPaa	yea, ur going to hell.|`|pOlDMXWdaa	All Christians believe you have to be saved by Jesus Christ in order to go to Heaven. If you were saved, you would depend on your savior, and suicide wouldn't enter your mind. A person that is about to commit suicide has lost all hope. A saved person would have the hope of Jesus Christ. So, yeah, I think a person committing suicide would not be saved, and therefore, go to hell.|`|WYk0zYdhaa	It is a question many have asked.... meaning if Jesus died for all our sins past present and future would that include suicide?  It depends on what you believe.  For instance if you believe in eternal salvation then no you would not go to hell because once saves always saved.  However, if you believe that we need to repent for our sins it would be very difficult to repent after the fact.  I have to do some more study on this.... I used to think it was clearly black and white that if you did not repent you were out of relationship with God thus your salvation was not secure.  Now, I'm not so sure.   <br>  <br>  So far it seems to me that we would still be playing God, that IF someone other than a mentally ill person who didn't know any better (I think that God gives grace to them) were to take their own life they would be out of relationship with God and will have turned their back on HIM.  Do you think that if that were the case that person would go to Heaven?  <br>  <br>  Very thought provoking and requires more study.|`|UzrtmZ4Vaa	Yes you will! Life is the one true gift God gave you, and to take it away at your own hand is selfish and wrong. I hate the idea of suicide. It's a permanent solution to a temporary problem. You don't know what God has in store for you and you shouldn't be selfish enough to disregard his plan and just end your life.|`|lJ2baVliaa	I think that would depend on your mental state at the time.<br>  <br>  If you understood that your actions would actually cause your death, then you'd be guilty of murder.<br>  <br>  If you didn't understand that your actions would cause your death due to some mental illness... then there is room for argument there.<br>  <br>  I'm not baptist, but that's my opinion.|`|h5xhbNBtaa	No, you won't.  Because if you are a christian and you love, trust, and accept Jesus as your personal savior then when you are going through the darkest moment in your life (suicide) do you really think that God would abandon you in a horribly low moment.  He is always with you.|`|TYstsM7Yaa	I asked a close question not too long ago.<br>  If you accept jesus as your savior, all sins should be accounted for so you "should" go to heaven.<br>  <br>  But some christians seem to disagree, because even though they don't seem to understand the logic that God is not real. They relize death is not gonna be fun.|`|IrQRizoVaa	well if by saying american baptist you mean God is the centre and control of your life and you are looking to follow Jesus' example then why would you want to do that in the first place? wouldnt you want to please him and do the best you can in your life?|`|Ba5PVgHMaa	If anyone commits suicide it is selfish. God is the one who gave us this life, and only he has the right to take it away. If you commit suicide with that selfish intent, then yes you would go to hell.|`|VEfh03cAaa	according to baptist yes you would.... and according to most religions... yes you would.|`|RJOvm2Hmaa	i am not baptist but it is Christen and i am Lutheran so you wood go to <br>  hell|`|5shqstYraa	Most would say yes because of the commandment Thou shall not kill.|`|m3YC7Jcyaa	Hell it is then.|`|ISgaIA1haa	The way I see it (as a Baptist) is a sin is a sin.  Whether that sin be murder, suicide, etc, a sin is still a sin. And as long as you are saved and have given your life to God, all of your sins are forgiven.<br>  Hope this helps :)|`|Qm2jRRWSaa	well committing suicide is really selfish because your not only harming yourself(obviously) but you are also harming your loved ones. i mean, if youre the only person in their life, who else can they turn to?|`|CMvJleyQaa	Yes. Suicide is taking your life which was given to you for some reason. The only way you can excuse yourself for such action is if you in your heart and mind felt that "it's ok."|`|CHUDVsbEaa	This is a unanswerable question first off no one knows if god actually exists second if he does exist who says a hell exists and if a hell exists who knows if you would got to hell or not.|`|OzYgAV4Raa	Before you commit suicide be sure to send letters to Eminem.|`|HAmtRpGJaa	the american baptist is insane

Although the concept of relativity was not introduced by Einstein, his major contribution was the recognition that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant and an absolute physical boundary for motion. This does not have a major impact on a person's day-to-day life since we travel at speeds much slower than light speed. For objects travelling near light speed, however, the theory of relativity states that objects will move slower and shorten in length from the point of view of an observer on Earth. Einstein also derived the famous equation, E = mc2, which reveals the equivalence of mass and energy.<br>  <br>  When Einstein applied his theory to gravitational fields, he derived the "curved space-time continuum" which depicts the dimensions of space and time as a two-dimensional surface where massive objects create valleys and dips in the surface. This aspect of relativity explained the phenomena of light bending around the sun, predicted black holes as well as the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) -- a discovery rendering fundamental anomalies in the classic Steady-State hypothesis. For his work on relativity, the photoelectric effect and blackbody radiation, Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 1921.<br>  <br>  Theory of Relativity – The Basics<br>  Physicists usually dichotomize the Theory of Relativity into two parts.<br>  <br>      * The first is the Special Theory of Relativity, which essentially deals with the question of whether rest and motion are relative or absolute, and with the consequences of Einstein’s conjecture that they are relative.<br>  <br>      * The second is the General Theory of Relativity, which primarily applies to particles as they accelerate, particularly due to gravitation, and acts as a radical revision of Newton’s theory, predicting important new results for fast-moving and/or very massive bodies. The General Theory of Relativity correctly reproduces all validated predictions of Newton’s theory, but expands on our understanding of some of the key principles. Newtonian physics had previously hypothesised that gravity operated through empty space, but the theory lacked explanatory power as far as how the distance and mass of a given object could be transmitted through space. General relativity irons out this paradox, for it shows that objects continue to move in a straight line in space-time, but we observe the motion as acceleration because of the curved nature of space-time.<br>  <br>  Einstein’s theories of both special and general relativity have been confirmed to be accurate to a very high degree over recent years, and the data has been shown to corroborate many key predictions; the most famous being the solar eclipse of 1919 bearing testimony that the light of stars is indeed deflected by the sun as the light passes near the sun on its way to earth. The total solar eclipse allowed astronomers to -- for the first time -- analyse starlight near the edge of the sun, which had been previously inaccessible to observers due to the intense brightness of the sun. It also predicted the rate at which two neutron stars orbiting one another will move toward each other. When this phenomenon was first documented, general relativity proved itself accurate to better than a trillionth of a percent precision, thus making it one of the best confirmed principles in all of physics.<br>  <br>  Applying the principle of general relativity to our cosmos reveals that it is not static. Edwin Hubble (1889-1953) demonstrated in 1928 that the Universe is expanding, showing beyond reasonable doubt that the Universe sprang into being a finite time ago. The most common contemporary interpretation of this expansion is that this began to exist from the moment of the Big Bang some 13.7 billion years ago. However this is not the only plausible cosmological model which exists in academia, and many creation physicists such as Russell Humphreys and John Hartnett have devised models operating with a biblical framework, which -- to date -- have withstood the test of criticism from the most vehement of opponents.<br>  <br>  Theory of Relativity – A Testament to Creation<br>  Using the observed cosmic expansion conjunctively with the general theory of relativity, we can infer from the data that the further back into time one looks, the universe ought to diminish in size accordingly. However, this cannot be extrapolated indefinitely. The universe’s expansion helps us to appreciate the direction in which time flows. This is referred to as the Cosmological arrow of time, and implies that the future is -- by definition -- the direction towards which the universe increases in size. The expansion of the universe also gives rise to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the overall entropy (or disorder) in the Universe can only incre|`|6LBJgACSaa	If you punch your nose in the correct and proper position , it will knock you out and perhaps kill you =)<br>  <br>  LMAO@Sara ahaha|`|WyjRm10jaa	i want to sleep..<br>  but i can't..<br>  after 5 more answer..<br>  ill go for my bed..|`|WmU7jhObaa	Benadryl

Between them was a yawning gap (the phrase is sometimes left untranslated as a proper name: Ginnungagap), and in this gap a few pieces of ice met a few sparks of fire. The ice melted to form Eiter, which formed the bodies of the hermaphrodite giant Ymir and the cow Aueumbla, whose milk fed Ymir. Aueumbla fed by licking the rime ice, and slowly she uncovered a man's hair. After a day, she had uncovered his face. After another day, she had uncovered him completely: Búri.<br>  <br>  Ymir fathered Thrudgelmir, as well as two humans, one man and one woman. Búri fathered Borr. Borr had three sons, Vili, Ve, and Odin, who killed the giant Ymir. In the vast flood of Ymir's blood, Trúegelmir was also drowned, although not before he had fathered Bergelmir. Bergelmir and his wife hid in a hollow tree trunk and survived. Odin and his brothers used Ymir's body to create the universe : they ground his flesh into dirt, and the maggots that appeared in his flesh became the dwarves that live under the earth. His bones became the mountains, and Odin strew his brains into the sky to create the clouds. The universe comprises nine worlds, of which this earth (Midgard) is central.<br>  <br>  They placed four dwarves: Noreri (North), Sueri (South), Austri (East), and Vestri (West) to hold up Ymir's skull and create the heavens. Then using sparks from Muspelheim, the gods created the sun, moon and stars. As Odin and two others (differing between the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda) walked along the beach, they found two pieces of driftwood. From these, they created the first human beings: Ask and Embla. Ymir's eyebrows were used to create a place where the human race could live in; a place called Midgard.<br>  <br>  The gods regulated the passage of the days and nights, as well as the seasons. Sól is the personified sun, a daughter of Mundilfari, and wife of Glen. Every day, she rides through the sky on her chariot, pulled by two horses named árvakr and Alsvier. Sól is chased during the day by Sk?ll, a wolf that wants to devour her.

ctOge9SLaa	Hello brother.<br>  To me happiness depends on "happenings"and can be erratic and not long lasting.<br>  Joy on the other hand, is the sense of deep contentment  and inward satisfaction, that can be there no matter what the outward circumstances are.  Joy is an issue of the fruit of the Spirit and comes from our enjoyment of the riches of Christ dwelling in us.  We can be those rejoicing and filled with Joy.<br>  <br>  1 Peter 1:8<br>  Whom having not seen you, love, into whom though not seeing Him at present, yet believing you exult with joy unspeakable and full of glory.<br>  <br>  Hallelujah!<br>  We can testify, that the Kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit ( Rom 14:17)<br>  <br>  In this life, Joy is the solid one of the two, and is not dependent on the outward situations to be a certain way in order to be experienced.  When we are those who are in God's kingdom, there is the supply of the Holy Spirit, which is our source of inner contentment and deep satisfaction, and this joy will take us through anything.  This Joy is also a supply to those around us.  How blessed we are to have the Lord and all that He is to us.  I need the Joy of the Lord to be my daily strength to go on in this christian life.  I have the Joy of my Salvation day by day as I contact the Lord as my Source. With this Joy comes a clean heart and a renewed steadfast spirit.  How can anyone ask for more in this world, filled with so much sadness and in desperate need of a Savior and Joy giver.. Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  May more and more have a heart that is willing to turn to this Precious One.<br>  <br>  Grace of our Lord be with your spirit brother.<br>  Ty for this post<br>  Your sister<br>  sandy|`|MXYWSsM7aa	Hi Jimmy, Happiness is fleeting. It comes and goes in whatever situations we find ourselves in. Joy is something that we can dig deep to find no matter what the situation. People always say that grace is unmerited favor from God towards us. I find it to be more than that. Grace to me is the very enJOYment of Christ because it is He that can pull us through no matter what. <br>  Thanks and God Bless. :)|`|5JqCObDSaa	You can get happy when you have joy through your circumstance! See video below....do your still have Joy?  Joy is a fruit of the Spirit that no one can steal from you because it come from within. I think Joy is more important because having that Joy of the Lord produces happiness and your happiness can come and go depending on your circumstance like others have said, but that joy....you can't touch this : ) Praise the Lord...its in there! I gotta go get my praise on, cause I get joy when I think about ALL He's done for me! God Bless you Bro for asking.|`|axiA5mMoaa	Joy is as spiritual gift, happiness comes from pleasant happenings.<br>   You can mix sorrow with joy but you can't mix sadness with happiness.<br>  Joy the spiritual gift From God is more important & profitable,.<br>  Peace!!!|`|nv5Mewe3aa	Personally I see joy as a temporary emotion, a spike in your emotion if you will. I see happiness as a consistent state. Something that defines your overall level of contentment from day to day. Therefore I believe happiness is more important. But of course, I suppose it's how you'd interpret or define the two to make an argument for one or the other. Spiritually speaking I find scriptures concerning joy vs. happiness to support what I have said in most cases.<br>  <br>  Great Question!|`|5c6973113e114ed2747c54aecbdb1aa3aa	Happiness changes with experiences, difficulty, and hardship.  But joy you will always have in your heart no matter what you go through.  Even if you go through something reaaly depressing, you will still have that joy in your heart.  To me joy is more important because it's a stronger permanent happiness than happiness.|`|ruQFO71Zaa	Happiness is shallow. It comes and goes. If I gave you a $100 bill, then you'd be pretty happy right? Yeah! Who wouldn't? But after you spent it, that excitement is pretty much gone. That's what happiness is.<br>  Think about when you got saved. A new hope was placed inside of you, right? Now when you spend your $100, you're kinda like, oh bummer, but I still have hope in Christ! Same as when you go through something hard. Christ is always there, and he says that the joy of the Lord is our strength. Joy is stronger, happiness fades and is weak. Joy is more important ;D<br>  <br>  God Bless You<br>  Michelle SFECU<br>  (+HIM;-ME)|`|J4Wf5wo0aa	You need both of them in our life.<br>  Joy is coming in our heart from God  you could only attain by obeying God's will in our life.<br>  Happiness is coming from outside source or in our environment/family and others.|`|hkS2l6wBaa	i dont know. lol. but it is good to see you online.<br>  joy is down in your heart. Happy is a mood attatched to a circumstance, or memory,  or a season of your life. joy is long lasting. It is almost synomous with stability, serenity, and God like pride for your purpose in this life.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	Happiness come from pleasant circumstances in life. <br>  Joy comes from God which makes it far more important than happiness.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	I think joy is something that comes from the inside. It is something that you say to yourself "I'm not going to let things get to me today". It takes the place of worry when you live each day to the fullest. <br>  <br>  Happiness is something that makes you feel from outside yourself. Someone gives you flowers or says I love you. It is being content with what we have rather than being unsatisfied with life or what life throws at you.<br>  <br>  I think joy is the most important, because you have to do something to make yourself or others happy, but with joy, it comes from the heart.|`|EiiVMtjyaa	Dear Friend,<br>  <br>  True "joy" only comes from the spirit of the Lord.  It is something that no one can take away from you.<br>  <br>  Happiness, on the other hand is based on circumstances and feelings.  Temporary.

AA11047076	Theres a difference between allowing something and approving of something.  teh Torah allows polygamy, but does not approve it- we can see this through the term for a co-wife- Tsarah which comes from the same route as trouble Tzoros.  <br>  <br>  Teh issue used by Rabbeinu Gershom to prohibit polygamy was the abuse of women in polygamy and the difficulty in protecting them from harm and exploitation.  Now since polygamy, while allowed, was never a requirement or a mitzvah (positive commandment), but protecting the vulnerable in society is explictly commanded numerous times- Rabbeinu Gershom ruled that polygamy was outlawed to make sure the positive commandment of protecting the vulnerable in society would be fulfilled.<br>  <br>  The fact that his ruling gained universal acceptance (though only recently in some of the more isolated communities that had been outside of the Jewish mainstream) shows how universally the reasoning behind it as accepted by the Rabbis|`|8f79a6907c34a502a5158ce4ade3c011aa	Not sure but i do one Jewish woman who is interested in polyandry.

2pzaNkZbaa	Hi Sulky<br>  I can totally sympathise. If I'm reading you right, you're suffering from a lack of purpose and motivation. I'm the same way. If it don't move me I don't move at all - often for months at a time! <br>  I guess the trick is not so much in finding something to try out that you may or may not have a knack for, but rather in finding something that truly inspires you.

W8bs2VQSaa	While it hasn't changed my world or anything, I've certainly got a lot of enjoyment out of it. I like reading other people's opinions, reminiscences, stories about different experiences, on Seniors.  I also  lurk around Words and Wordplay, Books and Authors, and Womens Health and Pregnancy (well I am a midwife !) , and often know the answer, so that is a plus when you can help someone. <br>  <br>  As an insomniac, I like to get on the computer late at night, and when I'm done with card games and movie reviews, good old YA is a great way to pass the time.|`|ZW0JHvdraa	Really great question!  The internet can be a great avenue to interacting with people that we otherwise would never get to know.  We all have friends/family outside of yahoo answers but why stop there?  The world is wide-open, and why not explore everything it has to offer!<br>  <br>  Unlike other sites on the internet which seem to be inundated with some real questionable characters (to put it mildly), the Senior category here has some truly remarkable people with so much to offer others in the way of knowledge, experiences in life, and different viewpoints.  Most of us always try to respect & value one another's different views & opinions, and I believe that is what keeps us here.<br>  <br>  I will stay until it ceases to be informative, fun, and enjoyable, and I hope you will do the same!|`|ok6EGPnpaa	I'm sorry you feel that way -- I have made many many friends here, and "talk" to them every day.I've learned a lot aboutmany different cultures, and have people that I consider friends in all parts of this great big world. There are even a couple that I have talked to on the phone and am planning  a trip to meet a couple of them this summer. I admit that some of the time that I'm on here could be better spent, but I'm not here that much anymore because of the "T's" so I don't really consider it wasted.|`|4SF4KGu4aa	The benefit I get is from high blood pressure if I get into politics. So, I stay pretty much here where I rarely get angry over something as silly as a total stranger arguing or threatening me because of my political views. <br>  <br>  I have more in common in Seniors and I just enjoy it when someone gives me a trip down memory lane. Found what I consider to be friends here also.<br>  <br>  But you are right in the sense that I do this when I don't have something else to attend to.It doesn't keep me from working or chores.|`|24vQ8D71aa	yes, i have had valuable advice on gardening, cooking ,dogs and birds.and some serious belly laughs at the antics happening here in seniors. a laugh a day keeps the doctors away !!<br>  also thought provoking questions and answers on serious topics that hit most of us sooner or later.<br>  a good all rounder , love it :)<br>  <br>  ps i still have plenty of time to do other things , not necesarely better though.|`|5d93feba60a6599e3f77941fe4be59d6aa	Coming in here has shown me that I am not alone.

When it is stinking hot like it was today I could spend a few hours on here just reading about different people and their profiles.  It's a bit like people watching.  <br>  <br>  Working in the heat is not good for me, I don't sweat and my legs swell.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I never get on here, when I'm bored. But I do get on here, if I want to<br>  keep my mind active and fingers limber. That's good exercise, that<br>  I'm not limited on. I quite often learn something new in the process of<br>  being here. And occasionally, I'm told I have helped others with my<br>  answers.<br>     I always check YA after I've checked my emails, and some of the<br>  news headlines. Then I come here and check the early questions.<br>  And then I'm interested in what some have to say in response. Then<br>  I find a few I find I can respond to. I always look to see if the totals<br>  for 'best answerer' have moved up yet. And when I see they haven't,<br>  then I start answering questions.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	Why sure. If nothing else it's provided me the opportunity to have some fun and gain some knowledge. There are people on here that I would normally never have any contact with outside this monitor.<br>  Besides, it gives me something to do while eating ice cream and downloading insect porn.|`|xyt9NdjVaa	I've had more positive than negative here experiences,  and I refer to the Senior Citizens category.

hm54WmdRaa	hell no<br>  no daughter of mine dating sum cracker|`|ohUm00RYaa	ime dark skinned girls are most likely to date inter-racial because in the black community mid-brown skin girls are seen as the ideal.  The beyonce type black girl is like the ideal.  Then the light mariah carey type and then the darker.  So since dark girls are at the bottom of the food chain when it comes to dating they are more likely to date other races as black guys are not really interested in dating them|`|m2jeeo4Laa	I don't believe it is true.  I live in an area where I see many interracial couples.  I have seen white men with petite black women, and with larger black women; I've seen with relaxed hair, braids, and some I think have wigs.  <br>  I'm not sure the point of this question though.|`|AA12165563	Having dated women of color, I only prefer her attitude and air of dignity. I have been mocked and threatened physically by black men for dating black women, those of whom prefer white women. Black men say its alright for them but not the other way around for inter-racial relationships. I dated very light complected malotos to a university student from Uganda. American advertisers go for the light skin women of color and the black entertainers go for the very light black women. Many black men have told me they do not find dark skin women attractive.The most outspoken racist I have met and saw in the media are black men with white women. The double standard forces many white men from not dating black women from fear of the black male retaliation.|`|da3f31f0285fe3fe3296aa9f25dca37eaa	Yes, I would agree with that, I don't really know the answer as to why.  My assumption is that chemically treated hair is more like "white" hair.  (I could be totally off on that).  I really don't know, but usually, the white men I know who date black women, the women tend to be very proper, (not that other black women aren't).  I am forced to make generalizations in this answer for a lack of a better way to answer.  Usually here in AZ, most of the time, the relationship is the other way around so I don't have a lot of experience here. (black guy, white girl)|`|nyWoPO3oaa	Ive noticed all kinds of white guys with different types of black women - to the point i dont think thiers a stereotypical pairing that holds firm<br>  <br>  but as a non-black guy who likes black women, although i wouldn't say i have a strict type i do prefer dark skin and natural hair. I don't know why. I think the blacker a girl is the more attracted i am. lol

casg30Ataa	If you had it when you were a christian it makes a lot of sense actually. You were stuck in a worldview that says nothing else besides that specific belief really matters. You realized that other things do exist outside of your worldview but the others also stuck in your worldview tried to prevent you from escaping. You finally escaped in the dream just like you did in real life when you realized the ridiculousness of christianity.

Being corporeal, of flesh and blood, is a limiting experience afterall.  It sounds to me that your faith at the time though was indeed an impediment to your spirit, that the dogma weighed you down in misery.  I think the problem of "faith" lies in the literal as opposed to the metaphysical and mystical interpretation. Dogma and stories are just ways of expressing the unknown although that would be heresy to those who consider themselves "true believers."<br>  <br>  What do I think?  I think you are spiritual and evolved and walking about for now (maybe forever) as an "atheist."  I think that you have a vivid imagination and an intuition for the spiritual on the basis of this dream and I would encourage you to explore other paths of enlightenment before you throw the book of 'revelation' away because of 1 bad and limiting experience.  It sounds like you have a gift and that it broke thru in your dream.<br>  <br>  Just my 2 cents though.  Thanks for sharing the dream.

His symbols are the thunderbolt, eagle, bull, and oak. In addition to his Indo-European inheritance, the classical "cloud-gatherer" also derives certain iconographic traits from the cultures of the ancient Near East, such as the scepter. Zeus is frequently depicted by Greek artists in one of two poses: standing, striding forward, with a thunderbolt leveled in his raised right hand, or seated in majesty.<br>  <br>  Zeus was the child of Cronus and Rhea, and the youngest of his siblings. In most traditions he was married to Hera, although, at the oracle of Dodona, his consort was Dione: according to the Iliad, he is the father of Aphrodite by Dione. He is known for his erotic escapades. These resulted in many godly and heroic offspring, including Athena, Apollo and Artemis, Hermes, Persephone (by Demeter), Dionysus, Perseus, Heracles, Helen, Minos, and the Muses (by Mnemosyne); by Hera, he is usually said to have fathered Ares, Hebe and Hephaestus.<br>  <br>  His Roman counterpart was Jupiter and his Etruscan counterpart Tinia.

On top of that, the concepts told in the Bible are profound and build one on top of another similarly to the way  the concepts of math build upon each other.    The future prophecies in the Bible are also very precise.   Unlike Nostradamus, prophets like Daniel and Zechariah are exact and explicit in their descriptions <br>  <br>  Because of all these things, it is reasonable to believe that the Bible does in fact contain the absolute truth.    The stories of the Bible are not just stories.   Rather, the stories are a historical account written by eyewitnesses, and in a backdrop of archaeologically verifiable places and people.<br>  <br>  Just as you believe a math book contains the absolute truth regarding math, so it is just as reasonable to believe the Bible contains the absolute truth about God and his desire for mankind.|`|kQuFzK67aa	There was a period in european history where the Church controlled everyone.

You have to be careful with ideas because they can go places no one intended.  This is one of them.  He had to oppose Holy Tradition because 1 Clement, older than most of the bible, said he was not only wrong but opposed to the apostolic teaching.  So he dropped anything that he felt was not part of scripture, including James, Jude and Revelations.  It was put back into the bible by the Lutherans in the 17th century.  To try and win his battle he defended the "Five Solas' including Sola Scriptura--The Bible Alone.<br>  Until that happened no one would have made that argument.

He tells us how it all began<br>   (who else would know but the Creator?) He follows that with History<br>   of what happened next (ancient ruins have proved it all to be true).<br>   He has prophesied all through the Bible of what is to happen, and<br>   it is happening even today just as the Bible predicts.  And then He<br>   tells us how it all will end (the question everyone wants to know).<br>   Things are moving fast right now following to the letter the phophecies<br>   of the Bible. No other book can tell us how it began and how it all<br>   will end. No other God performed all the miracles Jesus did the 33<br>   years he was on Earth in person. No other God rose from the<br>   grave. I don't see how we can dismiss all this. The Bible really is<br>   the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

The use of carbon-14 dating is often misunderstood. Carbon-14 is mostly used to date once-living things (organic material). It cannot be used directly to date rocks; however, it can be used to put time constraints on some inorganic material such as diamonds (diamonds contain carbon-14). Because of the rapid rate of decay of 14C, it can only give dates in the thousands-of-year range and not millions.<br>  lee Strobel haed some things to say about that as well so I guess I need to read the rest of the Bible|`|kOIotbMnaa	who knows i believe but it was written by a guy and we don't even know what god looks like thats just how we made him look|`|iYfMPrUwaa	people without the mental capacity to make their own decisions need someone to tell them what to think. luckily organised religion is their to exploit them and tell them they're going to hell. the bible is their guidebook on how to sacrifice their identity for a series of hypocritical doctrines that are not only outdated but no different that 9/10s of the world's major religions.|`|qJkRPhIKaa	most people are conformers.|`|u2BVwAKNaa	That's what they were told and taught..<br>  <br>  Believe or burn in hell..|`|fyR9dmvWaa	I think some people just need something to believe in so that thing or things can help them through times.

But today with many of the tools of technology we can prove that the Bible is more than a religious book, the Bible has been given to us by God, there are 66 writers and 44 books all are consistent to the word, there are consistent numbers that flow through the bible with amazing accuracy, when the dead sea scrolls were found they proved that the books had not changed or had been miss interpreted. This forum could not give me enough space to go into all the reasons proving the Bible was handed to us by God. You owe it to your self to test the Bible, that's actually in the words of God do not just take our word for it test it. If God exists He wants us to know Him, He has reasons for you and I being here and He has a place He wants you to come to, the answers are all in the Bible, I dare you to look and find the truth, by not believing we have everything to loose, or Eternity to gain, there is a reason you were born.And there is a reason God gave us the Bible.

And even if you don't agree with the whole concept of faith, many prophecies and events recorded in the Bible have been recorded in history or have come to past. History doesn't lie and neither does the Bible. i'm not sure if i can explain it to you as well as i would hope to but i'll remember you and get back to you... i pray that God will lead you to the truth you're looking for and you embrace it with an open mind.|`|aOFsYynBaa	Well, truthfully, it is because people are afraid to die. Thus every society needs something to believe in beyond just life and death. Unfortunately the believers of a religion don't like being told that they are wrong. Thus many wars have been fought, and many people have been killed. Don't get me wrong, wars are fought generally because leaders are greedy. However, those leaders prey upon the beliefs which their constituents hold, making them believe that their religion has been attacked. Thus inspiring them to fight. To get back to the point, religion is something that people have blindly followed since the beginning of time. So why is the Bible the absolute truth to some? A foolish fear of death, and a need to have something to believe in. The same people who discredit evolution, believe the Bible is absolute truth. Although the only types of absolute truth in this world are derived from science, some still refuse to believe in it. All those who claim that evolution isn't real, may as well discard all electronics, all cars, all forms of technology. If you'd like to live in a world that does not accept evolution for what it is, then maybe you should take your own life back into the 14th century. Because science is fact, and evolution is science. Religions worldwide all interconnect into similar forms of belief. Afterlife, messiah, etc. The Bible is merely another form of the same. It may never die out because of its wide publication. It is certainly the best story ever told, and they are certainly lessons to be learned from it. However, is there an afterlife? No, I'm sorry, there isn't. You can believe as you please, I'm not here to change anyone's beliefs. Just to expel my displeasure that religion has created a world which I do not care for. Catholics, Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Hindi, etc... you are all responsible, you have brainwashed the world. Life is, what life is. We are born, we do the best we can to live the best we can, and we die. That's how my story will end.|`|PHlcM9YFaa	Well, if it keeps you out of Jail, it cant not be all that bad right?|`|DRzezllQaa	Because it is true!|`|8cmeDY2baa	That's a very good question.<br>  <br>  Many believe that the Bible is the word of God. If it is the word of God, then it can't be wrong. It has to be perfect and true. But if you read it with an open mind, you may discover a work of great evil, intended to instill fear and compliance in the ignorant and gullible for what motive, praise and glory for Himself and His worshipers.<br>  <br>  Just one small example in a book full of it: In the Book of Numbers Ch. 31, God rewards the men and soldiers of his chosen race with 32,000 virgins, to do with as they pleased, for slaughtering captive men, women and children prisoners. God also has hundreds of virgins delivered to His tent as a tax, so he may continue to favor the Israelites. What did God do with the virgins?<br>  <br>  This is the same God of the Jews, God of Jesus, the God of the New Testament and the God of Revelations. Taken literally or interpreted for meaning, this makes God a virgin raping, nation killing demon much worse than Hitler. He is the terrorist in every Christian and Jew heart.<br>  <br>  Here is the link to Number 31 for your reading, in case you don't believe me:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Bible.show/sVerseID/4666/eVerseID/4666/version/gnb" rel="nofollow">http://bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseacti...</a><br>  <br>  Whether you take your religious book literally or for meaning, first psycho-analyze the God therein for his character, good or evil. Is He tolerant or vengeful? A God of war or a God of peace? A God of humility and selflessness or a God of pride, demanding praise and glory? If you were God, how would you be? I am sure you are of good moral character. Know who you worship - good or evil.<br>  <br>  Would you sanctify holocausts, suffering, slavery, the theft of land and chattels, the killing of babies, the abuse of women and young girls, demand protection tax, frequent praise and worship? Compared to this God, Hitler looks like a school boy.<br>  <br>  Why do people worship the God of Moses? Because they are fearful, ignorant and gullible, or in the case of preachers, it's a livelihood.<br>  <br>  Truth conforms to the laws of nature. A "spiritual" God does not. That is why it is a belief, not a truth. So what made the Bible the absolute truth to some? Fear, ignorance, gullibility and perhaps the desire to be favored and rewarded.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  Forgive and Share|`|9FrBtCfDaa	faith, blind or otherwise.<br>  <br>  religion is not about reason, or logic.

The textbook answer has already been given in some of the answers I've read, so, let me give you my answer.<br>  <br>  I'm a mental health professional with 20+ years experience, now retired.  As I began seeing patients, I knew the textbook diagnoses and treatments, and so gave them.  And then, over the years, I began to realize that my "textbook treatments" didn't work to the extent that I felt the patient should get, especially for all  the money they were paying me.  And as I began searching my mind for "better" treatments, searching for "better" ways kept bringing ideas to mind.  Sometimes it was things my parents had told me decades before and sometimes it was something I had read in some book somewhere in school or in my private, independent reading.  Those "ideas" I remembered also were good, to a point, but not good enough for what I wanted for my patients.  And then, strange for this once "Bible hating / Christian hating" individual, some of those ideas began coming from sermons I had heard decades earlier, and Biblical quotes I had read or heard over the decades.  Now, I must admit here, that, as much as I now hate to admit it, I was one helluva Bible/Christian hater.  No joke.  And, as I recall, I MUST have scared my wife and some of our friends with all the very blunt and direct comments I'd make about Jesus, and "toward" Jesus, shaking my fist sometimes or even just giving Him a smirk or two, and plenty of bad words.  So, what in hell, pardon the language here, but, what in hell was I going to do with this Biblical nonsense.  And then, being as clinical and scientific and objective as I could be in my research and findings, I had to be honest, even if it went totally against my feelings at the time (which had been going on for YEARS), I had to honestly ask myself what was WRONG with those Biblical ideas and quotes.  And the shocker came when I couldn't find anything wrong with them.  So, being as clinical and scientific and objective as I could be, I applied them in my treatment with my patients, and, sit down if you're not ready for this one, my patients instantly began to become healthier.  They walked and talked and thought in a much more healthy manner!  This was VERY STRANGE to me.  And I still hadn't realized that my patients began getting better EXACTLY when I began bringing the Bible, and Jesus, into my counseling aspects of my treatment.  Now, I, like  you, wouldn't believe there was any correlation between the two.  I mean, that sounded "hocus-pocus" and miraculous-like, and I wasn't into any of that kind of stuff. But then, maintaining my objectivity, and clinical and scientific approach that I always demanded of myself, I HAD to be honest and say, "Why is this sudden improvement in  your patients NOT possibly a Biblical event?  A Christian event?"  There was no reason I could find why it couldn't be related to the Bible and Jesus, except through my bias or prejudice, and in my research and statistics classes, we were strongly trained to keep all biases and prejudices OUT of the research.  So, I had to admit that, on the findings I was now having about my patients and my introduction of Biblical / Christian learnings and findings, there was a DIRECT CORRELATON of the two to a statistically reliable and valid level!!!  My patients were definitely getting better, and it all began with the introduction of Biblical / Christian realities into treatment!!  I got so excited, despite that this violated ALL my anti-Christian / Biblical feelings for decades.  And like a scientist who found a new line of treatment, I went with it "gun-ho"or "gung-ho" (whatever), and my patients kept getting better wherein they could conclude treatment and go on to productive and enjoyable lives.  To this day, as I type my answer to  you, the emotional awe I feel as I recall this clinical reality still "gives me goosebumps" or whatever.  And I began applying these Biblical / Christian ideas in my personal and family life, and things became instantly and measurably better!  BUT, now that leaves me at "the fork in the road".  I'm at a point where I know several ways I can keep on the Biblical / Christian way, but, I haven't got the guts, the spiritual guts, to go along that way, and my spiritual life, my Christian life, is at a standstill, and suffering.  Why won't I take that "leap of faith"?  Because, as much as I hate to admit it, I'm chicken.  I'm scared.  I'm scared that maybe I've gone far enough, and if I go further, people will believe I've "gone off  the deep end".  Why am I such a coward?  The Bible has the answer, and I either haven't found it, or I'm such a chicken that I read right over the answer and failed to see it.  God help me.  So, do you want to know what made the Bible the absolute truth to me?  Because I've lived it, in my most precious aspect of my life (or so I thought), my profession.  You can read all the "textbook" answers you want, but|`|HyBcKAf7aa	have you ever read the Quraan?! it'll make alot of sens<br>  <a href="http://www.quran-islam.org/93.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.quran-islam.org/93.html</a><br>  this copy in english but if you speak arabic you'll understand better

TjQAs0BKaa	In the Adam and Eve story in the bible, God told them they could eat anything from anywhere in that garden except from this one apple tree.

pUOkWQ1yaa	I encountered this when I was going through confirmation. Raised in a Catholic family and attended Catholic school, I was always taught good works is what gets you into heaven. Religion just gives you may paths. <br>  <br>  But during confirmation school, the teacher said the later. I was devastated. He seems to be supported by the Bible too - with the exception of 1 verse. (I'll find it ... hold on.)<br>  <br>  I was morally opposed to that idea - such a shallow idea and elitist one too. I'm an Atheist now because of this revelation, but I think your idea is much better.<br>  <br>  The verse that Universal Christians give a lot of weight to is:  Timothy 4:10: that we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, and especially of those who believe. With this passage, they believe EVERY one eventually is saved.<br>  <br>  But there are A LOT saying faith alone will only save you. Read Roman I. Paul the Apostle pegs other religions as the creator of evil. And it clearly states that following other religions is evil and wicked. But some of the kindest people I have met are not Christians - so I cannot honestly believe anything in that chapter is correct.<br>  <br>  But in my honest opinion, I don't think anyone deserves eternity of torture. Punishment and torture doesn't bring back what was lost. And eternal torture never teaches. It bring nothing good - just allows for revenge. And revenge is just brings more evil into the equation - even if the perpetrator deserves it. It is exactly the opposite of "turning the other cheek." As a result, I am opposed of any idea of hell and withstand believing a religion who advocates such an afterlife.|`|2RKPtuL9aa	Salvation (from hell) is a free gift from God, "for by grace are ye saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is a gift of God, not of works (being good) lest any man should boast.|`|6ypnDnvLaa	I wouldn't lean towards a belief just because it's popular.  It could be popular to run off a cliff.  Christians believe the Bible to be "God's word" so what ever is written there is considered to be truth. <br>   The Website "Bible.org" gives great answers from this Christ-ian's point of view.   But the answers can be a bit lengthy so I use this free text to speech program called: "Balabolka"|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The thing is, popularity never determins truth.  So that isn't the way to get to the truth.  <br>  <br>  Jesus actually said that there is a broad way that leads to eternal torment in hell, and many go that way.  And then Jesus said there is a narrow way that alone leads to heaven, and fewer go that way.  So popularity leads to hell. <br>  <br>  The truth is that salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|QyAyQf3Laa	HELL: WHAT IS HELL?<br>  <br>  The religious clergymen of Christendom have created an image of what they understand to be “hell” or “inferno” in the minds of their church people. It is a terrible image. Their long-taught idea of “hell” or “inferno” depends upon the doctrine that they teach about the human soul. They imagine that the human soul is something separate and distinct from the human body. Also, that, whereas the human body is mortal and corruptible, the human soul is immortal and incorruptible, it being spiritual and hence invisible, something that we cannot feel with our sense of touch.<br>  <br>  So, as the clergy say, when the human body dies, the human soul does not die but survives, although we cannot see it with our natural eyes. Since it must now leave the body in which it has been dwelling, it must go somewhere in the invisible, spirit world. But where? Simply stated, the good souls go to heaven, but the bad souls go to hell. Heaven is thus set as opposite from hell, and as heaven is a place of everlasting happiness and blessing, so hell must be the place of everlasting suffering, eternal torment. The clergymen locate fire and brimstone there in hell.<br>  <br>  For many centuries the clergymen of Christendom have taught such an idea of “hell.” Since they claim that their teaching is what the Holy Bible says about “hell,” we are obliged to go directly to the Bible itself to find out exactly what it does say on this subject. O yes, the word “hell” or “inferno” does occur in various Bible translations scores of times, and according to those translations the Bible does teach that there is a “hell.” But the point is, What did the writers of the Bible say and show that this “hell” is? We must go according to what they show it to be, and not according to what others say that those Bible writers said it was. We can deceive ourselves by twisting what those Bible writers say.<br>  ------------------------------<br>  <br>  What Kind of Place Is Hell?<br>  <br>  MILLIONS of persons have been taught by their religions that hell is a place where people are tormented. According to the Encyclop?dia Britannica, “The Roman Catholic Church teaches that hell . . . will last forever; its suffering will have no end.” This Catholic teaching, the encyclopedia goes on to say, “is still held by many conservative Protestant groups.” Hindus, Buddhists and Muhammadans also teach that hell is a place of torment. No wonder that people who have been taught this often say that if hell is such a bad place they do not want to talk about it.<br>  <br>  Think about this. If the idea of roasting people in fire had never come into God’s heart, does it seem reasonable that he created a fiery hell for those who do not serve him? The Bible says, “God is love.” (1 John 4:8) Would a loving God really torment people forever? Would you do so? Knowing of God’s love should move us to turn to his Word to find out just what hell is. Who go there, and for how long?<br>  -----------------------------<br>  <br>  SHEOL and HADES<br>  <br>  Webster’s Dictionary says that the English word “hell” is equal to the Hebrew word Sheol and the Greek word Hades. The English translators of the Authorized Version, or King James Version, translated Sheol 31 times as “hell,” 31 times as “grave,” and 3 times as “pit.” The Catholic Douay Version translated Sheol 64 times as “hell.” In the Christian Greek Scriptures (commonly called the “New Testament”), the King James Version translated Hades as “hell” each of the 10 times it occurs. (Matthew 11:23; 16:18; Luke 10:15; 16:23; Acts 2:27, 31; Revelation 1:18; 6:8; 20:13, 14)<br>  <br>  What is Sheol, or Hades? The fact that the King James Version translates the one Hebrew word Sheol three different ways shows that hell, grave and pit mean one and the same thing. And if hell means the common grave of mankind, it could not at the same time mean a place of fiery torture. Well, then, do Sheol and Hades mean the grave, or do they mean a place of torture?<br>  <br>  The Hebrew word Sheol and the Greek word Hades mean the same thing: Psalm 16:10 Hebrew Scriptures and Acts 2:31 Christian Greek Scriptures, which verses you can see on the next page. Notice that in quoting from Psalm 16:10 where Sheol occurs, Acts 2:31 uses Hades. Notice, too, that Jesus Christ was in Hades, or hell. Are we to believe that God tormented Christ in a hell of fire? Of course not! Jesus was simply in his grave.<br>  <br>  Yes, good people go to the Bible hell. In all the places where Sheol occurs in the Bible it is never associated with life, activity or torment. Rather, it is often linked with death and inactivity. Sheol and Hades refer not to a place of torment but to the common grave of mankind. (Psalm 139:8) Good people as well as bad people go to the hell.|`|UE2fFzq7aa	If you're saying you're a christian, then you should probably already know this answer.  Start reading the bible.  But yes Jesus said "I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man comes to the Father but by me"  No matter how many "good deeds" you do you're still going to be guilty by God's standards because He is perfect, holy, and fair and will not let sin go unpunished.  That is why we need a savior and we need Jesus and as a substitute for our punishment.  If you're believing what you say you were raised as, you probably wouldn't wanna call yourself a Christian, but something else. ( I'm not saying this to be mean). <br>  <br>   As for those who have never heard of Jesus Christ?  That's a hard one, but the Bible says that even the heathen knows there is a God by his creation and Jesus says in Revelations, "behold I stand at the door and knock, if any man opens the door I will dine with him and he with me"  Jesus can reveal himself in different ways and I personally believe he knocks on the door of every man's heart.|`|V0oc22ryaa	No, that's what everybody thinks but the truth is that everybody is born on thier way to hell on roller skates, only Jesus died for us all, and He is the only door into heaven, so if you want to be saved from all sin and hell you have to accept Him into your heart as your own personal savior then live like it, read your bible and obey Jesus's commands, and this is how you begin your journey to heaven and steer away from hell<br>  <br>  Whisper this prayer to God so that only you can hear yourself and say:<br>  <br>  Lord Jesus I ask you to forgive me now of all my sins and come into my heart as I now repent of all my sins and be my own personal Lord and savior and save me now from all sin and hell, write my name in the lambs book of life so that on judgment day I will be allowed to enter heaven for accepting Jesus’s sacrifice of dying on the cross for me and I will not be cast into hell which  was not prepared for me but was prepared for the devil and his angels, I thank you now Lord Jesus that I am now saved and on my way to heaven because you are now in my heart as you have promised if I ask you to come in as you are not liar but are a God of your word,  now teach me all your correct ways and truths in which you would have me walk and make all my ways well pleasing in Your sight even as a sweet fragrance to thy nostrils and a sweet sound to thine ears In Jesus Holy Name, Amen.|`|VUK77SrXaa	Very intelligent question, unfortunately there is no easy answer.  <br>  <br>  Yes, there are two views and there isn't one view of heaven and hell.  There are probably as many different definitions of heaven and hell as there are religious sects in Christianity. <br>  <br>  The main reason is that the Christian Religions (all of them) are very intolerant.  The Christian faith, as originally preached by Jesus was very inclusive.  Just think about the people Jesus ministered to... not the "established society" but to the outcasts, and those who no one else cared about.  The only recorded incident in the Bible where Jesus got mad was at the formal religious structure (money changers and the reason for them).<br>  <br>  To translate that into today's time, Jesus would have a store front where he could help the prostitutes, conduct an outreach ministry to the gays (without condemnation), help those who are homeless and addicted to drugs, to the mentally ill who roam our streets...   You get the idea.  I really don't think he would have much to do with any of the formal religions that worship in his name.<br>  <br>  I know that this is probably not a very good answer to your question, but I'm not sure that there is a better one.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Thank you, Bellamax, for  your concern.  However, when all I hear and see from the "Christian" spokespersons of organized religion is the same as those two guys, so long ago...  I feel little real reason to change the decision I made back then, especially, when I see it present in your compassionate words.  I have a gay LIFE, not a "lifestyle is considered a sin by the Bible's standards"...  And you probably didn't even see just what an insult that one phrase was...|`|W0JeXey0aa	Works and deeds are what is the answer.  You get this problem since Luther was deceived by the devil and started the many of 50000+ so-called christian churches.  There is only ONE TRUE CHURCH AND ONE TRUE ANSWER TO ALL QUESTIONS!  Jesus established on true church, ONE leader, and ONE set of rules and ONE BIBLE.  Following all other lies and mistruths about his truth only leads to people being mislead like you.  Learn the truth.  God bless!|`|hR3AE1ARaa	believe on the lord Jesus Christ|`|AFNiSC6eaa	I believe alot of what is written in the bible is for a good reason, mostly scientific (like not having sex with your family members) (or not cutting down fruit trees) It all has to do with amplified chance of genetic mutation and conserving food. Now that i've said that i believe that your actions on earth are what affects it. If god wrote all these things to make sure we lived a good life on earth, maintained the earth, and made sure it was good for future generations, wouldn't he pay the most attention to that? Thats my opinion.|`|GFEWLxeiaa	If you genuinely want to know the answer to this question you need to study it out for yourself in God's word, the Bible.  If you don't know where to look first you can do a Google to find some Bible study sites on the Internet.  On those sites you can look up references to heaven and/or hell.  It might take a bit of time, but since it's such an important matter shouldn't you go straight to the source to find out what God really says on the subject?|`|hSEE0i1Haa	Most Christians believe in the latter. Jesus stated that the only way to salvation is through him so, with that being said, Christians are inclined to believe that acts alone will not get you into heaven. Likewise, the bible also states that faith without acts is, to paraphrase, not enough. So, really its a combination (with acts coming from the good-hearted nature of believing in Jesus) but without faith in Jesus, the Christian believes you are headed south for eternity.<br>  <br>  Again, most Christians feel this way - not all.<br>  <br>  P.S. - To "eastsidejim" - I hope you don't lose your faith in God based on the judgements of Christians. Although your lifestyle is considered a sin by the Bible's standards, nobody, and I mean NOBODY has the right to judge you. Don't give up on God based on humans!!|`|VncSMLMpaa	The Bible, God's inspired word, speaks of Jesus Christ, the son of God as the saviour, the promised Messiah.<br>  <br>  The Bible Scriptures teach repentance from our sins and the way it tells us to show this is by baptism. This is the baptism of Jesus whereby a person goes down into the water in a symbolic death to their old sinful way of life and up out of the water to a new way, a fresh start. Sprinkling water over someone is never an option in Scripture.<br>  It is compared to a person dying a garment, that garment has to go right into the water before coming out a lovely fresh colour. Sprinkle or dip it and you just get a mess.<br>  <br>  Baptism is all about starting a new life before God and trying to follow the faithful example of Jesus who did his Father's will completely. We may not be able to do as Jesus did but even if we sin we must repent and ask that our sins are blotted out. We ask through the name of Jesus, who sits at the right hand of his Father in heaven and mediates on our behalf.<br>  <br>  This business of heaven and hell in the way some churches state it is not very Biblical. We are told that heaven is God's throne and that Jesus has ascended to be with his Father. We are told the no one except Jesus has ascended yet the churches let people believe otherwise. Presumably  because it is like a comfort blanket and will keep them happy.<br>  <br>  Jesus said:<br>  John 3 <br>  13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, [even] the Son of man which is in heaven.  <br>  <br>  What people mistake is the Kingdom of heaven/the Kingdom of God and they say that they are in heaven but the parables Jesus uses to describe what it will be like are very earth based. For Revelation tells us the the Kingdom of God will be right here on a cleansed earth. This is also the message of the promises of the Old Testament.<br>  <br>  Hell is another thing that churches used to scare people witless about because they wanted a submissive people. Hell is the translation used for several ideas in the original Hebrew and Greek. The translators were somewhat influenced by what they had been taught.<br>  <br>  In the Bible concordances (Strong's and Young's) we can look up these words to see the original meaning which is very helpful often.<br>  <br>  Hell comes from words like Hades, Sheol and Gehenna.<br>  <br>  The first two just refer to the place of the dead, like the grave.

If we are truly born again believers, our actions will hopefully be motivated in love and in truth according to the word of God.<br>  <br>  It is not true that we get to heaven by being good.  We cannot work our way to heaven, but the signs and wonders will follow them that believe according to Mark 16:17.  We have to have the fruits of the spirit first before the signs.  So, what I'm saying is that we must be born again of the spirit and if we are led by the spirit we will be doing the right things.  The fruits of the Spirit are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness and self-control (Gal. 5:22-23).  If we are led by the Spirit we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh (Gal. 5:16).  Read Ephesians 2:8-10 also which tells us about grace and faith and that it is not by works of righteousness that we are saved.  We are saved first, and then the works follow.  also, read Titus 3:5 on this.  I hope you have a Bible.   Okay in case you can't find Titus will give you the verse:<br>  <br>  He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit.  Titus 3:5
KszocgnSaa	Umm a loving home is what matters the most but...well I'm ashamed to say this but I think have a mom and a dad may be better. It gives you more of a balance. Just as having a single parent is not as good. I completely understand where your coming from. Some kids are from bad homes tho and people want kids so if someone can give then a home why not? There are lots of gays that have great parenting skills and deserve to be parents. Ugh I feel so straight agreeing with you lol but really I think the balance is appreciated with children.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	No, what you're really saying, is it's better for kids to go from abusive foster home, to abusive foster home, never knowing what a parent is like, never knowing what it's like for anyone to give a sh*t about them, being teased in school. You're saying that is better than have 2 daddies. I'd rather be teased for having two daddies that love me, than having no one who gives a sh*t about me.|`|4kqvnQtUaa	I think that you may be worried if a child has 2 dads or 2 mons that there may be some Psych problems??

However If you think that a Mom & Dad for a "Home Life" if I may, You feel that both are better I think. Why some may say yes & some say No, I feel that no matter what Love is more important to a child, Not exactly a Mom & Dad Both. What can a mom do that a Dad can't? Or the other way..? Love is what is important, Not a "Tarditional" family. Love is the key to life.|`|54be3c7eda2a6643c24f8ad882a635d7aa	Whats best for the child is to have someone love them.

Now, I agree that having twice the support, meaning having two loving parents, is better. It doesn't matter if it's a same sex couple or not. As long as the child has someone to love them, and if it's two people, then it's twice the love. :P<br>  <br>  I don't understand why you think a child needs a parent of each gender.

That's what family life is about.

Here the child is exposed to having to pick and choose. Also, they go from two parents to one. It's a different situation because the child in the gay family still has two different role models. <br>  <br>  This is obviously just my opinion, but I hope it sparks some interest!|`|uRqm4Bxcaa	Here we go:<br>  <br>  The dangers and pitfalls associated with adoption are about equal between lgbt couples and straight couples.

If gay couples aren't allowed to adopt kids, that's that many more kids that are stuck in the bad situation that is group homes and being kicked out after graduating high school or becoming 18, whichever comes first. <br>  <br>  Everyone deserves to grow up with parents, and if the gay couple cared enough about the child to want to adopt him/her in the first place, then why shouldn't they be allowed to adopt? It's better than a foster home. The child will grow up with somebody caring for it and I can say as someone who's known people who've been adopted, most kids are grateful to know that somebody cared enough about them to want to adopt them in the first place, regardless if their adopted parents are gay or straight. What matters is whether or not the adopting parents are capable of supporting the child the way it deserves to be supported.|`|fG3hyBs0aa	What about 2 strong woman/ men it doesn't necessarily have to be a man && woman 2 be a strong positive influence!|`|lO5CCIB5aa	i think as long as thy have loving parents a a loving envirement theyll be happy|`|1hS27eJuaa	what angle, the fact that your basically saying children are better not having a home then having a single sex home.

Heck no that is not true. Americans are the most generous  and giving people of the world.  We have sent money and food to third world countries many, many years.  We have the best success rate in equality in the world,. Go to Mexico and if you are not from Mexico you are not treated equal. Here in the U.S. if you are from another country and not white you are treated equal.  I am sick and tired of these outright lies.|`|mLdlFhyqaa	I am guessing so.<br>  <br>  The vast majority of Americans have (historically) been discriminated against at some point.<br>  <br>  The English were the first, because they had been the former rulers of the Americans.  Many English settlers had to escape to Canada to avoid being tarred and feathered.<br>  <br>  Native Americans were the second.  Many of them were killed in the westward expansion of the United States.<br>  <br>  The Irish were the third.  This makes little sense, as Ireland was one of the founding fathers of the USA.<br>  <br>  Later, Germans, Italians, and Japanese were put against the wall (both literally and figuratively), due to their parts in WWII.<br>  <br>  Africans put up with a lot of stuff since they acheived freedom.  Only since the 1970s had they actually lived a somewhat equal life.<br>  <br>  Today, many people such as Africans feel they are entitled to a little revenge, and now the general European community in the USA is starting to feel the pinch of power.|`|AA10597919	There's racism everywhere around the world, sad to say.

If you mean by "the guys" as in your FRIENDS, well they should love you for who you are as a friend.

But if you mean as "the guys" as in every guy in school - that is not necessary|`|DSpbDItUaa	if there really your friends they'll still be your friend.just come out with it and your still a human so yeah.your not that different so just accept yourself and they should too hope it helps|`|aW5uShwtaa	People that won't accept you aren't worth being friends with anyway.|`|lCvJHS13aa	My guess if you have already told that many people, the other guys already know.

I know from experiance, that people are going to think what they're going to think.(I get gay bashed all the time, but I'm not gay) For you to be happy in your life you have to thicken your skin, and just go for it. The people who don't care about who you're interested in sexually, and can see you for you, are your true friends. And the people who hide behind they bible, and say you're not a good person, are wrong. Just be yourself kiddo. :]<br>  <br>  Also, If you know someone who's gay too (even an adult that you like) talk to them about it. The old gay men know so much about how to be comfortable with it. And the gay guys your age can definitely help you along the way.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|pVXecnmzaa	If you're sure that you're ready to tell them just go for it. If you have any doubts about it wait awhile, remember that once it's out, it's out and there's no turning back.<br>  <br>  Expect mixed reactions, some ppl won't mind while others make a big deal out of it. It's up to you to learn from the experience and to take it all in stride.|`|zrTxSysnaa	when i told the guys i was gay they were freaked out because they never met or knew a gay boy. it is really cool, b/c you can express yourself more freely.<br>  <br>  Quinncalhoun@att.net<br>  <br>  email me to hear my other experiences.<br>   anyone else can too.|`|wbfw04xPaa	Well if your in school still then you're going to get mixed reviews because most guys are going to insist that its gross.. and friends will follow. <br>  <br>  But overall if you're ok with coming out, then do it. Obviously your friends will still be there. <br>  <br>  Just tell your friends and everyone else will eventually find out. No need to go up to everyone and shake hands saying oh by the way i'm gay.. <br>  <br>  Good luck

The question on its face however doesn't leave many logical choices remaining as to why; specifically one race is to be avoided in this instance over another.<br>  The father may have had a bad experience that might explain his mistrust but I think we can agree, to lump all Hispanics into a group of undesirables would be ignorant on his part for there are many honest God fearing Mexicans. No single race has the monopoly on good values and trustworthiness and I believe that if the father hasn't taught his 16 year old the basics of lifes lessons, the morals and values of adulthood its a little too late to start now. Maybe the father should take an interest in his daughters friends and form a judgement based on what's inside and not get hung up on what he thinks he sees outside.

You don't need the word 'at' in this sentence.<br>  <br>   next sentence-   " Besides Japanese,,," (leave out 'the').....<br>  <br>  Should be - 'someone who speaks another language understands what I'm saying"<br>  <br>  Should be- "I not only learn about an individual person, but also about his or her culture"  No 's' on culture.  A lot of English speakers  would use 'their' in this sentence (most, in fact ), but technically it isn't correct, so say," his or her."  <br>  <br>  Should be history (not histories).<br>  <br>  Should be "It is probably because it sometimes ....." or "The reason is probably because it sometimes..." <br>  <br>  Actually, the way I would say this sentence is, "The reason is probably because history is about conflicts, compromises and wars and those things are so complicated they just  give me a headache."  <br>  You say that something "gives me a headache", or, " makes me have a headache".  <br>  <br>  I don't really understand what you mean by "I'm willing to go to the University one year and a few months later"  I don't think willing is the word you want to use.  The word willing implies a compromise, as in something you don't really want to do and are only' willing' to do for a short time.  I don't think that is what you mean. <br>    Also, I don't understand what you mean by":and a few months later."  Are you saying you want to start attending the university a little over a year from now?  Like in 15 months or something like that?  Here is how I would write that -<br>  "I want to start attending 000 University in slightly over a year, so I'm preparing for the tests now." (This is American English, by the way) <br>  The phrase "because it will later help me a lot "-  Actually, I think you need to fix that sentence.  What will it help you with later?  Do you mean that writing assignments in US History class will help you practice your writing for when you take journalism?  You need to be clearer on how, why it  will help you later.  <br>  I hope this helps.

tVA664IPaa	1. Well, obviously the LGBT community is involved in the issue. This includes PFLAG, HRC, GLAAD and other groups. Then there are churches and other religious groups such as the Knights of Columbus. ProtectMarriage.com is strongly against same-sex marriage. And obviously politicians are involved in the issue.<br>  <br>  2. Goodridge v. Mass. Department of Public Health (Massachusetts)<br>  <br>  3. Proposition 8 banned same-sex marriage in California. And every state in the United States except for Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Jersey either directly prohibits or does not offer the option of same-sex marriages of civil unions.<br>  <br>  4. I think this one is a matter of opinion. It certainly creates a line in the sand, if you ask me. It creates a class system. Heterosexuals are offered more rights than homosexuals.

AA11313798	Honestly, I wouldn't stress myself over it. Plus, you seem like a fine writer already.<br>  <br>  If you want, you can work on it, without straining yourself of course. Try reading the news everyday for the next few weeks. I read the news everyday just because it's interesting.<br>  <br>  I keep my webpage on Yahoo...so the news is always in front of me.<br>  <br>  Also, I would find practice tests online. I'm sure you can find them..just type up in the search engine...stuff like "language arts test" or "spelling and grammar practice test"...stuff like that.<br>  <br>  Their fun to take...just for fun. lol.<br>  <br>  Lastly, I'd go to www.freerice.com everyday. You get to test out your vocabulary skills. And for every right answer, you'd be helping them donate rice to third world countries. It can get a little addicting.<br>  <br>  But do read the news. Reading helps you build your skill because the grammar and manner of writing gets imprinted into your brain. You become a better writer because you can tell "what sounds right". <br>  <br>  Good luck on your test!|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Actually, spelling and grammar are part of being a great writer.  <br>  <br>  My biggest suggestion is to ask your teacher for tips on improving.  Then, hit the library and take out some books about English, such as Strunk and White's "Elements of Style".  "The Little Blue Book of English" will also give you tips on spotting your errors more quickly.  Other than that, you just need to study and practice.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

NSKimt1Qaa	I have gotten a check either my doctor's or dentist's office, I can't remember which because it was a long time ago, back when we had health insurance.

Hope you had a nice lunch!|`|AuKKjaxaaa	We got the same thing, only it was about $50, also from the dentist.  Insurance paid more than they expected.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Ha.. Hell no!

AA11997985	Once in chapter 11 - Stores do not have to accept gift cards<br>  The Sharper Image's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing publicized this issue - but sales of gift cards have not slowed down!<br>  <br>  Tens of millions of dollars in gift cards and certificates became worthless overnight in the wake of the Sharper Image's financial plight -- and customers holding those cards have little recourse. Federal law allows a company to stop honoring store gift cards when it files Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and that's exactly what happened at San Francisco-based Sharper Image. This event revealed the downside of popular and convenient store gift cards.<br>  <br>  Another example is Circuit City - though they are still taking cards. Check out this notice from CardAvenue " We will no longer allow the buying, selling, or trading of Circuit City Gift Cards due to their filing for bankruptcy and pending liquidation.<br>  <br>  Things are evolving quickly in this 2009 economy, but if you have a lot of gift cards then check out the bankruptcy security offers from Leveragecard.com and giftcardrescue.com.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/trade-giftcards#module16081252" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/trade-giftcards#m...</a>|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	yeah that's why i won't do it anymore, <br>  you might as well have thrown that money into the river,|`|NSKimt1Qaa	I would buy a gift card as a gift again, but I am more careful now when I purchase one.  I make sure that they don't have an expiration date because some do, or they start taking some money off it if they don't use it within 3 or 6 months.  I also think about how likely that particular store is to go out of business within the next year and whether the person I'm buying for is likely to use the gift card very soon.  I wouldn't want them holding it for too long as you never know anymore how long any store will be there.<br>  As for Visa gift cards - they have their flaws, too.  If you use it and leave a balance on it, it's up to you to keep track of how much is on it.  Most stores have no way of knowing, and if your purchase is even slightly over, it will be rejected.  It won't allow you to make up the difference with cash unless you know the exact balance left on the card.  Also, they have to be used within a certain time frame or they start subtracting money from it.|`|6aDXv5iVaa	I buy either Amex or Visa cards, as opposed to store-specific cards, allowing the recipient to shop where ever they'd like.|`|KIjjg3DJaa	Who are they and what are they doing?

If we give more preference to Worldly lusts.. its probably quite hard for us or impossible to leave everything when GOD asks to do so...<br>  There are many men of GOD who left everything and went on preaching GOD'S Word and they received everything in s double measure.<br>  <br>  You can never read BIBLE with a natural mind.... one need to have HOLY SPIRIT Guidance to perceive things written in the BIBLE.|`|NLinPsyhaa	Do you even know the context of that verse?

v4qLlGGhaa	I would have to argue against all marriage. It is destroying our government and single people are suffering (see the tax code).<br>  <br>  The word marriage should be abolished from state and federal governments. It is none of the government's business who sleeps with whom.<br>  <br>  Edit: Megan has a good answer but not all straight people can procreate. Some people are just infertile.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	Some arguments for being against gay marriage are:<br>  <br>  Having a brian tumor that alters your intelligence enough to be against gay marriage<br>  <br>  Having stupid parents<br>  <br>  Having a mental disorder/autism<br>  <br>  Being a moron<br>  <br>  Fear/Hate/homophobia<br>  <br>  Having a religion.|`|KBBonf97aa	One argument against it is that marriage started out as a religious institution defined as a union between a man and a woman, so gay marriage doesn't fit the definition.  If government hadn't decided to exploit the opportunity to use marriage for taxation and to control behavior, there wouldn't even be an issue.  The definition of an institution shouldn't have to change to accommodate changing social mores.<br>  <br>  That said, there's no way to get government out of people's lives, since it's firmly entrenched.  And while I don't want an institution I regard as religious, rather than legal (I don't think people should be required to notify the government about any personal commitments), to be redefined, I think the government should have an equivalent classification for gay couples that isn't called marriage.  But my inner libertarian wants no government involvement in personal relationships, whatsoever.|`|aW5uShwtaa	That would suck. You'll probably loose the debate.

Like I watched South Park, and seen this group called NAMBLA. Adult men wanting to have sex with consenting underage boys.. No one fights for them, if gay people can, they should be able to get married and have sex with each other. Even two underage kids can't get married or legally have sex.. and since i'm 15, that's a bunch of bull. Why can't i legally get some..|`|80ad9ec33d8120cc5f0cb14a6837b426aa	I know I am about to be criticized for my opinion but this is what I believe.

7EcoKxhlaa	Maybe it is an insurance issue. Maybe you can go through an agency that places volunteers and maybe their insurance could cover a potential injury at a store.

cWh9z8Bjaa	"I like to play tennis" sounds minutely more formal because the verb is not conjugated.  Their meaning is the same to me.|`|wW88dzhTaa	If you are on a tennis court you would probably say "I like playing tennis."<br>  If you are talking to someone at, say, school you would use B.<br>  <br>  Both are really acceptable in most situations. The infinitive "to play" may be considered slightly more formal, but "formal" isn't very easily defined in English.|`|7z1MIetkaa	well the first thing that comes to mind is that a) is like someone enjoys to play the game tennis and b) is like you said less exited about playing tennis but they enjoy the physical game part of it? i don't really know don't trust that answer, sorry, at least i tried|`|SzrP0wWPaa	I think A is more of a conditional tense<br>  "i like to play tennis if.."<br>  cant think of any other diff. =p|`|0zvan8K3aa	well they are just worded different, with a different sentence structure, like in a), is a infinitive phrase (you can tell by "to play") and b) is a gerund phrase (you can tell by -ing in "playing"), but to make it a simple answer, they would mean the same thing|`|ixhyTrvRaa	Truthfully, I don't see any difference that I think would really be a big deal. The person seems like they enjoy tennis. haha good luck!|`|HtHFHfDKaa	Like to play is describing What she/ he likes to do<br>  <br>  Like playing is describing the current action. <br>  <br>  I like to play would be the correct form.|`|s9zefBbvaa	Honestly, I think they are the same. They both imply that the person likes the game of tennis - the sentences are just worded differently. If you were going to emphasis that you strongly liked the game (more positive) then you might say, "I love to play tennis" or "I love playing tennis." If you wanted to make it clear that you like it, but don't "love" it, then you might say, "playing tennis is okay."
dz5Og81Qaa	There is no problem w/ this when the Will has been purified and is aligned w/ the Higher Will. The problem comes when the little selfish wills are in force. <br>  <br>  Crowley was a a great magician who is an example of what happens when you do not have pure or selfless intentions in your magic. You cannot run that kind of energy through your bodies (mental, emotional and physical) w/o there being an effect. It tends to overstimulate the personality which inflates the ego. He had great potential but misused it and allowed his ego and desires to run amok.<br>  <br>  Although I have associated w/ pagans for many years now this is still my problem w/ many of their practices.|`|M3Xmqlt8aa	Crowley was fashionable occultist, though he did some good with his Golden Dawn, in that he insisted on initaitic experience to move members up the ranks, a good deal of his public persona was garbage aimed at getting publicity. As for his law, it is just another polemic on Jewish law. The whole of humanity abides by it blindly, and Satanists take it to heart to justify being self centered. Crowley did not create any of it, he just made a perverted version of occult science public. He introduced a rather interesting Tarot spread, but I could care less about his Book of Thoth Deck, it does not provide anything worth while or better that the Waite Rider deck.|`|gHSarVD1aa	Oh boy... The Beast. The Master Theron or "whatever". I think he was the poster child for the Golden Dawn. I also think he wrote like 40 books filled with complete nonsense attempting to talk just above peoples intellect while tossing in a few rituals just to give the foolish people something to do after they bought his works. I back up this crass opinion with a paraphrased quote from the "Old Hag".<br>  "Mankind is like a deck of cards. Anyone with a little practice can make them do whatever they will."<br>  So let's cut to the chase of old Mr. Crowley.

vFQOAsUKaa	Judging from the email I get, there are a lot of people out there trying to learn about traditional Native American religion and spirituality these days. Many of them are trying to do this on the Internet.<br>  <br>  Now, there is a lot of garbage and misinformation on the Internet no matter what subject you're talking about, but American Indian religion and spirituality has got to have the worst signal-noise ratio of any of them. The 'information' out there about American Indian religions ranges from inaccurate school projects by seven-year- olds, to deeply biased generalizations about the 'heathens' written 300 years ago, to hucksters pretending to be Native American shamans to scam money off of people, to useful and interesting information about actual American Indian religious traditions past and present. Sorting through these sites can be a nightmare. I wish you a lot of luck with it. Before you start, let me give you a few words of experience.<br>  <br>  There are two reasons to be looking for information on Native American religions. The first, and easier to address, is educational. Either because you're a student who's been assigned to or just out of intellectual and cultural curiosity, you would like to learn more about how American Indians, or a particular tribe of American Indians, view the world. If that's you, then your main problem is going to be identifying the authentic and trustworthy sources. Indians are happy to talk about their beliefs and spiritual practices, both historically and in the modern day. Unfortunately, so are plenty of ill-informed non-Indians (or people of Indian descent) who think they know a lot more than they do. And so are those unscrupulous souls willing to pretend they're something they're not in hopes of making a buck or getting a little attention. My best recommendation is to get a Native American book out of the library as well as looking on the Internet, since any quack shaman can put up a website but it's a lot harder to publish a book. I also suggest ignoring and avoiding information about American Indian spirituality presented by anyone:<br>  <br>  1. Offering anything religious for sale. Money is never accepted by authentic holy people in exchange for Indian religious ceremonies like sweat lodges or sun dances, nor for religious items like medicine bags or smudged items. (They might sell arts and crafts, of course. Use your common sense--a devout Catholic might sell you a hand-carved crucifix to hang on your wall, for example, but he wouldn't sell communion wafers over the Internet or charge you admission to bring you to his church! Selling dreamcatchers or fetish carvings online is one thing, but don't believe information provided by anyone who is trying to charge people for smudging or blessing anything, making medicine, or letting them take part in a sweat lodge or dance. They are not authentic sources of information.)<br>  <br>  2. Inviting you into their religion on their webpage. Authentic Indians may seek to educate strangers online, but actually adopting an outsider as part of their culture is only done face-to-face and after knowing the person for some time.<br>  <br>  3. Claiming to be American Indian shamans , talking about tarot cards and Wiccan/pagan things, or talking about crystals and New Age things. I've got nothing against shamanism, paganism, or the New Age, but a cow is not a horse: none of these things are traditionally Native American. Shamanism is a Russian mystic tradition, Wicca is a religion based in pre-Christian European traditions, Tarot readings are an Indo-European divination method, and the New Age is a syncretic belief system invented, as its name suggests, in the modern era. None of them have anything to do with authentic Indian traditions, and anyone who thinks they do is likely to be wrong about anything else he claims about Native American religions as well. Wiccans and New Agers don't have any more knowledge about actual American Indian beliefs than you do.<br>  <br>  4. Identifying only as 'Native American' or 'American Indian' (an authentic person would list their actual tribal affiliation). Be a little wary, too, of people trying to speak with authority who identify as "mixed-blood" or "of Indian descent" or having a "Cherokee ancestor." There are certainly some mixed-blood people who were raised in their tribe's culture, but many more were not. A person who has rediscovered his Indian heritage as an adult is a seeker, not a teacher. He is not qualified to speak authoritatively about Native American religion or culture, for he wasn't raised that way and doesn't have any more knowledge about it than anyone else learning about it second-hand--including you.<br>  <br>  If you're trying to learn about American Indian religion because you want to become a part of it, though, you not only face that problem, but another, much deeper one as well: American Indian spirituality is not evangelistic. It is private and entirely cultural. You cannot convert to 'Native American' any more th|`|p6ULsFDLaa	Research your family history,contact the Nations OWN geneologists,reconnect with your families nation and learn from THIER recognised elders IF and thats a big IF,they are willing to teach you.Too many folks confuse it with "religion"rather than a way of life that is race specific and unique to each Nation,Band and or community.|`|64Fnc1Foaa	you cant bud. why would you|`|AA11124121	if you aren't in the Tribe..you stand virtually no chance.

What many people fail to understand is that slavery in biblical times was very different from the slavery that was practiced in the past few centuries in many parts of the world. The slavery in the Bible was not based exclusively on race. People were not enslaved because of their nationality or the color of their skin. In Bible times, slavery was more a matter of social status. People sold themselves as slaves when they could not pay their debts or provide for their families. In New Testament times, sometimes doctors, lawyers, and even politicians were slaves of someone else. Some people actually chose to be slaves so as to have all their needs provided for by their masters.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	The entire world was enslaved to Satan, sin,and death throughout the entire Old Testament, from the fall of man until the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  What man knew as slavery was simply a manifestation of that supernatural reality.<br>  <br>  Once the Church got established, the first thing it did was begin to free slaves, and treat them as equals, in the eyes of both God and man.<br>  <br>  So, God never condoned slavery.

Since Jesus paid the price for our salvation, those who were waiting for him came alive.  This is one of the signs.

The second is, "by whom?". The third is, "how often has this been edited during the ensuing centuries?"<br>  <br>  Only the first question has anything like a definite answer and this is some hundreds of years after Jesus' time! <br>  <br>  We do know that Mathew's Gospel has been severely edited more than once and the original content is now very unclear and uncertain.<br>  <br>  Something of the sort may well have happened but you must also bear in mind that such is far from being a rare event (apart from the earthquake, that is). It is a frequent occurrence that those who have left their last body visit friends and relatives to let them know that all is well and that life is wonderful once one passes through the illusion of death. <br>  <br>  So, in short, nothing unusual and nothing that relates specifically to christianity. <br>  <br>  Blessed be<br>  <br>  Karma Singh|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	Mat 27:52  And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, <br>  Mat 27:53  And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many. <br>  <br>  <br>  after jesus was raised from the dead so were these dead  saints raised from the dead and went into the city of jerusalem and appeared to many people.

A bunch of people are resurrected and no one wrote anything about it.  Hmmm.  I've got one for you since your THE atheist's atheist on R&S:<br>  <br>  Atheists say that man conceived (i.e., made up) God.  Talk about things that should be written about.  Throughout human history, all the big turning point moments are documented who, what, when, why, and where.  Atheists say that we came to be, lived, and will die without there being a God.  They say that God was made up.  But when you check the logs on all of human history, there has ALWAYS been talk of God.  ALWAYS!!!  <br>  <br>  You're convinced that dead people didn't arise because no one wrote about it?  Well, I'm convinced God wasn't made up because NO ONE ever wrote about who first floated this notion of a God, when, why, where, etc.<br>  <br>  I mean, the Bible makes it clear that God came first.  If you look at the writings of human history that's precisely how it appears.  God is always there, always matter-of-factly dealt with.  Not even a peep about how SOME people claim there is no God but THIS FACTION says there is.<br>  <br>  Now take your drill and stick it you know where.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	It was the first resurrection of the dead.

And, I am not unique by any means, I know many Montreals and Quebecers who speak beautiful French.<br>  <br>  French is taught in schools in Montreal.  However, teachers will discuss the differences between French from various other countries and they will also discuss "Joual", which is the name given specifically to the Quebec French spoken in Montreal.  They will also discuss "Magoua", the French spoken in Trois-Rivières and "Chaouin", which is spoken south of Trois-Rivières. <br>  <br>  Originally "Joual" French was associated with the working class population but Sovereinty has changed that.<br>  <br>  Like with the dialect of other languages, French "dialects" should not be looked down upon.  They are part of the heritage of French Canada and should be respected as such and protected for future generations.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your move to Montreal, it is a beautiful, warm, fun city...I'm sure you will not have any problems understanding the language and being understood.<br>  <br>  For Frenchy: Please read carefully.  I realize the French Canadian accent is different from Parisian French...then again, Parisian French is different from French spoken in other cities of France and other French speaking countries.  My response was concerning the French taught in class, which is just plain French.  Joual is not taught in classes in Montreal. Joual used to be the French of the street, the spoken language.  Even that has changed now.<br>  <br>  I lived in Montreal for 35 years.|`|MDqRePLraa	Yes, I'm French, & I can tell you one thing: They definitely don't speak the same French as us.

Jesus (peace be upon him) is going to lead the biggest war in history known to men. He will fight the Dajjal al Meseeh's (The False Messiah) army along with the Muslims and other believers from different faiths. Then the whole world be asked by who, to convert or die, WHO?<br>  <br>  Follow the prophet's words, not the words people themselves made up. I am not saying the Quran doesn't say to slay "nonbelievers", as you put it.<br>  <br>  "Fight in the cause of God those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for God loves not transgressors. And slay them wherever ye catch them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out; for tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter; but fight them not at the Sacred Mosque, unless they (first) fight you there; but if they fight you, slay them. Such is the reward of those who suppress faith. But if they cease, God is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevails justice and faith in God; but if they cease, let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression" (2:190-193).<br>  <br>  See, there is limits on the concept of Jihad. The verses tell to only fight in Allah's name, that is what makes Jihad so special. It is like what Islam does to slavery, by putting a HUGE limit on it. Allah does not like transgressors (people who takes things to far). If they stop to fight, the Muslims can no longer fight them, out of Allah's mercy. Also, only show hostility to those who practice oppression (the ones who don't let Muslims act like Muslims). What is the point of someone oppresses your faith. Isn't living by faith th point of this life? <br>  <br>  War is a horribly and messy business, but Allah knows everything. He knows of the wars of Mankind before they happen. Allah t'ala  told his believers the way to have war, when it is needed, in the most proper way. We all know all faiths go to war. Look at America, a country of Muslims, Jews, Christians, Indians, and even atheists. Supply it runs on Christian ideals. Are you going to say Christians have nothing to do with wars such as the Crusades, which they started, saying things such as:<br>  <br>  "But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me" (Luke 19:27). <br>  <br>  Jesus and Muhammad (pace be upon them) were both Muslims, but the last word came to Muhammad (peace and God's blessing be upon him) alone.  Actually, there are arguments on which Buddha is Dhul-Kifl of the Quran, a man of great patience.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	E.T.

So if you use homology you could say that like things are evidence of a creator because the creator borrowed parts from one design and put them in another. If you use homology to prove evolution you can think that they are similar because of a common ancestor. So homology just means that they are created by the same creator. So God made monkeys.

RGe6Et0Xaa	If you want to know more about Christianity, ask a theologian, priest, pastor, or minister. Or go to official documents put out by Christian denominations, or read books published by Christian groups.<br>  <br>  The last thing you should do is get info from people on an anonymous internet forum.|`|AA10945101	I would say that if you want to learn more about Jesus then the person you should ask is Jesus. <br>  <br>  ...and you should start by thanking him for giving you such obvious signals regarding whom you should NOT be consulting to learn about him.  Think about it....if a person gets impatient or defensive when you ask questions, or it they can only offer vague, repetitive statements (mantras) then they obviously don't have anything of value to share with you.  I'm not saying anything about the validity of what they believe, but if they don't demonstrate the characteristics Jesus said they needed (patience, humility, love, compassion, etc...), they don't have the ability to communicate it to you...at least not yet!  <br>  <br>  ...but back to the main question...I would advise you to ask Jesus to reveal the truth to you, and then take your pure, simple and honest heart (love that description BTW) and read about what Jesus actually said and did in the bible.  Focus on the gospels (I'd start with John)...and allow that pure, simple heart to temporarily ignore anything you might already know about what the rest of the bible says about anything!...focus on learning about Jesus.<br>  <br>  When you have questions, ask other believers what they think, and simply ignore those that respond defensively or don't provide an answer.  Look for those that are willing and able to offer an answer and then identify answers that are consistent with your assumption that there is a truth to be found in the message of Jesus. <br>  <br>  ...a parting thought...do you perhaps think it should be easy to discover the truth about something this important?  Jesus offered eternal life.  That's not exactly a treasure you'll find at the bottom of a box of cereal.  I've been searching for the truth in "Christianity" (meaning the truth in the message of Jesus) for 30+ years and while I found enough truth to eliminate any doubts it isn't true some time ago, I still discover new truths every time I seek answers to new questions in the life and message of Jesus.|`|jcZnIR1Zaa	If you truly have questions, I will answer them as fully as I can.   <br>  <br>  You may be getting partial or incomplete answers because you are posting questions on an open forum where pretty much anybody who can type will try to get a few words in.

I have vowed to You what (the child that) is in my womb to be dedicated for Your services (free from all worldly work; to serve Your place of worship), so accept this from me. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knowing."<br>  <br>  [003:036] Then when she gave birth to her [child Maryam (Mary)], she said: "O my Lord! I have given birth to a female child," – and Allah knew better what she brought forth, – "And the male is not like the female, and I have named her Maryam (Mary), and I seek refuge with You (Allah) for her and for her offspring from Shaitan (Satan), the outcast."<br>  <br>  [003:037] So, her Lord (Allah) accepted her with goodly acceptance. He made her grow in a good manner and put her under the care of Zakariyya (Zechariah). Every time he entered Al-Mihrab to (visit) her, he found her supplied with sustenance. He said: "O Maryam (Mary)! From where have you got this?" She said, "This is from Allah." Verily, Allah provides sustenance to whom He wills, without limit.<br>  <br>  [003:038] At that time Zakariyya (Zechariah) invoked his Lord, saying: "O my Lord! Grant me from You, a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation."<br>  <br>  [003:039] Then the angels called him, while he was standing in prayer in Al-Mihrab (a praying place or a private room), (saying): "Allah gives you glad tidings of Yahya (John), confirming (believing in) the Word from Allah [i.e. the creation of 'Eesa (Jesus) ['alayhis-salam], the Word from Allah ("Be!" – and he was!)], noble, keeping away from sexual relations with women, a Prophet, from among the righteous."<br>  <br>  [003:040] He said: "O my Lord! How can I have a son when I am very old, and my wife is barren?" (Allah) said: "Thus Allah does what He wills."<br>  <br>  [003:041] He said: "O my Lord! Make a sign for me." (Allah) said: "Your sign is that you shall not speak to mankind for three days except with signals. And remember your Lord much (by praising Him again and again), and glorify (Him) in the afternoon and in the morning."<br>  <br>  [003:042] And (remember) when the angels said: "O Maryam (Mary)! Verily, Allah has chosen you, purified you (from polytheism and disbelief), and chosen you above the women of the 'Aalam?n (mankind and jinn) (of her lifetime)."<br>   <br>  [003:043] "O Maryam (Mary)! Submit yourself with obedience to your Lord (Allah, by worshipping none but Him Alone) and prostrate yourself, and bow down along with Ar-Rak?'?n (those who bow down)."<br>  <br>   <br>  [003:044] This is (a part) of the news of the Ghaib (Unseen, i.e. the news of the past nations of which you have no knowledge) which We reveal to you (O Muhammad [sal-Allahu 'alayhi wa sallam]). You were not with them, when they cast lots with their pens as to which of them should be charged with the care of Maryam (Mary); nor were you with them when they disputed.<br>  <br>  [003:045] (Remember) when the angels said: "O Maryam (Mary)! Verily, Allah gives you the glad tidings of a Word ["Be!" – and he was! i.e. 'Eesa (Jesus) the son of Maryam (Mary)] from Him, his name will be the Messiah '?sa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), held in honour in this world and in the Hereafter, and will be one of those who are near to Allah."<br>  <br>  [003:046] "He will speak to the people, in the cradle and in manhood, and he will be one of the righteous."<br>  <br>  [003:047] She said: "O my Lord!

The Bible is not intended to be a stand-alone text.  The Bible should be read attentively and frequently,  but also in communion with The Church that assembled it. <br>  <br>  I recommend The New Jerusalem Bible.  It is a beautifully translated English language Bible that includes all the parts that many other bibles - such as the King James Version, deleted only a few centuries ago.   The other translation I recommend is the New American Bible,  but in my opinion that is not as enjoyable to read.   They are both complete and accurate translations,  but I think The New Jerusalem Bible is translated in English so well that it actually encourages a person to read more.<br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic.  You could contact any Catholic Church for guidance.  Parish priests can be very busy, but I'm sure any priest would find time to talk with you.   If you genuinely seek the Truth, you will find the Truth.   <br>  <br>  I recommend you pray for guidance from God every time your read The Bible or The Catechism of the Catholic Church.<br>  Peace be with you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:   You could also try   ewtn.com   and   catholic.com.<br>  Remember that Christianity began almost 2000 years ago.|`|KILFoc6kaa	Start with the bible, then some personal meditation on what you are reading.

It's not obviously anything but a confirmation bias.<br>  <br>  You already have it in your head that the LDS church is some restored, primitive Christian church and so you naturally draw any parallels you can find between the LDS and 1st century Christians.<br>  <br>  <br>  How do you account for the Missionaries at Utah Boys Camp (where I had the misfortune of attending for 6 years)? These missionaries, sent there by your church, witnessed physical, psychological, religious, and sexual abuse at the hands of the counselors and board members and did nothing about it. They just continued feeding us your vile, racist bull crap from the Book of Mormon hoping that this very sick form of "tough love" would "fix us troubled young men".<br>  <br>  <br>  Your religion is disgusting, and an insult to anyone with half a thinking brain.

qJkRPhIKaa	we evolve plenty. We are evolving in the mind. We are seeking better technologys and are trying to find out about the space and what is on other planets. If you compare that to the medieval ages where we fought with swords and the toughest question was "is the planet flat or round" then you will see we have evolved from that. Natural selection happens to allow a species to get requirements to survive over others. For instance a wolf chasing deer for food would need long legs instead of short ones.<br>  <br>  Natural selection would give them long legs. <br>  <br>  This sort of thing happens over thousands(even millions) of years.

That is not how it works.|`|1c0f793db881cd47badc0d00bd5bd1caaa	Why do you presume to think think you do, I assume this is some kind of preemptive strike against atheists, and as one i will say that I know when you hit the switch on the wall the light comes on, I know nothing about electrical engineering but I do know that it isn't created by a load of pixies with little candles inside the bulb.  The point is that without having a degree in anthropology, genetics or even general science I know that with a visit to a library I can read evidence which supports Darwin's theories.  On the other hand there is absolutely no evidence other than some old testament gibberish to support creationism, it is therefore pathetic in the extreme to attack atheists for not knowing the general theories of evolution chapter and verse.   Does the average driver know how an engine and gearbox works, even the stupidest knows it isn't by magic and, as an observation, stupidity isn't restricted to christianity!|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Modern medicine removes many but not all selection pressures.

Our immune systems are evolving with all the viruses. An example is back in the 1920's with the flu. It was killing people all over the place, and all of a sudden it stopped killing people after years. That is because the people with stronger immune systems were able to survive and withstand the virus. That shows that the people with the fittest immune systems lived. There was no antidote for the virus either. Electron microscopes, which werent invented for 20 years after, are the only way we can see the viruses|`|oBXiigEoaa	Natural selection is still at work. Not every human who is born will pass on his or her DNA. Plenty of children die before ever getting the chance to reproduce.

You need both to figure out which countries are growing, not improving and/or evolving. Evolution happens over hundred of thousands of years. Evolution can even be seen if you travel to a preserved colonial home, the doorways are shorter than now days... it's because people even less than 300 years ago were shorter! Now please don't tell me that it's Intelligent Growing!|`|AA12351337	You answered your own question.<br>  "Only the fittest survive."  This means out of ALL the species on the planet.  We are the dominant species on Earth.  So we are the fittest in a way.  I'm not trying to sound all cool and the best, I'm just pointing something out.  We are still evolving.  Evolution also means that a species, all species, adapt to their surroundings (so, also adaption).  Which we do.  But it takes millions of years.  <br>  Example, Polar Bears were probably not originally white.  They might have been like every other bear.  But they lived in the Artic, so in order to get food, they had to blend in with their surroundings, which is white.<br>  We won't devolve any time soon.|`|9f7328923e8ee8bd543f1c4b68806f3faa	If you want a good answer on evolution, you should ask your question in the biology section. The environment is continuously changing, and will exert selective pressure on human populations. The Japanese are becoming taller, and the Hawaiian and native Americans are now resistant to smallpox. Global warming will affect the Eskimos. If they cannot adapt to a new environment, they will become extinct.|`|SPNHhFXoaa	We are smarter than we were fifty years ago, are we not(well some of us are)?<br>  <br>  STRELOK- Remember, Gravity is only a theory too...<br>  <br>  <br>  "Kitty Kat the more westernised the country the lower the birth rate'<br>  <br>  I actually consider that a bit of a good thing.

Simple you cannot de-age a person and make them go from 10 to 5 (at the moment) and time cannot be reversed at all so in all devolving is actually impossible because humans can evolve to match similar strength and body of a being back in the chain, but the thing that bring us forward in the chain is one this and that is only one thing...

We are still evolving because we keep getting new mutations in our genomes with each generation.  However, because of technology and society today, it's harder for any certain group of a population to really become more advanced than the others.  Natural selection is not occurring.<br>  <br>  I suppose you could argue that it still is though; for example, the wealthy, prosperous, and successful families in let's say New York or London will have a better chance at living and reproducing than let's say the average family in poverty-stricken India.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Let us remember that Darwin was 150 years behind our time.  There were things he believed about evolution that have been proven false today.  He wasn't the "almighty God" of evolution.<br>  <br>  Evolution does not revolve around natural selection.  It's simply a means; not the only one.  You can have humans select which breeds or races will continue.  This is called eugenics.  Our financial systems will also advance certain people further into newer generations; this is not natural.

It was seven in the morning by the old clock on the wall and the temperature at the bank said 41 degrees. I put my clothes into the machine then was startled by a foot that moved between the rows of machines. I knew that this was a hang out for the homeless people so I was not real surprised having lived that life when I was younger. When I went to investigate my shock was I could hardly tell what I saw was human much less male or female. Upon a closer look she resembled a sack of wrinkled flesh wearing only a tee shirt that she had pulled over her head to block out the light. She lay there upon the cold concrete floor shivering, naked. <br>     A repair man enters the store to fix some of the broken machines working on the machine next to the one I was using. I mentioned that we have a visitor this morning pointing to the little old lady who looked as if she were in her 70s. I was on my way out to my van to get her a sleeping bag. I always try to carry two, one for me and one for someone in need. Looking at the old woman he with shaking body and voice announced “They choose to live that kind of life” I noticed how upset he was as he went on that we should not care about them. I had to fuel his fire a bit by saying, “yes even so she is still probably someone’s Grandmother. Well that must have hit home because he was trembling and almost talking to himself at least I was no longer listening to him as I walked over to see if she was ok. She with appreciative eyes told me that she had washed her clothes in the sink but had no money to dry them thanking me for the sleeping bag. I put money into the dryer for her and she covered herself and went back to sleep. <br>    A woman enters the room and ignores everything that is going on as if she had blinders on rendering it impossible to see anything but the dryer she came to use. <br>     The repairman with his hand violently shaking had his cell phone rattling against his ear calling the owner of the business. Sometime later the buzzer goes off on the dryer announcing her clothes were dry as the owner storms onto the scene. Get out of my shop he screamed at her using language that one would not use in front of your Grandmother. She dressed herself as modestly as she could and left with head hung low. <br>     I believe when you see someone naked clothe them, when hungry feed them, when sick heal them, within your ability to do so. <br>     Pity goes to those who wrestle with their conscience and lose.|`|hR3AE1ARaa	a good haiku always gets me off
ixFbNr4taa	From the Wiki.....<br>  <br>  Hadrian and the military<br>  Despite his own great stature as a military administrator, Hadrian's reign was marked by a general lack of major military conflicts, apart from the Second Roman-Jewish War. He surrendered Trajan's conquests in Mesopotamia, considering them to be indefensible. There was almost a war with Parthia around 121, but the threat was averted when Hadrian succeeded in negotiating a peace.<br>  <br>  The peace policy was strengthened by the erection of permanent fortifications along the empire's borders (limites, sl. limes). The most famous of these is the massive Hadrian's Wall in Great Britain, and the Danube and Rhine borders were strengthened with a series of mostly wooden fortifications, forts, outposts and watchtowers, the latter specifically improving communications and local area security. To maintain morale and keep the troops from getting restive, Hadrian established intensive drill routines, and personally inspected the armies. Although his coins showed military images almost as often as peaceful ones, Hadrian's policy was peace through strength, even threat. <br>  <br>  Second Roman-Jewish War  (See also: Bar Kokhba revolt)<br>  In 130, Hadrian visited the ruins of Jerusalem, in Judaea, left after the First Roman-Jewish War of 66–73. He promised to rebuild the city, but in doing so renamed it Aelia Capitolina after both himself and Jupiter Capitolinus, the chief Roman deity. A new temple dedicated to the worship of Jupiter was also built on the ruins of the old Jewish Second Temple, which had been destroyed in 70.  In addition, Hadrian abolished circumcision, which was considered by Romans and Greeks as a form of bodily mutilation and hence "barbaric". <br>  <br>  These anti-Jewish policies of Hadrian triggered in Judaea a massive Jewish uprising, led by Simon bar Kokhba and Akiba ben Joseph. Following the outbreak of the revolt, Hadrian called his general Sextus Julius Severus from Britain, and troops were brought from as far as the Danube. Roman losses were very heavy, and it is believed that an entire legion, the XXII Deiotariana was destroyed.  Indeed, Roman losses were so heavy that Hadrian's report to the Roman Senate omitted the customary salutation "I and the legions are well".  <br>  <br>  However, Hadrian's army eventually put down the rebellion in 135, after three years of fighting. According to Cassius Dio, during the war 580,000 Jews were killed, 50 fortified towns and 985 villages razed. The final battle took place in Beitar, a fortified city 10 km. southwest of Jerusalem. The city only fell after a lengthy siege, and Hadrian did not allow the Jews to bury their dead. According to the Babylonian Talmud, after the war Hadrian continued the persecution of Jews. He attempted to root out Judaism, which he saw as the cause of continuous rebellions, prohibited the Torah law, the Hebrew calendar and executed Judaic scholars (see Ten Martyrs). The sacred scroll was ceremonially burned on the Temple Mount. In an attempt to erase the memory of Judaea, he renamed the province Syria Palaestina (after the Philistines), and Jews were forbidden from entering its rededicated capital.

But, your good decisions will not come close to paying off the debt of sin, you was born into. <br>  <br>   Would you drink water from a barrel with a single drop of toxic waste? <br>  Would you fly a space shuttle with a tiny pin sized hole? <br>  <br>  We are not Perfect(Holy), so we cannot come into God's presence. However, God took the form of a person and payed off our huge debt of sin. So all you have to do is accept the gift and you're sinless.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	Yes. Please read this carefully. All have sinned, and cannot stand in the prescence of God. The only way a person can go to heaven is through Jesus. Jesus said "I am the way, the truth and the life, nobody can go to the father except by me". But he explained more. He said that anyone that tries to get to the Father without Him is like a thief or a robber.  The reason this is so important, and I hope you are paying attention is this:  Is what Jesus did on the cross not good enough for you? He went through excruciating pain, and suffering, and took on your sins, and shame. God did everything he could to make it so that man would not perish, and as a free gift to man he gave his only Son who he loved to die in your place. So when you get to heaven, there is only one thing that can save you, and that's reliance only on the blood of Jesus, and not good works. Your works are as filthy rags to God. Jesus  was ressurected by God because he is sinless. You cannot be ressurected without Jesus. Also, you need to be born again in order to enter heaven. Sin results in spiritual death. So you need to be born again. So many people don't realise that they are slapping God in the face when they reject Jesus. So believe, and read the Bible so that you can know about Jesus and his love for you. If you love Jesus then he cannot condemn you.|`|tvHM7hdDaa	I can't judge you. Neither can anyone else on this website. Just a lot of atheist's telling you how to run life. Same with Christians. Most of us tell you what to do. You make your own decisions. Live your life. I would want you to go to a church some time but I could care less if you didn't.|`|D4LnRg2Daa	Try it Trvor and let me know how that works out.  Just kidding.

Bravo! <br>  I would like to ask a humble question in response to your question though.<br>  <br>  Why pray tell, would you ask such a question in a religion and spirituality answer forum?|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	morals are of the highest importance for men ,not for god. no better to live  in a moral virtuous world without a god than an evil hell on earth with a god.|`|2C8U7Itqaa	No, in fact one may lead a "richer" life.|`|78VY1OiHaa	There's absolutely nothing wrong with living the life you describe. I think you'd fit in any society and be well-liked and respected for the way you live your life, not for your beliefs about the afterlife. And since humanity is the only source of law and morality that we know definitely exists, who cares what judgmental believers think?|`|mCF4wGjdaa	Hi Trvor,<br>  if you live your life that way then you are following the advice of God for this is the way in which the universe actually functions. You have aligned yourself with God's will for you and so you reap the rewards of doing so.<br>  <br>  Organised religion usually gets in the way of doing this and prevents their followers "obeying the will of god". It's a good idea not to believe them. By their fruits shall ye know them is all that is relevant here. Notice the hate with which the "believers" are damming you for the "crime" of not obeying their mental slave masters.<br>  <br>  Keep doing it and your passage back to Heaven will be an easy one.<br>  <br>  Blessed be<br>  <br>  Karma Singh|`|FATyhyZ2aa	Nope, not in this life. But why choose to settle for just a good life when you could have "life, and that abundantly."  And then have life again after death b/c you had accepted the gift of Salvation (thru the Son of the self existing living God) & could be translated to a Spirit-being that never knows sorrow or pain while actively participating in creation projects beyond wonders you could imagine. / If YHWH is your Father, you join the Family business.  He's a Creator.  There's no floating on clouds w/ harps.  There's much to be done & when you will look and see that "it is good."  IMAGINE!|`|ktsPCsBjaa	there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.<br>  <br>  i DO believe in God and i believe he won't hold it against you that you don't believe. if you're a good person at heart and are doing good things than you are doing what God asked you to do, even if you don't know it.<br>  <br>  so don't listen to the people who say you won't be saved, because you will, if you really are a good person.|`|Aa6XHuENaa	I'm content with my life.<br>  <br>  And no, there is nothing wrong with it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Pinkstealth:<br>  <br>  Are you aware that east and west meet on the other side of the world?  It's all relative and statements like the one you just made only highlight your ignorance.|`|akwVAZcEaa	People can live any way they want.<br>  That's what most people do and most people think they are doing good.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, this life is all they'll get because, without following Jesus and His Commandments, there will only be extermination for them at judgement.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, those who do follow God, Jesus and obey the Commandments will live forever.<br>  <br>  The choice is always ours.|`|59fZ25iDaa	It is possible and without knowing it may be discovering your faith. This gives me great faith.<br>  <br>  Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.|`|PS6Pjtndaa	Is there anything wrong with that?  LOL!<br>  <br>  I wish I knew you better so that I could better personalize an analogy.  Since I don't, I'll just have to grab one out of thin air.  Here goes:<br>  <br>  Society has rules.  There are federal laws, state laws, city laws, ordinances, etc.  Everyone understands that like it or not, thems the rules.  <br>  <br>  So, would you ask: Is there anything wrong with living your life with good morals and being an overall good person and still not believe in laws, and still be content with your life?<br>  <br>  At some point, SURELY you see that your total disregard with the laws will almost certainly guarantee that you'll run afoul of the law.  Right?  What are you going to say?  But ... but ... I'm a good person!  <br>  <br>  No ... the question is did you or didn't you break the law.<br>  <br>  God has rules too.  I frankly don't care whether you like it or not.  God is bigger than any of us and His rules are too.  Just like the law!  You're saying in effect: I have NO IDEA what God considers to be a good person.  I'm just going to live for myself.  Is that okay?  Well, as far as your concerned it probably is, just like in the law analogy, it was.  You got in trouble when the law came after you, NOT when you had second thoughts about the law.  The same is true for God.  He has rules that you don't know and you don't care about.  You're asking us to give you a free pass to continue to ignore them.  That's all well and good, except we can't!  We're under the same rules!<br>  <br>  So, I would ask you how good are you?  Here are some examples from God's rules:<br>  <br>  1. Do you love your neighbors as yourself?<br>  <br>  2. Have you ever taken the Lord's name in vain?<br>  <br>  3. Do you love your enemies?<br>  <br>  4. Do you love the Lord with all of your heart and soul?<br>  <br>  5. Do you pray?<br>  <br>  6. Do you ever gossip or think mean thoughts?<br>  <br>  7. Do you ever make any situations worse by egging people on, being spiteful, or failing to take the high road?<br>  <br>  8. Are you ever slow to forgive?<br>  <br>  9. Do you ever turn a blind eye and a cold heart away from suffering?<br>  <br>  10. Do you know Jesus as your personal Lord and savior?<br>  <br>  These are just a few examples of God's rules.  If you aren't doing ALL of these and all of the other rules too then you've sinned.  Even one sin that isn't forgiven is sufficient to doom you to hell.  And you want me to lie to you that your own standard of goodness is good enough?  It's only good enough to you!  <br>  <br>  God plays by His own rules and His arm is longer than the fabled long arm of the law.  <br>  <br>  For a complete listing of God's standards and expectations please consult your nearest Holy Bible.<br>  <br>  Lord bless.|`|u2BVwAKNaa	Of coarse <br>  <br>  Religion is superstitious nonsense..|`|QrBReRQbaa	There is nothing wrong with that and everything right about that.|`|45Mmu3SFaa	Nothing is wrong with that, to each his own...

All I can say is from my perspective just because one chooses not to believe in God doesn't mean he doesn't exist but that's a choice each of us as individuals have to make. As for me I am more concerned about being content where I'm going and not so much where I am.|`|Xz2R8R1Maa	Only if the interpretation of "wrong" is "ignoring what the Bible says to do."

30b80549ef581ba10302258d8ca2bfbaaa	i think so many cops view us that way. they say that its specific but i cant tell you how many times ive been driving out in the county (not even the city) and been pulled over. one of my friends (black guy) was actually arrested. for no reason they just said he was suspect. this kid never did anything against the grain in his entire life. thats just one of many cases. <br>  <br>   so when you start profiling people like that you may claim consciously that it is only a target group but in reality (i think) you do see us all that way. it isnt something you can control if you indulge in prejudice and hate. its almost habitual after a while. i dont really like that kind of attitude toward any group of people. like it seems as though they see you as inferior if your from a poorer area. thats not how i was raised you know? i worked with a couple ex-cops at my dads job over the summer before i started college this year. i had conversations with them because im just that bold girl who cant keep her mouth shut. i told them about how i hating the racial profiling annd the way they see people. the only defense they had was the stereotypical "crime ridden ghettos" speech. then i started talking about how i had a lot of white friends who steal, deal drugs (a lot actually lol), etc. and they never get caught. i have family members who are/have been locked up for **** that my ex bfs have gotten away with because theyre from upper middle class families and unlike those neighborhoods they dont have cops patrolling the streets trying to bust people for petty **** instead of finding ways to crack down on the sky rocketing homicide rates in places like baltimore. ugh. <br>  <br>  so yes i am offended. thats a stereotype ive had to fight all my life simply because im black and im tired of it. <br>  <br>  BTW. im in new york for school now but im from baltimore too<br>   : ]<br>  but im from mount washington though so yeah...not exactly the ghetto lol i have family everywhere though from the projects to the suburbs.|`|AS4RZKY3aa	I don't care about the cops because i do not get involved with them.<br>  <br>    The police enjoy killing black people and shooting black men for fun.

The cop obviously doesn't understand how and why the negihborhood came to be that way nor does he possess a sense of compassion or intellect to understand his own bigotry.  That black ghetto (neighborhood) that the author describes in this story is no different than any other predominately african-american community where these type of activities and downtrodden circumstances exist.  <br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, speaking as an african-american, I'm not offended by the cop's feelings because "I" understand the nature of this "ghetto" and how it got that way, historically, socially and economically.  If the cop in this story understood these elements the way I do, then he wouldn't hate the people that reside there at all; however, he'd possess an understanding of how things came to be that way, instead of being ignorant and saying blanket statements, like I hate these black people in this ghetto.<br>  <br>  It's only through acquiring the knowledge of the history of something that we're able to appreciate and understand how anything develops.  <br>  <br>  Khafre<br>  <br>  <br>  Besides, how can anyone who's ignorant offend me!|`|XeelPs6Waa	Hate doesn't produce the best results in any situation.|`|HimBbU6caa	I don't like cops who act like thugs and commit criminal acts.

xbw8P3Rsaa	"If religion is so true?<br>  How come people aren't born with it??<br>  <br>  You would think that God would have planted that seed in your head.."<br>  <br>  In a sense, the search for 'god' is planted in our heads.  From the second vatican council:<br>  <br>  "Men expect from the various religions answers to the unsolved riddles of the human condition, which today, even as in former times, deeply stir the hearts of men: What is man? What is the meaning, the aim of our life? What is moral good, what sin? Whence suffering and what purpose does it serve? Which is the road to true happiness? What are death, judgment and retribution after death? What, finally, is that ultimate inexpressible mystery which encompasses our existence: whence do we come, and where are we going?<br>  <br>  2. From ancient times down to the present, there is found among various peoples a certain perception of that hidden power which hovers over the course of things and over the events of human history; at times some indeed have come to the recognition of a Supreme Being, or even of a Father. This perception and recognition penetrates their lives with a profound religious sense."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651028_nostra-aetate_en.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_counc...</a>|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	While as a Christian parent, I have tried to fulfill my duty to God and my children by teaching them what I believe, ultimately, nobody can force another to have faith. We can make our kids go to church, but we cannot force them to listen. All we can do is show them that they have a choice, and that it is the most important choice they will ever make. God does not judge us by what we do or what we were taught but by what is in our hearts. God bless.|`|dKgkHZf3aa	You aren't forced by God... if that were true, you wouldn't have the choice to not believe in Him... He would make us all perfect and robotic.  I suppose people can force us, but our hearts are never forced in one direction or another.  Everything is a choice.  God guides us along, but we choose whether we want to listen to Him or not.  There is the truth... and there is the choice to accept it... And you will find it if you seek with all of your heart.|`|RFuWnx00aa	because He left it up to us to chose Him.. He's not going to force you to follow Him if you don't want to.. but the choice is yours.. heaven or hell...<br>  i think He pretty much thought it'd be obvious we'd chose to follow Him after all He went through to save us, but the devil has his ways of getting to people and sadly many people don't chose salvation.. i hope you make the right choice...<br>  and NO ONE IS FORCED.. why would you think that? people that try to pursade you its because they care about your life, not cause they are trying to force you.. and yeah its wrong for them to be like all trying to get you into it when you dont want to, but sometimes in the long run it pays off and the person really does accept christ in their heart, ive seen it happen.. but at the end its your choice.. you could be forced to go to church to read the bible or wahtever.. but if its not your desire to follow God, then you are not, no matter waht they make you do.. cause its what's in your heart that God sees, not what you do or what people make you do.<br>  it is your choice.<br>  i hope this answers your question|`|AA10747877	No one can choose God until God first chooses them. No one can come to God on their own. We are sinful and our nature is bent away from God, not towards Him. That's why it is all grace, so God is the only one who gets the credit, not sinful man.|`|8W066zbJaa	USA! USA!
PAUB1Sm3aa	It's not shallow, per se.<br>  <br>  People are just very suspicious. I mean, how many people would really believe that some random answerer dude was raising money for a cancer sufferer? In these times, there are a lot of fakers out there.<br>  <br>  EX: My mom was out buying groceries, and this man came up to her begging for money because he was out there freezing to death and needed shelter. Apparently he didn't realize that he was lugging a six-pack of beer around and smelled strongly of it. <br>  <br>  Also, people don't like to talk about things that aren't shallow because they could cause a lot of discomfort. I mean, 'OMG LOL LIKE BREAK UP WITH HER!' is not hard to say. On the other hand, it's pretty hard to talk to someone about death.<br>  <br>  Plus the Singles & Dating section gets a lot more answerers than other sections.|`|bdade993e630dbc15f1df344277bad03aa	think about wording your questions differently. Then people will answer. <br>  <br>  for example, this question is worded like you are some sort of ignorant philosopher. Don't ask stupid questions. <br>  <br>  when compared to other animals, humans come pretty deep. they can understand pretty complex emotions and feelings.|`|S5ZYHiFaaa	the second one. you'll also notice that technology has completely taken over our lives. if you go to the filthiest, poorest country in the world where they can't even afford to feed themselves, you can bet your *** that they at least own a TV.|`|Dujw71Muaa	It's human nature. Don't worry about it! You're just confused.|`|qda3oneuaa	You really think someone who is concerned with cancer and things like that really have time to come on the computer and answer a question weather or not they care?<br>  I'm sorry but this kid you knew...personal friend or anything like that? I mean...i don't think i have room to judge, but did you concern yourself with  the whole '...mom was DYING of cancer' because it affected you in some way. In a way that is shallow. <br>  Not all people are shallow i know some people that are so selfless it is amazing, but maybe, just maybe those people that are shallow have a reason, you got to think maybe no one ever concerned them selves with said person so they had to make sure they were fine, first. You know put themselves first because no one else did. <br>  I guess i don't have any room to talk, but it seems you need to open your mind, have some compassion. I don't know if i came off rude...but if i did i am sorry :) i can honestly say that i didn't mean to.|`|l3L28h3Paa	What happened is not how you worded your question but how people read the question.  They may have thought you were wanting money over the internet.  I don't know how you worded your question about raising money.  I would have given you a few ideas if i had run across it.  And sometimes it is where you post your questions.  Many people do not look at something they are not interested in.  If you find where you can post the question where there would be more people looking then you would have had a better turn out.|`|ee30c12fc32e951b85fac3bf9bc65f25aa	I don't know.  Maybe because no one wants to talk about death and dying because they know they will have to face it eventually.  Or maybe because of the way the economy is everyone is pinching pennies and can't afford to give.|`|uBNX4Cg7aa	They probably just didn't know what to say to the cancer question. Not to mention that they have no idea how true your story is.|`|vkIkFgqiaa	Your shallow. stop calling people things you know nothing about.|`|4yg7zZZ2aa	I bet you think you're special for not being "shallow, like everyone else". That's a form of vanity.<br>  <br>  1) Trying to raise money on Y!A is against the TOS. As is having another account.<br>  <br>  2) Most intelligent people figured when you were asking for money, it really was just a scam.<br>  <br>  3) You do not have enough evidence to support your claim. <br>  Most humans don't even come here. Twenty answers is not a real representative of all people, living everywhere. It isn't.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of reasons for what you experienced. You must take into account at which time you asked, in which subject area you asked in (traffic is better in some then others), etc.<br>  <br>  By the way, helping people with dating advice isn't really "sallow".
AA11313798	I think boxers are only allowed when it was a random event and you guys decided to just swim... like say you visted a park and decided to hop in the lake.<br>  <br>  I think it's also okay if its with family.<br>  <br>  But since you're going to a friend's house.. and you know you have to swim.. you'd better get some real shorts. Boxers don't have much coverage.. especially in liquid. lol.. and plus there's the opening in the front.. whether it has a button or not, you'd be better off with shorts.<br>  <br>  Just head to the store real fast before her house and get some cheap shorts, no big deal.|`|loqsl5xXaa	yes she would be (well not freaked out, but having a face where she is saying uh, no).. wear shorts (borrow a pair from dad or bother) if you don't have the right kind to swim in.|`|M627my7Baa	It wouldn't be 'freaky and disgusting' but it wouldn't work. Tell her, "I can come over, but I can't swim because I don't have trunks." Maybe she's got an extra pair.|`|AA11452160	If it was a spur of the moment thing ... sure.<br>  But you were told in advance, find one somewhere.<br>  Bring a towel too! :)|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	just wear jeans. tell her that you don't have shorts. <br>  plus with the weight of the jeans after it gets soaked, you'll get a good workout swimming in them.<br>  Just don't forget to bring another pair to change into later.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Not boxers,  they are too thin. When those get wet, it's almost like being naked.<br>  <br>  Regular shorts (the outerwear kind) would be much better.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	You're better off with a pair of shorts,  Boxers have that opening in the front, and after being in the pool....<br>  I wouldn't advise it.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	No boxers, wear basketball shorts or cut offs or something, just not boxers.|`|vxeMZXrgaa	~better wear shorts~|`|F2wI6NGNaa	i would be freaked out and disgusted a pair of shorts would be ok though
kclpa0Abaa	I think that style and the colour on number 2 would be awesome for you.<br>  <br>  I think it will spice you up a little.|`|ocy7FEcaaa	Both of those hair styles would look great on you.|`|0121db3d89fa7258a5d230763048afc9aa	i think you would look good with the second one. i'd go for it if i were you!|`|a3OCK2iraa	No I don't think so. I mean your hair being thick isn't the problem(that is what straighteners and haircuts are for)<br>  I think that your face is the wrong shape. You have a round face and the men in the pictures do not. It could end up making your face look fatter.<br>  What I would suggest is bringing in those pictures as a guideline and having a consultation at a good hair salon( do not go to any cheap chain places)<br>  <br>  There was a hair cut that I really wanted and when I showed my hairstylist the pic she said it wouldn't go with my face...so just keep that in mind.<br>  And even though I didn't get the exact haircut I wanted I am really happy with it.|`|dC7nBu53aa	Number 2 definitely. There is more texture and color in it, or highlights.<br>  The messy looks hot nowadays , kinda........|`|YlMR42agaa	I love 2 it's so stylish and it's a complete make over to make you look faboulous!<br>  <br>  1 is not so different from what you have..so 2|`|cHXVpXeJaa	omg you would look sexy with a lip ring :)<br>  <br>  the second one or<br>  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_NO2UOMMYKZ0/SHStZ8SNMII/AAAAAAAAAa4/4vu825NeQHk/s400/Hot%2BEmo%2BBoy.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_NO2UOMMYKZ0/SH...</a><br>  <br>  you would just haft to thin your a hair a bit.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tasha <3|`|urbo9yUqaa	oh, you already have that kind of hairstyle.<br>  All you need is more layers and thinning out.<br>  <br>  That'll look very good on you :D<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6KsIsFbaaa	i dont think your face will look good with those styles<br>  those men have very thin hair and your hair is pretty thick<br>  i say just leave it or keep looking|`|rh2cRpMHaa	The second one is really good. Two thumbs up for your taste! :)|`|aW5uShwtaa	You're hot|`|P8kzKpOyaa	I honestly think they're all really rad!
OUbNSXjJaa	Just now I was also thinking how to interact with angels in order to get a serious doubt cleared. It is a coincidence that you have asked this question. Some body told me sometime back that angles can speak in any language. Angels are supposed to be master of every thing.|`|ZAT8yqaGaa	short answer- I have not spoken to either an angel or demon so I would have no idea on such matters. Paul might have mentiend the tounges of an angel- but this could also be a metephor for praising and speaking about God.<br>  This is after all what Angels wouls speak about.|`|rDfqzCzkaa	there is an a angelic tongue paul said though i speak with the tongues of angels or men and have not love.........<br>   why would he do this if they did not have a language or speech of their own.

But it really depends what time fajr is over there, here in Australia fajr is around 5am, and it's nearly 3:30pm now- so I'm ok!!!<br>  <br>  I do sometimes get caught up on the computer and I stay up waaaaay past my bedtime- are u feeling sleepy yet??<br>  <br>  peace|`|vVxVCOCraa	11 pm here.. but.. mmm.. it'd be a better idea to stay up for it.. because..

82AAOxCfaa	LMAO...i got that text earlier today!!!! i really thought about it too.|`|jGgOVd5Zaa	I was watching an episode of Wild West Tech once and they had a story about a lady of the evening who used to use a dollar coin placed in a certain way as a make shift diaphragm.  When she was done using it she'd set it on her dresser.<br>  <br>  The proper women in town always looked down on the harlots, except when it came time to collect money for charity.  They'd go door to door in the red light district.<br>  <br>  This particular soiled dove used to give them the dollars on her dresser.  It was a funny episode.  They also had a long list of alternate names for scarlet women.|`|0KtFtnZVaa	Do you ever wonder if the dollar you got back from the McDonald's clerk , directly before you stuck your hand in the bag and grabbed a handful of fries, came from the buttcrack of a stripper?<br>  <br>  I didn't think so.|`|u48Wzj3yaa	I'm guessing no, but then, I'm not really sure any of us can say that with certainty.... I mean, do you wonder that about every dollar you have? (Please, don't answer that)|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	I'll be glad to take that tainted booty off of their hands.<br>  <br>  Pun intended.|`|BFcVLRc2aa	Guilty.|`|oopg697aaa	LOL funny....once my friend wiped his **** with one and later rinsed it with water and gave it in the church|`|HX89Q73Xaa	...|`|uBNX4Cg7aa	No you sicko.|`|5HymYJ5haa	I will pray for you after I finish LOLing.|`|lMmhkeZ0aa	It all spends the same.|`|QrBReRQbaa	That never crossed my mind.|`|0Ad0SrEfaa	oh, they don't mind one bit. It's all about the cash.|`|u2BVwAKNaa	LMAO<br>  <br>  I don't think they care where it was..|`|bfWcfCKXaa	As long as it goes for a good cause, I don't care!|`|QDP59FJ3aa	ive never thought of that!|`|k7973dtIaa	Never..but your lack of disrespect for a group is appreciated. You are special.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	Sadly it's crossed my mind.|`|aNlT1NRqaa	Well if it wasn't before, it might be after.|`|M3Xmqlt8aa	Well that is about all the action some of them are gonna get. I have a feeling, that maybe some of that money finds it's way back to the buttcrack of a stripper, LMAO!|`|4HUZJdVNaa	Bet they will read this and start cleaning all that money yes all these churches will have a money sniffing machines at all the front doors|`|8vAxlg2Daa	nope money is money|`|2C8U7Itqaa	HA, star for you!<br>  <br>  Wonder if the money was ever used by a stripper for crack?|`|4TiWZLKXaa	Can't answer that, however, I do know now I will carry a can of Lysol with me every where I go and spray down those coins and bills I get back from cashiers and anyone else that hands me money.|`|SPNHhFXoaa	Well, that's an interesting thought.<br>  <br>  Esp since I have to handle money at work everyday.|`|nVCf8EC5aa	Oh I am sure some of it has.|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	There's no wonder.<br>  it has been.|`|iYEWbE23aa	Humans get lonely too!|`|EXurNsB4aa	I feel like washing my hands now.|`|cFaCmYrXaa	LMMFAO!!!!|`|AA11180647	wow thats funny i don't have an answer i just wanted to say thank you that made me cheese real hard
iHDYncuXaa	Why worry? God will prevail.|`|9YMLsk7Taa	yes but we better get ready cause it's going to get worse before it gets better. We are in the end times dear sister in Christ. Those who endure to the end.....|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Not me.|`|AA12152549	Not really.  After all, Scripture does point out that we might expect persecutions.  And besides that, not everyone's going to go for some of the ways some Christians live out their religious commitments.  As you know, some Christians are fakes since their words and their actions don't mesh appropriately.  Mahatma Gandhi once said, "I like your Christ.  I do not like your Christians.  They are so unlike your Christ."|`|lDEGaK7Laa	It's basically Christianity's own fault anyway.<br>  <br>  When a religion is so in-your-face about what it believes to be truth, and is so obviously bigoted towards gays and "sinners" of all stripes, what does anyone really expect?<br>  <br>  EDIT: I second RU486's sentiments.|`|ZoPln7vaaa	I'm not worried but I'm disappointed|`|c0KKHMsAaa	*facepalm*|`|28216207e17752f6c782dd9a28e07f1faa	Oh, you poor, persecuted Christians. You've spent decades persecuting everyone else, and now you're getting called on it and sensible people are pushing back against you. Boo hoo.<br>  <br>  You people haven't the first clue what real persecution is. You should be praying you never find out. <br>  <br>  No one hates Christianity. What we hate is your efforts to dismantle the Constitution. What we hate is your efforts to have your book of fairy tales codified into the law of the land. What we hate is your efforts to have your biblical fantasies taught as science in our publicly-funded schools. What we hate is your efforts to turn our free society into a Christian version of Iran, where religious faith is enforced by law. <br>  <br>  Since Christianity is the majority religion in this country (and I think a lot of people just call themselves "Christian" to avoid being yarked at by rabid believers), you really have nothing to worry about. Claiming Christianity is "hated" is disingenuous at best.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	i am more concerned about the "mark of the beast" CHIP and the prophecy that says We will be beheaded for not accepting it. <br>  which means literally the antichristian society is based on Money and the love thereof rather than on the LOVE of constitutional freedom.|`|GQk0UNjfaa	I guess it's time for me to break out the worlds smallest violin. So Sorry you can't publicly stone gay people you christian supremacist piece of dirt.|`|1cGlucXyaa	No, because Jesus said that His true followers will be persecuted. But we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us.|`|VRl1jENHaa	Yes, but I believe that this is nothing compared to what is coming.|`|ID55hffpaa	Oh boo hoo.<br>  <br>  Are you so blind you can't see what Christians are doing to everyone else in America?|`|GYL5PjC4aa	Not really no because we Americans don't give a ****|`|AA11124121	no..the anti-christ will appear as a christian..then it really hits the fan.|`|E7fguoVBaa	Nope.  Don't you put your trust in God?  He is watching.  No worries.  He knows.<br>  <br>  The Bible says it will get worse before it gets better.  If you read your Bible, this would all be no surprise.  Read 2 Timothy 3.<br>  <br>  Note one of the features of this sign that is prominent today: ‘Men will have a form of godly devotion but prove false to its power.’ (2?Timothy 3:2,?5) No other period in history has been characterized by such powerful and thorough secularization. God has been widely rejected as the only authority, and most people do not accept the Bible as the only source of truth. Of course, religions still exist, but many have little influence. They are only a veneer.<br>  <br>  The Bible mentions another feature of the sign: “Men will be .?.?. without self-control, fierce,” and “because of the increasing of lawlessness the love of the greater number will cool off.” (2?Timothy 3:2,?3; Matthew 24:12) The Greek word translated “fierce” means, among other things, “lacking human sympathy and feeling.” Today ever younger children are showing themselves to be “fierce” and are committing increasingly violent crimes.<br>  <br>  Fast-paced technical and economic developments, and the greed these have brought with them, have caused more and more people to throw aside old?values. Without regard for others, they use any available means, even dishonest ones, to grab as much as they can to satisfy their selfish desires. <br>  <br>  A feature especially prevalent in our time is this one: “Men will be .?.?. lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.” (2?Timothy 3:2, 4) One example of this is that people want sensual pleasure, but they do not want the responsibility of living with one marriage partner for a lifetime. The result has been a tidal wave of wrecked family relations, unhappy and rootless children, and sexually transmitted diseases.<br>  <br>  Another aspect of the sign is that?“men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money.” (2?Timothy 3:2) According to the German magazine Die Zeit, “the motor of [today’s economic] system is selfishness.” More than ever before, the pursuit of money is the most important thing in many people’s lives. In this selfish pursuit, other values are ignored.<br>  <br>  Besides describing the breakdown in human values, the Bible also foretold that the last days would be marked by extraordinary upheavals that would affect the human family. It says, for example, that “nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be great earthquakes, and in one place after another pestilences and food shortages.”—Luke 21:10, 11.|`|BFcVLRc2aa	You really have no one else to blame but yourselves for that, because of the superiority-complex you give yourselves, acting like you were Angels sent from the Kingdom of Heaven itself to deliver justice and peace on us, when really your trying to over-compensate for your feelings of un-importance in society by throwing yourself into your religion and thus pushing it on others who don't want nor should they have to listen or accept.|`|UyDkYaXuaa	Oddly enough, the more Christians that decrease the more peace their is? <br>  <br>  Hmm. How does this happen? <br>  <br>  I don't hate Christianity, I just don't agree with it or any religion that thinks it has the nerve to merge itself with politics. <br>  <br>  <br>  3 words: Treaty of Tripoli|`|AA10880624	No, I'm not worried.

This is the hate based on the irrational belief that a god tells them "infallible" things about other people they do not agree with. And we all know that their god "hates" because he said so in his book. He says who he hates. So if this divinity is so cruel to torture people he hates for all eternity then there is certainly no reason for his followers NOT to draw a similar conclusion about the same people.|`|43s63XTEaa	I'm sick of people proclaiming God hates certain types of people!<br>  <br>  God doesn't hate the LBGT community; OR Atheists. He hates SIN. Okay? Are we clear on that? <br>  <br>  God loves all of his children; whether you're bisexual, homosexual, transgendered, a prostitute, etc., He still loves you. <br>  <br>  And no. I'm not worried. I have no reason to be worried. I don't force my beliefs on others, and unless I'm asked to, I don't shove a Bible in people's faces. Everyone has their beliefs, and I have no right to judge. At the end of the day; we'll meet our maker. And He will judge us. ALL of us. Not just the Christians, not just the Atheists, not just the Buddhists, ALL of us. <br>  <br>  So no, I'm not afraid. America is really rather hypocritical. 80% call themselves "Christian", but follow those 80% around for a week, and by observing their actions, you conclude that 56% of those "Christians" are hypocrites. At least the other 20% have the decency to be honest.<br>  <br>  EDIT: And another thing- the only reason Christianity is growing to be "hated" among America and other countries is because some "Christians" think they are better than people who aren't. They also think they're better than LBGT's, which they are not. We are all created equal, and God sees us all equally. I am no better than you, and you are no better than me. That's the cool thing about Christianity; no matter who or where you are, there's always someone looking over you.

AA11849917	School regulations can NOT interfere with your constitutional rights to attend church on Good Friday.  It is against the law, period!<br>  <br>  And, yes, to the non-believer, Good Friday IS just another day, so let THEM go to school (or work, or whatever), but Christians MUST be given the liberty to go to church, because the state may not make any laws that prohibit one's religion or the free exercise thereof.  THAT is what is meant by "Separation of Church and State"!|`|1TYZDRUqaa	Good Friday is a Christian Holiday, and public schools should not celebrate it.

Easter is so pointless.|`|VuxRyhE8aa	I am Catholic ( non-practicing) but I always made it a point to take off from my job on Good Friday.  It's a question of respect and I have great respect for my faith.  Good Friday is a religious observance day and therefore has much significance to Christians.  A snow day has no significance.  One of the problems with our country today is that, we are getting away from Christianity when we should be moving towards it.  Don't let your faith fall by the wayside.  Let the non-Christians go to school if they want to, you stay home and go to church.  If you vote or know Christians who do, tell them to vote not to make Good Friday a snow day.|`|yDJiiqcsaa	This is a funny thing.  For ten years I worked at a Trappist monastery and the monks worked a half day on Good Friday, but I never felt right about that and would take the day off.  There were about 10 of us lay persons that worked therein different capacities (cooks, maintenance, in the store, etc)  Eventually it was noticed that I chose to work on Martin Luther King's day - a day that they gave us as a holiday and that is the day that I "used" to take off on Good Friday.  The black workers didn't like my "disrespect" to MLK so eventually the Monastery gave us BOTH days off.  I just tell that story to demonstrate that it is strange who and how decisions like that are made.  Whether I get paid or not I take Good Friday off (I no longer work there) because it just seems gauche to have "business as usual" on that day.  I always feel like a family member died and I can't keep my mind on work and can't devote my thoughts to Him fully either.|`|akGDhUGfaa	I had off on every Good Friday, went to a parochial HS.

The word for "god" (note the small 'g' in English) is "Elah". Compare this to "Eloi" and "Eli" in the New Testament.<br>  <br>  The word "Allah" is the perfect word to describe the God of Jews and Christians as it does not permit gender nor plural. Therefore, when the word is used as in "Eloihim" or "Allahumma" (these would appear at first to be plural and/or female genders) it becomes clear it is the royal usage such as a king would use in referring to his royal station while make a decree of some type. The king would state, "We decree the following..." and he is actually talking about his royal position rather than plural status.<br>  <br>  There is no word in English for the "God" of Israel, the "God" of Jesus. This explains why the spelling remains the same whether speaking of a false "god" or pagan idol and the "God" of Abraham or Moses or Jesus (peace be upon them). Note the use of the capital "g" (G). This is the only way English can present a difference between the two. In the Semitic languages it is easy to distinguish the difference between a "god" and "The God" due to the structure of the word itself.<br>  <br>  Evidence for this is quite simple. Visit any motel or hotel and remove the Bible located in the drawer next to the bed (placed they courtesy of the Gideon Society). Note inside the first few pages a reference to the translations of the Bible they have made into 27 languages. The second example they give is to the Arabic language of the passage in the New Testament from the Gospel of John 3:16. The verse begins in English; "For God so loved the world.." and in the Arabic translation the word used for "God" is "Allah."<br>  <br>  The Arabic Bible beginning with the Book of Genesis uses the word "Allah" to represent "The God" of Creation; Adam and Eve; Noah; Abraham; Ishmael and Isaac and Israel. Page one of Genesis has the word "Allah" 17 times.|`|fjH2IY0Daa	lol r ya serious|`|BwrG5xTvaa	And why is this a question for the Muslims? Why do you feel the need to bother these people with this?

I don't know your relationship and I know a bit about domination and submission and if your both into that then that's fine as long as he still respects you, but If he's seriously pushing you to do things you're not comfortable with though then he doesn't respect you and you need to break off the relationship, it's not safe or healthy for you.
TzY9vkinaa	I've been to Catholic mass once, it was all very strange and quite different from Mormon sacrament meeting.<br>  <br>  This is how Mormon sacrament meeting is<br>  -Someone from the bishopric announces church news, and announces who has been released from church callings and who has been called to church callings. <br>  - Someone, who was previously asked, says the opening prayer<br>  - The congregation sings a hymn<br>  - The sacrament is blessed and passed to the congregation<br>  - Talks are given by people from the congregation who were previously asked to prepare a talk. A hymn is usually sung between talks.<br>  - Someone, who was previously asked, says the closing prayer.<br>  <br>  On fast Sundays (the first Sunday of the month) instead of speakers we have the time left open for people to share their testimonies. Fast Sunday is my favorite :)<br>  <br>  Also, occasionaly instead of a hymn, someone will perform a musical number, or the choir will sing.<br>  <br>  Every once in awhile the church has a Sacrament Meeting where the primary children have a program and all the little kids get to say a little something about the gospel and sing songs. It's very cute.<br>  <br>  <br>  Add:<br>  when I went to catholic mass I later learned that it's "peace be with you"... I thought she said "pleased to meet you" and I said "pleased to meet you too" HAHA woops :P|`|mfSp38yzaa	It is my understanding that Mormons don't have a Mass.<br>  <br>  Here's a site that explains their service.<br>  <a href="http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/commentary/of-chapels-and-temples-explaining-mormon-worship-services" rel="nofollow">http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/...</a><br>  <br>  Couple of things I MUST say though...<br>  #1 If they have a Communion service, as a Catholic, you should NOT receive, and<br>  #2 You should still attend Mass either Saturday night or sometime Sunday.

Here's the nuts and bolts.<br>  <br>  Appropriate dress is dress/skirt.  The sacrament service lasts for 70 minutes.  First, you will enter the chapel and sit down - organ music playing.  There will be a welcome, announcement of the opening song and who will give the opening prayer.  (Someone from the congregation has been asked to do so ahead of time.)  After singing the song, the person will give the prayer.  No kneeling, no signs of the cross - a simple amen is given my the congregation at the end of the prayer.  Next will come a few announcements, etc.  There is another song preparing for the sacrament (similar to the communion) and then after that song, the priests (young men of the age of 16) will bless the bread.  The boys from age 12 will pass the bread to the congregation.  No other prayers are said.  Usually only members of the church will take the bread and water.  Next, there will be a similar prayer over the water - passing of water, etc.<br>  <br>  After this is done, there is usually a youth speaker or two and perhaps a musical number by the choir or a hymn.  There will be a couple of speakers (adults) next.  The speakers are all members of the congregation - the speaking assignments rotate.  All clergy (the Bishop and his counselors) are volunteer.  After each talk, the speaker concludes in the name of Jesus Christ and the congregation replies Amen with the speaker.<br>  <br>  At the end there are usually a few comments from the Bishop or one of his counselors followed by another song and prayer.<br>  <br>  It is a simple service.  The first Sunday of each month is a special service called fast and testimony meeting.  All members fast for two meals and give the money that they saved by not eating to the poor.  The meeting is the same as what I just described, excepting the speakers.  The members take turns sharing their testimony of Jesus Christ and His teachings.  Anyone my speak that desires to.  These meetings are often misunderstood - thinking it is the norm for a sacrament meeting - but it is not.  It is an opportunity to confess before our Saviour our love for Him and His Gospel.<br>  <br>  I hope that clears things up for you - and you can easily ask your friend - I am sure they would be happy to answer your questions and address them directly, as it is difficult to do in a forum like Y!A.<br>  Have a great day!|`|c0KKHMsAaa	cookies and punch.
eO2rnf7yaa	Paul was encouraging people to be distinct from the common society at that time, which he though was corrupt.   If you think that verse advises people to disregard the Church, you are mistaken.  The advice is very much to disregard the contemporary world - which ignores tradition entirely.   <br>  <br>  By "discern"  Paul did not mean that people are supposed to produce within themselves some arbitrary idea of the Will of God.  It means that people are supposed to use their senses and mental faculties to come to understand the Truth.   The point Paul was making is that one is not supposed to have an idea about the Will of God on only a flimsy basis.  To discern something is to come to a conclusion based on very careful and thoughtful processing of information.   <br>  <br>  It is clear from Paul's writings that He considered sacred scripture and genuine sacred tradition very important to the process of discernment.      As you seemed to hint in your question,  taking single verses out of context is a bad idea.   <br>  <br>  Paul wrote verses as parts of letters.  He sent letters,  not verses, and not collections of verses.  They were letters and should be read as such if we want to be careful to avoid error.    Paul, in other letters, also made it clear that he believed scripture should be interpreted by the Church.<br>  <br>  Discern with great care,   and consult experts when possible - like The Church. <br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic.<br>  Peace be with you.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	All scripture is manufactured.

Because they can......That's as simple as it gets.   <br>  <br>  What gets me is that the blacks are always accusing the white folk of racism......Personally I have never seen Miss "White" America, or "White" history month, or the NAA W P, or "CLOUD" magazine, because if "we" did we'd be racist.  But can somebody tell me why "they" can have it and why the whites can't?   And to comment on what "Blake" said about ignorant remarks white men say won't keep them down........     Can you blame them for making remarks?  Really, can anyone?    If whites got all the privileges that blacks got maybe there would be no need for "ignorant" remarks.  But it's so backwards.  We can thank our wonderful government for causing division in our society.   What's good for you should be good for me.  If everyone had the "same" rights, there wouldn't be any need for animosity.  But thats NOT the case.

ixFbNr4taa	Investiture..............<br>  <br>  Canonical Investiture is the act by which a suzerain granted a fief to his vassal, and the ceremonies which accompanied that grant. From the middle of the eleventh century, and perhaps during the first half of that century, the term was used to designate the act and the ceremonies by which princes granted to bishops and abbots, besides their titles, the possessions which constituted their benefices, and the political rights which they were to exercise (see INVESTITURES, CONFLICT OF). The putting in possession was done after the investiture by enthronization (q. v.). The decretals use the word investitura to signify the concession of an ecclesiastical benefice; only since the thirteenth century has it signified the act of putting one in possession of such a benefice. This is the sense in which it is now used; it is synonymous with Institutio corporalis. (See INSTITUTION, CANONICAL; INSTALLATION.)

Any person can enjoy the physical stimulation of a kiss from another person, male or female, and it has no bearing on sexual orientation.  A gay man doesn't turn straight or bisexual if he has sex with a woman any more than a lesbian turns bisexual or straight if she sleeps with a man.  The acts are just acts and anyone can do them and enjoy the stimulation.<br>  <br>  Sexual orientation is as innate to someone as eye color or musical talent.  If you've always been attracted to girls and haven't been attracted to guys, odds are you're 100% straight.  I'm a Gold Star lesbian (never been with a man) and I've shared some amazing kisses with guy friends that didn't have any impact on my lesbianism.  Sometimes a kiss is just a kiss.  Just chalk it up as something that happened and don't worry about it.

Those doing this do not apply truthful Bible principles and to these ones I have no use and do not associate. If I am in a situation where they are in a position to right a wrong, or to take action necessary because I am being persecuted or victimized, then if they drop the ball, I expose them and then complain officially about these ones --- these men who behave sexistly and brush my serious concerns to the side for these ones are not men of God and I don't have any use for them.<br>  <br>  Secondly, did you know that all scripture is inspired by God?<br>  <br>  2nd Timothy 3:16 - 17<br>  <br>  All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.<br>  <br>  This goes for women too, but I will admit this society does harbor a great deal of sexism and discrimination against women. Beware of those men who claim to be "Christians" but are really wolves in cheap, blasphemous and ruinous clothing.<br>  <br>  If they are not doing it God's way, say a prayer for them and get the dickens away from them. Report them if need be.

w8Bwi65oaa	Satan is of the earth. He is a benign force; He aids mankind and helps us develop into higher beings - He helps us evolve. He subtly influences our advancements in technologies in order to help us strive forward. He comes to His followers through ceremony, through altered states of consciousness. He is with those that respect Him. He asks of us dependence and relying on the self - not always asking of him his aid. He is there for guidance. And in no way does instruct us to mindlessly murder Christians.<br>  <br>  Satan is not evil, his actions are not cursed and he is not responsible for the atrocities of modern society. Society weaves its own nightmarish yarns, not a deity. We alone alter, manipulate and set in stone our individual fates. Satan is merely there for those who invite Him into their lives to help them progress. He is a challenger of modern values, thoughts, and dogma. Not just Christian dogma - but ALL dogma. <br>  <br>  The Satan in the Bible is not the Satan I speak of. Satan is an ancient deity of the ancient world that was taken and vilified by certain overzealous and influential denominations in order to sustain the great lie and advocate the worship of a greater idiot. <br>  <br>  Satan means adversary. Ancient gods were seen as adversaries of the new faiths, therefore they were taken, distorted and cast as demons. Satan goes by many names. Set, Enki, et cetera. These names were tossed aside and replaced with Satan. Take for instance the minor Roman god, Lucifer. Lucifer is/was of Roman origin. He predates God and the relevant denominations. Lucifer not fitting in with Christianity's picture led to his vilification as with all the other gods and goddesses.|`|iHLt9Juyaa	Satan absolutely exists, He is the great liar and deceiver.

"Did God create everything that exists?" A student bravely replied, "Yes he did!" "God created everything?" The professor asked.<br>  <br>  "Yes sir, he certainly did," the student replied.<br>  <br>  The professor answered, "If God created everything; then God created evil. And, since evil exists, and according to the principal that our works define who we are, then we can assume God is evil."<br>  The student became quiet and did not answer the professor's hypothetical definition. The professor, quite pleased with himself, boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the Christian faith was a myth.<br>  <br>  Another student raised his hand and said, "May I ask you a question, professor?" "Of course", replied the professor. The student stood up and asked, "Professor, does cold exist?" "What kind of question is this? Of course it exists. Have you never been cold?" The other students snickered at the young man's question.<br>  The young man replied, "In fact sir, cold does not exist. According to the laws of physics, what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat. Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy.<br>  Absolute zero (-460 F) is the total absence of heat; and all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature. Cold does not exist.<br>  We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat."<br>  The student continued, "Professor, does darkness exist?" The professor responded, "Of course it does."<br>  The student replied, "Once again you are wrong sir, darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in reality the absence of light. Light we can study, but not darkness. In fact, we can use Newton's prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color. You cannot measure darkness. A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it. How can you know how dark a certain space is?<br>  You measure the amount of light present. Isn't this correct? Darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present."<br>  Finally the young man asked the professor, "Sir, does evil exist?"<br>  Now uncertain, the professor responded, "Of course, as I have already said. We see it everyday. It is in the daily examples of man's inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil." <br>  To this the student replied, "Evil does not exist, sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart. It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat, or the darkness that comes when there is no light."<br>  The professor sat down.<br>  (The young man's name ~ Albert Einstein)|`|c7pbvYmpaa	"He exists only in my memory"|`|lDbNf3h9aa	He's a made up scape goat for mankind.

People in New England are kind.<br>  Honestly, it depends on what you are looking for but let me break it down.<br>  <br>  Education:<br>  Winner = Northern States<br>  Reason = their education system is more advanced, they rank top annually when it comes to education and they have the best colleges. Their high schools have more funding than Southern High schools so Education up north whether it be High School or College is great.<br>  <br>  Economy:<br>  Winner = Southern States<br>  Reason = Although we are in a state of panic right now with the economy, you will have a better shot of finding a job down South than you will up north. People in the North are laid off consistently in factory jobs and at times it is a shame but what can you do. Most people from up north are coming down south to look for jobs so the South is the winner here.<br>  <br>  Culture<br>  Winner = North (IMO)<br>  Reason = Okay, honestly I said IMO which equals in my opinion, I pick the North because you get more diversity. You may see an all Asian neighborhood or an all White neighborhood or anything. Also, I like the lifestyle up north which is quick.<br>  <br>  Racism<br>  Winner = Surprisingly Southern States<br>  Reason = throw out the whole "Redneck" thing, in the Northeast, outside of New England most states are racist as racist gets. People in Inner City New York will KILL a person just for being White or Asian. Make no mistake; NYC and Philadelphia are two of the worst cities to be in if you are White, if you are Asian they can be hellholes, if you are a Middle Easterner, I cannot even say. The Northeast is full of racist minorities and inner city idiots, I much rather live in a hicktown in West Virginia, YES the 2 Northeast cities I named are THAT BAD.<br>  <br>  things to do<br>  Winner = Northeast<br>  Reason = Big cities, more entertainment, more programs, more everything, if you have a lot of money, the Northeast is the way to go.<br>  <br>  Weather<br>  Winner = The South<br>  Reason = Unless you like snowstorms and heavy snow, the south wins this by a landslide.<br>  <br>  Overall Winner = South <br>  <br>  Now if I was to include New England then the Northeast would be slightly better than the South but usually when people say the North they mean states like New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, basically urbanized armpits. <br>  <br>  New England > South > North|`|T3Tpgz5Vaa	Speaking as a Californian (born and raised), I find this to be the case as well.<br>  <br>  People are more stressed in the north, also some people mistranslated their abruptness and caution as hostility.|`|OtLqGZK8aa	In my opinion if you are white and not homosexual and you are a bit old fashioned then you will love it in the south, but for the rest of us there are mostly cons instead of pros.<br>  <br>  But that is just a generalization.<br>  <br>  The only pro is that at least people will behave themselves even if they don't agree with your lifestyle but if you ask them why, be prepared to hear them talk about what the lord says.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire could have taken over and converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.<br>  <br>  Point of Order: Vlad Tepes and Elizabeth Bathory were not vampires. They were sadistic tyrants who abused their power to feed their homicidal impulses, but they were humans who lived and died. The act of drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating grass makes you a cow.|`|1wNsBNmxaa	no vampires are not real put the book away cause it will warp your mind in tell you vampires are real in yes you are very confused you have to many teens out there trying to bite each other i wish they never ever made the book kids out there in the real world are hurting each other just because of the movie and the the book<br>  <br>  <br>  D?mon~~?|`|y3jD0DDpaa	LISTEN TO BEARCLAW ALL HIS INFORMATION IS CORRECT! THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO MARK HIM DOWN ARE PEOPLE WHO CANT HANDLE THE TRUTH!<br>  <br>  VAMPIRES CANT AND DONT EXIST!|`|MYO2k9EUaa	Vampires do not exist in the real world. The myth of the Vampires was created by humans who saw a Vampire Bat (a small species of bat) sucking the blood out of livestock, and, very rarely, human beings. <br>  <br>  The stories escalated from there, because humans are easily excitable creatures. <br>  <br>  Also, the Twilight series sucks, literally. Go find a Harry Potter book instead.|`|jntNV6QDaa	Yes, but not like stoker's. You can not turn into a bat, to kill one you don't have to stab they heart. However people do drink blood for sexy reasons, religion reasons, and many more. Some say "vampires" use to be cannibals that have learned to just drink blood and not eat flesh. People do have skin disorders that can't make you feel like you are getting burned. So if you mix skin disorders and blooding you get a "vampires" .|`|jqXL4JDCaa	No, I'm pretty sure vampires are non-existent in all "worlds."|`|cRdiyGP9aa	hey. to awnser your question are vampires real. yes, although not what people make them out to be. just open your mind. if you mean do the vampires that everyone says cant come out in the sun are real, well no those are not real. however they do exsist. i even say it on the news. And in china they even make alternate blood for them. its really cool. and they to not really have to eat but they can eat our food|`|8YW0tCLlaa	I'm wondering the same question... maybe there are some among us. We are just too afraid to admit it. Scientifically if you think about it, it could be true if there are twilight vampires. For example, this venom can change up your DNA and add an extra chromosome. Maybe that's why it's so painful. This venom that has been injected could give you super-human abilities. It's kind of difficult to explain... but couldn't that happen? Maybe. <br>  <br>  I don't know if it's true if there are vampires. It's totally unknown. Some people think it's absolutely, 100% true that there are no vampires. But, how can we be sure? There are many things and phenomenons we can't explain.|`|HAaoKGU9aa	There are people who drink blood,and feed on that,but there's no such thing as flying bats and coffins and stuff,
7z1MIetkaa	ok so just like say like, like, like, a lot im white and for some reason i like say like like a lot (i don't really say it that many times) watch movies follow some white girl around and talk clearly and with much confidence|`|ixhyTrvRaa	haha I'm sorry but i find this a little funny. I guess I would say I "talk like a white girl". I usually use full sentences online and usually when I'm talking and the things I pick up most from people ( who don't really think about if what they're saying makes sense ) and the slang words that stand out most to me are "axsed" instead of "asked" and other weird slang words that you might find on urbandictionary.com. I guess what I could tell you is that if you really want to ditch the slang, talk more slowly and think about what you're going to say before you say it, so it doesn't come out a mixed jumble of words. Also, if you hang out with "white girls", you'd probably catch on! But remember, nothing's wrong with being hispanic, and that dosn't mean you have to talk like every other hispanic girl, but it's not a bad thing.|`|cWh9z8Bjaa	You could actually pay attention to how the British speak, they tend to articulate very well.  Make sure you don't slice off the last letter on words.  e.g. don't say "lettuh" say "letter" also try and learn some grammar e.g. when someone asks you how you did at something say "I did well" not "I did good."  Also part of sounding like a white girl is in the body language.  If you tend to move your head back and forth a lot (stereotypical of ghetto women) try not doing that.  The best way though is just imitation, watch movies and pay attention.  If you ever decide to live in somewhere besides a ghetto you'll probably pick up some mannerisms and ways of talking of the people in that community.|`|dWHZ4IFRaa	watching movies helps you a lot for you to talk without any slang's language.|`|7450f33ed68086f9825e28d7549be570aa	You mean that you want to speak like an educated person, not necessarily a white person.  There are lots of  people that are not white and they can speak correctly.  First thing you do is to buy a recorder and practice speaking, so you can listen to yourself.  Read, and listen to TV programs that don't use too many slangs.   Practice make perfect!  Good luck!!|`|988dbb7fd23d6f47880d9e468760317aaa	Try studying the language you want to talk politely. It is not about being white or not white, It is about education. If you really want it, you can do it!|`|n336SjRiaa	hmmm, maybe watch a lot of movies that have 'white girl talk' and mimic it. maybe try hanging out with more white talkingfolks. its a ll about self control.|`|6WxsrIusaa	Read.  Choose stuff that you know is going to use proper grammar and word choices, like newspapers or magazines like Time or Newsweek.  When you read the right material, you pick up on the subtleties of grammar, whether you realize it or not.  Reading may be more difficult and less fun, but you will get more out of it in terms of learning language--than, say, watching movies or listening to people.<br>  <br>  It is valuable to be able to talk a certain way.  If you wanted to get a job just about anywhere, you probably wouldn't want to sound like you just walked out of the ghetto.  Likewise, if I wanted to find someone in the ghetto, it probably wouldn't be a good idea for me to go around talking like I normally do (hint:  it doens't sound very different from the way this post reads).  It goes both ways, you see.<br>  <br>  If you want to sound "white", I would suggest that you consider what "sounding white" means.  If "sounding white" means using proper grammar and not using slang, please realize that you don't have to BE white for it to be okay to speak that way.  Black and Latino professionals speak this way all the time, and they don't feel they are "talking white" when they do--they're just speaking in a correct, educated manner.  You don't have to be a doctor or lawyer to earn the right to sound educated, either.  Just educate yourself.  That's all it takes.  <br>  <br>  And just because you have the ability to speak in a correct, educated-sounding manner doesn't mean you can't still use your "ghetto voice" whenever you feel like it.  People who go off to college from the ghetto and get educated and learn how to communicate as professionals don't then come back home and talk to their families like they're speaking to their bosses and colleagues in the professional world--they talk to their families like they grew up doing.  There's a time and a place for everything.<br>  <br>  The way you talk is part of your identity.  I sound like an educated, nerdy white person because I AM an educated, nerdy white person.  If you want to sound EDUCATED, you CAN BE THAT.  If you want to sound WHITE, well, then...best of luck...<br>  <br>  Wanting to sound different is one thing; being ashamed of the way you DO talk is quite another.  We all grow up learning to speak the language that is spoken around us--and more than that, we learn the specific vernacular that is spoken around us:  the slang, the expressions, etc.  You can't help where you were born, the kind of family or community you were born into, or the kind of language that you grew up with.  You CAN choose to learn a different language, or a different way of speaking your language, if you so choose.<br>  <br>  It's okay to want to be different.  Just make sure that, different or no different, you're happy with who you are.

If a smaller number precedes a larger number, the smaller number is Subtracted from the larger. <br>  <br>  For example, if you want to say 1,100 in Roman Numerals, you would say M for 1000 and then put a C after it for 100; in other words 1,100=MC in Roman Numerals.<br>  <br>  Some more examples:<br>  <br>  VIII = 5+3 = 8 <br>  IX = 10-1 = 9 <br>  XL = 50-10 = 40 <br>  XC = 100-10 = 90 <br>  MCMLXXXIV = 1000+(1000-100)+50+30+(5-1) = 1984

That every "asset" he has, lures them in. Perhaps the point of having a power is to assist with that concept as well. Also, they usually get those attributes because a trait from their human life intensified with the vamp. transformation. (Ex. Alice had premonitions in her human life, Jasper could make people feel how he wants them- to an extent, Edward could "read" people.)<br>  <br>  P.s. The God complex doesn't seem too far off. S.

njrKjJVwaa	The Fajr Prayer Time<br>  It begins at the end of the night when the horizontal line of light appears in the horizon. Not the earlier vertical light. The Fajr Prayer time hands when the disk of the sun first appears on the horizon with reference to a flat landscape.<br>  <br>  The Thuhr Prayer Time<br>  It begins once the sun has passed the midpoint of the sky, and the shadow has started moving towards the east. The Thuhr Prayer time ends when the length of the shadow of all things becomes equal to the length of the thing itself, after having subtracted the length of the shadow when the sun is in the midpoint of the sky.

The rat race isn't what it's cracked up to be.|`|1yxPfC0Jaa	Count me in as long as it's Not HS seniors!|`|HZgjUguWaa	a trip to NYC doesn't interest me.|`|YBRQsmLMaa	I'm looking for a senior citizen American gf to sponsor me for one|`|KWwW7N49aa	In my area, they have daily bus rides to New York City for the day for only $25.00 (one-way).  I am thinking of doing it this spring.  Check your local senior citizen center as they may offer it as well.  Have fun!|`|8G42oyydaa	What is the exact question? I seem to be missing something.
ee30c12fc32e951b85fac3bf9bc65f25aa	Perhaps it's because they are afraid you will die.  It has nothing to do with you being brave enough.  I think it's a question of us at home being brave enough to face the fact that our loved ones in the armed forces may die.  So if they can talk you out of it maybe they won't have to face it.|`|RDeYnyxQaa	What they might be giving is a warning you could die fighting someone else's war in the name of some (often lost) 'cause' supported by politicians, some with ulterior motives or just corrupt, rather than defending your country directly.
u33x2hqzaa	Maybe the life we want is not the one that will really make us happy?<br>  <br>  Tears are intertwined with love and remind us of our humanity.<br>  <br>  Unless you have xray vision and can spy into the heart of another, do not assume that they are better off than you.<br>  <br>  Suffering is a mystery and yet one that can open the heart with compassion towards others.  To live is to suffer.  To live is also to experience joy. They are 2 sides of the same coin that is life.  Try to cherish the good, endure the bad, and realize everyone has their cross to bear.<br>  <br>  Edit: Right on Adam F, right on!|`|AA11104965	If you allow your happiness to depend on others, you will always eventually be disappointed.<br>  <br>  The only thing you can really control is yourself.  If you truly desire happiness, seek it within.|`|dKgkHZf3aa	If you suffer for something and finally get it, does that not allow you to love it even more?  I think the more you suffer, the more gradittude you can have for overcoming it.  The most ungrateful and unloving people I know are those who have suffered little and gotten everything they want.|`|6ypnDnvLaa	You have three meals a day. And you are on the internets. (a luxury few enjoy) <br>  On top of that, God will pay you back with an eternity of happiness(if you trust in Jesus). Think about it: ∞moments of joy.  I wish I could fully realize what that means.  <br>  Don't worry, God is at the steering wheel.  Don't jump out the car.  He's taking good care of you.  You can count on him more than a (spouse, parent, etc).|`|AA11124121	Sorry pard.<br>  <br>  Suffering actually makes us stronger.<br>  <br>  Remember, that which doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.|`|67EaIAvbaa	1-what have you given?<br>  2-you don't..that's a choice people make<br>  3-because it cleanses our pain<br>  4-there is nobody better off than me..now that i have Jesus...do you?|`|AA11375099	KARMA!|`|SPNHhFXoaa	So God can get his lulz.|`|ZZ4tkytYaa	Jer 29:11 (NIV) "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."<br>  Jeremiah 29:11 is thus a ray of hope in this dark world--not of short-term success and prosperity, but rather that after the just sentence of God has passed... we will be restored.|`|Tx5mlO8Aaa	These are destructive thoughts.

AA10506154	Last name goes first.<br>  How about Takahashi Nana<br>  Taka(高)=high hashi(橋)=bridge<br>  Which Nana are you using? I like 菜々...<br>  菜の花 is a really pretty little flower, and tasty too. It's edible.<br>  Incase you're wondering what the 々 is, it's used when the second letter is the same as the next. Kinda like how in English you would write two lines under a word if it's just like the word above.|`|0tXcfq0waa	I think Nana Matsuoka would be nice but i'm not sure what it means...sorry! hope this ateleast gives you an idea!:)
CwNMq7RTaa	leave people alone.  let them do it for themselves.
EmOnt7FIaa	Yes, I've noticed that as well. Other black people, for some reason, want to distinguish themselves from the rest of Americans for who knows what reason? This seems to be a relatively new trend and this isn't bringing the black community any further. I talk the same when I'm around my white, black and hispanic friends.|`|AA10855383	I used to do the same thing.. and its basically to prove a point (for me at least..). I speak ebonics to people that understand it, but I also know how to speak correctly. So.... but yeah. I used to speak ebonics throughout middle school, high school, college, but not much now (Its the real world now, so.. go figure). And English class was not my weakness in school, either. It was actually one of my best, next to the sciences. We're not the only people who use slang, even the Spanish language has slang, and each country uses their own words that someone from another Latin-American country would not understand. (I'm bilingual).|`|HimBbU6caa	I see this differently. There is nothing wrong with your friend adapting and adjusting to her environment. She is not a "sell out" just because she uses standard English around people who will understand her. Moreover, just because she uses Ebonics around her black friends it doesn't mean that they are not capable or willing to use or comprehend standard English. It's called versatility. I can go to Bed Stuy to see my cousin and fit right in perfectly. When I go to work it's standard English because I am in a professional environment. <br>  <br>  It's sort of like my best friend who is Filipino. He speaks 2 dialects of his native tongue, and uses the dialect that best helps him communicate with the parties involved. He has more of an advantage than a Filipino who only speaks Togolog.|`|da4zS4AOaa	Maybe if she talks to blacks the way she talks to white she'd be considered you know that word people say "sell-out". I used to be like her especially when I go to a black salon. I realized I was stupid cause I can't really talk "ebonics" it won't sound right. It'll look like I'm trying too hard. These days I talk to everyone the same way. <br>  <br>  My accent is a mixture of where I'm from (mother land :) and how whites talk (because when I came here I grew up around them).<br>  <br>  Exactly what the girl above said "she's trying to fit in"|`|ncdTxID9aa	Some people do that yes, I don't use ebonics but my black cousins like when I do, but they as well as I speak just English. When I speak to foreigners I talk like they do a little with broken English because they understand it better. People who can sort of mimic others can communicate better with almost anyone.|`|yjctHwzAaa	i have noticed that with some people, maybe shes just tryin to fit in.|`|AS4RZKY3aa	EAT SH!T CRACKER. YOU ARE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH TO LICK THE VAGINA OF A BLACK WOMAN! <br>  <br>  YOU NEED TO TAKE YOUR FILTHY TONGUE AND SUCKLE THE JUICES FROM THE CL!T OF A BLACK WOMAN YOU COWARD!<br>  <br>  WHITE P#SSY IS NASTY LICK A BLACK P#SSY.<br>  <br>  WHITE WOMEN HAVE GREEN PIMPLES IN THEIR P#SSY!|`|FATyhyZ2aa	I lived in the ghetto once & became friends w/ a black male who was very educated & well spoken as I helped him w/ his classes.  He got a knock on the door.  Made me hide, threw a blanket over his text books, opened the door & talked gangsta" w/ his Bro's.  When thy left, I asked what that was all about.  He said, "You don't understand what it's like for a Brother to want to make something of his life in this place.  If they found out I was going to school, they'd think that I was trying to be better than them or was selling out to the white-man.  It can be tough.  It could even be deadly." -- I'm sure that's not all reasons b/c this was a VERY tough ghetto.  No whites, like me, so the black lady who took me in always had to pretend I was "bright," & keep a tight curl in my naturally curly hair.  /  But all races do this.  If I'm doing court work I have clear enunciation, but when speaking to a fellow Texan, I'll relax & let the drawl come out.  Go for a home visit to the hills of Georgia & it's drawl to the 10th power!|`|Uy58ixnvaa	It depends on what she's more comfortable with. That sometimes happens with me; I tend to use more ebonics around the family. But the way I type and the way I talk most of the time is usually in perfect grammar.<br>  <br>  Think of this way: suppose your friend was Hispanic. Naturally she would speak in Spanish around other Hispanics, and speak in English around you. Maybe your friend is just being accomodating and thinks that's the language you're most comfortable with.|`|nsQ4fPqpaa	She probably doesn't want to sound condescending. Like Calpurnia in To Kill a Mockingbird. Good book.|`|v6QA809aaa	maybe she feels more at ease when she is with people of her kind
ENAEcBOmaa	same thing with Asian girls and white guys. they are so much more common than Asian guys and white girls.
46fouwFfaa	I'm not too sure how other cultures got their names but I know that the rough meaning of Somali is "milk the camel". Camel milk is a delicacy in Somalia and Somalis would often offer their guests camel milk which was their way of being hospitable. So foreigners would call them the "Somali". <br>  <br>  Just find out what the center of the lives of your culture's people is. Are they farmers, city folk, nomads? What are the popular sayings and their customs? Then make up words in their language for it and use it to name your culture.|`|rRfV3Pmuaa	cultures get their named based on words, their language, religion and meanings of different words and etc.|`|18d85be6c3c9c020fcc70cb27704105caa	Ok im thinking it  has alot to do with location  and spiritual  beliefs  .it would help if  i had some idea what kind of culture you wanted to create in order to name it . And the good thing about names is the is really no right or wrong if your the one picking the name its you that makes that decision .

Ow6lKFXiaa	Basically, because most people just don't have a clue.  As you say, they don't make sense.  I was born with a Jewish heritage.  My best friend was Italian American.  Whenever anyone asked what we were, she always said, "I'm Italian, and she's Jewish.  It drove me crazy.  Jewish was my religious heritage, not my race nor my ethnic heritage. Most people just don't understand the differences of religious, racial, ethnic or cultural heritage so they tend to mix them up and use them interchangeably.  You're not alone, it drives me crazy, too.|`|PpaaRkm9aa	Because REAL Japanese are Asian.|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	Humans have been operating in this confused way for millions of years.<br>  <br>  Human babies begin operating with Mother, then learn Family, then Tribe. After that, they are lost in a quagmire of people who are strangers because they are "outside of my learned tribe," meaning that these new people are culturally, ethnically, genetically, visually (race), intellectually, nationally, politically, religiously, economically, or otherwise different.<br>  <br>  The end result of this confusion is that unscrupulous war lords can take advantage of this, and create hostile differences between groups to gain political advantage.

3Anq8K32aa	My daughter has speech issues and I had to teach it to her and I knew nothing about it so I started in the library in the kids section because in order to learn the language you need to start from the begining. They have lots of books "simple signs" is one they also have videos that can help and they more you know from the simple words the easier it gets to be able to put sentences together. That's if you want to go at your own pace and not be rushed.  When you are rushed with sign you easily forget it.<br>  To be very honest most of it is common since. for example.....<br>  "cookie" do it as  you read it and you will understand what I mean<br>  put one hand out like someone is going to give you 5 and then with the other hand make it look like you have your hand around a pickle jar and the put the pickle jar hand over the other and turn back and forth as if you were using a cookie cutter.<br>  ya get it? there are a lot that way. good luck|`|0NCyqe2Qaa	Ask some Hearing Impaired folks to help you learn.|`|6VL5xzlAaa	If your in england theres evening classes at alot of colleges, theres also a series of dvd for it and a BSL book with diagrams that is really good for the alphabet and vocab words!|`|ltqiMaA8aa	I take sign language at my school, and there are deaf events you can attend (so you can observe and get to know the language)<br>  <br>  also you can look online at websites or buy some sign language movies - there are a lot of really good ones [my teacher always shows us movies, and they are really helpful]

People would recognize negative issues before recognizing the positive. With our imperfections as humans we have the inborn inclinations to be selfish only wanting others to believe what we believe. Therefore we take any negative situation we can and use it as a tool to discourage anyone from wanting to learn what anyone else's religion is about. Everyone has been there at one point or another, having negative thoughts about ones belief because of what they heard. I believe that there is only One True God as well as one true religion to serve him. But as long as we keep letting negative views control the way we think, we would never be able to serve The Only True God, together as a world in unity.|`|0KtFtnZVaa	Have you spoken to most Americans? Not all Americans are Christian, many are Muslim.<br>  <br>  Most Americans do not care. The media in islamic nations paints us as Muslim haters but truth be told we don't really care what you believe. Not because we hate you but because we have more pressing concerns in our personal life to worry about than what people 4000 miles away believe. <br>  <br>  We are not overly fond of terrorist who hurt people in the name of Allah, but we are not so stupid as to believe those fanatics actually represent real Islamic Values.|`|0Ye3d4C3aa	because its easy to pass judgemnet about something you know little about.|`|gGd3v3M5aa	Probably because most people jump to conclusions about Americans.|`|QdwMhvpCaa	It's called propaganda. People always need to fear and/or hate something. People tend to misjudge things, like Christianity. Not all Christians are bad, just as not all Muslims are bad. It's just a few jerks that make everyone else in the group look bad, and as a result, the nice people get treated poorly.

lHzBJA4eaa	All that says to me is 81% of guys will lie if they think it'll get them somewhere with a girl.

Call me lame, but I like it when a girl shows she's interested and informed in current events, politics, philosophy etc.  <br>  <br>  However, if the instinctive physical attraction isn't there, then I probably would never stick around long enough to actually learn how a girl thinks.  If we were just friends, I wouldn''t care how she looked.  But for any type of romance, physical attraction is a prerequisite for me.  <br>  <br>  Sorry.  I wish I wasn't so shallow, but I am.|`|Bn8luyPXaa	intelligence is much more important than beauty but beauty does help attract a guy in the first place.|`|nsQ4fPqpaa	There's an actual statistic on all men out of more than 6 billion people in the world?

Think how much money is obtained from drug busts.|`|nsQ4fPqpaa	because it provides an escape from reality and feels good.<br>  <br>  & because of classical conditioning.|`|x4LYGAIkaa	Some do it to relieve stress, others because they feel good while doing it and get addicted, for ritual purposes. Drug use varies from culture to culture, many use drugs are used for rituals; they alter ones perceptions, and makes them feel more "alive." In this sense, drugs are used for spiritual purposes, and can apparently be quite a trip, sometimes giving people epiphanies, and curing them of some problems. But some people are stupid and abuse drugs, and disregard their power. What kind of drugs are they using, most likely they are illegal. You should be careful, maybe not the best place to be, lest get caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.

AA10532298	It certainly seems as though those that cheat and lie get ahead in life, while more ethical folk are left behind. Personally, I have chosen he ethical life. I do not live in a mansion, and nor do I have every material thing that I could want. But I have things that cannot be bought with money. I have the loyalty and love of my friends. I can honestly say that I have never lacked a place to stay in the worst of times, never have I ever gone hungry. Many times, those very friends have provided me with what I need, and I have done the same for them. That to me is worth more than anything that can be bought with money.|`|nsQ4fPqpaa	I do not think that honesty is always the best policy.<br>  <br>  It all depends on context.

I'm thinking blacks will also continue to go Dem long after Obama is gone.|`|QLYpq7Zhaa	I hate to rain on your stereotype parade, but I've been voting in every election since I was 18.  Not just Presidential either.  State, county, city, Senate, Gubernatorial, you name it.  All black people are not the same.  There are those of every race that don't vote.|`|p8Mc6rpBaa	Speaking for myself only I started voting way before President Obama ran for office. Also I did vote a straight ticket. Therefore I personally will always vote. This same question could be posed to disenchanted Republicans that when faced with candidates not of their liking historically they have stayed home. Therefore you could ask White Republicans who stayed at home and did not vote, if the Republican party nominates a Black candidate for the 2012 presidential election will they stay at home again because the candidate is Black? I'm sure you know and have heard White Republicans say that there is no way they could bring themselves to vote for a Black man.|`|4hiMgHMCaa	Like i've said before, the black population isn't large enough in America to have someone win an election with just them voting for that person. Second, other black people have ran for president in the past, so if there was gonna be a black president, it could've happened a long time ago, so that's how you know this wasn't based entirely off race. Third, lots of middle and working class whites voted for Obama too, not just blacks. Fourth, some of you people are always complaining that blacks don't care about anything, but then when we do get involved, it has to be a dirty reason behind it. Fifth, white people have been basing mostly everything off race since America first started to progress as a country, so don't jump on us for 1 thing. Sixth, this election is the first time whites are getting technical about what ethnicity someone is supposed to be, so who is dwelling on race the most now? Seventh, why are you still addressing this, because the election is over! If Obama sucks while he's in office, i won't vote for him the next time. And i wasn't old enough to vote the first time. Enough said.|`|iWaU76T5aa	I voted for Obama just because I wanted to contribute to History but believe me, I will be voting Republican next election if Mitt Romney runs and gets the nomination.|`|da3f31f0285fe3fe3296aa9f25dca37eaa	Well, I did not vote for Obama because I don't agree with much of what he stands for.  So his win was bitter sweet for me.  Yes I was glad to see someone other than the "typical president" get into office, but I don't like Obama's politics.  As for the voting thing, I think you are making a serious generalization.  Yes some blacks never voted before and only voted this time because Obama was running, but I don't think that is the case for most of us.  As far as them saying there was no reason to vote before, it could stem from the fact that some blacks (not most) feel defeated and unrepresented by the system and don't feel that their vote stands for anything.  And I must say it is not just blacks who feel this way.|`|AA10597919	Did u see how many people were at his ceremony? Were they all black? First of all it's was not a good time to be a republican to run in the presidential election. But regardless of political party, a lot of black people didn't vote, and there could've been some that voted for him because he's black. But i wouldn't say that for the majority. So no generalizing.|`|aGOBuJtKaa	I will vote even when he is out of office. For me, the state of the economy was my inspiration to get out and vote. I didn't vote during the Bush/Kerry administration, so I basically lost my chance to complain about anything that was going on. I was actually rooting for Hilary, but since Obama clinched the candidacy, I jumped on board with him because Hilary supported him.|`|HimBbU6caa	Honestly, this was the first time so many white people voted for a candidate of color on such a grand scale. Do you know how many white people went to work and claimed to be voting for McCain and then voted for Obama when showtime came? I dislike all politicians, so I can play the neutral role here. This election was unique because it was filled with so many unusual dynamics. The bottom line is that if Bush's popularity numbers are anywhere close to 50 % Obama doesn't see the White House, because whites would not have gone out to vote for him. The white vote put Obama in office.<br>  <br>  Edit: TLC nailed this answer. Outstanding answer. I'm impressed.|`|ncdTxID9aa	Here we go, few black people atone for all black people.  Not every black person is a Democrat, so not every black person voted for Obama. Did you care that Clinton got 96% of the Black voted win he won?  No you didn't.  I didn't vote, and most of my family Black and White are Conservative or Republican.|`|AA10232076	Some people, yes that's probably how it's going to be. But, people like my parents, who have been voting since the first election they were old enough to vote in (Jimmy Carter) will continue to vote after Obama is out of office.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	woooooow - I'm offended - and I'm whiter than snow. <br>  <br>  You should probably learn how to word your questions a little better. Unless of course you want people to think you're a racist.<br>  <br>  Sorry McCain didn't win.|`|8RmazUuBaa	Black turnout wasnt any higher than usual you numbnuts..Young people had the record  turnout|`|HenWgGkFaa	It's an exaggeration to say "a ton" of black people voted for the first time. Many celebs are idiots, black or white, so you can't really use them as a barometer for the general population. Regarding the small percentage of black people who voted for the first time in '08, I can't say what they'll do in the future, and it was sad if their main motivation was that they consider Obama black. All of the black people I know have been very active in the political process for as long as I can remember. I don't care about any politician's skintone; I look at his/her platform, associations and financial backers.|`|7gH7sgi6aa	I think you have this a bit twisted.  I know many upper class people who voted for Obama because they were sick of what the Republicans had done in the past 8 years.  They feared for money they had invested and the money they usually "lived" off of that came from investments disappearing.  They saw the infrastructure of the American Banking system failing and knew that many who had more than the FDIC insured amount in the bank had something to worry about.<br>  I also know many middle class Americans both Republican and Democrat that were tired of being the "ignored" class.  They understood that they were quickly being pushed into the lower class by higher taxes and gas prices and "living" in general.  They knew if something wasn't done many of them would lose their homes to foreclosure and no one was even blinking an eye over the scenario.<br>  I think your statement was generalized and sounded very uneducated.  You cannot take a race and say how and why they voted.  Perhaps then you can blame the whites for the mess President Bush left us in when he left office?  <br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|J3UmD1zCaa	Im not old enough to vote but the next election, I will be able to vote and that will be for who I think is the better candidate not if we share the same race.|`|xxgx0IVAaa	IF YOU CAN VOTE BUT CHOOSE NOT TO GO LAUGH IN THE GRAVES AND FACES OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT DIED TO GIVE YOU THAT RIGHT!
AA10187219	They check the title and registration.  <br>  <br>  No one, including Christians, Jews, or Muslims should take 'Noah's Ark found!' stories too seriously.

One message I got was in life when we have done wrong and we get a chance to clean the slate we must seize the chance at redemption. The other message I got from this movie is never judge a book by it's cover. Deep down inside we all have something in common. Also what I got is when faced with choices the right choice will always prevail despite personal feelings or ideologies...<br>  <br>  <br>  I didn't see the decline in the White population but rather a change of ages. Clint Eastwood represented the industrial age and his son represented the information age. Clint Eastwood represented a dying era. That doesn't necessarily equate to decreasing population..|`|S6MqrWdjaa	1 no it implied racism in america and azn gangs vs azn culture<br>  2 2030<br>  3 border hopping and immigration<br>  4 in due time but a way longer due time.<br>  <br>  edit ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww my face is up there peevert go jack off to techno.....im changing my avatar i hate these peeeeeeeeeeeeverts.|`|JLg8XNUCaa	One message I got is that he gave his life to save others.

If you draw near to Him, He will draw near to you.|`|AA11375099	no.<br>  <br>  Your faith is all you need, if you believe it.  Whatever you believe you need you need.  It is up to you.|`|ujzkiqU0aa	uhhh yeah..if you want to go to heaven u better get saved its the only way..i kno ill get a lot of thumbs down..buts its true.|`|2rJwgk40aa	No,I have Stephen King.He confuses me enough.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	I'm the same way.....For the hell of it I ask question on Bible stories that couldn't have happened for entertainment.|`|Bv3Dm11paa	Hmm... depends on what kind of relationship you want with God. <br>  <br>  If you want to know what he thinks you should probably read it...<br>  <br>  If you don't want to know what he thinks don't read it...<br>  <br>  Do you pray? Because if you pray and don't read the bible you've got a bit of a one-sided relationship. Think about it, would you like someone talking to you and asking your help and your opinion and guidance and when you give it to them they wont read it because they don't think it's relevant? Also even the most hard out religious dude will tell you that you can never ever ever stop getting freshness out of the word.|`|AA11149408	Yes, I do..........I can't remember word for word everything that my own hubby ( or coworker) said to me today.  I have to ask for reminders and clarification.<br>  <br>  I could not even hope to remember every word or instruction that God has given to me, to last for my lifetime.  Yes, I do need the written reminder.  ( I have even been known to bake a 'birthday cake' on the wrong day!)<br>  <br>  Even though I know "of" God, I can't commit His every word to memory.<br>  On some level I think that is why He had it recorded!|`|AA10747877	Maybe you don't, but I sure do and I am grateful to God for loving me enough to enable me to have it. It costs many people their lives to make sure we can have the Word of God in a language we can understand. There are people in other countries who would give almost anything to be able to own a Bible.|`|8PLee1wzaa	Yeah, the Bible has so much practical wisdom.  For family life, personal problems, how to cope with the strees of this system of things.  And just how to remain happy . The true word of peace.  The book shows the way to get close to God.  You cant do that if youre not serving him like he wants to be served, and if the nonbelivers put down the scientific fact they'll say that the Bible really does show us how to love one another and truly gain peace.   <br>  <br>  <br>  Thanks|`|pa8vbP5taa	I am not religious, so I cannot tell you if you need the "bible". However, my impression of the bible is that it's a set of directions that help you to navigate through life.|`|oopg697aaa	Nope you don't need a Bible....Bible is just a book of history and bunch of people and their views...don't mean it applies to all the rest of us. If you can connect with God on your own than who needs the Bible....|`|Wao6e8G2aa	you really do because it helps you in life,being a better person and it helps you get to heaven. your life will change into a beautiful and long life|`|450539d29675dc973b0ec09791ed6c66aa	The Bible is a very important part of my life so yes I need the Bible in my everyday life.|`|AA11989753	Man shall not live by bread alone but by EVERY WORD that proceedeth from the mouth of God. Matthew 4:4<br>  <br>  I cannot live without the word of God. Yes, I NEED my Bible to LIVE!|`|KcAehrrKaa	Not necessarily.|`|cbNPsb1Naa	No, but several people in this world do because they are weak minded. Sorry.|`|phDTu7c1aa	No, it's just there when you feel ready to use it.|`|SavvSFIXaa	Yes, I'm out of toilet paper.|`|cic4J2hzaa	well ya...you think the world is lost now imagine what it would be without the bible....|`|akGDhUGfaa	Paper weight?|`|txEMWye4aa	I believe you do its a good guide on how to live your so that you can be closer to god. Also its a very interesting book that can help you in many different ways it also has some very good interesting stories that can maybe help you through something your facing in life.|`|iMyvTY7uaa	Wow, sounds like you know everything about God?  So, that must mean you know everything He said in His Word....the Bible.  Without the Bible, how do you know whether you're going to Heaven or Hell when you die?  You gonna trust your own conscious or man, or some church or religion to tell you where you're going to go?  When you wake up in Hell after you die, it'll be too late to ponder...."Hmm, I wonder why I ended up here and I wonder what God said in his Word (the Bible) about how I can prevent going to Hell?|`|YvvcsdUUaa	Yes. it answers many frequently asked questions. and people who may disagree its most likely because they dont try to read it. Its a guide to inner peace. It soothes. It calms and you learn.

7gH7sgi6aa	I do always say it and do it out of common courtesy and respect.  I always treat others the way I expect or would like them to treat me.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|ljpAMZbmaa	Well, the simple reason is people say please and thank you, because it's a sign of respect. When you are saying please and thank you it's showing who you really  are, your not a bad person, and it's very polite. If you are not saying these polit words, then most likly people will think of you in a different kind of way, more like a bad person, or someone who was not taught properly. Sometimes it sets off a example for your parents, and how you were raised. Its just like  smacking in a bad way at the dinner table. I think this is why people say please and thank you!!! I hope this helped you out on your question.|`|LcdaUleUaa	I do it out of pure habit at this stage - and I know that because every once and a while I'll say please or thankyou at an inappropriate time because I wasn't paying attention.<br>  <br>  But I'm very glad I have the habit because I think it's a healthy part of life to show these kinds of formalities.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	I say them because I show respect for others kindness. Respect is the key word.|`|gspTDufpaa	Yes my parents instilled manners in me daily.|`|BIgj6h6oaa	I do it out of habit, now. Whenever I'm accepting something, walking through a door they've opened, or receiving a compliment, I ALWAYS say thank you. However, I'm not as good with the "please" I tend to forget that. <br>  <br>  Frankly, I feel like I don't get thanked enough for what I do for my friends/family, so I guess it stems from that. :)|`|Uy58ixnvaa	I say it all the time, mainly because my parents and my first 2 years of schooling sort of drill it in my brain, but often times I really mean it. So I would say it's half and half. <br>  <br>  Thank you, <br>  Paralyzer.|`|72iZuDjeaa	i do very well with please,,, thank you is another story... if please worked then why do you need to say thank you too ;-p lol|`|AcFBETxAaa	Naww, not all the time.

(14 is a great year!)|`|fGTWNtQPaa	Happy Birthday!!!!!|`|xvekZJhfaa	gosh ppl just demand these days.. lol...HAPPY BIRFDAY HUN|`|CmLDcfMfaa	Happy Birthday to you<br>  Just one will not due.<br>  Born again means salvation, <br>  How many have you? <br>  <br>  To celebrate your second birth Jesus said you must be born again.  To be born not of the flesh but of the spirit.<br>  <br>  As it is written, there is none righteous, not even one…. Romans 3:10<br>  <br>  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 6:23<br>  <br>  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16.<br>  <br>  Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him and sup with him and he with me. Revelation 3:20<br>  <br>  As many as received him, to them he gave the power to become children of God, even to them that believe on his name. John 1:12<br>  <br>  Repent therefore, and be converted that your sins may be blotted out and that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord. Acts 3:19<br>  <br>  …that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that <br>  God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved. Rom. 10:9<br>  <br>  If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. II Corinthians 5:17<br>  <br>  So, when you are ready, you can let Jesus in your heart. You must repent and ask forgiveness and ask Jesus to be your Savior and Lord of your life. If you do that sincerely you will be born again. God bless you and keep you!

iHLt9Juyaa	It's so hard to picture with our limited minds, but I think we will feel peace like we never imagined. We will see colors that our earthly eyes can't see and taste and smell things unlike anything we have seen on earth. Kent Hovind (the great creationist and Evangelist) put it into a very neat perspective. He said: "Imagine tasting the color blue, or watching the notes coming from music, or smelling them." <br>  I can't imagine all of God's dimensions, but I certainly look forward to them!<br>  God bless you.|`|QthaexfIaa	i picture heaven as a wonderful place where the good souls live on and enjoy their afterlife and live their afterlife without pain. i picture it as a place where you meet the eyes of jesus and he forgives your sins. i also believe it is the place where you find the truth.|`|RFuWnx00aa	very pretty and very shinny and filled with precious gems everywhere.. it pretty much describes it in revalations.. :) it always amazes me when i read it..<br>  but yep.. very very very pretty and very very amazing.. with lots of yummy food :) and lots of angels and lots of people recognizing eachother :D|`|PITPLsx2aa	I'll take the word of what the Bible says, gold, pearly gate.... but if you want more Don Piper was declared dead in a head on car crash and talks some about what he saw in heaven but mostly about his recovery in the material below.   A Baptist Minister came upon the crash and felt that he had to pray for the "dead guy", a very strange thing for a Baptist!  So he got in the crushed car (the body was still crushed in the car) and started to pray and then sang the hymn "What a friend we have in Jesus" and when he got to the part that says "because we do not take everything to God in prayer" Don started to sing along.  Apparently the minister had some problems convincing the ambulance and police that "the dead guy is singing".

Revelations also speaks of streets of gold and that your tears are handed to you in a bottle upon reaching Heaven. No one in Heaven will ever have need to cry again, therefore, your tears from Earth are precious. Jesus also said, "In my father's house there are many mansions. I am going there to provide a place for you." Never can remember the exact reference though.|`|SaPJlK7Qaa	I always imagine the golden gates and clouds!!!!

My best friend's grandparents passed away.  I had always wanted to meet them.  About ten months ago, she moved to another state and everyday I say a prayer for her and ask them to look out for her.  A couple of weeks ago, I had the most vivid dream.  I went to a farm house.  It was pure comfort.  I was greeted by a gentleman who said that he had been waiting to meet me.  He held out his hand and wrapped it around mine as though I were a child.  He shook my hand and introduced me around.  He then took me out into the farmyard and told me that he was going to tell my friend that he had finally met me.  He held his arms up to the sky and his whole body turned to light.  My alarm went off and it was all gone.

I usually try to get up within a few minutes, or I lay there and get so many things on my mind from the past, or what is going on in our family now that it starts to make me more blue. There are a lot of happy memories, and I try to think of those, but there are many sad ones, and of people that are gone, and I miss, just like others that have friends and family they miss.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	No, I usually have two little dogs ready to lick me when I wake up.<br>  So I can't lay around long. I do my day dreaming, in the computer<br>  chair. Usually after reading something nostalgic and it makes me<br>  think back to those days. I only remember certain things now. And I<br>  occasionally do relive them. Remembering family members, and<br>  my best friend, and some neighbor kids also. But mostly, I like to<br>  think about my grandma, since she was a special person to me.<br>  And when I went to stay with her, when I was little, she made me<br>  feel very special that I was there with her. She made me feel that I<br>  was the only one, so special to her, and I cherished the bond we<br>  had between us.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	At night when I first get into bed, I lie there and say my prayers. . . these are usually for my present day friends and family. . I don't think too much about the school friends from the past.. . . seems like once we graduated and spread out, we became just that,  the past.  I think I have only ever seen 3 or 4 of them since that time.  But I do think about my friends even here on Yahoo. . . I have all these little avatars running around in my brain. . . even the generic shadow people, but they all have names, and they populate my dreams.  What is funny is some of them are dogs. . .or even a big blue eye ball . . . lol  lol|`|O9FojdEMaa	not only in bed but yes and i find myself remembering people from my first grade class all the way through college.|`|WbKBHh8Haa	many times|`|2R3iJnFPaa	Yes, I'm doing that more and more these days.|`|iuWfp2fEaa	Yes, I have. Sometimes I wonder where they are now.|`|SDHmVDlNaa	No not in bed but often when I am driving.  I do think about my old pals and enemies from grade school.  I can't remember their names any more. First names are still in my head but their last names escape me now.  One fat little blond girl I was thinking about the other day used to make my life a living hell when I walked home from school by making fun of my name.  I bet she is all grown up and still making someones life miserable now.  Oh well can't remember everything.  Wish I could think of her last name so I could Google her and send her a stink bomb!  Guess there is only so much room in my head though.  I do wonder if they are still alive and what they ended up doing for a living.  Some of them were, shall we say, rough around the edges.  There were a few I was pretty sure would end up in prison.|`|24vQ8D71aa	yes, also looking at class photos, i wonder where they are now ? maybe someone is famous,or rich or an axe murderer ,most of them would have grand kids by now,maybe someone lives only 2 streets away, how many are in different countries? .......is that bully still a bully , would that boy who had a crush on me like me now? .....better stop now ,getting to nostalgic :) <br>  thanks for the good question .a star for you.|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	All th time Clifford.  I wonder what happened to them if they no longer live here.  I wonder if they married, had children and are happy.  I then begin thinking about some of the crazy stuff we pulled and begin to laugh out loud.  Hubby rolls over and just says "geez, there you go again".  I will sometimes relive softball and volleyball league games.  The mind just wonders.|`|147b4a346dd471babe83771bba6a0923aa	Hey, C.W.!<br>  Yes. (Why is that?) <br>  Apart from my still-close friends -all 3 of them-<br>  out of all the kids in all the classes - for THIRTEEN years! - <br>  (counting Kindergarten) <br>  I can only remember about a dozen or so. <br>  (?) };>|`|VBdXray0aa	Yes.

Lots of praying going on for the now days ones.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	No, I usually don't think about people while I'm lying in bed.  Usually I'm wondering why it is that when I finally get to sleep in as late as I want, I always have to get up and use the bathroom (after which the bed will have gotten cold again and I might as well get dressed and be awake).  Otherwise, I wake up and have to get up to go to work or out to do chores or meet someone or something.|`|IWyrJ7o3aa	Yes i sure do more & more every day, I wonder where they are and what they are doing , if they fulfilled their dreams. How many our still with us. Some I really miss. I can get really melancholy thinking about everyone.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	I have indeed.

Just last night, I was trying to remember all my elementary school teachers.
U5zcbHuZaa	Oh, I just went through a rough time where I had a downfall in my optimism, but I turned to Allah for protection, guidance, and deliverance, and put in extra and more earnest prayer and low and behold, the fog has started to lift. It is not that I didn't turn to Allah before, but I have started a new thing of repeating the essential knowledge I need to keep in mind to avoid negativity. I know I won't always be able to, that's not realistic, but I keep repeating to myself several times a day, Allah is my protector, Allah will deliver me, so I will have it ready to say as a habit the next time a major stress incident threatens. So far last 2-3 days, with a number of small stressors, so good, but the tougher test has not come. In the meantime, I prepare for it by continuing to repeat this essential knowledge that must be at the forefront of my mind the next time a major stress or anxiety threatens.|`|7dGpL4mSaa	Very easy. I'm optimistic most of the time!|`|kkO87h0Xaa	It's pretty easy when I think about people who have it a lot worse than me. I mean, would they want me moping around half my life when I have all the basic necessities they're unable to have? I think not.

QrSFskUpaa	I understand what you said...at the end of the conversation, you could say: "bye, it was nice talking to you, have a good day".|`|WoRaXE73aa	I find I am better--and my words more measured--when I know that the goodbye is coming and I can briefly jot down those thoughts in a note card or on a piece of paper. That way, all I have to do is hand it to them, and when asked, I tell them it's the goodbye that I struggled to say. And hug them. It often makes it easier in many ways.

8a2ebc183110448f4c3847d3aa539174aa	Yes its a pentacle, but no it does not mean you worship the devil. <br>  <br>  The pentacle is an ancient symbol that has been used to for protection.<br>  The points represent the 5 elements (earth, wind, water, fire, metal) the circle connects them and binds them together drawing strength from them all.<br>  <br>   In some places, wiccans have informally adopted the symbol to represent their own faith, but the symbol itself is much much older than that.<br>  <br>  Also, wiccans do not worship the devil either. Its mostly an earthy religion that focuses on peace and care for the planet. <br>  <br>  If the necklace symbol was reversed  with 2 points at the top instead of one, it is called a pentagram. That has been associated with the sign of the horned devil, and is connected with satan worship. But it looks and is completely different then the necklace your boyfriend gave you.<br>  <br>  Ultimately no one can make you worship the devil, if you are a christian and happy with your religion then you have nothing to worry about. if you like the necklace then wear it and enjoy it. <br>  <br>  Personally I think its very sweet that he gave it to you, and its a very pretty necklace.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|oqiH3fCCaa	It could be associated with the our friend Sa+an but not necessarily. It could be wicc@n, or from other early pag@n religions. I suggest that you ask your boyfriend about it's origins and purpose, I'm sure he would be willing to shed some light. Is he Christian himself? Do you know what religion he is if not Christian? If you are uneasy about the pentacle then you don't need to wear it and your boyfriend should respect this if he really loves you. I would like to say that the wicc@n religion isn't at all what it is made out to be and not evil or anything. As far as how you handle the outcome, just do what you feel comfortable with. If he does worship Sa+an and you don't feel comfortable with him anymore then maybe this isn't the best relationship for you. If you are willing to put his beliefs to the side then good for you. Lastly, I think that the necklace is very smexy and handsome looking. Don't let others put you down for wearing it, if you want to wear it then who cares what others think of it.|`|WjSJBWl7aa	Mkay my ex boyfriend gave me a pentagram necklace for my birthday a few years ago.<br>  <br>  I am really interested in the occult and all that..but I swear to god it brought me bad luck. While I was wearing it I had extremely bad luck.. and I only realised it after I threw it away [fight with ex] and things got great again.<br>  <br>  I recently bought another [It was along time ago..I forgot what happened] and I was plagued by bad luck again.. three floods and freak storms within a week, our horse died out of nowhere, our old house that we were trying to sell got flooded by a freak storm [unconnected to the ones at the new house], a fire on my dad's property, we got a phonecall saying the potential new owners of the old house had backed out of the deal..<br>  <br>  As soon as I threw it away, the reports of further storms changed to blue skies and the phone rang within an hour to say our house suddenly sold.<br>  <br>  I'm happy to admit it could be coincidence.. but I'm not so sure.. it was too convenient..|`|jLL7sDILaa	It is a pentacle, yes, but the pentacle has nothing to do with the Devil. It's a symbol of balance. The points represent the elements, and the top point represents Spirit. It's a pagan symbol.<br>  <br>  If it makes you uncomfortable, tell your boyfriend. He may have simply gotten it because he thinks it looks pretty and not know the symbolism.|`|dFBccLExaa	Oh that is very pretty. <br>  Yes, it is a pentacle, but no, it doesn't mean you worship the devil. <br>  If you want a Christian slant, you could say it's the 5 points of Jesus (I've heard this somewhere...) I guess they represent his head, hands and feet. But to a pagan, a pentacle is a symbol of protection, feminity, and the earth. It is a good sign, and we wear it proudly. <br>  Or, if you want to get them off your back, you could just say you like the design, but really, it is a beautiful pendant, and it would be a shame to have to stop wearing it because of them.|`|a86de0fc85e991d8d111b09367571df7aa	Ugg it's a nice trinket, and no it doesn't.<br>  <br>  If that symbol were reversed, with the two point sticking out the upper sides, THEN it would be a devil woshiping thingy (horns to the devil yatta yatta)<br>  The ones who tell you it's with the devil are ignorant and shouldnt be speaking.<br>  <br>  THAT sign is simply a pagan sign, of course to some Christians that's the same thing.|`|xzL2oRq9aa	It is a Pentacle. BUT! it does NOT mean you worship the "devil" <br>  <br>  I am a practicing Witch for six years, and i am Wiccan. <br>  <br>  The Pentacle is probably the most common symbol that is associated with Witchcraft, although many don't know its True meaning.<br>  <br>  When a Witch wears the Pentacle (a pentagram with a circle around it) it is a symbol of protecting. Not evil. (Witches don't even believe in "demons" the "devil" or demonic beings)<br>  <br>  A Pentagram (just the five-pointed star with circle) represents the four elements Earth, Air, Fire & Water, and then at the top point, it is traditionally taught as being Spirit, or Akasha, or Ether. The Witches Pentacle is with one point at the top, like yours, this is a sign of spiritual and physical protection.<br>  <br>  Now, when you take the Pentacle and invert it, with the two points up, then you generally see the symbol of a goat. This is thought to be the Animal of the "devil" and it is traditionally their sacred animal and sign.<br>  <br>  True Witches and Wiccans, don't practice black magick.<br>  <br>  First of all, Magick its self is neither black of white, it nature. It depends on the heart of the Witch, whether the maigck is used for positive or negative needs. <br>  <br>  If someone claims to be a Witch, and uses the sacred art for negative, then that person (a Witch can be male or female) is not a Witch. <br>  <br>  Because, generally Witches and especially Wiccans, follow the Wiccan Rede, which is kinda like a Golden Rule. <br>  <br>  "An Eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill: <br>   An ye harm none, do wat ye will"  <br>  <br>  That is short verison of the long sacred text. <br>  <br>  if you have more questions please ask me if you wish. <br>  <br>  But, i will say this, if you feel that the necklace doesn't go with your belifes, by all means take it off. Wiccans do not try to covert anyone who does not want to learn of the Craft of the Wise. <br>  <br>  )0( Blessed Be )0(<br>  <br>  Take Care, <br>  <br>  Nameste, <br>  <br>  Gabe|`|HrsPCzaBaa	That star is a pentagram. <br>  It has many religious symbolisms in religions such as: Christianity, Mormonism, Judaism, Neopaganism, Satanism, Taoism, Thelema,  and The Bahá'í Faith.<br>  <br>  It appears on two National flags that of Ethiopia, and Morrocco.|`|NxL4C1DMaa	Yes, this is a pentacle...No it doesn't mean devil worship. It's a representation of the 4 elements (earth, air, fire, water) and the Spirit or God. Remember that when the church was still young, they used it to represent the 5 wounds of Christ, among some other symbolism.|`|AA10430184	Yes, it's a pentacle.<br>  No, it has nothing to do with Satanism.<br>  The five points of the pentacle represent Earth, Air, Fire, Water and Spirit and is a symbol used by Pagans and Wiccans.<br>  I'm assuming that your boyfriend just thought it was pretty and didn't know what it was.|`|bcO9G7C8aa	yes it is a pentacle. No it does not mean that you worship the devil. The first tip means spirit, the right tip means air, the lower right tip means fire, the lower left tip means earth, and the last tip means water. So it does not have anything bad.|`|AA11605393	he bought it at hot topic and was just being nice. if you are christian a pentacle necklace isnt going to hurt anyone :) enjoy it--he was being sweet|`|hAFDi7qBaa	Couple of answers here-<br>  1st answer, yes that is a pentacle.<br>  2nd answer, no that isn't a devil worship pentacle.  The devil worship (Satanic) pentacle is inverted (upside down)<br>  3rd answer, What is a pentacle? A pentacle is a symbol most commonly associated with Wicca.Some Wiccans interpret the five points as representing earth, air, fire, water, and spirit -- the five factors needed to sustain human life. Others relate the points to the four directions and spirit.  Some Wiccans and other Neopagans bless themselves and others with the sign of the pentagram.<br>  <br>  So that's just a couple of thoughts.  Now then, him giving it to you at church?  That's a little odd in my thoughts, Is he considering a religious change to wicca?  Are you?  There are a lot of things you and him should look at if you are.  There are so many websites about wicca and what it is (and isn't) but I would say, if you are truly interested...go to a wicca shop and talk with one of the people there to get more ideas about it.  <br>  <br>  Btw, nice necklace.  It does look good on you.   :o)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|nTDlqdHIaa	From what I have just read a pentacle is worn by someone who is into Wicca which is witch craft. I have gathered you 2 websites one about the pentacle and one about Wicca...it says that Wicca worships the horned God which to my knowledge would be the devil but that's just what I gathered from it but I did not read all of it so read about it and figure it out for yourself. Honestly to me the necklace just looks like a decorated star with a red jewl in the middle of it and looks like something I would probably wear as well but I had never heard of a pentacle before this so I guess I will have to be more careful the next time I pick out a starred necklace huh? You learn something new everyday...hope the websites help =)|`|hzMpdFFBaa	Perhaps you should ask him why he gave it to you and what his beliefs are.  <br>  <br>  A pentacle is not a symbol of Satanism (unless inverted --and that was a  fairly recent invention). Nowadays, it is a symbol used by Wiccans--and your necklace looks like a Wiccan medallion. It is an archetypal geometric form that symbolizes earth, the directions of space, Nature, the senses/elements (earth, water, fire, air, essence), the human being, and also is a symbol of balance and perfection (the Pythagorean Golden Mean is base on the number 5). At a certain point in history, it symbolized the 5 wounds of Christ and the Star of Bethlehem.  It also is a magical symbol for the Hindu god Shiva.|`|MYO2k9EUaa	That's a really pretty necklace! I can't say its a pentacle because I'm not sure, but it looks sort of Egyptian and pagan-like. <br>  <br>  As for the devil stuff, that is nonsense. The devil's symbols look a lot different from your necklace.|`|a3e29a330d3667c5a647cd717385b3b7aa	Yes it is a pentacle, and no it does not mean you worship the devil.  It's a pagan symbol of unity.  Maybe he didn't know what it is, maybe he's trying to tell you something... I would talk to him and ask why he gave it to you...|`|2Lf3ayxKaa	If it were upside down then it would imply devil worship to some.

It is often worn around the neck, or placed within the triangle of evocation. Protective symbols may also be included (sometimes on the reverse), a common one being the five-point form of the Seal of Solomon, called a pentacle of Solomon or pentangle of Solomon.[2] Many varieties of pentacle can be found in the grimoires of Solomonic magic; they are also used in some neopagan magical traditions, such as Wicca, alongside other magical tools.<br>  <br>  The relationship between the words pentacle and pentagram (a five-point unicursal star) is unclear. The Oxford English Dictionary (Second Edition) treats the two as apparently synonymous, but notes that the actual history of pentacle is obscure. In an extended use, many magical authors treat them as distinct. In many tarot decks and in some forms of modern witchcraft, pentacles often prominently incorporate a pentagram in their design.|`|EZxI4w9Caa	not exactly it's a pentagram.<br>  <br>  but contrary to popular beliefs about PENTACLES they do NOT mean that you worship satan or anything.  Actually, some of them were known through out history to ward off demons/satan and used as protection.  Most Pentacles have Protection symbols of some kind drawn on them, usually on the back. although some of them really are satanic, most are not.  Most are used in wiccan beliefs etc.  (sort of similar to the pentagram.)<br>  <br>  as for your boyfriend, he might either have not known what it was, thought it was pretty and gave it to you.  had the wrong idea of what it was and wants to convert you to believe bs.  or he might know what it really is and just wanted to give it to you.<br>  <br>  in any sense talk to him about it because he might be straying a little from the right side of the tracks. lol.  <br>  <br>  be safe<br>  <br>  -alice|`|uaAVh0bXaa	It does have a pentagram(or pentacle) in it but isn't you're average pentagram which looks like this:<br>  <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/pentagram/baby_bangle/Proud%20To%20Be%20Wiccan/9132.gif?o=36" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/penta...</a><br>  <br>  To answer you're question no it doesn't mean you worship satan though some Christians believe this but they are sadly misinformed. Christians once upon a time used this symbol because they thought it symbolized the five wounds of Christ.<br>  Wiccans & Pagans also use this symbol & no they don't worship the devil. The pentagrams different points represent fire,earth,water,air & spiriit. If you feel uncomfortable wearing it then just tell you're boyfriend this,I'm sure he will understand.

Rather they have changed Islam from it's original perfected form and thusly, innovated a way of life that leads to Hellfire. This is not a dispute between a trivial "this" and "that", it is a serious issue dealing with the difference between the Straight Path to Paradise and the crooked paths that lead to punishment in this life and the next. May Allaah rectify our condition and affairs.<br>  <br>  With regards to Shee'ism, then it is not the Islam that was taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Rather, they are a group that have exaggerated the status of the noble family of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to the extent that they build shrines devoted to their worship along with Allaah. This is shirk, polytheism, the greatest crime a human being can commit in the sight of Allaah.<br>  <br>  The proper way to practice Islam is to follow the understanding of the Qur'aan and the Prophetic life example that was actually taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and actually lived by the Prophet, peace be upon him, his family, and his companions.<br>  <br>  All beliefs and acts of worship that oppose this way are affairs that lead away from Paradise and lead towards Hellfire.<br>  <br>  It is not permissible to worship Allaah with acts of worship that did not exist in the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him (such as pilgrimage to Karbala, calling upon 'Ali or other human beings for help who are dead or absent, building shrines dedicated to saints, etc...) And it is not permissible to interpret the Qur'aan with meanings that oppose what the Prophet, peace be upon him, actually taught.<br>  <br>  For more information about learning the basics of Islam, I recommend:<br>  <a href="http://www.islaam.ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.islaam.ca</a><br>  <a href="http://www.understand-islam.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.understand-islam.net</a>|`|913bbae2624c089784bbef5c666605e9aa	no if anything its like when Catholicism split in to eastern Orthodox and roman catholic|`|83evCnFHaa	like protestants and catholics in the gd old days|`|4ViYw6Hxaa	Brother<br>  <br>  <br>  It is more than this.<br>  <br>  Islam is TRUTH<br>  We have Holy Quran<br>  <br>  Inshallah one day we will unite on QURAN.<br>  <br>  Salafis rulers paid money to write Hadiths against Islam.<br>  BUT OUR QURAN IS TRUTH AND PROTECTED BY ALLAH.<br>  Inshallah we will unite on Quran.

If you are overly sensitive it's an absolute not a good thing. By you not being able to stand up to your step dad it shows that your not being sensitive...but you have lack of self esteem. If you are unable to stand up to your parents that's one thing. But you need to realize that when applying for a job, the bosses are looking for someone who they feel can get the job done. How do you present yourself while during an interview? Do you look them in the eyes while you speak, do you have your body in a relaxed state in the chair yet assertive. Do you answer their questions in a mousy way or do you speak authoritatively? What it sounds like you need to do is to work on your esteem issues. If your scared to speak to your parents that's one thing. But when you are away from them you need to be the best you can be. There's plenty of on line resources for you to study up on and practice. You need to wrtie down..what you like about yourself...what you don't...what you are willing to change...what will you do to make the change happen...You can start with you outside of the home. One day your parents will see the new confident you and have more respect for you. They are showing and teaching you to be sensitive and crybaby. You need to realize that they are not going to be there taking care of you forever. Don't forget...since your scared of your dad.....stay out of a relationship with a guy til you find yourself. If you don't, you will end up with a younger version of your step dad....Good Luck|`|oBXiigEoaa	You eventually just have to stand up for yourself.

You are experiencing the pain. This question can't be easily answered. The question is why you are afraid to speak up to him.<br>  <br>  Is he abusive? Does he ignore you? Depending on why may help you face up to him. As an example, if he is abusive, it might not be a good idea to stand up to him until you have some support.<br>  <br>  In general, there are two ways people stop being sensitive. The one is that they get hurt enough that they become calloused and just don't care. I hope that you won't take that route.<br>  <br>  The other way is that they learn techniques to develop their confidence. The martial arts are an excellent tool for this. You learn discipline and self confidence and begin to handle yourselves better.<br>  <br>  There are also programs at many schools that help people develop confidence and find ways to effectively confront and work things through with others.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that you talk to your parents, if possible, and see if a martial art is an option. If not, visit with your pastor or school counselor to see what help is available.<br>  <br>  Remember that God loves you. I'll be praying for you.<br>  <br>  Pastor John|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	Love Star, You need to stop obsessing over being sensitive, What do you want to be a hard cold hearted witch ? What guy will want you then ? Not a nice one, I can tell you that. I told you several times already, Focus on God and the rest will fall into place, Stop looking at everyone and everything around you, And look at Jesus and don't take your eyes off him , Read you bible, Pray, Go to Church, Fellowship with other Christians and leave the rest to God, Also, Tell God how you feel, There's' nothing wrong with expressing your concerns with God the way you are here with us , Also, As I have told you in the past, Just because you are the way you are Doesn't mean this his how you will always be, God is control of your life, And has you exactly where he wants you in life at this point, When he is ready to move you in a new direction, He will do so, So stop worrying and start trusting in God for the outcome of your life .

69MIm6bEaa	One general rule of thumb is to ask yourself if you would act differently if somebody of authority is watching you. Do you immediately stop what you are doing if a police officer walks by? Why do you stop? If you do not feel like you should act in that manner with a police officer or so around, then you probably shouldn't be acting that way at all. <br>  <br>  There are many different people in public places from children to adults. Think about what you were allowed to say when you were younger. If you were like me, even something seemingly harmless as the word "poop" was considered a "bad word" at a young age. This being said, cursing is definitely something that should be avoided at all costs, and your conversations should remain appropriate. As a general rule of thumb, keep conversations with words or content you were not allowed to use as a child out of public areas. Chances are, there are other parents who would prefer if they didn't have to deal with their children repeating what you say.<br>  <br>  Another thing you may want to try is acting as if your employer or potential employer is in the store. The last thing you want is to go in for a job interview where the human resources manager there knows you from your behavior in another store. Something like that can cost you a job, and it's hard enough to find a job in this economy.<br>  <br>  Learn to keep your opinions to yourself. In general, you should avoid commenting on somebody's appearance. If it's not something you would be willing to say directly to their faces (such as asking someone where they bought a top you like), then you probably shouldn't say anything at all. It's the basic rule "if you can't say anything nice, then don't say anything at all." This also goes for commenting on general beliefs, such as politics, religion, and controversial topics. Keep your comments positive. It's perfectly alright to discuss how you prefer one political party over another, but understand that not everybody will agree. Go ahead and say that you aren't pleased with what Obama has done so far, and you can talk about how you think John McCain would have been a better choice, but don't say anything that degrades Obama. Making faces, sound effects, or making comments that can be considered offensive (such as the controversial "monkey" topic when it comes to Obama) is probably not the wisest decision. <br>  <br>  Respect the property around you. It's alright to look at books, but don't just take out piles and piles of books. If you take out a book and decide it's not the right one, put it right back. Throw away your trash, try to wipe the crumbs off the table after you are done eating, and make sure you don't leave any mess behind.<br>  <br>  Remember basic manners. Say "please," "thank you," and "excuse me." Try not to get agitated over small inconveniences, or complain about everything that goes on. Don't sweat the small stuff. It's going to make you look less mature, and staying less stressed will also help improve your complexion and such. <br>  <br>  Obviously, follow the golden rule. Remember that you don't want to attract negative attention towards yourself. You want people to look at you and comment on your behavior in a positive way. The last thing you want to do is support negative stereotypes towards teenagers. <br>  <br>  Above all, keep having fun, but learn to tone it down. There are plenty of places you can go and act like complete fools. Just learn to keep the goofiness in those places.<br>  <br>  And even though you don't have to, you may want to consider practicing humility by approaching the management and/or employees of those places you've been disruptive in to apologize. Whether you've gotten in trouble or not, it will show that you do know how to behave. Just be sure to follow up with your apology by being on your best behavior. There's nothing worse than apologizing and then acting up again right after.|`|7oCpSkmxaa	When a kid learns to ride a bike, they have training wheels.  When they get used to riding, the training wheels can come off.<br>  <br>  You want to be treated like an adult, respected and taken seriously?  Take a look around you, find an adult who is respected by others, and who has qualities that you admire.  Try to spend time with that person, and pattern your behavior after them.  This is your "training wheels."  <br>  <br>  I'm not trying to tell you to get rid of your personality and try to be something you're not.  You'll get used to "feeling" how an adult acts, and you will notice people treating you differently.  Then you'll start being able to discern when it's OK to be a goofball and when you should lay low.  The key is balance - and that's not something anyone can give you rules for - you have to feel it out for yourself.<br>  <br>  PS I think the comments you made in your question show a great deal of maturity, and I commend you for that.  I definitely think your mindset is on the right track.|`|NCvX4I0baa	Well in general I guess be respectful of other people's spaces and don't be so loud.

QOxtCMEAaa	It's very simple. Normal people of any age don't even have to ask what to do or what it is. Just act neutral in public, or simple, behaved and just doing your errands or whatever you need to do while you're out.  This is the common and natural way that almost everyone acts in public and what we have in common with each other. The world is not our oyster, and the whole world is not our living room or bedroom.  If you are with someone out in public and are communicating with them, just talk. There's no need to do more than that. Just use your mouth, words, natural speaking voice volume and your simple expressions.

You're not disturbing anyone, those old cooks all know you are teenagers and they were like that at one time to. Just have fun while you're young and you'll become an adult when the time comes :P<br>  <br>  Just be polite to your elders and adults. Don't scream or sing obnoxiously and try not to laugh really loud no matter how much fun you're having with your friends.<br>  You can be yourself in other loud places like the mall or something if you don't want a lot of people to hear you :P
04f345ca740404026090acf2b474e49caa	I think Israel is a great cause for America but not for the church.  I love the Jews with all my heart but church money should be kept separate from matters of state.  Church money needs to go to preaching and teaching the Gospel.  It should never be funneled into govt's.|`|VzIWDuRzaa	No, but I donate to America to fight terrorism.|`|jOPUBmlJaa	I wish the fighting would stop, it is needless, blame only worsens the situation.|`|e566c7b6d9b860034b1ffaf13f380ee7aa	My church does not.|`|cic4J2hzaa	not sure|`|fEkKuGlEaa	No, never. How do they even do that--wouldn't they have to give money straight to the Israeli government? <br>  <br>  My church gives to medical missions and children's homes around the world. If there were a way to give to the medical needs of people hurt on both sides of the conflict, we might do that.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Yes, to the Jerusalem Prayer Team and others---don't have a list here but they donate to over 200 ministries and Mike Evans (from JPT) came to our church to speak.|`|i7oHTo9haa	Hi I am not Christian just wanted to thank people that help and to say hey to responder Matt D:<br>  <br>  I am Jewish American... do you know what President said this about government?<br>  <br>  "that this nation, under G-d, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."<br>  <br>  I just wanted to interject that a government IS the people. Lincoln in his Gettysburg Address thought so too and so did our forefathers. If one doesn't support gov't at all then one doesn't support the people at all. Israel is same way as we are a Jewish "nation."  Perhaps there is just one particular thing you don't support or is it an all or nothing deal.<br>  <br>  Do what you want though!  Thanks everyone else you're in my thoughts and prayers and actions too so we can support each other!|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	No.<br>  <br>  I am for Israel defending herself, but some of the tactics she uses is against the morals of our faith.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	No, I would never go to a Church that financed war.|`|dbw210qqaa	CUFI does
urbo9yUqaa	Wearing rainbow does not make you a lesbian, touching other girls does not make you a lesbian, hanging aroudn other LGBT does not make you a lesbian, and not talking about guys at all does not make you a lesbian. <br>  <br>  It just sounds like she's a very nice, accepting, kind, and outgoing person that comfortable in her skin. She might be a lesbian but she'll tell you if she wants to. Don't try to squeeze it out of her and continue to be her good friend :)|`|BpE2eHS5aa	just ask her. [like it really matterz]<br>  it shouldn't be that awkward since shes obviously not a homphobe.|`|Vu726Q18aa	Ask her and i hope you know the joe bros are gay|`|7xGtL1vxaa	The best way to find out is to ask her. If she is your true friend, then you should be able to ask her this question and get an honest answer from her. Does it bother you that she may be gay or are you scared of the fact that she is?  I'm only asking because you said "What do I do"? Just ask her.|`|DZFoyOvyaa	there is nothing you can do it is HER choice respect that.<br>  are you homophobic?<br>  <br>  edit: just ask her and if she is reasure her your still her friend no matter what|`|ocy7FEcaaa	Why do you have to do anything?

It is wicked and cruel to pillory, or judge, and if done in a condescending manner it brings even more subjugation! Personally I would stay away but that is only because I find this sort of behavior deeply offensive! It harms the fabric of a human beings personality and it is catching! If she is a friend then by example YOU can lead, then she has the choice to follow or not! Put your hand in the fire and you'll get burned-that IS a Promise! Rainbows are nice, but you can't touch them!|`|GUdGJaYsaa	****** REBECCA IS LESBO OK?!!??!?!?!|`|baWu2u5zaa	You pull her off to the side, sit her down, and ask her if she is a lesbian.

I mean she's showing the natural signs of a lesbian already, but if she wears baggy or super tight clothes, tenis shoes, really short hair, gives interested looks to girls, ignores boys, talks about her boobs all the time, wears low cut shirts, wears low pants, compliments people on their looks, gets complimented on her looks, or if her name has less than 5 letters in it... well then you're out of luck. Because she's a lesbian.
q5lreoiWaa	Act your age and not your shoe size.|`|AA12152549	My dear, there is far too much drama going on here; so let's cut to the chase.  It would be OK to tell your bf that you and your cousin had dinner together and that you had been given the b-day gift.  You don't know that your bf is actually going to be jealous, so don't second-guess him.  You also might consider the advisability of having a jealous bf in the first place.  Jealousy is generally not a good thing.|`|Ne7xr36Saa	I think "bored in KDH" said it exactly as I was going to....  I would read his again if I were you.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	You may be 25, but you are acting more like a 13 year old.  I suggest you grow up, stop thinking about making the supposed BF jealous and get on with your life.  At 25, you really should know that a b-day is just another day, and you must know that you are playing silly childish games.  Good luck to you, I hope this helps.|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	So he has a convenient reason not to hang out with you or give you even a token present on Valentine's Day and your birthday, but he's jealous of your relatives showing that they care about you? And he's borrowing your money? What a creep.<br>  Thank you for telling your age, because all this drama does make you sound like you're about 13, like someone said above. Don't lie to him about where you were and with whom. If he's mad that your cousin (it's your cousin, for God's sake! Does he think you're going to date your cousin?!) was there for you when he wasn't, then tell him to give back your $100.00 and kick rocks.|`|O4jGlC2caa	Just tell him you didn't hear the phone.  Regardless of whether or not I had surgery on my tooth, I would still at least try to give my significant other a nice time for their birthday... even if that meant drooling and groaning into a bowl of soup at the table while they opened up a gift and ate some cake.<br>  <br>  The guy sounds like a bum.  Of course he didn't get you anything for V-day.  He can't even pay his own bills and need his girlfriend to help.<br>  <br>  You need to rethink this relationship.  Is he worth it?|`|giBfNMX6aa	It depends - obviously if you tell him, he will most likely be angry.  Maybe you're ready for the relationship to be over.  I'd be pretty ticked off if he borrowed $ for a bill but never planned to do anything with me on my birthday.|`|ZzcGlrtCaa	Don't be mad at him for not calling on V-Day until after you called first. You said you would call him some other time. If you loaned out money for him to pay a bill, how would you expect him to have money to buy you a gift? <br>   Now for your defense. Tell him the truth about the Teddy Bear and candy. You're both adults. Is this cousin 1st or 2nd? If he gets jealous over a relative you might want to look deeper into what you can't see. His respect and trust in you.
de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	I'm sure you can find other friends who are funny and fun to hang out with sans the bad attitude and the bitchiness. Your friend is lacking in self esteem, she is jealous of any attention being paid to anyone other than her and she will only get worse in time...you can try telling her ONE time how her comments affect you, but I can tell you now, ain't nothin' gonna change. YOU have to effect change by finding better friends and stop wasting time on this dysfunctional bratty immature girl.|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	Find some other friends|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	I bet you could find some fun, funny friends who don't have to put their friends down to feel better about themselves.<br>  Tell her that her comments are a thinly-veiled cry for help, and she can either stop them and admit that she has a problem, or she can get out of your life.|`|qmLjEXlDaa	I would call her on it.  I would have asked her what made her think of Amy Adams?  Is it because of the woman in Wall-mart.  People who make  passive aggressive comments are usually week and look for a way out of being confronted.  I would not hang around her.|`|uQSgesJ8aa	she insulted you. if she isn't going to be receptive to your comment on that, then what does that say? nice people are more fun than funny, insecure girls.|`|tBwdVpG4aa	Next time she says something like that, tell her not to be such a b!|`|7EcoKxhlaa	I always say "Kindness is the finest" then walk away and pray.. and if that doesn't work I find kinder friends.

f3e3b0693aa8b88334778da96a51e04baa	Well, to be fair I have to preface this. I object to voting and do not vote, because I don't really think we end up with choices. The Democratic and Republican Parties are the ones that really pick for us. I have heard all the counter arguments: that I have no right to complain if I don't vote, etc.... I am voting by not voting. It's  called a boycott....<br>  <br>  Therefore, I am actually non partisan and perhaps one of the few in the US who can claim to be, because I didn't vote for anyone.<br>  <br>  I think the Media seems largely biased in favor of President Obama. <br>  Objectively speaking, he has made numerous appointment post mistakes including three cabinet appointees that did not pay their own taxes. <br>  <br>  It seems every media report references the President's position on things that are not related to him. Every time there has been recent corruption anywhere in the Democratic party, the media seems too certain to point out that Obama would probably not approve of it. <br>  I'm not doubting that he wouldn't approve of it but why say it? It seems that there are numerous positive plugs for the man in places that I can't understand. <br>  <br>  Let me make myself clear, I don't think Obama is "bad" or has any kind of ties to lots of the corruption in politics. I think it's just weird that every time something comes out, there is a little plug for him peppered in there if the story has anything to do with Politics in any way. I can't remember that happening for another president.|`|7aK81hsbaa	depends on what the media portays- i like obama and voted for him.|`|urbo9yUqaa	I don't listen to the media.

That's way lame.  The fact that she consented to have unprotected sex has gotten her in a whole heap of $h!t.  She has to deal with this in an adult way now; and above all she must tell the truth no matter how difficult it is.  If she lies it will only catch up with her later on and cause a ton of trouble.

aLgLVOTFaa	I think you should tell her how you feel all from what you said above cause thats you and no one feels how you feel about her right? yea so if i were you i would tell her to her face and be so honest to her she diserves to know everything so tell her.Dont chicken out take the challenge ;) good luck|`|PNw70xuLaa	I think if you want a letter you should write it yourself! It would sound so much better coming from you. But I think you should talk to her face to face because if she doesn't like you there will be a lot of tension b/t you two once she reads it. I don't think you should tell her, yet, though, because it could ruin your friendship if she doesn't like you back. I think you should just keeping "fooling around" or whatever, and try to see how far you can go. Get a little more personal each time, and see when she tells you it's too far (don't overdo it though XD). It may sound kind of schemey but what else are you going to do?

R1FjOFkUaa	Ask your parents to put you in a public or private school. You'll make a ton of friends.|`|NeOVXJcXaa	I'm 15 and I've never had a friend. Don't have much interest in having one either, but fair-weather friends are fun. It can get a bit lonely, I admit.<br>  <br>  I used to have really bad social anxiety in middle school and then, well, I still had no friends at all.<br>  <br>  Before you can be friends with anyone else, you have to be friends with yourself. Be confident in everything you do and don't care about what people think of you--it's not worth it at all, TRUST me, I lived 14 years of my life based on what people wanted me to be and I was so miserable.<br>  <br>  If you show self-confidence and if you smile and act natural you'll look like an approachable person, and making friends then will be easy.|`|S2mTsV1vaa	Yeah. It's okay. I didn't get friends until Middle School. And you know what? Now my "friends" use me. They always go out without me. Never ask me to do anything. So friends aren't always friends.

You are being prevented from having friends -- that is a very different thing.<br>  <br>  I very much doubt that I pray to the same being that your family does, but I will pray to the goddess in her aspect as mother to abide with you anyway.

They're also different too in appearance, culture, beliefs, lifestyle... etc. Different causes quarrels and negative opinions, which is another root to racism.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	Unfortunately, there are some people in this world who make fun of others to make themselves feel better.

bndE2CXoaa	I read all previous answers before this one of mine. All of those have various mistakes.  Pay attention because the ones I'll give you are strictly correct, even if you find that at times exact literal translation is not possible or is not advisable.  But mine are all correct.  I know Spanish. . . and I manage myself reasonably in English.<br>  <br>  "I've heard lots about you" is:  He oido muchas cosas sobre ti. (Or "He oido mucho acerca de ti" would be just as good also).<br>  <br>  "I'm Nico's friend, too" is:  Yo tambien soy amiga de Nico.<br>  <br>  "I hope we can be friends" is:  Espero que seamos amigos.  (Or "Espero que podamos ser amigos" would be just as good).<br>  <br>  "My Spanish is not very good" is:  Me espaniol no es muy bueno.  (Or "no se espaniol muy bien" would be just as good).<br>  <br>  "Sorry" is:  Lo siento.  (Or you could also say "Me disculpas", or "Disculpame" or "Lo lamento" or "con tu perdon" or "me perdonas".  All of them mean more or less the same to say  you are sorry.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your Spanish language studies.

q9C46Wuqaa	1. - We all have two kidneys.<br>  <br>  - No, without kidneys your body will shut down. You can survive with one kidney.<br>  <br>  - Your kidneys are bean-shaped organs, each about the size of your fist. They are located near the middle of your back, just below the rib cage. The kidneys are sophisticated reprocessing machines. Every day, your kidneys process about 200 quarts of blood to sift out about 2 quarts of waste products and extra water. The waste and extra water become urine, which flows to your bladder through tubes called ureters. Your bladder stores urine until you go to the bathroom.<br>  The wastes in your blood come from the normal breakdown of active tissues and from the food you eat. Your body uses the food for energy and self-repair. After your body has taken what it needs from the food, waste is sent to the blood. If your kidneys did not remove these wastes, the wastes would build up in the blood and damage your body.<br>  The actual filtering occurs in tiny units inside your kidneys called nephrons. Every kidney has about a million nephrons. In the nephron, a glomerulus—which is a tiny blood vessel, or capillary—intertwines with a tiny urine-collecting tube called a tubule. A complicated chemical exchange takes place, as waste materials and water leave your blood and enter your urinary system.<br>  At first, the tubules receive a combination of waste materials and chemicals that your body can still use. Your kidneys measure out chemicals like sodium, phosphorus, and potassium and release them back to the blood to return to the body. In this way, your kidneys regulate the body’s level of these substances. The right balance is necessary for life, but excess levels can be harmful.<br>  <br>  2. And the compounds of a non metal are: Nonmetals have high ionization energies and electronegativities. They are generally poor conductors of heat and electricity. Solid nonmetals are generally brittle, with little or no metallic luster. Most nonmetals have the ability to gain electrons easily. Nonmetals display a wide range of chemical properties and reactivities. <br>  <br>  High ionization energies<br>  High electronegativities<br>  Poor thermal conductors<br>  Poor electrical conductors<br>  Brittle solids<br>  Little or no metallic luster<br>  Gain electrons easily<br>  <br>  3.

If she can't give you time and understand where you are coming from then you need to deal with that confliction first.<br>  <br>  What does it matter as long as you are together?|`|3cVPrwUVaa	I'm not gay so maybe my answer will be a bit different to a gay persons ..  if my hypothetical  sister introduced me to her hypothetical gay friend I would prefer it done with the gay friend present and not being pre warned of the situation prior to the introduction ..  just lay it on me and then I would be far more accepting of the woman involved and take her on her own terms without my imagination running away on me.|`|GRebsvfiaa	damn ur lesbian|`|FsozOO6Zaa	I understand why your girlfriend feels that way, but she shouldn't push or rush you in any way if you are not ready! Your parents should always love you and care for you, no matter what orientation you are. They have to accept the fact theat you are still their child...though my dad jokes about it and i always say hey what if so and so is whatever lol but we just laugh it off.. oh dad!|`|le29yexraa	Have you told her how worried you are?|`|TqQcB2gWaa	Tell them and hope for the best, can't go wrong being honest. Or else it will eat you up inside forever.|`|eGvyFeW9aa	She shouldn't be rushing you about it, but I guess you should just come right out and say it. You'll feel relieved.|`|lO5CCIB5aa	just tell them and tell them that if they dont agree with it then they dont f***ing love u|`|DZFoyOvyaa	tell them it is better that you tell them rather than finding out from somone else

Since in our age faith and Islam have been the objects of the attacks launched in the name of so called science and logic, Bediuzaman Said Nursi therefore concentrated in the Risale-i Nur on proving the truths of faith in conformity with modern science through rational proofs and evidence, and by decribing the miraculous aspects of the Quran that relate primarily to our century.|`|51892c12506b240500310aefa8daf61daa	Abul Haarith answers is the only one worth reading.<br>  <br>  Check out the scholar section on the left hand side.

fghgwE2waa	Hi. It's tradisional to me because we would sing it every Christmas and still do. The song is Holly Jolly Christmas. Peace|`|jc5yO2l2aa	The songs make it really seem like the holiday is here|`|087c14ef810cae54ec446439f9012410aa	because all songs were made for a purpose and the point is to listen to them and depending on what it says will be its purpose of the tradition and some have more uses than others. christmas makes more people eager and excited about that special time with the family and friends and loved ones.

b0c58cc0b655a543b52a5ab7c8f62835aa	Both are good, <br>  <br>  My impressions of the names:<br>  <br>  Tyler is more of a name of ordinariness on the low-side of the scale which I don't prefer.<br>  <br>  Christopher is a name which gives the impression of intelligence on the have way of the scale (normal) rather than high on the scale which I find to be good.|`|2MU7rRsuaa	Christopher|`|tG2YWQdDaa	Tyler ! :D|`|EycMZe4Uaa	Christopher Tyler ( last name )|`|UNKRsSrlaa	kyristopeheres!|`|3zMgs98caa	I like Tyler|`|D9k0aoqdaa	Tyler all the way, much more rocky.|`|q4pLY5F8aa	Christopher.|`|njrKjJVwaa	Christopher|`|Zadysvg5aa	Christopher,  by a long way.

MhfneF0xaa	I don't watch porn. It isn't worthy of my attention.<br>  <br>  It is depersonalizing and degrading.<br>  <br>  I suppose, on some level, stimulation is to some degree more effective on the visual level, since we are such visual creatures, But I find that porn cheapens and degrades sex.<br>  <br>  So, why not let him look at you up close? I mean, after all, you *are* married. At least, it would deflate his excuse.<br>  <br>  Is your weight gain one of the problems you are trying to work through? Sounds like it to me. Maybe you could explore this with the counselor.|`|6KsIsFbaaa	Men watch porn because it releases<br>  sexual tension<br>  You been feeling self conscious meaning your uncomfortable with your body right<br>  he Might feel Like he is in a sex-less realtionship<br>  most men do this by the way<br>  I say you try to be more comfortble with your body<br>  and have som sex occasionaly<br>  if you cant try that maybe<br>  do some 4 play or something sexually invovled you dont have to have sex join a class,<br>  <br>  maybe he is just really horny or a sex addict|`|aW5uShwtaa	Why do women read romance novels? For the same reason, sexual stimulation. Get over it. If you were a good wife you would buy him porn and watch it with him.|`|n55igpCUaa	He's satisfying his fantasies.

Your poem is good, but it would make it easier to follow in a sense if you stuck to one continuous rhyme scheme. Or, If you prefer you don't have to rhyme at all - you can just make a free verse poem, but otherwise, yes, your poem is very nice. <br>  <br>  ***Also - have you come up with a title for your poem? If so, it would be nice to know. :)|`|R1FjOFkUaa	It's great! =D|`|YlMR42agaa	Sweet :) I love it yo!|`|ZMQLV1t4aa	i really like it =)
OuCUBiF3aa	yes.. cause when the catch one it will fall like a domino effect and they'll have all. n u probably wont b able 2 graduate|`|ahfzZ665aa	Is this some sort of protest? I gues it depends, nothing if you dont get caught. It depends on how much weed you have on you anfd the laws in your state. Dont think for one second thos "freinds" wont rat you out and tell the cops who gave them the weed. You will probably get charged depending on the amount of weed you had in total, or you might just get a warning. I think you will all probably get suspended, and the school will call your parents. You might get expelled who knows! I woudlnt do it, unless you can do it where you know you wont get caught!|`|VcrDOsFKaa	man....u r in boiling hot water.....|`|BgRGlU9jaa	Yes, but not as much trouble as if you got caught alone.<br>  They will probably call your parents and you may get in trouble<br>  for doing it on school property.

gipfVShsaa	It is socially acceptable. It is here anyway. Just not "legally acceptable". <br>  <br>  I think it should be legalized and taxed. We have the rights to do with our bodies what we want. The government has no right at ALL to put us in prison for a vitcimless crime. And putting people in prison for a "crime" like that wastes tax dollars and violates our freedom.

I agree with other posters, don't worry about tongue action just yet.|`|jAZ8UruEaa	randomly go for it. you'll know when the opportunity presents itself. just go slow and don't use you're tongue at first until you figure out what his mouth feels like. don't use too much spit. be soft, not hard. it's not urgent, so don't attack him.|`|n6EEvyh7aa	Ask Sarah Michelle Gellar to help you.
grXlq18Caa	Now I cant really tell you what to do because I dont know your mom. I know when I came out it was totally cool because my sister was already openly gay, so i just blurted it out after my sister and her girlfriend yelled at me. She was like "really? Do you think thats the root of your stress?" We talked for like 5 minutes, my sisters girlfriend stated hitting on me as a joke, then we made dinner.<br>  <br>  If your mom really loves you she will accept you. If she hasnt had much exposure to gay people then DONT blurt it out like I did. It may cause her to overreact unintentionaly, she may not be thinking when she gives her opinion. <br>  <br>  Good luck with telling your mom and the wedding.

Just introduce your girlfriend to your mother as your girlfriend. Let your mom do the rest. There is nothing wrong with you or your bisexuality.

Last December I visited for the first time in about 6 years.  It was great to see my family and old, familiar places.  Oh, and the food was great!<br>  <br>  But I was also sad.  My hometown is no longer the town that I grew up in.  At one time it was quaint, historic and very diverse.  Now it is violent, dangerous and filthy.  There is a major problem with illegals.  Even the legal businesses are mostly in Spanish and I haven't studied Spanish in many years.  I'm afraid for my aging father who has been broke into and has had things stolen from his yard.

Ojfw6HBZaa	Er, that's hard to say.<br>  <br>  For one, I'll assume you're a native English speaker. Russian is NOT in the same language family as English; English is a Germanic language. For an English speaker, Germanic languages are generally easier to learn. I myself have spoken English and German since a young age. I speak passable Japanese and found it fairly easy. Latin was moderately hard for me to learn; I could NOT for the life of me EVER grip French and gave up on it.<br>  <br>  For two, some people are very talented with languages and pick them up easier than others. Some people struggle.<br>  <br>  For three, how much time are you realistically planning on putting into this? Learning a language can be a full time thing. You also have to keep in mind that while tutorials and books are nice, they realistically don't teach you how to speak like a normal person; you must find people to converse with. Idioms, slang, and the like are generally not taught in books or classes and it makes it very easy to sound like a robot, have trouble understanding casual speakers, or even makes it easy to become offensive in some situations.<br>  <br>  For four, Russian does not use the Roman alphabet; it is written in Cyrillic. You must learn a whole new reading and writing system on top of the language as well. This is the same sort of reason many English speakers find, say, Japanese hard to learn.<br>  <br>  Do you have any previous foreign language learning experience? Are you willing to put in a heavy effort?<br>  <br>  It all depends on the person, the effort, and the resources.|`|uUvpvoNraa	Russian can be quite difficult, but only if your not used to dealing with six grammatical cases which you use in noun and adjective inflections. It is also very necessary to master the Cyrillic Russian Alphabet and be able to read it fluenty, because Russian also has a lot of rules with vowel harmony and other consonant changes.<br>  <br>  Here is a tip. Get used to the grammar first before learning the language. You would find that you will struggle less.

XEbrGfZuaa	The year, was 1958. Which was a great year for new cars as well.<br>  It was in February of my sophomore year, when I met my first boyfriend (and floated on cloud nine for almost two years that followed). It was at a military academy dance, so I felt like I was Cinderella at the ball, and he was Prince Charming. It was like love at first sight, and my attraction was returned, and it was a glorious feeling to experience. I finally knew what it was, to feel loved, and it overwhelmed me, to the point, that later I cried and laughed uncontrollably with happiness. They say, no one ever forgets their first<br>  love.

Only animals such as snails and worms can be hermaphrodites. Humans are NOT born with both sets of sex organs, that is a common MYTH. There are people who are born some mixture of male and female tissues though and they are more correctly identified as "Intersex(ed)". There are dozens of intersex conditions. They range from not visible to ambiguous. For example a woman with AIS (androgen insensitivity syndrome) looks completely female. Her AIS may not be discovered until puberty when she fails to menstruate. The reason is she has no female organs (uterus and ovaries) is because she is chromosomally XY. However, her body is insensitive to the effects of testosterone (hence the name AIS) and the estrogen in her body makes her develop that way. It should be noted that everyone has both estrogen and testosterone in their bodies.<br>  <br>  Another important thing to keep in mind is although their bodies may be intersexed these people are NOT a third gender. The vast majority, like everyone else, have firm gender identities. Meaning they have a strong sense of themselves as males or females.

zQyslfHKaa	Christian 'science' strikes again...<br>  <br>  There is no Evil, darkness is not evil, its simply the absense of light.  Gambling and drinking can be abused but are also greatly entertaining to people.<br>  <br>  Energy is required for both drinking and gambling.|`|dKgkHZf3aa	Evil is only natural if you don't believe there is a Creator.  Did God create things to be evil or did He create them to be good?  If He created things to be good then it is unnatural for them to be evil.  When considering light and darkness, neither of them are bad because they stick to the roles God gave to them when He formed them.  Light is meant to dispel darkness and darkness can never overcome it.  Sounds natural to me.|`|u33x2hqzaa	Really interesting question.  Maybe we're here to expend energy and not to waste it by not using it?  Maybe we can only make progress, be it worldly, emotional or spiritual by expending energy, and working on ourselves?  The problem with letting darkness reign is that is kills our happiness, our spirit, our joy like a crack head who is addicted, has no self-respect and will sleep any person just to get a fix.  What started out as fun, even exhilirating becomes a ball & a chain to which our spirit is affixed. Therein lies the rub.  Even doing nothing or chasing after pleasure comes at a price and one that may literally kill us and leave no mark upon this earth and us none the wiser for it.  Ask yourself, is this how you want your life to pass?  If not, then use your energy to chase after what you believe to be the highest and the best.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	Black holes have and give off energy.

Usually, I'd say, "no, don't mess up the friendship", but it sounds like this moved beyond friendship awhile ago.

You should only enter into this if you want a deeper relationship.

RrgmHGNMaa	Latin is useful to help learning almost all European languages, as they have something of it; moreover Latin is supposed to be a "rationalist" language, but so difficult due to declination and conjugation (which many other languages have too, such as German, Dutch, Slavic ones etc.). Now, Cyrillic alphabet is a mixture of Greek and Latin ones, with a few special letters or symbols with Slavic origin. (Polish, Russian, Czech, Bosnian and all Slavic languages are too complex - in my opinion -, moreover those which use Cyrillic alphabets, each one having "just a little bit more of particularities", ah ha ha ha!... I find Russian perhaps the most or at least one of the most beautiful languages to be listened to, due to their intonation and palatal sounds; however... it′s too difficult, due to alphabet, declinations, conjugations  and other hard things - I don′t intend to learn such things anymore!!!).<br>  <br>  Greetings from Brazil, South America!|`|nnBAnBOlaa	It will help in that you are used to dealing with grammar, idioms, and forms of speech different from English.<br>  <br>  Polish is a Slavic and not a Romance language.  It does not have as many similarities to Latin as Spanish or Portuguese.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Polish is not a romance language.  Learning Latin can help you with French, Spanish, Italian, Romanian.  Polish is a Slavic language, though it uses the Roman alphabet (with diacritical marks).  <br>  <br>  So knowing the Roman alphabet will make Polish much easier to read. But you already knew the alphabet. 8^)|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Latin can help a bit, but knowing Russian or Ukrainian would be more help in learning Polish, at least as far as vocabulary and grammar.<br>  <br>  Latin grammar rules can help with Polish, because it also uses a case system like Latin. But as someone else already mentioned, Polish is written in the Latin alphabet, with a lot of diacritics (accent marks) to distinguish sounds.<br>  <br>  It's a challenging language, but a truly fascinating one.<br>  Powodzenia!

I3rjYVUFaa	Divine Inspiration. The Bible describes many scientific facts which man did not "discover" until hundreds or thousands of years AFTER they were written in the Bible:<br>  <br>  1) The spherical shape of the earth(Job 26:10, Isaiah 40:22) <br>  2) The earth is suspended in nothing (Job. 26:7). <br>  3) The stars are innumerable (Gen. 15:5). <br>  4) The existence of valleys in the seas (2 Sam. 22:16). <br>  5) The existence of springs and fountains in the sea (Gen.7:11; 8:2; Prov. 8:28). <br>  6) The existence of water paths(ocean currents) in the seas (Psalm 8:8). <br>  7) The water cycle (Job. 26:8; 36:27-28; 37:16; 38:25-27; Ps. 135:7; Ecc. 1:6-7). <br>  8) The fact that all living things reproduce after their own kind (Gen. 1:21; 6:19). <br>  9) The nature of health, sanitation, and sickness (Gen.17:9-14; Lev. 12-14). <br>  10) The concept of entropy, that energy is running down (Psalm 102:26).<br>  <br>  *Sigh*  You might also notice that this website: <a href="http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/febible.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/febible.ht...</a> DOES NOT comment on Job 26:10. Why? Here's why: <br>  <br>  Job 26:10  He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness. <br>  <br>  You can prove this to yourself with a flashlight and a softball in a dark room. Put the ball on the floor and spin it. Now shine the flashlight on it. No matter how you do this, the BOUNDARY of light and darkness is a CIRCLE. It doesn't take a rocket scientist or a Hebrew scholar to realize that the flashlight represents the sun and the softball is the earth.<br>  <br>  Now try to substitute ANY OTHER GEOMETRIC SHAPE for the softball, and keep the "boundary between light and darkness" a CIRCLE. Guess what? If you are smarter than a fifth grader, you can see that a frisbee won't work. The Bible states that the earth is SPHERICAL, you just have to read it. You must also realize that the earth is 2/3 water, so MOST of this LINE will be on the ocean.<br>  <br>  Here is the same scripture in several different versions:<br>  <br>  GNB (Good News Bible): Job 26:10  He divided light from darkness by a circle drawn on the face of the sea. <br>  <br>  LITV (LITERAL Translation): Job 26:10  He has described a circle on the surface of the waters to the boundary of light with darkness. <br>  <br>  MKJV (Modern King James): Job 26:10  He has described a circle on the surface of the waters to the boundary of light with darkness. <br>  <br>  ESV (English Standard): Job 26:10  He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness. <br>  <br>  And for those able to read, Hebrew Old Testament:<br>  <br>  (HOT): Job 26:10 ????? ?????????? ???????? ??? ????????|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Sigh. The bible refers to the earth as a CIRCLE. That is a flat shape. The bible is wrong about the shape of the earth. Here you go:<br>  <a href="http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/febible.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/febible.ht...</a><br>  <br>  And do you think all people thousands of years ago were retarded and couldn't notice some stuff makes it more likely that you get sick?|`|B7TFX4wUaa	No, they thought the world was a circle and they knew less about disease than Hippocrates.|`|6jAVElX7aa	Joshua 10 states that when Joshua went into battle to avenge himself on His enemies.

Joshua 10-14 Shows The Lords power doesnt it?|`|cNniG2L0aa	I have my doubts about that BUT nevertheless you shouldn't forget that the following glaring mistakes are also mentioned in bibel.<br>  <br>  Bats are not birds.<br>  Bats are NOT "fowl" … with 4 legs.<br>  Rabbits do not chew their own cud.<br>  Pi does not equal 3.<br>  The Earth is not a circle.<br>  Rabbits do not have hoofs.<br>  The cure for leprosy is not rubbing birds blood all over a person.<br>  The earth is not flat.<br>  Snakes can't talk.<br>  Donkeys can't talk.<br>  People can't float to the sky.<br>  <br>  All in all I'd suggest bibel is fairly unreliable to say the least, wouldn't you?<br>  ~|`|kL8BzsBNaa	The around the world part could have been interpreted another way though.

The Puritan settlers in New England first tried to treat the Native Americans fairly (in their own eyes), but once they learned that Native Americans were polygamous, went around mostly nude in good weather, and had other culturally shocking differences, the shock led to fear which led directly to war. It's true that some Europeans found the NA way of life superoir and went to go live with a tribe; these people were called renegades and were despised. Similarly with Africans. Africans came with a profoundly alien culture (ancestor worship, weird dances and incessant drumming, polygamy, strange hairstyles and so forth) that scared and repulsed Americans. The same thing happened with Chinese laborers brought over to help build the Transcontinental Railroad. They were despised because they had long hair, couldn't speak English (people love to hate people who  can't speak their own language - at least at home) and kept to themselves. Later the Chinese established opium dens and brothels in San Francisco and Seattle and the women's temperance movement (some of them feminists) went to war with these establishments, and even succeeded in passing national legislation strictly regulating the immigration of Asians. The Japanese already hated the Chinese, but when they came here they found Americans shocking. (In Japan, everyone's home is open to the stranger. He must ask to be admitted, of course, but it is very rude to refuse him shelter or food. Over here we triple lock our doors and answer the door with a gun in our hand.) So of course the Americans despised the Japanese on principle, and when Japan beat Russia in the 1904 war, Japan became a threat to American interests in Asia.<br>  The rest of it can be blamed upon simple arrogance and nastiness. There was no reason for the US soldiers in Vietnam to hate the Vietnamese, but they did (although quite a few did marry Vietnamese women). Racism is irrational, Jack. It doesn't need a reason to exist,<br>  just an excuse.|`|z64ofypJaa	Why would anyone be racist against anyone? Racism is complete idiocy bred by ignorance, self censorship, and most of all, fear.

5OucqEzFaa	Only the mercy of God can triumph over justice (James 2:13). Jesus reminded us that God desires mercy, not sacrifice (Matthew 12:7). Sadly, in this imperfect world, mercy is hard to come by.    Yet God, in his infinite wisdom and mercy requires only that we act justly and love mercy and walk humbly with God (Micah 6:8).    Take comfort from the knowledge that you are precious in God's eyes and that "in all things, God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?" Romans 8:18-38.    This too, will pass. Just lift your eyes to heaven and lay your burden at the foot of the cross.    Edit: Forgot to answer your question! The reason our judicial system(s) are not big on mercy is because they are man-made and therefore fatally flawed. Reminds me of Shylock in the Merchant of Venice - let's all have our pound of flesh and who cares about mercy (the quality of which should not be strained - even Shakespeare noted that back then). You may think you have nothing of value, but God values you and loves you with an everlasting love.|`|Shp5riE6aa	Where mercy is given, mercy is shown.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Yeah, they should be locked away somewhere...like....a prison....hmmmm.

Our system is more focused on punishment than correction, although most of our prisons are set up under a Department of Corrections.  If a judge is lenient on a child molester for instance, he is denounced.  People have an easier time forgiving a murderer than a molester.      A lawyer I know once told me that the law and court has nothing to dow ith justice. It's all about public opinion and how things are perceived.      On a side note, I don't think that we as a nation are capable of either dispensing true justice or even understanding it if we saw it.|`|QWUJiAxQaa	That's what prison is for.

0Vq79OwMaa	If we do as we should we will be sowing the Word of God and will reap the fruits of godly people.  We are reaping continually, either for God or for Satan.   Unfortunately the ruler of this world is powerful and his darts hit many of our people.   As a society in hole I believe most have dropped the ball and the results are apparent. God and His Holy Word is being pushed further and farther out. His truth is not being passed down by the parents.   The broken home is the first target, and as the children get their education from what ever they choose to watch on TV or the internet it just keeps going down hill. Christianity is portrayed as a joke in many programs and this is where society is getting their ideas about God. We can't say the name Jesus in school or pass out a Bible. There are children in gangs because that is the only place they think they belong. There are FATHERS that have abandoned their children for life styles that land them in jail. Babies are killed for the sake of convenience. Porn is ruining marriages.   All hope is not lost though. Jesus is the Victor. His word will go forth even when it becomes illegal to do so. It is all ready going forth around the world where His Word can get you killed. Voice of the Martyrs has many current story's about this.  All we can do brother is keep pressing toward the mark and pray that all that he calls will say yes, save me, send me, strengthen me.|`|grwtwPbAaa	Not sure!  :)  Who can honestly say...what all is coming...it will rain on the just and unjust brother...everywhere!  :)|`|qnaGMFAGaa	I believe we'll reap what Jesus has sowed  if we Simply trust what he accomplished at the cross.

If He spared not the angels in Heaven, and spared not Israel, why would we arrogantly think He would spare the US? Having said that, there is the option for the nation to repent before it is too late. (as Ninevah did).     **** 2 Chronicles 7:14****  If my people who are called by my name, shall humble themselves and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then I will hear from Heaven, and will forgive their sins and heal their land.

Just a heavy heart . But then as I was thinking ,I remembered that our Nation isn't the only one with sins galore .     I was readin one day in Amos. And in it the Lord God said that the day is coming when people will seek the world over for the Word of God and won't find it .That is the biggest tragedy I can think of for the world . I guess we won't be here , as ' the word of God is nigh thee,even in thy mouth' .   Then, still in Amos , God was angry at some folks and said, you make melodies and sing songs that are empty. I was amazed to read this . I sing to the Lord, but I am also a little bit country and a little bit rock-n-roll . And I was thinking to myself. WOW,   I can't even imagine the grace that I/we are under .     For if our heart condemns us ,God is greater than our heart , and knows all things . 1John3:19,20    My thoughts are that if something befalls this Country ( and we are going to experience some things that are necessary to ushering in THE Anti-Christ . ) that we as God's people are going to be taken care of by Him . Come what may . And to that I say, lets be ready in case revival bursts open .

It tells not only what we will reap as a nation, but also on a global scale and a personal level.   The Bible says that we will return to days of Noah and that there will be a revived roman empire in the last days.

God is no longer judging any nation because 2,000 years ago He has already judged everyone's sins at the cross, when Jesus bore the punishment carrying our sins on His own body.    "that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation." 2 Corinthians 5:19    Yes, there are natural consequences of sins, but they are not a result of God's punishment or judgment. Otherwise, terrorists can always say they are doing the will of God and justify their heinous acts of terrorism. What we should learn is to continue sharing the gospel of grace - Jesus saves whoever comes to Him; and He will make all things new and whole again. :)    God bless you, brother, and thanks for the thought-provoking question. :)    -----    Amen to Sister Grace's answer.

I am learning 3 languages currently.<br>  <br>  What Obama said was harsh but true---he did not necessarily kiss American's butt and sugar coat it he was telling the truth.<br>  With our educational facilities and the potential of every human not just Americans we should easily be able to speak more than 1 language.<br>  It comes down to the school systems and the lack of stronf foreign language departments that are limiting the chance of bilinguism in America.<br>  How do you expect students to learn another language when most schools start foreign languages in High School and only require 2 years?<br>  <br>  1. Start foreign language education earlier<br>  2. Make it more than 2 years<br>  ______________<br>  <br>  It would only benefit us.<br>  <br>  According to Wikipedia 82% of Americans speak ONLY English.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_o...</a><br>  ________________<br>  <br>  Also there is no "catering" to Immigrants.<br>  It is a requirement to have a intermediate knowledge of the English language in order to become a U.S. Citizen (this excludes senior citizens, young children, and mentally handicap for obvious reasons).<br>  <br>  Check out the Citizenship test:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_nationality_law#Naturalization" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Stat...</a><br>  <br>  _______________<br>  <br>  I know it is not impossible to learn languages at a older age because I am 16 and currently learning 3 languages.<br>  Like you mentioned it is harder.<br>  If we implement foreign language education at an earlier level, like elementary school we can have students who are fluent or very conversational by the time they have reached High School (they would have taken the foreign language for 7-8 years)<br>  And when they reach High School it should be optional to take foreign languages, but we should still offer them.<br>  In it's place they should make it mandatory to take 2 years of Finance and Economics in High School, which would help educate Americans on how to manage their money (most Americans don't know anything until they get out their and then it is too late).<br>  This would make it so they have more Foreign language experience (7-8 years plus more if they continue in High School)<br>  Also Finance and Economics classes for the future.<br>  __________<br>  <br>  I agree there is catering to Illegals, not to LEGAL immigrants like I was talking about above.<br>  <br>  If you realize however that most illegals are being catered to by American business owners who are trying to hire them for the lowest possible wages.<br>  The U.S. government is doing their job by making the LEGAL immigrants learn English--but we can't really enforce illegals to learn something when they break the laws in the first place, can we?<br>  _____________<br>  <br>  @ Fallen One---I suggested that we make foreign language optional at the high school level (so it would be an elective), but mandatory at Elementary to Middle.<br>  I also suggested that in its place we make it mandatory to take Finance and Economics which would help Americans financially in his/her future<br>  <br>  Personally, I think that we should give a variety of languages--not just Spanish.<br>  Spanish only education really limits people.<br>  <br>  Right now we have (at high school levels)<br>  Spanish, French, German, Latin<br>  and ocassionally<br>  Japanese, Chinese (mandarin), and Italian<br>  rarely (but still found in some high schools)<br>  Arabic, Russian, and Hindi<br>  <br>  I don't think we should go backwards and go Spanish only.<br>  But I do agree with you in the part that Spanish is the most important foreign language in the U.S. Right now<br>  _____________-<br>  <br>  @ Fallen One<br>  at my high school<br>  they make a mandatory class<br>  Gov/Econ<br>  Which is Government and Economics where you learn about Government, Law, and Economics<br>  I think that is a good idea to give students an idea of how the whole system works<br>  ______________<br>  <br>  Do I think Americans should know 3-5 languages? No, it is possible but is highly unlikely (most Americans--82%-- cannot even speak 2)<br>  Do I think Americans should know 2?<br>  Yes, we have a all the resources available and it would only benefit us.|`|qJkRPhIKaa	America is a melting pot.<br>  <br>  We have asians<br>  africans<br>  mexicans<br>  germans<br>  irish <br>  <br>  etc...<br>  <br>  Yet we only know two languages if that. In my opinion it is sad. We should know 3-5 languages since our country is full of people who think they are too good to learn english then come. <br>  <br>  So not being able to communicate with these people is frustrating and embarassing. I mean cmon not being able to speak the same language as someone in your own country?<br>  <br>  Also i think he is pointing out that other countrys have much better schools and they learn more. This may be true however i think most of the education those countrys learn is for showing off.

Instead of learning geometry as a lawyer who does no math past algebra 1, the student could learn another language allowing him to speak with his clients better.|`|K5zjHJ2Oaa	do your research everyone in the world that is living in a developed nation speaks another language besides their national one. Canada teaches french to all their students even the ones not living in Quebec|`|v6QA809aaa	i think it's the word "embarrassment" that made you feel bad.<br>  i think perhaps he's trying to sound humble so he used that word|`|iWaU76T5aa	Ok here is an argument, an average Japanese man can only speak Japanese and in some cases English but yet the Japanese are a lot more intelligent than the Europeans. Europeans speak those different languages because of the fact that the nations are so close together and since all of the nations are developed, there is so much friendly immigration (people go to a nation to just go to a nation). An average Dutch high school drop out can speak 5 languages fluently but does that mean he is smarter than an American university professor who can only speak English?<br>  <br>  I really do not see how taking Spanish in high school helped me, I do plan on learning French when I move to Canada but my view on the bilingual argument is that, America is a nation of many many many immigrants. One immigrant may speak Hindi, another Spanish, another French, another German etc. That is what makes us unique but regardless, English is and always will be the common denominator EVEN in a nation as diverse as the US. In our high schools foreign languages should not be mandatory but rather in our middle schools and elementary schools. Our high schools should prepare us for real life and classes like Law and ethics should prepare us for real life. <br>  <br>  Knowing a foreign language does not make your IQ higher, it just helps you out more in case you travel.<br>  <br>  To Bob B: Foreign Languages should be out of high school period, get it over with in elementary and middle school. Kids will learn it and retain it. High school should prepare people for real life and careers.<br>  <br>  Foreign Languages over math?<br>  Get out of here!<br>  Math is THE MOST crucial subject in high school, you will always use math whether you like it or not and other countries have better schools than us for outside reasons. How often do you hear of gang banging and students carrying guns to school in Germany and France?<br>  <br>  Bob B I like how you are thinking but at best, foreign languages should be electives come high school time, finance may help but still law is far more mandatory. By elementary school and middle school the foreign language study should be finished, the challenge is, should students get to decide what language to take instead of just taking Spanish all the way?<br>  <br>  There are parts in Louisiana and some Northeastern States on border with Canada where knowing French can come in handy.<br>  <br>  To Bob B: Finance is really for bankers but a year of it will do no harm, it should be implemented at the Senior year since students will retain it more. Economics? I do not believe that Americans need to know about aggregate demand and supply, economics is basically that. Law should be mandatory for at least a year or two.<br>  <br>  I do agree that making only Spanish available limits people but unfortunately that is what they may end up doing. Pennsylvania (Western that is) has made Spanish mandatory from grades 1-7 which is complete crap, students along with parents should have more option.<br>  <br>  To Bob B:<br>  Government should not be mandatory for a semester as it is in many schools but rather for a year if it is to be mandatory at all. So this would be ideal<br>  <br>  Freshman - Government<br>  Sophomore - Economics<br>  Junior - Law<br>  Senior - finance<br>  <br>  each will be 1 year courses<br>  <br>  Also I would like to make a closing statement. Americans (US) in general will always be behind Europe when it comes to Public education (high school). We are too big of a nation for the government to control and our high schools are always full of those 60 percent who are there just to be there and not get bored at home. Things like drugs (weed and such) and gang violence are common in most American public high schools so with all off those factors involved, HOW CAN our students learn better than the Europeans or the Japanese?<br>  We have the highest crime rate out of all developed nations so that contributes to our students not having the best social conditions and single parent homes are so common in America, I mean with all of these factors, how are our students supposed to be the best?<br>  <br>  Regardless though, we have the best colleges on earth.|`|OtLqGZK8aa	I doubt he means that we should all learn Spanish so that we can cater to Spanish speaking immigrants so you don't have to worry about that. Americans always assumes that when people say that it would benefit them to learn another language most automatically say "I don't feel that I need to because immigrants should know English when they come to this country and we shouldn't have to cater to them". Who said that learning another language is only useful for catering to immigrants? I agree with everything he said.<br>  <br>  BTW I'm American but I speak Spanish and there are a lot of things I can do with that like become a translator, travel to Spanish speaking countries, become a Spanish teacher etc... none of that involves catering to immigrants.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I doubt that he thinks we should be just as multilingual as Europeans, that's not possible because of what you have already mentioned. In that case we would only know Spanish and English (maybe French because of Canada but not really). Europeans have easy acces to native speakers of pretty much all major European languages.
XN0cYCATaa	Is a bat a bird?  Leviticus 11:13-19    (Leviticus 11:19) - "These, moreover, you shall detest among the birds; they are abhorrent, not to be eaten: the eagle and the vulture and the buzzard, 14and the kite and the falcon in its kind, 15every raven in its kind, 16 and the ostrich and the owl and the sea gull and the hawk in its kind, 17and the little owl and the cormorant and the great owl, 18and the white owl and the pelican and the carrion vulture, 19and the stork, the heron in its kinds, and the hoopoe, and the bat."          In verse 13 Moses tells us about the birds and then he lists them out.  In verse 19 we see the bat is included in this list.  We know that a bat is not a bird.  Does this not mean that the Bible is incorrect?       The Bible is not meant to be a scientific description of modern biological categories. Instead, it is often written from the perspective of what we see. In other words, it makes generic categorizations. In this case, the bat is categorized as a bird because like birds, it flies and is similar in size to most birds. If we did not know that it was a mammal, it would be natural to call it a bird. To the Hebrew of ancient times, calling it a bird was perfectly logical. But, in modern times with our science of being able to categorize animal species, we know that the bat is actually a mammal and not a bird.       Also, we must be aware that it is modern science that has a different classification system than ancient times.  To the ancients, creatures such as a bat were considered birds since they categorized all flying animals as birds.  If that is the category that they used, then they were correct.  It is not an error.  It is a difference of categorization procedures.  The critic has imposed upon the ancient text a modern system of categorization and then said that the Bible is wrong.|`|MqXbtvP9aa	warm blooded|`|kIblsxJQaa	Cos the bible was written in a time before it was discovered that the bat is mammal and not a bird.|`|246ef99fe9f19ae4da709934694ddcd8aa	Their god must have changed it into a mammal later.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	It gives birth to live young, after a placental pregnancy.

Keep in mind that we could have chosen to leave a more narrow classification for all winged animals and called them birds.  Mammal is a term later developed as technology as well as terminology advanced.    . Science = systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation.    Science itself does not prove that man is an evolved animal but men who have observed using a system and exerimentation have made this claim in the name of science.  Evolutionary man is still not a law, it is one of many many theories.

Classification of animals and things was made by different means: function or form. In this case, the word we render birds means simply "owner of a wing", the word being 'owph, which comes from a root word which means to cover or to fly.    The category of 'owph includes birds, bats, and certain insects. It would also have included pterosaurs, if they had been around. Even modern ecologists classify water-dwelling life in a very similar way according to their mode of living: plankton (floaters/drifters), nekton (swimmers) and benthos (bottom-dwellers). It's similar to refuting geocentrism charges against the Bible by showing that even modern astronomers use terms like "sunset" and "sunrise" without being accused of being geocentrists, so why shouldn't we make the same allowance for the Bible writers.|`|47f596346f675aa52012de1d79feedc9aa	Definitions of words change over time.

First, you are completely wrong.  People are born gay.  You would know that if you ever knew anyone gay long enough to watch them grow as a child to an adult.  No...there is no gay gene, it's not a genetic problem, it's a hormonal problem during gestation. You have no eductation in genetics or evolution and yet you act as though what you belief is correct.  It's not.  Gay are born...and even if they weren't, you don't have the right to try to make their lives miserable.  They deserve the same rights as all of us.|`|FarsCSY1aa	Ever heard of bonobos? Many of them are ridiculously bisexual. I'm sure they'd have realized by now male+male =/= baby. Also, in humans, sex ISN'T just for procreation. I have a g-spot, and I don't care what the gender of the person is who stimulated it is, just as long as it happens. (Then again, I'm bi.)<br>  <br>  Every closeted gay person is proof it is not a choice. Perhaps it isn't genes, but we do know it's not a choice. That being said, just respect their way of life. Preaching against gays will not make gays any less gay.|`|zQyslfHKaa	They have no sexual desires or urges.

It's also not a fact that animals don't have sex for pleasure.  Our understanding of the animal kingdom continues to grow over time.  We don't know nearly enough about animal behavior to make sweeping judgments and use them to argue for or against the existence of a "gay gene" in absolute terms.|`|JOankL0eaa	So, the Pigmy/Bonobo chimps have no sexual urges..nor do dolphins right? WRONG. These species also have sex for other reasons besides reproduction. <br>  <br>  And how is a sexual desire not a mating instinct? That's exactly what it is. And there are gay animals. And humans didn't evolve from apes, we are apes and we share a common ancestor with other apes. Homosexuality can be both a choice and ''something'' you are born with.|`|ylaGS5EHaa	hmmm, someone accused you of ignorance with out any logic or proof, wonder who's the ignorant one. I would have to agree with you though. There are many different branches of psychology, all with a different ideas of what causes homosexual behavior.

If seemingly "homosexual" acts among animals are in accordance with animal nature, then parental killing of offspring and intra-species devouring are also in accordance with animal nature. Bringing man into the equation complicates things further. Are we to conclude that filicide and cannibalism are according to human nature? <br>  In opposition to this line of reasoning, this article sustains that: <br>  <br>  "There is no "homosexual instinct" in animals, <br>  It is poor science to "read" human motivations and sentiments into animal behavior, and <br>  Irrational animal behavior is not a yardstick to determine what is morally acceptable behavior for rational man."<br>  <br>  The full article is at this link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.narth.com/docs/animalmyth.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.narth.com/docs/animalmyth.htm...</a><br>  <br>  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...<br>  <br>  It's so clear now shows an excellent article on a "controversial" website.  Here is another of about 200 articles on a reparative therapy website:<br>  <br>  "The critical factor is that if one identical twin is homosexual, only sometimes is the co-twin homosexual. There is no argument about this in the scientific community.<br>  <br>  <br>  Interpretation<br>  Identical twins have identical genes. If homosexuality was a biological condition produced inescapably by the genes (e.g. eye color), then if one identical twin was homosexual, in 100% of the cases his brother would be too. But we know that only about 38% of the time is the identical twin brother homosexual. Genes are responsible for an indirect influence, but on average, they do not force people into homosexuality. This conclusion has been well known in the scientific community for a few decades (e.g. 6) but has not reached the general public. Indeed, the public increasingly believes the opposite."<br>  <br>  The full article is here as well as 200+ more articles:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.narth.com/docs/whitehead2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.narth.com/docs/whitehead2.htm...</a>|`|t8JlnuqFaa	On April 14, 2003, the International Human Genome Consortium announced the successful completion of the Human Genome Project.<br>  As the data began to pour in, they allowed scientists to construct gene maps—using actual sequences from the Human Genome Project.  And yet, neither the map for the X nor the Y chromosome contains any “gay gene.”<br>  What is the truth regarding homosexuality?  Too often, speculation, emotions, and politics play a major role in the assessment.<br>  <br>  Consider the obvious problem of survival for individuals who allegedly possess a gay gene: individuals who have partners of the same sex are biologically unable to reproduce (without resorting to artificial means).  Therefore, if an alleged “gay gene” did exist, the homosexual population eventually would disappear altogether.  We now know that it is not scientifically accurate to refer to a “gay gene” as the causative agent in homosexuality.  The available evidence clearly establishes that no such gene has been identified.  Additionally, evidence exists which documents that homosexuals can change their sexual orientation.|`|w2sdYZ1Haa	I believe in the fact that people are born with a 'gay' gene, and aren't just trying to rebel against society (frankly there are easier, better ways to rebel). I would say that this gene evolved with the coming of products containing extensive chemicals that upset the chemical balance of a person's DNA, thus giving a guy an extra X chromosome, or a girl an extra Y chromosome. When I went to a wildlife reserve last year, the guide said that a lot of the animals were technically turning gay because some company had dumped chemicals containing estrogen into the waters, which fits with my theory. Good luck with your battle|`|QbfiRykHaa	Humans, Homo sapien, evolved not from any one "ape" that exists today. We're considered a Great Ape, and we share common genetic ancestry with apes.<br>  Our closest genetic relative is considered the Bonobo, Pan paniscus: also known as the "Pygmy Chimpanzee," we're both members of the Hominidae family (along with gorillas and orangutans).<br>  Chimpanzee are thought to have split from human evolution about 6 million years ago, and the Bonobo from Common Chimpanzees about 1 million years ago.<br>  <br>  Now, as far as being genetically gay? Perhaps the better question would be how are people genetically straight?<br>  <br>  Homosexual and bisexual behavior are widespread in the animal kingdom: a 1999 review by researcher Bruce Bagemihl shows that homosexual behavior, has been observed in close to 1500 species, ranging from primates to gut worms, and is well documented for 500 of them. The Bonobo, which has a matriarchal society (unusual amongst apes), is a fully bisexual species -- both males and females engage in heterosexual and homosexual behavior, being noted for lesbianism in particular. About 60% of all sexual activity in this species is between two or more females. While the homosexual bonding system in Bonobos represent the highest frequency of homosexuality known in any species, homosexuality has been reported for all great apes (a group which includes humans), as well as a number of other primate species.|`|YvvcsdUUaa	No one is born gay. Yes, you can have feminine hormones and can even take specific pills to enhance certain hormones. but its impossible to be born gay. It is infact a choice. As a human we gradually learn to take care of ourselves and be the person we want to be. Well if we want to be and are attracted to someone of the same sex. that just makes us gay. we are not born with it. Its not something genetic. its something mental. our minds just take us to our conclusion which also leads to our body language towards the same sex..attraction.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	First of all, apes never evolved into humans. We both evolved from a common ancestor.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of animal species which engage in homosexual intercourse. Male dolphins have nasal sex with other male dolphins, and this appears to be motivated by pleasure, not a procreative instinct. "Gay" male penguins also form mating relationships that last for life. Bonobos have lesbian relationships nearly 60% of the time, and they are bonding relationships  involving affection. It simply isn't true to say that animals have sex only for procreation.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	You are incorrect about animals. A percentage of almost all animal species are homosexual. Among animals that mate for life, same-sex pairs are common. Same-sex pairs will often adopt and raise orphaned young. Homosexuality is especially common in certain species of duck, and in bonobos.<br>  <br>  Many species practice recreational sex, including mutual masturbation, oral sex, and among marine mammals, one can find males inserting their penis into the blowhole of their mate.|`|6jAVElX7aa	homosexuals arent born gay. So dont want to take responsibilty for their behaviour and tell the lie that they were born that way. God has made man a little lower than the angels, but above the animals, that is why Adam was allowed to name each animal and take care of them|`|QpPzXqIVaa	That's a very confusing idea... but humans are not merely animals, our minds are far more complex can distinguish lust and love. If animals have sex to reproduce, humans have sex for reproduction AND for pleasure.<br>  There's the difference.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	Ignorance is surely the darkest of fates.<br>  <br>  "It has been said that homosexuality isn't a choice but people are born with the sexual desire & attraction.?"<br>  <br>  This has not been "said."  It has been *proven*.<br>  <br>  "It's a fact that animals aren't gay. They have no sexual desires or urges. They mate only to reproduce. It instinct that makes them mate when they are in heat. They didn't learn it from their parents or friends or school or TV. Some, like dogs, have been seen humping another male dog. It's not a gay desire but a mating instinct."<br>  <br>  Absolutely false.  You obviously do not even understand what instinct is.  What is sexual desire, if not instinct?  Sexual attraction to others of your species is reproductive instinct.  <br>  <br>  As for animals not being gay, that is just plain silly.  About 15% of all organisms of all animal species with separate sexes are homosexual.  In some species, such as bonobos, this is even higher (in that case, about 40%).  I personally own a bisexual pony and two other gay horses.<br>  <br>  In regards to evolution, individual genes do not "evolve."  They arise from mutations.  Obviously, ones like homosexuality are not beneficial as they prevent reproduction.  That means that you don't have to inherit the gene to be gay.  As homosexuality has so many varied genetic and biological causations, it can still be quite common without being passed on.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	Gay people are born gay and their desires and attraction toward the same sex evolves naturally as we mature--the same way it happens to those who choose the heterosexual lifestyle.<br>  <br>  Same-sex activity has been documented in many species.  You can have your opinions on the how's and why's but to say it doesn't happen is to ignore the examples in nature.  Some such as penguins even raise offspring together.<br>  <br>  The gay gene like every other gene was created by God.  Clearly, He did not want everyone to be gay which is why the world is overpopulated today.  Just as clearly, He intended some of us to be gay which is why we are present in every time, place and culture.  If you have questions about that, perhaps you should ask God?<br>  <br>  This idea that being gay is a "choice" is concocted by unrepentant homophobes in order to recruit gay people into "ex-gay" scams (and make money for the leaders of the scams) or to justify their own homophobia.  Homophobia is a choice and they should "choose" to leave this wicked behavior behind.

I feel that life is made as we traverse the unknown...step by step....moment by moment, not ever fully knowing where we are being lead. And this is ok because all things are changing along with us in our moment, so a certain faith or trust in ones life is all one might manage to rise up to in order to confidently keep on walking in the all pervasive unknown.

tRZ0DZtSaa	Sigh.  'Satanic' metal is not a big as you think. Also most of the bands who do you satan as a theme in their songs are not Satanists in anyway. For example American metal band Slayer is though to be satanic by those who don't know any better but the vocalist is a practising Catholic.   Example 2. Members of Swedish band Dissection, founded the Misanthropic Luciferian Order, despite the name they are not satanists.   Some of these 'satanic' bands might be just anti-Christian (because they are neo-pagans and Christianity is an introduced religion) or nihilistic in their outlook.   Personally, I don't believe in god but I do think the idea of the devil is interesting.|`|96AQZUGyaa	Firstly it is a shock tactic. When you see a guy on stage licking a decapitated sheep's head or something, you tend to stop and look.    Secondly these bands are quite against organized Christianity. I'm not certain why but I know quite a few bands that are. Anyway, due to their dislike of Christianity they have chosen the enemy of Christianity (Satan) as a type of ally (probably because of the mentality in Christianity that says "believe or burn".) However many of these musicians are NOT Satanists at all but use it to symbolize a rebellion from Christianity.    For example, the singer of one of the most iconic black metal bands (Gorgoroth) said this about the subject:    "We live in a Christian world and we have to speak their language ... When I use the word Satan, it means the natural order, the will of a man, the will to grow, the will to become the superman and not to be oppressed by any law such as the church, which is only a way to control the masses" - Gaahl    So you see, he is not a Satanist but uses it to represent his opposition to the organized church (which frankly is quite dominating and controlling of people).|`|2sLv6uXtaa	becuz those countries have no morals and or faith.|`|jw6Lpt37aa	because the personal freedom  more there than any place in the whole world|`|f7c5f574e4f1a6efb425246391dcb433aa	i think you must believe in religion to believe in the devil, i don't|`|AjdaezeTaa	its because people like the idea that its a satanic band.  even tho they could just be screaming atheist, and not believe in satan at all.  it brings up questions.  scares mothers... lol  and eventually give them a fan base.|`|283tO9j9aa	I don't know what kind of metalheads they are but that isn't strictly true. There is a black metal scene in Norway that is notorious for setting fire to churches and murdering each other, however, it's only a small group and it is frowned upon by the rest of the metal community as it gives us all a bad name.    Most Scandinavian bands aren't particularly bothered about religion- it's their business as individuals rather than anything that comes out in their music. However, there are quite a few bands with both pagan and Christian imagery- the 'battle metal' bands use a lot of Norse mythology, and Nightwish (who are Finnish) use Christian themes in their songs.    I think that the 'Satanists' thing in metal comes more from its origins, people like Black Sabbath and Alice Cooper. Back then. they did things to shock and entertain, and most people thought it was funny because it was basically showmanship. Plus, Black Sabbath sang about the devil etc- however they said to stay away from evil things. People didn't listen properly apparently.    Metal has always been about trying to get a reaction from people- whether that's laughter when you entertain them with a great show or putting a load of fake blood in that show to annoy the parents. However, some take it too far and this is where the bad reputation comes from.|`|hHePDPncaa	dunno might be to do with all the time of darkness they get in the year or it could just be their culture|`|dE7b0odvaa	Trend.  Also the Vikings kind of had a chip on their shoulders for a while towards Christians.|`|57af3cd106168b01009e4dbbc6d55acbaa	Actually they are losing ground    Scandinavian countries are right now thankfully becoming more open and warmer toward Christianity than you can imagine ... it seems that while Europe is going back to it's roots the USA is leaving it ... basically Europe is becoming more religious and USA less religious ( I think that you didn't know this )    Read these links    France http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005...

8G42oyydaa	Haven't, or haven't known because I do not discuss politics or religion with strangers and usually not with friends. Its a good way to make enemies and in the greater scheme of things, why bother? Neither of you will change the others opinions.|`|UllYFJgjaa	Yes, I did share a room at the hospital years ago and even though we didn't discuss our religious or political views, she would not share that remote control!!  lol|`|rJJhMQ37aa	I have shared a hospital room a few times, but never discussed religion or politics.  Made it much easier, I am sure.|`|nwnILcEAaa	On the few occasions when I was in a hospital and shared a room, I wasn't thinking about religion or politics. Too many other things became important.|`|xyt9NdjVaa	I'm sure I have, but those subjects were not discussed. It has been many, many years that I was in a 'shared' hospital room.|`|a4LWildhaa	No never. Don't discuss those subjects.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	Those are two of the worst subjects to talk to anyone about. As no<br>  two people think alike. And you are sure to run into forbidden territory<br>  with a stranger, not knowing their views on either subject. So it's<br>  best to talk about simple subjects. Or maybe the hospital you are in.<br>  Maybe talk about the food. That's one subject where the other person<br>  may certainly agree with you.<br>     When I was a young woman, my mother warned me never to talk<br>  with friends about politics or religion, because most likely they <br>  wouldn't agree with my thoughts, or maybe I wouldn't with theirs. And<br>  she said that politics was another area to avoid. She proved she was<br>  right, as I learned later on. And now I try to avoid both subjects and<br>  remain in friendly territory.|`|oP3VVW5raa	I have shared a hospital room with other on 2 separate occasions and neither time did it enter my head to talk about religion or politics.<br>  <br>  I have met people of other religious backgrounds and we have spoken about each others religion but it was no different to talking to them about what country they were from or what movies they have seen lately or what their hobbies are.|`|1NO10YfPaa	The last time this 62 year old future Democrat and Atheist happened to be in a hospital was when she was born.  Guess there were some future Republicans and religious people in the maternity ward, especially since I was born and raised in the Deep South. :-)|`|O9FojdEMaa	yes i have and i made it a point to witness to them in regards to their need for CHRIST in their lives.|`|acaJSqW6aa	what room?  ...who gets a room now days?<br>  You get a recovery room with about 5-6 others and then out the door.|`|aXYiOskmaa	i wouldn't know as i make it a point never to discuss politics or religion. especially with those i don't know.|`|AcFBETxAaa	Yep, and there was big trouble. I moved back home.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	No, the subject never came up.|`|W8bs2VQSaa	When I've been in hospital I've usually been feeling far too sick to talk about anything besides "do you want the window open or closed". I don't regard hospital as a place for in-depth discussions about politics or religion, in fact I rarely discus them at any time.|`|CERiinCtaa	Actually, it was great. It gave me a whole new outlook on things. The minute we would start bickering about our differences we would explore a new outlook on religion and perceive speculating indifferences about the all mighty one himself. He tried to convert me to a johovas witness, and we fight about it every week. He pulled up good points, but we are the best of friends. In fact, he even mentioned courting once!|`|VWAl3tcnaa	I was too sick and too depressed to socialize with the other patient, and all I was concern about was getting out of the hospital.  I hate hospitals.|`|AA12399021	Not only in a hospital room but I make it a "no-no" to discuss politics or religious views especially with someone I don't know.|`|AA11570788	I never discuss those subjects anywhere with anyone.|`|YBRQsmLMaa	Yes! It was quite good ,thanx to that sexy nurse  on duty.|`|HZgjUguWaa	I kept very quiet & stayed to myself
WNIL4sLiaa	So long as it's not a sexual attraction, but be very careful; you may find them desirable and that can lead into an act you will be sorry for. Remember the old adage, A stiff c. . k has no conscious.<br>  Not to mention, if you are with someone younger than age of consent and are only being a friend and someone knows your sexual orientation, even though you didn't do anything wrong, you can be accused of such. Once you wear that jacket you can never get it off.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	I've seen children that I've thought were exceptionally beautiful. Stare worthy beautiful. I'm not attracted to people younger than 17ish though, I'm just not. In fact I'm mostly attracted to people way older than me. As long as you don't act on anything, it's not wrong.|`|4kqvnQtUaa	Maby you just miss your innocense at that age, now that you have more responsibility in your life?|`|DIj072Sqaa	There's a difference between finding someone attractive and desirable and finding them sexually appealing. Once again I can only speak for myself but I can certainly look at a teenager and think that they're really cute however that's my limit as one of the key factors in attraction is emotional maturity and very few teenagers demonstrate that. If it's almost impossible to get that match from someone who's 18-19 then I don't see much point in looking for younger than that. Still there isn't a set age when someone becomes attractive - in some cases it's can be younger than an age when I would consider approaching them but my own judgement call would be to leave them well alone.<br>  <br>  As I've got older my tastes have got older as well.|`|zRPXczxAaa	In the ancient world, the preferred age differential was about fifteen years.  Frankly, I see nothing wrong with what is called, alarmedly, pedophilia or pederasty.  I speak as one who enjoyed the favors of much older male relatives from the time I was a very little boy until I was a teen-ager.  I regret not a single moment of it.  Not only was it, perhaps, the best sex I ever had, it was loving, courteous, affirming--never scary or overwhelming.  I hasten to say that when I reached maturity I was not myself attracted to younger boys--but it would be a betrayal of some of the most beautiful--and inspiring--moments of my existence to deny that my experience as a boy beloved of men was wholesome, proper, and of great benefit to me in facing life as an adult fearlessly and self-confidently.<br>  <br>  Now, let me tell you what are vicious and abominable ways of treating a child:  Scolding, browbeating, insulting or being rude to a child; hurting a child; slapping, spanking, striking, kicking, or beating a child; starving, maiming, torturing or murdering a child.  Where ever did we get the notion that having sex with a child was even a particle as bad as any of those things?--or, indeed, bad at all?  Such horrific unreason has largely to do with the beastly inhumanity of the Christian tradition, no doubt--but it has also something to do with our allowing depraved swine like the late J. Edgar Hoover to set our national moral standards for us; and, at yet another remove, of taking our notions of "normal human" psychology from the profoundly anti-humanist fraudulence of Freud, Adler, Jung, Neumann, Reik, Erikson, Fromm, etc.|`|v4qLlGGhaa	This is a pedophile profile. You will go to jail if you decide to act on these feelings. There is no gray area in our society. <br>  <br>  Kids are kids. You, as the adult, are responsible for making the right decision. You must obey the law.|`|jQ0kSIXIaa	I was molested as a child by a grown man. I think I agree with Rick.|`|PRaEOK9Maa	No it's not wrong obviously you aren't a pedofile since you are concerned enough to ask a question about it. And honestly a lot of the people freaking out are probably like 12 and still think 21 is old and seem to forget that you were a teenager a whopping 2 years ago. If you were 40 it'd be wrong. Don't worry about it :)|`|1rmSuG2Haa	My maternal instict says I'm glad I know so I can keep you away from my son.<br>  <br>  My open-minded awareness says, great. Be who you are, as long as you keep those thoughts TO YOURSELF and don't act on them. Or else you may find yourself locked in prision for a Veryyyyy longggg time.<br>  <br>  Did someone molest or rape you when you were younger? Its probably a repressed aspect of yourself..|`|l8c2kTlvaa	I think it is a little strange. But as long as you don't do anything more than think a young guy is attractive, then you aren't hurting anyone so its ok.|`|OMgF0RcIaa	Yes I think it is wrong...and weird. But it is the way you feel and you can't really help that. Just make sure you don't act on those feelings!|`|MzMfafKLaa	I think it's really natural; as long as you don't follow up on the 'desires' at your age. I feel the same way; younger boys are really cute twinks.|`|6KsIsFbaaa	mm its a bit odd,but older men have<br>   complimented me and im 17<br>  <br>  and i mean like from the ages of 18 and 25 at least|`|72rbetinaa	As long as you don't act on it, I wouldn't say that it's wrong. It is a little weird, though.|`|d28067f1a921a90f7f3de7ed58b0e54caa	My straight friends used to say that about young girls............I know them they wouldnt do something stupid......But nowadays young kids are dressed like little sluts........Parents are to blame...........|`|I0A1DXBSaa	This seems to be a very controversial topic, naturally.<br>  <br>  At first I think it's natural for anyone to immediately say "of course it's wrong!".<br>  Though, when I do contemplate the matter I find I can empathise with you, in some way.<br>  When I was 13 (which wasn't that long ago) I had a very mature mind.<br>  So, it depends all on those particulars and how mature they are.<br>  <br>  Besides, you may be getting older physically but not mentally.<br>  If you were 30 it would be different. But, personally 21 isn't necessarily that sordid, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Best Wishes.|`|ANOBEJPXaa	No, not really. Think of it this way: If you're attracted to an older guy and he's attracted to you, does that make him creepy? Everybody is either older or younger than you, and there's always an older one and a younger one in every relationship. That doesn't make the older one strange.|`|BIoCl9Qqaa	there is a stigma about older people being attracted to younger people, no matter the age.  how young is really up for debate in peoples minds.  people can't control who they find attractive.  <br>  <br>  i've seen people who were younger than me and thought, "wow they will be cute when they get older".  nothing more than that.  its not a attraction but a judgment call. <br>  <br>  now i can see people a few years younger and find them attractive.  i think it might have to do with our culture (gay culture) and how young, hot, and fit is all there is.  hit 30 and your ancient and done fore.|`|KmXE5SxOaa	nah man i completely get you. <br>  haha i've been attracted to ppl that are like 13, and i'm 17 . it's not wrong, its totally natural, people are people age is just a number yoo.  you know there are people that don't even know their age in like africa?<br>  okay rambling... <br>  and you said it's not sexual, you just find them hot, so whatevs. you're good. now if you wanted them in bed.. that's another story lol<br>  but youre fine.|`|nkpj18xjaa	I agree with Cameron.|`|bOrthb6faa	No but its creepy as heck.|`|PZODV3QQaa	Okay please don't **** him us gays have a ****** up rep anyways get therapy|`|3Iwu4vIVaa	you are sick and I wish I could chop your co-ck off.

And well, they teach me, though I contacted the Church. So it's pretty effective. They are effective, I mean.    They do more than ring doorbells. They help out with the local ward a lot and are constantly studying Scriptures and aiming to come to closer to the Lord.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	I think they look soooo cute on their bikes.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Being that our religion almost doubles in size every decade and on an average day more than 1000 people decide to be baptized I'd say quite a few stop and listen.

YEcY1b1Saa	I very much agree.<br>  those who believe in him shall NOT parish but have everlasting life. <br>  ;)|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	ditto....|`|wY8jE8HEaa	Just after these verses Allah states the following in The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 4, Verse 159: There is not one of the People of the Book who will not believe in him before he dies; and on the Day of Rising he will be a witness against them. (The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 4, Verse: 159) <br>  <br>  The statement above "who will not believe in him before he dies" is important. The Arabic text of this sentence reads: Wa-in min ahli'l-kitabi illa la yuminanna bihi qabla mawtihi.<br>  Some scholars stated that the "him/it" in this verse is used for the Qur'an and thus made the following interpretation: There will be no one from the people of the Book who will not have faith in the Qur'an before he (a person from the people of the Book) dies.<br>  Nevertheless, in verses 157 and 158, which are the two verses preceding this verse, the same "him" is undoubtedly used for Jesus (pbuh). The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 4, Verse 157: <br>  <br>  And (on account of) their saying, "We killed the Messiah, 'Isa/Jesus son of Maryam, Messenger of Allah." They did not kill him and they did not crucify him but it was made to seem so to them. Those who argue about him are in doubt about it. They have no real knowledge of it, just conjecture. But they certainly did not kill him. The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 4, Verse 158: Allah raised him up to Himself. Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. <br>  <br>  Just after these verses in The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 4, Verse 159, there is no evidence indicating that "him" is used to imply someone other than Jesus (pbuh). The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 4, Verse 159: There is not one of the People of the Book who will not believe in him before he dies; and on the Day of Rising he will be a witness against them. <br>  <br>  In the Qur'an, Allah informs us that on the Day of Judgement, the "tongues and hands and feet will testify against them about what they were doing" (The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 24, Verse 24 and The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 36, Verse 65). From The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 41, Verses 20-23, we learn that "hearing, sight and skin will testify against us." In none of the verses however, is there reference to "the Qur'an as a witness". If we accept that the "him" or "it" in the first sentence refers to the Qur'an – though grammatically or logically we have no evidence whatsoever – then we should also accept that the "he" in the second statement also refers to the Qur'an. To accept this however, there should be an explicit verse confirming this view. However, the commentator Ibn Juzayy does not mention the possibility of the Qur'an being the "him" referred to, and Ibn Juzayy transmitted the views of all the major commentators in his work.<br>  <br>  Allah tells about the death of Jesus (pbuh) in one verse in The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 19 as follows: ('Isa said,) Peace be upon me the day I was born, and the day I die and the day I am raised up again alive. (The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 19, Verse 33) <br>  <br>  When we consider this verse together with The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 3, Verse 55, it indicates a very important truth. In the verse in The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 3, it is stated that Jesus (pbuh) was raised up to the presence of Allah. No information is given in this verse about death or killing. Yet in The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 19, Verse 33 information is given about the day when Jesus (pbuh) will die. That death can only be possible if Jesus (pbuh) dies after returning to and living on earth. Only Allah knows for certain.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	What Jesus really said to the thief next to Him on the cross was:<br>  "Verily I say unto thee today,  thou shalt be with me in paradise." [Luke 23:43]<br>  <br>  If you think that you will have to wait after you die to see Jesus, <br>  You are RIGHT !<br>  <br>  You will have to wait for either of the two resurrections, -<br>  <br>  "And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." [John 5:29]<br>  <br>  Jesus resurrection is not counted as one of the two resurrections coming !<br>  <br>  "The Raptor" ?  - what is that ?<br>  Oh you mean the rapture (the Second Coming of Jesus) when He returns<br>  for His people.<br>  <br>  Jesus is NOT a liar.<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|uFAoq4idaa	That was the resurrection during the first coming of Jesus. He promised that He will come again to execute His final judgment. The white throne judgment when He will separate the just from the unjust. He will judge the rest of the dead and together with Him will be those who had been Rapture. They will be judges with Jesus Christ. Rev. 20:4-6 I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I  saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony for Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his image and had nor received his mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reign with Christ a thousand years. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended). This is the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years. The first resurrection will be happening during the Second Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and He will give us our rewards.

Buddhists are fairly tolerant, or at least the ones that I've met. But for a homosexual couple I would suggest a Unitarian church. Unitarian churches encompass a wide range of religions, are incredibly tolerant, and it is there that you will most likely find your true faith or at least become more at peace (spiritually). But remember that whichever religion that you feel is best for you- follow it.

Now how could that possibly be?    God bless you.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Does God exist?  Theologians, philosophers, scientists, and atheists have debated the existence of God for hundreds of years.  Theologians affirm His existence, even though they debate about who He really is.  Philosophers ponder the ability of knowing God and if He exists at all.  Scientists don't find Him under a microscope or on a scale.  So they largely ignore and often define Him out of existence.  Atheists, of course, deny Him and many of them try to prove He does not exist.        Yet, God exists.      He does not exist because we say He does; He is independent of our proclamations.  He does not exist because we want Him to exist; He is independent of our desires.  He does not exist because in our ignorance, we insert God in order to explain the unknown; He is independent of our ignorance.  No.  God exists because He is.  We Christians have experienced Him, felt Him, and know Him.  We can see His hand in our lives.  We see the circumstances of life move and be moved to bring us to answers that we know are from Him.  We sense Him our prayers and our lives.  We see Him work in the lives of others.  We watch as He answers prayer and confirms in our own hearts His love for us.  We know He exists because He exists.       The Bible speaks of God and does not defend His existence.  It simply asserts it.  Sometimes there are simply things you cannot prove to someone else, but you know.  Yes, this is subjective, but it is often true.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	"God" can only be known by personal experience; it can't be transferred to others. Religions are man-made systems to explain and systematize these personal experiences, in order to transfer some understanding to others, and therefore, are all different based on the disparate individual experiences of those who create and follow them. As man-made institutions, they are subject to corruption and manipulation by selfish individuals.|`|93galWG1aa	God has let those who believe in him know him,he gave us a ground rule for mercy and justice to follow, he came into the world to save it from sin, he started one church that church is now called Catholic and it has followed the same teaching since Christ.  The others started by men who thought they could discern the scriptures better and since they couldn't we now have 39000 denominations all teaching slightly different things, but all are against the catholic church because all are not catholic with truth and apostolic tradition handed down from the time of Christ.  One church one faith all else is counterfeit.|`|cByRtCC9aa	Not necessarily. It is possible that all ideas of god are ultimately symbols of God.    IMO, God would speak to you in symbols you can understand. Truth must be accepted eventually and sometimes in order to accept truth, we must be lead along with small steps we can handle.    So for me, an atheist is just as important as someone that shares my views. We're all on the same journey, it's just our paths that differ.|`|vMKheLvLaa	They're not, they thrive for a world better than the one they currently occupy, and that's where religion comes into play.

It depends upon the potential of your mind to understand it. Perhaps you've heard of the elephant as interpreted by six blindfolded men - they described it differently depending on the part of body they touched. And they all disagreed with the others' description.  Hope that explains why everyone doesn't follow the same religion even while admitting that God is one.    As for your original question, a creation by definition requires a creator. God may be nothing like our limited minds imagine Him. But a superior power/force/energy/being is surely there, and we are nothing more than an ant on a basketball, as they say -  unaware of the whole world beyond.

God is far from being like [Santa].     You don't believe in Him because He hasn't called you. When He called me, I wasn't going to church, no one was talking to me about Him, I wasn't watching [any] Christian television about Him, nor did I even own a Bible. I felt a tugging at my soul to give my heart & soul to Him. I ran out [that day] bought a Bible and that night gave my heart to Him.     I see God all around me, everyday. He saved my life. And He's been saving my husbands life every day as well. He's a police officer, and yes, he's been in shoot outs where he should have been killed, but he's still here without a mark on him. Thanks to God. My husband gave his heart to God the day after I did.     No one in here can convince you that God exist. The only one who can is God, when and [if] He should ever choose to call you.

If you look into christianity there is archealogical proof that some of the stories in the Bible is true.  The Bible is the only book and the only religion that has a savior that sacrificed for His people before He asked anything of us.   It shows true salvation.   The Bible is the only book that is not man made even though man has written it through the spirit of God and translated it. To think that God doesn't exist is hard to believe in the perspective of miracles and God showing His existance through nature and answering prayers.  The Bible has prophecies in the whole book that have come true and still have yet to come to pass in these days.   The book was written over 2,000 years ago.    Some of the end time prophecies in the Bible have been predicted by others in the past but they have not contained the detail or the relavance that the Bible predicts. Not all of the bible prophecies have been predicted by others and are only still disclosed in the Bible.     If you look into other religions, their beliefs are not of a savior saving them without good works.   Their God has not sacrificed for them, they must sacrifice themselves first.  There is no proof that these other Gods do exist through miracles, answered prayers or archeological means.  Their "bible" constantly changes context.   They add and take away from the book for their benefit and as they feel their needs fit.   They pray to a God that has no signs of proof or existance.  The other religions ask for a sacrifice from the believer and don't offer a sarifice to save their believer from troubles.   You can hear about a christian praying for protection and they will testify that God answered their prayer and saved them, but do buddists or other religions give testimony on how their God has saved them from despairs or blessed them through their faith or good works?   Christians can feel the presence of God and when God works in someones life you know it is Him that is answering your prayers and is present with you.  He works where no man can.   He reveals himself through circumstances for us to show that He is there when there is no other way possible for man or any other power to fix the situation.   That shows that God does exist.   Dr. tells you that you have cancer and you ask God for healing and go back and the Dr. tells you the cancer is gone, aren't you going to wonder where the cancer went?  Can you just believe that it went away on its own or that the Dr made a mistake knowing that you seen xray of the tumor yourself?    If you look into other religions how many are being saved or healed by their God? How many good works to they have to do for their God before He will talk to them, send them a sign or heal them?  God doesn't ask for anything from us other than to believe and have faith in Him and try to live a righteous life.   He made the sacrifices for us to make that happen and He blesses those that believe without asking for good works, or for us to make the actual sacrifice ourselves.  He made the sacrifice and He has shown His existance and truth through His works.   All I have to do is believe and live as He asks for me to do and He will continue to show me that He is there and that He will help and answer my prayers.   It is walking by faith and not by sight, believing in the unseen and unknown.  There is not religion that has a belief system to where there God appears in physical realm to man other than Jesus.  Jesus will appear in the physical realm to man again when God's timing is right for the second coming.

wY8jE8HEaa	No one.<br>  <br>  Prophet Lot managed to escort the messengers to the safety of his home; however, Lot’s wife slipped out the back door and quickly told the people that two beautiful men were guests in Lot’s home.  The word quickly spread and soon people were outside Lot’s house, knocking on his door, demanding to see the guests.  Lot became even more distressed when he realised his wife was responsible for the crowd at his door and he pleaded with the mob to disband and to fear the punishment of God.  He repeatedly appealed to them to seek sexual gratification in a lawful way. <br>  <br>  “O my people!  Here are my daughters (i.e. the daughters of my nation); they are purer for you (if you marry them lawfully).  So fear God and degrade me not as regards my guests!  Is there not among you a single right-minded man?” (Quran 11:78)<br>  <br>  The story of Lot, in both the Bible and the Quran hold remarkable similarities.  However, Islam completely rejects the notion that Prophet Lot would offer his own daughters to the town’s people.  The scholars of Islam explain that when Lot used the word daughters he meant the women of Sodom.  He was demanding that the men of Sodom seek sexual fulfilment in lawful marriages.<br>  <br>  In his book Stories of the Prophets, Ibn Katheer states that the town’s people broke down the door and rushed inside Lot’s house, surrounding the messengers.  Lot was powerless before them yet he continued to plead and remind them of the evil of their ways.  The town’s people jeered and mocked him saying, “Surely you know that we have neither any desire nor in need of your daughters, and indeed you know well what we want!” (Quran 11:79).  The messengers reassured Lot by saying “surely we are messengers from your Lord.” (Quran 11:81)  On hearing these words the towns people were afraid and started to disperse, leaving Lot  and his family alone with the messengers (angels).<br>  <br>  The messengers allayed the fears of Prophet Lot and instructed him to gather his family and leave the town of Sodom that night.  Lot walked at the rear of his family to assure no one looked back on the towns of Sodom.  Lot’s wife remained behind and was afflicted by the punishment along with the wrong doers and wicked townspeople.  Quran describes the punishment as an awful cry that turned the town upside down and rained stones of baked clay.  (Quran 15:73-74)<br>  <br>  The punishment came at sunrise, and God said, <br>  <br>  “So We saved him and his family, all, except an old woman (his wife) among those who remained behind.  Then afterward We destroyed the others.  And We rained on them a rain (of torment).  And how evil was the rain of those who had been warned.  Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers.” (Quran 26:170-174)<br>  <br>  Thus, the pages were closed on the people of Lot.  Their names were erased from historical memory.  The punishment that God promised, and Prophet Lot warned about, happened, for surely God keeps His promises.  He promises severe punishment for the wrongdoers and Paradise is the reward of the righteous.  Lot and his family walked into the sunrise and Quran mentions them no more.|`|UGk26Cxraa	His daughters, knowing that he would not have consensual sex with them, got him drunk, in order that his seed might continue.

This flies in the face of the version concocted by those who promote homophobia.  They claim everyone in the mob was gay.  If this were true, why would Lot offer his daughters?  What mob of gay men bent on rape would be interested in females?

TJortovMaa	I have Bi-Polar.  When I was first diagnosed a lot of my extended family made me feel like if I took medicine I was week.  If I had enough faith and tried hard enough that was all I would need.  The following is part of an article I read that I really enjoyed.  I liked this article because it was written by a leader of my church.  He encourages getting help for these kinds of problems in other articles.  Faith is important, but it cannot substitute for treatment.  I seriously doubt that all the psychological disorders in the world can be described as the devil.  I had a teacher who posited a theory to us in Psychology.  What if some of the Lords treatments of those who had a devil was just fixing a part of their brain and since the writers in the New Testament didn't know how to describe it called it removing devils.  Anyway I hope you like this article. <br>  <br>  For persons struggling with psychological disorders, anchoring their lives in the gospel can provide longed-for peace.<br>  <br>  People of every society and culture, encounter challenges during their lifetime. Included among the variety of possible personal struggles are a wide range of psychological disorders. The causes of these disorders are varied. Chemical imbalance, childhood abuse, and genetics are just a few of the factors that may play a role. However, to someone struggling with one of these disorders, finding the cause may not be nearly as important as finding a solution and learning to cope. Hope and help become critical as confusion, impaired functioning, and fear increase.<br>  <br>  Medical and psychological sciences offer medication and therapy; sometimes both are helpful in establishing a degree of stability in a psychologically uncertain life. Even though medical and psychological answers sometimes may be evasive, hope and relief are also available through faith in the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the teachings of the gospel, and the guidance of the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  “Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world,” the scriptures teach, “which hope cometh of faith [and] maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast." Anchoring one’s life in the gospel provides peace throughout life’s storms and darkness. Jesus Christ taught the people of his time that he was the “light of the world” and that “he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life” (John 8:12). He invited those carrying terrible burdens to “come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” (Matt. 11:28).<br>  <br>  Following is a personal experiences of people struggling with psychological disorders who have found light in the darkness as they have anchored their faith in Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Healing Effects of the Atonement<br>  As a young man serving a mission, I didn’t realize that the wide swings in my enthusiasm and energy were anything out of the ordinary. Now I realize that my actions resulted from my first major episode of an affective disorder named bipolar, frequently called manic depression.<br>  <br>  During the manic phase of the disorder, I felt absolutely wonderful, as if I could accomplish anything. My energy level soared and my mind seemed so clear that I felt in total control of my life and my future. Getting along with people and making friends was easy, even though I sometimes became frustrated with others because I thought they weren’t working “up to speed.” I demanded perfection in everything I did, and my seemingly heightened abilities made me feel like I could do it all without help from anyone.<br>  <br>  After a few months, I cycled into the depression phase of the disorder. My energy and enthusiasm waned as I realized that my goals were unreachable. Feeling sad and hopeless, I lost interest in nearly everything, including food and sleep. I couldn’t concentrate, and I even thought about suicide. I felt totally worthless and isolated from family, friends, and Heavenly Father. Eventually things would come back to normal until the cycle started over again.<br>  <br>  After I came home from my mission, the mood swings continued to interrupt my life. I became extremely distressed. Every time I began a relationship with a young woman or moved toward establishing a career, my mood shifts got in the way. Finally, I felt so suicidal and hopeless that I entered a treatment program. It was here that my symptoms were diagnosed. I learned that medication and therapy would help alleviate my symptoms, but I still had a hard time accepting the fact that this would be a lifelong challenge.<br>  <br>  In therapy, learning to recognize the signs preceding the manic cycle and the depressive cycle of my disorder became my first goal. Then I focused on learning to manage my symptoms. Gratefully, since my therapist and I were both the same religion, the spiritual dimension became part of my treatment. Using the doctrines of the Atonement, we deeply explored Jesus Christ’s role in bearing our burdens and binding up ou|`|ZoPln7vaaa	I don't necessarily say that hey are oppressed by the devil or demons but GOD can heal them for sure... but all we need to do is to Pray for them.... but yes, most of the time its none other then devil who does such things.... however, don't get frustrated..

I personally believe that demonic possession begin by letting the devil into your heart and living such that you do what he would want you to do as if he had control of you body. As to your particular problem, it is possible to overcome without the use of medicine, but it is very hard. The story of John Nash is an example (he was the main character in A Beautiful Mind, a real person mind you.) He gave an interview when that movie had come out in which he said that he "fed himself on a diet of good thoughts" and he was hallucinating people, had relationships with them even. If he can do it you can as well, it just takes tremendous effort and time.|`|WEM5n41Oaa	Yes.  People with psychological disorders are oppressed by the devil.  It's not your fault.  It's not your lack of faith.  It's just that God lets some of us suffer from the oppression of the enemy.  Like Job for example.  Pray to God to help you quit and to take it off your mind.  If that doesn't help you might want to take meds as an aid for your mind.|`|bf2a3cdfd3a1c0386023cef0e5cd4b0faa	It's a psychological disorder... God won't condemn you for having a disorder... I will not condemn you for having a disorder... and no one else should either... because anyone who says that people who have any mental disorder are devil possessed are plain ignorant.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Demonic oppression or chemical imbalance.

4PbjKk7Vaa	These Twelve Imams(as) are,   The absolute authorities of, Allah(swt),   among all the mankind.      --------------------------------------...      They all were from the same Divine Light, out of which The Holy Prophet(pbuh&hf) was created from.   Like The Holy Prophet(pbuh) they all were special personalities in matter of knowledge, forbearance, moral excellence, justice, high moral standards and other intellectual achievements as being the successors of The Holy Prophet(pbuh&hf) and Leaders and Divine Guides for all mankind.   --------------------------------------...  Sadly of all the Twelve Infallible Holy Imams(as), Eleven of them have been murdered, either by the sword or by poisioning.   It has been narrated by The Holy Prophet Mohammad(pbuh&hf). That even the last of the Infallible Holy Twelve Imams(as), the Imam Mehdi Al-Muntader(as) will also be murdered after he had accomplished his divine quest.     By ridding the world of all miseries and injustice. Then he will establish Justice, and human rights to all mankind!    Even The Holy Prophet Mohammad(pbuh&hf), himself wasn't spared, and was poisioned by a Jewish old woman, who he later, unconditionaly freed and forgave.     Soon after The Prophet's(pbuh&hf) death, his beloved daughter the Lady Fatimah Al-Zahra(as) was also killed due to the blow she recived to her chest breaking her ribs, causing her sevear internal bleeding and misscarriage of her unborn baby.         --------------------------------------...|`|e3PWZYsAaa	TLDR    troll|`|vMAEeh66aa	We believe in 14th infallible not 12th .    which expose your Ignorant .|`|pzMsRJsjaa	thnx for the info    we need to help shias and bring them tot he right path before it's to late    they are misguided and need help     btw i starred this q|`|BPFDMFitaa	And is that how you characterize Allah, you have no knowledge of the attributes of Allah....

NBXY35zPaa	Problem is that the more prisons open up, the more taxes we all have to pay to keep these people in there... to keep them fed, bathed, entertained (sort of), and away from the rest of society. With the tight budget we have right now, we're adjusting laws to allow leeway for certain people so that it frees up room in prison. Even rapists must be kept in a certain facility so they don't get murdered by other inmates.|`|f48d10d4bec5b5e25f9894010aed2c69aa	or they can stop throwing pot heads in jail. or they can take care of these inmates by giving them proper care. repeat criminals have mental illnesses and jail is the worst place for them. i think you are oversimplifying the problem 10 fold. so i disagree|`|AA11412526	The US already has the highest prison population per capita in the world.

In fiscal year 2000 the State of Texas (to use one example) had right at 150,000 inmates. Of those, 50,000 were there for new crimes, the other 2/3 for probation/parole violations (i.e. not actual crimes, but violations of the terms of probation or parole which could be nothing worse then missing office meetings).    Of the 50,000 new crimes, 73% were for non-victim drug crimes (i.e. possession).    Kinda paints a different picture, doesn't it?
NeOVXJcXaa	Just do whatever makes you comfortable.<br>  <br>  I have the body of a teenage girl but I identify as male, dress, look, act like a guy, all that.<br>  <br>  But for me it's not about being a guy. It's about being myself.<br>  <br>  So be yourself, and don't worry about what others think (it is NOT worth it).<br>  <br>  Man I hear ya, when it comes to being in public with your rents and then my mom has to go "and this is my DAUGHTER..." ugh. I hate gender nazis.<br>  <br>  I always was a huge tomboy, always extremely butch for a girl... In middle school though I forced the "girl" thing on myself because that's what everyone WANTED me to be, but it wasn't me. Those were the worst years of my life, definitely. When I cut my hair, started binding, started dressing like a guy, I felt a thousand times better. Actually even before I cut my hair but dressed/binded to pass I DID pass on a couple occasions, which was strangely awesome since I had long hair.<br>  But anyway, yeah.. A huge weight was lifted from my shoulders, just with that. It was liberating.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's not wrong at all.

(that's the "T" in LGBT, so yes, you're in the right section!) <br>  Nope, it's not wrong any of the things you're doing. I'm FtM transsexual, or female to male. I have a female body, but a male brain, male brain sex, or gender identity. I dress like a guy, and ask people to call me by a male name I chose. An I wan to take steps to transition my body more male. It's an intersex birth defect. <br>  You could be transsexual, or you could be transgender, and feel male and female, both neither, a third gender, you could feel more male one day, an more female another day, that's all under transgender. It's about being yourself and being comfortable with yourself.

The Second coming will be very soon, at which time He will not come as a gentle babe, nor as one who is beaten and stricken 'for our sins'. He will come as King and Judge, and all humanity will stand to be judged, but alas, there is none righteous, 'no not one, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God'... which is why you and I need a saviour in the first place. <br>  <br>  But there is another prior event that is very very near.(prior to the second coming) This is 'the rapture', which is the taking up of all believers on earth. He will 'descend from Heaven with a shout, and a trumpet call ' ,note He does not touch the earth, We meet Him in the air, and are there with Him for 7 years, during which time the 'Great Tribulation' occurs on earth. At the end of this time, He will return with us His people to put a final end to sin, death and the enemy.<br>  <br>  Countdown began May 14, 1948 when Israel became a Nation. Ezekial, Zechariah, Daniel and Revelation are just some references to these 'signs' that we can discern ( Bible prophesy centers on Israel). The whole Bible , old and new testamants<br>  are written for us to understand and REALIZE that we can choose God, and Life, through our wonderful Lord and redeemer,  <br>  Yeshua Ha Mashiach, Jesus our Messiah. If you are serioously seeking read John 12, the chapter, or the whole book of John if you dare.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	He rose from the dead...he was already here.  So that doesn't count.  When he went up into heaven the Angels asked the disciples why they were standing there staring, and told them that Jesus would return just as they saw him leaving (coming in the clouds).<br>  <br>  So he hasn't come back a 2nd time yet.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  not arguing, I'm pointing out the obvious here:  he didn't leave YET...he laid in the tomb for three days DEAD.  He didn't descend from heaven after he died, because he didn't go up to heaven yet.  He went up after the resurrection.  He has yet to come again for the 2nd time.  There is a part where it says during that time he preached to the souls in prison.  I guess 2nd or 3rd though is all in how you want to look at the technicalities of it, but he is coming again.  I prefer to just call it a second time though.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	the second coming has nothing to do with the resurrection|`|VjmTK6uZaa	Yes we can count.  But the second coming is the rapture.

7i6qj4OXaa	I don't think it's o.k. for either sex.  I understand homosexuality and lesbianism but I think people should just make up their mind.  I'd have been furious if I had ever had a sexual relationship with someone who had had one with their own gender.  I don't believe people are bi-sexual and should just not engage in sexual activity until they have decided what they are.|`|NWopkX4baa	Men get turned on by seeing two women together, and since men control most of the media structures in society, they promote female bisexuality but deny masculine bisexuality because they are afraid of their own feelings of same-sex attraction which challenges their masculinity and patriarchy in society.|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	It's just plain greedy!

But if a man does it he's praised for it!|`|AA12153514	I think you're referring to "why does society only accept bisexuality in women?" - well, this is because some heterosexual men have what they term a "lesbian fantasy" i.e. wanting to be in a lesbian scene as part of the action. Of course they can only take part if the women are bisexual (not lesbian) and hence the "lesbian fantasy" is invalid.|`|PeQ40WcWaa	WOW.    I was going to go easy on you until I read some of your added comments.    How naive and ignorant can one person be? It's 2009 for God's sake.    Firstly, I wouldn't say society love bisexual women. Not even every straight man would want a bisexual girlfriend. And many straight women get freaked out by bisexual women in case the woman is attracted to them.    Bisexuals (ESPECIALLY women) are stigmatised against for being 'promiscous', 'greedy', 'undecided' etc etc etc.     Being bisexual does NOT mean that someone wants 'a bit of everything'. It means that they are NATURALLY attracted to either sex - that gender is not an issue when finding someone attractive. It is the same as you finding men attractive. It's in your nature. People who are truly bisexual have no choice over the matter. A bisexual person can not just pick a gender. They could not fall in love with a woman and then decide to leave it alone and go and find a man instead, because they wanted to stick to one sexuality.     Being bisexual is not about having sex with as many people as possible, or about being greedy. It's about being attracted to a PERSON, regardless of whether they are a man or a woman.     Consider a room of 100 men. You may walk in and find 5 of them attractive.    Now consider a room of 100 men and 100 women. A bisexual person will not necessarily find 10 people attractive. They may only be attracted to one person in that room. You are very ignorant and are making sweeping statements based on absolutely no knowledge of bisexuality...    And finally, bisexual are not sex addicts. Some bisexual people can be sex addicts. Some straight people can be sex addicts. Some gay people can be sex addicts. Bisexuality is not just about HAVING sex - it's about ATTRACTION. And bisexual people can choose to be moral or immoral, just like gay or straight people.    As for society looking down more on bi men, i think it greatly depends what kind of society you live in - and you cannot speak for every person in the world. I personally have no problems with bisexual men whatsoever. They are no different to me than gay or straight people.    You are entitled to your own opinion. It's just a shame that it is such an uneducated one.|`|ApsAIBNWaa	It's okay for both to be bisexual. I wish that everyone was bisexual.

Look back to "ancient" Rome/Greece/England etc... There is documented proof of bisexualism.  The men only had sex with women for procreation but enjoyed other men for everything else.  Sorry but to answer your question it's a sign of the times.. It doesn't bother me either way, I think the world could do with more "True" bi-sexual people.|`|01NUrwfYaa	because society is male dominated one, not for women... and it is barely changing..

I have a gender writing class.|`|5N6FqIfoaa	It's more accepted to be bisexual than to be GAY.    Most "straight" guys make this hate come true. They discriminate anyting different than them, or anything they're scared of because they can't come in terms with it. But of course Gay And Bisexual women are 100% fine to them cause it's "hot".      :)|`|CfZn9kK5aa	I think it's perfectly OK and natural for both to be bisexual.     As a bisexual woman, I cannot even begin to tell you how many times I've been told that my sexuality does not exist.  ------     It is natural for SOME women to be bisexual. But by far, not ALL women are bisexual.  -------   Buddha   "I don't believe people are bi-sexual and should just not engage in sexual activity until they have decided what they are."     I DO know what I am. I am bisexual. I am sexually attracted to both genders. Sexuality is about attraction, not action. If I never dated a single women in my life, I would be bisexual, not straight. If I never dated a single man in my life, I would be bisexual, not lesbian. Why? Because I am STILL attracted to BOTH genders.     Attraction, not action.       A homosexual man who hides his sexuality and marries a woman, and even has children is STILL homosexual, because he is STILL only attracted to males.  Attraction. Not action.     I know what I want. I am not undecided in any way, shape, or form. I want some one to love me, I want some one to love.  I want some one who loves me for me, who understand who I am, who can look past my flaws and love me any way.  I just do not mind if that person is male, or female, as I find them both very attractive.      Please, tell me... what am I undecided about? What do I need to choose?  --------  Sparkle  " But i just think bisexuals are like sex addicts or something. They want some of everything and i think thats gross"     In my long life, I have had sex with 5 people. And I was committed and in a serious relationship with each of them.      I do not have sex any more than the average person, my sex drive is not heightened, and I do not want some of every thing, I just want to be loved.      What is gross about being attracted to people? It is not as though I am running around having sex with every thing that moves (I'll only have sex with people I am in a serious relationship with, and I never have sex with some one unless I have been dating them more than a year), I am not seeking any sort of sexual deviance. I don't 'f*ck' my partner, I make love to my partner. Because I love my partner.     What is gross about me liking both men and women?  What is gross about me finding both attractive? How is attraction gross?    "But i just think bisexuals are like sex addicts or something."     How can you make such outlandish comments about me, with out even knowing me. With out ever speaking to me?     I am NOT a sex addict.  ---  Firebird      The millions upon millions upon millions of homosexual and heterosexual women disagree with you.       Yup.

TEtOq1XCaa	The fact that dinosaurs and man coexisted is not a silly idea. It is historically recorded in God's word (dinosaurs were created on day 6 with man), and God gave them green plants for food (i.e. they did not eat meat at least until after sin). This is also evidenced later in the bible where God describes to Job two dinosaurs, and there is plenty of extra-biblical evidence supporting the fact that man and dinosaurs coexisted (relatively recent historical accounts of dinosaurs, cave paintings of dinosaurs etc.) Note that the scientific evidence proves fossils can form in less than 100 years - no such evidence has been gathered over millions of years. Empirical proof is on the side of Christians for the formation of the fossil record.<br>  <br>  The silly idea is that despite all this evidence, dinosaurs and man did not coexist. This religious evolutionary belief requires more faith than I could ever hope to muster.<br>  <br>  Edit: "Dinosaur fossils are never found in the same stratigraphic layer as humans, so that means either they did not exist at the same time, or somehow the bones got sorted after being buried in the Earth's crust."<br>  Just thought I would comment on Zargon's statement. He believes that "stratigraphic layer" has a bearing on timescale, consistent with his evolutionary thinking. Christians, however, believe that much of the fossil record was due to Noah's flood (not formed over millions of years), so whether fossils are found together in the fossil record or not has no bearing on whether the lifeforms lived together. In other words, Zargon's argument is circular and irrelevant, unless you already believe in evolution.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	man and animals existed together as well as dinosaurs<br>  <br>  meat eaters did not start until after the flood<br>  <br>  this temple shows dinosaur carving.

During the process of dictating, transcribing, copying, typesetting, and printing, some human errors were made. Soon after the first printing of the Book of Mormon, in 1830, readers began finding typographical, spelling, and other mistakes. The Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery made over 1,000 corrections for the second edition (1837). For the third edition (1840), Joseph Smith made further corrections after careful prophetic review, comparing the original manuscript with the printed text.<br>  <br>  Additional info.<br>   Joseph Smith declared that “the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, . . . and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than any other book” (History of the Church, 4:461). The appropriate sense of correct as used by Joseph Smith in this statement would be, “Set right, or made straight. Hence, right; conformable to truth” (Noah Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language [1828]). Every edition of the Book of Mormon has been instrumental in bringing people to a knowledge of the truth by the power of the Holy Ghost (see Moroni 10:3–5).<br>  <br>  Examples of the types of corrections or changes made in early editions of the Book of Mormon (excluding punctuation) are shown in the table below. In 1879, with the blessing of the First Presidency, Elder Orson Pratt of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles produced an edition with more chapter divisions and with versification that has continued in all subsequent editions. He also added footnotes and made some changes in spelling and grammar.<br>  <br>  In 1920 President Heber J. Grant assigned a committee headed by Elder James E. Talmage of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to create a new edition that would correct a few errors made in previous editions. This new edition was formatted in double-column pages, with chapter headings, chronological data, revised footnote references, a pronouncing guide, and an index. Punctuation and capitalization were also revised.<br>  <br>  The current edition (1981) includes extensive cross references, footnotes, and other study aids. References shown in the table below are from the current edition and are given for convenience in locating the passages referred to. <br>  <br>  To see the table, go to the link :)<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Joseph Smith wasn't the scribe, he translated it while other people wrote.|`|zQyslfHKaa	same reason the bible has similar numbers of changes.|`|Vy8p3Qlcaa	Because its a big book of lies.|`|67EaIAvbaa	because they just don't know...when you see a Mormon,tell them to read Revelation 22:17-21

I may not like seeing a woman wearing practically nothing, but it is her choice, not mine.|`|d5hCUGnjaa	wel uk n america doesnt see a problem with it, mayb they like it like that! i dont know but it is true what u say|`|sNu6SiINaa	It's funny how the western world labled Islam as degrading to women. but a women shaking her @ss in a thong and men looking at her like she is a peice of meat is not?|`|MYN4VFJvaa	to ALL IGNORANT PEOPLE OUT HERE - muslim women ARE NOT opresssed when they wear the hijab. it's a command from God in the Quran and NOT MEN DICTATING US WHAT TO WEAR. it's true some men force their daughters/wives to wear hijab, but you cant generalize. Hijab liberates women!!!    koushesh: yeah right. go and google up rape,sexual assault, and other crimes commited against women in the west and try comparing them to the stats inthe Islamic world.    smile:) it's NOT extreme. a lot of women cover their faces out of their own choice. the wives of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) covered themselves completely as it was ordered for them to do so in the Quran. a lot of muslim women emulate them in their way of dressing. what's wrong with that? besides some say it's obligatory to cover your face, some say it's not. to each his own. but the hijab (covering of hair) is obligatory.      smile:)  "Mid East. (i.e. Islamic countries) predominantly all women wear the hijab. If you don't; they look at you funny."     'middle east' is a very broad term. there are many Islamic and Arab countries. you cant clamp them all down under one category.     "So, all those people looking at the non-hijab people still have their eyes fixed on Allah, when they judge others on the account that they are not wearing a hijab..? What's is it to them..? It's between the individual and their god"    that's  a good point. yes, people should stop judging for its not for us to judge. but advice is a part of Islam. when someone advices you, it's not like they are judging.    smile:) just b/c the questioner doesnt wear hijab doesnt mean it's not obligatory. just like a lot of christians having pre-marital sex doesnt mean the bible permits it :) dont judge a religion by their followers, but by their holy book.      koushesh: and do you know even men are sentenced to death for the same 'immoral crimes' ?    kiushesh: before you leave, why dont you write down the proof confirming your  (false and ridiculous) *claims*?   and the Bible doesnt ask women to "learn in submission"?   the testimony of women in Islam is NOT always half that of man. in some cases a woman's testimony can nullify a man's testimony.    smile:) i cant debate w/ you on YA lol. you can contact me if you like to discuss this further :    maria_slater88@yahoo.com      juve girl : it's more complicated than that. the whole requiring a witness thing in rape in Islam is too distorted.      edir: smile: if someone's driving a PERFECT car w/o any problems but causes an accident midway, do you blame him or the car for it?    juve girl: lol i will but not on here. its a bit too late in my part of the world. pls contact me :)|`|1ZVtTII8aa	I completely agree with you.    @ troll in disguise-It may be obligatory to wear Hijab in Islam but that doesn't tie you down, a woman can easily take off a hijab whenever she pleases, (though obviously they'd be going against Islam!) it's not glued to her head!    edit: I gave ziggy a thumbs up by accident, I meant for it to be a down!!  lol|`|w9hzZSiNaa	I agree with you but I can tell you that wearing a hijab doesn't exclude one from this. I know many modest muslimahs who don't wear hijab and many hijabis that are very immodest in the clothes they wear. I think it's all about intention.... I personally think it's worse to wear a hijab and be imodest than to not wear one and be immodest because it gives hijabis bad reputations if you know what I mean...    in the west, religion is not nearly as important to the majority of people as it is in the middle east. That's just a fact and shown through western culture and the way some women around here walk around.     Like I said, religion plays different roles in the west and it seems to me much more personal.....I know people who seem ashamed to be religious and that makesd me very sad. One wonderful thing about muslims is that they're SO proud to be muslim and I wish the rest of the world would have some dignity in themselves....maybe then we wouldn't be succombing ourselves to supermodels and bikinis....|`|zBqt99avaa	You know, sometimes I think these ads go too far.  I really don't want to see so much of anyone's flesh while on the subway, for example.    However, it is interesting to note, that for the most part, women in the west are not treated in a depreciating manner, at least in polite society.  If you frequent nightclubs, someone is going to say something.  But going to work or shopping, etc., it isn't North American men who stare and act crazy...    Honestly, you girls are sound oblivious as to the workings of a male mind.  Men will still look.  No one looks at anyone and thinks about their intelligence first off.  Not you, not me.  Something gets your attention first, or you wouldn't care if they were smart or not.    Yes, music videos are beyond disgusting (generally) and should have much stricter regulations.  I haven't watched them in about 10 years, because they promote a manner of thinking that I think unhealthy for people who want to live decent lives.  But music videos are not an accurate representation for how women are treated in the west any more than Fox News shows accurate representations of the middle east.    EDIT:  The comment about rape/sexual assault east v. west is ridiculous in the extreme.  A woman can't prove rape on her word alone in the east.  She needs witnesses.  What kind of a man will testify that he saw a woman get raped, but did not help her?  None.  In the west, my word is all it takes.  This is the reason rape charges are fewer in the east.    Seriously, learn something about psychology.  Rape has NOTHING to do with sexual arousal.  It is about CONTROL.  The man wants to dominate a woman, and does so in a manner that he finds gratifying.  It wouldn't matter to a rapist if the woman was in a burka' or a bikini.    Believer:  Then for the love of God, please explain, because I've never heard this before, and believe me, I've been asking.    EDIT:  Bridgette, come on....!  Do you know any western women personally?  Where do you live?  Teenage girls have self esteem issues everywhere, but *most* adult women are just fine with themselves.|`|UpIjgNV5aa	The opinions on what is modest what isn't varies. You'll be surprised for you it might be immodest not for them. Everyone has different opinions. There was a program on TV where girls were dying to become a Glamor Model, so it is subjective.     Just b/c you wear a Hijab does not make you superior to others in anyways and not the best attitude to put your point across. You do know men are used as well??|`|AA12071655	You should perhaps refrain from attempting to use your own culture's morals and ethics to explain that of another.|`|0yTM98Odaa	Because of the freedom in the west and not all western people dress like that, I don't!  And I certainly don't feel degraded or degrade myself.|`|AYs6iFlLaa	They call it FREEDOM, i call it SICK! it is disgusting to see women treated as whores and it even more disgusting that is it readily accepted. It even saddens me because I know many women who believe that thier worth is in the way they appear to men. American women have the most issues with low self esteem.|`|4INE794zaa	As a "western" woman, from Canada, I must respectfully disagree. I don't dress immodestly, or modestly, but a happy medium of both. I am not looking for respect from men, or women, based on how I dress, or what I look like. But my actions, personality and intelligence always get the respect that they deserve.   Frankly, if a man chooses to look at my cleavage instead of my face while I am instructing him, so be it. It only speaks as to his intelligence and the level of respect he deserves from me. I dole out respect based on personal merit, and a man only interested in ogling my goods, deserves none from me. I do not feel degraded, nor does diminish my self worth. I cannot control what is in the heart and mind of others, nor would I want that kind of power.   I also feel very strongly that my face and body are a big part of who I am. They are distinguishing and original only to me. They make me beautiful, even if I do not fit the hollywood image of beauty, and I do not wish to hide it. I enjoy being free to allow my individual beauty onto the world. Just my thoughts.|`|ILc1XIPraa	I know .. They have it twisted., I've lived both lives. HIjab is the most uplifting thing for a women if she only knew.|`|pNww5UC0aa	It's called marketing. Advertising agencies do whatever it takes to sell their products.    Hijab: Most uplifting thing...? o_O. I'd rather serve my God in an unseen motion. I can still wear modest clothes without wearing a hijab. A hijab to me is like 'Look at me'. It attracts people to look. Well, I sure do. It's difficult to miss.    a believer: Explain to me why other Muslims find it necessary to cover their face too. That's beyond modesty. Perhaps, extremism, per se. That's not following what Allah says.    Also, leading on to what the troll in disguise said, Mid East. (i.e. Islamic countries) predominantly all women wear the hijab. If you don't; they look at you funny. So, all those people looking at the non-hijab people still have their eyes fixed on Allah, when they judge others on the account that they are not wearing a hijab..? What's is it to them..? It's between the individual and their god.    Also, the hypocrasy. My friend's father owns a restaurant. He was told he was not allowed to tend to the Muslim women party because of their dress-wear. My friend tended to them, instead. And they were wearing inappropriate clothing for Allah's standards. So basically, behind closed doors they wear what they want. Superficial. o_O.    Obligatory...? Then why did the questioner just say that she doesn't wear a hijab, but, dresses modestly?    The purpose of dressing young children in a hijab. Are they really that ready to make a solid commitment to serve their God? I wasn't ready at that age. I may have prayed to Him and read picture Bibles, but I never made a commitment to follow Him alone etc.    'middle east' is a very broad term. there are many Islamic and Arab countries. you cant clamp them all down under one category.   ^^ Okay. :)    just b/c the questioner doesnt wear hijab doesnt mean it's not obligatory.  ^^ It's quite difficult to comprehend that sentence. Followers represent the Qur'an in action. If they aren't following how are they representing Islam to the rest of the world. Non-believers are always on watch, generally.    Debate...? I'm not debating. I'm giving you facts about reality.    Nothing is perfect, except God. :)|`|Kiv4D2aWaa	Because they've been given equal rights.    They're not forced into anything. They choose to do whatever they do that you find  'shameful'. Who are you blaming? Women in the west are treated far better than they are in Islamic countries.    Edit: Oh, really? It EVEN stopped people from burying girls alive? That's SO much equality I don't mind stoning women to death for 'immoral behaviour'.    Edit: Nah, men's punishment is different. They're buried to their waists whereas women are buried to their necks! And if they can dig their way out, they're forgiven.  ;) You can't win this. Even technicalities are on my side.  Oh, and don't forget the fact that women must be obedient.  And their word in court's worth half that of men.  I could go on, I just don't want to cause any offence.    Edit: Oh, yea? "There must be a good reason" for stripping people of their rights? Then your question is moot. Because "there must be a good reason" for degrading women in the west.

zj8HLXI3aa	I encourage everyone who takes interest in this issue, and other issues of creationism vs. evolutionism (and atheism vs christianity, etc) to read Josh Mcdowell's (underline)The New Evidence That Demands a Verdict (stop underline)<br>  Great book. It's not preaching to the choir, and it's something that I feel atheists would enjoy reading. Raises some great questions.<br>  <br>  Something that I've taken from the book, is the (somewhat) simple idea of logic and proof of god. Atheists believe that since god falls outside of logic and so-far proved theories, that he cannot exist. One must realize a simple truth that logic and reasoning have no span; there is (nearly) no limit to the amount of logic that one can amass. <br>  Proof of god lies within your skin, in the color of eyes, and of the tissue that you are made of. DNA is a message, a text. Simply put, intelligence is found within language and communication. DNA conveys a message through its own language and communication.

All Christianity does is explain something as fact without backing it up. How do you argue with a book that says "this is how it is" and you cant argue against it because it also says "i dont lie". Its like an endless cycle. You should also look up what a theory is in terms of science. Theories are made out of collected facts, a theory doesnt become a fact. Do you know how a scientist gets attention? By disproving theories that already exist not by proving them right. To this day there has not been a single thing to disprove the evolution theory and all the so-called evidence against it is just holes in the theory that hasnt been proven yet. This doesnt mean that they wont be.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Because there is no evidence FOR the intelligent design. Thats like me saying i have a secret passage to china that i can only use when people arent around or it wont work then saying "well you cant prove me wrong".

At least it has some evidence, religion has too many holes in the story of creation. The scientific mind cant phatom religion jusy as the religious mind can't phatom science.<br>  Maybe it's just because the science is so complex, but the religion, not saying any of the theories are wrong, it;s just too hard to believe in. too many "holes" if you will. <br>  <br>  But, just like creation, evolution is just a theory. <br>  Gravity is also only a theory.<br>  So there's about as much security in the fact that there's a god or that the big bang happened as there is in the security of what's keeping you on the ground.|`|sw08ARSZaa	You're wrong.

I don't think there's anything wrong with black history month, but it does raise the question: Why can't whites have a white history month? <br>  <br>  We tend to revere both whites and blacks in different ways. For instance, museums, books, and movies are created to honor both races. It doesn't necessarily have to be holidays. Besides, what's wrong with having a month dedicated to the achievements of a race that has been wrongly enslaved for past centuries?|`|uBNX4Cg7aa	As someone who says that exact same thing, I think I can relate to this.<br>  <br>  No, it's not racist at all. I personally disagree with the whole idea of black history month. It's not that I don't want people to learn about historical black figures, it's that it really is not about history, it's about politics. It's sort of the same thing as affirmative action, in that the federal government is using its time and resources on a racial holiday. <br>  <br>  And then the content of most of the Black History Month presentations and speeches is very politically correct and left wing. It focuses a lot on how white people enslaved black people (a terrible thing, but not as terrible as they would lead you to believe. And if it weren't for that there would be almost no black people in America today - just think of that). <br>  <br>  Then there's the fact that there IS no "white history month".

When the sun started to come up, we realized that it was time to call it a night (or day) and made plans to see each other again. We dated for a few months afterwards and he moved in with me 5 months later.|`|AA12006309	Last June-slash-July, online.|`|nisfxpXHaa	14 years ago. <br>  <br>  Became a real couple 12 years ago.<br>  <br>  <br>  L|`|Bk09TO3vaa	I met mine at work about 4 years ago.
1wNsBNmxaa	According to the best-known versions of the twins' story, they were born to Leda after she was seduced by Zeus, or were the sons of her mortal husband Tyndareus, the king of Lacedaemon. Other versions have the twins being hatched from an egg, like their sister Helen. They were both excellent horsemen and hunters who participated in the hunting of the Calydonian Boar and later joined the crew of Jason's ship, the Argo. During the expedition of the Argonauts, Pollux took part in a boxing contest and defeated King Amycus of the Bebryces, a savage mythical people in Bithynia. After returning from the voyage, the Dioskouroi helped Jason and Peleus to destroy the city of Iolcus in revenge for the treachery of its king Pelias.<br>  <br>  When their sister Helen was abducted by the legendary Greek king Theseus, they invaded his kingdom of Attica to rescue her, abducting Theseus' mother Aethra in revenge and carrying her off to Sparta while setting a rival, Menestheus, on the throne of Athens. Aethra was forced to become Helen's slave but was eventually returned to her home by her grandsons Demophon and Acamas following the fall of Troy.<br>  <br>  Castor and Pollux aspired to marry the Leucippides, Phoebe and Hilaeira, the daughters of their uncle Leucippus. Although both women were already betrothed to Lynceus and Idas, the sons of Aphareus, the twins carried them both off to Sparta where Phoebe bore Mnesileos to Pollux and Hilaeira bore Anogon to Castor. This began a feud between the four cousins. They carried out a cattle-raid in Arcadia together but fell out over the division of the meat, prompting the Dioskouroi to seize all the cattle and drive them back to Sparta, pursued by Lynceus and Idas. Castor was ambushed by Idas and fatally wounded by a blow from his cousin's spear, but Idas was himself killed by a thunderbolt hurled in revenge by Zeus while Lynceus was killed by Pollux.<br>  <br>  Returning to the dying Castor, Pollux was given the choice by Zeus of spending all his time on Mount Olympus or giving half his immortality to his mortal brother. He opted for the latter, enabling the twins to alternate between Olympus and Hades.The brothers became part of the stellar constellation Gemini ("the twins"), becoming the two brightest stars in the group: Castor (Alpha Geminorum) and Pollux (Beta Geminorum).<br>  <br>  <br>  D?mon~~?

No one should ever believe ANYTHING based upon emotions or comfort or feelings.  Nothing, and certainly not something as urgently important as the existence of God.  God made sure we would have plenty of evidence for his existence.  I am a logical Christian - the evidence of His existence and love is overwhelming.|`|2zYCQX9saa	Yes, very perceptive! <br>  <br>  We all live alone in our own world of experience.

It is possible for someone to be so enthusiastic  about the experience they are having that others can get swept along to follow them.<br>  <br>  Buddha did not claim to be god, but he so eloquently voiced his claim of having found a way to inner peace that many believed in his experience. However, they could never have Buddha's experience, they had to have one of their own.<br>  <br>  The same is true in Christianity. Everyone must be convinced in their own experiences of God. Therefore ALL faith rests upon subjective experience.

Try going to Myheritage.com<br>  You can enter the information you have, and create a family tree. They also have resources to help you trace down more info. They will try to match the names in your tree with other people's families.

9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	I don't think its absolutely necessary for someone to be exposed to different cultures.  If they want that exposure, that's great, but I don't look down on those who are already comfortable with their own.<br>  <br>  I only have a problem with people being against a race or culture that they not experienced and know nothing about.  In my experience, people who have had more quality experiences and learned education with different cultures are much less likely to be racist or ethnocentric.  They take a thoughtful approach to understanding others which breaks down the pillars of bigotry.<br>  <br>  So, I think quality is more important.  For some people, the only exposure they have to blacks (which is a term I use simply to be concise) is through music videos, sitcoms and biased media outlets like Fox News.  They may watch a great quanity of such stuff, but they would be mistaken to think it wholly represents black culture.  If people want to understand black culture, they should make black friends and research about black culture in a historical context.  College is great place to do that.  For me, going to college with people of many different cultures debunked many of my previously held stereotypes and taught me that, in essence, people are just people.

My husband and I soon discovered I was pregnant.  As a result of the pregnancy we discovered I have HIV.  My husband and I were not planning on having children for several more year (about 4 or 5).  By then, it probably would have been too late for much to happen.  If it were not for my son we never would have known.  God gave me my little angel to give me the knowledge of the HIV.  Then, there was more good news, I have a clean virus, my body is keeping the virus under control without the use of medication, I have no other illnesses and after 5 years of unprotected sex, my husband is still negative!      I have had so many miracles happen in my life, my mom and I were involved in a car accident that should have killed us.  I came out with minor injuries and my mom came out with some damage to her ankle (it had to be fused).      Another one?  My mom got really sick one night while my dad was out.  When my dad got back he called 911.  In the emergency room the doctors told us we were lucky we called when she did.  My mom's Temperature was so high it could have killed her.      Then, you want to know the best one of all?  The first time your baby smiles at you.  The first time he giggles, squeals and begins to talk.  Miracles are not always this big things that change the whole world, it is the simple things that effect your life or your families life.  A miracle could be something as simple as a doe just getting missed by a speeding car so she can make it back to take care of her fawn.  It can be the mother who thought her child was dead only to find that the doctors were able to save her baby.  For me, everyday is a miracle.  Because every day I am alive means one more day HIV has not taken from me.  It means one more day I get to spend with my husband, my baby and our families.  It means one more day I get to live.|`|bCp9wZgSaa	Miracles do happen.

Ao52XHjCaa	Chances are you aren't going to turn into a social butterfly soon. You seem to genuinely like people and are capable of making friends, so I wouldn't worry about it. (You aren't a sociopath, so I'm going to let the sniper comment go). In addition to everything else, our culture places a high value on being extroverted and participating in groups, so the introverts come to think there is something wrong with their personalities.  I'm an introvert and take a great deal of satisfaction just observing people. (Which generally creeps people out *sighs*). Lots of forced chat exhausts me, but I do have plenty of friends.<br>  <br>  P.S. Of course I'm not wanted everywhere.<br>  <br>  (Somewhere in your future, you are going to be forced to take an MBTI and go to a Dale Carnegie Course and you'll learn to manage around that loner and come into your own.)|`|bbWzitisaa	when the opportunity arises, don't fail to pass it up. i have done it often, but realized that nothing good will come of it. the only way to be more sociable is to put yourself out there and actually talk. next time you are sitting down somewhere, start to talk to the person next to them. maybe comment on the area, to start off. i do it, and most people don't mind.|`|br9l9yiqaa	I never really interacted with a lot of people either...<br>  I had a few select friends and that was it.<br>  <br>  But sometimes, every now and then take people up on their offer.

Which is fine, the world needs introverts. However it also sounds like you slightly want to open up and be more social. Just start off slow. I am similar to what you described, except I AM a people person, I'm just shy most of the time. But I've pushed my self to talk more and be more open and in the long run it's made me feel a lot better. Yeah the random conversations I have with people I barely know aren't always necessary or extremely beneficial, but it has definitely helped my self esteem and allowed me to meet new people.|`|YlMR42agaa	Stop being shy!!!!!!!!!! it's OK to spark up a convo don't think there going to not like what you say.

That's just who you are. It is your personality. <br>  <br>  Just today, I was at the dining hall and literally freaked out because there were so many people and I was afraid I wasn't going to get a seat. I actually swiped my meal card (so it was paid for) and ALMOST left when I saw all those people. I did get a table but even though I did get a seat, I was very anxious. I ate really quickly just to avoid someone sitting with me. (There were that many people.) I couldn't even enjoy my food because I ate it so fast. I get nervous around people so, I just finished quick and left. I didn't want anyone to come into contact with me. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, that's who I am. I've always been like that. No matter how hard I try, I can't change that, and i wish i could.|`|4HClQObFaa	Have you ever thought why it is that most straights think whether you are gay or not is a choice?<br>  <br>  That's because in most other social situations you DO have a choice. If you want to be a sociable friendly person who finds it easy to make friends you must just do it.<br>  <br>  When someone speaks to you try to talk to them as much as they talk to you.<br>  <br>  When someone talks to you across the room, go over and say hi and talk about whatever they wanted when they called you.<br>  <br>  If you go out of your way to give them good value they will get used to it and you will be approached more and more.<br>  <br>  And in the same way as you always give us hugs you will be giving the people you talk to strokes and they will feel you are interested and willing to join in.<br>  <br>  And they will be glad of it just we are glad of the hugs.<br>  <br>  And if you do it right when you want someone to talk to there will always be someone you know well enough about the place.<br>  <br>  Go try it!
LS3KHhIRaa	It is very simple, they need you to believe to make their believe system feel correct.

Therefore when Christians go out into the world and attempt to make disciples of all nations, they're following directions of their Lord. Blame them for being faithful to their calling--not to inventing the idea in the first place.<br>  <br>  Secondly, if they believe non-Christians are going to Hell if they don't believe, then wouldn't it be the loving thing to do to warn non-Christians of their fate?<br>  <br>  Third, faith is a decision each person makes. Therefore, the role of a Christian should not be to "pressure" you to convert. They're to pray for you, inform you, care for you, love you. However, conversion is up to you. God and His people won't force you to convert.|`|PS6Pjtndaa	Christians are like everyone else from every other walk of life.  What?  No atheists push a little too hard about stuff they believe in?

I haven't witnessed to anyone, let alone pressured them.<br>  <br>  Some Christians are just a little too eager, that's all.  But REMEMBER ... smokers who quit can be mighty annoying too.

Say you're a tourist going through the Amazon rainforest. You decide that you do not want a tour guide to lead you through some of it, and that you want to explore it yourself. You set out on your hike, and you walk along a path of your choosing. However, the tourguide knows that there is a pool of quicksand up ahead, so he warns all of his tourists that he is leading to catch up to you and warn you to follow the tour guide in order to remain safe. You either refuse to listen to the warnings and end up in the quicksand, or you choose to follow the tour guide to safety.<br>  <br>  That's how it is with Christianity. God is the tour guide. He knows what to expect in this life. We Christians are the tourists who choose to follow the tour guide, and the rest of you are the tourists who like to go your own way. Eventually you will be led to the "quick sand".<br>  <br>  HEY IT'S A GOOD ANALOGY!|`|UkKEvilYaa	Why do you throw a life jacket to a drowning person? Because you love them and want them to live.

6rOZc0P8aa	If homosexuality is so "normal" to accept then why do over 30% of homosexuals get that way though forced experience in jail and then liking it and continuing the "learned" lifestyle when they get out. Why is it also learned through childhood molestation and sexual abuse. Molesters in great numbers go on to become molester themselves. I agree that genes also plays a role in many cases also. But I homosexuals are very good tippers in restaurants and very intellectual as a group. Very complex subject you brought up. A dead end you say? It is a malfunction of genetics. We are chemically engineered to be attracted to the opposite sex. Compulsions and fetishes are different in everybody and ones likes or dislikes which trigger the brains pleasure centers also play a role in homosexuality.|`|8Vz9JF7paa	hahaha freddy good answer!<br>  <br>  I agree apart from the fact that the majority of the planet are not gay and we are already over populated atm. Plus technology these days allows gays to have children together just like people who are infertile... THAT'S evolution! bring on technology!!!! wooop|`|mGfCY4Ytaa	not with today's technology :) i geet where you are coming from though. I kinda think that homosexuality is way of checking the overpopulation situation, but thats just my theory.|`|PZODV3QQaa	Nope because gay men have married women to be accepted into society for ages and other non gay people can carry the jean|`|aW5uShwtaa	No because only 11% of the population is gay.|`|tb67ss8Naa	far from|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Not if you have an understanding of genetics. It simply doesn't work the way you're thinking.|`|d8ox561maa	Smart-@ss|`|v4qLlGGhaa	There are plenty of people who are infertile. How do you explain them?<br>  <br>  Most people are bisexual but end up choosing one side because of society. If 10% are homosexual then only about 10% are truly heterosexual. This explains why, in Leviticus, the men were forced to choose women in order to produce more offspring.|`|dkoGI9nfaa	No it won't.  There are still a very large part of the population who choose to procreate and thus ensure the continuation of the species.  SOme of those people born are going to be gay just as those who are gay today were created by straight people.|`|Bk09TO3vaa	NO!<br>  <br>  <br>  We are just the beginning of more great things to come.|`|nJnKSzmzaa	So is poor vision ,,,, but the whole planet ,, isn't blind ...
pBJH34lYaa	good one dude , so true and ive tried to say it with long answers,,, youve done it with a simple question,,,cheers|`|N73oZyY8aa	Well, it takes a man and a woman to make a homosexual.|`|lvF5Tpniaa	Maybe it would be easier for you to think about left handed people. Being gay is just as valid in an evolutionary way as being left handed.<br>  For example: I am completely gay, yet I fathered a child. There is no dead end with me. So, just as left handed people can function in a right handed world, gays can reproduce.|`|NwXnzARwaa	Scientific research publications from October 2004 and June 2008 stated that scientists have found that women tend to have more children when they inherit the same genetic factors linked to homosexuality in men. This fertility boost more than compensates for the lack of offspring fathered by gay men, and keeps the “gay” genetic factors in circulation. A lead researcher said "You have all this antagonism against homosexuality because they say it's against nature because it doesn't lead to reproduction. We found out this is not true because homosexuality is just one of the consequences of strategies for making females more fecund" and that their findings offered "a solution to the Darwinian paradox and an explanation of why natural selection does not progressively eliminate homosexuals."|`|Jr5YZ8Qbaa	That's a great big "if". If it is genetic, it could be a recessive gene like haemophilia so the homosexuality emerges only if both parents carry the gene. Gay people can, of course, have children of their own.|`|65QqZBnjaa	First of all evolution is messy.  All kinds of varaitions; it's not the staid, simple process you seem to believe.<br>  <br>  Second, I wish this question would go extinct because it's been asked a ZILLION times already.|`|1rmSuG2Haa	That is mother nature's way of population control. =)|`|CfZn9kK5aa	No. If it is genetic, it is a recessive gene.<br>  <br>   Recessive genes do not just die out. For instance, infants born with Juvenile Tay Sachs Disease die before they reach 5, but it has not yet died out.<br>  <br>   Then you take into consideration how man homosexuals through out history have reproduced due to force, family obligation, or to hide their homosexuality. I can guarantee you that millions of homosexuals have reproduced. Spreading the recessive trait.|`|XuhQS9wsaa	Hey! This is my theory! Back off bud. haha<br>  <br>  No but seriously. I always tell my straight friends that gay people are just more evolved because as humans, we have naturally realized that we are over populating and so we must compensate and reserve our resources by slowing the growth of our race in the safest way possible. But we enjoy sex too much so we continue to phuck!|`|uKrRyVgVaa	Gay people can still have straight sex. It's all good if we get too much gays we will force them to make babies....BABIES!!!<br>  2 Reef<br>  Reef there pal you obviously don't know that theory about genetics and gays. The theory states that gay gene is developed (mutation if u want to call it that) which means that over time there will be no straight people but only gays. Sure does take man and a woman to make a gay. Frankly i don't see any logic in your answer sorry : (|`|d28067f1a921a90f7f3de7ed58b0e54caa	Yes I suppose, in a Darwin sense..................But unlike animals, we Gay humans can adopt children.

We can still reproduce with the opposite sex.  All we lack is a physical attraction - since when has THAT truly prevented two people from reproducing?|`|d65dffc98a44020e5fef73822d495444aa	sort of. but what if everyone reproduced? then there would be too many people and how would we feed them?<br>  also what of straight people who are sterile?|`|grYkoDaraa	no seeing how lesbians can have children and there will always be more straight people
cL6CWj2waa	Hi Peter, I quote that long passage as far as my memory can go...<br>  <br>  so here is my take on it <br>  <br>  To be or Not to be, Shakespeare is basically asking a rhetorical question, he is actually stating that it is your choice, one way or the other is just  as effective or uneffective. If you take up arms against a sea of troubles (fight) or just stand there and be passive (suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune), either choice has consequences. Maybe too he is being sarcastic, in that some situations seem so predestined that no-one really can make much of a difference.<br>  <br>  then again i could be wrong.... (this is the spirit of the poem - )|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Here it is...short and sweet. <br>  <br>  READ THE PLAY.  And you'll understand what it means.|`|njrKjJVwaa	The phrase "to be, or not to be" comes from William Shakespeare's Hamlet (written about 1600).

They're doing the same thing with werewolves now (which they've started calling "lycans" because it sounds more poetic... gag me...).|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	Stephen King thinks it sucked on a literal and a literary level.<br>  <br>  I have to agree.

uBkvqcY6aa	I totally get what  you're saying.  Having gone to 1 gay bar with a group of gay/lesbian friends.  The scene was very similar.  I was blown away by watching a "dancer" basically fellated in this public venue and nobody seemed to mind.  I thought to myself were this any other club everyone would be under arrest.  Then I also stepped back a sec and thought how persecuted all these people would be under different circumstances and figured what the "F" let em have their fun.  I'm not gay but I can certainly sympathize.|`|pYn2L2DHaa	This might surprise you, but this gay man would have lasted about three minutes in that bar before saying, "Well, I've seen what I need to see here -- any other places we can go?"    If I'm going to go to a bar, I'm happiest at a wine bar where I can sit down, have some decent wine with friends, listen to nice jazz, and have a nice conversation where I can here myself and others talk.|`|N73oZyY8aa	When I read illogical party I thought this would be a question about Republicans. Imagine my surprise. I know what you mean but that type of stuff goes on in straight bars all the time.  You're accustomed to it, it's been put before you since before you can speak. That's what makes it stand out so much.|`|NWopkX4baa	The same things happen at straight bars. What's your point?|`|xzl9njBXaa	The Bible says,"My people are destroyed because of a lack of know-ledge",you on other hand,have a certain amount of consciousness that allows you to be judgmental in your observation.AIDS is a reality that's ignored on SO MANY levels, and the sad part is,Life will still function.By the way, you are you,so keep yourself conscious and strive to inform others on the dangers.Sodom was destroyed for the practice which was performed within its society,not everyone who live there practiced what was forbidden,but it became as America is today.A place where one can engage in indecent and uninspired acts,so therefore ALL inhabitants of that place were punished by GOD himself.As the lords vicegerents on this planet,we have a duty to uphold, if we choose not to ,we will face HIS wrath.

WNIL4sLiaa	My X dumped me for a female over the phone. I was crushed. He phoned again a week later and I made it clear to everyone in my home to tell him I wasn't in. This went on for several months. I received a letter with an apology and the "Why" he dumped me and that he still wanted me to be his 'best friend' and that he wanted me to be part of 'their' life as such. It took me three weeks to respond to him telling him how he made me feel and what he put me through. I told him 'why' I believed he did it to me in the first place. It was another month before I actually talked to him on the phone. When he started telling me about his 'wife' I told him I wasn't interested, that he had his life and that I was moving on. That we could be friends, but it would be some time if ever I'd actually come over for a b-b-q. We could write or chat on the phone.<br>  His marriage lasted two months before she dumped him. He tried to cry the blues to me and admitted that he knew how I must have felt. He wants me back in his life as before, but again, I told him the jury was out for the meantime, but lets just write and phone now and then to see how much we truly miss each other.<br>  Once burnt, twice learned.<br>  And yes, even though it's been nearly two years, I still love him and pray that he truly loves me and someday we'll try again, but only when I'm sure of his honesty and loyalty.|`|2DahzSWvaa	That's cold.

M3Xmqlt8aa	Wow! Lyle, what a display of exercising liberty without compassion. That impresses God and the Ladies, LMAO! Besides she knows the Bible better than 10 people like you!<br>  <br>  Anyway,<br>  <br>  Gods intelligent do understand according to the law of process either by accepting the teachings of those that understood before them or by discovering what is to be understood for their self. Nature has all of the rules of what will work and what will not work displayed in it. This includes everything there is to know about, Mathematics, Astronomy, Chemistry, Biology, Psychology, and Metaphysics or Spirituality. <br>  <br>  Intelligence is a mystery in itself and should not be confused with apparent consciousness, or simple acquisition of knowledge. It is rather the hardware that the rest is imprinted upon.<br>  <br>  The real problem becomes one of a religious and political nature, as Science, Religion, and the Occult all play with the same deck of cards so to speak. The confusion is that they use different rules to interpret the meaning of what has been discovered, and these rules after viewed for a time can be seen to reflect the motives of the respective groups and individuals, as well as the fact that they all fail to acknowledge where the basic ideas come from.<br>  <br>  I will give an example. The Periodic table of the elements was predicted by the use of a Tarot deck, by Mendeleev in 1861 a scientist playing a game is what we are told, but this game revealed a rythum to the make up of particals that were known at the time and predicted many that were found later. Though it is seldom questioned weather Einstein used these same system to come up with his Famous E=MC2 it is doubtless that the 3 spacial and 1 time dimension can be demonstrated perfectly by the 4 elements of the Tarot, the Principal of Triune formations is ubiquitous, and the resultant Quatrain formations are demonstratable as well. It is not a mere trick, it is a fact that there are only 3 principals, only 3 basic particals, 3 spacial diamensions that can not be avoided at any cost. This is so fundamental and so subtle that it is rarely even noticed. The original ideas were Jewish, The Catholic Church knows more about Occult science than nearly any magician or witch ever dreamed of. Yet none admit it openly. The Idea of a Triune Deity is layed out in black and white in the Kabala's Tree of life diagram. It is a template that is used to read Tarot by as well, The Ain Soph Aur is the Triune God head Elohim aka YHVH. There is no real question of where the Church of Rome came up with the Trinity, weather they remember that is another matter all together.<br>  <br>  It seems that some bent sense of personal pride comes with being the ones to hold all the knowledge. It is rediculous, the intelligence is a created template to decipher the World. Group, Disapline, Religion, Government, all are without stability laying claim to being the ( Right ones) in the debate of what this all is, and what it means, it is all dishonesty when there is only one real source and to many magicians claiming to have exclusive rights to it.<br>  <br>  The Scripture says "My People parish for lack of knowledge" and in the Apocrypha, It says of the Nicolations, " They have taken the keys to the Kingdom and hidden them"<br>  <br>  Great Q|`|TgfuqPiLaa	God's people DO understand Him by studying and living by His word.<br>  The trinity theory you quoted is a confused doctrine made up from the minds of confused men and not taught in the bible. <br>  <br>  For God is not the author of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.      1 Corinthians 14:33|`|FarsCSY1aa	God didn't create anything, nor does he want anything, because he does not exist.

Stevie, I'm in a funny mood and would rather answer Lyle's question.  Please don't report me:<br>  <br>  Why did God command 'thou shalt not kill' then go on to command his people to leave not one woman or child alive in the cities of Canaan?<br>  <br>  Why does God command us not to have other gods 'before him'?  Can we worship them if they are secondary?<br>  <br>  Why will my 'days be long' if I worship, as commanded, my mother and father?<br>  <br>  Why am I commanded not to 'suffer a witch to live'?  What harm do witches actually do if they are powerless?<br>  <br>  There is plenty that is hard to understand about God's commandments.  Impossible, I'd even venture.<br>  <br>  <br>  LYLE:<br>  <br>  So deliberately killing all the women and children during war is not murder?  I disagree.   I apologise for writing 'worship' rather than 'honour', but the point remains.  As to the piosoner [sic],  I am not sure what they are, but it seems like a pretty peculiar mistranslation for that to have come out as 'witch'.  Also, I think that you have misunderstood my objection to the 'no other gods' commandment.  My point is that the commandment is not 'thou shalt have no other gods.', but 'thou shalt have no other gods before me'.  Why?  Do other gods exist?  Can we worship them as lesser gods?
KBBonf97aa	The age gap is substantial because both of you are at completely different places in your lives.  If you were 30 and she was 40, it wouldn't matter nearly as much, since you'd both be very settled into your adult identities.  But at 20, you're just entering adulthood.  Most people undergo huge changes in their 20s, since they're living independently for the first time and learning how personal and career decisions have an impact on the rest of their lives.  Most people are very different at 30 than they were at 20, so you're just beginning a journey that she's already finished.<br>  <br>  The age gap doesn't mean the relationship is hopeless, but the odds of you two spending your lives together are probably against you.  Just play things by ear and don't let anyone convince you the relationship is bad, even if it doesn't last forever.|`|skpoOhfmaa	Your mother sounds a bit hypocritical, that's only two years less than your relationship.

HjFisSCXaa	Ulysses (Odysseus) is said to be a "human Zeus", blessed with cunning intelligence, physical strength and godly luck - one of the greatest men (by ancient Greek standards).   His wife Penelope is also the perfect woman: beautiful, graceful and caring; but also famous for her cleverness and faithfulness to her husband.   She's probably important due to the archetype she portrays - "The Perfect Wife":   - she managed to remain faithful to Ulysses;  - raised his son, Telemachus;  - managed to protect their family and their home;   (I always imagined the "ragged Ulysses", dreaming about his warm cozy home & Penelope's cooking )     Helen of Troy - "the face that launched a thousand ships." (Christopher Marlow). She is extremely beautiful, but she is criticized as being  "of week mind and spirit".   Apparently she willingly left behind her husband Menelaus and Hermione, their daughter, to be with Paris. This traitorous act was done under  Aphrodite's spell or rather with her help or blessing. She is the symbol of  beautiful but fickle woman, the cause of many rivalries, and the (given) reason for the Trojan War.    Helen's relationship with Paris varies depending on the source of the story. In some, she loved him dearly while in others, she was portrayed as his unwilling captive in Troy, or as a cruel, selfish woman.

The word "Jesus" implies "Savior" and "Christ" means "anointed one." Therefore "Jesus Christ" is God's ANOINTED SAVIOR. He is the virgin born Son of God (Isa. 7:14; Mat. 1:23) who was born into this world to be the sinless sacrifice for the sin of the world (Jhn. 1:29; Rev. 13:8). His birth, life, ministry, and crucifixion were all pre-planned in the heart of God, and He was obedient unto death (Phi. 2:8). Jesus lived a sinless life and gave Himself as a payment for the sins of the world. He was resurrected for our justification (Rom. 4:25), and He is currently seated at the right hand of God as our high priest and mediator (Rom. 8:34; Heb. 3:1; 10:12; I Tim. 2:5). He will soon return to this earth to receive His saints unto Himself (Jhn 14:1-3), and to take over the kingdoms of this present evil world (Rev. 11:15-17; 19:11-21). Until then, all who believe on Him may have eternal life and enter into the glories of Heaven.    Most immediately assume that  Kingdom of Heaven is the same as the Kingdom of God, but it isn't. Just as God and Heaven are not the same, the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of Heaven are not the same. God is spiritual (Jhn 4:24), while Heaven is God's physical creation (Gen. 1:1). Hence the Kingdom of God is a spiritual kingdom, while the kingdom of Heaven is a literal and physical kingdom. God gave Adam dominion over this kingdom in Genesis 1:28. It's an earthly kingdom, but it was God's will for it to be run "as it is in heaven" (Mat. 6:10). As the Old Testament continues, we find God appointing different men over this physical kingdom (Noah, Abraham, David, Solomon, etc). Evidently, the Kingdom of Heaven departed in Jeremiah chapter 22, when God swore than no descendant of Coniah would prosper sitting upon the throne of David. This ushered in the "times of the Gentiles" (Luk. 21:24) with the Babylonian captivity. Then came the kingdoms of the Medes and Persians, then the Greeks, then the Romans. According to Luke 4:6, Satan is in charge of these worldly kingdoms, and he gives them to whomever he wishes. II Corinthians 4:4 says that he is the "god of this world."   Then came GOD'S King, the Lord Jesus Christ, the King of the Jews, the Messiah. The Jews knew that God had promised them a kingdom (Gen. 49:10; Isa. 2:1-5; Isa. 49:5-13; Psa. 2; Jer. 23:5; Luk. 1:30-33, etc.). John the Baptist and Jesus both preached that the kingdom of heaven was at hand (Mat. 3:2; 4:17), but the Jews REJECTED their King and chose a GENTILE king instead (Jhn. 19:15). Therefore the kingdom was NOT restored to Israel. After the resurrection, the disciples asked Jesus if He was now going to restore the kingdom to Israel (a literal, physical, and visible kingdom--the Kingdom of Heaven), and He said, ". . . . It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power." (Acts 1:6-7) They were not asking Him to restore the SPIRITUAL Kingdom of God (Rom. 14:17), for they never had it to start with! They'd never been born again by the Spirit of God! They wanted THEIR kingdom back--the literal and physical Kingdom of Heaven.   Now, when Jesus returns the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of Heaven will actually become one, but let's not make the mistake of thinking that they're the same now. One is spiritual, while the other is physical.|`|qhiEVoRqaa	To be sacrificed for our sins but he brought the passover for the promise|`|REC4YgOuaa	why don't you read the bible like anyone else and find out, or better yet why don't you take your *** to church...|`|KWwW7N49aa	To restore mankind to have fellowship with God once again.|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	Heb 2:14   Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
EYqTV2EYaa	Exactly what is this term 'politically correct?' If it's against offending people, it shouldn't be a problem. I mean, even with 1st amendment laws, no one in general wants to be insulted by the media, which brings people to stereotype. Remember the past involving Blacks. When Blacks were depicted in the media, they were done so in cruel ways to dehumanize them by having them look ugly, eat watermelon, act unintelligent, and basically, made them seem non-human. As a result, the viewers stereotyped Blacks, and they were never taken seriously until the Civil Rights Movement. Therefore, we should watch what we say because uneducated viewers of the media would begin to hate, then conspire to murder groups, just like in the past. However, if you're referring to crazy and non-serious things such as using "African-American" instead of "Black" or un-segregating bathrooms for gays and transgenders, I think that may be a little too far. Other than that, I say it's a good idea because it can balance out and/or prevent offensive stereotypes, which can lead to violent racism.

uBNX4Cg7aa	You sound depressed (obviously) and you need some professional help, but barring that her are a few things you can do. First of all, I'd bet a million dollars that you aren't half as worthless as you think you are. I know this because often I feel the exact same way. Step back and try to look at yourself objectionally. Look at your grades. Are they good? Look at your brain. I'd bet that you're smarter than the average bear (internalized people like you usually are). Stop focusing on the bad things and try to focus on the good.<br>  <br>  I am 17 and I've never even gone on a date. Don't worry about boys not looking at you.You're only 13. Chances are you aren't even near full grown, and a lot of girls are plain up until the middle of high school and then they suddenly become gorgeous (I know a girl who that happened to). That very well could happen to you. And I have to repeat, you're only 13. In my opinion that's too young to even be going on dates. So don't worry about that. Come high school you may very well find that changing.<br>  <br>  And as for the cutting and attempting suicide, STOP IT RIGHT NOW. Yes, that's easy for me to say, but you really need to. It's not going to help you at all and will only hurt you and the others around you. If you don't like yourself so much that you don't care about hurting yourself, think of your family and friends. If you were to commit suicide you would hurt them far more terribly than you could imagine, because they would be riddled with guilt for the rest of their lives. So when you think about doing these things, for the love of your family, DON'T.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped a little bit. Feel absolutely free to email me if you ever want to. And I really mean that.|`|S6MqrWdjaa	stick it out. 20yrs old for me was way better than being a 13 y/o depressed little girl that knew everything about nothing (thats who i was)... realize life is precious and 13 is still a child. you are what you make yourself and depression clouds reality a lot. work on your depression and doing what makes you happy. study death but appreciate life. good luck and stick it out everyone goes through tough phases in life cuz thats life.|`|TfLPRwFWaa	Go and see a counseler...<br>  <br>  NOW|`|J9EUVqKvaa	Suicide is never the answer.

(Although I must admit; it did make me 'lol')<br>  <br>  Look; you're 13 years old. You're not old enough to have experienced anything interesting in life yet. I had suicidal thoughts for about a year during the 9th grade, and I am SO glad I didn't. I wrote suicide notes, I spent all the time in the world alone, I held bottles of pills in my hand at night just thinking; wondering whether it would be the right choice or not. I was in the same situation you are now; my parents were disappointed in me (I didn't play sports- only the guitar and my dad was a football player all through highschool and my mom just had no patience with me), no girls payed attention to me unless they were talking to me just to later laugh with their friends about something stupid I had said or how I looked or something, and I didn't really think I was anything important. My advice to you is a little lame, but true. Life is a lot like teaching yourself the guitar. It'll be a little while before you start to see results, being able to play what you want to play and really start to impress others with what you've accomplished. You really just have to hang in there; it only gets better from where you are now. S**t has a habit of clearing itself up, trust someone who knows.<br>  <br>  P.S. The cutting is a bad path. I wasn't a victim of that but someone extremely close to me was and is just now getting better.<br>  <br>  Even if you don't know me, don't care what I have to say, or don't believe me I really do hope this helps.|`|F8E9JpmSaa	Well let me tell you, this February 22nd will be the four anniversary of a friend of mine who completed his task of committing suicide.

Instead of focusing your attention on how you don't meet other peoples standards, focus your attention on helping others.  It's a great feeling.  I'm sure you're a wonderful person also.

I hate to sound patronizing, but at your age, you are having some hormonal changes.  Talk to a teacher you like, or a school counselor and maybe they can help you find out what's going on.

I was second of 7 kids in a divorced marriage where both parents wanted nothing to do with us. At the age of 9 I wanted to die. I slit my wrists horizontal, took a bunch of pills that I found, and still I lived. <br>  <br>  Growing up was terrible. I was made fun of by other kids, and fought with many of them. <br>  <br>  I was living on the streets by the age of 13. I had to fend for myself. Where to sleep, where to live, how to eat, etc, was all on me. <br>  <br>  Many more times I thought of giving up. But still, I hung on and kept trying. <br>  <br>  I grew to an adult, had a wife, a son, and it fell apart. I stayed stronge, was there for my son, and fought the ex in court. I got married again with a wife that didn't understand how much I loved my son and wanted to be a part of his life. <br>  <br>  The ex lied and won in court, and the new wife didn't understand the love for my son, and I fell apart as an adult. I lost everything I had worked for; my home, my possessions, my job, and even questioned my sanity. I ended up living on the streets homeless. <br>  <br>  I was diagnoed my doctors, and they experimented with drugs on me, and nothing worked. I was depressed just like you and thought that I have nothing in my life that is of any good to anyone. I am here for no reason, and the world would be better off without me. <br>  <br>  Time went by. I found the inner strength to continue on. And since that time that I didn't give up, I have influenced many peoples lives, helped many, and helped myself. I took a 3 month trip to Asia, and Guam, USA. I continued with my school, had a second son who is healthy and smart. I stood up for what I believed in, and helped many underdogs in their fight against injustice. <br>  <br>  I could have killed myself a long time ago. That would have been an easy and cowards way out, but I did not. And since I have not, I have had many beautiful life experiences that so many times I actually pray and say, "Thank you God for my life and everything you have given to me. Also, the prayers where I wished I was dead, please ignore that and keep me safe from harm, and to enjoy the life I have been given. <br>  <br>  Just hang in there. Boys? Ah, don't worry bout that, boys come and go. What is more important is "YOU". I am sure you will touch the lives of so many, but not if you go before your time. And if you are to go, then let it be not by your choice, but of fate. <br>  <br>  One good thing you got going for you: You can not really live until you accept death.... and if you thought about and accepted it, then enjoy your life without worry.... cus death is the end game.. .. everything in between you should have a blast and not worry about anything.|`|Y96jpGe2aa	I know what you are going thru.  I had a friend before that talked about him killing himself all the time.   I remember he would always say, "bro, if I died will you miss me.  I just want to die and see if anybody loves me."  Apparently the problem he had was his self-worth, I had to go to leaps and bounds just to make him realize his worth.  You are young but YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE TO LOVE YOURSELF FIRST BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE LOVES OR LIKES YOU.  I suggest, write down the things that you hate about yourself, then read it and say declare to yourself I ACCEPT THESE NEGATIVE FEELINGS AND I AM LETTING THEM GO. Then TEAR THE PAPER OFF and THROW IT.<br>  After that, WRITE DOWN THE THINGS THAT YOU LOVE ABOUT YOURSELF! THE THINGS THAT YOU APPRECIATE ABOUT YOURSELF.  Now, if you are going to tell me that WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT I LIKE ABOUT MYSELF.  I am going to tell you that that is IMPOSSIBLE.  There would always be things you like about yourself!  It maybe difficult at first to look for the things that you love about yourself but don't be such a perfectionist, even the small things that you do good and like about yourself you can write them down.<br>  Post this little note that you wrote somewhere you can see it all the time. (Maybe infront of your mirror or on the ceiling of your bed so when you wake up and go to sleep you will see it and be reminded of your good traits)  <br>  Just relax and hang on, it's normal not be liked if you don't FOCUS on liking and appreciating yourself.<br>  Also join some clubs that will help you give back to some people.  Giving is the fastest way to help yourself. ;)

And what is the difference between "new generation whites" and "old generation whites?"      I'll try to answer as best as I can...Just because you are clean cut, does not mean that you are conservative, and vice versa.  If you are conservative, it doesn't mean that you are white, nor does it automatically mean that you are a sell out.  People, in general, have differing views, especially in politics.  Just because one is white, it doesn't mean that the majority of whites are conservative, or liberal.  I think many people in general have become more liberal because of the crap the Bush put our country though.    In regards to possessing 60% non white artists in music collection..I don't even know what the hell this means.  I love music in general.  I have many many artists, and probably 65? of the artists are "non-white".  What does that have to do with anything?    I don't even know how to answer this question, so I am going to stop rambling.  Hope you get the answer that you were looking for.

UkaH2iouaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  It is known that if you worship God naturally you will feel regret about your sin and try to change.<br>  <br>  And this is how it is known that you will repent and purify yourself, thus you are forgiven before you even commit the deed. Though, true devotion is required, until you reach the extent of not commiting any sin at all.|`|ylaGS5EHaa	No, the desire to commit sin is a sin itself, btw I am not of the opinion that you say one little prayer to Jesus and you're good for life.

AND if you figure out that Jesus died (past tense) for your sins (past, present, and future) then ... yes.|`|T8X7mrtHaa	Since God already knows what deeds you will do, he must also already know whether he forgives you for them or not.|`|bf2a3cdfd3a1c0386023cef0e5cd4b0faa	No you must feel regret about your sin and then ask for forgiveness.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	no<br>  <br>  if it has not be committed yet then there is nothing to be forgiven.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	No|`|qCtbizzPaa	That's called an indulgence and it sparked the Protestant Reformation.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	No, of course not, common sense would  tell you that you have to sin first , then repent, and then be forgiven...that is the way it goes...|`|NLinPsyhaa	All sin has already been forgiven.

dZkZ6Uuvaa	Like Hitler was stopped and Saddam was stopped, I don't see why anyone else in history would not have been stopped.

CiMaltLBaa	yes, they both interconnect with each other, as you read below, their definitions as well!<br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  <br>  NATIONALITY:<br>  Nationality can refer to membership in a nations (collective of people sharing a national identity, usually based on ethnic and cultural ties and self-determination) even if that nation has has no state<br>  Nationality is a the relationship between a person and their state of origin, culture, association, affiliation and/or loyalty. Nationality affords the state jurisdiction over the person and affords the person the protection of the state<br>  <br>  ETHNIC BACKGROUND:<br>  ethnic group is a group of human beings whose members identify with each other, usually on a presumed or real common heritage. Ethnic identity is further marked by the recognition from others of a group's distinctiveness and the recognition of common cultural, linguistic, religious, behavioral or biological traits, real or presumed, as indicators of contrast to other groups.<br>  Ethnicity is an important means through which people can identify themselves.<br>  <br>  EDIT:::<br>  Ethnic nationalism is a form of nationalism wherein the "nation" is defined in terms of ethnicity. Whatever specific ethnicity is involved, ethnic nationalism always includes some element of descent from previous generations. Furthermore, the central theme of ethnic nationalists is that "...nations are defined by a shared heritage, which usually includes a common language, a common faith, and a common ethnic ancestry."It also includes ideas of a culture shared between members of the group, and with their ancestors, and usually a shared language; however it is different from purely cultural definitions of "the nation" (which allow people to become members of a nation by cultural assimilation) and a purely linguistic definitions (which see "the nation" as all speakers of a specific language).<br>  <br>  The central political tenet of ethnic nationalism is that each ethnic group on earth is entitled to self-determination. The outcome of this right to self-determination may vary, from calls for self-regulated administrative bodies within an already-established society, to an autonomous entity separate from that society, to a sovereign state removed from that society. In international relations, it also leads to policies and movements— to claim a common nation based upon ethnicity.|`|axU5dsp2aa	I agree with the previous answer, but I have a bit to add:<br>  <br>  Nationality is more like "citizenship" and "residence" and ethnicity is more like "race". It can get confusing sometimes, because many European, Marxist and post-Marxist countries refer to ethnic minorities are referred to as "national minorities" or "nationalities" (see: China, former Yugoslavia). In New World countries, ethnic groups can sometimes be referred to as "national ancestry" groups.

Allah Says (interpretation of meaning): {Perform AsSalat (Iqamat-as-Salat) from mid-day till the darkness of the night (i.e. the Zuhr, 'Asr, Maghrib, and 'Isha' prayers), and recite the Qur'an in the early dawn (i.e. the morning prayer). Verily, the recitation of the Qur'an in the early dawn is ever witnessed (attended by the angels in charge of mankind of the day and the night).} [17:78]. Allah also Says (interpretation of meaning): {… Verily, the prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.} [4:103].<br>  Buraida reported on the authority of his father that a man came to the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) and asked about the times of prayer. Upon this the Prophet said: "Pray with us these two, meaning two days. When the sun passed the meridian, he gave command to Bilal who uttered the Azan for prayer, then he commanded him and pronounced Iqama for noon prayer (then at the time of the after noon prayer) he again commanded him, and Iqama for the afternoon prayer was pronounced, when the sun was high, white and clear. He then commanded and Iqama for the evening prayer was pronounced, when the sun had set. He then commanded him the Iqama for the night prayer was pronounced when the twilight had disappeared. He then commanded him and the Iqama for the morning prayer was pronounced, when the dawn had appeared. When it was the next day, he commanded him to delay the noon prayer till the extreme heat had passed and he did so, and he allowed it to be delayed till the extreme heat has passed. He observed the afternoon prayer when the sun was high, delaying it beyond the time he had previously observed it. He observed the evening prayer before the twilight had vanished, he observed the night prayer when a third of the night had passed; and he observed the dawn prayer when there was clear daylight. The Prophet said: "Where is the man who inquired about the time of the prayer?" The inquirer said: Messenger of Allah! Here I am. The Prophet said: The time of your prayer is within the limits of what you have seen" [Reported by Imams al-Bukhari and Muslim ].<br>  The first day the Prophet performed the prayers in the beginning of their fixed times. The next day he delayed them till just before the end of their time and then performed them and informed them that the time of the prayers is whenever one wants between the two times. There are many more Hadith specifying the times of the prayers.<br>  If you can find out the times of prayers as mentioned above it is better; otherwise, enquire of a knowledgeable person or the Muazzin or Imam of a mosque in your area or you may refer to a reliable calendar that presents the times of the prayers, or you may even use a reliable program in this matter.<br>  Allah knows best.|`|7aoHmM4baa	may god help you inchalah<br>  may god open doors for you<br>  and take of the rocks from your road<br>  amine|`|AA10125956	waalaikum salam<br>  <br>  Sorry i cant answer your question because i personally dont know for sure and if im wrong i dont want to pass on the info.

iHDYncuXaa	The way you know that the bible is true is that it took over 40 authors to write it. With all those books, chapters and verses, there is not 1 verse written that doesn't have another verse backing it up. Every verse supports another. It's confirmation that only God could pull this all together.|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	Ha.  The Bible is a book only a committee could pull together.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	Your question has a premise that man wrote the Bible. That is not true. The Bible is inspired by God. The answer is prophecy. The prophecy in the Bible has shown that the message is consistent, congruent and fulfilled over a span of about 4500 years. It takes some research and an OPEN MIND to see this. <br>  If you chose to seek the truth you will find it, but it's not going to pop out at you. You need to go to a Church that studies the Bible, and continue asking questions, more specific. I can give you endless examples of fulfilled prophecy. Isaiah has proven to be older than the time of Jesus based on the Dead Sea scrolls findings, and they predict the coming of Jesus. The day that Jesus rode a donkey into Jerusalem and was hailed as king was predected by the day by the prophet Daniel. It goes on and on.<br>  To answer your last question. The key point is congruency. 40 different people who didn't know each other had the same message and prophecy and wrote 66 books of the Bible that all agree with other. <br>  When you study the Bible you are studying God's word, and it becomes evident when you study it.|`|04f345ca740404026090acf2b474e49caa	I believe in the Bible because I believe God.<br>  <br>  Same way that inspiration comes to people that speak the Word of God.  Only its in print.<br>  <br>  We know because the Holy Spirit reveals Gods truth and we are able to discern things that are not true based on Scripture and the Spirit.<br>  <br>  If you or any other person said something that wasnt of God we can tell by testing it against what God has said and the Holy Spirit.|`|bf2a3cdfd3a1c0386023cef0e5cd4b0faa	I do not follow the Bible literally... the only rules in the Bible I follow are the 10 commandments... and to treat others kindly.<br>  <br>  The rest of the Bible is filled with parables and points of views either inspired by God or just their own opinions.|`|MJyM1XWJaa	Jesus said himself that without miracles they will not believe. So sounds like you're still needing your miracle. Or maybe they happen and you just attribute it to luck?<br>  <br>  Not everything is black and white, certain things are. Like pregnancy. You either are or you are not. <br>  <br>  The thing about those who believe in God is that while we believe in God, we question our own beliefs and we question the Bible and interpretations of such. To us, God is big enough for any question we have. The danger is doubt. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps even ifonly a little.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	no the holy spirit we have from god instructs us and tells us.<br>  <br>  the holy spirit inspired thye men who wrote the bible.<br>  <br>  The same holy spirit instructs us|`|lsO9Dr09aa	This is exactly what makes me think that religion is sort of ... a scam.<br>  <br>  How come i can't write a book telling everyone what to do and say that a magical flying pig told me to write it?<br>  What if it caught on and there were other "religions" about cats and dogs and cows?<br>  And what if people thought that when they talk to themselves mentally, that's the magical animal talking to them?<br>  <br>  Then you have a bunch of psychos on your hands<br>  same with religion.|`|dDprsKZYaa	Silly rabbit...<br>  You can't apply logic to the bible.|`|oopg697aaa	Stop reading Bible|`|OMgF0RcIaa	What if man had said that we should all pray to a bunny?

qpby6jMaaa	There are no good spiritual reasons to move from the Catholic Church to any of the Protestant Churches.  I myself was raised in the Lutheran Church, and while I enjoyed it... what I have found is that the Lutheran Church is basically the Catholic Church, but watered down.  If there is one Conclusion I have come to, it is that the Christian Faith is not something that was intended to be stripped down to it's basic form... but something, like Love, that is meant to grow and expand in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the faith and grow closer to God.<br>  <br>  The Protestant "keep it simple stupid" methodology seems to fall flat, because God is anything but simple.... why should his Church be?|`|dDprsKZYaa	1: The Lutherans are no crazier than the rest of the loons.<br>  <br>  2: Change of scenery.<br>  <br>  3: Why the 7734 (upside down) not!|`|bKwCs8zhaa	Assuming there is even 1?<br>  Yeh, sleep well Cathtard.|`|c0KKHMsAaa	you know this sort of intra-christian bickering makes me laugh.|`|67EaIAvbaa	revelation 22:17-21..1 reason why not to.|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	Marriage is the only 'rational' reason.|`|bf2a3cdfd3a1c0386023cef0e5cd4b0faa	Why don't you just be a non-religious Believer?

Why does someone have to speak the language or have to have been born in that country to be considered that race or ethnicity.  White people usually just say we are white, but if someone asks me, "What are you specifically?"   I can say that I am German and English with a bunch of other "white" ethnicities.  I'm not Polish, Swedish, or Irish, just as some full blooded Chinese girl isn't Japanese.  Just like you are not of Puerto Rican decent.  I just don't understand why you are so confused in this matter. BTW African Americans are Black just as Africans are Black.  Blacks from the US do not act or speak like Blacks do in Africa, yet we still call them "AFRICAN" Americans.  It's all about your race and ethnicity, not what you do, how you act or how you talk. What do you want people to say if they are a Chinese born American?  Do they just say that they are Asian?  I think that being of Chinese decent is very different from being of Korean or Japanese decent.  Just as it is very different to be from Cuban decent or Mexican decent.  A black Cuban would not say that he is Black.  He would say he is Cuban.  A more Spanish looking Cuban would not say he is Spanish or white, he would also say he is Cuban.  Would it make it easier for them to all just say that they are Hispanic?  I don't think it would.  Then they would always get the question, "Well, what are you specifically?"|`|5GYaBpWcaa	u sound funny cause they are proud of being Chineese and Japenees etc.  <br>  I was born and raised in America and I have no freaking accent n when one asks me "where I am from" I would say I am Proud Somalian and would not even bother telling him that I was born here unless he asks. I see myself as Somalian and I would consider you Mexican. I don't care where I was born. I am what ma dada n mama are. <br>  <br>  I am Somalian not American. I am proud but u don seem to be. that is the defference between me and you.|`|K7n0DY8Faa	I agree with Ella Blue. You don't have to speak the language just to prove where you came from. Speaking the language just makes you understand more of that culture.|`|eefc786d1aa3ac2e3759499bdd83cf9baa	There is no such thing as Asian American or Asian America.|`|OJ86MRkCaa	CAn i ask a question? seriously<br>  Where are you living now??|`|VLwox49Saa	Alert: You are giving off Major Racist/Discriminatory Vibes (judging by your poor judgement on this issue) ---Ok vice versa: So let me ask you this. If I grew up in Tahiti (but I am Nigerian descent), learned to speak the native language (not French), eat the native diet (not French cusine), learned and adopted the culture and dance, dressed like the ancient natives did; does that make me a Tahitian. Your ancestral lines define your genetic make up to a degree, but that does not make you who you are. In my hypothetical model I am of Nigerian descent, of the African race, but my nationality is Tahitian. I can personally aknowledge all three, only two, one, or none at all. From what I am getting you are of Mexican descent, but your nationality is American. Racially you could be any one thing or a mix of many things. Its your choice how you express your self first, second, and third. If FIRST you are American, SECOND you are of Mexican descent, and THIRD is your Race fine. That is your choice. Its NOT ridiculous that someone has enough pride to uphold their ancester's heritage so it does not die out in subsequent generations. And no one has to ACT Chinese/Japanese to be Chinese or Japanese. In China and Japan a lot of people act American or European. Would you tell an adopted Chinese child she/he isn't really Chinese because he/she doesn't act Chinese . Is it their fault? You gonna tell an asian/native american/white/or black man or woman that they are not asian/native american/white/ or black because they don't act a certain way. What ACTING are you speaking of. If you have to act then you probably aren't being truthful with youself. Who are you to judge people? Or do you feel misplaced in White-American society like so many other people's of color who are looking for their origins?

FATyhyZ2aa	"Actions speak louder than words."<br>  If you feel these people are not being your friends, trust your instincts.  It sounds more like a clique & they are trying to position you way down the ladder.  You deserve to be around people that WANT your input.  If you keep leaving their company in the middle of conversations to seek out someone else to talk to, and they don't seem interested enough to stop you or at least ask, "Hey, where are you going?," then you've really got your answer.  But if they ask, just tell them, "I came to talk w/ you all, not just to sit and listen."  Again, if they say "Okay," and allow you to depart - not friends.  But if they so, "No, we want to hear what you have to say to but you gotta' jump in & speak up so all of us can hear you."  It could be you just were unaware of their collective conscious set of rules.  /  It's tough to be a loner while you're waiting for the right quality of friend to come along, but they do.  /  I was called "space cadet" behind my back at school.  I was only allowed in cliques b/c my sister was very popular & no one wanted her to hear they had been mean to me.  But I didn't want fake friends so I'd sit alone a lot.  But the few who approached & tallked either really liked me & became strong frinds or chose to go their own way. /  There's a long story about the handsome captain of the football team talking to me so much that cheer leaders tried to become my fake friends to see what I possed that made him interested in me.  I called them on it & they left me alone.  But the secret was that he found it refreshing to talk to girl that was honest w/ him & not trying to gain social staus by being his girlfriend.  He said he could never trust if a pretty girl liked him or his status in school. / Moral:  Be your best self & wait patiently as you attract QUALITY people. / Best to you!|`|qJkRPhIKaa	Just tell them to shut the **** up and stop being their friends.<br>  <br>  If your own friends wont listen to you are they really your friends?<br>  <br>  the answer is absolutely not.|`|GPznIhzMaa	People who don't show you respect are not your friends.

Else you may be leaving friends who you thought didn't care for you, but actually did.<br>  <br>  Witty remarks and comebacks could help get you noticed as well.<br>  <br>  Wost thing you can do is try to play mind games, like leaving the group and waiting/expecting them to stop you.

So he turned and went away in a rage. <br>  <br>  2Ki 5:13  And his servants came near, and spoke unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean? <br>  <br>  2Ki 5:14  Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Peace!|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	No, because the Spirit of God .also called the Spirit of Truth lives inside of me, and I just cannot relate to the lies of the devil any more...|`|NLinPsyhaa	have you looked at things from a Christian perspective?

It can certainly make it hard to believe, but not impossible.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	Yes. It's called being converted to Christianity. Most Christians were at one time agnostics, or lacked faith. Then when they heard the Gospel, they believed, and had doubts after that. There are doubts after you believe too. I could not accept my faith blindly. I knew that you had to take some step of faith, but I had doubts that I wanted to resolve. The main thing that it takes to see things from a Christian perspective is that we understand things the way God sees them, because we read God's word and we have the Holy Spirit to teach us things. So we are actually seeing things through a worldy perspective, then gradually a godly perspective. I don't have much doubts now, but this is a process of continually searching for the truth. If you seek the truth you will find it. Any Christian that doesn't tell you to seek the truth is mistaken.

There is eclipsis in the word 'creideann' after the word "Mura." So, you will want to say " Mura gcreideann t m" (Moor-a gray-jun too may (or m?) )  if it's familiar 'you'. " Mura gcreideann sibh m" (Moor-a gray-jun shiv may (or m?) )  if it is formal 'you' or if you're speaking to more than one person.    Eclipsis does not exist in Scottish Gaelic. Yet, that still doesn't make it any easier to learn than Irish Gaelic. It simply uses more conjunctives and prepositions instead which also complicate the picture.

bMJ0AYI1aa	"To this day the Palestinians claim that the Jews committed Genocide and ethnic cleansing from 1917 till 1967 against Palestinians in order to steal the land."    which is a stupid claim, and offensive to all the real victims of genocide.    the arab population has gone up everywhere: israel, gaza, the west bank, all arab countries. there are over a million arab citizens of israel with full civil rights. again, the arab population has only increased in israel and gaza.    on the other hand, there is not one jewish person left in gaza. all jews have been ethnically cleansed from there, and most jews have been removed from the arab countries.   if there's any ethnic cleansing it has been of jews in the arab world.     it's a good point, the arabs didn't call themselves palestinians until 1967. the name was invented by the romans to talk about the jewish population in the region. they didn't want to use the word "israel" because it implies a state. palestine was the jewish region of the roman empire. it was named after the phillistenes, who were a non-semitic people who are not remotely related to arabs. but the arabs there now call themselves phillistenes in arabic. by the way, everyone should read the hamas charter.|`|SsSIbFhcaa	Well the area was renamed Palestine in 135AD by Rome so anyone living in that area would have been called Palestinian from 135AD on.

They call homes in the area they are targeting and tell people to get out before the bombs drop.    3rd the reason civilians are killed is because Hammas hides among civilians, which is contrary to the laws of war. They also deliberately use civilians as shields and when the shields are hit they then claim Israel killed civilians.    Genocide is defined as: The systematic and planned extermination of an entire national, racial, political, or ethnic group.

Answer:  They are moral to someone without belief in God or the Bible.  There are plenty of those people around.  Also, marriage, by definition is between a male and female.  Just that simple it is !!!

The reason people may think being gay is immoral is based in various religious conceits. Which are obviously not universal and thus cannot be considered realistic or held fast as a universal truth.     the reason gay marriages can be thought of as immoral is obviously because marriage was and is commonly thought of a religious institution. However, in the case of civil marriages, this does not apply because its actually just a legal and binding arrangement and not necessarily religious at all.     Hope that makes sense...

We were sorting through some of my mums things the other week and found love letters that mum and dad had sent each other over 50 years ago when my dad was in service - and some were almost risque for their generation!    You could write down everything that you're feeling and thinking and if you're creative you could even enclose a poem.  Fill the envelope with heart shaped table confetti, and POST it to him, snail mail!    It's ok having email, text and instant messenger and the like, but if that had existed 50 years ago, my daughter and I wouldn't have been able to spend a sunday afternoon sat reading my mum and dads love letters. xx|`|esGTdnC0aa	The whole don't spend money on me is just a kind gesture of i will 'love' you whether or not you buy me stuff. So id say spending money is perfectly ok and will appreciate the surprise of a gift. It depends on what he is into what type of guy he is.     you could send him a photo of the two of you (if you have one)     or     if you do want to spend money on him gadgets are normally good for guys

kCu6Him8aa	SF? I don't even know.    Best thing? Stay home and have a sleep over. ANYWHERE you go out there will be tons of couples and it will break your heart seeing them holding hands, gazing into each others eyes, and kissing. Rent some romantic comedies and pull a Legally Blind. Whenever the man says "I love you" scream "LIAAAAAAAAR" and throw something at him. Then watch some really good friendship movies like Sister Hood of the Traveling Pants, movies full of hunky guys (but not everything should be TOO romantic), and maybe even watch a good horror flick. Focus on each other. Also, I know it sounds cruel... but take pictures of your exes (if you're at the anger stage) and throw darts! It works wonders. Make sure you guys spoil each other! Nothing wrong with two BFFs getting each other silly Valentines!

ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	You know, the folks who state that Bob Marley and Will Rogers were sinners and therefore have no right to judge others are SO very wrong. I would think that it is the sinners who are in the very BEST position to pass judgement over others for THEY have the experience of making mistakes and would have complete understanding of how and why people make such decisions in their lives. Jesus is totally unqualified for the job for HE never really experienced sin. He had the total strenght of the divine to the point at which sin was totally irrelevant to him. He was the son of a carpenter and one himself, he had both parents involved in his life (Plus his father, God). He had the best that a middle class life could present to him and seldom had to worry about where his next meal was going to come from, had many firends and was a healthy person with no disabilities. In other words, he had the perfect life in the perfect circumstances. What does he know about people in hardship who are often in postions where "sin" is often the ONLY option. Therefore how can he possibly judge others for their sins? Will Rogers had it pretty good for most of his life but he was under the pressure of fame tolive a material life. Bob Marley was a Jamacan and from a very poor family, they managed to be able to supply him with his music and Bob used that music to take a stand against injustice on behalf of the poor. Yes, Bob liked his Ganja, among other vices. Bob and Will both experienced areas in their lives where vice played an important part of their lives and shaped who and what they became. I would certainly trust the judgement of Will and Bob at LEAST as much as I would that of Jesus. I beleive that they hold the better qualifications for the position.<br>  <br>  Brightest Blessings,<br>  Raji the Green Witch|`|cFaCmYrXaa	Are we talking Bob Marley the reggae dude or the Scrooge's downtrodden clerk?.... er wait.... was that Bob Marley or Jacob Cratchit.... or Jacob Marley....no I thought it was Bob... but..... um..... sh!t.... just never mind then.....|`|oopg697aaa	Bob Marley - has experienced it all<br>  <br>  Will Rogers - Don't know him<br>  <br>  Jesus - naaa he was paul's creation|`|gf5ysBCnaa	Don't know Will Rogers.<br>  <br>  Bob Marley would send every one to heaven.<br>  <br>  And Jesus is the right man for the right job.|`|PS6Pjtndaa	You had better PRAY to God that you go before Will Rogers after this quesiton.

I don't see many Christians granting that same benefit to Muslims when they cry about Islamic terrorism.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	Neither. It's about salvation. We all have sinned, and are in need of a savior. Jesus died on the cross for our sins, to take the penalty for our sins, and to show his love for us. He was sin-less, so he raised again on the third day conquering death so that those that believe in Him will not perish but have everlasting life. Does this sound like hate speech?|`|EepiLrmZaa	it is a money machine. jesus is a product. remember that little thing called christmas ?  they hate atheists but the xian merchants  don't mind taking our money.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	both it's two two groups in one . christianity is a religious group and christianity is a hate group too.<br>  Double your pleasure.|`|ItjUfDplaa	A religion.<br>  <br>  Some Christians are hateful (well, many are), some are not.|`|AA10116612	the HATE group are the ones that are against Christians !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|0PvpGjSqaa	both, as are the majority of religions.|`|feBJEgcgaa	I giant force of Groupthink.|`|CCa9kRHHaa	Sometimes it's both.

They are just "doing the work of their god"|`|A3axVsjuaa	It's a religion that contains hate groups. I'm a Christian, but I dont go around shoving my opinions down other people's throats. I accept any one, as long as they are honest to their own convictions. However, if you take a look into history, Christians are usually the aggressor (i.e., the crusades, spanish inquisition, the american indians etc) people say that they were persecuted and millions of christians died, but not really. A lot did die, but not as many as people think. Most Christians today wouldn't die for their religion.  It was the same back then, especially since christianity was a new religion and easier to be renounced by the former pagans.  And it wasn't the fact that they were Christians that romans hated, it was the fact that they wouldn't pay the taxes (and created other economical problems as well.). In today's society, if Christians didn't pay taxes, would they get away with it? probably not. I digress, Christianity (the essence and principles) is a loving kind religion. However, it's ministers are over zealous and ignorant. hope that helps.|`|qda3oneuaa	Stereo Type...not all christians are like that...but i understand i hate it when people argue with you when you tell them your religion. That's kind of like saying all Mexicans can jump fences (i'm mexican, im the biggest klutz ever...) African Americans are great basket ball players, Caucasians have blond hair and blue eyes (i'm cacasin, i have brown hair and brown eyes), germans are Nazis (im german and i welcom every religion) i mean you cant judge everyone buy the little group. it just so happens that little group is louder and that's why you question weather they are a religion or a hate group, they are TOO loud about their religion or more opinion of their religion.|`|pOlDMXWdaa	Jesus Christ preaches love for mankind. Christians that are saved should be trying to reflect that love. John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he sent his only forgotten son and that whosoever belieth in him shall not perish but have ever lasting life.<br>  <br>  I don't think that sounds like a hate group.|`|Ldxf1tW1aa	I would say...<br>  <br>  <br>  Both|`|OMgF0RcIaa	Both.

Those two are death and infidelity. If one dies or is unfaithful it voids the marriage vows. People (the church definitely included) don't take their vows to heart as they should, and that's really a shame. We are all sinners but c'mon that doesn't give us the right to go freely sin and marry 5 times. As for homosexuality, the Bible says it's among the 7 abominations of God. I know it's probably been said a million times, but if God was ok with homosexuality, then sodom and gomorrah would still be operating as a city rather than a pile of dust.|`|SPNHhFXoaa	Christians like those don't obey most of the bible.<br>  Only the parts that are convenient to them<br>  <br>  Quote: "What is the point of a gay marriage when they CAN'T have children?"<br>  <br>  Whats the point of an infertile marriage when they CAN'T have children? <br>  I wasn't aware baby making was the only thing that made your marriage legit.

I'm so glad you have a bf who can be caring and supportive.<br>  <br>  it may be that you can move on, or it may be that you have to deal with this before you can move on. If you do have to deal with it, do so. No ifs, ands, or buts. And if you have to pursue it in the courts, do so!<br>  <br>  Stand up for your rights, speak out, and know that a lot of people are behind you.<br>  <br>  No matter what anyone's orientation, decent people speak out against molestation.

Being molested can turn you off to sex as you associate it with something hurtful...

It makes me mad that someone took that from you.|`|0121db3d89fa7258a5d230763048afc9aa	I'm not going into detail, because it is very personal but yes, it can effect your sex life. <br>  <br>  It can effect your life in general.|`|392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa	It can,if you let it to.|`|DbZiWhxdaa	i'm sorry that happened...<br>  i do believe it does affect you somehow.. psychologically.. <br>  you weren't prepared for anything sexually obviously because you were a kid.. therefore it is a trauma that you can't serve with sex as any other person. It's normal to feel this way after being molested. You should try going to a psychologist to see your case along with your partner so you can get help with this.|`|aNlnbc5Xaa	im 21 male when i was 5 i gave my first bj to a teen <br>  about 15-17 years of age i don't currently have a relation ship<br>  and haven't in 3 years i never considered it as being molested but<br>  i think it did make me a little gay so i think it can change u a little.|`|Fit17SnVaa	I believe it can and does affect you.

The test point about showing him all the kingdoms of the world was not trying to get Jesus to jump off.

The bible says that Jesus is the SON of God, he claimed to be the SON of God. He said that God knew things that he, the SON, did not know. Satan would have known that it would be futile to take the Creator of the Universe and offer Him anything, since He created everything and all things belong to Him, ultimately. Satan took Jesus, another created angel, who had been born as a man, and offered him something amazing. He offered him all the kingdoms of the world, which were under Satan's' influence, therefore his to offer, for the time being.  Satan's heart was bad, and  it must have seemed that this would have been something that would be pretty hard to pass up, to him, but Jesus had come to declare and sanctify his father, Jehovah, and he refused three times, telling Satan "It is written...". Jehovah had every confidence in Jesus to maintain integrity, and his confidence wasn't misplaced. Jesus was well acquainted with Satan, having been with his father for untold time, and Jesus said about Satan that "He was a liar, and the father of the lie. The truth is not in him." In other words, Jesus knew that everything Satan said is a lie. Jesus knew that his job on earth was to declare the truth about his father.|`|WUjlEuTtaa	Jesus allowed it to be so to teach us that we are all tempted...And that we can resist the temptations presented to us in life...|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Carefully read the verses again and you will find he was being tempted with the same things we are, Fame, Fortune, and Power.|`|AA11008046	Not exactly.

Satan is too intelligent to try and test God which he knows he cannot do in any way. He can only tempt man which even from the start of the life Adam he was able to do.  The authority and power over the earth may really have been given to Satan and the possibility that  he gave it someone who will obey him can be felt by the man with any wisdom to understand why we live in this kind of world we live in.  Can you at least try to question why Drug Lords, Gambling Lords,  Human Smugglers, Prostitution Syndicates, Child Pornography, Pornography Publishers, Game of Chances. and other vices could make those people involved  can live in luxury while only few of those who try to live decently can make it to the top?|`|6pEevKn6aa	God does hold all the power of the world...thats why it was so stupid of Satan to offer it all to Him.|`|MiAOnwN6aa	The souls of men were in the hands of satan because of original sin.

UqgCazhGaa	Bg 15.8 P         The Yoga of the Supreme Person<br>      At the time of death, the consciousness he has created will carry him on to the next type of body. If he has made his consciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat's or dog's body. And, if he has fixed his consciousness on godly consciousness, he will be transferred to Krsnaloka in the spiritual world and will associate with Krsna. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything is finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and his present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One gets a different body according to karma, and he has to quit this body in due course. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of the next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of transmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is called karsati or struggle for existence.<br>  <br>  SB 4.29.64 P Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi<br>     In dreams we sometimes see things that we have never experienced in the present body. Sometimes in dreams we think that we are flying in the sky, although we have no experience of flying. This means that once in a previous life, either as a demigod or astronaut, we flew in the sky. The impression is there in the stockpile of the mind, and it suddenly expresses itself. It is like fermentation taking place in the depths of water, which sometimes manifests itself in bubbles on the water's surface. Sometimes we dream of coming to a place we have never known or experienced in this lifetime, but this is proof that in a past life we experienced this. The impression is kept within the mind and sometimes becomes manifest either in dream or in thought. The conclusion is that the mind is the storehouse of various thoughts and experiences undergone during our past lives. Thus there is a chain of continuation from one life to another, from previous lives to this life, and from this life to future lives. This is also sometimes proved by saying that a man is a born poet, a born scientist or a born devotee.

fnL40sxraa	Most of the time, it isn't worth it to fight back because you aren't going to change someone's mind.  Getting into a fight just proves to them that they got to you.  If they are so set on worrying about how you live your life then let them.  Sometimes, though, if your in the mood, it is ok to fight for yourself.  We just have to use intelligence and wit.  I understand those who take things to heart though, because I am very sensitive sometimes.  But, as long as I'm ok with who I am, it really doesn't matter what somebody else who doesn't, and will never, understand me thinks.

The lds church is about church and keeping it Christ related is important to us. I think the previous poster had it right by saying that its the most true church on the earth and that theres still more doctrine and knowledge to be revealed either in this life or the next. That might sound confusing but its really simple, we believe that revelation hasn't stopped and the correct authority to act in gods name is given through the laying on of hands by a worthy member who has received it. The apostles peter, james, and john appeared to joseph smith and ordained him of this priesthood who they received from Christ. The lds faith is a church of miracles, revelations, blessings, good works, all which is predicated on our faith in Jesus Christ. I forgot to add that we believe the authority to act in gods name was taken from the earth after the killing of the apostles even tho some remnants of Christianity still remained. It resulted in branching sects because the order of the church was gone. We believe the bible to be the word of god when translated correctly and we read it all the time in church, hand in hand with the book of mormon.

uFyycbjiaa	Neither.   The concept of a Messiah has been distorted by the "church".   The original concept within Judaism [seeing as how Christianity broke off from Judaism, it's only logical to take Judaism as the base] is that the Messiah is 100% human. No such Idea as "part-G-d" or "semi-divine" or "divine" ever crosses Judaisms mind.    You're right in questioning the idea of a triune G-d.    Deuteronomy 6:4 says:   "Listen oh Israel, the L-rd our G-d, the L-rd is ONE"    When I say that the Earth has ONE moon, I don't mean that it's One moon comprised of 3 different parts or 3 parts comprise the whole, or 3 moons hidden in one, etc..... It literally means "ONE" moon. And this is the concept that should understood.|`|MiAOnwN6aa	Jesus is BOTH God and real man. God the Son, as the second person of the Trinity, assumed human nature in the form of Jesus. God the Son did not lose His Divinity by assuming human flesh; while at the same time, did not totally absorb human nature to the point of making it meaningless either. There is no such thing as 1/3 of God. All persons in God are co-equally God since there is still only ONE Divine Nature as in ONE God. We worship one God in Trinity and Trinity in Unity.|`|Ll29odpHaa	Yes Jesus is God. You are confusing  Jesus with the Father. The 3 Father , Son and Holy Ghost make up the Godhead. It is kinda like a family of 3. Father, Mother and Child. Together they make a family but individually they each have their own role. In the 1st Chapter of John it is plain to see that Jesus was the creator. In Genesis  chapter 1 it is plain to see that all 3 where really involved in the process of creation.  Just remember that God's thought are much higher than ours. Our finite minds can not comprehend all the wonders of God. But many things are revealed in His word. Hope this helps.

And we believe that Jesus (Peace Be Upon Him) is one his creations. We do NOT believe that god is 3 or made up of 3 personalities. We believe that this was introduced into Christianity through Roman pagan belief.     We believe that the unique nature of God is one, not a triune.    The questiions one should think about is - if Jesus was God or part of God, is he immortal or Mortal. Could you kill him? Yes ort No.    If he is Mortal then he isnt God. If he is Immortal then he is not a man.|`|8IHfytEvaa	I have had a hard time understanding it with my head as well.    Let me try to explain it this way.    Most of use the terms "God" and "Father" interchangeably, and that is not really correct.    All of the following statements are true up to the  - - - - line.    The Father is God.    Jesus is God.    The Holy Spirit is God.    The Father is God but the Father is not Jesus.    The Father is God but the Father is not the Holy Spirit.    Jesus is God, but Jesus is not the Father.    Jesus is God, but Jesus is not the Holy Spirit.    The Holy Spirit is God, but the Holy Spirit is not the Father.    The Holy Spirit is God, but the Holy Spirit is not Jesus.     - - - - - - - -    As one Christian web site put it:    There is One God Who is eternally existent as three Persons.    In the Garden, Jesus was praying to His Father, not to himself.    The New Testament tells us that Jesus always was.    The New Testament tells us that Jesus is the Creator.    John 1:1-4,14 and Col 1:15-17    In Genesis chapter 18, the LORD visited Abraham.    The Hebrew behind the word, "LORD" is YHWH.    If you read that chapter, I'll bet you'll be surprised.    Here is a link with lots of great information:    http://www.allaboutgod.com/who-is-god.ht...|`|NYGDQ3ezaa	God is one- but in three parts -- God the Father, Jesus Christ God's Son, and the Holy Spirit. In Ireland, I think the Christians used the shamrock to show how this would look. Three parts of one whole.  In the Old Testament in Genesis, at the creation of the world, God is mentioned with the Holy Spirit -- the Spirit hovering over the water. In the New Testament, at Jesus' baptism -- maybe Matthew or Luke -- there is a reference to God speaking to Jesus from above and the Holy Spirit decending on Jesus like a dove. Jesus prayed to His Father, God the Father, at the garden of Gethsemane.|`|Tgqji3lLaa	He is imaginary.  There is no god that watches all of us and judges us.

He prayed so that those around him would follow those steps once he left. Humans are on this earth because of sin so Jesus came to show you how to prepare for the last days to receive forgiveness. It is like when parents ground you but your mother goes and tell you in secrecy that if you apoligize to your father a certain way you are no longer grounded. I hope you understand|`|SBL1t3ZSaa	Neither that is why you are having a hard time believing this because you are trying to believe something that was taught to you and does not make sense. The reason for this is because Christianity is a man made religon created to keep its followers believing what it says or face eternal hell fire.    I was once like you being raised Catholic/Christian, the Christian teaching just never added up to 2+2=4, so I went on a search for the truth that is what you must do.    To truly learn about any religion you must read, learn and study for yourself, sometimes it is necessary to ask questions, but you should never just take someones word that what they are telling you is true, you must always do the research yourself to see if it is accurate.     I have done the research and have studied the Christian Bible both the OT and the NT in english and in the original languages that it was written in, Greek for the NT, and Hebrew for the OT.     When you compare a english written Christian Bible to a Torah/Tanach in Hebrew (what the Christians call the OT) you will find that the Christian Bible is full of full of mistranslations, misinterpretations, and contradictions.      All of the prophesies in the Torah/Tanach that are messianic prophesies have been mistranslated and misinterpreted and even been taken out of context in places to make them all point to Jesus as the messiah.     The Christians turned Jesus into a God, the son of God, the savior and the messiah.     Christians identify Jesus as being the Messiah and define him as God incarnated as a man, and believe that he died for the sins of humanity as a blood sacrifice.   This means that one has to accept the idea that the death of Jesus can atone for another person's sins.     The Christian idea of the Messiah also assumes that God wants, and will accept, a human sacrifice, when God has condemned human sacrifice of any kind. Jesus did not die for anyones sins let alone all mankind.     Is God A Lier?      Numbers 23:19) "God is not a man that He should be deceitful, nor a son of man that He should relent.     The answer must be NO!!! God does not lie.      Well now don't you think that if Gods Messiah was supposed to suffer and die for the sins of mankind, and then have a second coming to finish what he didn't do the first time that God would have said something like this in his Holy Torah?      The Messiah when he comes will be born from 2 human parents, he will be an ordinary person, and he will fulfill ALL the messianic prophesies in 1 life time, before he dies, and he will not be worshiped as God or the son of God.     Jesus was a mortal man not a God, not the son of God, and he is not the promised messiah.     Christianity is the only religion that says if you don't accept their teaching and beliefs and accept Jesus as your lord and savior you will burn in hell for all eternity, they are WRONG there are many paths to God not just one.     Every other religion out there and every other person out there OTHER THAN a Christian following Christianity all believe that God will judge each and every person on what kind of life they led. Except of course for the people who don't believe in any God.     Contrary to what you will be told by any Christian   YOU CAN BE NON-CHRISTIAN AND STILL GET INTO HEAVEN.     Isaiah 40:25) "To whom can you liken me that I should be his equal?"      Isaiah 43:11) "I, only I, am God and there is no deliverer aside from me"     Isaiah 45:5) "I am God and there is no other; other than me there is no God."     Isaiah 45:21) There is no other god besides Me: there is no righteous god besides Me and no savior other than Me.     Isaiah 45:22) Turn to Me and be saved all ends of the earth, for I am God and there is no other.     The NT simply can not be believed by anyone who has the will to search for the truth with an OPEN MIND.|`|AA12377597	The Bible says G-d is the first and the last, meaning He has no father, and He has no son.     It also says one man cannot die for anyone's sins, and that you are the one who should get rid of the sin. It says this when Moses asks G-d to kill him as a sacrifice when Israel worships the golden calf.    Another thing. G-d says He is NOT man. Nor will he take the form of a man.    The Shema states the Lord is One. And only One.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	Just pick up a bible and begin reading the new testament and you will find your answers. Basically Jesus is the SON of God, the only son. In following his teachings you reach God. The teachings are those of God, found in the old testament. Basically the old testament was full of bumbling humans who really p$$ed the big GUY off, and it was full of sacrifices and things to try to teach humans to follow the teachings he gave to Moses and Isaiah. God sent his son so that the bumbling humans could properly learn the true teachings of God rather than the warped version that was being practised by the Jews. Jesus took a human form and when he was baptized he became recognized by the chosen few who followed him. When he prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane he was about to face the end of his human life, his spirit was going to leave his beloved on earth and go to God where he would be seated at the right side of his father. This of course was a transition to be endured. He felt pain, he was in human form, and in the flesh he felt the pain, and in his spirit he felt the pain of all humankind, for he suffered all of it. Every day, consider reading a little of Luke, Mark or whatever appeals to you. The lessons and insights will be interpreted through your unique perspective and will be your own take on Jesus.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	He was the Son of God, created in God his Father (Elohim) image as we are.|`|WalnRzfGaa	"God is a trinity of persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

They are three distinct persons; yet, they are all the one God. Each has a will, can speak, can love, etc., and these are demonstrations of personhood. They are in absolute perfect harmony consisting of one substance. They are coeternal, coequal, and copowerful.

Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'? 10Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me?

Jesus NEVER claimed to be God.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	The whole point of the story is that the spirit of God dwells in all of us, but we need to learn how to feel it and receive the guidance of the spirit.    The trinity comes from the old Roman trinity of Jupiter (the Father), Mars (the Son), and Minerva (the Holy Mother), as well as the Egyptian trinity of Osiris, Horus, and Isis. They represent the power of matter (the Father), joining with the power of spirit (Mother), to create Man (the Son). Every other Mediterranean religion had a Trinity of Father, Mother, and Son.    P.S. Most Christians are liars, even the earliest writers admitted it, that they lied and tried to hide the truth, that Christianity derives from the old pagan Mysteries. That is why they are giving me TD's, because they don't know anything about their own history.

There isn't a single New Testament writer that focuses on the concept of the 'trinity' at any great length as if it were an important teaching to embrace.    The idea of the 'trinity' is nothing more than an observation regarding the nature and character of God.  When God created the heaven and the earth, it is "Elohim" that is credited with the act.  "Elohim" is a Hebrew plural word that is accepted as expressing 3 or more.      The holiest teaching of the Torah (the books written by Moses) is The Shema - "Hear Oh Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One" . . . not three.  Yet God clearly manifests himself by his spirit.  Jesus himself more than once claimed to be one with God.  He didn't say he was "two" with God, or "three" with God and the Holy Spirit, he said he was "one" with God.    So God isn't three.  God is one.  As men with a temporal perspective, we have seen God manifest as a spirit and we have seen God manifest in the flesh.  But it isn' three Gods, it's one God.  It's our perspective that wants to separate what we perceive into smaller, more digestible pieces.  It's not God that is divided.|`|iHDYncuXaa	God in the flesh.|`|XN0cYCATaa	God is a trinity of persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

Almighty God CREATED Jesus, this is what the Bible teaches.     Note the following Bible verses that show clearly and logically that Jesus and God are separate and distinct individuals:    Matthew 16:15, 16 (this is Jesus speaking to his apostles about who he is): "He said to them: "You, though, who do you say I am?" In answer, Simon Peter said: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." - (Right away, Jesus own close apostles and disciples knew that Jesus was not God himself. They knew him to be a separate, subordinate being in relation to the Almighty God.)    Revelation 3:14 (talking about Jesus) describes him as "the beginning of the creation by God". - (So one that is created by another is never equal to the one that created them. It plainly says that God started his creation with Jesus.)    John 20:31 (this verse is right after the account where Jesus appeared before Thomas) says: "But these have been written down that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and that, because of believing, you may have life by means of his name." (Again, that experience shows that Jesus' own apostles knew Jesus to be God's son, and NOT God himself.)    John 20:17 (Jesus appeared before Mary Magdalene after his death and resurrection): "Jesus said to her: 'Stop clinging to me. For I have not yet ascended to the Father. But be on your way to my brothers and say to them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God'." - (So very clearly, Jesus told Mary that when he returned to heaven, he would be returning before the god that they worshipped and that HE worshipped as well. Jesus and his followers worshipped the same god.....again demonstrating that Jesus himself is NOT God.)    John 14:28 (Jesus clearly makes the distinction between himself and Almighty God) says: "You heard that I said to you, I am going away and I am coming (back) to you. If you loved me you would rejoice that I am going my way to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am." - (Again, Jesus reiterates that he is lesser than his Father. The Father, God, the one who sent Jesus to the earth, is superior to Jesus and therefore, NOT Jesus.)    John 1:34 (the testimony of John the Baptizer): "And I have seen (it), and I have borne witness that this one is the Son of God." - John, the one who baptized Jesus in the Jordan and heard God's voice from heaven offers his truthful testimony to the fact that Jesus is NOT God, but God's Son.)    Mark 5:7 (the account of Jesus encountering a demon-possessed man who lived among the caves and memorial tombs. Notice what the demons said when Jesus approached:) "and, when he had cried out with a loud voice, he said: "What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I put you under oath by God not to torment me." - (Again, take note that the demons, enemies of God and Jesus, fully acknowledged the fact that Jesus is God's Son and NOT that Jesus was God himself. Ask yourself......if the demons, who had once been angels in heaven in Jesus' presence and God's presence, will acknowledge the fact that Jesus and God are not the same, how can anyone else contradict that?)    Matthew 28:18: "And Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying "All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth." - (Again, think about it.....Jesus had to be GIVEN that authority, meaning he didn't have it before. And he had to be GIVEN that authority from someone superior to him who had it to give. That superior person was God. Thus, again, Jesus is not and was not God.)    Mark 13:32 (in reference to knowledge of the time when this system of things will end): "Concerning that day or the hour nobody knows, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but the Father." - (So clearly, if the Father knows something that the Son does not, obviously Jesus is not God and not equal to God.)    Revelation 1:1 says: "A revelation by Jesus Christ, which God gave him, to show his slaves the things that must shortly take place. And he sent forth his angel and presented (it) in signs through him to his slave John," - (And yet one more time, there's a chain of individuals that John's revelation came through before it reached him. The topmost was from Almighty God himself, who gave it to Jesus, who passed it to an angel, who delivered it to John. Again, this shows very clearly that Jesus is NOT God. If Jesus were God, then he would have received that revelation from himself, and so that scripture wouldn't have made any sense.)    Acts 7:55 (just before the martyr Stephen was stoned to death, he saw a vision of heaven): "But he, being full of holy spirit, gazed into heaven and caught sight of God's glory and of Jesus standing at God's right hand," - (Yet again, he sees Jesus as standing at God's side, at God's favored position, separate and distinct from God himself. He clearly saw two separate and distinct individuals.)    (NOTE) - Some will try and use John 10:31 "I and the father are one" to try and prove that Jesus is God. But again, careful consideration of the verse, the context, and even Jesus' words further on in the book of John in John 17:21, 22 shows that "I and the father are one" DOES NOT equal "The father and I are the same person". And why is that? At John 17:21, 22, Jesus prayed regarding his followers: That they may all be one, and he added, that they may be one even as we are one. He used the same Greek word (hen) for one in all these instances. Obviously, Jesus disciples do not all become part of the Trinity. But they do come to share a oneness of purpose with the Father and the Son, the same sort of oneness that unites God and Christ.|`|rg4lS9E9aa	God is Jesus father and Jesus was created in the image of God and has many of his fine personality traits,but they are two seperate beings.|`|61fe545ae98d416c70ed3a3245764042aa	God is indeed a triune being. We won't be able to understand everything about God or how He can exist as three distinct (yet ontologically equal) persons ... but, we can see in Scripture that He is. We also can't limit ourselves to the Old Testament because we, as Christians, are given additional revelation as to who God is in the New Testament. God is revealed to us as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Each is identified as God in Scripture and yet each is depicted as being distinct one from the other (i.e., the Father is not the Son, the Son is not the Father, and the Holy Spirit is neither the Father or the Son). From this we derive that God is a single being who exists as three distinct persons. When it comes to Jesus' prayers, we need to take into account that Jesus is a distinct person from the Father so we should expect to see communication occurring between the two & that Jesus became a man and thus had a God as every man does & prayed to this God.|`|41ISfvXmaa	Jesus is 100% God.

Confession is not truthful if you knowingly admit your wrongful actions while fully planning to either keep sinning, or if you plan to ignore an opportunity to repair what you damaged.  <br>  <br>  If you damaged another person's reputation by lying,  you should do whatever is reasonably possible to repair that person's reputation.  Tell the people to whom you lied that you lied, and tell the truth to everyone who might still believe your original lie.   We can not reasonably expect the Peace of forgiveness when we knowingly and willfully allow the damage done by our offenses to continue uncorrected.   This pertains to the Catholic concept of Penance.<br>  <br>  I think you would enjoy reading the Catechism of The Catholic Church.<br>  It deals very much with repenting, confessing, and being truly reconciled.<br>  <br>  I am praying for your Peace as I write this.<br>  Peace be with you.|`|kF9aHWfUaa	Say sorry and let your left hand shake your right hand.|`|7gpAdJGaaa	HELP SOMEONE|`|0PvpGjSqaa	you have to give yourself permission to move on. if someone else has chosen to let it go, what are you getting out of holding onto it?

I frankly don't care if you "forgive yourself."  What's that going to do for you?  You are in Religion & Spirituality.  Unless you are your own one-person religion, your forgiveness of your sin is completely irrelevent.  <br>  <br>  The question is ... do you believe in Jesus Christ?  If so, HE forgives you.  Now ... if you truly beileve that Jesus is the Son of God.  If you truly believe that Jesus died for your sins.  If you truly believe that you are forgiven by Christ then you SHOW your belief (AKA faith) by letting go of your sin.  That's not the same as forgiving yourself, but it's akin to it.  If you keep dwelling on a sin even after you say you believe that Christ forgave you then it's sort of an insult to Jesus, don't you think?  Christ said on the cross: "It is finished."  EVERY sin that He died for is finished.

I would not recommend taking this to the boss right away - makes you a whiner and snitch which other employees will not like.

AA11693263	Although she was being rude by 1. talking loudly on her phone and 2. monopolizing the television while on the phone, you could have handled it differently. Especially since you are the "new kid on the block". You could have avoided a situation that could now cause you grief everyday if you would have just politely asked her if she minded if you changed the channel while she was on the phone. She might have been more receptive to that instead of you just changing it and then telling her what she needs to do. Even if you have been there for a long time and again you still think she is rude, it doesn't give you the right to be rude back. She is probably just as angry at you and thinks you are the rude one and now there is going to be tension between the two of you. I know that if someone who just started working with me talked to me like you did to her it would make me angry at the person. I know you probably don't like my answer but you really didn't have the right to tell her that you "don't work that way". Whether you like it or not, the bottom line is that she was there first. First at the job and first in the break room. If watching television is that important to you then try to schedule you breaks to where no one else will be in there or to at least get there first.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	I would've just let her be, say oh sorry and turned it back and found something else to do...maybe go outside to get fresh air or something...you don't want to already start making enemies|`|po85q148aa	I would have done the same thing.

You want to fix this since it is your third day in the job and the opinions of others are an important matter during your first month, because is by your peers that your boss gets the info on how well you are doing. <br>  I would talk to her next time you see her and just make small talk. Say something along the lines of: Hey I can't believe I acted that way the other day, I am usually a pretty calm person. Lets put this behind us and continue. By the way, what is your favorite show?

wVet0QXVaa	I don't think abandoning God would be the right choice.  I would think that you would hope that they would eventually follow your example and turn to God.

So were the Inquisitors. So was Hitler. See a pattern? Go ahead...."train" your kids in the "Way, the Truth, and the Light." (While you're at it, look into the Graeco-Egyptian Magical Papyri...you'll see those words there as well....BEFORE the time of Christ.....oh, and look up some of the religious iconography in Christianity....the fish, the ***, the Yule Tree, the Easter Bunny, the Cross, the Resurrection, the "Virgin" Mary.....if you go back to pre-Christian religion, I'm certain you'll find each one of those). But, back to what I was saying. Brainwash yet another child into your sadistic cult. Please! I really want you to. I would love to see you kill of your religion :). Oh, if you disagree with my use of the term "cult" think of the phrase "One man's god is another's devil," and think about it. Despite the fact that I find it highly erotic, the Crucifixion is a rather morbid symbol of "Immortality." I'm also fairly certain that your child will find Jesus' hanging limply from a tree just as sexy as I do....but they'll never admit it, so they'll probably end up killing a person who looks like their mother (sexual repression's a b****).  FREE WILL B****!!!!|`|mOaG5ueZaa	To atheists, if your child rebuked Evolution and wanted to become a Christian, would you join them in their faith?<br>  <br>  We can't abandon our faith just because a family member doesn't see it as truth.|`|1e2a6fa5fb61da506030373affea1905aa	I wouldn't go to hell for ANYONE.

AA10494763	in  the eyes of the law no.  they are not entitled to the rights of marriage like property or even the right to make medical decisions.|`|pGf4mIw9aa	Who married off Adam and Eve?|`|wVet0QXVaa	Well, in North America, you hear about a lot of highschoolers who want to have sex say that "they took their vows before God and each other".  It's cute, but it isn't really culturally or spiritually sanctioned.  I mean, usually it's just the two of them since their parents and community are against it.  It also tends not to really work out in the long run.  <br>  <br>  I don't think marriage is about the piece of paper, but generally, if a couple is not able to get a legal marriage, it isn't culturally or spiritually sanctioned.  That's really the purpose of the legal aspect, to recognize that sanction.  I'd love to say that yes, in their heart of hearts it is the same, but of the teenage couples I've seen do this, only one ever actually got married.  The others had sex and then broke up.  The "marriage" was really only an excuse to have sex.  It seems as though the most sincere people realized that they could wait for the real time, or else did not kid themselves and call it a marriage.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I'm sure this is not the answer that you wanted.  I'm not judging you on wanting to have pre-marital sex, but at least be real with yourself about the situation.|`|495e344229dc3bcc5dcbf3cd52fed97eaa	It's a real marriage in the eyes of the church, and not a real marriage in the eyes of the state. Some churches (Quakers, for example) do not consider that the state has any business being involved in marriages, and so only have the religious marriage. Some people have Justice of the Peace weddings which are real in the eyes of the state but not in the eyes of the church.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Marriage isn't legal until the state says so.<br>  <br>  Legal and "real" are two different things, depending on the context.|`|uJO0MbShaa	In Canada it's considered a legal partnership called "common law."|`|c190ccb4380d3da6626ff820eb61dbd8aa	yes there is a name for this,but i can't remember it.but GOD will hold the two accountable. if either want out.
EWFtcMAxaa	Sam Lee<br>  Beau Lee (pronounced 'bow' as in a ribbon)<br>  Spencer Lee<br>  Logan Lee<br>  Eric Lee<br>  Gavin Lee<br>  Frankie Lee|`|0tXcfq0waa	I prefer the name Sean..it sounds cool and it's English!:)|`|Ov83HJEFaa	Sunny?<br>  Sebastien?|`|RGe6Et0Xaa	"Lee" is a common first name in English. If you want to stick to something close to the original, you could go with that.<br>  <br>  It is kind of funny, "Bae Lee" is really close to "Bailey," which is a common last name in English. "Seung" isn't really close to any common English names, but you could go with something like "Sam."<br>  <br>  "Sunny" is a really good suggestion for your first name.|`|rVqFTqCdaa	if your name is Seung -why does your name say sarang in korean?or were you writing ? ? ? ?? ...<br>  <br>  isnt Seung ?? ...or close to that??<br>  <br>  I agree with other people Sean sounds like a good name :)|`|RXvZvnJHaa	Jimmy Phipps.|`|hJgCZKg9aa	I agree with some of the others, Sean would be nice.|`|mhK8opC7aa	Yeah, I like Sean Lee.|`|zopegiT4aa	how about Samuel Lee?
