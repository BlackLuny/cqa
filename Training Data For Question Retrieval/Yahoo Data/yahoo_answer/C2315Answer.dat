For example, I might think about what it is that I like best about 4H. Or I might pick a television show that I really like that is related to 4H. Or, if I might pick a a book, a newspaper, or a magazine article that I'm interested in that's related to 4H.<br>  <br>  Once I've chosen one or more items that I'm interested in that can be related to 4H, I'll ask myself to name three reasons why I'm interested in it. <br>  <br>  Then I'm ready to write my speech. I'll write a couple of paragraphs about each of the three reasons. Then it's just a matter of writing the opening and the closing. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps!|`|bHnF8rdRaa	Why don't you give a speech about going green?

tGaHEV6Daa	Crikey people are being particularly mean in answering your question. Don't worry we all go through bad phases, especially in school. It doesn't mean you're thick, you probably just didn't realise how important they were at the time and couldn't get the help you needed. So people shoudln't be so rude.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I think it's going to have to be a case of starting over I'm afraid. You will need to get some qualifications which you can either do by attending a local college or by doing something online such as ICS where you study by yourself at home. Personally I would try the first option as if you've been away from studying for a while you will probably need the help of a tutor. What you can do is have a look at the NHS website to see what is required of a midwife and how you go about becoming one. Then you can decide if it's really the career for you. <br>  <br>  I would also suggest going to your local college and asking to speak to an advisor there, they can help you decide with what you have got, what courses you can do to help you as there are tons of courses that can point you in the direction of midwifery.<br>  <br>  So basically my advice is get some thorough research in about a midwifery career and then go and speak to a student advisor about what to do and then get applying, Unfortunately it is going to take time to acheive it, and it's unlikely you will become a midwife until you're about 30 or so, but if you really want it there's no reason why you can't get it. Everyone deserves a second chance.|`|LwywrSRkaa	You can go back to college and redo your GCSE's there are many colleges that are for school leavers. At the same time they do A-Levels, degrees and so on. =) You at least need 5 A*-C grades including maths, English and science, health and social care too if you can. Then you have to go on to do your A-Levels in biology and health and social care. If you can't afford uni then don't let that stop you! There are so many people out there who can't and nowadays there is more financial support for people. Remember that you still need to reconsider it if you do it because it is a demanding job and you need to know what you're letting yourself in for, but I am sure you will learn about that in college. Good luck! =)|`|MINy26pjaa	Go back to school.  You need to put in the effort to actually learn, and get decent grades. <br>  <br>   When you deliver a child you have both the baby's life and the mother's life in your hands if something unexpected happens.  If you don't even care enough to work hard and study, then why would anyone trust you enough to put lives in your hands?  <br>  <br>  And if you aren't SURE that you could cope with a demanding job then this isn't the job for you.  What if you found yourself in an emergency situation and found out you just couldn't cope?  People could die.  Babies could be damaged for life!<br>  <br>  I think it might be best if you didn't consider this a good career for yourself.|`|HWojJn0qaa	Yes you can! I know people who have done it. You can take an access course which you don't need any qualifications for <a href="http://www.accesstohe.ac.uk/home/publications/caseStudies/studentguide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstohe.ac.uk/home/publica...</a> <br>  This takes about a year to complete then from this you can take a midwifery course. I would try to find a careers advisor to help you plan things and with applications if you decide to do it. <br>  Best of luck!|`|CMsceWkUaa	Nevermind you not being able to afford uni, you wouldn't of got into college with those grades!<br>  To start the ball rolling, you'd need some decent qualifications.

"Their" is plural and "one" is singular.<br>  <br>   "A doctor could easily get annoyed and talk someone into assisted suicide" (In my opinion, doctors should NOT talk someone into this. It is against the Hippocratic oath, which all doctors MUST take to get a license to practice, and which a major line goes "I will keep them from harm and injustice." (3rd paragraph in the ancient wording of it) and the <br>   6th paragraph of the modern version has this: " Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God."  In other words--FIRST,  DO NO HARM.<br>  <br>   Talking someone into committing suicide is playing God because the doctor would literally have someone's life or death in his/her hands. I'm sure they get annoyed , like anyone else, but this is something that no one should do. Why do you think Jack Kevorkian got into all those court cases and ended up in prison?

The Earth revolves around the sun, while the moon revolves around the Earth.<br>  <br>  2)  For starters, the size.  The Earth is way bigger in comparison!  Also, here on Earth, we have the atmosphere full of clouds and weather patterns.  The moon doesn't have an atmosphere like that.  And finally, Earth is a planet full of live, while no creatures live on the moon!<br>  <br>  3)  As the name implies, a gas _giant_ is very large!  Take Jupiter for instance:  It is the biggest planet in our solar system!  Most of the size though, comes from the second characteristic and that is the atmosphere.

63c6ad890d0828ff609c53ea0a1378e0aa	Well first of all, it is nice to be paid attention to. I mean teachers do all this lesson preparation, and then look back, and see five girls looking down at their laps, not paying attention to what the teacher is saying, she knows they are texing each other, but when she calls a name, the girl looks up and the first thing she says, is.  "I don't have a phone". The teacher knows she is lieing, and gets two minutes of attention from the girl and again the girl is looking at her lap. Now you don't sound like this example. So I would suggest you,<br>  Pay attention<br>  Ask and answer Questions<br>  Do your homework on time<br>  Be polite<br>  Dress for school, not a party<br>  And Yes, teachers do have eyes in the back of their head, they know when students are talking, when their back is turned.<br>  Don't be afraid to ask for clarification after the class is finished.<br>  And do not plagiarize, so many students copy their homework verbatim from the computer. Try to make your homework interesting, if you write a paper, it should stand out. Be neat, no word cross outs, no erasure marks.Lets say you are doing an article on a scientist, if you can include a picture of him, from an old magazine, it is nice to add it to your report, means you have really been studying.<br>  My daughter teaches in New York, some of her students are gang members, but she says if she can reach just one student and be responsible for that student going on to College and trying to better himself, or herself, it will all have been worth it.<br>  After the school year, last year, she had one girl write her a short note, saying she had enjoyed my daughter's class, and thanking her. Now of course my daughter showed it to all the other teachers at the next teachers meeting. I asked, do you think she hoped you would do that, and that the other teacher might take note of the girl, when they had her in their class rooms. My daughter answered, 'You bet she knew, and it worked'.|`|1Dshgmywaa	I don't know what you mean by what do teachers "look for in a student." Generally, if one is a good teacher, he or she wants all of the students to succeed in some way.<br>  <br>  I notice all my students. It's hard at times to ALWAYS acknowledge everyone at the same time (and probably impossible), especially if there are certain kids who talk more OR certain kids with behavioral problems that create distractions.<br>  <br>  I do notice when students seem "unwell." You get a knack for that after a while--noticing "symptoms" of a kid having trouble.<br>  <br>  I say, if you feel transparent or under-acknowledged, talk to your teacher before or after class to get more acquainted with them. In college, I would always meet with professors whom I thought seemed abrasive in class. I wanted to get to know them on a different level in order to really benefit in class. <br>  <br>  So yeah, talk to your teacher--establish a connection. You'll probably learn better as well, given the teacher is good at his/her job.|`|rSfoEyE3aa	Well im Transparent In Business class but in every other subject im the one thats picked first.Some teachers like to pick the smart students the ones that arnt shy to ask questions or afraid incase she snaps.Others would rather pick the students that are show offs ,bullys and most noticable.Teachers are Hay wire i was told i need to break out of my shell by my Business teacher but shes a stress head and at times your counting the seconds for the bell to ring.But with other teachers all i want to do is answer questions and be noticed.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Well, all teachers are not created equal, but most teachers look for students that work hard, keep up with assignments, participate in class, and treat them (and others) with respect. No more. No less.|`|EQl8af0Waa	they are looking for the best in you that's all I can tell you I hope that works.|`|3FfPHRGtaa	all teachers (at least those i know) always try to bear in mind that all students are equal. so they try not to show favourtism. i notice that teachers pay more attention students who are more pro-active, responsible and amicable. and naturally, ppl tend to like others who they find attractive, regardless of their sexuality. so more attention is paid to those lucky ones.<br>  <br>  teachers are only human. they have their kids, their husband and many more family members. they have the same problems your parents do. and on top of that, they have 1000 more kids to take care of and ALL their homework to mark. their list is simply endless. so its unreasonble to expect a teacher to make the extra effort to know all her students.  and think about this way: would you tend to like an energetic or quiet teacher, sexy or...chubby? energetic and sexy right? same thing applies for teachers.<br>  <br>  teachers do notice the transparent ones once in a while. when a student looks like he isnt well, teachers might notice it but keep quiet. when he looks like he need to go home, then they ask him. but i guess some cases go unnoticed. if a students has some extreme quirks, that might be noticed. if a student act differently, like has a habit of shaking her legs, you will probably notice her too. cos there will be someone in class who looks weird 'vibrating'. lol. and yes, they know it when you gossip about them. they just dont show it.<br>  <br>  =]
trKgx3Ukaa	Hi mate, <br>  <br>  The idea is that you get yourself an apprenticeship first and then enrol in the Cert III course. I don't know in what state you are in, but many states have some organizations which assist people looking for an apprenticeship. Do a search on google for your particular state to find these organizations. <br>  <br>  They will get you in touch with employers who are looking for apprentice brikkies. They don't expect you to know any bricklaying at that stage, but will introduce you to it as you work for them, and you will learn the rest from your Cert III course that you will be doing alongside your apprenticeship. <br>  <br>  Your employer will give you block release to attend TAFE as required. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

I made a few small changes but maintained your writing style. I love this paper - you are very lucky to have such a great family?<br>  <br>  My definition of a symbol is an object that has great significance to a person. My grandparent’s house is an important symbol to me since it signifies, memories, comfort, fun, love and respect. <br>  <br>  My grandparent’s house is a place for both sad and happy *memories. Some of the memories I remember are that it is the last place I saw my great grandpa before he passed away. It is where I witnessed my nana’s 96th birthday; it’s the first place I saw my nephews and cousins, and it is where I last saw my sister before she went to Iraq. <br>  <br>  I receive *comfort when my family gets together to celebrate things. We celebrate birthdays, the Eagles, holidays, and graduations, to name a few things. When we’re celebrating, we usually have a big dinner with some macaroni and cheese, candy yams, chicken, corn bread, spinach, potato salad, and a lot of desserts. To start our day we all gather around the living for prayer. <br>  <br>  I have *fun at my grandparents’ house when we get together to watch the Eagles, Phillis, and the Sixers play. I also have fun when we play monopoly, connect four, life, and charades, or when we go outside to play football, kickball, or baseball. <br>  <br>  Everyone shows *love and respect for one another at my grandparent’s house. We show our love by getting together on Sundays. We show our respect by following the rules. Some of the rules are that we have to eat all the food on our plate, clean up after ourselves, no cursing, etc. <br>  <br>  My grandparent’s house is a place of memories, comfort, love, fun, love and respect.  The symbols their home represents have shaped my life and I would not be the same person without them.

AA10140333	Hopefully you already know the events of the revolution, so I'm not going to recap on those. What you should remember is how the last dynasty, the Qing dynasty, of China came to an end. Sun Yat-sen tried to form a revolution, but it ended up mainly as a collapse of old order. Thus, the Qing dynasty came to a screeching halt and a new political system was ready to take its place. <br>  <br>  After the fall of the last dynasty, it somewhat created a domino effect. Similar traditional empires around the world came to an end, mainly because of the Western concept of imperialism. For example, Russia's tsarist society, the Austro-Hungrian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire came to an end a few years after the fall of the Qing. <br>  <br>  Back to the Euro empires. The Austro-Hungrian's demise was torn apart by the winning allies of WWI, which was "directly linked to the fate tsarist Russia." Nonetheless, these empires were bound to fail because of their resistance to change. If they had industrialized and and reformed their governments without hesitation, they could have be saved. However, "everything comes too late for those who only wait.”<br>  <br>  *Please don't think I plagiarized. Some of it was obviously taken from the text, but most of it was my rephrasing. And sorry that it's so long. >_<

I only read this SAT guide, and that is how I got such high scores:<br>  <a href="http://www.guideparadise.com/index.php?option=com_guides&task=buy&id=6" rel="nofollow">http://www.guideparadise.com/index.php?o...</a><br>  I recommend this guide to anyone seeking to get a higher score to get into a first choice college.|`|82adc9de8b84e2d5739e034dbb398f84aa	Either is fine, but I think the SAT is more widely used (but not by much).<br>  <br>  It's good to take it now if you have a chance so you know where your strengths and weaknesses are.  This will let you know what to study for before you take it again for college.<br>  <br>  I've never heard anyone regretting taking it so early.|`|4346636b07c0341c80a71ed1471cf837aa	For a seventh grade student to take either would be a waste of money.  Until you are within two years of graduation, there isn't any point -- even if you have the potential to score very highly.<br>  <br>  In fact, if you are capable of a high score, your time and money would be better spent accelerating through high school.  <br>  <br>  WHEN you are within two years of graduation, you would want to consider the college you would most like to attend.  Colleges in the mid-west prefer to see the ACT.  Others prefer the SAT.  Start researching college before making that choice.  If your college of choice doesn't have a preference, take the ACT -- statistically it's the one with which female students score higher.

The Articles of Confederation were meant to put States' Rights over the rights of the National Government.<br>  In addition the Articles: omitted some important clauses which are needed in any contractual relationship; did not account sufficiently for the different populations and wealth of the member States; and included, in highly unalterable form, several items which would clearly need to be altered with time as the world changed.<br>  <br>  http://ap_history_online.<br>  tripod.com/apush8.html|`|1a9e4d57320cb7594a39fb95ad34cf07aa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|AA10147224	Weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation<br>  <br>  o Congress did not have the power to levy or collect taxes, and government owed money to foreign government and soldiers who fought during the revolutionary war.<br>  o Congress did not have the power to regulate trade, creating a lot of disputes between states.<br>  o Congress could not enforce to obey the laws it passed, rather it can only advise and request the states to comply.<br>  o Laws needed approval from 9 out of 13 states, which caused a problem to impose new legislation for there were not enough members present in the congress.<br>  o Amending the Articles needed all states approval, and for that it was never amended. <br>  o Lack of an executive branch made it difficult to enforce the laws Congress passed, and there was no unity and no way to coordinate in legislative procedures.<br>  o There were no national court system, and thus states courts were responsible for interpretation of the national laws, making it more difficult to settle the disputes among the states.
6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	If you apply to any UC campus then yes, they will know you previously attended before as the systems are all linked.  And if you didn't specify that on the application then you can be automatically rejected as you falsified your application (all applications require you to list all post-secondary schools you attended).<br>  <br>  For other schools, if you applied for any financial aid then that too will be available info to know where you previously attended.   Again, a falsified application is grounds for rejection.<br>  <br>  Community colleges by the way don't care what your past grades were as they are open admissions.  The only stumbling block would be the transfer to a 4 year where a minimum GPA might be required.  But if you do well enough 2 years at a CC then you should have more than a good enough transfer GPA so I wouldn't worry about it.|`|ELkprAhPaa	Hey mate i'm doing the same thing..!<br>  <br>  Well worst came to worst and i missed the half of the semester of my secondary school.

Community schools are quite easy to get into but yo may need to start half-time. I applied to a university as a freshman and they wanted transcripts from schools I never told them I had attended, so they can find out. You should have talked to somebody last semester after the incident and gotten an incomplete. You could have resumed the classes or made up the work to pass. This semester, go talk to a counselor at the school and explain the situation. It may not be too late to salvage this year and the counselor can lay out your options.

y4yVmcOVaa	I've been to three different school's in my college days so far.<br>  <br>  Generally, school's won't let you switch room mates unless there are serious problems. This is because if people switch around constantly there are a lot of problems that can arise like mail, and some safety concerns like knowing where to find someone if there is an emergency.<br>  <br>  I have never came across a school that would not let you change room mates if there were serious problems.  However, every school has different circumstances that are allowable. In one school I've been to, students often changed rooms because one person would stay up all night, enjoy drinking, or just not get along with them. At the university I am in now, problems must almost be violent to justify change.<br>  <br>  Really though, most people are very nice. Of all the room mates I've had, I can't say that I've had any that were really bad for me. Nobody is perfect, but a room mate is an opportunity for a friend.<br>  <br>   If you have questions, you should contact your potential college and and let them know about your concerns.

b576159c19fb7fafb14aaff18f035be8aa	It's all about dehumanization and creation of an "us versus them" mentality.<br>  <br>  The Hitler-like character in Lord of the Flies is Jack. Jack rallies the other boys around him by showing off his strength. Once Jack has the loyalty of all of the boys of the island except for Piggy, Simon, and the twins, he creates a mentality for the other boys that Piggy, Simon, and the twins are outcasts and brainwashes them into thinking that they are the enemy, just because they are different. He turns them into savages based off of their hatred of Piggy, Simon and the twins - and in the end, Piggy is murdered and the boys try to kill Simon. They capture and torture the twins. <br>  <br>  This draws a parallel to Adolf Hitler. Hitler was like Jack in that he rallied the Germans around him by accusing the Jews of being the enemy. He convinced the Germans that since Jews kept to themselves and acted like outsiders, they should be killed. The Germans became like the savage boys under Hitler and they seemed to lose their reason and concentrated on killing the Jews. This dehumanization of the Jews is like the mentality that Jack created toward Simon, Piggy, and the twins. <br>  <br>  These is another idea I thought of, but I'm not sure if it's foolproof:<br>  Piggy is like the Jews that were murdered.<br>  The twins are like the Jews in the concentration camps.<br>  Simon is like the Jews that escaped.<br>  <br>  Just an idea.<br>  Hope I helped.|`|AA11446059	Zoinks.  It's been like 15 years since I read Lord of the Flies, but I'll try to get you started.  <br>  <br>  The main focus will be the comparison and contrast between Hitler and Jack.  <br>  <br>  One of the main similarities is how Jack refuses to recognize Ralph as the democratically chosen leader.  <br>  <br>  Further, you have the exploitation and de-humanization of those who are "different" or "genetically inferior."  Hitler was all about eugenics, and he would view Piggy as inferior and not worthy of life, just as Jack did.<br>  <br>  Ironically, at the end, the troops come in and save the day.  This could be similarly compared to the liberation of the concentration camps, where humans were degraded to inhuman levels.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

Uneducated people generally die earlier than educated people. <br>  <br>  This may seem like a farfetched assertion, but studies on life expectancy and mortality rates have shown that an increase in education directly corresponds to a decrease in death. The nation's population usually becomes more sustainable as well, since there are less births. <br>  <br>  Increased literacy rates = increased life expectancy.|`|1493b837bb109ad3870278e202d37b9caa	Countries with low literacy are generally less educated.<br>  <br>  Less educated countries generally have worse healthcare.<br>  <br>  Threfore, countries with low literacy rates can not take care of their citizens as well as educated countries so the life expectancies in these countries are low.

Currently, the earth is running out of resources to provide for its people, such as oil for producing electricity, therefore we have to provide an alternative way, which in the text suggests HEP method. Due to global warming, alternative energy sources are beginning to fail on us as well, as the text doubts the ability of the three gorges dam to generate power.<br>  Global warming is a continuous cycle that will continue to affect mankind if we do not treasure what we have now and have no love for mankind. The problem should be tackled as soon as possible, to save ourselves and our later generations.

But that's in the UC system and the arts they focus on is dance. To be honest I don't think you will find a Cal State university that will fully suit your needs. Sorry :(<br>  <br>  But to answer your question on transfer vs starting as a freshmen the difference is financial and also what you are expecting from your college experience. If your looking for the high school experience then apply to a University as a freshmen. If you have other things going on in your life like a family or a really good job and you want to save a little money, then do the second-year transfer.  Many schools guarantee admission for transfers (just make sure the classes you take are transferable to the school your interested in). And make sure your school of interest guarantees admission for transfers. When you get your degree, employers aren't going to know/care if you did the full 4 year thing vs the transfer option.

When Napoleon invaded Spain it left open the door for revolutions in central ans south america. England and France went scrambling for a piece of the pie of the spanish colonies. The Us was too weak of a country to compete. In the spanish colonies where three kinds of people, the people felt spanish and wanted to defend the King these people where white and where of the upper classes and the military, there were those who were part of the intellectual class, and theser were mostly white with some few mestizos, these people favored a democracy a la French Revolution. Ad then there was the common folk who didnt know what the hell was going on, these people were poor uneducated whites, mestizos, indians and black, they were the ones who died in the battlefieds on both sides during the wars of independence. <br>  Meanwhile France and England through freemasonry got in contact with the royalists and independentists. Since Spain was invaded by France and England was fighting on the side of the royalist spanish, the first group sided with england. Freemasonry poured money and know how for the american independence cause in the Gran Colombia and Simon Bolivar became the military head. In the Chile the british through their Irish agents became pro british. In Buenos Aires the british killed the intellectual head of the independentists Maniano Moreno. The crown invited Moreno to London and the Captain of the ship poisoned Moreno a few days after leaving port, dumping the body somewhere in the atlantic ocean. French masonry sent San Martin to fight the revolution against Spain, but since Buenos aires was already in hands of the royalists and the british he had no luck there. Castelli and Belgrano allies of Moreno were neutrilized. Castelli was dying of cancer and Belgrano was sent to a suicide mission against the royalists from peru in the north. Belgrano was a true patriot, but his husband (he was gay) was a british officer, and many believe he was tactically neutralized by this fact. <br>  San Martin ended up in Mendoza a Chilean outpost across the andes. He raised an army among the poor whitesm meztizos and black and conducted one of the greates feats in military world history. he crosses the andes and took his army to Chile. There without any choice he had to accept british help to reach peru. Then in ecuador San Martin and Bolivar meet and since Bolivar was of a higher masonic degree and english vs french). Even though Frenchmasonry did not recognize english masonry San Martin had no backing and left Simon Bolivar as the head of all the armies. San Martin died in Bolong sur Mer France of old age. <br>  <br>  In years prior to the invasion of spain by france, england has tried to invade buenos aires two times but were humilated in battle. even though the local aristocracy favored the british, the common people raised in arms and delt humilating blows to the invading english and the scottish.   <br>  <br>  When all was said and done. The Us felt threatened with a growing seudo british empire as its neighbor. The monroe doctrine ws born not only out of this political necessity, but also based on a racial and religious caracted of the United States. The american ruling class saw itself as gods chosen people with the destiny to rule this whole continent. <br>  At that time it was a pipedream. The Us had no power and the french, english and portuguese blocked ports, created local wars, and took territories at their will. British economic dominion and french social power dominated south america until world war II. After World War II american economic and political power began to be felt in the south american continent. <br>  As far as mexico and central america and the caribbean is concerned. The french invaded mexico and were kicked out by the freemasons, simpathetic with washington. Central america became an american banana farm shortly after their so called independence, note the masonic simbols in the central american flags. and the caribbean became the mare nostrum of the aspiring american empire, all except cuba who never achevieved independence from spain because they felt themselves 100 percent spanish and their aristocracy was never infiltrated with foreign ideas. <br>  <br>  There you go  a short explanation of the monroe doctrine. At present , the Us controls mexico, central america, and the caribbean, except cuba. <br>  In the south during 2000 ro present the people have rebelled against american dominion and have raised popular governments in Bolivia, Venezuela, Ecuador and in lesser degree brazil were the aristocracy is using Lula against further american infringement in the continent. The popular revolts against the Us in argentina were neutrilized by the propping up of yet another "soft" pro american government.<br>  <br>  That is the state of the monroe doctrine today.|`|e1c73e9278de1b39a79b8d42dcd5d11eaa	The Monroe Doctrine states three major ideas, with one more added by President Theodore Roosevelt. First, it conveys that European countries cannot colonize in any of the Americas: North, Central, or South. Second, it enforces Washington's rule of foreign policy, in which the U.S. will only be involved in European affairs if America's rights are disturbed. Third, the U.S. will consider any attempt at colonization a threat to its national security. Roosevelt added to the doctrine, and summed up his additions with the statement, "Speak softly and carry a big stick."

His job was to help the individual states work together to become one nation. While Washington was president, he visited states in New England and in the South so that many people could meet and see him. People in many different places knew he was working for them. <br>  <br>  Washington organized the government into departments so it would run smoothly. He let Congress make laws, but he made decisions about working with other countries. In his Farewell Address, George Washington warned the United States against involvement overseas. <br>  <br>  Washington helped plan a capital city for the new country. It would be named after him -- Washington, D.C. He never lived there because both the city and the President's home were still being built when he died. <br>  <br>  The next year, after a triumphal journey from Mount Vernon to New York City, Washington took the oath of office at Federal Hall. During his two precedent-setting terms, he governed with dignity as well as restraint. He also provided the stability and authority the emergent nation so sorely needed, gave substance to the Constitution, and reconciled competing factions and divergent policies within the government and his administration. Although not averse to exercising presidential power, he respected the role of Congress and did not infringe upon its prerogatives. He also tried to maintain harmony between his Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, whose differences typified evolving party divisions from which Washington kept aloof.<br>  <br>  Yet, usually leaning upon Hamilton for advice, Washington supported his plan for the assumption of state debts, concurred in the constitutionality of the bill establishing the Bank of the United States, and favored enactment of tariffs by Congress to provide federal revenue and protect domestic manufacturers.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.let.rug.nl/~usa/P/gw1/about/washingt.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.let.rug.nl/~usa/P/gw1/about/w...</a>|`|1a9e4d57320cb7594a39fb95ad34cf07aa	I would suggest you read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_washington#Presidency:_1789.E2.80.931797" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_wash...</a> to give you some of the basic information on his two terms as President.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|423eacd1f11f590e04108c26fe96fa15aa	Organized the first United States Cabinet and the Executive Branch <br>  <br>  The United States Cabinet (usually simplified as "the Cabinet") is composed of the most senior appointed officers of the executive branch of the federal government of the United States, and its existence dates back to the first American President (George Washington), who appointed a Cabinet of four people to advise and assist him in his duties.

The difference is distance -- the other stars we see are light years away, while our sun is only about 8 light minutes away (many thousands of times closer). <br>  <br>  Officially, the sun is classified as a G2 type star based on its temperature and the wavelengths or spectrum of light that it emits. The sun is an "average" star, merely one of billions of stars that orbit the center of our galaxy. <br>  <br>  The sun has "burned" for more than 4.5 billion years and will continue to do so for several billion more. It is a massive collection of gas, mostly hydrogen and helium. Because it is so massive, it has immense gravity, enough gravitational force to hold all of hydrogen and helium together (and to hold all of the planets in their orbits around the sun!). <br>  <br>  The sun does not "burn" like wood burns.

They do not want to do the day-to-day operation of the business.

If enough heat is applied, molecules will actually escape from the liquid in the form of gas or steam.  The principle is the same for liquid and gas.--For example,  when air in a hot air balloon is heated, the molecules become agitated and move faster and faster.  They move further and further apart.  Less air molecules, less weight.  So the balloon rises.|`|Fu58n9V6aa	Warm fluids rise because the molcules are less densely packed (farther apart).  The exception is water as it approaches freezing.  The hydrogen bonding betwen water molecules is strongest at about 39F.  As water further cools towards 32F, the bonding weakens and the molecules align to crystallize (freeze).   The water in a frozen pond is warmest at the bottom.|`|L0puAscraa	Warm fluids rise because the molecules are further apart.  This is because heat causes things to expand, and when things expand they're less dense.  Things that are less dense rise more than things that are more dense.

Bandwagon ? this technique attempts to sell something based   upon the notion that everyone is buying or believing it (e.g., everyone who is anyone is buying a Polo shirt).  The message is that you should not be left out.<br>  <br>      2.     Good Ole Days ? this technique attempts to sell a product or idea on the basis that the product or idea will help the buyer return to a simpler lifestyle characteristic of the good ole days (e.g., a return to the days when the family sat around the table and talked while sharing Country Time Lemonade).<br>  <br>      3.    Plain Folks ? this technique attempts to sell a product by indicating that the product is good because it was designed to meet the needs of everyday people (e.g., a family picture buying a four?door sedan that is solidly built and apparently designed just for such a typical, practical family).<br>  <br>      4.    Testimonials ? this technique shows a well?known person endorsing a product with the implication that this person knows best in this instance (e.g., Michael Jordan telling everyone that Nike products are good).<br>  <br>      5.    Heartstrings ? this technique uses human emotions to sell a product.  Examples include a candidate depicted as being soft on crime which causes people to fear his election and an undertaker explaining to the family that the type of casket they buy depends upon how much they loved the departed one.<br>  <br>      6.    Transfer ? this technique attempts to increase the lure of something by associating it with something else that is well accepted (e.g., a candidate seated at a desk with the flag prominently displayed).<br>  <br>      7.    New and Improved ? this technique implies that a product is best because being new and being improved are desirable attributes to be seriously considered when making choices (e.g., Apple computer is state of the art).<br>  <br>      8.    Labeling ? this technique attempts to influence peoples' thinking about people, places, and things through carefully chosen terms that carry strong connotations of a pejorative or praiseworthy nature (e.g., a strong family man).<br>  <br>      9.    Card Stacking ? this technique attempts to mislead people by providing only untrue or half?true facts or by not providing pertinent information (e.g., a candidate reporting only his or her voting record on those areas that will be readily accepted by his constituency).<br>  <br>      10. That's Incredible ? this technique attempts to sell a product by using catchy phrases and powerful modifiers (e.g., the ultimate driving machine).

For example:<br>  <br>  1)  Placement advertising in movies.  Remember the Coca-Cola the star always drank?  <br>  2)  The usual advertising on billboards, in magazines, on the net.<br>  3)  "Buying" a stadium:  "The Jets are playing at the Cingular Stadium".  This hooks the consumers' minds into a very popular sport.<br>  4)  Store placement (how and where the Pepsi is displayed).  If you'll notice, most restaurants only have one cola.  They are not allowed to have the other.  Cola people are very aggressive and are not above using polite threats.  "We'll raise the price."<br>  5)  Posters on buses, bus benches, inside bus stop cubicles.<br>  <br>  All these and more are designed to get their advertising in our faces - continually.  It is methods like these that have made Coca-Cola the largest drink company In The World.
8d81887010c36a29e8015aaac033c713aa	LSDAS bases its overall score on your cumulative GPA.  This GPA is also increased or decreased based on the academic quality of your school (e.g. Yale scores better than some state college that anyone can get into because the competition for grades is higher at Yale).  This GPA score is about one third of your total score.  The remainder (about two thirds) of your total score is determined by your LSAT score.  Thus, although your cumulative GPA is important, the main factor determining whether a student is accepted to law school is the student's LSAT score.|`|9e159ba052de639e2a18897391ffabf5aa	it's cumulative, meaning one GPA. you need to be in the high 3's to even think about attending law school (even then they'll be a lot of competition).<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|TaeoYysjaa	It's one cumulative GPA but in truth, while GPA is important, your LSAT score will make or break what school you get into.

Therein they will teach you how to do not only CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but also the Heimlich maneuver. <br>  <br>  You can probably find some explanations online, just in case you happen to run into trouble.   Best way to avoid choking is to be very careful feeding the baby, if it's old enough to be on solid foods.   Generally fluids can be easily coughed out, at least small amounts, so if it's still on the bottle, you're both relatively safe.   But look into CPR, it will make you more valueable as a babysitter.|`|ufznH6Ejaa	I agree look online and tomorrow see if your mom can help. When is your first job? good luck. :-)

My son was acting out when he was in kindergarten and I learned that he indeed hyperactive.  I was very reluctant to give him meds at first, but when all the alternatives were give and failed, I did the meds.  After taking the meds, he paid more attention, grades came up and his behavior went from frowns everyday to smiles.  Maybe you should have him tested to make sure that he is doing well intellectually and then play it by ear.  I also think for my son that watching too much television played and plays a big part in his ability to focus and become more involved in his education.  I also work a lot with him at home on his reading and mathematical skills.

ccad1af60fac9baa5be1c4b6e35f105baa	If we all stopped getting our drivers licenses renewed, it'd be a whole lot easier to steal someones identity.  What would you use as a photo id?  The same drivers license you had when you were 17.. but at 75 years old??  Insanity.  If anything, we need mandatory retesting every 25 years so people don't forget how to drive.  Were the roads in your area the same in 1982?  Will they be the same in 2032?  Of course not.  So why do we allow people who are 80 years old, who got their license in 1944, to drive cars today without a retest at some point?  Were the roads and cars and rules the same in 1944 as now?  <br>  <br>  As far as renewing the registration and plates on your vehicle, without them you wouldn't have the inspection system in your state.  Which means you'd often drive behind cars without doors, cars with sharp edges everywhere, cars with bald tires in the snow, etc.  That $4 a year sounds a little better now, doesn't it?  :-)|`|AA11387869	Come to Arizona--our licenses don't expire until we're 65.<br>  <br>  However, that thing with tags, and emissions is a hassle, and runs into some money.|`|b29569bed17f720c4c4c164ca1648f9faa	The drivers license renewal helps protect the safe drivers from Granny Dee who is just A LITTLE TOO OLD to be on the street. You know the kind--they'd hit a curb trying to turn to the right. You may not see it now because you're only 17--the more you drive, the more you'll see the importance of drivers license renewal. The things the DMV need, including your SS card, are a matter of protocol. These people are part of law enforcement. Not all people are "straight and honest" but, most know if they get caught doing anything unlawful with your SS card it's a felony. No law enforcement job and time in the penitentiary for the felony.|`|AA10678518	I think you are right, it is certainly a waste of our time, and it is an exercise in dealing with often rude and frequently inept public servants.

By the way if you want to do an internet search try ESRD (End Stage Renal Disease) Program which is how the government refers to the dialysis program.<br>  <br>  One thing to consider is dialysis is like a switch: with it I live, without it I die. The provision of dialysis has more in common with emergency room care then with other types of medical service. I think the Federal government would save money (and untold grief) if they would involve themselves before people need dialysis or a transplant. There is much that can be done to slow the progression of kidney disease once the dimminished function is identified.

00b81256797cd6e35923cf05852306a5aa	When I was studying in university, I was always amazed by the fact that some students could score better than those who worked really hard. <br>  <br>  It took me a while to find out their strategies to study smart in school. There are many ways where you can improve in regards to study smart. <br>  <br>  First, let's talk about memory. Most students waste alot of time memorizing, especially when they only start to memorize when exams are nearer. Smart students consistently revise what they have learned such that they would not need to memorize so much when exams are around the corner. <br>  <br>  Secondly, to study smart, you need to focus on one subject one at a time. Many students often tend to multi task by trying to study many things at a go. Before they would even finish revising one subject, they would jump to the other. This way they are learning very ineffectively. <br>  <br>  There are many ways you could study smarter. Below is the website you may want to subscribe to because they taught me many valuable skills in regards to learning and studying.|`|5127233021af0e5eac50a4889eeb79cbaa	concentration.<br>  listening power<br>  interest<br>  spend more time on studies.|`|7183ce60bceec0fc84eca26c5a31f5a7aa	Find what works for you and go with it.  Some study better by writing things down, others by reading, and rereading.  I like to listen to music when I study and make flash cards.  But, find what works for you.|`|akRHra97aa	Take ginko biloba and jen shen. Multivitamins are also recomendable.<br>  Good luck on exams!|`|QUvtXRHGaa	It sounds like the biggest problem you are having is that you are finding it difficult to concentrate. I would say that there are a number of things that you can try. For starters, try finding some place that you can go to study that is quiet and away from distractions like people talking, television set being on, radio playing or windows with open views. Close the curtains, close the door to your room, turn off the t.v. and the radio and politely ask family members not to bother you during that time. <br>  <br>  Do not overwhelm yourself with the information that you are trying to learn. Start off small. Allow yourself time to take breaks as well. Let's say you start off with researching one aspect of a country per night. Allow yourself time to study and take a 5-10 minute break once every hour or so to use the bathroom/get a drink/grab a healthy snack and stretch your body so you wont get fatigued as easily.<br>  <br>  Try not to study too late at night so that you will be relaxed, but not so relaxed that you want to go to sleep.<br>  <br>  Do not procrastinate. If you need to research something and be able to share your research by the end of the week... do not wait until the last minute to begin... you will only set yourself up for failure that way. Best bet, start as soon as you obtain the assignment! <br>  <br>  If you are serious about making this your career choice in life, then you need to make sure that you remind yourself daily of how much you want this for your future and how important it is to study and obtain as many facts as you possibly can. Perhaps this little bit of motivation from your own perspective will be enough to help keep you on track a bit better in your study habits as well!!<br>  <br>  If you would like, you can also do some online research to assist you in study habits. Try searching for "study tips" and see if that brings up any other useful tips for you. <br>  <br>  I hope that I have at least helped you a tiny bit! Good luck in the future and in all that you do. I wish you the best|`|AA12371905	anything you do must be liked by you .Then you can be smater in anything you want.

Yo toda mi educación hasta la preparatoria habia sido en escuela privada y te puedo decir que las ventajas que vi en comparación con amigos que estaban en escuelas públicas es que yo si sé inglés y mis amigos no saben ni decir hello, ademas llevé religión durante todos los a?os y de cierta forma tratan de inculcarte valores que en las escuelas públicas no;  otro punto a favor es que te relacionas con gente de un cierto nivel mas o menos bueno, sin tratar de hacer menos a nadie, pero si se nota la diferencia y te lo digo porque actualmente estudio en una universidad pública y en estas escuelas ves y tratas todo tipo de gente, desde ricos hasta gente muy humilde. Ya depende de ti la elección, ninguna te hará mejor persona ni mejor estudiante eso ya depende de cada quien.

Yo sólo puedo apuntar un dato objetivo como docente: los mejores profesionales de la educación están en la educación pública. Esta consideración no es un demérito de los profesores de la privada, es simplemente que las condiciones laborales en la educación pública son mejores que en la privada. Todos los profesores que conozco quieren aprobar unas oposiciones.<br>  Por otra parte, la educación privada normalmente cuenta con mejores instalaciones y actividades extraescolares.<br>  Por último, se?alar que la educación pública está haciendo un tremendo esfuerzo para equipararse a la privada en los aspectos en los que la privada siempre ha destacado (instalaciones, servicios, bilingüismo y calidad)<br>  Todo esto desde un punto de vista andaluz, supongo que la realidad puede ser distinta en otros lugares.<br>  Saludos
AA12005019	you sound almost incoherent. <br>  <br>  there are no specific branches of engineering that will set you for life; if there were one, everyone would be doing that.<br>   <br>  my advice is to read up about each engineering branch and try to decide for yourself which interests you the most. there is no point studying electrical engineering if it was the most profitable one if you hate it and drop out of the course within two years.

Maybe, if you can go to summer school, you can choose a course which you can do well in and boost your GPA.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, my advice to you is to make an appointment with your counselor to discuss this and what you can do within that school's system.

Any class that starts with a "zero" is a non-credit class.  For example, the number your  class may be 098.  If so, then these types of non-credit classes do not count at all toward your degree or GPA, they only prepare you for your credit classes.  By the way, what was the class and number?  Let me take a wild guess.  Judging by your grammar in your question, it was probably a remedial course in English.
RO7c0pyEaa	The tangent ratio is basically a way to find a the measure of a leg of a right triangle, when one measurement and an angle are already given to you. The tangent ratio is very simple, tan(angle)=opposite side/adjacent side. Plug in all the values that you know, for example, the measure of the angle, and the measure of one of the sides.  For the side that you don't know, put and X. The value for the tangent can be easily found using a scientific calculator. Just punch the "tan" button and the measure of the angle, and the calculator will give you the value. All you have left to do is solve for X. Hope this helps!

sc4BtGxGaa	I have taught 8th grade since 1971, in New York State.  Each district has policies about advancement of their students.  No one "skips a grade" anymore - but they have the opportunity to take advanced classes from the next grade, or at various HS levels, so that they can actually graduate early - or stay in their home HS and take the remaining HS courses they need to graduate, PLUS courses that are transferable to the college of their eventual choice.  As an individual student, YOU cannot take it upon yourself to just decide to "skip a grade", but your counselors can assist you in pursuing the plan I have outlined above.|`|06da16d0f4e9e35477036b469e4b42c6aa	At my school, a handfull of people end up skipping grades, mostly due to social issues.

4Nd1Unliaa	If you want to go to medical school, don't go to the community college. You won't even be considered.|`|GPBJOH2Vaa	If you are thinking of med school, you're looking at student loans out the wazzoo, so money should definitely be a consideration (as if it wasn't already).  All things being equal, the community college will be cheaper (unless you get a nice scholarship package from the other program), and you'll still be getting your degree from the university after your transfer, so in terms of $ and in terms of clinical experience, you're coming out ahead.  That sounds pretty good to me.<br>  <br>  Also, think about what it is you'll need more as a nurse.  Is it clinical experience or nursing theory?  I really don't know the answer -- maybe you could ask some local nurses their opinions?  <br>  <br>  As for med school, I know the conventional wisdom is not to even look at a community college if you're going to go to med school, law school or grad school.  But I'm living proof that this is a load of hogwash.  I went for 2 years to a community college, transferred, and then went on to a VERY prestigious law school -- who didn't even blink at my community college transcripts because they saw I could cut the mustard at the college I transferred to and graduated from (the degree and my GPA were enough proof for them).  So don't worry about that end of things -- just concentrate on getting the most suitable education you can get.  And good luck!|`|FHDbuXnEaa	Congratulations to you on your choice to enter the medical field!  I felt obligated to answer your question, since I am pretty much in the exact same boat as you.  I applied to my local community college's nursing program that begins this Fall 07 and was accepted.  However, our program relies on test scores and completed prereqs for entrance, not lottery.  After I complete my Associate's Degree at the community college, I plan to transfer to the local university to complete the RN-BSN degree program.<br>  <br>  After that, I am also thinking of possibly applying to med school.  I have asked several people their opinions on students with a nursing background entering medical school, and they have all told me the same thing - the undergraduate degree you obtain before entering medical school doesn't matter - your grades do.  They all have advised me to choose something I enjoy and would do well at, and go from there.  I advise you to do the same thing.<br>  <br>  As far as which school you should choose, I think if I were you I would accept the entrance into the community college if you get it.  Entrance into nursing programs around the country is very competitive, and you wouldn't want to reject that one and then not get accepted at the university program.  Besides, you can always transfer to the university later for a Bachelor's or Master's degree in Nursing!  Hope this helps, and good luck to you no matter what you choose!

DGO5vL37aa	Wow, 3 or 4 book reports and a 65 page math book.  That's a lot of work for the summer.  Most of my college professors don't even assign that much work in a 16 week semester.  We always had summer reading requirements in our high school but they were really more like suggestions because nobody ever read them anyway. However, on the first week of class some teachers would make us read one of the books and have us write a paper on it.  It was never so much a forced assignment.  I've never heard of a school actually assigning coursework to be turned in at the end of the summer.  I'm curious to know how this work is graded and who it is turned in to.  It seems that if the school has the authority and determination to force homework upon students in that school they are not going to change their minds about it.  I would suggest getting the work done as early as possible so that you have the rest of the summer to yourself.  Either that or change schools like the previous poster said.|`|b29569bed17f720c4c4c164ca1648f9faa	If it's in the curriculum, no one, unless they POSSIBLY go before the school board, via a meeting, can change it.

They started looking for ways to overload the mail servers, and chain e-mails were born.

klp1ydfXaa	Not all science is about collecting numbers to put on a grid.<br>  <br>  In my opinion you can make a presentable science project on spidrons by producing some two dimensional examples and constructing some 3-D spidron-related sculptures. These should arouse curiosity. Such graphics alone can be impressive.<br>  <br>  To really inspire admiration you'll want to show how spidrons can be applied to something else, if they can be.
B5YsTF4iaa	Pretty much everything. In HIgh School, you are pushed in the right direction, given second chances (many many second chances). It is free and you do not lose money if you fail a class. You can always start over next year. High School, as far as your future goes, is meaningless, to a certain point. <br>  In college, none of the above is true. I'm adding this in here because I forgot to mention it: college is REALLY expensive and if you fail your class or even get a D, which does not count in college, you just lost all your money. No refunds nothing. So if you go to a universtiy or state school, you might be out 600-1000 dollars. Your professors honestly could care less if you do well. There are a few professors who will give you ONE second chance, depending on the circumstances. But if you fail a test, miss homework, dont come to class, they dont care. You will not get a call home, you will not be able to get the assignment unless they have a website or you know someone in that class. Also, and this is the most important aspect of college to be successful, you CAN NOT fall behind. In college, if you fall behind in reading or whatever, it almost always will affect your grade because of the amount of studying and homework. In high school, I remember, I wouldnt touch a single page of a textbook for a month or two and barely do the homework and be just fine. I would sometimes miss three or four classes and still pass. High school DOES NOT prepare you for college. At all. In college, you're on your own. You have to be completly organized and stay on track with homework and especially with studying. They say that for every unit you should set aside 2 hours a day for studying and homework. This is if you want an A+. I can tell you that, give or take a half an hour or so, this is true. You can definitiely get by in college by studying once in a while and only getting behind a day or so. But do not expect anything above a B-. Maybe C depending on the course. The few good things about college: You get to choose your class schedule, to a point. If you are totally not a morning person and typically do not even get up until 10am, you can take afternoon or evening class. If you absolutely hate going to class or live far away, you can take classes two days a week. However, if you choose to do that, you will be in class each day for longer. You have a lot of freedom in college, which is good and bad,. If you are a good student, it is perfect. But if you are like how I was when I entered college, it is awfull. I used to ditch class all the time, or leave early. I did not pass 75 percent of my classes at that time, sometimes 100 percent. Another good thing about college is the comradarie. Students are the only ones who will help you. Professors have too little time to be of great service to you and when you do get them, it is quick. Some take a week or two to answer e-mails. You are treated like a functional adult, whether you are or not. 10 POINTS?|`|GNeLxx6Caa	1) high school is mandatory. College is not<br>  2) in college you are mostly there to learn a skill for a specific field. In High you are learning general education.<br>  3) High school = free unless you go to a private school.

The professors will not ask you how your research paper is coming along- they will expect you to come to them if you are experiencing difficulty. Whether or not maturity exists within a student is beside the point the fact is that in college instructors expect you to be responsible. Most will gladly work with you if you are experiencing problems as long as you keep an open line of communication. However, if the reason you are having some much difficulty is due to your constant partying (which is apparent to the instructor) they may not be so willing. Just remember- get all of your school work done, don't wait until the last minute, and then go party and hae fun. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|pqpIDG9gaa	1.

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Make a graph, and label the x-axis with the amount of years that go by - so, numbers 1 through maybe 25? You'll have to see how high you need to go after you do the math. The number 1 will represent the first year - January 1998. The second number will be January 1999, and so on. <br>  <br>  Label the y-axis with numbers starting at 300 ($300) to 700 ($700). Make them in increments of, say, 50? I think that aughta do it.<br>  <br>  Divide 300 / 0.75 (that's $300 increasing by 75% - dividing is counterintuitive, but trust me, it's how you do it). Do this as many times as you need to, until you get to 700 (that's the $700 you're looking for). Keep track of how many times you need to multiply it, as that's how many "years" have gone by to get to that number. <br>  <br>  For the first year, put a point at 300, since in January 1998, her stock was $300. For the second year, put a point at how much it was worth, and so on. Then connect the dots. Voila, you're done. :)|`|DujVr1MMaa	use each year as a point on the x axis, and use the value on the y axis. the value for year one (year 0 is the year in which she has 300 dollars) will be 300 * (1.075^1) in year 2 it would be 300 * (1.075^2). to determine the year in which the value is equal to 700 set the value equal to 700. so you'd have 700=300*(1.075^x) solve for x and thats the year in which her portfolio equals 700. i hope this helps|`|ohqZXfYJaa	you divid 300 by 7.5, this will give you the amount gained per year, then make a graph that marks each step, maybe by the 25's? anyway, you add that total to the 300, and mark that point on the graph, continue this untill you reach 700. Make sure you connect the points!

RO7c0pyEaa	This is actually a very easy proof: the hard part is coming up with a picture.<br>  Drawing the picture:<br>  1. You know that B is the midpoint of AS, so you can draw a straight line AS with midpoint B. <br>  <br>  2. You know you have a triangle ABC. Draw a point C above line segment AB, and connect the dots to form triangle ABC.<br>  <br>  3. You also know you have a triangle BST. Draw a point T above line segment BS, and connect the points to form triangle BST.<br>  <br>  At this point, you should have 2 triangles that are connected at 1 point. Now we can proceed with the proof.<br>  <br>  1. Because B is the midpoint of AS, segment AB is congruent to segment BS<br>  <br>  2. When parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are congruent. Because segments AC and BT are parallel, angles CAB and TBS are congruent.<br>  <br>  3. Similarly, segments CB and TS are parallel, so angles CBA and TSB are congruent.<br>  <br>  4. The triangles are congruent by the angle-side-angle postulate.<br>  
eHDDZekKaa	This really happened to me when I was teaching:  a student who had WALKED PAST the bathroom on the way to class asked for permission to go use the restroom only 5 minutes after class time had started.  I pointed out that he had time between classes and please, use that time for the bathroom NEXT time.<br>  <br>  He returned after a few minutes, which I thought was a bit long for him because the bathroom was about 10 steps away.  However, I let it go until he again asked to use the bathroom about 20 minutes into class.  I asked if he was ill, or had some special reason and he honestly said no.  Then, I asked what he had done the first time I had let him go?  He actually said, "Oh, I was messing around throwing wet paper towels at another kid and a teacher kicked me out."<br>  <br>  Hmmmmmm, I wonder if that would work on your teacher?  <br>  <br>  (Hint:  it didn't work with me.  He followed me around the room on his knees with hands clasped, begging.  I said, "I just thought you would like to know that begging doesn't work on me."  He snapped his fingers and said: "DARN!!  It always works on my mother!"  He then went off and worked for the rest of class.  Please know that had he asked me again or had I seen any hint that he might have desperately needed to use the bathroom, I would have approached him and given him permission.  I also had a standing policy with any class that if one had to vomit, or wet pants, or have diarrhea, that they should leave first and ask permission later.

1myyubNeaa	French, after étienne de Silhouette (1709–1767), French finance minister.|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	From the Online Etymology ("study of the history of words") Dictionary, and edited to make it a bit more understandable:<br>  <br>  1798, from the French word "silhouette," in allusion to étienne de Silhouette (1709-67), French minister of finance in 1759. Usually said to be so called because it was an inexpensive way of making a likeness of someone, a derisive reference to Silhouette's petty economies to finance the Seven Years' War, which were unpopular among the nobility. But other theories are that it refers to his brief tenure in office, or the story that he decorated his chateau with such portraits. The verb is recorded from 1876. The family name is a Frenchified form of a Basque surname; Arnaud de Silhouette, the finance minister's father, was from Biarritz in the French Basque country; the southern Basque form of the name would be Zuloeta or Zulueta, which contains the suffix -eta "abundance of" and zulo "hole" (possibly here meaning "cave").|`|6DFhlt4daa	Etymology:<br>      French, from étienne de Silhouette ?1767 French controller general of finances; perhaps from his ephemeral tenure<br>  Date:     1783<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/silhouette" rel="nofollow">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionar...</a><br>  <br>  Late 18th century. < French, after étienne de Silhouette (1709-1767), French finance minister<br>  <br>  Word History<br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  As French finance minister in the late 1750s, étienne de Silhouette gained a reputation for stinginess, and silhouette came to be used for anything skimped. One account of the application of the word to a simple picture showing a dark shape against a light background is that it carries on this notion of "simplicity" or "lack of finish," but an alternative theory is that Silhouette himself was in the habit of making such pictures.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861732805" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/d...</a><br>  <br>  As defined by the Oxford English Dictionary, a "silhouette" is "a portrait obtained by tracing the outline of a profile, head, or figure by means of its shadow or in some other way, and filling in the whole with black." No one knows who invented the basic technique of such shadow painting, but that's not surprising, considering that shadow paintings have been found on the walls of prehistoric caves. But we do know the story of how such paintings came to be known as "silhouettes."<br>  <br>  Shortly after Etienne de Silhouette was appointed to the office of Controller General of France in 1759, he had what he thought was a bright idea. With a little fiddling and a slew of new taxes, Etienne thought, he'd be able to rationalize France's national budget and drag the country out of the bankruptcy it had sunk into after the Seven Years' War. Unfortunately, Silhouette made the mistake of slapping some of his heaviest taxes on the nobility, and a scant nine months later he found himself, not surprisingly, unemployed.<br>  <br>  During his brief tenure, however, the public perception of Silhouette as a no-fun pennypincher had made his name a household word, and not a nice one, either. Anything made at low cost by cutting corners was known as "a la Silhouette" (in the manner of Silhouette), which quickly became a popular synonym for "on the cheap." So it wasn't long before simple shadow portraits, which could be had for a fraction of the cost of having a real portrait painted, came to be known as portraits "a la silhouette," and eventually simply as "silhouettes." <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.word-detective.com/072999.html#silhouette" rel="nofollow">http://www.word-detective.com/072999.htm...</a>
4KtPFzz5aa	In a secluded monastery in what is now the Czech Republic, a monk named Gregor Mendel was studying heredity in a garden of peas. Mendel, the son of a farmer, had always been interested in plants, and while at the University of Vienna he had been trained in mathematics and learned how to design experiments and analyze data. In the 1850s, he decided to run an experiment to better understand what kept species distinct and what made it possible for hybrids to form. He bred thousands of pea plants and recorded how traits were passed on from one generation to the next.<br>  <a href="http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/_0_0/history_13" rel="nofollow">http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary...</a><br>  <br>  The Father of Genetics<br>  <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/19037/idfog.html" rel="nofollow">http://library.thinkquest.org/19037/idfo...</a><br>  <br>  |`|81ldun0baa	He used pea plants because they are fast to grow and have the potential for multiple mutations to manipulate.<br>  <br>  he is the father of genetics|`|ISLGfW6uaa	Mendel used pea plants for his experiment to prove that gender during reproduction was random.

When I first started looking, I found a bunch of schools online that were private and required a tuition, but many states (I think, at least PA does) have public cyber schools that wont cost you a dime (mine even pays for my internet while I'm in school and provided a computer). <br>  Also, you have to talk to your school's guidance counselor. At first, they'll probably be against it and try to convince you to stay. They may even tell you that colleges frown upon cyber schools, but I've already been accepted into two colleges, so that's obviously a lie. If you put your foot down and your parents support you maybe you can get some suggestions from him/her. Once you decide which school, contact them and talk to your current school about switching. I switched from brick and mortar schooling last year to cyber and I love it. To my knowledge, most cyber schools offer a real high school diploma. <br>  <br>  This should really be helpful, too:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_virtual_schools" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vir...</a><br>  .

FZKFLTyLaa	It means your computer isn't finishing it so it should be abandoned for a more worthwhile pursuit.
TNTFomKeaa	You have to ask yourself, who benefits from you going to university? You do, and indirectly, the economy may as well, depending on what you choose to use your degree for. I think the government has struck a reasonable balance in expecting students to contribute to the costs of their education without having to pay for the whole thing. Also, with the system of student loans, you don't have to pay it back until you are earning and can afford it. Education becomes accessible to every citizen because you don't have to pay upfront for your education, as you do in many other countries.<br>  I have studied abroad in France and the US. In France, higher education is completely free. The result is huge class sizes (perhaps people studying who might not be committed enough to do it if they themselves had to pay) and students who take their education for granted. Universities are underfunded - teachers have to share offices, taking shifts, and don't have time to help students individually. Students don't see much difference between university and high school. I think in general UK students are harder working and more motivated, probably because they have to pay and this gives their education more value.<br>  On the other end of the scale, tuition fees in the US are astronomical. The government does sponsor poorer students, but in general your parents pay your tuition upfront. Students there know how much their education costs and put the work in so that they are sure to get their money's worth. They also benefit from excellent libraries, well paid and motivated teachers, and well equipped campuses. <br>  With all this considered, do you not consider that the UK government is striking a reasonably fair balance? Universities have to be paid for. University education, unlike secondary school, is not compulsory so if you really don't want to pay you have the option of not going. But at the end of the day, you, as the beneficiary of your degree, will benefit from higher earnings for the rest of your life. Surely you are willing to pay back something for that?<br>  Incidentally, as far as PhDs go, students benefit from funding and are offered posts as teaching assistants at universities. This offsets the cost of their degree and provides them with a generous living allowance.|`|9faf164b8bfd02a8adbd83229d74816baa	Even if schools are a public service for education, they still need to make money and the tuition fee is where most of it comes from. If you take that away, they can't pay your teachers salary and  you wont be able to learn anything because the school will have no teachers.

Use a search engine to look-up  past interviews of the celebrity in question and see if he/she has any personal interests, which relates to the cause. 2)  Popularity and Public Image- Will this celebrity generate more press for this cause? Is the celebrity respectable? 3) History - Does the celebrity have a history  of working for similar charitable causes?  4) Availability?  Is the celebrity available to make an appearance at the event or to help out with an ad campaign?  Have a couple back-up celebs in mind.

8RrNrjFPaa	University of South Carolina has a great law and history department|`|AA10023710	Who hooked you up with Devry? Did you pick them, or did your guidance counsellor? Did your counsellor know you wanted to go on for a history degree, with law school as a possibility for your future? If so, then I am not pleased with that person, Oleg.     Devry University is not regionally accredited, which means that it's possible that the classes you're doing there - your entire associates degree - may not transfer to a standard university. In addition, Devry is not well respected in the academic world, so if law school might be in your future, Devry would be an extremely poor choice.     If you want to get an associates degree while in high school, you can look at your local community colleges. They are far cheaper than Devry, and because they are respectable and regionally accredited, your credits/degree will transfer to a decent university when it comes time for you to leave high school.     In order to become a lawyer, you must first get your bachelors degree from a regionally accredited, respectable university (not Devry). Then you can go to law school, and get your JD. You can not study law - to be a lawyer - for your bachelors degree. You can study history, and that would actually be a good choice of major if you think you want to go to law school afterwards. In fact, you could study history with the idea that you might either become a history teacher or a lawyer. You could go on to law school after you graduate, or else become a history teacher for a while, see how you like it, and go to law school, if you want to, later.     There are some great schools in your region, with great reputations both as general universities and in terms of their history programs. I'd suggest you look at U Illinois Urbana Champaign, University of Chicago, U Michigan Ann Arbor, U Wisconsin Madison, Northwestern University, Indiana University Bloomington, Grinnell College, Oberlin College, Macalester College, Kenyon College, DePauw University, Denison University, Wabash College, St. Olaf College, Illinois Wesleyan University, Wheaton College (IL), Beloit College, Kalamazoo College, Earlham College, College of Wooster, Creighton U, Valparaiso U, Butler U, Xavier U, Bradley U. Any of those would be good choices, if law school is where you want to go afterwards.

Mzho0lsnaa	Hi. I also want to become a teacher, in Primary education. The question is, what sort of teaching do you want to go into, Primary or Secondary? Either way, you usually require results from A level exams or college courses. This kind of profession also requires you do some work experience (always looks good on a CV or application). U could go to university and study a course (depending on what teaching u prefer) or you could try different routes like going to be a teaching assisstant and gaining experience through that way. Also, when u go into teaching, the employers (as well as university administration ppl) like to see that you're a well rounded person and you have to be comitted to want to teach, its not easy lol. <br>  If you want some more advise don't be afraid to add me or email me. I think teaching is a noble profession, im willing to help if needed :)|`|X6BrtJ9eaa	I'm surprised you didn't receive career advice in year 10 and 11, unless you left school a while ago and have just decided to go into teaching. You will need at least 3 A levels. Subjects depend on whether you want to teach at Primary or Secondary level. You can do these at college or sixth form. <br>  Then you will need to go to university for a degree. If you want to teach at Primary level you could do a Bachelor of Education with Qualified Teacher status, which covers all the subjects you will need to teach and includes periods of teaching practice in schools.<br>  For Secondary level you need a degree, preferably in the subject you wish to teach, and then a Post Graduate Certificate of Education (PGCE)|`|56aae78e821fccc8bfcd71a99569cf29aa	all the official information is at <br>  www.tda.gov.uk/Recruit.aspx|`|100b7048a63bacdbd18d8ea89e6894a2aa	You need A levels and then a degree, then a PGCE(postgraduate cert in Education) or you can do a BEd degree.|`|OaDXVJU1aa	Are you lazy? Do you want 90 days (3 months) holiday each year? <br>  <br>  The best advice I can give you, is get a real job first, then you will realise how easy you've got it, once you are a teacher.
iGrj5lS5aa	this quotes is from books as well as from movie<br>  <br>  <br>  The Chocolate War<- book<br>  by Robert Cormier <br>  <br>  The Chocolate Wa  <- movie<br>      * Director: Keith Gordon<br>      * AMG Rating: starstarstar<br>      * Genre: Drama<br>      * Movie Type: Teen Movie, Psychological Drama<br>      * Themes: Fighting the System, Teachers and Students, High School Life<br>      * Main Cast: John Glover, Ilan Mitchell-Smith, Wally Ward, Doug Hutchison, Adam Baldwin<br>      * Release Year: 1988<br>      * Country: US<br>      * Run Time: 95 minutes<br>      * MPAA Rating: R<br>  <br>  <br>  The independently produced Chocolate War marked actor Keith Gordon's directorial debut. Adapted from the popular novel by Robert Cormier (I Am the Cheese), it functions as a political allegory set in a curricular context, in the same vein as Rene Daalder's Massacre at Central High (1976). In War, Ilan Mitchell-Smith plays Jerry, a new enrollee at the exclusive Catholic prep school St. Trinity. He attempts to fit in by joining the football team, but immediately runs head-first into Brother Leon (John Glover), a ruthless academician striving for a promotion to headmaster, and The Vigils, a underground student gang that wields a massive amount of power within the school. The abusive Leon attempts to goad as many students as possible into selling chocolates for the school fundraiser, but Vigil leader Archie (Wally Ward) has Jerry publicly refuse to sell any for ten days, as one of the annual 'hazing' rituals that the Vigils dole out to freshman enrollees. Jerry agrees, which turns him into a rebel hero among his fellow students, but he then extends his refusal beyond the week-and-a-half limit imposed by Archie, which puts him head-to-head with both Leon and the Vigils. However, instead of turning into an underdog story at that point, The Chocolate War remains realistic and cynical.

a01a4c7fa42d359ddf53eaa686c7f84faa	Since the triangles are congruent, then the measure of angle A = 2x + 5 = measure of angle R = 55.  Since R corresponds to A, we can solve for x:    A = R  2x + 5 = 55  2x = 55 - 5  2x = 50  x = 25    Now we can solve for S:    S = x - 15  S = 25 - 15   S = 10    Since the sum of all the measures of the angles is 180, then the measure of angle T is this:    T = 180 - (R + S)  T = 180 - (55 + 10)  T = 180 - 65  T = 115.    So the measures of all the angles are R = 55, S = 10, and T = 115.  Note that R + S + T = 55 + 10 + 115 = 180, so our answers seem to work.    You're welcome!  I'm just sorry I forgot to include the measures of the other angles.  But, considering B is congruent to S and C is congruent to T, you figured those out quite correctly.

LwywrSRkaa	All teachers said to me that A-levels are gonna be hard. Don't listen to them, I personally am choosing to do biology, chemistry, physics and maths. They're all traditional and people are saying it's gonna be hard for me to cope and that's saying it to a hard working and committed student lol. But do remember you can drop a subject in the second year. <br>  <br>  Universities prefer traditional subjects so things like maths, English and science. Art and design is I'm afraid a 'soft' A-level. =( Here are a list of 'soft' A-levels <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7174848.stm." rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/717...</a> But don't let that put you off because it depends what career you want of course! =)|`|vmVF3S8Zaa	maths is good :)
f0WNLxrqaa	I find that it makes sense to do the multiple choice first and then end with the essay.<br>  <br>  First off, multiple choice is usually a good way to just get the mind going again, so that by the time you get to the essays, your brain is already in "test mode", and you don't just stare at the prompt blankly.<br>  <br>  Secondly, essays tend to have a life of their own, and you never know when you'll have a bunch of great ideas and end up writing a lot.  Because of this, you don't want to use up too much time and not have time for the multiple choice.  After all, you can get partial credit for having some good ideas on the essay, but if you don't finish all the multiple choice, you'll lose all the points for the blank ones.|`|Dh0JX2Onaa	It is a matter of personal preference. You should time the test properly based on the value of each question. Generally speaking you will need more time for an essay with the same point point value as some short answer questions./|`|EQAwlKZ5aa	It depends. Do the questions that you are sure of first. If you get stuck and feel like there is a question that you are not sure of leave it and do it at the end. So if you find the multiple choices easier, do them first. But if you read the topic of the essay and you get a lot of ideas, then do the essay first.

Portraits or landscapes would be good, but as colour is the key, then you can pretty much do anything.  Best of Luck.
cL0aHkYEaa	What I think...  Well, this piece reveals how you are feeling now that you and the other person are apart.      It reveals that the relationship you had was not equal in terms of feeling--you loved him more than he loved you.    It reveals that you are having a hard time letting go--you are still in the "give me one more chance" phase.    It reveals that to a very large degree, your world revolved around this person, rather than incorporating the other person into a world of your own that already had a good solid footing in terms of self-confidence and self-esteem.     It reveals that,most likely, your first thought upon rising is this other person, and he is your last thought as you tuck in for the night.    It reveals that you are young, and haven't yet learned that when you let another person represent "everything" to you, that that is very, very suffocating to the other person--eventually he will have no choice but to leave, because he feels himself being consumed.    These are all normal things that happen in young love.  The important thing is to leave with your Self intact, and not just intact, but aware of how important your own self-image is, how crucial your own groundedness is.  The more interesting you are in terms of how fully you live life, the more others are attracted to you.     Since you ask what we readers think, I will tell you one last thing that I think.  I think you should not become involved in another relationship for a minimum of 6 months--preferably one year.  During this time, fill your life with role models who will guide you toward your own self-confidence and personal achievement.  Once you have those things in place, you will be very careful and discerning  in terms of whom you pick as a romantic interest.  You will be so well-grounded that if a person comes into your life and then wants to leave the next day, that you will be able to say, "I'm glad this happened now rather than later.  I certainly do not want to be with someone who does not feel the same way about me!
vcgtkAFLaa	HI,  In some ways you could change some of your environment, if you mean by keeping things clean, neat, and doing what you can around you.  You may want to be inside or laying in bed.  You are right, you cannot change your heredity, and that is what we all deal with.    But here are some controls you have:  foods you eat-junk foods or good healthy foods  watching TV on the couch--or going out to play a game with some one.  Riding your bike.  Making sure you have enough sleep.  Trying to keep up on your homework, so you are not stressed over that.  Hygiene and cleanliness--it's up to you to wash and look good.  Taking a walk around the block.  Being in the sun and fresh air a little.  Drinking lots of water and juice and not just soda!!    If you take any maintenance medicine (like allergy pills), make sure you take them so it won't go on to the next level of getting you sick.  Dress accordingly to the weather.  Daily Vitamins.  Try not to overexert yourself--  there are so many things you have control of.  Just look around you and make sure you can keep healthy.    Now Self-esteem has to do with your self-worth, self-dignity, self-respect, and what you feel about yourself.  You should have a good healthy self esteem to know you are a good person that tries to do their best.  You can learn a lot about yourself from self-esteem.  You can learn how you feel about yourself, and how that reflects and helps or hurts others that are close to you.  You can learn why you have certain  characteristics that make you have self-esteem.    As you think about your own self-esteem, you can learn how to treat others so that they will have good self-esteem.    Have fun,  Freewheelingx  :)|`|Aa5uoc7daa	http://kidshealth.org/teen/your_mind/men...

If therefore, there be any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not defer or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again.  ~William Penn      Be an opener of doors for such as come after thee, and do not try to make the universe a blind alley.  ~Ralph Waldo Emerson      The greatest good you can do for another is not just to share your riches but to reveal to him his own.  ~Benjamin Disraeli         We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.  ~Winston Churchill      Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth.  ~Mohammed Ali      The first question which the priest and the Levite asked was:  "If I stop to help this man, what will happen to me?"  But... the good Samaritan reversed the question:  "If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?"  ~Martin Luther King, Jr.      Sometime in your life, hope that you might see one starved man, the look on his face when the bread finally arrives.  Hope that you might have baked it or bought or even kneaded it yourself.  For that look on his face, for your meeting his eyes across a piece of bread, you might be willing to lose a lot, or suffer a lot, or die a little, even.  ~Daniel Berrigan      The Lord loveth a cheerful giver.

However, I think this quote is usually used to mean that their is some lesson to be learned from every experience.   For example, my aunt died.  The CAUSE was cancer.  The lesson or "reason":  That we all eventually die, but hopefully we enriched the lives of others and left the world a better place.   However, I don't think that things happen JUST to make a point or teach a lesson, no matter how good or necessary lesson it may be.    When you stop wanting something, you get it:  Lots of times applied to the search for a soulmate.  I think this just seems to be the case because searching for comapatible people is never an easy task and takes a long time for most folks.  However, it's often when we take the time to reflect on what we are looking for that things seem to come together and we find someone, perhaps this is because we have had the time to decide what is really important to us in another person.    You always love your first love:  I believe when we are truly in love with someone, we never STOP loving them.   The catch here is that we as humans sometimes mistake the strength of our  initial attraction/lust/desire for someone as  LOVE and when those fade we believe we no longer love and maybe even despise that person.  BUT, if those feelings had deeper foundations and were really rooted in love, we may experience the natural changes that occur with love over time -- including things that may cause relationships to fail -- but never really stop LOVING that person.    If you love something set it free:  What this says is not to smother the person you love by being so jealous or possessive that they feel like they are a prisoner.  It doesn't say that if you are in love you should let the other person do whatever he or she wants -- they should respect you and you should have limits of what constitutes freedom in a relationship and you should similarly respect them.  It's best to decide in advance what the limits of various freedoms are in a relationship.  An example is when two people go from casually dating to being exclusive with each other.

gDFC4xm8aa	Here are the steps you need to take to get financial aid:    1)  Fill out the FAFSA. This will determine if you are eligible for financial aid. You can find the FAFSA here:  http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/    2)  Once you are eligible for aid, choose a government-based student loan. The best government loans to get are Federal Perkins Loans. These have low interest rates and the government will help you pay them back as long as you stay enrolled in school. You also don't need a cosigner or good credit for them. Read more here:  http://www.studentfinancedomain.com/stud...    3) The next best loan to get is a Subsidized Stafford Loan. This has many of the same benefits as a Perkins Loan. Read more here;  http://www.studentfinancedomain.com/stud...    4) If you cant get a Perkins Loan or a Subsidized Stafford Loan, then try for Unsubsidized Stafford Loans. These are given to all students, regardless of financial need, and you will have to pay the interest while in school, but they are still better than private college student loans. Read more here:  http://www.studentfinancedomain.com/stud...    You can also try to get a college grant or a college scholarship, which are both free money sources that you can use to pay for school, and you don't have to pay them back.|`|5ypdHLtGaa	try applying for some more scholarships... fastweb.com has a bunch of them listed and they are a reliable site.

It is our bodies and what happens to it needs to be according to our wishes.<br>  <br>  I believe wholeheartedly in organ donations but I am not officially registered as an organ donor, as my children know that if I am not able to be saved, any organs that can be used from my body temple, I agree to be donated.<br>  <br>  I will not make it a rule of thumb, because of corruption that exists in this world.  I may not be saved as a person of presumed more importance may need one of my organs etc....<br>  <br>  So I prefer to allow my children to honour my wishes when nothing can be done to perpetuate my existence on this realm, and my transition is imminent.<br>  <br>  I do not also believe that drivers licences should all have it automatically on them unless a person chooses not to.  <br>  <br>  As people who have limited understanding of English, or generally may not know to UNTICK the choice that has been made for them.  <br>  <br>  As someone who can be a procrastinator I may forget to UNTICK, and then my right to choose is negated.<br>  <br>  But on the POSITIVE:<br>  <br>  Parts of Livers can be disected from living donors to create a whole new liver in the recipient.

Many lives can be saved by the loss of their child. However they have to make the decision very quickly and that can be devestating as well.   <br>  <br>  I also believe that the cells of that person's organs carry a memory of the donor.  Some recipients have found that they act differently, or are drawn to foods they never liked before, but on investigation it was found that the donor liked those foods. One case the recipient fell in love with the wife of the donor, without knowing until later.<br>  <br>  There needs to be strict controls, of donations, as in some third world countries there is a black market in organs, people are being murdered for their organs.<br>     <br>  <br>  I hope  some of this helps...<br>  <br>  Peace and Blessings|`|TduJrZOPaa	information about how long people are on organ waiting lists before they either receive the organ or die would be a strong argument for starters.

Such a paragraph must consist of at least three, and usually more, closely related sentences which clearly introduce your subject and which deal with the subject of the essay. You must avoid such statements as "Virgil is one of the world's greatest writers" (no short college essay could possibly treat that subject, and most college students are not so well-read in world literature as to be competent to make that statement, anyway) or "Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564" (you aren't going to be writing a biography of Shakespeare, after all). Everything in your introduction must clearly introduce the subject of the essay and not appear to be irrelevant to that subject. Include in these sentences facts that are relevant to your subject or give a view which opposes your position plus some evidence which you plan to develop fully later.<br>  <br>  The introductory paragraph must also include the name of the author and the title of the work on which you are writing. If, as may happen on the final examination, you are writing on several works by several authors so that listing all of them may be cumbersome, you may mention only the authors' names in your introduction.One of the sentences in your introduction must be a THESIS SENTENCE or THESIS STATEMENT (i.e., the central purpose or the controlling idea or assertion in your essay, a statement of what you intend to prove). The thesis sentence helps you decide what must be included in your essay and what must be omitted. Unless an essay has a thesis, it has no purpose for being. If you are unable to state your controlling idea in a single sentence, you are not ready to write your essay. (Writing Center tutors can help you talk through your ideas to come up with a thesis. For other prewriting ideas you can try on your own see Writing Process.)<br>  <br>  The thesis statement is not an announcement that you are going to say something ("I am going to write on the character of Odysseus in The Odyssey"). Nor is it a vague assertion about a broad topic ("In his adventures Odysseus displays several important virtues"). The problem in this last example is that the reader is not told what specific virtues you have in mind. You thesis must be a concrete statement in which you set forth an assertion in a single, uncomplicated sentence ("Homer characterizes Odysseus as the ideal Greek king"). Since most essays are written to support your opinion, it might be helpful to think of the thesis as an arguable statement--one that someone may take exception to or argue about. At the very least, the thesis must make a point that calls for support.<br>  <br>  Finally, the introductory paragraph must indicate the order of your argument to show how and in what order you will present evidence to support your thesis. If the purpose of the essay is to prove that Odysseus is a heroic figure, the thesis should simply read, "Odysseus is clearly a heroic figure." In another sentence you need to indicate the kinds of evidence you intend to cite and the order in which that evidence is to be presented (e.g., "Odysseus's heroic qualities include courage, cunning, and loyalty to family"). If your subject is an especially complicated one, you may not be able to indicate the order in a single sentence, and you should not try to do so if that sentence becomes unduly complicated. In such cases you should feel free to indicate the order of your essay in several sentences.<br>  <br>  In any case, readers of your essay must know by the time they finish reading your introductory paragraph (1) the author and the title of the work on which you are writing, (2) your thesis statement--i.e., the point that you are making, and (3) the way in which you are going to organize the body of your essay. An introduction which does not make these matters clear is inadequate.<br>  <br>  Study the sample introductory paragraph below and the analysis of the introduction which follows it.<br>  <br>    Modern readers are often disturbed by the self-centeredness of Achilles, the hero of Homer's The Iliad. Achilles not only withdraws from battle and refuses to support his Greek comrades because of injured pride, but he even hopes that the Trojan enemies will defeat his fellow Greeks. Nevertheless, Homer means for us to see Achilles as an admirable, heroic figure. Homer clearly saw him as the greatest of the warriors at Troy because Achilles has the quality of excellence that was sought after by all Mycenean heroes. To Homer this quality, commonly known as arete, included excellence in all the ways a man could be excellent--physical excellence, moral excellence, and intellectual excellence.<br>  <br>  <br>  This paragraph contains all of the elements which a good introduction must have. It includes the name of the author and the title of the work on which the essay is being written (Homer's The Iliad.) The five sentences in the introduction are clearly related. The first notes that modern readers may not find Achilles

The process of connecting observations to concepts is known as operationalization.  Specifying what we mean when we use certain terms is referred to as conceptualization.  Survey research involves a systematic measurement of observations in order to come up with conclusions that lead to concepts. When we observe objects we understand them in terms of attributes.  These attributes may vary from object to object.  <br>  <br>  <br>  For example if hair is the object then the color would be the attribute.   A variable is understood as a value that changes and is therefore a  logical grouping of attributes.   You can classify every observation in terms of one and only one attribute.  You can not call hair both blond and red but you could call blondish red hair sandy.  The response options we allow survey respondents make a difference in the survey data we collect.  Given the option of classifying blondish red hair either blond or red there will be some that classify it as red and others that classify it as blond.  A neutral response option or allowing your survey respondent to decide the degree to which hair is either blond or red will give you better data to base your conclusions on.

You need to get on a plan for your degree, otherwise you are wasting both time and money. I don't think changing schools will necessarily hurt you in getting a job, but it will take you much longer to finish, and I suppose they may take into consideration that it took you 5, 6, 7 years to finish a bachelor's while other applicants took only 4 years. Who knows, it all comes down to the hiring committee. If you talk to an advisor they should have a nice little sheet or booklet that tells you specifically which classes you have to take to graduate. There will probably be some university required classes, and some degree-specific classes.|`|hyHvG1Olaa	A couple of questions ... Do you have a degree plan?

0U6fSHGOaa	On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was formally established, with its national capital at Beijing. "The Chinese people have stood up!" declared Mao as he announced the creation of a "people's democratic dictatorship." The people were defined as a coalition of four social classes: the workers, the peasants, the petite bourgeoisie, and the national-capitalists. The four classes were to be led by the CCP, as the vanguard of the working class. At that time the CCP claimed a membership of 4.5 million, of which members of peasant origin accounted for nearly 90 percent. The party was under Mao's chairmanship, and the government was headed by Zhou Enlai ( 1898-1976) as premier of the State Administrative Council (the predecessor of the State Council). <br>  <br>  The Soviet Union recognized the People's Republic on October 2, 1949. Earlier in the year, Mao had proclaimed his policy of "leaning to one side" as a commitment to the socialist bloc. In February 1950, after months of hard bargaining, China and the Soviet Union signed the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, valid until 1980. The pact also was intended to counter Japan or any power's joining Japan for the purpose of aggression. <br>  <br>  For the first time in decades a Chinese government was met with peace, instead of massive military opposition, within its territory. The new leadership was highly disciplined and, having a decade of wartime administrative experience to draw on, was able to embark on a program of national integration and reform. In the first year of Communist administration, moderate social and economic policies were implemented with skill and effectiveness. The leadership realized that the overwhelming and multitudinous task of economic reconstruction and achievement of political and social stability required the goodwill and cooperation of all classes of people. Results were impressive by any standard, and popular support was widespread. <br>  <br>  By 1950 international recognition of the Communist government had increased considerably, but it was slowed by China's involvement in the Korean War. In October 1950, sensing a threat to the industrial heartland in northeast China from the advancing United Nations (UN) forces in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), units of the PLA--calling themselves the Chinese People's Volunteers--crossed the YaluJiang () River into North Korea in response to a North Korean request for aid. Almost simultaneously the PLA forces also marched into Xizang to reassert Chinese sovereignty over a region that had been in effect independent of Chinese rule since the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911. In 1951 the UN declared China to be an aggressor in Korea and sanctioned a global embargo on the shipment of arms and war materiel to China. This step foreclosed for the time being any possibility that the People's Republic might replace Nationalist China (on Taiwan) as a member of the UN and as a veto-holding member of the UN Security Council. <br>  <br>  After China entered the Korean War, the initial moderation in Chinese domestic policies gave way to a massive campaign against the "enemies of the state," actual and potential. These enemies consisted of "war criminals, traitors, bureaucratic capitalists, and counterrevolutionaries." The campaign was combined with party-sponsored trials attended by huge numbers of people. The major targets in this drive were foreigners and Christian missionaries who were branded as United States agents at these mass trials. The 1951-52 drive against political enemies was accompanied by land reform, which had actually begun under the Agrarian Reform Law of June 28, 1950. The redistribution of land was accelerated, and a class struggle landlords and wealthy peasants was launched. An ideological reform campaign requiring self-criticisms and public confessions by university faculty members, scientists, and other professional workers was given wide publicity. Artists and writers were soon the objects of similar treatment for failing to heed Mao's dictum that culture and literature must reflect the class interest of the working people, led by the CCP. These campaigns were accompanied in 1951 and 1952 by the san fan ( or "three anti") and wu fan ( or "five anti") movements. The former was directed ostensibly against the evils of "corruption, waste, and bureaucratism"; its real aim was to eliminate incompetent and politically unreliable public officials and to bring about an efficient, disciplined, and responsive bureaucratic system. The wu fan movement aimed at eliminating recalcitrant and corrupt businessmen and industrialists, who were in effect the targets of the CCP's condemnation of "tax evasion, bribery, cheating in government contracts, thefts of economic intelligence, and stealing of state assets." In the course of this campaign the party claimed to have uncovered a well-organized attempt by businessmen and industrialists to corrupt party and government offici|`|AA11199260	China is a self made country. it is going to change the economic environment in the world due to its low cost manufacturing of various items , starting from electronics to any sophisticated items.

TNTFomKeaa	Sentences can be long or short, depending on what you have to say in them. If you are writing a long sentence, you can break it up using commas and clauses. Short sentences are usually easier to read. <br>  When I was younger, I was taught that you put a comma where you would take a breath if you were reading aloud. Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that. That rule is a good starting point but I'd really suggest you get a punctuation book like "Eats shoots and leaves" for more information.<br>  Apostrophes are fairly simple. You use them to signify possession e.g. David's car. If you are using a plural or a name ending with 's', you put the apostrophe after the end e.g. the cows' field (the field belonged to many cows). If the word doesn't end in 's' for the plural, you just use 's as normal e.g. the children's toys.<br>  You also use them to replace a missing letter in a contraction e.g. did not becomes didn't. The apostrophe replaces the 'o'. <br>  A common mistake is to write it's house when you mean that the house belongs to it. It's house means It is house. To show possession for it, you just write its, with no apostrophe. <br>  I hope that helps. I've heard that book I mentioned is really good and easy to understand, and that it will help you to avoid a lot of common mistakes. Good luck!|`|xCbirkdOaa	Apostrophes have two uses:<br>  <br>  Apostrophes show you that some letters have been taken out of a word to shorten it. <br>  Do not becomes don't.<br>  I will becomes I'll.<br>  Could have becomes could've.<br>  The apostrophe goes where the letters have been removed.<br>  You use apostrophes this way in informal writing. You should not shorten words when you are writing formal letters.<br>  NOTE - sometimes words are shortened in an irregular way. The apostrophe, however, is still used to show where letters are missing.<br>  E.G: Will not becomes won't.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Apostrophes show you that something belongs to something else. To show belonging you add 's <br>  The cat's tail - says that the tail belongs to the cat.<br>  The car's lights - says that the lights belong to the car.<br>  Tony's hair - says that the hair belongs to Tony.<br>  <br>  Usually the apostrophe goes before the s.<br>  If the owner already ends in s then the apostrophe goes after the s that is already there. You just need to add an apostrophe. Eg:<br>  <br>  The dogs' bowls - says that the bowls belong to some dogs.<br>  The boys' coats - says that the coats belong to some boys.<br>  The cars' wheels - says that the wheels belong to some cars.<br>  <br>  Watch out for plurals that don't end in s. Words like men and children don't end in s, but they are talking about lots of people. These words use 's to show possession. E.G:<br>  <br>  The men's hats - says that the hats belong to the men.<br>  The women's house - says that the house belongs to the women.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  We use commas in two main ways:<br>  <br>  Commas separate the items in a list. <br>  Sometimes these items are real things.<br>  E.g. I need some pens, pencils, paper and a calculator before I start my class. <br>  I must buy some eggs, milk, sugar and tea. <br>  <br>  Sometimes these items are things you do, or places you go.<br>  E.g. Yesterday I went to work, played badminton, went to the pub and then went to bed. <br>  I'm going to spend my holiday walking on the beach, sleeping in the sun and reading my book. <br>  <br>  BEWARE!<br>  Always make sure you use and to separate the last two items in your list.<br>  Make sure that you don't use a comma before the word and at the end of your list.<br>  <br>  Don't use commas where you should use a full-stop. If the words could stand alone as a proper sentence then you need to put a full-stop or a joining word ('and', 'but' etc) in and not a comma.<br>  'Yesterday I went to work, I walked the dog, I went shopping and I washed the car.' <br>  This doesn't work as these could all stand alone as proper short sentences. If you want to write them as a list (for example, to show you were in a hurry, or that you had a lot to do) take out the 'I'.<br>  'Yesterday I went to work, walked the dog, went shopping and washed the car.' <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Commas mark out the less important part of a sentence. <br>  This is a useful way to make your sentences more interesting by adding extra information.<br>  E.g. The car, which was parked by the light, had a dog in the back seat. <br>  This sentence is about the car and the dog, it's not about where the car was parked.<br>  <br>  Tony, his mum's favourite, was given chocolate cake for tea. <br>  This sentence is about Tony eating chocolate cake. We don't need 'his mum's favourite' for the sentence to make sense, it's extra information.<br>  <br>  Rajinda, the youngest in the family, is about to get married. <br>  This sentence is about Rajinda getting married, it's not about her position in the family.<br>  <br>  HOW CAN I CHECK?<br>  A quick way to check this second use of commas is to see if the sentence makes sense without the words between the commas.<br>  The first sentence -<br>  'The car, which was parked by the light, had a dog in the back seat.' <br>  would become <br>  'The car ____ had a dog in the back seat.' <br>  This sentence makes sense so the commas are in the right places.

cGnIZ7kfaa	OH MY GOD. I HAD TO DO THIS LAST YEAR. Ill say one thing...<br>  <br>  Im so sorry you have to go through this! Journeys is the most annoying topic! Wow. Man its annoying. Ill totally help you out!<br>  <br>  Ok, so you have your physical journeys, inner journeys, psychological journeys, emotional journeys... A lot about journeys is growing up. Changing. Epiphanies are very important. Write about a time in your life where you had an epiphany.<br>  Ill give you some examples of mine...<br>  "When you give advice to someone, just offer it, dont expect them to take it and dont latch on to them constantly handing out helpful hints, or theyll just drop you and make you feel unappreciated". <br>  And... "Being your own person, having a mind of your own, mond over matter" They all seem ike cliches, but when you experience something that can relate to these sayings, you realise they are taken for granted.<br>  Write about a time where you realised you were being controlled and eventually came to realise you are your own property and you could easily walk out of the situation like THAT. Make it up if you have to.<br>  How youve grown from the experience- Well, Use the quote "The way foward is sometimes the way back" and towards the end of your story reflect on your past and your future and mention how you have benefited from it and what you have lost. <br>  Also, this will be good. Mention thiungs that relate to the story that you still have to change and work on, and finish off on a humorous note followed by "But all that is going to be another journey" Or reword it. The teacher will like how you have ran around a bit on the grass rather than just walked on the sidewalk. And yes, loads of metaphors!<br>  English teachers suck up metaphors like mushrooms.<br>  You could base the whole essay on one witty or profound metaphor.<br>  the experience was like a card game... for example....<br>  and write the whole thing as if its a stressful poker game and you have to keep poker faces. its good cause you can incorportate emotional journeys into that.<br>  thats an example, think of another if you like.<br>  well... here are some phrases your english teacher will tick in that deliciously bright red pen that only looks good when it tics something...<br>  <br>  "self discovery"<br>  "finding ones self"<br>  "theres more to it than a beginning and an end. it's like a sandwich. you eat it for whts on the inside".<br>  or a kinder suprise. those are AWESOME! anyway...<br>  re evaluation of ones psyche<br>  reinvention of ones self<br>  new person<br>  rebirth of ones self from this journey<br>  "i once was blind but now i see"<br>  seeing things in a new light.<br>  <br>  well i hope i helped.<br>  i got Bs but after a lot of talking with my teacher i figured out how to get an A<br>  i hope you have fun...<br>  om your...<br>  journey.<br>  <br>  <br>  lol. sorry, i had to do it.<br>  lol.|`|AA10706358	First you need to forget it's a home work.. you need to write your journey for yourself like if you were writing a diary, journal.. etc<br>  just write what you feel<br>  Then you take what you wrote and try to "butter up" the words to meet the standards of your essay.. put some more profound words like if you were editing your own story..<br>  I hope I helped|`|k4LHPz2uaa	Mail honestessays@gmail.com for professional help.

O3CrGKw4aa	Although some small airlines hire high school graduates, most airlines require at least 2 years of college and prefer to hire college graduates. In fact, most entrants to this occupation have a college degree. Because the number of college-educated applicants continues to increase, many employers are making a college degree an educational requirement. For example, test pilots often are required to have an engineering degree.<br>  <br>  Pilots also need flight experience to qualify for a license. Completing classes at a flight school approved by the FAA can reduce the amount of flight experience required for a pilot’s license. In 2006, the FAA certified about 600 civilian flying schools, including some colleges and universities that offer degree credit for pilot training. Initial training for airline pilots typically includes a week of company indoctrination; 3 to 6 weeks of ground school and simulator training; and 25 hours of initial operating experience, including a check-ride with an FAA aviation safety inspector. Once trained, pilots are required to attend recurrent training and simulator checks once or twice a year throughout their career.<br>  <br>  Licensure. To qualify for FAA licensure, applicants must be at least 18 years old and have at least 250 hours of flight experience.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	anything engineering related<br>  from then on, just gain a PPL and ATPL and you're sorted|`|ygGr1nX7aa	I don't know about the USA, but in the UK you don't need a degree to qualify as a commercial pilot.

ljo6Z5amaa	Bilas Rao Pardesi (Irrfan Khan), nicknamed Billu, is a barber in Budbuda, a fictional village in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. He and his wife Bindiya (Lara Dutta) and their children Gunja (Mitali Mayakar) and Duggu (Pratik Dalvi) live in poverty, with Billu unable to even pay his children's school tuition. A man of pride and humility, he refuses to borrow money from local landlord Daamchand (Om Puri).<br>  <br>  When Bollywood superstar Sahir Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) comes to this village to shoot his latest film, Billu's family, who believe that Khan is an old friend of Billu, pester Billu for an introduction. Gradually the news spreads and soon the whole village is after him for some chance of a meeting with Khan. The school even says it will pay Billu's children's tuition through 12th grade in return for Billu inviting Khan to a school function. Daamchand decides to finance (without being asked) new chairs, new equipment and new toileteries for Billu's Saloon in return for Billu inviting Sahir to Daamchand's place for dinner. Laakhu (Rajpal Yadav) wants a meeting with Khan to be given a chance to compose lyrics for films.<br>  <br>  Despite Billu's efforts at turning people away, telling his family privately that Khan would never remember him, Billu finds himself pushed to make contact — and is met with either stern rebukes by Khan's secretary or security forces. When a riot breaks out at the filming location, Billu is arrested for fooling people.<br>  <br>  When the school function occurs, Khan, asked by local functionaries, does indeed appear. He announces his struggle in life and claims he owes his career to a childhood friend named Billu. In an emotional speech, he describes the friendship in detail, and bemoans having lost track of Billu when Billu moved away from their hometown. Learning that his childhood friend now lives right here, Khan visits Billu's house and promises to keep in touch and to live their lives together again. Billu again becomes the hero of the village.<br>  <br>  I would give it 6.5/10|`|TuGkVqwraa	I will give 7/10.

If a teacher is nice, some students  will not respect that teacher and they will misbehave.<br>  <br>  Your teacher is mean because being mean has worked for this teacher in the past.<br>  Some teachers feel they need to be mean to get the students to behave and follow directions.<br>  Your teacher spends a lot of time reminding students not to tap their pencils on the desk, throw spit-balls, hit people, talk while the teacher talks, kick the seat in front of them, make unnecessary noises, etc.<br>  <br>  People are afraid of angry/rude people and tend to comply with their wishes to avoid being on the receiving end of that hostility.<br>  <br>  Some children learn from their parents that you don't need to take your parents seriously until they get mad and start yelling. These children tend NOT to obey the teacher until the teacher yells or gets mad.<br>  <br>  My advice to the student: Don't take it personally. Your teacher is mean to everyone they come into contact with.  When you go to class, you need to follow directions and try not to give the teacher any reasons for sending anger your way.

lA0e6vWxaa	Humm..let me give this a shot here...sounds like you have a picture perfect life, beauty and popularity (Your mom taking a picture of you, you being a model).  Things are going to come in your life that will give you a challenge and test your relationship with those closes to you.  Although tides and relationship with love ones will be tested, it will not be broken for blood is thicker than water. In the dream your dad might be protecting you from something that you think is right, that you feel is right, but it's not right for you. You may have to die within yourself first before you can see the clearer picture.|`|WvqRJow1aa	Daddy doesn't think so.
