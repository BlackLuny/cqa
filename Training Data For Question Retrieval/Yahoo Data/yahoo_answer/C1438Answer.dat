5d3cce618f57b550f9f5b932c6752b1aaa	Hmm... I would suppose they will all come to you in a time of need... But I'm not completely sure, you might want to consult a psychic if you're truly concerned.|`|7i9ncEBdaa	Have those people been through emotional problems? That could be your subconscious telling you you think they're hurting. If you think you're related to their being hurt somehow, you could be feeling guilty.     If you're trying to help them, but fail, your subconscious may be saying you need to stop butting into other peoples' business in real life, or, if you try and fail in real life, that it does not think you can help them.    If you try to help them and succeed, but try and fail in waking life, your subconscious may be telling you not to give up.    The wheelchair may represent something keeping them going, as in, if they are hurting in real life, whatever it is that keeps them from going over the edge.    In the dreams, if the wheelchairs disappear or are damaged, this may be your subconscious warning you that whatever's keeping these people okay is failing, or your subconscious thinks it will.    If they acquire the wheelchairs in the dreams, your subconscious may be telling you something is helping them. Does someone give them the wheelchair? Maybe the person giving them the chair is whom your subconscious believes is helping them (this could be you), or the person giving them the chair could represent someone else entirely (for example, if it's your father, but your father does not even know this person, it could mean your brother or boyfriend).|`|rS5oHNGjaa	nothing watsoever.|`|9s7Uf2w6aa	they'll probly all be in wheelchaires soon!!!!!|`|F9JdzpfYaa	Dreams are hard to interpret, since i have no idea what is going on in your life.

M4fiDYE6aa	no, even a guy using eyeliner turns me on|`|tkhBJMmhaa	Chapstick yes thats awesome i hate dry lips.  Compact uuuuuhhhhhh no I think that would make me think again..|`|W0S7gQDaaa	No, its not like you use friggin lip gloss and if a girl thinks it is then their asking for too much in a guy. if ur using a compact- u kno wat dont even use a compact just use a mirror, a normal mirror.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	Heck no. Guys with nasty chapped lips are disgusting. It's like kissing sandpaper or a piece of peeling sunburnt skin. I like a man who takes care of himself with something as simple as *chapstick*.    Seriously, if anyone thinks having nasty chapped lips makes one masculine, they're confusing masculinity with poor hygiene.    Hey, and if you care about your looks, I don't see the harm in carrying around a small mirror. I don't, but I used to when I had things on my face that ran, melted, and smeared.|`|UspK4SQBaa	No.|`|V1MptCMiaa	No, putting chapstick on is fine.  I don't want to see nasty chapped lips.  But it is a turnoff to see a guy with a compact, let alone seeing him use it, to put on chapstick.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	No.  Which is better to kiss- lips with a little chapstick or dry, crackly, peely lips?|`|rD5HyZyeaa	My boyfriend has dry lips and it can be a turn off. I'd prefer he used chapstick.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I've never seen a man using a chapstick, but I don't think it would bother me unduly.  However, if he used a compact I would frankly find that a little strange.|`|AA12219135	I'm not a woman but if I saw a guy using a compact to apply chap stick, I'd be leary of him, lol|`|uhchod38aa	Chapstick is better than chapped lips.|`|VghVdPfsaa	No, to me it's fine once and a while to keep the lips soft. But if I see them just sitting there applying it every minute like I do, I might stay away...|`|rpajoT0raa	Not at all. The fact that he's using a chapstick means he cares about keeping his lips in good condition. All the better for kissing  :)|`|mnXxJtqmaa	umm yes the chap stick no  but hunny if you use a compact mirror to apply it  then.... your not  a `man`.|`|yUMH5u6daa	Why would he need a compact to put on chapstick? I just think he'd be stupid and stupid men turn me off.|`|JHasLcn3aa	Chapstick = Completley Normal.    Compact= Steer Clear...unless he is with a girl, a mirror is a mirror. unless its his own|`|qPlx1Ejhaa	About 2 months ago I was using one of those clear sunblock chapsticks. My girlfriend saw me and let out an eeewwwwww!  Now I feel self-conscious about doing it in public.|`|AA12336246	Chapstick is fine, but as it is clear, why the hell would he need a compact. It would be a turn off for me.|`|LR48Rtv2aa	Using a compact, yes. Putting on chapstick, no.    I like when guys put on chapstick.  There is nothing worse than seeing a guy with lips cracking, peeling and bleeding.  Being a man isn't an excuse to have chapped lips, crusty feet, or just down right bad hygiene :)

It's the art of the snub?|`|sTSBk9jhaa	There could of been something that had him upset the day you dressed up. It would have to take several times to see if this is consistent.|`|QxEGfQi5aa	some people tend to be ignorant, thinking this would drive the girl to come towards him.  Or he would have got turned on and was fantasizing you in his mind when you dressed attractive. And this guilt made him not to face you directly.
lsmk8gEGaa	you're worried something big, out of your control will take something important away from you and you will be helpless to stop it from happening. And that what will be in its place is chaos. The human falling is a helpless you, the Greek letters mean you don't understand what is happening or may happen. Praying for a death not painful and the act of death is you not wanting to face the thing or situation that is bothering you, you are trying to avoid it and death is the ultimate way to avoid the inevitable.    Do you have a big change coming in your life? a move or a change in your job or a graduation from college or something?

But your question is really stupid with the million dollar comments, so it's not worth educating you. It will do more than the republicans idea of giving money to those who already have it.|`|iHFZLsDTaa	Actually, that is a good plan.

Ig3arFxraa	Whatever the dream you have is about, try to enjoy it and if you are aware that you are dreaming, try to control small things first. Then you can control your dreams and nothing bad can ever happen.    Plus, you can have 2 or 3-part dreams over different nights (if you think about the previous part before you fall asleep)!|`|tTIXhe7daa	Have a good day and you might have a good dream.|`|egLhVY35aa	i am not sure if this works... but...  try thinking of good things and happy thought before you fall asleep|`|wyXCRGv6aa	there is no way to control your dreams, as far as i know or can tell.|`|OmffRGCQaa	idk i usually have strawberry milk because i don't like chocolate..........|`|7BZYUHpjaa	im not sure if that is possible but i would try thinking good and happy thoughts and make sure you aren't stressed or anything before going to bed|`|YCvgjLdnaa	you control your dreams by what is going on in your life, and what you're thinking about and feeling in your mind.   you usually focus on the bad things in your life, so unfortunatly thats whats on your mind and so the only way to have good dreams is to have a good life...  try not looking at bad points and focus on good things in your life. If you make your life positive, your dreams will be too :)  xxx
briRpzL1aa	Thats easy... Do more of it..  The reason you are shy is because you have a lack of experience in doing it.   Meaning, the more you do it, the better you will become.     The way you do this is to start forcing yourself to walk up to people and start talking.  Yes you will find stupid at first, and yes people will make comments.  Just keep your head up, and keep trying.  After a while it will become second nature.  In fact, I used to be shy as well, but now I am called "Mr. Mayor" in most settings because I talk to people so much..    Good Luck and I Hope this Helps..|`|jM3BSbYyaa	You have to quite literally throw yourself into those situations till eventually it becomes second nature =D good luck.

f9d88043d8ba88ae6d8cec415fe76179aa	Think of a recession as a push and a depression as a shove.|`|16F7DelAaa	Recession is a countries gross domestic product reducing for two quarters, and a depression is a recession that last for a longer period of time, like over 8-12 months. Also a depression also has abnormally high unemployment rates, and severe restriction of credit.|`|tgMIvZepaa	A recession is when you go window shopping and  keep your wallet closed, a depression is when the windows are closed and your wallet is empty.|`|M3Xmqlt8aa	Recession effects us, Depression effects the richy rich corperations and banks.|`|0YQRbq9faa	Recession is an economic slow down and down turn.  Depression is an economic explosion like the Great Depression of the 30's.|`|Mcr4IS6Vaa	Economics is a very complicated topic, so if you really want the full answer, just take 5 to read this. I'll try to be as brief as possible    The way economics work is that things go up in price overtime, generally products get more expensive than services. This process is called inflation. Economics allows inflation till the point where nobody wants to pay for anything, and then people start losing jobs due to the expense to keep them. This is called a recession. When things start to get normal again, inflation starts again. And this keeps going. That is generally what happens overtime, and recessions happen about every 5-10 years.    There have only been two true depressions since 1901, and those are The Great Depression (1924-1930) and The Global Financial Crisis which has been going on since 2005. A depression is just a term for when the process of inflation lasts for longer than expected and then the interest rates really cut down low. In our current depression, the rates are tipped to dive lower than how they did in 1964 when the Reserve Bank cut it to 2.4%.    Queensland Treasurer, Andrew Fraser has been tipped off by Kevin Rudd about a second economy bonus for Australian accounts to help with when the interest rates do come down. However, Australian economists predict The Global Financial Crisis will end between the year 2011 and 2016.|`|uiKAI8bWaa	It was never mine either.

Am I right?|`|cHaRg3fkaa	Simplest definition of a recessoin is two consecutive quarters of declining Gross National Product (GNP).  The Business Cycle definition is more complex.  A depression happens when GNP delines by 10% or more over a period of time.  These are the simplest definitions.  However, the answer cen be complex depending on the yardstick used for mesauring declining activity as GNP is but one of the macro indicators of economic health.|`|1Gj0uKxzaa	It's fuzzy. A depression is just a deep recession that goes on for a long time.
rYdEVC0xaa	I shouldn't say totally detach yourself from them, but you need to realize that if you want to make it through to college, live with what you have right now. deal with the fact that your parents behavior is not to your liking, invent your own behavior. it is not as difficult as it seems. like it or not anyway, some of your parents behavior, good or bad, will be reflected, even if just a tiny bit, on your personality. it happens and there's not much to do about that, but you can shift how their actions affect the way you operate down the road, once your out of the house. Use the principles you learn from your own situations, do not focus on what your parents do. We all form our own personality with part of it being hereditary. my point is, keep an eye out for your obstacles, not theirs. it'll let you learn by yourself|`|YCvgjLdnaa	If you're just looking to get all your emotions and anger out then i think the best way is to write it down. write everything you feel in your  own words, it really helps.

It really sucks because through the system it takes months and costs thousands, when one could otherwise pick up a DIY test kit at the drug store and send the samples to the lab for about $120.00.     It does however make sense that the women make it difficult when you factor in the stat that 30-40% of contested paternitys are found to be fraudulent claims against the man.|`|cflktD34aa	what legal system? you dont say what country you are from.|`|omYoOmSlaa	If you're questioning the U.S. legal system, the answer is yes. Paternity tests are required when the state sues the alleged father for child support. A blood test will then determine probability that the man is child's father. High probability = he owes the state money and wages may be garnished to pay child support.|`|5b97d2edb86616427fbc10f6f183478faa	yes|`|NhMfGXmxaa	In my state it's required.|`|tkhBJMmhaa	Almost every state requires DNA when you are trying to get child support.

a1cMDuDsaa	Just the fact that you desire to be a better person shows that you truly are a genuine person. Don't get down, we all have rough patches that we must get through in our lives. Jumping the obstacles is part of what makes us who we are. (I know it sounds cheesy, but it really is true.)     I believe we all have the qualities that you listed about yourself. But you sound to me like the type of girl who is extra hard on herself. Forgive yourself. You are human. I also think that since you are so hard on yourself and carry so much guilt about it, you may have depression. It is one of the many symptoms. Look at the link I added on and see if you might have depression. Even if you don't have depression, I would talk to a counselor sometime. Don't be ashamed about this, we all need to have someone to talk through our pain, and who better than a professional? If you have any more questions come back to Yahoo! We are here for you!

Reading good books will allow you to have an insight into many different lives and situations and perhaps let you understand what people around you might be thinking.    this is my favorite book of all time and basically puts you into someone's mind (who is pretty down on himself, as you are):  http://www.gutenberg.org/files/600/600-h...    For the other things, i think if you really really do want to be a better person then you definitely can as long as it is what you really want. If you don't really want to then you probably wont be able to.  Once you understand yourself, you will find it easier to understand other people, too!|`|AA11216736	look at things as though you were them and you will feel empathetic or sympathetic. if you dont then i guess you haven't gone through what the person is goin thru or you just are a very strong person who cant feel empathetic and sympathetic to people who you think are weak.    just try trusting someone out of the blue. hopefuly it wont go bad but you got to have risk in your life. we trust the world just by living in it. we trust the world it wont kill us in the middle of the night. i think you do trust but you just dont realize it. if we didn't have trust at all we would all be suicidal. dont tell yourself you never will trust some one cause you will. you are showing trust right know by hoping someone on yahoo answers will answer  you.     yes it is possible to change who you are. nothing is impossible if you work really hard to make something happen. its how the human race works.    make new friends . make new friends who feel the same way you feel.  work hard to change yourself and you will get there. know that you wont feel the way you feel forever. nothing lasts forever. some way or another you will change its natural.    ps  do good things out of the blue you dont have to feel sympathetic to do good things it doesnt make you bad to not be sympathetic. share your feelings with someone. try to make friends everyone is a lot more mature and they wont tease you. you will make a friend eventually if you try.|`|igI5yX0vaa	Don't try to change too much at one time.

You need to realize that its experience that makes you who you are so if you want to change the person you are then you need to change your life!|`|3FL3zIKsaa	Well, you're already half way there by realizing your mistakes.  People can change negative things about themselves by trying a little harder.  Just try to think things through more.   Try to look at things through the eyes of someone else and how they might feel about the situation.   Think of things not only how you'd feel if someone did it to you, but how that person, being a lot more sensitive than you, may feel about it.  Once you start trying harder to do small things for people and take other people's feelings into consideration more, things can come more naturally.

lOenOZcBaa	Maybe you sense in the back of your mind that one of your friends likes this boy. You feel there is some sort of competition to win him, and the fact you both had the same dress means you're both great candidates to him. But you sense that if she were his girlfriend, that she wouldn't treat him right and call him names if he ever did anything wrong.    Basically, you're afraid of competition, or afraid that this boy will fall into the wrong hands.     Thats just an amateur dream interpretation, and thats what I got out of it.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	You are the 2 girls that's why same dress a part of you wants him to be with you & cuddle lean on you but your other half sees him as a Mamas' boy  & this side of him bothers you  the scary movie shows you are afraid of losing him

Rarely will I ask for help, and in the rare occasions that I have, women have acted really put out by it, which was a real disappointment.|`|PwvU3LQBaa	Ok, I got my husband a gift last year for Valentines Day.  That was the day he got off of work after being gone for 2 weeks.  He didn't even come home to see me til later on in the day.  He went with his friends he had seen on the boat for the 2 weeks.  All I wanted was for him to come home.  He didn't get me anything.  So what.  He did feel bad that I got him something and he didn't and didn't come back home when he got off.      I help my dad fix up his houses for rent and he pays me, so I do have my own money.  I am a SAHM, but do this to get extra income.  I get my husband presents and get me presents too.  That is how it works.    I have paid for dates as well.  We have gone out to eat and a movie and I have paid.    I got my son from a previous relationship because my ex left the state.  DUH    I compliment people in general.  I like to make people feel good about themselves, so why not.    I hold the door for everyone who needs it, and I would hope to get the same courtesy back.    As far as making the first move I have stated in here already that I made the first move with my husband.  I asked him to dance and it just went from there.    I don't do fundraisers either.    I am not that emotional and I would never tell anyone to get in touch with their emotions.  If you are going to do that, do it in private where no one can see you.  I don't like showing my emotions myself.    As for the Titanic, I wasn't even born yet so I had no control over it.  I wouldn't go first.  I am able bodied and I would make sure that the ones on the lifeboats first were children then everyone else.      My daughter will be treated the same as my son.  If she falls down and scrapes her knee, I will tell her the same thing I tell my son.  Get up and walk it off, it's not that bad.

As for women there always ready to give a piece of their heart away.     I mean just look at statistics, which gender is always starting wars, committing major felonies like: Murder, Rape, Robbery, Manslaughter, Assault and Battery,Sexual battery,Burglary, Kidnapping, Stalking, and Hate Crimes .......yup MEN!    Chivalry is dead, and that's the way it should be. Unless you live in some kind of Podunk little town.      This was more present in men, back in the 50's. They would always show women chivalry gestures, but would later beat them behind close doors. So what the hell is the point??? Real women have careers or can survive without a man holding their hand.  I'm not saying all men are like this, but the majority are.    Edit:  Christian J.   I'm not a man hater and I'm certainly not a FEMINIST. I hate those type of women. They never know how to choose a battle.    I'M JUST A PERSON WHO LOOKS AT STATISTICS!!! PERHAPS YOUR  A PERSON WHO'S JUST IN DENIAL (?)    Like if your going to call me a man hater then why don't you call this dude a women hater or a gay?????      Obviously you people no nothing about statistics (4 IN 5 OFFENDERS ARE MALE).    Men outnumber women in all major crime categories. Between 85 and 95 per cent of offenders found guilty of burglary, robbery, drug offenses, criminal damage or violence against the person are male.  98 per cent of people found guilty of, or cautioned for, sexual offenses are male.      Men commit more violent crimes than women do. The relationship between sex and crime is well-known and has persisted over time. This mean that communities with a higher ratio of men to womenwhat sociologists call the sex ratiowill have HIGHER crime rates?    Sociologists Steven Messner, from SUNY-Albany, and Robert Sampson, from the University of Chicago,        * Having a higher sex ratio tends to increase violent crime because men are more likely than women to commit violent crime.      * Having a higher sex ratio tends to decrease crime because it reduces the "marriage squeeze" faced by women looking for a spouse. Less family disruption leads to less crime.    (SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA A WOMEN IS RAPED EVERY 2 MINUTES)    Approximately 28% of victims are raped by husbands or boyfriends, 35% by acquaintances, and 5% by other relatives. (Violence against Women, Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Dept. of Justice,    The FBI estimates that only 37% of all rapes are reported to the police.    Family violence and abuse are among the most prevalent forms of interpersonal violence against women and young children -- both boys and girls. The sexual abuse of a child should never be "just a family matter," but many children are afraid to report an incident to the police because the abusers are too often a family friend or relative.    Approximately one-third of all juvenile victims of sexual abuse cases are children younger than 6 years of age. (Violence and the Family, Report of the American Psychological Association Presidential Task Force on Violence and the Family, 1996.)    According to the Justice Department, one in two rape victims are under age 18; one in six are under age 12. (Child Rape Victims, 1992. U.S. Department of Justice.)         * Approximately 73% of rape victims know their assailants.      * Only 6% of rapists will ever spend a day in jail.    1 in 10 rape victims are men. (Rathus, Nevid and Fichner-Rathus, 568)    "SO MEN ARE NOT ONLY DOING THIS TO WOMEN BUT THEY ARE ALSO DOING THIS TO OTHER MEN AND BOYS."  : O : O : O    Plus most women must resort to abortion b/c its a direct result of the father. Many women are forced by the father to get an abortion. Either the father doesn't want to take care of the child, or can't stand the mother. As you may call it....... The selfishness of some men, comes into great effect in this case.     I say, everyone keep your pants on!!!! (men or women)|`|218674f9b2d2e3a11ef1ff1afe9cc981aa	Women are definitely more superficial.  When a detectice agency hires a female decoy to see if the husband will cheat, she doesn't even have to be that particularly attractive.  But when the agency hires a male decoy to see if the wife will cheat, the man has got to be devastatingly handsome.|`|gKCJLyIbaa	"Absolutely not, men are buffers....always absorbing everything as if no one else matters but them. As for women there always ready to give a piece of their heart away.    I mean just look at statistics, which gender is always committing major felonies, starting wars, and is most likely to be a murder.......yup MEN!"    WOW !!!    Don't have to look too far to find the male-haters !!    Have a look at the 1.5 million unborn that are murdered each year at the instigation of women and now tell me how great your sex is. Feminists like yourself are not only extremely hypercritical but absolutely refuse to look at women generally for the wrong they do in society..    Women are not held accountable as much as men are. Violence and murder has actually decreased over the last few year but female violence has increased by 250% over the same period..    But you don't want to know about that, do we..|`|mZVk3fP4aa	I just wish you would get in touch with logic and reason, because if you were capable of these you would see that women are too. You get your pathetic little ego pumped by thinking you're intellectually superior to women, when nothing could be farther from the truth. Men on here try to claim it's just women who think with their glands. If that's true why is it men like you who cling to stupid stereotypes instead of getting the facts. If you're an equalist, I'm a Nobel Peace Prize winner!|`|62ZBofvPaa	Most of what you are listing is a bunch of anecdotes and relationship bs, in which women are not taught to be forward in their romances and are taught to be virginal and all that stuff, while men pursue them...it has jack **** to do with "selflessness".  A guy who opens a door or buys candy to get into a girls pants isn't "selfless".   A guy who buys candy for a random person, who he won't ever see again?--THAT is selfless.  A man who gives up his job and his social life to take care of kids and clean for his whole life--THAT is selfless.  A man who goes into low-paying work, like teaching, childcare, or nursing in order to improve his community--THAT is selfless.    Women are more susceptible to selfless behavior...they donate more money, have more empathy and are more socially-oriented.  (See studies--one requires registration but it's pretty good).  Not that men don't do selfless things also.    Edit: Good point to whoever brought up crime rates like that...I'm sorry, but I can't think of a thing more selfish than murder.  "Oh noes, I saw a girl slam a door in some guys face!!!"  ...yea well my cousin got murdered by 2 guys.     But it's stupid...a selfish person is a selfish person regardless of gender.|`|8c588f73595e6a75b68bbeae9011c8d1aa	ITS OKAY  I like to treat my "to be" woman that way:P  but you have great points  a great question  but not a good place to ask    They make food for us though|`|Y9kHh7Ryaa	i think girls|`|BuP1JlIxaa	ive met alot of selfish people in school, and a lot were women.|`|uhchod38aa	You put a lot of thought into this, didn't you?

My father moreso than my mother.|`|ewybA08Iaa	No.  The decision to choose to acquire a priority is based on the value of the issue.  Males no longer have a social responsibility to put females first in the event of a life threatening emergency.  Children are the priority.  After the kids are secured, then an orderly evacuation is the priority.  The physically impaired are assisted and moved to the head of the line.  Males and females have equal value and actually should assist each other.  Males have wives and kids that need them too.  Females are tougher than portrayed.   Survival is more likely when cooperation is enacted.|`|TRZNCxGzaa	in life, women are the takers and the consumers. men are the givers and the creators|`|NhMfGXmxaa	You have no evidence for any of this. It means nothing.|`|YQOT68xFaa	-True for some women but not all. My dad always got my mom roses for Valentine's Day and my mom always got him a gift too (I can't remember what she got him though; I just remember the big bouquet of roses).  -My husband paid for our dates when we were not yet married. He wanted to; I never pressured him and would have paid. Some men *like* doing that. Not all women expect it, either. Stop generalizing.  -Yeah, that sucks, but it's a two-fold problem. Women are part of the problem (lying about their ex, for example...), and a skewed legal system that almost always just takes her word for it is the other part.  -Not true. Women compliment men all the time. Maybe you personally don't....but you aren't all men.  ; )  -Another generalization, since you have no idea what most women do or do not care about.  -Not all men do that, and not all women are so rude as to refuse to hold the door or let it slam in someone's face. Stop generalizing!  -I don't know about that one because I am not out there in the dating scene. I suspect it isn't so one-sided as you think though.  -Somewhat true. Men get their butt handed to them if they dare imply that a woman is being emotional or illogical. I don't know if that's proof that women are more selfish, or just proof that we really are as emotional as men say we are!  -That just proves that there are a few stupid women out there who don't understand what happened aboard the Titanic and assume that the women forced the men to stay. Not too bright but it doesn't reflect on the rest of us, just on themselves.    In short. I think you are generalizing in a big way here. Yes, there are some very selfish women out there. But there are also alot of selfish men. Why else do you think so many guys will ditch a woman once they knock her up?    EDIT - People mention the crime rate, as if that is proof that men are somehow worse than women. They aren't. Women commit crimes too. Men may start wars, but women kill their unborn children and are more likely to abuse their kids. How the heck is that a sign that we are less selfish?? Abortion is the ultimate act of selfishness.    Oh and this:  "Real women have careers and can take care of themselves."  So a career is the mark of a "real woman" is it? So no homemaker or at-home mom is a "real woman", eh? Riiiiiight. You think that if it makes you feel better.|`|svOneExjaa	Let me get it straight: you strongly dislike women and don't feel like getting Valentine's gift for women in your life, right? LOL. Please, don't: hold the doors, buy gifts, complement and etc. us, we will survive without you putting yourself out. I can't promise you though, that any female will stick around long enough to give you a 'lame kiss' on your forehead after all that. Females always have choices. Why would any girl (you call them women, but they are girls) give you a time of the day, when she can always find another male without obsession with male superiority and female inadequacy, someone who aims to please. And she wouldn't have to go far for him. World is full of men miles better than you, dear. And all women / girls know that information firsthand.    Edit @ little boy who calls himself an "Equalist": I   am not interested in how close to home my own statements hit you; you can always go and cry on your momma's shoulder. Now, I don't hate men, I am happily married to one of them for last 19 years and a very dear friend to 12 others. I take care of my own family and my sick father, while running a multimillion dollar company single handedly established by me. I went through my life with self respect and an open mind. People of both genders are attracted to that. I also had never heard of anyone as whiny and as senseless as you are. You operate on stereotypes and assumptions of strangers and it makes perfect sense to you somehow. The thing is that when people have real life relationships, they don't find things you are so obsessively concern yourself with disturbing in any way or form. It is a part of life. We simply deal with it. We manage to enjoy company of other people no matter how "unfair" some of these relationships are. FYI: there are two types of personalities in the world: givers and takers. Givers are the very best partners in life, because they don't sit there calculating how much good they did in life and how much the world at large owes them for it. All that non-sense is done by takers, who are negligent, rude and whiny. Therefore they should be avoided with the most caution: they bring intense pain to everyone they come in contact with. Now, you also have a pretty malicious side to you, and that tells me that you have been rejected quite a bit in your short and pathetic life. So, after all that said and done women in your life are not as stupid as you would like them to be. Talking about report monkeys: are you going to report my answer AGAIN, because having an intelligent discussion is something you are unable to master? LOL    Edit at a little boy who calls himself an "Equalist": Smile. You are pathetic and very young. Thankfully not every male is as silly as you are, that is why I personally adore men. Not all of them, but the intelligent, well mannered and respectful variety. The people you know absolutely nothing of. Imagine that some of us have absolutely no need to invent anything about our lives, the reality of it simply accedes our and your dreams and hopes. I am not bitter; after all I am not the one constantly whining about men or any gender in general. That is what you are so good at, dear. You also report a lot of answers. I personally don't care one way or another, but I want the rest of the people on here know what you are really made of. The only person I have a problem with is you. BTW, your little generalization and stereotypes can not hurt me, because I know who I am. My life is not a popularity contest; I practice peace of mind instead.|`|LsBS5bOCaa	I understand your frustration with men always having the pressure to come out of their pocket, make the effort, and be more chivalry's, although I think you're overgeneralizing. But, understand something. There are a lot of women out there who wear their heart on their sleeve and BEND OVER BACKWARDS for a dude, time and time and time and time again. And time and time and time and time again they get played ........badly. But you do have women who are willing to be equal to their man. She pays for the daycare - he pays the rent. She buys the food - he pays the car note, and the list goes on and on. Two reasons why you're probably feeling this way: Either you're surrounding yourself with needy, insecure, gold-digging women who want no other than to be on a life-time support contract. Or you're in the company of good, intelligent women, but unfortunately, you have to be the dude that gets it hard because the last dude was a total, womanizing and selfish creep. Next time, try to understand the kind of women you're around, and don't overgeneralize.|`|VDTTzwlUaa	Your reasons are generalized and assume that most women are this way. You should really be careful about making blanket statements such as "women are more selfish."    Men can be as selfish as women and vice versa. I agree with you that some women are socialized to expect everything and if they do not get it they get upset. Sadly, I feel like I see this behavior quite often in some women. It seems like, in the US at least, society tries to turn them into vain materialists, something that is very saddening to me.    I also feel that the culture still has some of those chivalric ideals embedded in it and there are cases where if you don't pay for the meal or the movie or something you ARE looked at as a bad guy. Also, I really hate it when women act like you owe them something. For instance, I was eating with a couple the other day and the woman got upset that the guy wouldn't put her coat on for her? Seriously, is she helpless?  If you don't open car doors for women you are vilified. Are they incapable of pulling the door?    Also, society basically makes it obligatory that you, as the guy, give your girlfriend and absurdly expensive rock for the engagement ring (used to be 3 months salary if I am not mistaken; probably more around 1 now). All it is is a symbol but if you don't shell out for it you are basically a "cheapskate" or a "scumbag." Women don't have any pressure on them to give a man jack-squat.

vvgmyX04aa	It may help quite a bit to reduce global poverty because statistically the majority of people who are poor are women and children. Life is Much better when we are free to decide when or if we want to have children.    It will certainly help improve access to birth control for women in some places but the truth is that the global gag rule and the US gag rule were both more political than anything else and were done to appease the religious right in the US. All it does is frustrate people as an idiot attempt at coercion by the US government.    For real, women and girls are aware of abortion as an option Anywhere that it is legal and sometimes where it isn't legal.    Re foreign aid, you should know that the amount of international aid from the US to third world countries is relatively small and is often given in self-interest, like to fight terrorism or narcotics.     The aid is often counterproductive, like food which is then sold by corrupt governments in the market in at lower then farmers can afford to sell. And many countries are refusing to accept US food aid because it is genetically modified and they are afraid.    And frankly, much more wealth leaves third world countries as flight capital then goes in as aid.    What will really help third world countries is for the first world (especially the US) to stop hurting them with subsidised agriculture policy and "free trade" policies that are not.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	It could certainly be a factor in the reduction of global poverty, but a LOT more would have to be done in order to make foreign aid funding less necessary.|`|rD5HyZyeaa	This is great news imo. More access to services/information equals more educated decisions made in terms of safe sex, family planning, etc. I would not say that it's a solution to global poverty, as it will take a lot more than lifting a gag order to bring third world countries up to speed in terms of reducing population, but it will sure help. Yay Obama.

HimBbU6caa	I think that in the West pop culture/media is without question more influential. There isn't even a debate about this in my opinion. Religion, particularly Christianity will always have some influence, but pop culture is now the new "faith". Models are now angels and media execs are for all intents and purposes gods themselves. We must bow down and worship the "American Idol". Jessica Simpson has been cast out of heaven because she has committed the unforgivable sin; She gained a few happy pounds because she is in love with a good guy. If you are a woman and you don't look like Adrianna Lima you are doomed to burn in fire and brimstone for all eternity. I think this form of secularism has the potential to be just as dangerous and as religion.|`|rD5HyZyeaa	I read what other people wrote about our culture having a matriarchal or patriarchal media. I'm not sure, but it appears that it is still mostly ruled by men:  http://www.natvan.com/who-rules-america/  That being said, I would agree that women are harsh, if not harsher, critics of themselves than men are. Anyone who is a frequent flyer of theskinnnywebsite.com and reads the comments (most from women) will see just how critical some women can be of one another - pictures of clearly emaciated celebrities with comments like "she's beautiful!" or "she's not thin, we're just used to seeing fat people." I do not believe women are inherently ruthless critics, however. We are taught that looks matter, and in fact are our greatest asset - as Jenn put in a previous response, our "only bargaining chip" in this culture. If you are a woman and you are beautiful, you matter. If you are not beautiful, you do not matter. I can give many examples from my life of where people have directly and indirectly told me this. Just to give a brief example - I wrote a paper for a class about how overweight female characters tend to be villains, and slender female characters are more likely to be the heroine. At the end I wrote a short paragraph about how women should be careful not to judge one another according to appearances, and that overweight women are equal to slender women. I let my boyfriend at the time proofread it, and he told me to make sure and include at the end that I personally wasn't fat. You know, so that my opinion in that last paragraph would actually mean something.    Back to your question, I think that the media has more influence these days than religion in terms of how we view women, primarily because religion is much less of a force in people's lives than things like television, movies, random advertisements, etc. It just seems that the media is run more by men than women. But both men and women contribute to the perpetuation of the unrealistic beauty standards. It really sucks being a woman and having to live with it everyday.|`|62ZBofvPaa	Wait...how is media/pop culture "matriarchal"?  Even if you say it "markets to women" (males 18-24 are the coveted demographic for ads last I checked)...that doesn't mean the same thing as matriarchal.  More women go to church then men too.    Anyway--I'm going to go ahead and say religion is always be more influential worldwide.  If it was pop culture/the media, gay marriage would have been legalized a long time ago.|`|q688OUsqaa	I think the media is more relevant than religion depending where you live. If you live in the US and in certain parts of the country media does dominate. However, in other parts of the US religion is still what people use to "dictate" their life. Think of it this way media always attract the younger generation. Also, wouldn't media be patriarchal? It's men (mostly) making the decision of what women wear, how they look, I just don't associate matriarchal and media together even if it's women who buy the products.|`|AXNowGPyaa	I think your question shows you are light years ahead of most other people in terms of understanding social dynamics. However, I would say that our media is certainly not "matriarchal." Our media is corporate. It exists for no other reason than to help corporations sell stupid, useless ****. They so thoroughly deregulated the media that the entire concept of "public airwaves" is as foreign to most Americans as "the eye of the needle" metaphor is to most rich American christians.     Our media is nothing more than advertising. That's it. They will put some content that might be vaguely entertaining or illuminating, but it is nothing really matters but selling bullshit.     I agree that women do make most of the spending decisions. I suspect it has usually been like that in most cultures. Women are the ones who are "security" motivated. I can't even count the number of guys I have known who turn their checks over to their wives and let them figure out the bills, dole out an allowence for beer or weed. I deliberately never chose a woman for myself who could be influenced by the media. We don't even have ******* television in my home. But my wife definitely has a better idea of what we need to be spending money on. Often she will bring up an something we need, that I never would have thought of, that I can see the obvious need for. I would live in a sleeping bag and hootch in the mountains and be happy, except I would keep thinking "damn, I need a woman." Well, the price of having a woman is that you have to maintain some standard of living.     I agree that most men are subconsciously afraid of the female body, but I have heard this line trotted out to explain why men aren't turned on by fat chicks, so without spending the time on your article, I can't comment. I have my own theories on this matter, and I tend to think I am way ahead of the academic hacks. Men are subconsciously afraid of the female body because it is the fountain of life, and also the breath-taking, shimmering promise of transcendence. This gets expressed in various ways by various men. Patriarchal religions are one of the most profound examples of this. Men have killed a lot of women over the course of human history just to prove than they aren't ruled by pussy. But in truth, we all are. Even most gay guys I've known are.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	If you think Christianity teaches that women's bodies are shameful, you are incredibly naive.  Tempting...yes, depending on the context, but not shameful.  At least, most Christians don't believe a woman's body is shameful.  The way she uses it can be shameful and tempting.  I can't speak for Islam.    I do think women pay more attention to the media than they do anything else when it comes to what they think is beautiful.  I don't know why women pay so much attention to the media on this.  Men don't, or at least few men do.  We know what we like and that's it.|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	Where do you get that the media is "matriarchal?" Just because the target audience is women, that does not mean that women are in power over the media, as "matriarchal media" would suggest. The vast majority of TV writers and advertisers, and all of those in power over the media. are still men.     A lot of daytime TV targets kids, does that mean that kids run the show when it comes to the media, as well?    Also, I wouldn't say that patriarchal religion was only "marketed" to men. Quite the opposite, in fact. Having read a lot of history of Western Religions, I can tell you that women were sold a bill of goods, too, and were often the first in a family to convert to Christianity. Western religions were simply reflections of the culture that was already in place, and a means to maintain the status quot.    And no "link" is required as proof that the all of the three major religions in the West, (that are all linked, of course, and sprang from the same culture), view the female body as sinful and tempting. No proof is needed for common knowledge. Judaism, well, it's there some, but Christianity (with their Deification of virginity) and Islam have it in spades. Of course, it is, again, as always, more a reflection of the cultures from which these religions developed.|`|6H1ie8WXaa	I agree with some of your points, anyone that thinks men are somehow brainwashing women to become anorexic or get fake boobs are completely clueless.    Here's the link to the question you referred to:    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|sfn6SpbCaa	We choose how we view our bodies; no one else can, nor should we allow them to. No one can tell another what they see with their own eyes.  We don't have to listen to everything.|`|VDTTzwlUaa	Islam and Christianity teach people that women's bodies are shameful and tempting? That may be true but you should present some documentation if you are going to make a claim like that.    Matriarchal dominated media/popular culture being the "religion" of society? I have no idea what you are talking about.    To say women are the main consumers in society is something I would have to see some reliable evidence for. I would need to see the same for the 80% of the money decisions statement as well.    I believe that part of the reason women focus on the outward appearance so much is because they are socialized to act that way. It seems like culture (here in the the US) seems to try and socialize women to be materialistic and vain (why is shopping one of the biggest "hobbies" for women I have never understood; I understand for many women it is a way to express themselves and give them a self-esteem boost but the ones that go all the time bother me. If you have clothing to wear, why do you constantly need to buy more of it?)

0YQRbq9faa	Older family members will always see you as a child because they remember your birth and growing up years. That is a going to be hard to shake off.    Change the tables on them.  Bring up events that were silly and embarssing to them.  If that is not possible, just spend minimal amounts of time with them.  They obviously upset you and make you feel demeaned and distressed.    Be polite, send birthday and holiday cards, call monthly and minimize the visits.|`|AA11239733	Yeah, I got a big one for you.  Your too worried about what they are saying about you.   You probably got married because you want to come across as older and more deserving of respect. Don't let their opinions dictate what you do with your life. The only effect you should let it have is fuel your desire for success in life. Plan to laugh at their insults with your vast desire for life and all that you have access to.  You will probably never get through to them but you can use it to your advantage. Let those flames rage from those insults, that's your advantage in success.|`|KPNOQAP4aa	hey, the best thing you can do is be confident in yourself. the more you seem unsure of your descisions, the bigger easier target you make when you're around your extended family.  also, remember the Golden Rule: if you want to be respected, show others that same respect and eventually they will do the same to you!  be patient as it doesn't work right away, but continue to show love to your family!|`|AA11216736	have you tried talking to your family. have a conversation with them in a serious mood tell them how you feel. get angry at them let them know how you feel express your feelings. if not let them tease you and tease them back. make fun of them like they make fun at you. its like playing around with each other. if not rarely go to family events and when they ask why you haven't been goin tell them that you want them to show you respect. maybe they make you mad on purpose like brothers and sisters. it happens in my family but thats just the way it is and its hilarious. know that they are just kidding dont take them seriously. I f they are not then talk to them.|`|VXaKIFVLaa	honestly ignore what they say and dont let them get to you if you think you have a good idea to open a business then go for it if you always let them put you down you will never succeed do what you think is best and then you can rub it in thier faces that your ideas are worth something and they work maybe then they will give you the respect that you deserve. and i dont think its a bad thing to be married at 19 that just means your ahead of the game at finding true love.. but dont let your family get to you because all you need is the love and support of your husband!!
ed2Zmw2aaa	u been watching real Housewives of Orange county, by any chance|`|UspK4SQBaa	"Prey on"?  I wasn't aware that married men were a popular snack.  If you're talking about stalking, my guess is ego coupled with mental illness.  Anything else is a consensual relationship, and the responsibility of the person cheating on his spouse.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	I've got a sister like that; this one time she was messing around with this married man. When I told her the guy was spoken for, as in married; all she said was. "That doesn't matter." So, I know their out there.

EeThBc3Zaa	My first boyfriend back in grade 9 tried to get me to let him call the shots by saying, "but happy couples don't fight!"  What a load of nonsense.    If you have an honest disagreement about something, it's good to talk about it.  The discussion may indeed be an argument.  An argument doesn't have to be mean; there are ways to argue respectfully.  I think one thing, he thinks another thing, and neither of us is inclined to automatically defer.  That's ok. If one person always lets the other have their way to avoid ever having an argument, they're likely to end up resenting it eventually.  I hate conflict, but sometimes something needs to be hashed out.  Name-calling, yelling, hyperbole, storming out, etc... are hopefully not a part of it.|`|Y9kHh7Ryaa	no  big blowout sale yes  yes      idk|`|9b6acf55d27a39548c86f16f9efbd431aa	In my experience it is better for my gf and I to confront each other on any thing, habit, or action that is bothering either partner.

You may be depressed, which can bring a "deadening" feeling to your emotions.|`|ewybA08Iaa	Hey.  Just be who you are.  No one but a mental health professional has the right to determine your degree of emotional responses.  I am emotional, I work in an ER.  When victims of a serious auto accident arrive, and are really injured, it's tough to no feel emotional.  I am not ashamed of crying but it doesn't interfere with my nursing intervention to triage them and work them up.  I cry when a patient presents with a serious cardiac event, are accompanied by their partner, and dies in spite of all our efforts.  I cry with the survivor(s).  The docs cry too. Life is precious, and I try to prolong it.  Sometimes I fail.  Sometimes we all fail.  So, just be who you are. To heck with other folks.|`|TRZNCxGzaa	if youre not an emotional woman, you convert to being a radical feminist right away.     umm.......they say the man-hating will come naturally|`|iHKJsyfTaa	" I've had enough! hrrrmmph"    If you weren't so emotional , you wouldn't be so worked up now , would you ?|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Nothing happens to you.

qCDFSLNOaa	I completely understand how you feel.  To be honest, a lot of people go through that in middle and high school.  I used to try so hard to make it look like I was living the perfect life and it was almost like trying to check off everything on a list (boyfriend, hot body, beautiful, popular, exciting...)  But in reality I felt bored, bored, bored and so trapped.    What you need to do, ideally, is find out what you REALLY want to be like and what you feel passionate about.  Also, try to avoid stagnation: explore and experiment and just try to enjoy life.  It's sounds corny, but just be yourself.      No one cares about the "hot girl" because they're all too busy trying to be perfect, too - if anything you're just that b*tch who is making competition.  By the way, don't forget that no one in middle school loves their life, no matter how perfect from afar it may seem, and it's just human nature to never be satisfied.    It's really hard to do that when you're in middle and high school because it's a different world there.  But trust me, once you graduate everything you've ever known will change.     Good luck :)|`|AA11216736	your a teen everyone goes through the emotions you just stated you are bored but wait high school is coming and life will get entertaining with the changes. you will got to parties but then wait you will get bored of going to parties. then when you grow up you will learn how to deal with boredom. if you want to get rid of boredom then go sky diving or do something new or maybe something or someone is holding you back. change your life either way your boredom wont last long. Nothing lasts forever. you worry about your looks because you want to be noticed and be the hot girl you answered your question.|`|Kl4kv5khaa	And yet in the eyes of someone else you have their idea of what they want for their life. How about you be happy with what you have and find a way to add the things you are missing to it.|`|TxETd4B1aa	As far as your looks. You're never going to be satisfied. There's nothing wrong with having these feelings, just don't let them take your time away from more important things in life. When I was your age, I was always looking for an edge with my looks. Trying different hair colors, different eye colors, different hair styles.Looking back it was a waste of time.    As far as what to do with your life, I would learn martial arts, or do another very challenging activity such as rock climbing, skiing, or even hockey.
z1YM1Xniaa	I have had one my entire life since I was a baby. I am half native american, so I grew up with the culture and I do believe it works. I have never had a problem with nightmares.

I understand that Dream Catchers are an American Indian Spiritual Belief, so I am not meaning to insult the Animist Religion thereof BUT ... i mean, honestly ... what would make you even debate it as a rational concept? Since when was the subconscious made manifest materially?    How can subconscious thoughts and/or "negative energies or spirits" that take place in the mind OR in the "spiritual realm" be entangled into a tangible physical net and thusly deterred?    The concept is as ridiculous as it is irrational. It's all BS and primitive superstition.    Nets are for catching fish, not dreams.    xoxo  ?|`|I1SP0tBMaa	i have always had one in my bedroom, but i also only buy the ones made by real indians, i think that is a big thing, i think they work|`|LKY38BNsaa	Well I have a dream catcher, I have never had a bad dream since I had it. But it is most likely that you have to think it is going to work before it will. Like saying to yourself before you sleep "I have a dream catcher, I'm not going to have a nightmare."|`|L7rap9cHaa	Depends on what you believe in.  Long down my ancestry line there is Native American blood, which caused my mom to fall in love with the culture and such, so I grew up believing in them.    Coincident or not, after my future-mother-in-law gave me one for Christmas and I hung it above my bed, I haven't had any terrible nightmares. Weird dreams, yes, but no nightmares. =)
kjW1fmmPaa	You could just be a natural introvert.  Some people are just naturally shy and uncomfortable in social situations.  But if it really is causing you distress, you could have social phobia.  I wouldn't say you have anxiety disorder, as with that people tend to worry excessively and sometimes have panic attacks.      As for getting over it, the best you can do is try to put yourself out there, face your discomfort and begin to learn that nothing bad is going to happen to you when you are uncomfortable.  Try not to put yourself in situations where you don't know anyone.  If going to a party or working in a group, try to get a friend to join you to help you out.  If you feel out of place in a group and feel they are judging you, you can apologize to them for being a little out of it, or say that you are not used to big groups.  You will probably find other people in the group agree with you, lots of us are introverts.      Other than that, you can consider talking to a therapist or social worker, they can help you work through these feelings and perhaps give you more detailed strategies to overcome them.|`|Kl4kv5khaa	Then talk. Try out dumb stuff to talk about then. Just anything. Good luck.|`|AA11239733	You just have something to hide. Are you a bisexual.

QAtpLEEFaa	Anomie; the loss of social rules, values, norms,  sometimes amounting to the dissoluton of a culture almost completely, can be so devasting to our sense of self and belonging that it becomes unbearable and we try to escape it   maybe by drugs, alcohol or even suicide.      This is the theoretical position and argument from the point of view of functionalism.    As we live in a society whose economy is based on having to create a continuing  'need to need', there is constant cultural pressure to discard material goods and thus also cultural values to ensure that we keep buying the 'latest' car, computer, fashion in clothes, holidays, forms of entertainment  In such a society we privilege not just the 'new' but the 'newer than new'.    In addition the cultural values of liberal individualism that we initally inherited from the Enlightment have created a much greater sense of freedom and social justice for an increasingly wide range of social groups, the 'common man', slaves,  people bound by predjudice surrounding gender,sexaultiy, ethnicity, childhood.      This has led not only to changes in social structures  like the family, religion, friendship groups, education,   but a continuing pressure to keep examining, pressing for changes, in once what were once taken for granted ways of 'being' and 'behaving'.    So from the Durkheimian or functional point of view we are especially at risk of being open to the risk of experiencing anomie.    Alternatively we could take Anthony Giddens view  that we now live in  'a reflexive society' that has increased levels of democracy and self consciousness and that in spite of the risks this is generally a much better way to live.     On the other hand we could be far more suspicious and take the Conflict perspective to ask     'in whose interests has this form of consumerist culture developed and who benefits from this mode of living?'     In which case we  would tend to replace the term 'anomie' with the concept of 'alienation'.

cJRFbZUaaa	If you mean a psychiatric hospital, you can look them up in your local directory.  Every city has at least one; these days they are usually affiliated with a general hospital or medical school.      If you're interested in a career in mental health, contact the hospital and ask if they can show you around.  Many of them also  have volunteer programs where you can help the patients with their recreational or other activities under staff supervision; then you really get to see the mental health system.|`|BsRZsOJVaa	If you know someone in there, or are thinking of signing yourself in, they would probably show you around, but as far as i know, they stopped giving tours in asylums in the 18th century.|`|AA11239733	Best way you can get there is do something dumb, I mean real dumb and when you go on trial get your lawyer to enter the plea of mentally disabled.

It's much more enjoyable to talk on the phone or watch TV  than scrub the floors or clean the closets, but those things have to be done.  It just takes self-discipline, and some folks have more of that than others.

bb24aa09ca7e3f59fb7e5b06be37c61daa	Kelsier, from Brandon Sanderson's "Mistborn Trilogy".     A proper leader should know the strengths and weaknesses of all he/she commands, to the point that he/she can win an argument against any one of them in any subject. He/she should be able to recognize talent when he/she sees it, regardless of whether the person being scrutinized is a foe or a potential ally.    A leader, however, should not be arrogant to assume that he/she is the best, even if he/she is. Humility goes a long way, as does self-sacrifice and the wisdom to know when you have lost, and when you should cut those said losses and salvage the situation as best as possible.     The most important part of a leader is motive. If the leader is not motivated enough, he/she could cause the destruction of all around him/her. Similarly, if he/she is too motivated, he/she could run into a potentially disastrous situation, again, causing the destruction of all around him/her.    Kelsier, while a flawed character, with motives that border on revenge, which could have caused the death of his comrades, held himself back, and knew when to retreat, and when to sacrifice himself so his teammates could stand a chance to escape and, as hackneyed as it sounds, live to fight another day.
ToILKl6waa	Personally, this site helps me more. Seeking advice from a therapist, along with the expenses, is less rational when it comes to life issues. People of all different ages who have crossed so many different paths can offer more alternatives for me on here - rather than from one person at therapy.|`|DqmMW2tcaa	Yes defiently, there are some people who try really hard to give good advice and have experienced the same issues as you so they know first hand what you are talking about.

Then there is some that you just have to take with a grain of salt.|`|AA10510845	I'm sure a lot of it is well meant, but a professional is trained; whereas we common folk are not.  The people on here who have experienced some of the same situations that are being asked about, can give advice based on their own methods of dealing with their problems.  But if you need  therapy or a diagnosis, it's best to see a pro.|`|cLSaq5qaaa	NO NO NO NO therapist give TERIBLE advice some don't even come to you appointments they DO NOT help whats so ever please DO NOT wast 500 $$$ on a STUPID therapist  please believe me they SUCK do not go please they do NOT help they STINK trust me do NOT go wasting money like that they are so BAD please beleaive me you might as well talk with family. do NOT go please they STINK and are very STREESFULL do NOT go the do NOT help at all please trust me i HATE them please do NOT go i HATE them so BAD they stink.          sorry i got a bet carried away|`|TxETd4B1aa	It depends on what you're asking. People on here tend to be more blunt, which is good, bc people need to know the truth. But sometimes the advice they give is simply wrong.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	Both are good ways to get help, depending on the situation. A therapist is needed when things very personal should not be given to a lay person for advice. It could back fire and make things even worse than they are for the person in need. Yes, this is also a good site to help others through our own experiences when things are lite and not to heavy like people that are suicidal. We have to be very cautious in what is said but the choice always comes back to the individual themselves. I believe we should only respond to those questions we are personally qualified to answer. That is my personal reason for being on this site, to share my experiences, hope and compassion for my fellow human beings regardless of the attitudes we find here.|`|F3lyP5XLaa	yes my friend you see we do this because we like it and a lot of people have very good things to say and you don't have to pay|`|Wy7oZGvZaa	probably for the price but there are a bunch of idiots on here|`|el8yX5q3aa	I am a drug and alcohol therapist and I try to give some really good advice.  I also joke around sometimes....but mostly I do try to help.    I have seen a lot of people here very helpful and trying........and a lot of them that are rude and vulgar...and some just making points.

But they aren't so much needed these days in america as far as i know
XvO4iLk0aa	G Turn poison to medicine bying the LDK.  Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.|`|AA10510845	Don't always listen to rumors.  Just because some people have had negative experiences, doesn't mean that you will.  The real purpose of college is to advance your education.  If you concentrate mainly on that, you won't have time to think about the dorms or the food.  As far as the safety factor, it's probably no better or worse than any other college.  Don't go anywhere alone at night, if you're worried, which is a good idea in any situation.  You will make friends and have a social life.  Just be sure you choose the right friendships.  In spite of what you may have heard about the school, it could turn out to be the best time of your life.  Think positive.  You've heard the expression, one man's meat is another man's poison.  What that means is that everyone has his or her own opinions of things.  I had a great time in college even though I slept on the top bunk in a crowded dorm room, and ate at a greasy-spoon on-campus cafe.  I survived and had fun.  I predict you'll be just fine.  Good luck!|`|AA11216736	Deal with the situation either dont go there at all and wait for a better opportunity or (fight for one) or try to make the dorm as best as you can so it can be comfortable, eat somewhere else, try to be as safe as possible, and make new friends. Find solutions to your problems be creative about it. I know you can do this you are a very strong person who can get through whatever life throws at you with a lil bit of help from the people who love you. Give it a shot and if it really is bad that it interferes with your education go to another school.  ps who knows maybe it isnt at all that bad as everyone makes it out to be maybe it just rumors|`|iHFZLsDTaa	So many many young adults are so spoiled by their parents that they are not happy once they get away from home the first year.  They are not use to the "outside" world.      Yes, you will be homesick at first, but that will change in a couple of months.      Think of it as a time to grow up.  You are no longer a child or teenager.  You are now a woman on your own.    The second year will not bother you at all.  In fact, you will be glad to get back to school.    1. Make sure your are not out after dark.  2. Make your room as pretty as you can.  3. If the other girls are not nice to be around or if they are too loud, ask your parents if you can move to a near by apartment.  4. Always remember that you are not there to have fun, you are there to learn so that you can find a good job after you graduate.  This is VERY important.  I've been there, done that, and got a great paying job later on.  5. Before going, learn to cook.  Have your mother walk you around a grocery store and show you how to shop for food items.  Here are some hints for you:    Do you have a microwave?  If not, do your best to buy one during December...they are on sell for about $60.00 at places such as Walmart, Target, and etc.  Do not buy a low wattage such as 700.  But one over 1000w.  Mine is 1100w.    There are only two of us at home and we found out that the now frozen dinners are delicious and most are healthy with no preservatives.  Buy the top known brands.  We like the ones in the "red" boxes.    Here is a typical weekly dinner for us:  We both have our own frozen dinner;  Canned pears or other fruits;  Small can of vegetables;  Can of sweet potatoes or bake two potatoes in the microwave;  Ready made frozen pie, or a dessert from the deli, or ice cream cups.  Give it a try for one week and see what you think.    Another thing you can do is buy pre-cooked meats such as pot roast, chicken, pork chops, ham, meatloaf, etc. Divide them into meals and freeze them. We do this often.  Ask a grocery store clerk to help you find these pre-cooked meats. They are in the refridgeration section.    The boxed pasta dinners are delicious.  Just follow the directions on the boxes.  You will find these on the shelf at your grocery store.  Each box has a packet of spices.      You can buy cups of rice for one person.  Just add water.  Follow directions on the containers.    Canned soups with a sandwich make great dinners or lunches.    Bagged salad greens will often give you two or three salads.  BE SURE TO READ THE DATES.  Buy the ones that have been washed twice. Salad greens go bad fast.    Cerals are good for supper.    Eggs are also good for supper as in fried egg sandwiches.    Grilled cheeses with soup.    Spam can be fried or eaten cold on bread.    Canned fish such as kippers, sardines, tuna, salmon (I like to put a little soy sauce or salsa on kippers and sardines).    Not to worry, you will be fine.
48Wd4b6iaa	If I like a look of a girl in a magazine, I might want to look/dress/act that way myself but that doesn't necessarily make me want to get to know who she is outside of that. Maybe your quietness is seen as standoffishness and they think that you don't want to open up to them. Not everyone is driven to know how someone or something works; just how it looks.|`|byMIc9Qoaa	Hey girl,  these girls are just jelous! they LOVE your look so much they copy it, but they are intimidated by you b/c YOU are the one that has a sense of style..so they do the weak thing and just copy you instead of befriending you. They don't become friends with you b/c you would always "steal the scene" everyone would notice you not them....  so it is better to be on your own and ROCK then to have a bunch of ******* around that have no self confidence!    You go girl!!|`|rroE37HTaa	lol..back in the day I decided to wear a safety pin halter and an orange and purple mini skirt with ripped hose and  stiletto heels, just to see who would show up at the club in orange and purple and ripped hose!

Everyone "knew who I was"..but very few knew the real me!   lonely a bit at the time- put yourself out there to those who copy you, compliment them, you'll find a following!|`|vJGD33joaa	No one is copying you.  You didn't start any trends.  You copied someone else, who copied someone else.  Did you get to know the person you copied?  You're probably a teenager.  Every teenager thinks they are "original".  Don't give yourself too much credit.|`|4a59df84df1288d7f15ad9e558548236aa	Well, times are tough and some young children are just getting dumber by the second. So they just suck the knowledge (or taken advantage) of you like a bunch of leeches.

I believe you know what to do.|`|lQIKWXDuaa	Ok take as a compliment and live as that. Trust me you dont need friends like that. They will come to your house see what you have and go buy it.

4KocdJt4aa	This really isn't something you can have a right answer to. The world is evolving so incredibly fast, it's really hard to call exactly whats going to happen. If you look at it now, the stuff we're learning in school probobly will be obsolete in 10 years anyway, and I'm sure the schools will cater to all the changes, there will be a lot more narrow career options, and It might be a lot harder to change your jobs.      To tell you the truth, it dosen't matter anyway because we won't be effected. The robots will have inslaved us by then.|`|AA11922229	The question is like pounding a crooked nail into wood expecting the nail to go straight. Education is not a factor or denominator of specialization. The world does not adjust. Individuals adjust, and the overwhelming factor of change with the individual is economics, not education. Education can be a stepping stone, and may be significant, but so many other factors are involved, it makes this question bogus. Try asking again. What is this question in context of?  Technology? The limits of the individual?    Have you heard of the "Jack of all Trades?", it's based entirely on the acumen of the the individual. Some have it and many don't. One can stuff their brains academically and they can't swing a hammer if their life depended on it. I know people who can't remember which way to turn a bolt, but they can predict the weather accurately for the next week.    This is a mystery until you find your own gift. You are missing the point and the question. It's all about discovering your own gift to the world and then allowing that to be in service of mankind. What is your gift? Everyone has a gift. No one is smarter or better.     The baker bakes bread, the teacher teaches, and they may not be able to switch jobs easily, but then they might do very well at both.    On the question of diversification, this is again an individual choice. This depends entirely on how one takes on the world.   Are you one to stick to one thing and repeat that for a lifetime, like a clerk in a store, or are you open to learning and growing and moving on to other things. Is your will pushing in a direction.    This has nothing whatsoever to do with selecting a curriculum at school. It's about going out in the morning with grandma to the garden, because you always learn something from her, or spending every waking hour on playstation and the ipod until one day she dies and you wished you spent more time with her and you don't even know what you missed.     Ignorance is bliss. Jesus said, "Forgive them father for they know not what they do."   We are like that. We don't know what we are doing. All of this Star Trek technology and high tech specialization, no time to learn about real life, spoiling our time in artificial worlds. What does it count for?|`|bWjlXxB3aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEdoLKknC...

It's called standards and not everyone has the same standards.|`|UIpxfpIOaa	human nature|`|16F7DelAaa	Because most people are unsatisfied with their own lives, but instead of taking some time for self reflection, and fixing their faults, they would rather point out other peoples.

AA10510845	It's the "forbidden fruit" syndrome.  And in some ways, you feel safer having these unlikely crushes as a form of self-protection.  That way you don't have to make any real commitments.  Sometimes, however, this can backfire, and you could find yourself in hot water.  So as long as you just lust from a distance, and don't do anything about it, you'll be okay.  Meanwhile, why not date the ones who are available?  Who knows?  You might get some real interaction that you'll find a lot more satisfying.  Good luck!|`|dOjKgZ2naa	2-4-6-8 you cant get a date|`|jDGvcxTBaa	Ouch, I know how you feel :[   I'm the same way!!

You make the choice as to who you want to see or are attracted to. Now you can make a different choice if you want to one day settle down with a wife and have children. There are lots of books on this subject as well you could talk to a therapist.  Good luck.
Vg57Gr2Waa	The quality of life for working class people in Europe has eroded as our governments have stepped closer to the American model  but for now they haven't deteriorated to American levels.     Britain has perhaps the most Americanized society, with countries like France, Germany, Holland and the Scandinavian countries clinging closer to the European enlightenment model.    In Britain the healthcare service was first underfunded by the Thatcher and Major governments in an attempt to create public dissatisfaction and pave the way for privatization. This strategy failed, so under Blair and Brown we have seen back door privatization. Some hospital facilities are now earmarked for employees of certain companies, such as RBS, with limited access for the general population.    The same story can be seen across the spectrum of social-economic policy. It's clear that the American model is being pushed onto countries around the world, not because it is successful, but because mass unemployment and minimal benefits are good for business and elite interests.    The American economic-social model is repugnant to most Europeans, even on the right of the political spectrum. I don't know any ordinary Europeans who envy the American system. We're amazed that so many Americans seem to support it. The fight against the American social-economic model is now coming to the boil in Europe, thanks to this economic crisis. It's no coincidence that where unions have been strongest, and ordinary people most active, ordinary people have stronger protection and enjoy more benefits. You have to be willing to fight for your neighbors, fight for your self, and fight for your children's future. Americans should demand better, but the European model is in danger of vanishing.

If you think about it though, 16 to 20 is a HUGE change mentally, physically and emotionally but its only 4 yrs, and it seems to us to take ages. Then in the 20-24 you dont change quite as much- but we keep expecting life to go as slowly as it did from the 16-20 age gap, but it dosent cause we have less growing up to do and we are not trying things for the 1st time etc. I think it just all speeds up from there, but if it seemed like you had ages of time left at 16, and then at 20 it probably seemed like a lot of time had passed, consider that you still have that same amount of time left, 4 yrs, before you even hit 30 and make the most of it!|`|7xmr5R6qaa	If you're not wrinkled then you're not old.|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	You are, obviously, really old.

Tell that to my 84 year old granny!!! :P
ZLEeVhEPaa	It's a pretty simple argument that it creates jobs.    Let's say inflation is going to be 5%, and you know it.    You've got 10K sitting around, and you know that if you don't do anything with it, it'll be worth just $9,500 by the end of the year.    This puts some pressure on you to get rid of your cash now, buying things before you lose your purchasing power.    So as a consumer, you buy more.    Now, as a producer/investor, you know that any inputs you buy now are going to be cheaper than later inputs, right?  So you're already gearing up to buy more stuff.  And, of course, expecting higher prices later in the game, you're also going to get higher revenue later than you otherwise would.  It makes sense to buy relatively cheap inputs now (like capital and labor, keeping people employed), and sell relatively expensive outputs later.  Much more sense than keeping your money under your mattress and having it steadily fall in value.      The government, of course, doesn't directly control inflation, though there are government policies that have effects on inflation.    If the government were to decide just to print more money, and put it into circulation, that would cause inflation, yes, of course.  The US government doesn't do that, because one of their goals is to keep reasonable control of inflation so that the dollar can retain purchasing power.    Other governments, like in Zimbabwe, do over print constantly more money than the year before.  In Zimbabwe's case, printing more money is a way to pay back government debt.    Of course, the money they're paying people back is worth far less than the money they were loaned to start with, but, it's what they're doing, in any case, rather than cut spending or raise taxes.    This causes people to be less willing to loan to Zimbabwe's government, so they have to grant even more interest on the loans to make it attractive at all.  That means they have to print even more money, and the circle continues. Inflation in Zimbabwe, naturally, is the worst in the world.|`|6CglkxPnaa	if i understand your question correctly, your are confused.  Inflation is not a process dictated by the government, instead it is a Natural occurrence that results from a consumerist economy.  As demand increases, people are more willing to pay for goods, thus making the prices rise and buying power goes down.|`|kwYxQp0Maa	Though it is also true that if the government just prints more money or as it actually happens makes more available in the system, it does create inflationary pressure.  The Federal Reserve will issue Treasury notes and then add the money to the system. In effect they are borrowing money that already exists, but since much of the money if from overseas(China) it increases the money actively floating around in our economy.  But this is the only way the government can increase spending without increasing taxes to see an immediate cash influx.
XvO4iLk0aa	G Think of the lousiest job you can. Find some people who do it, and ask them their opinions about intellectual laziness.|`|iHFZLsDTaa	Read.  Or listen to books on CDs.  You can get both from your local library or buy them.|`|0YQRbq9faa	Read a book.  Read several books in something you are interested about.  Write a story about something that you are interested in - a hobby, a favorite time in history, a favorite thing to do.|`|TZ6eJeqoaa	Listen, you are not the only one. Follow these steps and they should help. Also do what Einstein did. Visualize the theory on your head.      "Active Reading Strategies    Almost all university courses require the integration of substantial quantities of textbook material with class notes; mastering the technique of reading rapidly yet effectively is one of the greatest challenges to students at all levels.    First of all, no single style of reading works equally well for everyone, and no single style of reading suits all material. Reading a textbook for detailed information is not like reading a novel for pleasure; the two tasks must be approached differently.    There are two steps to any program of effective text study, one tactical and the other strategic. On a tactical level, university students must increase their general reading speed; on a strategic level, they organize the way they approach a reading assignment. A general program to help develop effective reading strategies is outlined below:    I. Surveying the text;    II. Surveying the chapter;    III. Reading to answer questions;    IV. Marking the chapter and/or taking chapter notes;    V. Reviewing using recitation.        I Survey the Textbook    Purpose    To grasp major points quickly and to discover the overall organization of the text in a short period of time.    How Does Surveying a Textbook Help You Learn?    If you know what someone is trying to do, it is easier to follow what he or she says. If you know the central purpose of a book or chapter, it is easier to see how each section fits in. This is the kind of knowledge you get from the preface, the table of contents, the headings, and the summaries. This knowledge will give you some control over the book.    Surveying gives you increased understanding and retention by obtaining an overview of the whole before reading in detail. Surveying also improves concentration by stimulating your interest. Finally, by exploring all the parts of the book, you will be able to use the book's internal organizers, such as the table of contents, the glossary, or the index.    Method    Quickly sample key parts of the text and avoid details. Look for    clues about the content of the work, the organization of the text, and the author's point of view and style. Explore the book by asking yourself questions to stimulate interest.    1. Title: How does it differ from others on the same subject, or by the same author?    2. Author: Do his or her background and qualifications seem appropriate for the subject?    3. Copyright date: How current is the book?    4. Preface: Does the preface explain the book's          i) subject and range of coverage;          ii) special worth or importance;          iii) pedagogic or ideological purpose;          iv) principle of organization.     The preface usually explains the author's organizational pattern; understanding this will help you read more swiftly and surely. You can easily identify main points because you have "inside" information about the focus and goals of the book.    5. Table of Contents: How is the book organized? Do some chapters seem more important than others? Are there a few major parts? If not, can you simplify the organization into two or three categories? If the table of contents of a chapter has subheadings are they really identifying the main ideas in the chapter?    6. Chapter Organization: Are headings and subheadings used throughout the chapter? Are there summaries or questions at the end?    7. Random Pages and Illustrations: What is the author's style? Read the first sentence of a few paragraphs. Glance at illustrations.    8. Summaries and Conclusions: Is there a concluding chapter? If there is a section providing a summary or review, it will probably state the contents of the book most precisely. Read it after surveying.    9. Appendices, Glossaries, Index, Bibliography: Which of these are included? How helpful are they?    II Survey the Chapter    Purpose    To grasp major points and to discover the overall organization of the chapter quickly.    How Does Surveying a Chapter Help You Learn?    Exploring a chapter by spot-reading in this fashion does not give you all the information. However, it can give you the general outlines of main ideas, problems, and questions. By taking this "bird's-eye view" you will be able to see more clearly how the ideas fit together in the chapter. We remember details better when we understand how they relate to major concepts.    As a result of surveying a chapter, your mind fits the information into topics or categories which make sense to you. Consequently, when you do begin reading you are able to cluster ideas, facts, and details around these mentally-held categories that you have already established. These categories are called "advance organizers." Once you have an idea of the total picture, it is easier to assign the details to their proper place and learn them.

I had this dream last night that I had this huge aquarium.  In the water were beautiful fish and 2 octopusses (Octopi?) One of 'em kept trying to creep out of the lid and fell on the floor.  It is so weird to lift an octopus off the floor in your dream.  Your senses try to imagine what it feels like and probably over exagerrates it.
IgvDTm6naa	She might be amazing like you say, but for people to make effort with you, you have to make effort with them. And maybe if she spoke to a bit more people, people would start realizing how talented and how beautiful she is. :) She just needs a little push, to put herself out there even if its a little bit.|`|gWLhIoIiaa	"doesnt put herself out there"    i think that's the problem. teens dont go out of their way to befriend some wallflower.as long as she isnt bullied it may be a blessing in disguise. hs "friends" and acquaintances these days..don't trust em! too much mean girl clique stuff going on it may be better that shes not a part of all that!|`|ZaYyXiJAaa	That's the problem with high school.

Like you said, "she doesn't put herself out there." This is the problem. She needs to take small steps into "putting herself" more "out there." If she acts confident and happy (even if she is shy), people will want to be her friend.|`|3nrax9Hzaa	probaly she needs to communicate more or you no how pple are now-in-days there are alot of haterz out there or her skewl completley sucks

Yes, I repeated it twice because that's how many Americans were stupid enough to go onto and now they are out of money.
e2DEQ6Euaa	First, think of all the positive things in your life like you family, friends and achievements. Before you start saying you have none of those and your all alone, reread your question. You are trying to follow God's word. That alone is an achievement in itself.    Next, try not to get worked up that other people don't have the same views as you. Everyone is different, that is the way god made us all. It is okay to keep an open mind and spread God's word while listening to the views of others. Sometimes they convert to your way, sometimes you convert to theirs, sometimes you both part still solid in your own thoughts. Its all good.    As for sinning, we all sin from time to time, its what makes us human. If you feel bad about it, pray to God for strength, confess your sin to your priest and try a form of penance by doing a good deed. Do not beat yourself so hard over what is done. What is important is how you grow in the future.    If you ever need someone to talk to, remember that priests are always more than willing to provide a listening ear.    God bless and take care :)|`|mjDdy67Jaa	Become more self confident.  learn to defend your ideas..

Though it is a rare teacher, who combines teaching a particular subject with great passion and flair, combining that with an honest interest in his/her students, with respect and kindness...goes a long way with some students--helping them to learn and see things from different viewpoints.  I was lucky to have one in high school, and he was the only adult who took the time to treat me as a person-- it was obvious to his students that teaching was more than "just a job".|`|AA10510845	Absolutely!  My teachers were very influential in shaping my life, instilling ideals and helping me choose a career.

The former is having racial attitude, the latter is being a racist.|`|aOd0Djkaaa	i don't think that they are more accepting of the jokes I think that if a person says a racist joke then they are racist. If someone says I'm not a racist but this joke is funny. First the person felt the need to justified themself, to make themselves feel better for saying a joke that belittles someone. I think why nothing is said to these people that say jokes like that is what do you say to an idiot?

nulE8zdBaa	The question if dreams do come true is often asked on this Yahoo Site. What comes up just as frequently is confirmation that they really come true.     Most often such confirmations are exemplified with a dj vu experience. Dj vu is French for seen before. Some people know that they have seen such waking events in a dream, the night before. Others doubt this and believe that dj vu is a trick of the mind.     It is not. The dj vu experience is founded in a dream. It is usually about trivial things yet quite vexing, because often those who had the experience doubt their mind. I tell those dreamers not to doubt what happened. I assure them that dreams can foresee the future.  In fact they do nothing else but foretell the future. They are actually the blueprints of waking life. However not many dreamers can see that because they do not know the dream language sufficiently.    The first thing you need to know about our dreams is that they are mainly a picture language talking in metaphors. But they do not just hold up a picture of what is to happen, they have you actually involved, they let you experience the future. But this future is presented in metaphors, in illustrative experiences.     Thus you might dream that you were flying on a white cloud. The next day you will say: That was a weird dream! But it was not weird; it was actually a signal that you will feel very HIGH on the day after the dream. Indeed, if someone asked you how you felt on that day you might well say: Today I feel on Cloud Nine!    It is actually very interesting that we translate such metaphors with the greatest of ease in our everyday situations. If someone says for instance: I have fallen in love, we wont ask that person: Did you hurt yourself when you fell? We just naturally translate this fall into a fall from ordinary mundane emotions into a whirlwind of adrenaline driven feelings.    This is how you have to read most of your dreams. There are exceptions where you see the dream or parts of it come true literally.     Your realistic dream is no guarantee that it will come true as you have seen it, although it is a possibility. What you will have to do now is to start a dream diary and write down your dreams and then watch what is happening in the future. Keep in mind that they are mainly metaphors; also date them because they may take days, weeks, months and even years before they will come true. Good luck on your new venture!|`|hyo4tWv9aa	u have many dreams in one night , and u can only remeber the one dat u had most recent, so might be having more realistic dreams but yes it might tell he future as ur body is telling  u wat to do dats right for u|`|G5Wn8Y7Qaa	i think they can.  i had a dream that my aunt was at our house and she killed herself. and about a month later, she died. she had a heart attack, but they found an empty pill bottle next to her.  so i think they can. but not all of them.|`|OYgtlTEfaa	I have dreamed of numbers that I later bet on and they came in.

You mind creates dreams based on what you are confused on and wish deeply.      So you need to work on it, you can't just sleep on the couch all day and have the boy of your dreams ask you out next week.|`|GGpkMLwUaa	Yes. I first found out I could, well, envision things in my dreams was in 5th grade. I saw a boat dock with vocabulary , and I was thinking it was sort of weird. Three monthes later, I went to a week of camp and I saw it. It really scared me, but it scared me even more when they started showing up reguraly.  Only snippets of the future, things like candels, places, clocks, ect. Pretty soon they started showing up every other night. I was very angry and nobody believed me, so I started to stay up every night just so I wouldn't sleep. Now, these "visions" only come about once a month    A few pointers:    Just because a dream seems realistic dosnt mean.it will come true. Mainly I can barely remember having a dream until it comes true. Also, these things are not deja vu, they are just things that occur to a few humans. You cannot choose what you see, it just happens.    Don't think I'm crazy, this just happens. And I know some people can agree.|`|aOQZ2ZAOaa	i personally dont think thats what dreams do...  i think dreams are more of our thoughts that we've had recently  being sort of acted out...ifthat makes sense  haha|`|rQKwu4vBaa	There have been plenty of times I have had a dream and the realistic parts of them have become true. Some were sad and some were happy. Its is really weird but what can you do.|`|L7rap9cHaa	It's possible.  I believe some dreams can come true.  To most people, a dream is just your subconscious getting it's 15 minutes of fame, and it releases everything it knows into your dreams.    Though with some people, their dreams can predict the future. I know I've had some predictive dreams before...|`|TJmQrdTtaa	probuly like 2/3 of my dreams come true im just really scared of them   once i drame about my aunt that i hardly ever see come to my house and telling us that someone in her family had herpies ,turns out she came the next day and toold us someone in her family ha heppotitis something  i dram that msomething happened to my mom,everyone in my dream was sad and just saying her name,2 days later she fell hard(shes ok now)  ive had tons of these dreams these are just a few.

But in the long run, what does crying do, except release emotional anxiety -- which is good.  Try not to let flunking or not making the top grade get you that emotionally torn up.  And cut your parents a little slack.  They should appreciate honesty over keeping something from them.  I flunked algebra in high school and had to repeat it.  The next time I passed with flying colors.  A lot of "not getting it" goes to the fault of the teacher.  After having a career in law, I can tell you, you don't need great math skills.

jKIBBgsQaa	I think that a big part of the answer is that girls are starting to hit their stride so to speak in terms of getting an education and growing up believing they can be whatever they want to be.  The number of males obtaining degrees hasn't changed much as I understand it.  Instead, girls are simply doing a better and better job of striving for a higher education.  So I guess we have reached a sort of plateau for boys, but girls have not had the chance to reach theirs.  Lets see where it ends up, but if the current trend continues, its possible that the stay at home dad will be the norm out of necessity.|`|6H1ie8WXaa	Depends what you're comparing here though. Though the issue is a serious one, the media seem to leave out bits of information like the fact that men outnumber women in technology institutes, apprenticeships and in starting their own businesses.|`|BkleL3F4aa	We have a feminised education system that cateres to girls, it is a reverse of the old education system that catered to boys that girls didnt do so well in.    Mens rights groups, childrens rights groups and some scientists are on to it. It is not a victory as many feminists will depict it as.      "Research by Simon Baron-Cohen, a respected Cambridge professor, that began as an investigation into autism, puts a solid case for biological male/female differences in the brain, with boys tending to be systematisers and girls empathisers. This explains why boys generally are less keen on reading and comprehension, and lag behind girls in literacy. A lot of boys find it easier to explain the workings of a watch than to discuss how a character in a story is feeling. But now, says Palmer, apart from the very bright ones, boys aren't even doing better at maths and science.     Some people blame this nosedive, first noticed in the mid-Nineties, on the feminisation of education - too many women teachers, girl-friendly classroom environments and modular exam systems that suit girls' study skills but disadvantage risk-takers. Geniuses are much more likely to be male, Palmer says, but if you don't tick the right boxes, you fail.           "The current generation of teachers, though, were born and raised in an atmosphere dominated by women's liberation and non-gender-specific education that began in the Seventies. Barbies were banned, most protagonists in books were female and there was no tolerance of war or superhero play. As a head teacher, Palmer remembers making her reception teacher remove all the cloakroom pegs that depicted tractors for boys and bunnies for girls.     The belief was that you were shaped by your environment, and it was the teacher's responsibility to socialise' boys away from their natural inclinations and to encourage girls to study traditionally male subjects such as physics and technology, she says.     Palmer would never deny that some of it was absolutely necessary - but with movements such as Reclaim the Night, Greenham Common and Gay Pride, groups that offered an alternative perspective to the traditionally dominant male view taking centre stage, masculinity became suspect. I really think, she says, that the almighty ****-up of the sisterhood in the Seventies was that we believed we could turn boys into girls.     Palmer says that most women are not natural risk-takers, so for teachers who have not helped to bring up brothers and who don't have sons, boys' behaviour can be frightening. Play-fighting, for example, reaches a peak at age 7 or 8 but is not actually aggressive, she says. It's social - it's the way boys get to know each other and see how the other one ticks. A lot of women teachers are horrified when I suggest that they should let boys get on with fighting and shouting because eventually they'll come out the other side and start negotiating................................|`|BoqbYQ1Naa	Because they'd rather sit home, watch internet porn, and jerk off.|`|un0C52G8aa	That's because men still have opportunities to get high paying jobs that don't require a college degree such as construction worker, trucker, or fire fighter.

I don't know if it's that everyone is still thinking girls and women are oppressed and they need more help, if people think women need college education more than men these days, or if it's something else, but based on my own experiences, girls definitely seem to have college pushed on them more.    I can't really provide a source, as this is my own opinion more than anything.

I really can't say that they have the 'right' to kill themselves. They have an obligation to those around them to hang on.

So many teens commit suicide, before they have even had a chance to really live, and explore their full potential. I don't think that they should be in charge of taking their own lives if they aren't even in charge of legally taking a drink. Even adults shouldn't be allowed to do something like that, because they aren't fully stable and they are hurting people, even if they don't know it. I think you have enough answers detailing that, so I won't go into a full spiel. Basically, if their chemical levels are not at a happy medium, they shouldn't be in charge of such a big decision.|`|9dc5fd65038eb20b63730ea6c2735c14aa	I dont think it should be permitted. people can always get help and things can always be set right again, if they give themselves a chance to make it right. nothing is totally bad, u'll always find something worse. taking ones life is totally wasteful|`|KPNOQAP4aa	correction: suicide DOES harm other people besides the effector--it hurts the people connected with that person!

God has the copyright on our lives and all creator's rights, not us.|`|cf7e502388f77678bbc75e745e427e26aa	Let me play the devil's advocate {{again}}.  Does it harm people physically? Probably not. But they will be saddened that "you" are gone. But they will have each other to cling to better.   But people are allowed to hurt themselves (and others) with nicotine and caffeine and "Red  5"    ..."Leaving people behind." Well, people are allowed to walk out their back door and never look back.    People shouldn't waste their lives like that. They can, however, waste it in other ways, like drinking and drugs (legal and illegal).     If the people in this society don't live their lives inclusively, they will continue to automatically alienate others. Those 'others' perceptively notice this exclusion and respond the way any 'normal' lonely person would: they feel less important and more apt to end their lives. (or 'life')     People like that aren't 'mentally stable' therefore we should control them and turn them over to the Nazi State - oops, then again, *no one* is *really* "mentallly stable;" therefore no one should be given full access to their rights and lives - let the State decide who's dumb enough or pretty enough to deserve to live.     Though others here have made good points: It is a permanent solution to usually temporary problems. Unless you believe in reincarnation.    Oh... legalese: "It's not my fault."|`|qUgHnBqUaa	It does harm someone else in the process.  What about friends and family members.  And God himself!  It shows buy the number of suicides each year that clearly people are allowed to kill themselves.      I personally would never be able to do it.  Mainly because I believe in God and that suicide will lead me straight to hell.  Another reason I couldn't is because bad things pass.      A lot of people aren't educated on Suicide.  The people that commit it and the ones around that person. And I know that sounds crazy.  But for example my friend killed him self when we were all in middle school.  He wrote poems about death and he felt as if the world was falling down around him because he got picked on.  People read the poems often and just looked at the situation like he was a really good young writer.  Never once questioning him about his poetry.  The "popular" girls in school continued to tease and life at home working on a farm at 13 wasn't every kids dream.  So one day after his final poem he killed himself.  His family and true friends were devastated.  Why didn't anyone of us see the signs.  And if he knew that those girls in school wouldn't have picked on him knowing he would kill himself -- would they still have.  The girls in school blamed themselves.  Even after we are older now his name comes up sometimes and I recently heard one apologize again.      Another suicide was a friend of mine.  Stressed about his family.  He killed himself.  His last words were I shouldn't have done this.  He forgot that other people care.  He forgot that he was a straight A student going somewhere in life.  He forgot that soon he could more out of that crazy house.  And it only took him a minute of forgetting to do something he regretted or so was stated in his last words.  Which is know because his sister ran onto the porch grabbed the gun and heard him clearly.    They have many classes in school.  So why not a education class to educate people more on suicide.  If they don't go to church and don't believe in God then they need to at least be educated about it.      And so I have a question - people state the committing suicide should be illegal.. I'm confused how can it become illegal.  Who will be charged.  The person is already dead and going to hell.  That's punishment enough in itself.        Also yes i believe that it is a selfish act.  But at the same time some of them aren't planned out.  It's a split second reaction to a problem that controls into their mind.  Some people really need help.|`|q688OUsqaa	it's their body, but it's selfish, and it does harm people.

The committer wont have to live knowing what they have done to the people in their lives, but the people in their lives will always be plagued.

So my advice: don't give up on the day if there is a chance you might smile tomorrow.|`|TxETd4B1aa	It's selfish. People commit these acts to intentionally inflict pain on other people.

CCKFIUEuaa	Many people go through the exact same thing, so keep in mind that you certainly are not alone. Getting rid of this kind of thing is hard, because different people respond to different methods of treatment. You could see a psychologist about it, but try not to depend on medication. Alternatively, you could experiment with different types of expression. Music, art, film or writing could help. Talking to friends about it can REALLY take the pressure off as well. Suicide hotlines and such aren't that helpful unless you're about to kill yourself; and from what I gather from your question, you aren't seeking death, you're seeking life. You feel as though you've already died and it's too hard to feel alive again.   This feeling is very very hard to get rid of. It takes a long time and you have to keep yourself positive at all times. The best way to shake it, without professional help, is to just find something that you really enjoy doing. It will probably be an activity that you can do on your own and still enjoy very much, but also do it with other people and still have fun. It could be video games, playing an instrument, sport, cooking, designing - anything you can think of.   What you're feeling might ease and go away, and it might not. Again, it depends on the kind of person you are.|`|mUiQ2827aa	you know i have the same feelings.  sometimes when you look around things seems pretty f-ed up.  suicide seems like the solution but what you're really looking for can only be found here in life.  if you're religious you know how "god" feels about suicide and you will not find peace in the afterlife. if you don't believe, well then you're hoping it'll be better but you don't know.  you need to find what makes you happy in this world.  there will always be pain and suffering.  there will always be violence and hardship.      my suggestion to you is to talk to someone close to you.  there are very few people out there that will judge you if you come to them in genuine need.  your family and friends can help you through this if you come to them and express your feelings.  the best thing you can do is look for support in those that you are closest too.  you just have to remember you are not alone.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G Decide which infirmity would be the worst to be reborn with. That's what will happen to you when you suicide. In the meantime, use the LDK to make your life great.  Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.|`|Kl4kv5khaa	First of all that is not all of us.

But this theory is difficult to prove... seeing as all those who HAVE died in their sleep are dead, and can not tell us if they did in fact die in their dream as well. Of course, the only way to disprove this would be to have a dream where you die (and I don't mean just black out or get injured) I mean... DEAD, and live from it. If you have a dream like this and you wake up... then you know the theory is false.     As for dream premonition... you have nothing to worry about. A dream is just a slide show of the things a person experiences in life. Or, the hidden fears/feelings of the subconscious. It's not uncommon for soldiers to dream of death.

You are becoming more enlightened or spiritual. Alternatively, you are trying desperately to escape the demands of your daily life."  under 'die':  To dream that you die in your dream, symbolizes inner changes, transformation, self-discovery and positive development that is happening within you or in your life. Although such a dreams may bring about feelings of fear and anxiety, it is no cause for alarm and is often considered a positive symbol.  Dreams of experiencing your own death usually means that big changes are ahead for you. You are moving on to new beginnings and leaving the past behind. These changes does not necessarily imply a negative turn of events. Metaphorically, dying can be seen as an end or a termination to your old ways and habits. So, dying does not always mean a physical death, but an ending of something.    On a negative note, to dream that you die may represent involvement in deeply painful relationships or unhealthy, destructive behaviors. You may feeling depressed or feel strangled by a situation or person in your waking life. Perhaps your mind is preoccupied with someone who is terminally ill or dying. Alternatively, you may be trying to get out of some obligation, responsibility or other situation.         hope this gave you some info|`|BPnbK8wgaa	In one of my dreams, terrorists attacked the town I live in, and I died after catching a grenade so it wouldn't destroy the whole town. I actually saw myself die to, but nothing like that has ever happened to me. I've had that dream about five or six times now.|`|Vxaim3jPaa	ha ha it means     If your dreams die then you have no point in living anymore.
iHFZLsDTaa	This also happened in the 1980's.  You are probably too young to remember, or you were not born at that time.  It is not the worst as of yet.  And it is not as bad as the news is telling us.|`|OS3lreXVaa	if the globe is not like zero, in all exam?  health regular test, and clean, clear, simple, plain.  tomorrow may not be your days, next could be call for death sentence to many, none have news, good samaritan getting death sentance, no justice to real honesty. shame our learned great work for OSCAR!!
899c6a371bce238646502edb0cee925aaa	Social interaction involves complex psychological processes that nobody ever realizes.  I think at that point in time you are both processing the conversation according to the same social etiquettes, and so you decide that the same point in time is appropriate to break the silence with whatever comes to mind.    PS. you're lucky to have gotten this many responses to a question with no definitive answer.|`|mOVWQyyyaa	I have done that! Did you say the same thing at the same time, or did you just start talking at the same time? I've said something the same thing as someone else at the same time before.     I think it happens because, when you are having a conversation and you pause, you both think of something your about to say, and you both see the opportunity to say it, and both of you say it at the same time.    Sorry its a little confusing but I hope this helps!|`|YCvgjLdnaa	lol yeah ive done that, its quite embarrassing, you say something at the same time and laugh awkwardly and then go back to being silent. Its quite funny (not at the time...) if you think about it.  I think it just takes people a certain time to figure out what to say, and then you're both in a rush to start the convo going again so as soon as you think of it, you say it. It must take a certain amount of time for people to figure out what to say, because you're right people do say things at the same time.|`|KEAfTavqaa	It happens because for a second we don't know what to talk about, we run out of things to say, or we cant make up our mind about what we want to say. This is the reason why I have the awkward silence moments. Don't listen to the guy above.. he's mean!|`|HF3iyIGVaa	WOW you are a loser with no friends, get the hell off my internet.|`|ToILKl6waa	Ha - yes, it happens to me a great deal of time actually. It usually happens to me when I'm on the phone with this woman who I don't know very well. While talking, it's evident to us both that the conversation should hit it's closing point soon, so we both try to unawkwardly end it at the same time. And then it ends up awkward! But I just learn to laugh it off.|`|V8YlHXUAaa	OMG, me 2! It's nice 2 kno that I'm not the only 1! I think it's 'cuz u and ur friend r both tryin 2 break the silence & maybe the human mind has this limit for awkwardness or sumthin.|`|BoHH9EwRaa	They might mean to make things funny! cause one person is thinking of something to keep the conversation  flow and the others maybe thinking of some thing funny to say this happens to me all the time when i talk to a really cute guy lol!!|`|lztLa9FGaa	UH! i absolutely hate that! then when you say it at the same time, you're both like " oh no say what you were gonna say" and then they say the same thing. And then you don't know who should go first|`|zdPqht41aa	it happens cause in that pause your both wondering how to keep the convo going its common when the two ppl like eachother or are lying to eachother|`|OS3lreXVaa	yes!!!  certain things we just say WOW!!!  all have more then what we may think some times, numerous reason.  Simply, mystrious!!! isn't everthing in nature!  If no mysterous to you, would you find interest on any thing?and try hard to get any real valuable???pass on new.

I1w0HfQbaa	Yes, it makes sense. Especially if the woman has had her fill of sex partners a man does have the right to question whether or not the kid is his and demand a paternity test. It might seem harsh to some but it is equally harsh to expect to throw a man in jail or even garnish his wages to force him to pay back child support. If the kid isn't his then he doesn't have to pay. It's that simple.|`|qcDHyhdtaa	I second the motion.|`|ewybA08Iaa	DNA tests cost about $200.00.  Ask the court to defer the ruling until parentage can be determined, put up the @200.00, and use the results in the court proceedings.  If you are not the sire, you will save thousands of dollars.  If you are, oh well.  A reminder.  Please use a condom if you do not want to sire children.  Males have equal responsibility.|`|iHKJsyfTaa	How about ALL BIRTHS be DNA tested.

If he's on the birth certificate or has legitimated, then he's legally the father.

Most people 18-25 feel exactly the way you do, I suggest you see psychologist who can help you.|`|TxETd4B1aa	That sounds like bi-polar disorder which is characterized by mood swings.    What I don't understand is why you're lonely in college. College is the best place to socialize in the entire world. All you have to do is go to the Student Activities Office, find a list of school activities or groups and decide which ones you might interested in joining.    There's so much out there. You just have to know where to look.
tKWwZpOAaa	Start going places where everyone else is more attractive then her and comment on how pretty the other girls are. That might do it, or just get her really pissed at you.|`|AA11280073	Tell her this: "True beauty is on the inside. A beautiful person is kind, modest and respectful of other people's feelings. They do not brag or act like they are better than others."|`|s3YuchHoaa	Most people who rely on their outer beauty do not see their inner beauty and have low self esteem. The people with the biggest egos are usually people who are trying to make themselves feel better  about themselves because deep down inside they feel horrible.Let her know that even though she is beautiful it is the way she laughs that makes her so beautiful. That her mind is beautiful, her thoughts , her heart , her compassion for society,her love for her family.Whatever good qualities that made you want to be with her , let her know that those are the reason you are with her. Her looks just make it even easier to love her. Help her with her self pride about other issues because when she looks in the mirror all she is seeing is the most shallow level of herself and that depth that exists gleaming within her eyes captivated your heart at first glance .  The more love you show her instead of responding to her talking about her looks the better she will feel about herself and won't need to search for attention.|`|QEzap81yaa	ask your girlfriend to look around and observe life.i am sure she will find that there are people better than us and we are better than some. to have a balanced view in life is the best thing. you will enjoy what you have rather than begin sad about what you lack. you will feel humble and thank god for what you have when compared to those people who do not these things.<br>  Beauty is not skin-deep it radiates from the soul within.|`|e8aa8e418b72c63acc3e4ab908f8a79baa	Show her a picture of Sofia Loren - She was also Perfect... look at her now.

BsRZsOJVaa	When people see someone they perceive as shy, they treat them like they would treat a shy person, thus causing that person to act like a shy person.   If you think you yourself are shy, then you will act shy.|`|Id4aSqrPaa	introverted: within self, keeps to them self, is always them self no matter what the environment.     type B personality: non aggressive, non competitive, usually prefers jobs that require little to no stress/pressure    shy: prefers small groups, has few friends but they are close, avoids attention grabbing situations|`|YCvgjLdnaa	People who are shy are lacking in self confidence so are generally timid, and quiet. They don't like to be singled out, be the subject of the conversation or center of attention. They keep themselves to themselves and don't speak as often.   Shy people tend to blush/go red in difficult situations, and prefer being close to a couple of people rather than having many friends.  shy people are mostly calm and quiet, and are shy for a reason maybe with how they look, talk, where they come from it could be many reasons. or it could just be in their personality.|`|AA11239733	You need to eat peanut butter in large quantities. This should help clear up the rash.|`|0YQRbq9faa	Shy people tend to be introverted.  They prefer to focus on their inner world more than the outer world of people, places and things.    People who prefer introversion are energized and excited when they are involved with the ideas, images, memories and reactions that are a part of their inner world.  Introverts often prefer solitary activities or spending time with one or two others with whom they feel an affinity, and they often have a calming effect on those around them.    When you are introverting, you take time to reflect on ideas from the outer word.  Introverts like to have a clear idea of what they will be doing when they move into action.  With their orientation to the inner world, introverts truly like the idea of something, often better than the something itself, and ideas are almost solid things for them.    People who may prefer introversion may:    * be seen as calm and "centered" or reserved   * feel comfortable being alone and like solitary activities     prefer fewer, more intense relationships   * sometimes spend too much time reflecting and not     move into action quickly enough   * sometimes forget to check with the outside world to       see if their ideas really fit their experience|`|eiuEdujPaa	When you're shy you're basically afraid of people being critical of you personally. I used to be really shy. It was really cool when somebody just decided to walk up and talk to me because they thought I might be cool. Also, I don't really know what it feels like to be lonely because I'm perfectly comfortable being alone.|`|KPNOQAP4aa	a shy person has very little self-confidence. they don't feel like their opinion matters and feel like they don't have a say in their lives.  those people, like all of us, really need love! if you're asking this because you know someone who's really shy, spend some time with them and let them know they are special.  shy people also dislike and are intimidated by confrontational, controlling people.   if you are shy, take comfort in knowing that God loves you just how you are and that if you let him fill you with his love your righteousness will shine like the dawn!
KPNOQAP4aa	hmmm that's really strange. maybe you are gifted with deja-vu, lol  i think i've had that happen occasionally [i remember alot of my dreams after i wake up---sometimes for days] but i don't recall it happening very frequently. interesting!  keep dreaming....
cJPOs7Tsaa	Simple:  HAVE FUN!  I get the impression you're stuck in a rut. The everyday, predictable mundane routine brought this upon you. Go try something new. Get some fresh air and exercise maybe.    Try skydiving or bungee jumping. If the idea scares the chit out of you, then good. You'll appreciate life more when your feet are back on the ground. If it doesn't scare you, then you'll have a blast, and you'll be beaming about it to all your friends, and the experience will be completely uplifting.    No? Go fishing in a beautiful, serene place.    No? How about heli-skiing?    You get the idea, right? Go do something off-the-wall, that's completely not you, but sounds like fun. Fulfill a fantasy or something.    Hope you get better.|`|5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com. There are people there going through situations similar to yours. They are great for advice and encouragement.

Don't stay home, talk with friends and have fun.|`|yRYZcYp7aa	Try to do something else like play with friends,play games etc..|`|TxETd4B1aa	You need more excitement in your life. I would get out and do something challenging, like rock climbing or skiing.     You might also want to consider finding a more exciting job. I used to be bored at work as an accountant and then I moved into the forensic side working with law enforcement and now I love riding around with police officers going after bad guys. Each day I look forward to work and the challenges that it brings.
62QGG48Taa	LOL! I looked up on google it can mean that you feel like you are inlove with both genders...AWKWARD
QQQ36jMOaa	I think it speaks less of her character (as she hasn't accepted) and more of the character of the individual giving the offer.  Its almost like he's preying on her situation.  Of course he's going to make it an insanely sweet deal which will be difficult for a mother of 14 to turn down.  It becomes less about morals and more about her having to do what is necessary to care for the children.  And of course she can't afford to raid those children!  I thought that was obvious!<br>  <br>  I'm not sure I would think less of her (or another woman in her situation).  Heath care alone for 14 children is a fortune and 1 million would really help take care of them for a short while.  Yes, kids are just THAT expensive.  However, its a difficult situation to be forced into and I find it sickening that the director brags about approaching single mothers with no other options.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	I tell you she's definitely backed herself up into jam.  She just renewed the definition of "between a rock and a hard place; more like a boulder and a hard place.  <br>  She takes the deal it not only proves she can't afford to raise her kids; it proves she wasn't thinking in the first place.|`|BGNdKvXzaa	This deal will no doubt solve all Octop@$$y's short-term monetary issues.  However, lacking any credibility as she is, this deal would be suicidal with respect to receiving government assistance, asserting her moral character, and establishing some believability, all of which will follow her AND her children for decades.  These kids will have enough to contend with without the real probability that they will see their mother duking some dude on-screen.They are already talking about not allowing her to take the children home without making matters worse.|`|DEc1C9hkaa	I don't know what it would say about her character, I'm not that deep.<br>  <br>  Let's just hope she puts more serious thought into her decision to be in this movie than she put into having more children.<br>  <br>  She's backed herself (and has dragged her children right along with her) into a rock and a hard place.
GjmtdrUnaa	I don't really know of any test specifically.    However, Aspergers isn't the worst form of autism. As far as I understand this type, it affects you more socially than mentally and physically.    Since her grandmother won't let her do anything by herself, why don't you talk with her and consider sharing an apartment with her? That way she can feel more free. You can still keep an eye on her, but it won't feel like she has a lack of freedom to her.    If you can watch the movie Robby O'Shea Was Here. It's also called Inside I'm Dancing. This shows two disabled individuals, one can't move anything but his hand, living in their own apartment. They do have an assistant helping them, but not at all hours of the day. She didn't live with them. This movie might give you some ideas when it comes to convincing her grandmother. FYI though, lots of profanity, but it would be worthwhile for this situation.|`|VtxtY3hXaa	Yes but she would have a care taker with her or near|`|yuuvBSKsaa	Personally I'd go with the Darwinian test, though you might not approve of what flunking means.|`|AA10120665	There are tests that can be done.  Your friend sounds as if she can take care of herself to a degree.  Her grandmother is very protective of her and this should be appreciated.  Perhaps there is more about your friends condition that you are not privy to.  Eventually, she should live in a group home to become accustomed to being completely self sufficient.  She may not know how to manage a household and her grandmother will not always be around to supervise her.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	my sister has aspergers autism and lives on her own perfectly fine she has a few issues with keeping her house clean but she is only 19 but basically the only way the grandmother would have any say in what she can do is if she actually went to cort and got custody of her my mother and father didn't feel the need to do so and if she dose have custody of her she just has to get a lawyer and go to cort and prove that she can care for her self and she can live on her own
AXNowGPyaa	Definitely men are less accepting of "being just friends with someone they were romantically interested in." For a man, particularly a younger man, being put in the "just friends" class can be a very humiliating classification. It feels like your entire self-worth has just been crushed down to nothing. Even if there are a dozen women out there at that very second who would be glad to date you/sleep with you/rub you stomach and coo at you, if one woman you are really emotionally invested in shoots you down it is devastating. A lot of guys become players just to get away from that. They remove the emotional aspect completely and deal only on the sexual conquest level. If I were not a born poet I would have gone in that direction myself many years ago.     The area of interpersonal relationships is an area where women do seem to be biologically superior to men. I would recommend Gilligan's "In a Different Voice" for people curious about this. I really don't believe it is all nurture or nature, and that both play a critical part, as should be clear to anybody looking at how gender roles develop in certain societies and cultures. But it seems pretty obvious that each gender has different strengths, and friendship is obviously more up the females' alley.     But either gender can have trouble accepting "just being friends" with somebody they have built up a strong romantic interest in. Still, women are more likely to accept it, given that they value relationships in and for themselves more than men do.    But men will continue to pursue a woman they are sexually interested in for as long as that woman is within their immediate sphere of interaction. And honestly, women often decide a "friend" could be something more, so that is the obvious answer to your question: They continue to pursue because often it works out excellent for them. The guy above was right--you have to be very clear. Then be ready to have the guy stop acting like you exist.|`|iHKJsyfTaa	Women seem to have difficulty grasping the fact that most men ****Don't Take Hints****    Tell him " There is absolutely no way I will ever date or have sex with you"    If you want him to understand.|`|svOneExjaa	It really is an individual issue. Some people of both genders have hard time handling rejection. I mean no one enjoys it, but some let it slide over their heads, while others keep obsessing over it and making non-sense of themselves. I never could continue being friends with my ex-boyfriends. I always thought, that offering friendship instead of a romantic relationship to an obsessive individual spells some kind of a hope for the possibility of more favorable changes in a future for him / her. However, some people can and do so without any problems.|`|6H1ie8WXaa	Um, it's too difficult to say, even in terms of generalizations.|`|m06TDTtTaa	I think that it depends on the man.  It also depends on if they are being led on by the girl.      It isnt difficult for men and women to simply be friends, but it seems that in most cases one or the other will eventually have some romantic feelings for their "friend".   But what you do with those feelings is the important thing.     As far as who is less accepting, again it depends upon the person and the situation and how involved they are.|`|AA11530601	well its the same for some girls too, they would rather be "friends" with a crush than not freinds, but they just cant help but hope for more. I dont think its just a guy thing.    Having said that, some guys just wont take a hint and you have to do what "ryde-on" says, and i think its cause they mistake the friendliness for something more due to being trained in to the role of "the persuer" by society, so they are primed to look for "signals on interest" that they can act on.|`|T6xd0OxWaa	Don't know about that.   Have plenty of female friends I'm not interested in.   One I am interested in but, I don't want to mess up the friendship by asking her out.    As for the guys that keep asking women out, maybe the have a Steve Erkel complex.|`|TRZNCxGzaa	women, for sure.|`|K3SjpGvNaa	Well, I think that it all depends on how much the guy likes her. Some guys can just go "Aw man, look at that chick! She's freakin' hot! I'm gonna go ask her on a date," and it just happens that fast. Other guys think more like this, "I like this girl, so I'm going to get to know her then ask her to take it to the next level," or something along those lines. The situation you're talking about is usually with the second kind of guy. They'll get to know you, then you'll think that he wants to just be good friends, while the whole time he's wanted a little more. And if you stay just friends, sure he'll have a new good friend, but he'll always wonder, "Hmm, what if we did get together?" Like the old saying goes, curiosity killed the cat...|`|9a8dcc5b6d79b07abd75628d8b093129aa	It's the same.    It depends more on mindset and personality more than in gender.    Most men say that women are, most women the opposite, this is because of the gender war or because men never experience finishing relationships with other men and women never with other women.    It would be a huge generalization.

UXc6lMZBaa	I'm sorry if this interpretation seems insensitive. I really don't know how to do this right, but your question didn't have any answers. Take it with a grain of salt.    I think your baby isn't supposed to be a real baby- only a symbol of a combination of all possibilities that might never happen. She is totally surreal. She has black hair and purple or gray eyes. Black and purple are colors that are rarely found in nature, and are sometimes used to adorn or symbolize things that have to do with the supernatural. So she's kind of a "spirit" baby. Gray in eyes is kind of "cold," or distant, and I guess that it means that you will never really see her. The fact that you were calling her different names reinforces this idea. She stands for all the babies that you could have had, but might not.    The bowl of water? I guess it goes with the idea that this baby is a "spirit." Do you have/know about a conception of a place where people are before they're born? Is this where the baby goes to race?    She doesn't have a birth certificate because she hasn't been born.    Your mother doesn't know. She's busy with her own duties. I don't know what taxes symbolize in a dream. They might mean serving other people, willingly or unwillingly. Do you have younger brothers and sisters? This might be about how you think your mother helps them more than you.    The man putting tar on a house: I don't know how this works in real life. Do people normally spray tar on roofs? I thought it was part of the shingles. Anyways, your avoiding him might be something about not wanting to ask for help. Is it because you're afraid of getting the wrong answer, and finding out that the fact that you can't have children is set in stone? Not that it is, but don't be afraid of the truth, whatever it might be.    The dog: You don't remember much about it, so maybe it is less important. I guess it's something small that is bothering you.    Your grandmother not knowing might be the same as your mom not knowing. They have their own lives to live. And as for the hairyness and the tree trunk, it reminds me of Grandmother Willow from Pocahontas. I don't really remember what she did, but I think she gave Pocahontas good advice. Your own grandmother did too in a way. She told you, through the hospital thing, that nobody can help you but yourself.    I guess you should stop looking to other people for answers and go back to yourself.

AA10823062	Deep down, something is worrying and scaring her -- something so important that she cannot bear to deal with the problem itself.

vAdtlZDpaa	The dream is a reflection of your emotional state in your waking life. <br>  <br>  Your dream starts off at the ice rink. To see ice in your dream suggests that you are lacking a flow of ideas and thoughts. You are not seeing in progress in your life, or you may be feeling emotionally paralyzed or rigid. You need to let your feelings be known.<br>  <br>  Next you are swimming in the ocean. The ocean in your dream represents the state of your emotions and feelings. To dream that you are swimming, suggests that you are exploring aspects of your unconscious mind and emotions. The dream may be a sign that you are seeking some sort of emotional support. It is a common dream image for people going through therapy.  <br>  <br>  Next you are looking for a net, which is a symbol for a complicated life sitution, or something that makes you  feel trapped.  A fishnet in your dream indicates a fear of being found out or caught in the act.<br>  <br>  Next you are in danger from an explosion and electrocution. An explosion is a dream symbol for repressed anger or rage.  To dream of an electrocution signifies that the current course of your actions will lead to disaster, even death. You need to be more aware of your surroundings and those around you.<br>  <br>  However, you are saved by holding onto a bridge, which is a dream symbol for a critical junction in your life. The guy who helps you hides in the shower of your house. To dream of someone else is hiding indicates a need for security and protection. The bathroom in your dream relates to your instinctual urges. You may be experiencing some burdens/feelings and need to "relieve yourself". Alternatively, it may symbolize purification and self-renewal. You need to cleanse yourself, both emotionally and psychologically.<br>  <br>  Next, you kiss him twice.  To dream of a kiss denotes love, affection, tranquility, harmony, and contentment. Then you dream of going to a party and receiving gifts. To dream that you are at a party suggests that you need to get out more and enjoy yourself. To dream that you receive a gift indicates that you are being rewarded and recognized for your generosity and giving nature. <br>  <br>  The gifts that you receive are feather bed pads and a baby crib coverlet. These symbolize harmony, protection, warmth, and pleasant and comfortable circumstances. Consider the color and pattern of the bedding for additional significance. To smell something in your dream, indicates your past experiences and feelings with that particular smell. Your dream is trying to convey a feeling by associating it with a familiar smell or scent. <br>  <br>  I have no idea what this dream is about, but it sounds as though you were going through something kind of emotionally traumatic that could have really been dangerous in your waking life, and that it turned out OK due to the choices that you made.
AA11260610	Shush... don't say that out loud or the thought police AKA men in black will come and put one of those mind control things in your neck!<br>   I know it's true cause I saw it on TV and everyone knows TV wouldn't lie!|`|fO7H95s6aa	maybe because theyre true?<br>  maybe because the head of project blue book decided to turn the tables after so many years of "debunking" ufos and now is a posterchild for?<br>  maybe because people need a way to explain all the BS that does happen and look like conspiracy theorist weirdos who wont conform?<br>  maybe because youre afraid to accept the fact that maybe just an inkling of a fraction of zeitgeist might actually have some truth behind it? that there's a reason why theres an owl watching you on dollar bills?<br>  that j edgar hoover didnt follow martin luther king jr. around like he was osama bin laden himself? that bin laden is still at large and we dethroned a dictator who the bushs had a serious issue with from way back when but are still cleaning up that mess all for a vendetta?<br>  but youre probably right, im gonna watch fox news and give money weekly to a priest who molests little boys and a church with a history of manipluation and "cleansing", i mean its better than looking like a conspiracy theorist werido right?

There is no way to remove it after 5 years and will be hard to deny the urge to indulge in the fantasy. The best way to cope with your hidden desire is to really splurge on something socially related to the topic and trade one desire for another. Jade yourself to the lust involved in your urning and eventually you will have and easier time to overcome the uncontrollable aspect of what you are going through. It will never be completely overcome so the best chance you have is to bury it and bottle it up. To do this use your anger at the lost prospect and indulge in the unfair factor associated with his empty teasing of your rich desire.   Though, be warned, if he ever pursues you it will be your optimistic tendencies, as you seem to be an upbeat person, to read into something that, as you have seen after all this time, not really there and may undo all the suppression you have achieved to this point.  More then that, it appears that he considers you a friend and it can't proceed on a more personal level. He considers you a comfort zone, hence the friend, and that is no place to be in if you want more.  I hope this helps and good luck.
AA10510845	Sexual attraction is there for a purpose; to bring people together.  Often times it doesn't result in marriage.  And sometimes it happens within the marriage, but to the wrong person.  I believe it can be possible to develop an attraction, but it's certainly not everything that a good marriage is based upon. Physical attraction can start off hot, and then cool down considerably.  The honeymoon passion does not last forever. What takes its place is care, comfort and companionship, the sharing of ideals, and building a home and family.  So you have to ask yourself what's really important to you, and to be fair to this man, you have to find out what he wants in a marriage.  Marriage means compromise and making sacrifices, too.  I didn't mean to lecture you, but I'm just stating the pros and cons.  Just find out what's in your heart and go with it.  Good luck!|`|TxETd4B1aa	That's pretty stupid. Unless they are in the process of upgrading their appearance. You can tell right away if someone is attractive.|`|Id4aSqrPaa	the thing is if the attraction isn't there it may never be there. physical attraction can be ignored but sexual attraction is different. if yall only had sex twice then that may not be there either. if there is no physical/sexual aspect to your relationship then your missing a very important part of your relationship. eventually u may stray to find that missing part in someone else.     he may or may not be desperate, he may be a genuinely nice guy who cares for you and wants to take care of your family. but unfortunately if he does nothing for you you'll end up in  a loveless marriage.    neither one of you deserve that. you deserved to be taken care of, but u deserve to love and be loved too and so does he.|`|OS3lreXVaa	physical is easy. can you do 50 push ups!?  how risky. how safe?how dangerous to others?even safe though real dangerous?drive safe............................//|`|AA11216736	yes it could but honestly he is acting like a wussy and i dont think you ever will find him attractive unless he changes. he is being too nice to you.  and yes to your final question. i agree with the person who said you need a little of both to make it in the long run|`|DqmMW2tcaa	Yes defiently. Sometimes it takes a while for the physical attraction to build, but if you really don't feel anything after a while then the relationship isn't probably going to last. I think you need both emotional and physical attraction for a relationship to last the distance.
Fsq9qvkqaa	Of course. Everything you bring in to examining an idea can be affected by your ideology, your preconceived notions, what you have been raised to believe, and your own personal experience. If you were a strong believer in a divine being, then if you were to look at the evidence supporting evolution you would obviously look for flaws in the theory, and hold it up next to your beliefs and decide what is right and what is wrong. The same goes for someone who believes in evolution who is examining the idea of creationism. That is why it is important to keep an open mind, look at ALL the evidence, and then decide for yourself what you believe.|`|b5ad6e44e0086d316700f9b6713407c6aa	Yes, but the problem is that there is no scientific evidence that supports creationism. I find that many people who support the idea that god made everything on the planet and that populations do not change over time are using opinion in their arguments, not science.<br>  <br>  Warrior- there is some evidence that EVENTS written about in the bible occurred- that doesn't prove the creationism of the bible. I could very easily write a book and say "The great and powerful oz turned all of the sand of the world into diamonds and then a devastating hurricane hit New Orleans" Just because the hurricane part is true doesn't mean the diamond part is.<br>  However, there is plenty of scientific evidence for evolution. (fossil record, homologous structures, mtDNA testing...to name a few) Evolution isn't even a theory, it's a scientific fact- when people say "evolutionary theory", they are talking about the mechanisms of evolution, not evolution itself.|`|O8n3FYK0aa	Yes, I would look for an answer as you said "before I even start." <br>  --FallingAngel, What about all the archaeological evidence that supports the validity of the Bible?|`|d265DZbHaa	Evolution is fact - Creationism is the desperate delusion of the religiously correct|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	people decide based on belief and life experience.<br>  <br>  thats how they make decision.|`|GX6QOm0iaa	We are evolution of monkey, the story of adan and eve is a tale outside fashion, but the genesis story also is a metaphoric vision over the disposable woman for the legend of snake and the false devil...|`|ezP95Lq6aa	Duh, of course.|`|956663a3028055c8e593046e569fa61daa	It could, yes.  That's why the scientific method requires testing and retesting and constantly looking at the data to see if the hypothesis works for it.  Look, scientists aren't just talking out of their @sses here.  There are thousands of us who rely on evolutionary theory every day in our work, and there are thousands of dead or retired scientists who did the same.  Any one of us would be absolutely thrilled to truly overturn evolutionary theory and replace it with our own, better one.  I mean, my goodness, look what it did for Darwin, and Newton, and Einstein.   The fact is, evolutionary theory has withstood the test of time.  There are bits that still need ironed out, but there's nothing like the holes in Newtonian physics that required Einsteinian physics to work out.  Depressingly for those of us who seek glory, evolution works all too well.  Maybe I should've been a physicist.<br>  <br>  Science is subject to the prejudices of its practitioners.  Okay, I'm actually an archaeologist, not a biologist (but it still holds true that I rely on evolutionary theory and many of the branches of science that bolster it, like geology).  We know very well about prejudice.  Take, for instance, the theory of Man the Hunter.  Y'all know this one, because it just won't die in pop culture.  Man, the Mighty Hunter, stepped foot on the New World way back in the day, saw the mighty megafauna that flourished here, and went about slaughtering it all.  It's supposedly why the New World doesn't have any pack beasts or anything bigger than a bear when we used to have giant sloths and mammoths and all that crazy sh!t you see in the museum.  Women don't appear in this myth, except to process the meat and carry around babies.  Kids are hardly seen, either.  This myth was, not surprisingly, developed during the 1970s, a time when a certain type of back-to-nature masculinity was important.  It was sort of an old-school Fight Club kind of thing, but with clubs and mammoths.<br>  <br>  Problem is, the evidence does not support this theory.  Too bad, too, because it was a really, really popular one.  I mean, if you're a dude, can't you see it?  Striding across a brave new world, spear in hand, hunting the mighty mammoth?  Turns out, though, that people've been over here, coexisting fairly peacefully with the mammoths (and the sloths and the rest) for at least a few thousand years, and possibly much more.  All of a sudden, we couldn't possibly be the reason for the great megafauna die-off, because we were here too early.  And then those pesky feminists pointed out that, you know, most hunter/gatherer groups rely on the gathering of women, not the hunting of men, and that women tend to take a far bigger role in hunter/gatherer society than we think.  And then someone else said that humans aren't really big game hunters all that often, anyway, and it seemed doubtful that we'd be spearing a new giant sloth every week when it was much safer to go after smaller grub.<br>  <br>  And so an immensely popular theory died (mostly), because there were still plenty of people who weren't invested in it so much that they ignored the evidence that was actually there, in front of them.  Hell, the discovery of the pre-Clovis people (the ones that pushed back the settling of the New World) made the career of the guy who led the dig at Meadowcroft, as well as reportedly giving him quite a complex about being as careful as possible in your dig techniques.  No, overturning old myths isn't easy, but it's totally possible, and we've seen it done.  No one's even put a chink in evolutionary theory's armor, so I think we're safe.
cf7e502388f77678bbc75e745e427e26aa	"I feel no one loves me, except my family."   That sounds like a pretty darn good place to start!     Maybe you should let that best friend go; but since they're still (maybe) not "too far gone," ask them exactly why: was it bc of something *you* did, or bc the other friends didn't like you.

With the plane crash and dead bodies, that could mean that tragedy has struck, or will, soon, if your friend has prophetic dreams? And even though it has, or will, your friend will still fight to help you.
BJKQhYuIaa	Communists try to settle a :  egalitarian, classless, stateless society   There are different schools of communism:LEninism,Stalinism Maoism,Jache and... .I belive you asking for 3 principles of Stalinism :  1.The groundwork for the Soviet policy concerning nationalities, laid in Stalin's 1913 work Marxism and the National Question, praised by Lenin.    2.Socialism in One Country,   3.The theory of aggravation of the class struggle along with the development of socialism, a theoretical base supporting the repression of political opponents as necessary.

mjDdy67Jaa	maybe, social worker, counselor, teacher, or sociologist|`|QZeCUEJRaa	Loads! One piece of advie to start with - get out there and get work experience, especially volunteering. I go to a top 10 university, studying Social Science, it has been very hard for this year's graduates to find jobs. Only about half have even got interviews, tey ere the ones with volunteering expereince. No volunteering and/or work experience, equals no job. Don't worry, you have plenty of time to get some!     Now, for the opportunities. The degree subject doesn't matter as much as the class, university and experience you have. While Sociology has been regarded as a 'softer' degree for years, that doesn't mean you have bad prospects. Jobs in fields such as the Criminal justice system (police, courts, probation etc), social work, teaching/lecturing, social research, community work and Politics (eg think tanks, jobs in parties) are all logical steps to take. A law conversion is also a good possibility, the degree would be useful. Further study, for example an MA, would also enhance your prospects massively.     You can theoretically do almost anything with your degree, getting the interview is the hard part. Cramming your CV with as much experience as possible is the best way to do this, as well as makin sure you get a 2i or higher - then you're set! Hope this helps :)|`|HYQgnNVtaa	Not a whole lot, unless you go to grad school.
qHwfuNKIaa	Good question, my goal here is to suggest that the government’s response to current crisis is totally wrong. First, think about the national (treasury) debt, and how it’s more than doubled in eight years. Think about the interest payments and how we must literally print new money and sell more debt, just to keep current. Idea #1, sell the treasury debt to corporate America as zero coupon bonds. Big business shipped jobs overseas looking for short-run profits. They made the profits but now we don’t have jobs, we’re paying less in taxes, so yesterday’s windfall recipients need to pony up for their shortsightedness. Gov can buy back the debt when corporations go back to hiring income-tax paying Americans, which may result in increased tax revenues and balanced budgets… <br>  <br>  Next, we let the bad banks fail. I mean, they must be grossly mismanaged if they can’t borrow money from the Gov at 1%, lend it to credit card users at 20%, and still not make money. Right away, banks and county governments auction off all of the allegedly ‘distressed’ properties, so that folks who’ve been responsible with their money, can get into houses, get 'em current on property taxes, and get things moving again. But, I don’t see much advertising to liquidate all these foreclosures everyone’s talking about. I don’t see current listings posted at my banks, so I don’t really believe that a ‘mortgage meltdown’ ever happened. In defense of my allegations, when I look for bank owned properties, all I find are satellite photos from Google Earth. <br>  <br>  Last point is that interest rates need to RISE. America is an aging nation of boomers. Boomers saved money until 1999-2000, when the economy really began it’s downward death spiral. The Gov, with it’s sleazy-money-keep-rates-low mentality, has forced boomers into risky dividend-paying stocks in order to earn a living. But, since the economy has been so bad, for so long now, boomers lost their ‘assets.’ I’m going to throw this thought in for good measure. If you don’t understand ‘boomer plight,’ let me assure you that when you’re ~40, and no one will hire you because your insurance costs too much, you’ll begin to understand boomer plight. You’ll need interest income to get by. Returning to interest rates, we’re told that banks lack liquidity. What better way to create much-needed banking liquidity than to provide incentives for putting money into banks? 4-5% ‘passbook savings’ rates will get the economy moving again, as money flows into the banking system. <br>  <br>  That’s all. I mean, if I documented every mistake the FedGov made to get us into this mess, it would take ~1071 pages.|`|3928ccf010c3c956e363056a7e98cce0aa	Teach people how to spend only what they have and not use credit all the time.|`|V0BMSedJaa	Be bold and pony up a trillion some dollars to solve the financial/banking crisis.

wKbEKg0Paa	First, get to know the demographics of the people at your workplace. What percentage are males and females? What is the ethnicity of the people at work? What are the religious affiliations of the people at your workplace? When you've learned to respect the more visible demographic differences, work on personality differences. Understand that some people want more private space than others, that some need time to get comfortable with groups, and that some have different work styles.

yX4xVukPaa	I disagree with the other answerer - ethics and justice are both objective standards. People may differ about their content, but in concept they are both standards to which we refer.    They are important because they are in a way two sides of one coin - ethics is substantive - when we ask "is this ethical?" we are asking if the action contemplated is objectively right (not whether or not we personally agree with it).    Justice is subtly about procedure - if we ask "is this just?" we're not just asking about the result - the deed itself - but the procedure that leads to the deed.    For example, in law, reference is made to "principles of natural justice" which, it's said, are basic standards for deciding issues between two parties fairly - things like "no one can be a judge in their own cause" and "both sides must be heard".|`|TXNJUbAxaa	It isn't very important to ethics.  Ethics are the individual's own ideas on what will bring about the greatest good.  These are based on his own data and logic.    Justice is an action the group takes against an individual when they believe he has violated the laws of the group.    A person could criticize another person and bring about an upset.   This is an ethical matter.  An individual choice.  Justice doesn't really care until he picks up a gun and shoots the guy.  Justice may not even pay too much attention to someone criticizing someone else until they were so depressed that they took their own life.      Justice is a fairly blunt instrument as the whole group has to agree to it.  Whereas ethics is infinitely subtle because it is interpreted by an individual.

Be nice to her and say hi the next time you see her.|`|NGwxbzEWaa	I think you have feelings for this girl, whether you like it or not. Comforting this girl during a rough patch means you want to protect her, and it's like you want to be her "guardian angel" :)    well that's just what i think|`|kf9fSVOYaa	usually dreams mean the oposite of what they are so find an opposite in it|`|GgVJzDjDaa	you said she was being abused by he girlfriend. Maybe you feel bad for that and in your dream you are comforting her, just as you would want to do in real life. When you said she was hurt and you needed to find her, maybe (and again) you really want to help her out and/or get to know her.|`|qKSH6Cu0aa	First of all, dreams usually embody the snippets of images and scenarios of a person's waking day. If you go to school with this girl, even if you don't know her personally... it wouldn't be unusual for you to dream about her or other random people in your life. The only reason you recognize her in your dream is because you see her at school once in a while.     Have you ever thought about the faceless/nameless others in past dreams? They were NOT fabricated by your mind, you most likely saw them at a grocery store or shopping mall or other random/anonymous places. The only reason SHE stands out is because you see her more frequently than the other fillers in your dreams.    When I say dreams USUALLY embody the waking life, it's true. But sometimes a dream makes up the subconscious motives of the mind. It may be quite possible that you are subconsciously concerned/anxious about something at the moment. Are you stressed out over school? This girl probably has nothing to do with those feelings of anxiety.     If you dreamt you were close to this "friend", perhaps you long to feel closeness in your real life... not necessarily her. Injury and death in dreams symbolizes weakness. Do you feel stressed out over a weakness in your life? Feeling the need to "find" this girl symbolizes you trying to solve your own problems.     Basically, you weren't running away from your problems, you were running toward the solution!|`|rrHUU3Gqaa	This dream does sound like you could have feelings for her, but it could also say that you are just good at giving advice, and caring enought to lend a hand to someone u dont really know that well.

bb7cc37c884e0d86b0b8f3f44235f9b3aa	It is possible, I've done it before during my dream dictionary phase, you just need to concentrate. Many people will tell you that it's not possible and it's true that you may not be able to however if you want to do it it may take a while.    It's more of a mind over matter thing, at least it was for me. If you know it's possible then you're more likely to be able to do it.     OK, first you need to be in bed, ready for sleep. It should be quiet and dark. Now you have to talk to yourself. have a discussion, if you will, about what you want. It's more about repeating it and making it fresh in your mind so when you fall asleep it will be at the surface of your conscience.    This technique may take a while, you may have to do it a few nights in a row to get the desired results. Also, since we tend to only remember a small portion of our dreams when we wake up you might not even realize that it worked. Keep in mind too that people usually dream about things we see and do that day.    Well I hope that help. And if it does work you might want to try my favorite thing to do, when you're falling asleep remind your that you're in bed, going to sleep and therefore you will soon be dreaming. This can lead to the best thing ever; having a dream where you know you're dreaming. Trust me, it's cool.|`|hyo4tWv9aa	i dont know ,but i think i can do it sometime but it cant be very specific 4 example if u want a exotic dream about u and someone u like u might have 1 ( rare) but mostly likely it would be with some1 else =S|`|R8N2QTU9aa	what you think about is what you dream about;;; in your sleep it tends to get very weird sometimes but you can train your thoughts to be good instead of bad... i do it all the time|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	I dream about what I want to some times.

I thought everyone did that? lol...|`|dgFudviSaa	yes, you should try lucid dreaming!|`|I6dcRgD6aa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream...

I find mine will go along with the TV or radio if I fall asleep with them on. One night I was on the back of a motorcycle with my bf, Barack Obama, driving it. He was going to the White House. I told him I couldn't go because I was a felon so he told me he'd never forget me and drove off.  When I woke up the news was on and they were covering his campaign.  I figure there must have been a commercial or a clip of a motorcycle too.|`|GZCmyzBYaa	no it depends on what is bothering you or is good i your life at that time, ect.|`|D3agflP1aa	well if u think about something too much or try not to think about it u will dream about it becuase it is in ur mind and u cant help but think about it while ur asleep|`|vbvvFVmVaa	if you think about one thing before sleep,  something similar to or that one thing will come up in a dream. it happens to me all the time|`|s1Sj3u5faa	it kind of seems like what you think about before you go to bed a lot of times appears in your dreams.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	I don't think so...unless you think about something right before falling asleep, then you may dream about it.    The only power i have over my dreams is being able to demand myself to wake up. Comes in handy during the scary parts =)|`|Y8OzKATsaa	It is possible. Although I was never able to do it, I have met many who can. I guess you tell yourself to dream something. It's like making a decision, telling yourself to do something. I'm not exactly sure how. Different people do it in their own ways.|`|cLSaq5qaaa	yes ,if u want to dream about something pesifice just keep thing about when you are falling asleep.And if you have so many dream cathers like me and you never dream anything i mean it.lol .no seriesly|`|BHeBSGemaa	There is something called lucid dreaming, that while you're dreaming, you can realize that you're in a dream and change the course of the dream if you want to. In order to do this, during the day or during "waking life" you need to ask yourself if you're dreaming, and you should pinch yourself and switch the lights to see if you're dreaming. When you obviously know that you aren't, you need to ask yourself this anyways. Then when you actually ARE dreaming, these things will happen. Good luck!|`|55xYyKOEaa	Yes : just keep thinking about it as you sleep usually i get something different but in common of it|`|Sq1p3zJSaa	Kinda, what you last think/see before you sleep greatly affects your dream|`|f8l91jheaa	you are the stupidest person on the internet right now.|`|mDTkpuiuaa	yeah i do it all of the time|`|he3O1RFUaa	You can sometimes influence what you dream about by thinking about the thing you want to dream about a lot before you go to sleep, but there is no definite way.|`|rgqDS5VKaa	If you want to dream about someone talk or see that person before you go to sleep.|`|1oMMx4W0aa	i believe its possible. for example if u like think about something really hard before u go to sleep, u might end up dreaming about it. You cant control wht happens, but i believe if u really put your mind to it u can control the subject you dream about. I have done it a couple times and it works.|`|ccded6c1859c9ef04f029c1502be58d9aa	Yes, its possible, and all I have to do is think of what i want to dream about. When I was little I used to do it all the time. I would choose to pick up on the dream I had the night before, like a mini-series? lol It seems now that Im older I dont do that as often, I just sleep.|`|f6851264bc5d56ceb1264b29ddb15bddaa	Yes it is, how?  Well it worked for me  For example, i like this guy and i want him in my dreams right?  so i was thinking aboutt him all dayy, talking about him, rememberr the moments and blahh  before going to sleep I justt startt rememberiing, thinkingg, closedd my eyess, and there he was.. lmaoo  LIkee justt think aboutt smthingg the wholee dayy or even next dayy  it mightt workk =]]|`|E7FjVzMwaa	Yes, just think about it hard until u gone to sleep. Gud luck.|`|hWHFWRAlaa	yeah! you just need to think about it alot (before bed) but if something is bothering you, you will probably dream about that or have a nightmare D-: about it. sometimes i forget about what i was dreaming about, thats annoying.|`|RX9rGdXAaa	noo|`|NbS7g5ryaa	I'm a very light sleeper and when I have a bad dream or something I could chose to wake up or if I have a good dream I could stay a sleep. Many times I have tried to control what I am dreaming about just for the fun; to see if you really can control a dream. Well, I didn't work too well, I was thinking about what I wanted to happen during my dream but it didn't happen but when I tried to change something in my night-mare it kind of did work because I was still a sleep but my night-mare wasn't so bad after. So I think some people maybe able to control their dreams, especially if you are a light sleeper, so basically during your dream just think about what you want to happen. Who knows? It just might work!          Hope I helped! =D|`|YCvgjLdnaa	Dreaming is a complicated thing, to do with the mind and how it works. but we cant decide exactly what we dream of.  Whatever you dream of depends on what you're thinking and whats on your mind, however if you fall asleep thinking of something you want to dream about, that doesnt work - unfortunatly -  xxx
XvO4iLk0aa	G Ijust use the LDK for half an hour. It works better than a massage and is a lot cheaper.  Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.|`|HunSyQaSaa	with music|`|Y8OzKATsaa	Music, writing, hitting something, sleeping, and eating.

I don't drink expensive coffees. I buy bottled tea about once every three months, then haul water in those bottles (disinfected with bleach weekly) to work. I do a lot of my own cooking, and my family gardens and preserves. We eat processed foods, but only when the convenience is high and the price is low. There is no public transportation where I live -- the nearest bus stop is 7 km away.     To help the economy, we need to spend our money on valuable, long-lasting things. We need to retrofit our houses with solar, so we can spur that industry and also to help with some of our electric needs. We need to put in insulation. We need to look into passive solar alternatives. We need to learn to grow our own foods -- not all, but some. This will help us appreciate just what we are getting in the grocery store!     We need to put the money into education, and into research. Not into Happy Meals. Not into stupid and violent entertainment.    I think those are some things that might help. We do need to keep spending -- but we need to realize that every dollar we spend is a vote for the kind of civilization we want.

You get a lot of it with Muslims these days, you try saying "actually, I'm a Muslim" (whether you are or not) and watch their jaw drop!

Many people speak out against social equality, homosexuality and other social issues online because they aren't saying what they believe face to face with someone. When you speak your mind with a group of people, there's a chance that they could hit you or scream at you and therefore you feel inferior and wrong.

Passion - an all encompassing sexual attraction;  2. Intimacy - the need to have emotional closeness; and  3. Commitment - a voluntary desire to maintain a relationship on a long-term basis.      The Kind of love experienced ultimately depends on which of these components are present. As summarized in Sternberg's triangle (http://sudharshan.files.wordpress.com/20...    So the difference between Infatuation and Romantic or even Consummate Love, comes down to the level of intimacy. Infatuation occurs when you feel passionate about someone and committed to them, while still being at a emotional remove.    This is just a theory though, the reality is often more complex than this. One day scientists may discover the exact chemical equation for the different kinds of love, and then we may have a more precise definition of it. (They're working on it - see here -http://www.oxytocin.org/oxytoc/love-scie...    In the meantime, there is is a great Wiki How to that may help you tell the difference between the two states in the context of a real relationship (http://www.wikihow.com/Know-the-Differen...    Hope I have helped.|`|4Vchxp32aa	I really think it's strictly your prospective on the situation.  Two different people can have the same feeling for the same person (theoretically, probably not in practice) and one could be considered it love and the other infatuation.  It's all about your perspective.
6pbZACUMaa	Japan's economy is the second largest in the world.  Japan is not growing as fast as it once did  due to aging and a low birth rate; the working population has been contracting.|`|c59485c5fb066f0af7ae58a856c4b126aa	Good question. I live in Japan, and while the economy isn't considered strong, it's not totally sucky. I mean, I still have a job that's basically a frill.     I think a big part of the problem is that the world economy hasn't been very good, and Japan depends on exports. Also, a lot of the other countries are getting better at producing things, and Japan has had to fight against competition from China (amongst other countries).     They also may be leery of "big growing economies" because that tends to make the yen stronger. Stronger yen means that Japanese goods are more expensive, and it's harder to sell them overseas. So, perhaps the policy makers have been just trying to hold steady.
AA10287830	I don't think reading is a bad thing at all.  If you have to have an obsession you picked a good one.  It will increase your vocabulary unlike any other activity you could choose.  Ask your parents if it's the reading they object to or the fact that you are reading online.  Maybe they just don't want you sitting at a computer for such long periods of time.  If that's the case then you can switch to printed material.  Good luck!  And keep reading.|`|zkyKXyYfaa	Don't get rid of it. It's good to read =)|`|oFV48JbGaa	If it makes you so happy, that you refer to it as your "therapy" and it helps improve your vocabulary...I don't think there's any problem with it at all.

65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	Bingo! You said it yourself.  Kick the booze.  If you are blacking out, girl you are in big trouble.  If you can go out and sip soda with a cherry in it or something like that, no problem.  But if you need the alcohol to get you going and boost your self esteem, you will lose every time.    If your friends are your friends, they will even help you cope with the transition from drinking  to something other than.  If they won't do that, I hate to tell you this, but they are not your friends.  If you have to go it alone,  make contact with Alcoholics Anonymous you will make fast friends there.  I just checked and did not find a toll free number to get a list of local chapters. but if you google it, you can get all the information in the world. (no pun intended).   Best of luck to you!|`|ZaYyXiJAaa	Just don't drink. It may be easier said than done, but it's possible. If you stop drinking, you will create your own personality and not blend in with your friends. You don't have to drink to still be friends with them, and if they have an issue with you not drinking, then they aren't a true friend. You don't have low self worth! Once you see the person you can be, you feel much more confident in yourself.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	You can still go to the bar to hang out with your "friends," but if drinking is becoming such a problem for you - stop! Order something without alcohol - pop, sodas, etc. Or find a new group of people to hang out with that don't spend all their time getting wasted.    It's possible/probable that the guy is just trying to brag about his conquests, when nothing really happened or he can't remember either. Don't beat yourself up so much. People make mistakes.|`|plOfDn2qaa	Stop drinking, since you are unable to drink socially and stop when it's getting to be too much - don't drink when you go out. If you can't handle being with your friends when they drink, then find new friends and interests. It's not becoming of a lady to act that way.     Good luck and don't worry hopefully you will outgrow this habit.|`|2aEU1lmpaa	Your decisions=your life.  Not your friend's lives, your life.  Make decisions that will make your life happy, not sad, good not bad, and if your friends want to make fun of you and call you a whore when you make a bad decision, guess what?  They are NOT your friends, they're just humans you spend time with.  Find some true friends who love you for who you are and support you.|`|Rd3IivxCaa	i can't even begin to tell you how many stupid things I've done after drinking.  Luckily, I quit drinking, but not before I made a lot of mistakes.    U should learn from it, and stop drinking because you will keep doing stuff like this when you drink.  It takes over your brain.      If this is the last time you goof up, consider yourself lucky.  Only you can change your future.  Forget the past.  We all make mistakes
AA10510845	Well, if you don't like the way life is treating you, then make your own changes.  You don't have to follow in the Asian traditions if you don't want to.  As long as you're under your parents' supervision, you have to follow their rules, but as soon as you're on your own, you can do what you please.  And I hope you make the right choices.  Not to stereotype any one ethnic group, but I have found Asians to excel in everything they do.  You have a lot of potential, so don't waste it by feeling sorry for yourself.  Good luck!|`|t2R3mEMoaa	Sounds like you are carrying quite a load on your shoulders including stuff that isn't even yours. Maybe it's time to find out who you are and what you want to do with your future life. You may have to be obedient to your parents for now but one day you will be old enough to step out into the world and be who you want to be, hopefully it is not the image you have of white people. You can only do what you can do, no more and no less. In the end it is you that has to face you every single morning and it is only you that can make change in your life and role model for other asian people as well. There is more to life than SAT's!|`|trMsK86jaa	Personally i'm of the opinion that if a person thinks life is bs, it's most likely because people are ensuring it.|`|AA11216736	yea steelers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  just stop thinking so negative have confidence in yourself study as much as you think YOU need to. aCE the test. if you know you did good and everybody thinks otherwise tell them to **** off and dont let them interfere with your happiness.

CxoogGzxaa	I haven't really been able to find a "complete" guide myself. The closest one I've found so far is this:    http://psychology.about.com/od/statesofc...    You will probably need more than one website/source to get the answers and theories that you need. A lot of sites are very narrow in their views and theories about dreams.     A search tip is to try using the keywords 'dream theories'.
63a5e4aa71cbea07611f89f87df0073eaa	At first, you were accompanied by your father.  He may have represented security, safety, or stability in your dream.  He may also have been with you in the dream so that you could stand to 'see' what was happening.    The world around you was broken - with warning signs and danger shown in visible and concrete images.  As you walked towards the end of the sidewalk (which was cracked - meaning the foundations of the city had been damaged), you may have either felt strong enough to no longer have needed the image of your father to provide the safety and security you originally needed - or, you may have felt so disturbed and shocked by the events that your perception of safety and stability was 'broken' enough that your dream self could not accept that your father could protect you or 'prevent' the world you dreamt of from remaining broken.|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	hmm... try this website -->http://www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionar...    but to see destruction usually means that there is disorder or inconsistency in your life. To see caution signs or road blockers and then see something broken usually indicates a warning in life that you did not heed and there were negative consequences as result. Also seeing a parent signifies authority and safety. Since your father disappeared at the end of the sidewalk it could indicate a poor decision that you made and there is no one to "bail you out" or help you and that you need to face the consequences alone. Also, if you were standing next to a road blocker at the end of the dream it could mean that you no longer want to make any decisions because of a poorly made decision.    I hope that that helped  :)|`|AA11830517	easy: say this aloud.....

8di0rKm1aa	not sure about how much you make, but i want to be one|`|uakYPM1faa	Basically, you don't become a scientist for the money.     For a PhD program you will be making a stipend of $24,000 a year (NIH standard)--this is AFTER you have a bachelor's.   When you finish that you can expect to do one or two post-docs, about 2 years each for $40,000 a year--this is AFTER you have a doctorate.  Then you can get an associate professorship.    If you plan to go into industry you can work a 9-5 and may or may not make more after the PhD but if you're a competent/intellegent person you can make easily make more money in business.    You don't go into neuroscience for the money. You do it because you love it or because you feel an obligation to give back to society.    I have some scientists I've worked with that have made an extremely lucrative career out of the discipline. But it's unwise to count on this for your life.
67204bd052a33365d7bd0f82da0dcc95aa	They have those skills, they simply have to be recognised as such and given respect...the traditional 'male' styles of management, development and organisation don't necessarily have to be the only or best way of doing things.

DuLhv7Ajaa	I think its because people tend to ramble on about things you're really not interested in.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	It is individual's willingness and taste.

It's a bit conceited thinking this way but I think it's common.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Because we are self absorbed.|`|C0K3Bo2Aaa	Maybe the tone of the person speaking, the length of time they are speaking or the topic? I used to fall asleep in school all the time. I was bored to death. Another reason for the mind to wander.|`|h6WbOpuhaa	Most likely the reason we have a hard time listening is because may be we aren't interested in what others have to say. Whether is could be boring, not amusing, etc.      And day-dreaming is something where to mind wanders freely, we can think and imagine anything, so that might be why it's easier.
el8yX5q3aa	With this stimulus plan...worse.  You can't give money away without someone paying for it..that means higher taxes.....So many other things go with it.

To dream that your wallet has been stolen, indicates that someone may be trying to take advantage of you.

It's called "declaring bankruptcy."    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy    Yes, the guy who has shown restraint and managed his/her money wisely does not get the debt written off. OTOH, they have the pride of managing their money well, and it's likely they won't go into debt, whereas people who declare bankruptcy sometimes get in trouble again and again. Their reputations are damaged, too, which makes it harder to do business.    I dunno -- I think it's better than the Poor Houses of earlier times, or being indentured servants or whatever.
ufb32uRdaa	forgive me if i am wrong. but wahtever i will say comes from my personel experience.  you always look sad. you cant even smile when u see someone. you look scared. people get disturbed by your expression and ask u why you look so sad. and u deep inside get pissed of because u dont like people tellin u that. because you are not what you show on ur face. your face is like automatic.without u knowing it will look sad.  it will gradually go away after your problems in your life decrease. i am sure u have lot of problems in your life and at the same time you are too ambitious and you are scared your problems will block you from your ambition. inshort you r highly ambitious person with a lot of problem.   but trust me every thing will be fine. just believe on yourself and smile.  god bless you  suyesh|`|iHFZLsDTaa	You were born with this.

If he's in his teens, then he probably doesn't know how he's supposed to act in a crowd.    Just pay close attention -- you don't want to give up something as important as friendship, but you don't want to be severely damaged by it.

But remember that it wont always be a smooth ride, and u must love each other when it hurts, and enjoy the good times. And don't be with someone just because he's cute or nice to u. He may not be nice 4 long. I f he sells himself to u by naming his qualities and what he can do 4 u, also watch out, this is how problems start. Basically know what he likes, and cater to him when hes in need, and make sure he does the same.|`|3862H0WVaa	It's gonna take a little time. A little time to think it over.

Wj212FWXaa	i looked this up on dreammoods.com last week bc i had one of those dreams too... go to the site and click the dream dictionary section to look up all sorts of stuff    Pregnant    To dream that you are pregnant, symbolizes an aspect of yourself or some aspect of your personal life that is growing and developing. You may not be ready to talk about it or act on it.  This may also represent the birth of a new idea, direction, project or goal.     To dream that you are pregnant with the baby dying inside of you, suggests that a project you had put a lot of effort into is falling apart and slowly deteriorating. Nothing is working out the way you want it to.      If you are really pregnant and having this dream, then it represents your anxieties about the pregnancy.  Women in the first  trimester of their pregnancy tend to dream of tiny creatures, fuzzy animals, flowers, fruit and water. In the second trimester, dreams will reflect your anxieties about being a good mother and concerns about possible complications with the birth. Dreams of giving birth to a non-human baby are also common during this period of the pregnancy. Finally, in the third trimester, dreams consists of your own mother. As your body changes and grows, dreams of whales, elephants and dinosaurs and other larger animals may also start appearing at this stage.|`|6YvkP2sGaa	Most dreams can't be taken literally.  Think of what pregnancy means to you, or what else it can mean.  Maybe your maternal instincts are showing up, or maybe you have a project due at school and you have  or need a good idea for it.|`|40HpQquSaa	maybe you aresubconiously thinking about sex. i know how it is.im thesame age and some times i have the same dreams.|`|j2sxi6Gvaa	The first time, it just means that you were thinking about it somewhere in your mind, maybe even subconsciously. The rest of the times are just because you were thinking about it the first time.|`|5tJ3DLJUaa	I also have pregnant dreams quite frequently, right around the time my period hits. If yours hasn't hit yet, it could just mean that it's coming.    It could also be that you just think about pregnancy a lot.|`|hyo4tWv9aa	a person has many dreams at night and you can only remember the one u had most recent so u might be having  more weirder and scarier dreams but u cant remember so the preganet dream is the most recent one . so stop thinking about it , and it might be a sign from ur body dat ur ready but ur not dat stupid getting preganet now. so dont get scared about it and i can gurantee u . u wont have them|`|OGS7Zdzjaa	oo the same thing happened to me last night.. except it was happy and i had 4 other best friends(who i have never seen before) having the baby on the same day. i looked it up and it said the start of something new or someting like that.. or someone eles can be pregnant.. idontknow but im pretty sure im not prego. haa
IaWlzcNsaa	People are and will continue to look for less expensive ways to purchase almost everything.  This includes everywhere that one can find a bargain.<br>  Thrift stores, discount stores and the internet will all provide alternatives where people can obtain goods without paying the prices that now seem less affordable.<br>  <br>  The internet is here to stay and I predict that it will have a greater role in the transformation of society and will provide a growing alternative towards sustaining people during economic hardship.
Xcri5qeTaa	Fire is passion which threatens to burn out of control, and the backyard is the semi private place where we keep things hidden.<br>  <br>  An emergency phone call is connecting with your subconscious, and can be a cry for help. Needing advice and guidance. Feeling anger in the dream is feeling angry over juvenile attitude in your life; either your own inability to be "grown up," actual interaction with someone who may have mocked your feelings, or fear of being mocked.<br>  <br>  Your feelings about the guy you like is almost certainly the subject of this and other dreams, and his car being untouched suggests you're waiting for him to make a move, but for now, things are kind of just sitting around waiting to happen.|`|IkgyyPtYaa	There is no such thing as telling someone what their dream means.

We're just too stupid to get it, apparently. And then there's "You are a feminist and just don't know it yet!" That always reminds me of a guy telling his girlfriend that she wants to sleep with him and just doesn't know it yet, while he tries to force himself on her.|`|7LSonIoraa	the dictionary definition of feminism is dead. Because feminist have proven to the world that they don't want equality. If feminism is about equal right then that mean they should care about what happen to boys feminist have no problem about the crisis that boys are going through being drugged up with ritalin and the suicide rate that going on infact they have welcome it because they see it has they ultimate victory.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	If you go by the dictionary definition of feminism, most women believe it.

Most often I disagree with what they have to say.<br>  <br>  I am a woman.<br>  <br>  It's ridiculous to assume that all people will agree just because they are the same gender.

eBMKmgCjaa	"How will it change things about when people can change sexes fairly quickly and cheaply? What about when they change to sexes that don't naturally occur?"  That will be a pretty wild party!    "Far more satisfying sex toys"  Women are already happy doing if for themselves. Feminists have been telling men for 40 years they should go **** themselves, and they may get their wish soon enough.    "Better cosmetics/appearance-altering methodologies. (What happens when no one's "more beautiful", but people appear as they want to, making beauty entirely a matter of opinion?"  That would be great. We could judge each other on personality more easily.     "Artificial wombs. (What happens when child birth can occur without needing a partner, for both men and women and other gender?)"  I think the women of today who take it for granted that they can treat men however their mood takes them, will suddenly find that life is a lot lonelier.|`|amUIknZRaa	I think they should just leave it alone.  There is enough gender confusion.|`|omYoOmSlaa	I'm not sure I agree with your opinion that sex-robots would result in less rape and one-night-stands. A sex-robot is not going to please a man whose aim is to scare a woman by forcing himself upon her. His intense thrill often comes from the fear that he's induced upon the woman.     One night stands might be impacted, but I highly doubt it. While a sex robot may look and feel human, the human knows that they are a machine which may make some people ashamed just to have one - much less use it.    Gender conversion may become physically easier, but I have a tough time seeing that it would be any easier psychologically. Those who do make changes now are allowed after a decent amount of time, education, and counseling. That wouldn't change. It might result in a higher demand for psychologists who've specialized in gender issues, and it wouldn't be a problem filling the need.    It's difficult for me to imagine life on Earth in 20 years - I certainly can't conceptualize what human life will be in 100 years. Kind of a scary thought ;o|`|6H1ie8WXaa	Well, we all know that the ultimate feminist conspiracy is to destroy gender completely and have a whole generation of 'boys' and 'girls' growing up not knowing if they're technically male or female. If it gets to that stage, we're going to have to have another sex revolution, this time with a completely different meaning.

Optimism has been shown to be correlated with better immune systems in healthy people who have been subjected to stress.

But optimism can be learned - The second article below will tell you more about it
mOVWQyyyaa	I have done it so many times!!!  Once I had a short dream, (like you said) about seeing this weird colorful ball sitting next to a water fountain, I had never seen it before, and when I woke up I didn't remember it. But the next day, I went to this open house thing at school the day before school started, and I went into my new class room, ( that I also hadn't been before) and on the water fountain, there was the colorful ball just like in my dream!! I was like, " Mom! Daja Vu!"    Some people say you have like a "vision" in your dream about something about to follow in your life. You have a lot, (and they are sometimes very unimportant) but you only remember the things that really happen, for example, if i hadn't gone to the open house thing, I wouldn't remember my dream. Also it could have something to do with another thing that was similar and happened before, but not always.    Creepy huh?|`|AA10510845	Deja-vu is actually the feeling that you have experienced something or been somewhere before.  There is something familiar about the experience, but often times you can't remember the exact details.  I don't know if your dream would qualify as deja-vu.  That may just be a coincidence.|`|0YQRbq9faa	Your temperament is dominant intuition.  You are very intuitive.  You focus on patterns and read between the lines in conversations and life in general.  When you recognize a familiar pattern or similarity between things, you have an ah-ha moment or deja-vu.  But it is based on your observations of the patterns of life.  That is just the preferred way that your mind and senses experience the world.    I have this frequently.  When I think about someone that I have not seen or spoke with in a while, I see them out in public or they call me.  I can sometimes predict small little things because I recognize the patterns of events.|`|AA11239733	This is deja vu....  This is deja vu....  This is deja vu....  This is deja vu....  This is deja vu....  This is deja vu....  This is deja vu....  This is deja vu....|`|3nrax9Hzaa	yeah that is deja vu.Deja Vu-feels like somethin happened b4. trust me i had deja vu so many times it keeps happenin over and over again probaly 2 yrs later sumthin that you dreamed or saw is going to happen to you so keep remembering your dreams in the future hope i helped:)|`|ccded6c1859c9ef04f029c1502be58d9aa	Yes, you spelt Deja Vu correctly =)    Deja vu is believed to be caused by a 'malfunction' in the brain. If you smell,see,taste,feel something somewhat familiar, your brain might search for a match, to find where/why this feeling is familiar. In the process there becomes a confusion. Your brain will say "yes,this smell IS familiar, and i have smelt it before" but your brain is confused and starts to believe that the whole situation is familiar,not just the one sense. That is one possible explanation.    Or if you get a deja vu, and are able to predict what happens next that is a  'precognitive experience'. Ive never had deja vu alone, it has always been a precognitive experience. I am able somehow?? to predict a couple of seconds into the future. I have predicted when the phone would ring or when a car would pull into the driveway and I am not sure how the brain is behaving when that happens, deja vu and precognitive experiences are  not very well researched.|`|bC2EgShAaa	Some people say, that if you're experiencing Dj Vu, it usually means you're on the right track, or following faith according planned.
H2oCXK35aa	I don't have any religion , don't go to church. But i do believe there is a God. My dreams is what keeps me going.|`|c9ZqOAk4aa	I believe that dreams unlock subconscious thoughts and desires, I'm agnostic/apathetic.|`|a8a441aa6973c0e73348e618806e0c1faa	sikh
jzCRB9Afaa	Yes!!! In a clinical setting it can be very helpful in treating anxiety...which may be a cause of your shyness. It teaches you how to relax and stay calm and in a way it almost helps you think of anxiety as being something that's kind of stupid to experience. It's also a lot safer than some of the drugs they'd give you for treating anxiety, such as xanax or valium because it's not something that's dangerous to become addicted to. However, not everyone's immediately hypnotizable, but if you have a good therapist they'll get you to a hypnotizable point. So yeah, definitely do it! Good Luck!!!
vAdtlZDpaa	The meaning of Hitler in your dream depends upon what Hitler means to you in real life, but your dream was about feeling threatened - probably emotionally, not physically - in your waking life. <br>  <br>  To dream that you are going downstairs signifies facing many setback in your endeavors.<br>  <br>  To dream that you are hiding suggests that you are keeping some secret or withholding some information. You may not be facing up to a situation or not want to deal with an issue. However, you may be getting ready to reveal and confess before somebody finds out. <br>  <br>  The washing machine could be a symbol for a mechanical lifestyle - going about your way without much thought and making decisions without thinking it through. Although, washing indicates a need to cleanse and purify yourself emotionally.|`|7fa0FWu2aa	JESUS WANTS TO FORGIVE THE THINGS YOU HAVE DONE WRONG.  HE WOULD EVEN HAVE FORGIVEN HITLER.

srIMFTb8aa	So we can fondle each others' breasts.|`|wkjncmHTaa	So they can put their make-up on, gossip and take drugs together. I've never understood it myself, I'd much rather be talking out in the bar than a bathroom and I don't have the compulsive need to reapply my mascara every half hour. *Shrugs*|`|3862H0WVaa	I don't know cause I am male. However I like the fondling breast answer.|`|6H1ie8WXaa	They have secret conspiracy meetings in there. Ever wondered why girls scream if you go into their bathroom (accidently)? Well there's your reason. Guys don't go into the bathroom in groups because that's, kinda weird.|`|FNvv74UQaa	Guys don't go in groups because it breaks a cardinal rule of bathroom etiquette. Women go to the bathroom in groups because they're allowed to talk to each other in the can, so they go there  to talk about us in privacy.|`|AA11530601	honestly its just so we can chat.........cause at the girls room there is usally ample time for conversation since there is a mirror that ppl crowd around doing their makup. There isnt reallymuch reason why any guy would want to stay in the bathroom longer than necessary since they arent gonna stand around putting on makeup, and so its not a social event ;]|`|AXNowGPyaa	This is one of the simplest questions out there. Women go to the bathroom in groups because they like to go blab with each other about stuff. Men don't, because that would be gay, whereas women don't worry about being perceived as gay, and getting away to confab with their girlfriend is crucial. The only time I have ever had a conversation with a dude in the bathroom was when a very important sporting event was being broadcast in the bar.    edit: seriously dude. has no woman ever filled you in on the kind of chit-chat that goes on there?    edit: Alex K--way to go giving some extra points for some extra drug dealing tips, because that is a bathroom aspect we never considered. I have certainly overpayed for "dank" and still been happy with the transaction.

That's when we say, "He's SO cute!" or "I think I'm a little drunk" and laugh away. Then, one might bring up a self-negativity, and we all support her. "No, you're not fat! or "You're so pretty!" or "I love that outfit on you, it looks great!"    It's just a time to share our thoughts about the man or situation. I recall that we also discuss just how interested we are in going further with our date. That's about it.    I would imagine why men never go in groups is because they have a different manner around each other. How many men tell each other that they're good looking, slim, or dress well? Not many! LOL :D|`|ed2Zmw2aaa	i a dude only time, we say sh T in restroom ,.is hi, or whats up, and thats in school, or sometimes, once i sold a kid 1 gram of dank for 30 bucks, i ripped him off, but he loved it so much..anyhow never sell or slang bud in school its dumb, out of school way less sketchy
AA11530601	its not like some magic process whereby they just send out secret signals to meet other abusers or victims. Its just that when they meet ppl who are potential abusers, because they are familiar with that pattern, alarm bells dont ring in their minds  and what would actually repel other people seems normal to them, its what has been put into their semi-sub-conscious mind and it just "feels normal" to them. So they carry on seeing abusers when others would not, they give them chances and 2nd chances that they dont deserve.   The theory u are talking about rests on the idea of  a "subconscious script" that we develop in early years, up until about late teen years but mostly in childhood whereby we think "this is the way life IS" and when we meet others who completely by chance fit that script (e.g. they act in ways that remind us of our 1st boyfriend or our mum or dad) we feel at ease with them because they seem to be able to act the lines of our "play" = they way we expect things to work out subconsciously,|`|trMsK86jaa	When i make a point of being open and friendly, mostly users.

You blew it when you didn't call and your BF grabbed the phone. If you don't like your BF why are you living with him? Move on and out. Maybe if he sees you being responsible and not jumping into one relationship after another it may just work.|`|AA11530601	Even if the new guy dosent want to be with you, you shouldnt be with ur old boyfriend if you dont like him. I have done that and belive me you ALWAYS regret it. If you had dumped him ages ago like you wanted to, none of this crap with your new guy would have happened. But if hes willing to dump you over one missed call then hes not worth keeping anyway. I do think it sounds like you have a chance again but id wait a bit before asking him again.|`|MWrwnHM2aa	He's obviously hurt because of the insults your boyfriend pulled.   Talk to your boyfriend about your relationship and that you have grown apart. If you are willing to dump your boyfriend for this new guy then do it.  Also, talk to this new guy about you two together and try to keep in touch. Don't ignore your ex boyfriend after you have dumped him because he may get hasty and depressed that you haven't kept in contact.   Your ex boyfriend maybe willing to support you through your relationship between this new guy and will also lighten up you abit.    Keep in touch with both of these guys and keep them in your life because it's better to have a friend then no friend.   If you see him through out the day at work then make a small conversation with him, then build it up and talk at lunch time.  Tell him that it never worked out with your ex.

LcLGnTVMaa	Don't worry about it! Why do today, what you can put off until tomorrow. Kidding of course, I have the same problem and have not found an easy answer. You just gotta get off your butt and take care of stuff. Good work habits are something you have to teach yourself, its not a skill you were born with. I may sound a little preachy, but it all comes down to self disipline. You need to hold yourself to a higher standard and put into practice all the things you know that you need to improve upon.|`|DEMQR8piaa	Haha... exactly what I'm doing. :)    "Procrastination... leaders of tomorrow"    It's all about time management. Break the habit by finding a really quiet place to do your HW (your room, library, local cafe, park, etc) and I know this sounds ridiculous, but keep a timer at hand. Give yourself 30 min to do your homework, then a 5-10 minute break according to how much you have. As much as you don't want to do it, if you keep focused, you'll get it done so much faster!    Hope this helped :) and good luck!|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	I don't know. I get so stressed out thinking about the things I haven't done yet, I find it much more pleasant in the long run just to do them right away so I can stop worrying. It makes me much happier overall.

Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.|`|AA11216736	DONT ******* GIVE UP KEEP LOOKIN FOR A JOB AND TRY TO BE AS POSITIVE AS YOU CAN.

AXNowGPyaa	Well, you could do worse than to quote Ben Franklin "Early to bed, early to rise/makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise." I've never been wealthy, but I can certainly attest to the other two. A good, sensible sleep pattern is the best thing you can do to promote a healthy lifestyle. Unless you are an artist or phone sex operator, you are doing nothing valuable once the bars close.      The morning is the best part of the day. You are missing out on the Universe's best energies by staying in bed until 3 or 4 in the afternoon. I can't emphasize this strongly enough. There have been years long periods in my life when I never was in bed later than 8 or 9 in the morning, and I usually rise sometime between 4 and 7. That's when the world comes alive.    Being up for dawn has its own special niceness. There's a great song in the musical "Guys and Dolls" where the gangster dude is explaining to the church chick how the early morning hour are his time of the day. I can relate. I have closed down more than my share of bars and welcomed many a sunrise with many a stimulating companion. But I have never felt more at east than when waking up before the sky was light, where to milk cows or meditate on my third chakra.     If you are a youngster, don't worry too much about this. You have to find your won body's rhythms. But keep in mind--the natural rhythm of the universe is that living things be up and moving when the sun starts to hit the planet.|`|9a8dcc5b6d79b07abd75628d8b093129aa	I have the same problem..

(maybe 9 if your really pushing)|`|TK4Tj9FPaa	I have kinda the same schedule of sleep. I just find that there's alot more interesting tv shows on at night, and if I can sleep in I'll almost always do it. As far as getting motivated, you just have to force yourself to get up and be active.

Hours are long, money is terrible, and the "success" are far and few in between. Not b/c of you, but many circumstances present themselves.What can you do? Well, you might not like this answer b/c I'm sure you're probably looking for something "psych", but I would seriously recommend this: Start by researching the different degrees. You can go through FOUR years of college and come out with a degree that won't allow you to be paid by insurance companies. If your not being paid by insurance, then it is usually self pay and people just don't, won't or can't put out that kind of money. Face the fact that you will NEED to be paid. Next I would browse (this will be more fun),through colleges and the courses for each degree. Look at the different types of degrees. Find out just how much each college will cost. In order to be a psychologist, you'll need a Master+ So, find out how much time this will take. And how will you finance it. Finally, allow yourself to change your mind. As you are researching, you just may happen upon some other field or profession in human services that sounds interesting. Look ! Allow yourself to browse. You have time. I think its wonderful that you have dreams about your career and I don't think it's silly to want to investigate. But first things first. Know what your getting into, with a SOLID foundation, (meaning know the facts of what it will take) rather than a pie in the sky..."when I grow up,I wanna be a..." Once you know the facts of what will be expected of you, people will take you seriously b/c you will be armed with facts, Knowing what it's gonna take will display your serious intent. But I gotta say it one more time, ALLOW yourself to change your mind if at some point you find interest in something else. Good luck and don't get discouraged. There is a career out there waiting just for you!|`|AA10015960	A psychologist plays a major roll in society, but most people do not think about it because they are the ones who have to do the dirty work. A psychologist watches a client that has been sent to them.  They watch their every move to decide if they have a mental problem. They create plans for what kind of therapy they are going to go through whether they will be Behavioral Therapy (This treatment is used to change the attitude and behavior of the patient by giving rewards for being good, reinforcements, desensitization), Biomedical Treatment (This treatment is when they only use medication and maybe some psycho therapy to treat emotion and mental illnesses), Cognitive Therapy (This treatment is used to change the way the patient thinks by getting rid of beliefs that make them depressed or angry), Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy (This treatment is the mix of both cognitive therapy and behavior therapy), Couples Counseling and Family Therapy (This treatment helps families and couples come closer together by having group and sometimes even individual sessions), Electroconvulsive Therapy (This life saving technique is only used at the last resort when someone is likely to commit suicide, cant take medicine, has major depression, and many others), Group Therapy (In group therapy there is about four to twelve people in it that discuss each others problems to each other and so they will get some positive feed back that can help all members), Interpersonal Psychotherapy (This treatment is used for individuals who meet with therapists one on one and discuss there current life and relationships and how to fix it), Light Therapy (This treatment is very unknown but is very affective. "Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a form of depression that appears related to fluctuations in the exposure to natural light. It usually strikes during autumn and often continues through the winter when natural light is reduced. Researchers have found that people who have SAD can be helped with the symptoms of their illness if they spend blocks of time bathed in light from a special full-spectrum light source, called a "light box."), Play Therapy ("Geared toward young children, this technique uses a variety of activities-such as painting, puppets, and dioramas-to establish communication with the therapist and resolve problems. Play allows the child to express emotions and problems that would be too difficult to discuss with another person."), Psychoanalysis or Psychodynamic Psychotherapy ("This approach focuses on past conflicts as the underpinnings to current emotional and behavioral problems. In this long-term and intensive therapy, an individual meets with a psychoanalyst three to five times a week, using "free association" to explore unconscious motivations and earlier, unproductive patterns of resolving issues."). After the psychologists client has been through a little of the therapy the psychologist may change or modify the first plan to better help his client. Psychologists also have their clients take tests that they will interpret so they can better understand the client and what their needs are. A psychologist does therapy with groups of people as well as individual clients to help them define goals, gain insight, and ways they can help themselves when they are not in therapy. For instance, the therapist will say to read a good book, run, exercise, dance, and many other things so they will not feel depressed, angry, confused, and with any other problems. There are different levels to mental health and the higher you go the more you do. Counseling is the first step. They help an individual make the right choices and resolve problems. The second step the therapist helps a patient who is dealing with mental disorders like depression or family problems. A psychologist in a way does all of those things plus mentoring a watching. The highest is a psychiatrist that can do everything plus prescribe medicines which a psychologist can not do even though they are a licensed doctor.

First question: Are some people just born that way?    No one knows.    All I can really do is sum up and point you towards the 'nature versus nurture' debate. This debate consists of two arguments:    A) People are born with prior knowledge and are mentally preconditioned towards certain things (Nature). This includes being naturally talented or musical, and increased likelihood of becoming addicted to something, or even being naturally aggressive - or, as you've put it, 'mean'. :P    B) People have no prior knowledge, and the way they act is entirely conditioned by the environment and the people they are brought up by and in, otherwise referred to as Tabula rasa (Nurture).    As I said, no one really knows. People are misled, and misleading facts and figures have swayed people in one direction or the other, but there hasn't been enough evidence for either argument. Social experiments have been performed in the past, often with twins, but nothing conclusive has arisen so far.|`|Tbhmsrlsaa	People are not inherently "mean" they are taught to be mean by childhood experiences and that sort of thing yes.

If you are worried about raising your daughter to be the best she can be then just know that a mother who actually takes the time to make sure she is doing her best will be the best up bringing your daughter could have.  Yes, you will make mistakes, but be quick to apologize or make things right.  It's good for your children to see that even adults make mistakes and they need to see you be quick to make it right, not pretend that you can mess up and it's supposed to be accepted.
