GCBv0zkoaa	Grow up and stop wasting time and space here....|`|2b7ErdOqaa	You can tenderize the steak just fine with a two-prong fork.  Season it, start stabbing it with the fork all over, and then cook it.  Remember, making it come out tender has to do with the heat - very high heat will cause the muscles in the meat to tighten - thus making tough meat.  Slow cooking makes the muscles relax.  When I cook a steak, I put it on a metal tray and set the oven at 400o.  I cook it 10 minutes on each side and then set the broiler for 2 minutes at the most to crisp up the fat - done!!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

AA11173395	1.  If you're underweight, eat more calories.  If you're anemic, eat more iron rich foods (beans, whole grains, green leafy vegetables) with a glass of oj to increase absorption.<br>  And most doctors never took a single course in nutrition.  It isn't a requirement in medical school.<br>  Do your own research, and decide for yourself:<br>  <a href="http://www.pcrm.org/health/veginfo/vsk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcrm.org/health/veginfo/vsk/</a><br>  <br>  2.  Craving something doesn't mean you have to consume it.  That a wonderful thing about being human.  Generally, when people experience what they call "cravings" for protein, it's because they aren't consuming enough fat.  Have a few spoonfuls of peanut butter, or half an avocado.<br>  <br>  3.  After a year and a half, your parents are used to your diet.<br>  <br>  You don't "need" to eat meat.|`|6Gfz125Paa	I suggest you:<br>  <br>  1.  get a new doctor.  Most medical professionals agree that vegetarianism, if done correctly, is healthy.  There are other sources of iron you can get, like some types of vegetables, or a supplement if all else fails.<br>  <br>  2.  don't worry about that.  Cravings are natural.  It's OK to "cheat" and eat meat once in a way, but don't use that as an excuse.<br>  <br>  3.  I don't see why they would need to buy extra food.  You can just eat what they eat but leave out the meat.  Meat is more expensive anyway, so you're probably saving them money.|`|2RzEaod9aa	1. Anemia is caused by low iron, and being underweight is caused by a lack of proper levels of food. Basically, you are anemic and underweight because you eat like sh*t, not because you're a vegetarian. Remember: omnivores can be anemic and underweight, too. You being a vegetarian has nothing to do with it. I'm a vegan and because I lift weights, I'm actually heavier than other women my height, and I'm also not anemic despite the fact that I don't get any meat. Remember, leafy greens, beans, and nuts are all great sources of iron; for example, 1oz of spinach has DOUBLE the iron than 1oz of beef. <br>  <br>  You must also consider the fact that the average American doctor receives approximately THREE HOURS of nutrition training throughout his/her entire schooling. Nutritionists and general practitioners are completely different. Or perhaps your doctor thinks she knows better than the Mayo Clinic and the American Heart Association?<br>  Mayo Clinic: <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vegetarian-diet/HQ01596" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vegetar...</a><br>  AHA: <a href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4777" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.j...</a><br>  <br>  Hell, the Mayo Clinic even has a vegetarian food pyramid for you to follow: <a href="http://vegetarius.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/fn7_vegetarian.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://vegetarius.files.wordpress.com/20...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  2. You crave bacon because there's something in it that your body is asking for but you are not giving to it. Becoming vegan destroyed all my cravings because I have such a balanced diet now. Not only do I not crave meat, dairy, or eggs, but I also don't crave sweets, salty treats, etc., unless my diet was hectic that day. As long as I'm in balance, I crave nothing.<br>  <br>  3. Don't feel guilty about that. Kids require so much money. If you really feel bad, then don't ask for extras like MP3 players or new shoes that you want just to have them. <br>  <br>  <br>  You do not need to eat meat, you need to eat correctly. If eating meat magically made you healthy, then:<br>  No omnivore would be overweight.<br>  No omnivore would be diabetic.<br>  No omnivore would be anemic.<br>  No omnivore would be underweight. <br>  <br>  You need to see a nutritionist.|`|3k2oIlPWaa	Sometimes you have to do what you have to do.<br>  <br>  Just eat a healthy portion/what's recommended, you need to be healthy.  You're anemic, you know you need it.  It's not like your simply insisting you must have it to survive just because it 'tastes good'|`|2zHq2XIMaa	First of all do not feel guilty. Guilt isn't good for you. It's ok, your doing the best you think you can.<br>  <br>  I'm going to tell you what I think.<br>  <br>  I think your doctor is highly uneducated if she is "against" teenagers eating a healthy vegetarian diet. She must not know much about food, wouldn't surprise me, as most doctors recieve less that 4 hours of nutritional training throughout their whole schooling as doctors. <br>  Maybe your doc can sort you out for a cold or virus but I'd listen to the nutritionists and healthy vegetarians/vegans out there for advice on diet.<br>  <br>  Ok, you say you are anemic and underweight. This isn't healthy, but there are a lot of people anemic and underweight who are omnivores also. This isn't to be put down to you eating a vegetarian diet, it is simply that you are not getting enough iron and nutrition for your age.<br>  <br>  Try some of the following foods which are suitable for vegetarians:<br>  <br>  Quiona - An ancient "grain" which is generally boiled in water like rice or pasta or cous cous and is a great alternative to these foods. It is full of calcium and protein.<br>  <br>  Tofu - Full of calcium, protein, and fortified with vitamin B12. <br>  <br>  Dark green leafy vegetables - (Spinach, broccoli, kale, cabbage etc.) High in Iron and calcium. <br>  <br>  Eggs - Contain Iron and protein<br>  <br>  Nuts and seeds - Full of good fats, and protein. Eat in moderation.<br>  <br>  Beans, grains and pulses - kidney beans are full of iron and protein. Lentils and chickpeas and other beans are fab too.<br>  <br>  Lots of fresh fruit and vegetables - Contain antioxidants, essential vitamins and minerals.<br>  <br>  If you are vegetarian you can eat cheese too!<br>  <br>  You also mention that you feel you are a burden to your parents as you are causing them to buy "extra food".<br>  <br>  This is not true, you are not a burden, you are simply health concious and compassionate. <br>  As a vegetarian, you can eat many foods that meat eater can - I'm sure your family drinks milk and eats pastas and cereals and rice and pasta and broccoli and lots of other fresh fruit and vegetables, if they don't they need to start buying them anyway!<br>  Also, vegetarian alternatives such as TVP and quorn are inexpensive, especially in comparison to meat. Ask your family to try some of them out.<br>  <br>  <br>  You say you are "craving" bacon - You are likely craving salt - something which bacon is full of - try tamari(wheat free soy sauce) or regular soy sauce, or nutritonal yeast flakes like fake parmesan cheese or sun dried tomatoes. <br>  <br>  Please don't be disheartened so early on and return to an omni diet, your health IS important, and you CAN and WILL be healthy on a vegetarian diet.<br>  <br>  With the information I have given you, you should be able to talk to your parents and ask them to help you.<br>  <br>  Here are some helpful websites: <br>  <br>  Veganoutreach,com<br>  Thevegetariansociety.com|`|kAfZaLwraa	First of all, you CAN be a vegetarian. It is entirely possible. <br>  <br>  1. Being underweight and anemic is a dietary issue, yes, but it's entirely possible to be totally healthy on a vegetarian diet, just like a meat-eater can be underweight and anemic. <br>  <br>  2. If your only pervasive craving for meat is for bacon, then it is simply a flavor/texture craving. You shouldn't take it as an indication that you "need" meat anymore than someone who has crazy ice cream cravings "needs" milk. It tastes good, you want it. You don't need it. Facon isn't all that great. <br>  <br>  3. The only way it will cost extra is if you require designer fake meats. If you eat whole foods, your diet will definitely be cheaper. Legumes are cheaper than meat. Unless your family has a very unhealthy diet (where their only source of protein is meat), they likely won't need to buy anything extra for you. Low-fat dairy, whole grain bread, and legumes (all of which your whole family should be consuming on a daily basis) will cover it. As for iron, again, legumes and dark leafy greens (which your family should be eating) should do it. Just make sure you get some vitamin C along with it to help you absorb the non-heme iron. <br>  <br>  In short, start thinking about these reasons as excuses and you'll see that you really don't need to start eating meat at all. You CAN be a vegetarian! It is entirely possible for you to overcome the pressure coming from outside and within if you look at it logically and make a plan. <br>  <br>  That being said, if you really want to stop being vegetarian and eating meat, accept that. You're allowed to change your mind. Just do your best to choose meats that most closely align with your ethics. Went vegetarian for the environment? Buy local and pasture-raised. For ethics? Again, pasture-raised organic. Keep in mind, however, that this will DEFINITELY increase the financial burden on your family. <br>  <br>  Basically, don't make excuses and don't justify your choice to strangers. The only person who needs to be okay with this decision is you. Either you are or you're not. If you are, make the choice. If you're not, choose to stay vegetarian. I apologize if I sound harsh, but it really is that simple.|`|US33hgbJaa	Ask your parents if the expense of cruelty free meat for the whole family is comparable to buying you vegetarian food along with meat for the family.|`|OcIYgqtyaa	try free range meat. I was almost vegan and switched back not too long ago. Now i only buy free range products....much better<br>  <br>  good luck!!!<br>  <br>  :)|`|AA11124473	I was a vegan teenager, too. I also became anemic. I was able to change my diet and add supplements, and I got healthy without eating meat or dairy. I didn't suffer any long-term ill effects. My doctor never suggested that I eat meat (though she did ask me to eat eggs...even though I didn't follow that advice, I got better). It makes me nervous that your doctor thinks teenagers shouldn't be vegetarians, because I have known many healthy vegetarian and vegan teens, and I was one myself once I started eating right! I've been a vegetarian all my life, and my mom became a vegetarian back when she was a teenager, too. I also had lots of vegetarian friends as a teenager, and none of my friends had any known nutritional deficiencies. <br>  <br>  If I were in your situation, I would get a second opinion. Many doctors don't know a lot about nutrition, and I speak from experience when I say that a teenager can be healthy and vegetarian at the same time. It sounds like you eat dairy and eggs, too, which means that you have an even larger selection of foods to choose from than I did when I was anemic. There are many, many vegetarian sources of iron, fat, and protein, which are what you need to combat anemia and put on a few healthy pounds.<br>  <br>  If you'd like some high iron and high protein vegetarian recipes, you can look online or let me know...I have some.<br>  <br>  If you do decide to eat meat, introduce small portions and be selective about it: only eat very iron rich meats and buy free range meat. And add a bit of fish, since it can help you absorb iron.<br>  <br>  There are also vegetarian foods that help you absorb iron, like citrus fruits, broccoli, potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers, or anything with lots of vitamin c.|`|Gem96NQyaa	Probably a large part of the reason you're craving bacon is because you're anemic.  The body naturally craves what it lacks.<br>  <br>  Teens can manage just fine on veg diets, BUT they really need to know what they're doing.  Cutting out an entire food group (or two, if you're vegan) means that you're missing out on a lot of very essential nutrients.  The fact that you've said you're underweight and anemic tells me that you probably had very little guidance in terms of supplemental nutrients and vitamins.<br>  <br>  If you can't put together a nutritionally balanced vegetarian diet, either on your own or with the help of a nutritionist, you shouldn't be eating one.<br>  <br>  As far as what you should do... I suppose my question is do you object to eating meat because it was alive, or do you object to it because of the horrible conditions many food animals are forced to endure?  If the latter, there are many brands that use humane slaughter methods, and organically-raised, free range meats are also an option in that regard.  If the former, you may want to consider a visit to a nutritionist who can put together a proper veg diet for someone your age.|`|u6cFXfPnaa	You can absolutely be a healthy vegetarian. What are you eating now? Please do some research on the subject and find what nutrients you may be lacking. Your anemia can be solved by eating high iron vegetarian foods. Good sources are kidney beans, other beans/legumes, molasses, dried fruit, and leafy green vegetables. When you eat these foods, make sure you get vitamin C at the same meal (through foods, not supplementation) by eating a tangerine, having lemon in your water, or several strawberries for dessert. Also, caffeine and calcium inhibit absorption of iron, so do not have any dairy, coffee, or tea when you eat your iron-rich foods. In ADDITION to this you can take an iron supplement, but it is important that you get iron from your diet too. <br>  <br>  Make sure you are eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. If you need to put on weight, try eating 500 more calories a day than you are currently. That might be in the form of a banana and a handful of nuts. Make sure you are eating breakfast everyday. Snack throughout the day on healthy things like dried fruit, nuts, and whole grains. Do not eat too many refined carbs. <br>  <br>  You can do it if it is important to you. You just need to make some adjustments. Finding a doctor who can give you some tips on healthy vegetarian eating would be better than having one who is uneducated on the subject. The average doctor got 2.5 hours of nutrition training in all those years at med school, so they often really know nothing about what they are talking about. A nutritionist can give you better advice.

(If the beef is super lean, add a bit more butter).  When the butter is hot, add the beef.  Sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper (you want it pretty strong, as you'll be adding milk and flour) and add a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce.  <br>  <br>  While it's browning, put 2-3 heaping tablespoons of flour in a jar, with a little cold water.  Shake, until it is completely liquid.<br>  <br>  When the beef is browned, drain and return to heat.  Add enough milk to cover the beef, plus about 1/2 inch.  Add your flour mixture, and bring to a boil, stirring constantly.  When it begins boiling, it should already be thickening.  Keep stirring until you reach the desired thickness.  I usually use more flour than I need, so I can cut it with milk if I have to.  It's easier than adding flour again.

f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	After you've eaten your fair share of grilled chicken breast, you realize there's a thin line between done and dry... and once it's crossed, there's no going back. <br>  Sometimes the problem is too high heat or trying to cook too fast.<br>  First of all, there are two basic methods for cooking: dry heat and moist heat. Dry heat methods include baking, roasting, grilling, sauteeing, and deep frying. Moist heat methods include microwaving, poaching, baking in parchment, steaming, and slow cooking. This is the rule: when cooking chicken breasts with dry heat, use high heat and cook for a short period of time. When using moist heat, use low heat and cook for a longer period of time. Now when I say longer, that doesn't mean hours. Grilled chicken breasts cook in 8-10 minutes, while poached breasts cook in about 15 minutes. And here's another tip: when cooking with dry heat, pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness so they will cook evenly. <br>  Chicken should be cooked to a temperature of 165 degrees F.<br>  Remember that the meat will continue to cook after it's removed from the heat; the internal temperature will rise about 5-10 degrees in the first few minutes it's off the heat. So let it rest.|`|4fGQO9bVaa	at work we do it in chicken broth thats watered down and after half an hour you flip the chicken breasts over to soak the other side of them for another half hour. dont get that salty broth get the good stuff at the health food store. each time you put the whole load of breasts in there put them in the oven at 350 degrees for thirty mins. Enjoy!!|`|bspRfskYaa	i get the chicken add one spray of 1 cal spray oil add some peppers and onions then wrap in foil and put into the oven. this way the chicken cooks in its own juices and stays lovely and moist.|`|VHRhShyJaa	Try poaching it or stewing it in a very flavorful cooking liquid of stock, wine and spices.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	If your chicken is dry, you've over-cooked it, plain and simple.  Get yourself a probe type oven thermometer, stick it in the thickest part of the meat and set it for 158-degrees.  When the alarm goes off, remove the chicken from the oven (but don't remove the probe!), tent it with aluminum foil, and wait for it to come up to 165-degrees.  Your chicken will be thoroughly cooked and safe to eat.  More important, it will be juicy and tender.<br>  If you see pink meat (especially near the joints) don't worry about it and don't be tempted to cook it longer.  The U.S.D.A. says this is caused by hemoglobin trapped in the meat, and is not an indication of done-ness.|`|kPNnfjNSaa	Marinate (or bread) and bake in the oven in a glass dish (covered with tin foil) for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees.
8Wqbz6FMaa	I make lettuce wraps all the time and this is how I prepare the leaves two hours before serving.  Clean the lettuce by discarding the outer torn leaves.  Cut the bottom core to loosen the leaves (you may have to cut the core a few more times to loosen the inner leaves).  Run the whole head of lettuce under running cold water with the core side up, the water will get in between the leaves and will separate the outer leaf one after the other, giving you nice whole leaves.  Cut the leaves into bowls and place them inside a big tupperware bowl (with lid) lined with moist towel.  Cover the leaves with moist paper towel on top, then put the lid on.  Store in the fridge until serving time.|`|YQTBQ5xyaa	P.F. Chang's makes their lettuce wraps to order.  That way, the lettuce is still crisp by the time it gets to the table.

EMDNVrcjaa	Sugar-on-Snow<br>  <br>  This delicacy has been a traditional spring-time favorite at sugar houses and sugar camps for over 200 years. In some areas of the maple region, it is also known as "leather aprons" or "leather britches", due to its chewy, leathery consistency. Here in New England we know it as sugar-on-snow. A real New England Sugar Eat can easily be prepared at home.<br>  <br>  Ingredients: Maple Syrup, Pan of snow, Sour pickles, Saltines or plain doughnuts<br>  <br>  Heat maple syrup to 22 to 28 degrees F. above the boiling point of water. Usually heating to about 234 degrees will do the job. A higher heat will make a stiffer product. As soon as the syrup reaches the proper temperature, it is poured or drizzled immediately, without stirring, over packed snow or shaved ice. Because it cools so rapidly, the supersaturated solution does not have a chance to crystallize. It will form a thin glassy, chewy, taffy-like sheet over the snow. Twirl it up with a fork and enjoy! Traditionally it's served with sour pickles to cut the sweetness, and saltines or plain doughnuts.
YQTBQ5xyaa	The trick to bonless-skinless breasts is to cook them as quickly as possibel.  Yes, pounding them will help.  If you bake them, marinating them first will help.

I like to season with salt, pepper and garlic powder for a simple grilled chicken breast.  I also like to marinade chicken breast.  Here is my recipe for kabobs, but you can also use the marinade for whole chicken breast.  You really only need to cook them no more then 10 minutes, depending on how thick they are.  Another trick, let them rest at room temperature for 15 minutes before cooking.<br>  <br>  Greek Style Kabobs<br>  <br>  Marinade:<br>  1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil<br>  Zest 1/2 of a large lemon, then Juice<br>  1 large clove garlic, minced<br>  1 tsp dried oregano<br>  1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper<br>  1/4 tsp salt<br>  <br>  4 boneless chicken breast<br>  6 - 8 Metal or Bamboo Skewers<br>  <br>  Combine olive oil, lemon zest & juice, garlic,<br>  oregano, salt & pepper.

Thread 4 or 5 pieces<br>  of meat onto skewers, leaving a little space<br>  between each. (if using bamboo skewers, soak 30 minutes).<br>  <br>  Place on grill, cook for 2 minutes, turn and<br>  cook 2 minutes, turn again & cook for 2 minutes.<br>  Remove from grill, place on serving platter.<br>  <br>  Let rest a few minutes.

I wonder if the chicken that is sold boneless is already dried out from all the handling.|`|qNdsNhgOaa	Boiling usually tends to make the chicken a little tougher than you'd like.  For moist, tender chicken, try using a thermometer!  Chicken breast is cooked when the internal temperature is at 170 degrees.  The higher the internal temp is, the tougher it will be.  However, don't pull it out of the over before 170 because then you're at risk for food poisoning!  Best wishes ;)

Which is to say, everyone knows that if you drink a lot, you're apt to get cirrhosis of the liver or bleeding ulcers, but no one can point to a typical disease that afflicts old potheads.  Cannabis is also far less addictive (alcohol withdrawal can be life-threatening) and produces less physical impairment for a moderate intoxication. Alcohol seems to induce more violent and stupid behavior, too.|`|oojO4WAraa	It is illegal - so it is less safe in that regard.<br>  <br>  But alcohol makes people do stupid things, they lose control with alcohol.

The pot on the streets today has a THC level of 14 percent to 27 percent. With each hit off a bong or pipe, marijuana smokers inhale more than 150 cancer-causing substances and almost twice as much tar as they would from a tobacco cigarette. Other short-term side effects include short-term memory loss, impaired abstract thinking, and slower reaction time.<br>  <br>  Marijuana can be addictive:<br>  Many treatment centers around the country are treating patients who have a primary addiction to marijuana.

hjbjY5Skaa	I cut meat for a good 40+ hours a week and the actual sections used in the ground meat vary depending on what we need to cut for the day.  Some ground beef comes in coarse ground in round 60 pound boxes and we grind it into fine ground beef, i assume that pre-grinds us a similar process to what we use. .  When we can we grind the meat out of fresh parts, any part that you can cut good steaks/roasts out of is used as well as lifter when we don't have enough scrap.  Top Round, bottom round, Rib, Loin, Chuck, etc....  Any meat trimmed off of the final steaks is screened for bone fragments, organs, veins, and excess fat before we grind it.<br>  Organ grinds make delicious burgers if the organs are mixed properly.<br>  There is more to beef than just the muscle tissue, don't be afraid to try some of the less popular parts of animals, as long as you keep a clean kitchen and cook everything (raw meat may get you sick) you will be fine.|`|EMh3cD7Maa	In the USA, ground beef is usually labeled; ground sirloin, round, chuck, etc., or market grade, which could be a combination, but all good meat and fat, no fillers or scraps.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	If you want to be sure of what you are getting, select a steak or roast from the cooler and ask the butcher to grind it for you.  Fat is necessary, though.  I ground my own sirloin one time and left out all of the fat; it was the toughest burger I ever ate!|`|SLSX6QQsaa	It depends on the kind of ground beef you pick...like if its Chuck, Sirloin, etc.  If you get the kind special for making meatballs and stuff like that, its more likely to have high fat content and other scraps.  If you get Ground beef for burgers, etc. its normal, good meat. Of course you can get more expensive meat and it won't have as much fat.  In MI anyways, its illegal to put organs or other gross scraps in the meat.  Fat is allowed though.|`|kjgonYlgaa	Usually yes its the ends off of steaks and roasts and such, but not gross like hot dogs there's only good beef with very little extra fat put in.<br>  At some shops where th sales of ground beef are high and there are not enough cuts to take trim off then a wholepiecee of inexpensive beef(possibly blade) may be used instead of trim.|`|MmfMJq9Paa	Usually its trim from Chuck meat.|`|Z3wg4Z3daa	Udders, pouches, and claws.|`|8077a0fe445d32340f8fb7b694fc56e9aa	In many countries, food laws define specific categories of ground beef and what they can contain. For example, in the United States, beef fat may be added to hamburger, but not to ground beef if the meat is ground and packaged at a USDA-inspected plant. A maximum of 30% fat by weight is allowed in either hamburger or ground beef. Both hamburger and ground beef can have seasonings, but no water, phosphates, extenders, or binders added. Ground beef is often marketed in a range of different fat contents, to match the preferences of different customers.<br>  <br>  Ground beef is usually made from tougher meat and leftover meat created when the sides of beef are carved into steaks and roasts.About 17-18% of US ground beef comes from dairy cows.<br>  <br>  Although any cut of beef may be used, chuck steak is one of the most popular choices, due to its richness of flavor and balance of meat and fat. Round steak is also frequently used.|`|VHRhShyJaa	Usually sirloin or chuck and fat.

I would take it back if you don't like the taste of it but, I would just tell them it doesn't taste right, not that you think the frosting is wrong.|`|BtaS9XLMaa	I would read the label first to make sure you didnt buy one that does have buttercream as a frosting.  If it says cream cheese, then I would take it back. You paid for it, and you should get what you paid for .
4dntstR9aa	I would start with a business license. I would also apply for the tax licenses - you may not have to pay sales tax with this business but there will be employee taxes.  You would also need to check out Workmans comp insurance (which is never fun) But I look at it as precautionary Insurance - Can I afford to pay if someone slips at my business and breaks their leg in a compound fracture?  NO I wouldn't want to pay those hospital bills.  If you go straight to the State for the Workmans comp insurance, it is pretty inexpensive to start up.  It only goes up once there is a claim - mine has never gone up, just down.  Here in AZ I go through SCF (State compensation Fund) and they are reasonable.<br>   Then I would try and price out the insurance like your competitor said they have.  Don't settle for the first price of insurance you get - and when you do get a price, ask them if that is as low as they can cover you.  Sometimes (in fact always when I have priced out insurance for my business, they always seem to find a way to cut the price lower, when I question them)

AA11124473	There are a few reasons to choose one oil over another:<br>  a)flavor<br>  b)smoke point/high heat tolerance<br>  c)health benefits<br>  <br>  a) Olive oil has a nice olivey flavor that's great for salads or with any dish that would be well complimented by olives, like eggplant, chickpeas, some kinds of fish, and many other things. Sesame oil or toasted sesame oil adds great flavor to asian dishes. Truffle oil is great for pasta dishes and has an earthy flavor. Corn, safflower, and canola oils have a fairly neutral flavor and are good choices when you don't want the oil to interfere with the other flavors in your food.<br>  <br>  b) For high heat cooking, grapeseed oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, and avocado oil are good choices. For medium heat, olive oil works fine, though it will lose some of its flavor if you're making something that cooks slowly. Only use sesame oil with low heat, or mix a dash of it in with an oil that doesn't burn at high heat, as an earlier poster suggested.<br>  <br>  c) Because it is high in omega 3 essential fatty acids, flax seed oil is considered one of the healthiest oils. However, it spoils quickly and shouldn't be used for cooking. Olive oil is also considered very healthful because of its mixture of mono and poly unsaturated fats and its omega 9 essential fatty acids. Studies suggest that moderate olive oil intake can reduce risk of heart disease and help regulate cholesterol. Buy extra virgin olive oil for best flavor and health benefits. Sunflower and safflower oils are good sources of omega 6 fatty acids. Safflower is also high in vitamin E. Canola oil is one of the lowest in saturated fat and is my favorite all-purpose oil because it is healthful, flavorless (thus works in lots of different kinds of dishes, including desserts), and doesn't burn easily. Never use hydrogenated oil, as it contains very unhealthful trans fats.|`|F2ugW4cRaa	The main point is they have different flash points. (when they smoke), but taste can come into it.<br>  <br>  Read all about it below.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	It's not a stupid question.  It's quite complex but in general, different oils have different tastes, and smoke points, so they're better at some tasks than others.<br>  <br>  For instance, extra virgin olive oil should only be used in situations where you want to really taste the oil - such as dressing a salad, or brushing on bruschetta, or dipping bread into.  You wouldn't want to cook or fry with this because it has a low smoke point, and any sort of prolonged heat will destroy the taste that you paid that extra money for.<br>  <br>  Regular olive oil is ok for saute'ing but I wouldn't use it for deep frying because, again, it has a low smoke point.<br>  <br>  Corn oil is a good all purpose oil for baking, cooking, and frying because it has almost no taste.<br>  <br>  Some oils are considered "better" for you than others because of the type(s) of fats they contain.  Olive oil is considered healthier because it doesn't raise your cholesterol.<br>  <br>  A popular cooking trick is to combine two oils together.  For instance, when making an Asian style dish, I'll throw some sesame oil in the pan with some corn oil.  The corn oil takes the heat better, but I want the extra flavor from the sesame oil.  Companies are now selling blended oils, mainly mixing olive oil and corn oil together.  Don't fall for the hype.  It's still cheaper to buy the oils separately and just use them together when you want.|`|cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef and similar to the first fellow it is not a stupid question, and in some ways it is your own taste. Olive oil is fine for some things whether it is regular or extra virgin, canola, corn, peanut, soya, veg, safflower, sunflower and others are personal choices, some have a higher temperature range than others.<br>  <br>  There are other like hazelnut, avocado, almond and other nut oils that are used for finishing or in salads not for hot foods, far from a lecture and those who will sight the health properties, it is alot more again your choice, I use olive oil for dressings (regular and EV) and either peanut or canola for cooking. Taste is one thing but your lifestyle and cooking likes are the reason for choosing the oil you want.

uq4ZuWnEaa	I have never bought a mix or frozen and have always made my own however I had the shock of my life today when shopping there were 4 or 5 old women discussing which ready mix pancake mixture they deemed best to buy.  I am 57 and they were old enough to be my mums I was totally shocked and disgusted that they should stoop so low as to buy this rubbish and what makes it really bad is to think that I have had a heart attack and I am careful of what I eat and they were all as old as my mum.  Making pancake mix is so easy even my 7 year old grand-daughters can make it not to mention my grandson who is 10 and can prepare a meal although I cook it for safety reasons of course.|`|Gem96NQyaa	I usually buy the just-add-water mix.

I personally do not think this is a good law in the US. The reason that weed i s still illegal is because the government would not be able to collect much taxes on it. Tobacco needs certain climate to grow, alcohol takes a while to ferment, but weed can be grown almost anywhere. If it was legal tons of people would just buy the plants and grow them in their houses which would be tax free and make the government practically no money off of it. If they keep it illegal they make money off of fines etc. They think that it is more valuable to them illegal than it is legal.|`|39e96e9e3c0bce02422416332ccfeecbaa	it was originally made illegal when there wasn't much known about it.  people thought the reefer madness was realistic.  part of the drive was that they thought it would drive you insane, the other part was that organized religion wants to maintain a monopoly on spiritual experience.  that's still true today, but much more important is the fact that marijuana is easy to grow on your own, which means that it would be almost impossible to collect taxes on, and so it's cheaper and easier to keep the status quo.<br>  for practical purposes it's impossible to overdose on marijuana, and no one has ever died as a direct result of marijuana use.  marijuana is less addictive and less harmful to the body than tobacco or alcohol.|`|tGwPIV3iaa	Are you sure?

Delicious. Once the sauce is simmering add the chops back in and finish cooking. <br>  <br>  Or, do one cup apple cider, one cup chicken or veg stock, half cup brown sugar, 2-3 cloves garlic, salt and pepper, soya sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Some shallots diced very small are nice with this too. Use the same method of browning the outsides of the chops, and the removing them for a while, then add them back in. This is reminiscent of Chinese garlic spare ribs from a Chinese food restaurant. <br>  <br>  Another option is using the cream of mushroom soup from a can (or cream of broccoli, or celery, whatever) and add some chopped fresh spinach to the soup while it cooks in the skillet with the pork chops.|`|K4rP4A0naa	I like them fried and topped with store bought apple sauce and served with mashed potato and steamed beans or broccoli. Can't get much easier than that.<br>  <br>  If the produce is good quality and you season the food well, it will taste great though. To jazz it up you can make your own apple sauce by gently simmering a chopped cooking apple, 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. sherry or cider vinegar and 1 tsp. brown sugar plus salt and pepper to taste.<br>  <br>  Good mashed potato is made by picking a floury potato with good flavour (Dutch Cream are good if you can get them) and simmering with 2 tsp. salt until just soft. You must drain the water well and leave on the heat. You want to evaportate most of the moisture so they don't end up lumpy. Mash thoroughly while on the lowest flame then add about 1 tbsp. butter per 2 large potatoes. You can add more if you like but that's about the minimum you'd want. Mash the butter through, then add milk or cream (makes it richer) until you get the desired consistency.|`|XnEnelsBaa	Transform a boring grilled porn chop with mixed herbs.

wyvSAhtZaa	The only thing I would be concerned with is the "whey powder". Whey is usually a byproduct of cheese production, and is the liquid remaining after milk has been curdled into cheese by means of "rennet". Rennet is sometimes extracted from the 4th stomach of slaughtered calves, and since whey is leftover from this, I would watch out. However, most companies now use vegetable or artificial rennet-which are vegetarian.
vs5rK3iRaa	The heavy cream has about twice as much milk fat as the half & half, but it should be quite tasty.|`|wPM6eBkWaa	It will be heavier and richer in flavor.  If you are okay with that, it will be just fine.  Might be a bit over powering and take away from the other flavors.  Adjust other ingredients as needed.|`|EMDNVrcjaa	Yes, she could substitute with heavy cream.

Ax54M1Dhaa	A very slow braise would do the trick (hope you have a lot of time on your hands).  To braise anything, first, season with salt and brown it on all sides in the dutch oven.  Remove and set aside (you'll be returning it soon)  In the dutch oven you may want to sweat which means cook until onions are translucent, some veggies (onions, carrots, and celery are always a good bet) maybe some garlic and any other aromatic ingredients you want to get going.  Then you'll want to pour in some kind of flavorful liquid or a combination of a few.  Some good ones are red wine, beef stock, port and red wine together.  Just pour in enough to cover the veggies for now.  Scrape the bottom of the dutch oven with a wooden spoon and get up all the little bits left over from the browning.  Put the meat back in and add enough liquid to go about half way up the meat.  Spoon some over the top and then cover with the lid.  Stick the whole thing in a 250 degree oven.  Turn it every once and a while and wait for the magic.  If you're doing all 5 pound this will take some time.  Check it every hour for the first couple and then every half hour or so.  If you want to make sure it's cooked through use a thermometer in the thickest part of the thickest piece and make sure it reads somewhere around 175-180 degrees|`|hHCdXq0Naa	I made a 10-lb brisket for Christmas that was great.  I marinaded it overnight (in a big plastic baggie) with brisket marinade.  Then, I dry rubbed it and slow-roasted for 4-5 hours (mine was larger than yours) at 300.  I covered with foil for about half the time; then opened the foil. You can baste with BBQ sauce the last 1/2 hour or so, but that's not necessary.|`|FBmahP95aa	The trick to getting any slab of meat tender is long cook time on low heat. Put about 1/2 of fluid (water, watered down marinade, soda, whatever you want your meat to be infused with) in an oven pan. Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Put the oven on 350. Put in the meat and walk away. If you have a meat thermometer, the temperature to aim for is 180-190 in the middle of the thickest part of the meat.<br>  <br>  One other thing you can do before you put the meat in the oven is sear the outside really fast and really hot. If you have an electric grill/griddle get it really hot, sear the meat for less than 1 minute on each side, then put it in the oven as stated above. The reason to do this is to keep the meat juices inside. Searing the outside will "seal" the meat, keeping the juices trapped on the inside.|`|n6NthDxwaa	Try using coke or Dr. Pepper- never tried it, but my dad uses it, and his is always tender-|`|9mwEu0Afaa	yes marinate it for a minimum of 4 hours to 24 hours and slow cook it on a low temp should fall apart with any fork.|`|AA11767076	I love this one over mashed potatoes or buttered noodles:<br>  <br>  Flavorful brisket is an ideal candidate for oven braising.

In a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the brisket and cook, turning as needed, until well browned on all sides, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to a platter.<br>  <br>  Cook the vegetables and the brisket:<br>  Add the onions, celery and carrots to the drippings in the pot and sauté over medium heat until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Pour in the broth and stir, scraping up the browned bits from the pan bottom. Stir in the wine, the tomatoes and their juices. Return the meat and any juices from the platter to the pot. Cover, transfer to the oven and bake until the brisket is fork-tender, 3 to 3 1/2 hours.<br>  <br>  Make the sauce:<br>  Transfer the brisket to a carving board, cover loosely with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 minutes. Spoon off and discard the fat from the liquid in the pot. Place the pot over medium-high heat and bring the liquid to a boil. Stir in the marjoram, reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the liquid is reduced by one-fourth, 7 to 10 minutes. Adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper.<br>  <br>  Slice the brisket across the grain and serve with some of the sauce and vegetables spooned on top. Serves 4 (makes about 10 cups sliced or shredded brisket total).

vSprOb5qaa	What I do that is basically easy for me, is I buy chicken breasts with skin on and bone in and also a box of the stuffing mix you cook on top of the stove. Make the stuffing according to directions and set aside.<br>    I wash the chicken breasts and pat dry. Then with the breasts sitting on the cutting board, I use a knife to cut a small slit right above the rib bones..big enough so you can put your thumbs in and then make a "pocket" inside being careful not to push through the thick back side. Then stuff that pocket with the stuffing mix making sure you don't push all the way through. You may want to pull the skin to the front and fasten with a toothpick, however I don't always do that.<br>     Place stuffed chicken breasts in an oblong baking dish that has a cover and bake at 350 for about 40 min. basting a couple of times. Remove the cover at 40 minutes and baste the chicken breasts one final time and sprinkle with paprika; continue baking for about another 15 - 20 minutes or until you know it's done. One large stuffed chicken breast is usually more than enough for one person, especially if mashed potatoes are served also.  You can use foil if your baking dish doesn't have a cover as long as the foil doesn't lay on the chicken breasts while cooking and stick to the chicken.|`|wPM6eBkWaa	Here is my link to some grilled chicken recipes.

Using a meat mallet, pound out the steak, about 1/4-inch. Season with salt and pepper. Season 2 cups of the flour with Essence. Dredge the steaks in the season flour. Dip the steaks in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off. Dredge the steaks in the seasoned flour, coating each side completely. Add enough oil to a large skillet to fill about 1/4-inch of the pan. Heat the oil. When the oil is hot, carefully lay the steaks in the hot oil. Pan-fry the steaks for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until golden. Season with salt and pepper. In another skillet, render the bacon until crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the onions and continue to saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup of flour and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.

AA12330904	Shaking Beef (Bo Luc Lac)<br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice <br>  1 tablespoon fish sauce <br>  1 tablespoon sugar <br>  2 Thai bird chiles or 1/2 serrano chile, chopped <br>  1 tablespoon oyster sauce <br>  2 teaspoons soy sauce <br>  2/3 pound beef sirloin or flank steak, cut into 1/2-inch cubes <br>  2 to 3 tablespoons vegetable oil <br>  2 cloves garlic, sliced <br>  1/4 ripe pineapple (about 1/2 cup), cut into bite-sized slices about 1/4-inch thick (optional) <br>  1/2 cup Asian basil leaves, cut in half <br>  1/4 red onion, thinly sliced lengthwise <br>  3 cups watercress, washed, picked over, and torn into bite-sized sprigs <br>  1 ripe tomato, cut into thin wedges <br>  <br>  Directions<br>  Combine the lime juice, fish sauce, sugar and chiles in a large bowl. Set aside. <br>  <br>  Place the oyster sauce, soy sauce and beef in a medium bowl and toss to coat the meat evenly. <br>  <br>  Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the garlic and stir until fragrant, about 5 seconds. Add the beef and quickly stir-fry it until just charred on the edges, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add to the bowl with the lime sauce. <br>  <br>  Add the pineapple slices, if using, Asian basil and red onion to the beef mixture. Spread the watercress and tomatoes in an attractive manner on a serving platter. Arrange the beef mixture and all its juices on the watercress and serve immediately (if desired, with a warm baguette or steamed rice to soak up the juices). <br>  <br>  Note: Another way of presenting bo luc lac is to omit the lime dressing completely and serve the beef with a dipping salt mixture made with 1 1/2 tablespoons sea salt, 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice. <br>  <br>  I hope this was useful,Take Care!!! :)

If you smell anything but apples, you're doing something wrong.|`|m1cEbzBcaa	if you are using a good fermentation setup, it doesn't smell much at all... it might have a little fruity smell, likely you are doing apple, so it will be slightly apple smell.|`|6YUeJCEQaa	not really. I've made it plenty of times and its not a strong or unpleasant smell (neither is beer, wine or mead). but you will smell it. The style of cider you make, how much fermentable sugar, the yeast you use and the temperature will determine how fast it will ferment. very active fermentation will give off more co2 and will have more of a smell but they will complete faster and stop smelling. its really nothing to worry about though, it shouldn't stink up your house much.<br>  if it smells really bad like poo or rotten eggs its likley contaminated with wild yeast and you won't want to drink it anyway.|`|DT2mU1jOaa	Fruity, yeasty, overall not to bad but if you can keep it in a closed space the other household members may appreciate it.

Stir in bread crumbs, minced onion, flour and seasoning. Mix well. Shape mixture into patties.  Place patties on a baking sheet sprayed with ‘Pam’, and then spray the top of the patties.  Bake at 350 about 30 minutes or until golden.  Turn them over midway thru.  - OR - In a medium skillet, heat oil over medium high heat until hot.

NeTNnvSZaa	The taste.  Sanka is yucky and doesn't really taste that much like real coffee.
mxEzagl7aa	Unfortunately due to the wide range of pastries that are available, there is no simple single answer for this question. Different pastries require different processes and different machines to create them.  The problem is also mad worse by the fact that a number of major pastry makers rely on specially built or modified machines as well as trade secretes to produce their individual products.  They specifically don’t discuss their entire process in depth for fear that competitors will steal ideas.<br>  <br>  On top of this, pastry production in the United States can vary to a high degree.  A lot of production is done in specialized local bakeries on a local or semi-regional level.  These types of businesses will actually use larger versions of traditional bakery equipment in many cases.  Other large industries are nationally distributing their products, so large factories with specially built equipment are often need to get the production quotas that a specific manufacturer requires.  These industries are the most varied, the most specialized, and the rely on some of the largest numbers of trade secrets.

8077a0fe445d32340f8fb7b694fc56e9aa	* Chateaubriand steak — Usually served for two, cut from the large head of the tenderloin.<br>      <br>  * Chuck steak — A cut from neck to the ribs.<br>     <br>   * Cube steak — A cut of meat, usually top round, tenderized by fierce pounding with a mallet or mechanical blades.<br>      <br>  * Filet mignon — A small, choice cut from the small end of the tenderloin; the most tender and most expensive cut by weight.<br>  <br>     <br>   * Flank steak — From the underside. Not as tender as steaks cut from the rib or loin.<br>      <br>  * Flat iron steak — A cut from under the shoulder blade.<br>      <br>  * Hanger steak or (French) onglet — a steak from near the center of the diaphragm. Flavorful, and very tender towards the edges, but sinewy in the middle. Often called the butcher's tenderloin or hanging tender.<br>  <br>  * Popeseye steak — thinly sliced Rump steak, originating in Scotland and available in the UK<br>  <br>   * Rib eye steak — A rib steak consisting of the longissimus muscle and the spinalis or cap. This comes from the primal rib used to make prime rib which is typically oven roasted as opposed to grilled as is typical with rib eye.<br>     <br>   * Round steak, rump steak, or (French) rumsteak — A cut from the rump of the animal. A true grilling steak with good flavor though it can be tough, if not cooked properly.<br>      <br>  * Sirloin steak — A steak cut from the hip. Also tends to be less tough, resulting in a higher price tag.<br>      <br>  * Outside Skirt steak — A steak made from the diaphragm. Very flavorful, but also rather tough.<br>      <br>  * Inside skirt steak - A steak from the flank or bottom sirloin similar in appearance but more tender than the outside.<br>     <br>   * Strip steak — (also known as Delmonico, Kansas City strip, New York strip, and Entrec?te), A high-quality steak cut from the strip loin, a muscle that is relatively low in connective tissue, so it is particularly tender.<br>      <br>  * T-bone steak and Porterhouse - A cut from the tenderloin and strip loin, connected with a T-shaped bone (lumbar vertebra). The two are distinguished by the size of the tenderloin in the cut. T-bones have smaller tenderloin sections, while the Porterhouse – though generally smaller in the strip – will have more tenderloin. T-bone and Porterhouse steaks are among the most expensive steaks on a menu because of the large individual portion size.<br>  <br>  Several other foods are called "steak" without actually being steaks:<br>  <br>  * Salisbury steak — Not a steak, but rather a patty from ground beef made with onions, usually bread crumbs, and occasionally mushrooms. Also known as "Hamburger Steak" or "Minute Steak" (due to its shorter cooking time). It is the least expensive cut of steak, usually because it is made of lower grade meat.<br>     <br>   * Steak tartare or tartar steak - Finely chopped raw fillet of beef, onion, parsley, capers, a hot sauce (usually Worcestershire) and raw egg.|`|EMDNVrcjaa	beef·steak (bēf′stāk′)<br>  <br>  noun<br>  <br>  a slice of beef, esp. from the loin, cut thick for broiling or frying<br>  <br>  Here is a website with lots of different beefsteak recipes.|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	I would use Porterhouse personally.<br>  <br>  BEEFSTEAK SMOTHERED IN ONIONS  <br>  1 doz. sm. onions<br>  1 slice porterhouse steak, cut thick<br>  Salt<br>  Pepper<br>  <br>  Heat a frying pan hissing hot.

He is very proud of the jam he makes from his tomatoes. <br>  In addition to a local market, most of the households sell their produce to the secondary school, hospital, and lodges on the island. Those who produce high value crops such as chilly peppers and beetroot also take them to mainland Malawi.<br>  <br>  "The Likoma experience is a microcosm of what needs to happen all over Malawi," says Timothy Gilbo, the World Bank’s Country Manager for Malawi. "There is need to transfer knowledge to people and encourage them to do things differently. Specializing in a high-value crop at household level and trading it, is a good path out of poverty."<br>  According to Gilbo, progress on the island shows that a little money with the right thinking and willingness to change can achieve a lot.<br>  Households compete for progress The Lake Malawi Project has reached out to the islanders with about $5000 from the World Bank’s Civil Society Fund (CSF) from 2006-2008.

UIXKTaghaa	If you are gonig to get a board game then make sure it's one that is chance based, rather than skill.  You don't know your guests very well and the last thing you need is for them to play scrabble if they are dyslexic!  Go for something silly that gets people talking.  We've got "the worst case survival game" and "The great game of britain" both of which are chance based, but lead to talk - we've also got "family fortunes" which can be a laugh.  After dinner trivia (non competative) sometimes is good.  But there is also jenga, or you could get out a familiar childhood game such as ker-plunk.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it helps to have 6 people rather than 4 people round, and if you are both shy, then invite around a couple that you know that aren't and they will do the awkward ice breaking for you!  (Probably a bit late for that, but we've done that before.)<br>  <br>  Have a concious list of questions you could ask them to break the ice, such as "How did you two meet?" or "When did you move here?"  or "Where have you visited on holiday?"  Try to ask open questions rather than something that can be asnwered "Yes" or "No" as this will give them space to talk, and sound interested in them, even if you think they are dead boring!  That way they'll carry on talking about themselves.  Listen to what they are saying and quiz them a little more about what they've said rather than waiting to jump in.<br>  <br>  Background music will prevent awkward pauses, you can also use it a spring board to find out what music they like and then discuss CD collections which sometimes leads on to favourite films.<br>  <br>  Don't rush to the board game - sometimes you can just fill several hours with chat, and they'll feel happy that you've got to know them.  Don't rush the dinner courses either.  Let people wait a bit for pudding.  It helps to have a pause and chat between courses, that way you don't get to the awkward "nothing in front of us" stage too soon.<br>  <br>  Obviously - make sure they like games before introducing a board game - they might loath them!|`|nfSzQDyjaa	Singstarr !    amazing !|`|LjBbJCxHaa	get the wii out!!<br>  <br>  a bit of bowling or boxing will break the ice and you will all have a right laugh!!<br>  <br>  good luck!!<br>  <br>  =0)|`|ybDrwqFbaa	thumper, flip cup, beer pong|`|hT7BhNamaa	Rob, basically its just the four of you, a dinner, you don't know very well. you have dinner, then have coffee later with a nice Port or liqueur bit later, but have a chat rather than the board games and try and get to know them better, background music helps to relieve the tension also, not head banging or grunge stuff either.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|0e7e2273a98e965ef6963c7287e9faffaa	Karaoke or Wii always goes down well at my place!!

y8b86tTEaa	Don't but it. And don't buy a set in general, unless somehow you know for sure, you need all of the knives in that set, which I have never seen so far. All the sets including that voodoo include at least 2-3 knives that you'd never use.<br>  <br>  Whenever the maker uses something good, or at least acceptable steel, they as usual state that clearly. It's part of the promotion. Mostly makers state knife Rockwell hardness of the steel too. Anything below 54HRC is too soft to hold any acceptable edge. <br>  <br>  As for the Voodo knives, I'd be very suspicious of any kitchen knife that doesn't state the steel used in it. "Stainless Steel" or "Surgical Stainless Steel" is very vague and as usual refers to crappy 420J mark steel or worse. Of course there can be good surprises, but not at that price. <br>  <br>  Overview of kitchen knife steels is here - <a href="http://www.zknives.com/knives/kitchen/misc/articles/kkchoser/kksteel.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.zknives.com/knives/kitchen/mi...</a><br>  <br>  Western kitchen knives are relatively soft - 54-56HRC on Rockwell scale. Those are pretty easy to sharpen compared to much harder Japanese knives 62-67HRC. So, I wouldn't be worried about sharpening about  those, just  the thing is the edge won't last long.<br>  <br>  For 70-100$ you can buy 2-3 pretty good kitchen knives and you can pick exactly the ones you need, not wasting money on extras that you will never use. Minimal set in home kitchen would be small 3-4" paring knife for delicate tasks, 8-10" chef's knife(some prefer 6-7") for general cutting and serrated bread knife. You can get all that under 100 and use them.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but the way things are today you won't buy good 5-6 knives for 69$ or even 100$.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if you are on the market for kitchen knives, don't fall for marketing hype(BS) about fully-forged-fully-tanged-bolstered knives. <br>  <br>  Good kitchen knife doesn't require neither of those, you just  pay extra money. Global chefs knives are stamped,w/o any bolster and they will outcut forged Western counterparts any day. Plus they cost cheaper than premium western knives. And Globals aren't really high end knives either.<br>  If you like a knife that's one thing, but don't pass on the knife because it's not forged or doesn't have a bolster or a full tang. Those don't define a good knife.<br>  <br>  For more on how to choose kitchen knives - <a href="http://www.zknives.com/knives/kitchen/misc/articles/kkchoser/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.zknives.com/knives/kitchen/mi...</a><br>  There is a section that lists some pretty good knives from price/performance standpoint too.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	I don't know about the knives, but I do like their "Ex" holder!<br>  Generally, stainless steel knives are difficult to sharpen because of the chromium added to the alloy.  They are convenient for clean-up, though, and you never have to worry about rust as you do with high-carbon steel.<br>  If you can return the knives if you are unsatisfied with them, then go ahead and give them a try.  If not, I'd suggest going to a reputable restaurant supply shop and buying one or two well-made, comfortable (in your grip) knives to start, then building your set as time and money allows.

I'm a vegan and contrary to what someone said, I am not a fat whale. :) I'm not sure if there are vegan pork rinds, but there is so much wonderful food you can eat as a vegan. Give it a shot. When I became a vegetarian, giving up bacon was hard for me, but now I would never think of eating it. Your tastes really do change when you start eating differently. Why not give it a shot? You may have to wean yourself off them, but I'm sure you will end up not missing them at all. Pork rinds are really unhealthy anyway. If you need a fried food fix, why not try making some fried tofu or enjoying some wontons?|`|klAILLzqaa	Why would you want to do that? All the vegans I know are fat whales!
9epL6qjBaa	If you marinade any fish or shellfish in Lime Juice, the acid in the juice will actually "cook" the fish.<br>  <br>  I'd use the Chinese 5 spice in a little olive oil and some fresh pressed garlic. If you have any soy sauce, add a little to it.  Mix it all in a mixing bowl, and save a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the marinade for basting later.  Stick the cup in the refrigerator. <br>  <br>  Place the prawn in the mixture in the marinade left in the mixing bowl  for at least four hours to overnight.  Swish the bowl occasionally to mix them up an also to keep the mariade over them.<br>  <br>  Lastly, I'd either grill or saute these to cook them.  If you saute - use just a large enough pan to hold all of the Prawns.  Just a little olive oil in the pan should be fine.  Cook until pink and curled, but be careful not to over cook.  Use part of the marinade in the cup during the last minute or so of cooking to add some flavore.<br>  <br>  If you grill, since they are prawns, they should be large enough not to fall between the grill grates into the fire.  Just cook until done.  Brush with the marinade in the cup.<br>  <br>  Wine suggestions...  I highly recommend a Sauvignon Blanc with this meal.

The recipe I use is typically for a whole chicken, so I would substitute 4 - 5 legs and thighs in this case.<br>  <br>  Take the cleaned pieces and put them in a rectangular glass baking dish. Mix one small or 1/2 large bottle of Catalina Island French salad dressing with one envelope of Lipton's French Onion Soup Mix. At this stage, depending on your preference, you could add to the pan of chicken any of the following: Onions, 1 inch dice, red/green/yellow bell pepper, 1 inch dice, and/or pineapple tidbits. Pour the sauce mix over the whole thing and swirl it around to coat all the pieces. Cover with foil to keep moist.<br>  <br>  Bake in a 375 degree oven until the chicken juices run clear. You will want to make a batch of fluffy rice or mashed potatoes to soak up the delicious sauce from the chicken bake.

Spray a glass 8 inch by 8 inch baking dish with Pam. Sprinkle cheese in pan. Drizzle margarine over cheese.<br>  In mixing bowl, whisk eggs, milk, mustard, salt, and pepper. Slowly pour over cheese. Put in preheated oven and bake for about 27-30 minutes. You want it to be set in the middle -- when you reach in with a potholder and slightly shake the dish, the middle isn't all jiggly.

d41bd2987be2bbb3bb7086e0162c5b82aa	Hi, Dot!<br>  There are DEFINITELY many ways to enjoy an avocado! I personally enjoy adding slices of it into my veggie or legume soups for extra richness and texture contrast. As you already know, avocado is a fruit- and it's enjoyed in SWEET and savory dishes. In my mother's native country(Philippines), many ppl make simple sweet and creamy milkshakes out of avocados. I highly suspect you are vegan ;) so you can substitute rice, soy, almond, or hemp milk and get decadent results! When I tried it for the first time, it was soooo delicious and it hits the spot! You'll probably crave one from time to time after the first time you try it. Anyway, here's a recipe. I dare you to enjoy =)<br>  <br>  Prep Time: 5 minutes<br>  Ingredients:<br>  2 to 3 cups cold milk<br>  1 ripe avocado<br>  3 tablespoons sugar<br>  handful of ice (optional)<br>  Preparation:<br>  Peel the avocado and cut in half. Discard the pit.<br>  <br>  Put the avocado and sugar in a blender with 1 cup of milk. Blend until very creamy and smooth.<br>  <br>  Gradually add another cup or two of milk to make the shake as thin or as thick as you like. How much milk you need will also depend on the size of the avocado.<br>  <br>  Add a handful of ice to the blender if you like your shake well-chilled, and blend for another minute.<br>  <br>  Serves 2 to 3.|`|8Wqbz6FMaa	How about a delicious dessert?  Mash it with fork then mix with sweetened condensed milk and chill in the freezer for 30 minutes.  The sweetened condensed milk brings out the best flavor of the avocado.  This has been my family's favorite dessert since forever.|`|4636c77ba0bd1830e80c0cae29293574aa	put in on a sandwich! chop it up and add it to a salad!|`|VdbhuUYBaa	Include slices in a veggie wrap.|`|pEiCmTpTaa	Slice it up in a salad or a wrap<br>  <br>  Edit: I found a website(link below) with a TON of recipes for Avocados.<br>  <br>  Here is one I thought sounded good<br>  <br>  Avocado Fettuccine <br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>  2 tsp olive oil <br>  1 Cup diced green peppers <br>  ? Cup white wine vinegar <br>  ? Cup chopped fresh basil <br>  1 ? Cups sundried tomatoes, diced <br>  ? Cup chopped green onion <br>  1 California Avocado, diced <br>  1 Pound dried fettuccine <br>   <br>  Instructions<br>  <br>  In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, peppers, vinegar, basil, green onions, sundried tomatoes and half of the California avocado. <br>  Toss ingredients together well so they are evenly coated with the oil and vinegar. <br>  Cook pasta in boiling water for 6 minutes or until "al dente." <br>  Drain pasta and pour into salad bowl with the other ingredients while the pasta is still hot. <br>  Toss together and serve immediately, using the remaining California avocado as a garnish on top of the pasta.|`|AA11015885	Put it in a omelet.<br>  Add slices of avocado to your bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches.<br>  Top your salad with sliced avocado.<br>  Just cut it half, take out the pit, sprinkle with salt and pepper and eat it out of the skin with a spoon.<br>  Stuff them with your favorite tuna, shrimp, crab or chicken salad.<br>  Make a avocado and mango salsa.<br>  And my all time favorite..<br>  <br>  Avocado Ahi Poke<br>  <br>  3/4 pound sashimi grade tuna steak, diced <br>  1/2 cup diced cucumber <br>  1 avocados - peeled, pitted and diced <br>  1/4 cup chopped green onion <br>  1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes <br>  1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds <br>  1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice <br>  2 teaspoons sesame oil <br>  1/2 cup soy sauce<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  DIRECTIONS:<br>  <br>  In a medium bowl, combine the ahi, cucumber, avocado, green onion, red pepper flakes and sesame seeds. Pour in the lemon juice, sesame oil and soy sauce, and stir carefully to blend so as not to mash the avocado. Place this bowl into a larger bowl that has been filled with ice. Chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes, but no longer - the terrific freshness of the fish will be lost.<br>  <br>  Once chilled, remove the bowl from the ice, and invert onto a serving plate. Serve with toasted bread or your favorite crackers.<br>  <br>  Edit:  To all that gave a thumbs down because of the raw fish, you really should give it a try, especially those that like sashimi.  It really is delicious and is served by many fine restaurants here in Hawaii as an elegant appetizer served in a chilled martinin glass.  Be adventurous!|`|Med8LbTcaa	I actually make this really good chocolate pudding/mousse with avocado.

iQo58ITZaa	Check the thermostat in the fridge.It maybe got knocked.Is the fridge over-packed?Lower it if need be.I have stored beets, carrots, apples in the garage, but they need to be protected by newspaper so that they don't freeze.I have on occasion stored other veggies, fruits if I was having a party and fridge was over-packed, in the garage, but same thing, they must be wrapped and not for a long period of time.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	It will not last in the pantry. Place the lettuce on one of the upper shelves in your fridge. Put a moist paper towel inside the container to maintain the right moisure level.If it still freezes, you need to turn down the thermostat in the refrigerator. <br>  <br>  Fruits last longer if you keep them separate from bananas. Bananas release a gas that speeds up the ripening process. Apples last longest and grapes better in the refrigerator. Vegies should be in your crisper. Again check the thermostat. The more dense, the longer it will last.

Not too much protein though. Whole grains and beans and legumes are power packed with fiber and protein. Avoid the fats, refined flour and the sugars. And eat a ton of good fresh veggies and greens, and start using Stevia in place of sweetener. In other words a balanced whole foods diet is best. Good Luck|`|PxJXJKCpaa	beans and peas.|`|BCzrcwKFaa	i'm assuming you are vegetarian or vegan and that this question is not misfiled.  i wouldn't suggest too many beans as part of weightloss - while they do contain fiber and protein, they can be quite high in calories.  eat something fiber-filled and super low calorie like cabbage, celery and fruits.  meat replacements like boca burgers and smart dogs are SUPER LOW in calories and have a good amount of protein.  <br>  if you don't already, cut out dairy.  eggs are fine for weightloss- good protein and healthy fats.  focus on eating less packaged foods and eat as much raw as you can!  <br>  <br>  good luck with weightloss :)|`|u6cFXfPnaa	Beans, lentils, and high-protein grains like quinoa all fit the bill. You can combine the two for the most filling, healthful meals. For example: a lentil or split pea dahl over brown rice, wild rice with peas, or pinto beans over quinoa.|`|cpnLw5H0aa	Rice and beans make a complete protein. But yes, legumes in general are good for that.  Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon has helped me a lot. Obviously, meat has a lot of protein! But if you are a vegan or vegetarian that won't help.

Nobody seems quite sure where it comes from, and I won’t bore you with a long disquisition concerning the scholarly debate on the matter, which is reflected in the varied origins given in major dictionaries. It’s likely to be from a Chinese dialect, imported into English through Malay. The original was a kind of fish sauce, though the modern Malay and Indonesian version, with the closely related name kecap, is a sweet soy sauce.<br>  <br>  Like their Eastern forerunners, Western ketchups were dipping sauces. I’m told the first ketchup recipe appeared in Elizabeth Smith’s book The Compleat Housewife of 1727 and that it included anchovies, shallots, vinegar, white wine, sweet spices (cloves, ginger, mace, nutmeg), pepper and lemon peel. Not a tomato in sight, you will note — tomato ketchup was not introduced until about a century later, in the US, and caught on only slowly. It was more usual to base the condiment on mushrooms, or sometimes walnuts.<br>  <br>  The confusion about names started even before Charles Lockyer wrote about it, since there is an entry dated 1690 in the Dictionary of the Canting Crew which gives it as catchup, which is another Anglicisation of the original Eastern term. Catchup was used much more in North America than in Britain: it was still common in the middle years of the nineteenth century, as in a story in Scribner’s Magazine in 1859: “I do not object to take a few slices of cold boiled ham ... with a little mushroom catchup, some Worcester sauce, and a pickle or so”. Indeed, catchup continued to appear in American works for some decades and is still to be found on occasion.<br>  <br>  There were lots of other spellings, too, of which catsup is the best known, a modification of catchup. You can blame Jonathan Swift for it if you like, since he used it first in 1730: “And, for our home-bred British cheer, Botargo, catsup, and caveer”. [Caveer is caviar; botargo is a fish-based relish made of the roe of the mullet or tunny.] That form was also once common in the US but is much less so these days, at least on bottle labels: all the big US manufacturers now call their product ketchup.<br>  <br>  Simple question: complicated answer!|`|aKvxy3xBaa	They are the same, just a different way to spell it.|`|u4LLFhORaa	none there is no difference except the way its spelled|`|r8Ulgpvaaa	just the spelling...there both the same thing lol :)

It is an ancient whole grain from South America which contains all seven essential amino acids. It comes in three colors - white, red and black. It needs to be rinsed with boiling water prior to cooking it to remove any bitterness. <br>  There is also a Quinoa Pasta which is light and flovely.Just sauce it as you normally would -with  a Tomato Basil Sauce and some Parmesan, some garlic bread and salad-- fabulous!<br>  Of course there is Tofu and Tempeh, Brown Rice and Beans, Tofurky Italian Sausage or, Keilbasa, Yves Hot Dogs (all Soy) Gimme Lean 'Ground Beef Style', Gimme Lean Breakfast Sausage,  Macaroni and Cheese, Vegetarian Baked Beans and Tofu Pups, The list is endless and there are great recipes available on line too. <br>  Check out www.your-vegetarian-kitchen.com  .<br>  Vegan Tofu Rancheros <br>  Great for Breakfast, Brunch or Sunday Night Supper our vegan tofu rancheros make a colorful, protein packed tex-mex scramble that sings in your vegetarian kitchen!<br>  1 Package Firm Tofu<br>  2 Tbs. Extra Virgin Olive Oil<br>  1 tsp. Chopped Fresh Garlic<br>  1 Cup sliced Button Mushrooms<br>  1 small Onion sliced stem to stern<br>  1/4 Cup each Red, Green and Yellow Peppers cut into chunks<br>  1 handful Grape Tomatoes<br>  1 Tbs. Turmeric<br>  1 tsp. Chili Powder<br>  Salt and Pepper to taste<br>  Splash Shoyu<br>  Five grains Black Salt* (optional)<br>  *Black Salt is available at Indian Grocery Stores. It has a high Sulfa content so you will need to use only as much as fits on the tip of a sharp knife. It is the Sulfa content that pulls the tofu into the familiar smell and taste of ‘egg’.<br>  In a frying pan sauté 1 Cup sliced button mushrooms with freshly chopped garlic in Extra Virgin Olive Oil until golden. Remove from the pan and reserve. Next add to the pan 1 small onion sliced thinly from stem to stern, and half each of red, yellow and green peppers cut into small chunks. Sauté until the peppers are soft and the onion has becomes transparent. Add a handful of whole grape tomatoes. Stir. <br>  Add 1 Tbs. Turmeric and 1 Tsp Chili Powder, and crumble in 1 package Firm Tofu. Mix through the spice and vegetables until the tofu is heated through and well colored, and the tomatoes begin to pop. Add the Mushrooms, a splash of Shoyu or Tamari and salt and pepper to taste. Plate and serve with toast, or muffins.<br>  <br>  Enjoy Your Vegetarian Kitchen’s amazingly flavorful, crispy, golden vegan tofu cutlets. An entrée guaranteed to please the most discriminating palate. You'll need Organic Extra Firm Tofu — allow a minimum of at least 1/4 pound or three slices per person. You will need to do the following marinade twice so make sure that you have double the amount of the following on hand:<br>  1/2 Cup Eden Tamari or Shoyu<br>  1/4 Cup Eden Mirin<br>  1 Tbs. Ground Coriander<br>  1 Tbs. Ground Cumin<br>  1 Tbs. Minced Garlic<br>  1 Tbs. Minced Fresh Ginger<br>  1/2 Cup Toasted Sesame Oil<br>  Splash San-J Szechuan Hot Sauce<br>  1 Tsp each Granulated Garlic and Ginger (used only in the mixture for painting the tofu)<br>  Szeged Hot Hungarian Paprika<br>  3 Large Spanish Onions sliced Nituke<br>  Slice large Spanish Onions thinly. (Nituki - from end to end rather than in rounds or half moons.)<br>  Place in a large bowl along with:<br>  1 Tbs. each finely minced garlic and ginger<br>  1 Tbs. each ground Cumin and ground Coriander seeds<br>  1/2 Cup each Toasted Sesame Oil, Tamari or Shoyu<br>  1/4 Cup Eden Mirin, along with a splash of San-J Szechwan Hot Sauce. <br>  Set the onions nituki to wilt in the shoyu mixture for a minimum of 15 minutes while the tofu is sliced. Line baking sheet(s) with parchment and a thick layer of wilted onions and sauce. <br>  Place each block of Extra Firm Tofu on a cutting board and cut it in half diagonally. Set the halves upright so that the hypotenuse of the triangular wedge faces you. Slice thin triangles from the blocks of tofu. You should get 6 thin slices from each half. Allow a minimum of 3 slices per person. Place each slice on the bed of wilted onions in a geometrical pattern. <br>  In a separate small bowl create a duplicate of the marinade without the sesame oil. Using a pastry brush, paint the triangles with the mixture of 1/2 Cup each Tamari or Shoyu, 1/4 Cup Eden Mirin, along with a splash of San-J Szechwan Hot Sauce. Add 1 Tbs. each Ground Coriander, Ground Cumin, 1 Tsp each Granulated Garlic and Ginger; and a splash of Szechwan Hot Sauce to taste. Then paint each with Toasted Sesame Oil. Sprinkle with Szeged Paprika. <br>  Bake at 400° for 30 - 40 minutes until golden and somewhat crispy.

Place a wide, heavy skillet or fry pan over high heat for 2 minutes. Meanwhile, rub both sides of meat with the salt and cumin. When the pan is hot (really hot) brown meat on both sides and remove from pan. Add just enough vegetable oil to cover the bottom of the pan then add the onion and garlic. Stir constantly until onion is softened. Add the tomato juice, vinegar, olives, and raisins. Bring to a boil and reduce the liquid by half. Create a pouch with wide, heavy duty aluminum foil. Place half the reduced liquid/chunk mixture on the foil, add the roast, and then top with the remaining mixture. Close the pouch, and wrap tightly in another complete layer of foil. Cook for 3 to 3 1/2 hours or until a fork pushes easily into the meat. Remove from oven and rest (still wrapped) for at least 1/2 hour. Snip off 1 corner of the foil pouch and drain the liquid into a bowl or measuring cup. Add some of the "chunkies" and puree with an immersion blender. Slice meat thinly, or pull apart with a fork.

I don't believe that is a true vegetarian, but like I said I could be more strict then others.<br>  <br>  You could go here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.goveg.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.goveg.com/</a><br>  <br>  That site can help you look up recipes as well as give you a TON of information on being a vegetarian. You can also get a starter kit, which sends you more information on being a vegetarian to really help you make this kind of transition.<br>  <br>  You could also look at this site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peta.org/accidentallyVegan/" rel="nofollow">http://www.peta.org/accidentallyVegan/</a><br>  <br>  Now, even though it's "Vegan" food, all the stuff on there is also vegetarian, so maybe that can help you give you some ideas on what type of food you can have, as well as what you could buy to eat.<br>  <br>  Here is a vegetarian pyramid:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vegsource.com/nutrition/pyramid.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegsource.com/nutrition/pyram...</a><br>  <br>  This will help you with what you should try to consume and types of food and food groups you can eat from.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure that you are taking some kind of multi-vitamin. A B12 supplement is needed too. B12 is one of the main sources in meat products, you really need this. Also, you should make sure you take something with iron since meat and fish helps with iron. It's very important that you take supplements when you are a vegetarian so you can help consume all the right stuff you need to stay healthy.<br>  <br>  I'm sure if you go on google or any other search engines or vegetarian/vegan based websites you will be able to find out more information on being a vegetarian and what you can eat. <br>  <br>  Hopefully I helped you out a bit, good luck and all the best! :-)|`|41d76be92aef7c87fe72ee0ffc81a2c3aa	I think it is very funny when people ask me things like this... all that being a vegetarian implies is that you don't eat meat, you can still eat every other thing as long as it doesn't have dead animals in it. If you still want to make recipes with meat in them just use tofu as a replacement.|`|7Rs2z1UIaa	I first need to know what classification of vegetarian you have chosen. Do you just avoid meats and seafood or also dairy, eggs and whatnot? <br>  For a nice, filling vegan meal, I would suggest Taboli. Taboli mix can be found at almost every grocery store in my area and that's saying something since there's not too much call for vegetarianism in my area of the US.<br>  Taboli is a kind of "soft" bulgar wheat that can softened using only vegetable oil and lemon juice. It makes the perfect cold salad that can be ready in about 4 hours or so. <br>  To make Taboli, buy a package of Taboli mix that can be found in the produce section of the grocery store in a smallish sealed plasic bag. If you cannot find it at your favorite store, try WalMart. They tend to carry it just about everywhere.<br>  On the back are the most simple instructions to prepare the Taboli. However, you can add whatever veggies you like to this salad. On top of the fresh tomatoes, cucumber and green onion, I also like to add some sliced olives and perhaps some fresh baby spinach. I've also used mandarin orange slices, dried cranberries and pecans. Very delicious! If it tastes too bland, you can always add a salad dressing or extra spices to bring in more flavor. <br>  This dish is filling and can keep in the fridge for quite a while. My suggestion is to make it in the morning and have it for dinner so the flavors have time to mingle. It's one of my favorite vegetarian meals.<br>  Also, if you search online for vegetarian or vegan recipes, there are literally thousands, if not millions, of recipes out there. Good luck and make sure to get plenty of proteins in other forms. Because you are so young, proteins are important to help you grow properly. An internet search or books from the local library will help you learn which plants contain the best proteins for you. Off the top of my head, tree nuts contain a goodly source that are easy to obtain.<br>  You can also get plenty of information from your local health food store if one is available near you.|`|u6cFXfPnaa	There is so much wonderful vegetarian food out there. It really shouldn't be too difficult. Here are some ideas of meals to make and meals you can find at restaurants:<br>  <br>  Breakfast foods:<br>  Oatmeal with dried or fresh fruit mixed in (or with chopped nuts)<br>  Cereal with milk, soymilk/ricemilk/almond milk & a banana<br>  Toast or bagel with butter (or vegan margarine)<br>  Bagels with hummus<br>  Toast with peanut butter<br>  Pancakes, waffles, and crepes<br>  Home-fried potatoes/hash browns<br>  Egg dishes (if you eat eggs) - omelets, scrambled eggs, etc. <br>  <br>  Quick, portable lunches:<br>  Peanut butter sandwich (or almond, cashew, or macadamia nut butter)<br>  Cheese sandwiches <br>  Hummus and cucumber sandwiches<br>  Pita pockets stuffed with hummus and veggies<br>  Pita and veggies to dip in hummus<br>  Pasta salad <br>  A thermos of vegetable, lentil, or bean soup (as long as the stock isn't meat-based)<br>  Small salads (add kidney or garbanzo beans and sprouts on top for protein)<br>   <br>  Entrees:<br>  Pasta with marinara sauce<br>  Pesto pasta<br>  Fettuccine Alfredo with steamed veggies<br>  Minestrone soup<br>  Lentil soup<br>  Black bean soup<br>  Vegetable soup<br>  Tomato soup<br>  Cream of broccoli soup<br>  Spanish rice and beans with sauteed veggies<br>  Tacos with rice, beans, shredded lettuce, tomato, and salsa<br>  Bean and cheese burrito with rice<br>  Vegetable stir-fry over rice<br>  Tofu and vegetable stir-fry over rice<br>  Fried tofu and rice<br>  Chow mein with vegetables <br>  Udon noodle soup<br>  Miso soup<br>  Vegetable tempura<br>  Curried chickpeas with rice<br>  Split pea dahl with rice<br>  Vegetable samosas<br>  Baked potato with sauteed green beans<br>  Red beans with rice <br>  Grilled or sauteed zucchini, potato, and red bell peppers with brown rice/quinoa/or pinto beans<br>  Veggie burger <br>  Portabello mushroom burger<br>  Grilled vegetable kabobs <br>  Tofu dogs <br>  <br>  As for recipes, there are so many out there. Since we don't know what kinds of foods you like, I won't give you specific recipes but I will direct you to some good places to find them. Epicurious.com has many great recipes and you can narrow them down by searching for "vegetarian" recipes (on the side-bar, with options like "low-fat"). Remember you can always look through the cookbooks your family has, too. Most things that are made with meat can be made so that they are vegetarian, with a few substitutions. For example, if you have a favorite soup that is made with chicken stock, you can always make it with vegetable broth or water instead. Recipes for bean dishes and rice dishes often call for bacon or lard as a starter, but you don't need to use them. Try making the recipe without it and see how it is. Also, there are usually vegetarian recipes in most cookbooks. The Joy of Cooking has a vegetarian section in the index, but many of the recipes in that book are vegetarian without being specified as such. <br>  <br>  You also may want to buy a vegetarian cook book at some point, though if you're not doing most of the cooking you may not need to. Being an ovo-lacto vegetarian (a vegetarian who eats eggs and milk) is really not too restrictive, and it is easy to find things you can eat and enjoy. Just remember to eat lots of fruits and veggies!<br>  <br>  Also, I answered another question in which I gave some meal plan ideas, which might be helpful to you, as well as ideas for where to find protein in a vegetarian diet:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ai7VmcHP1AhDFQ92uG_Mouvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223122652AAY5gA6&show=7#profile-info-ZA4uU5axaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!

Zatarain’s crab boil liquid seasoning<br>  <br>  1. Start by making a roux. In a big, heavy Dutch oven, add flour and oil to pot and set over medium heat. With a flat-bottomed spoon, stir roux, scraping the bottom clean with eat motion. Slowly, the flour will begin to darken. You can smell it caramelizing. Slowly take it to the color of milk chocolate for best flavor, or at least dark caramel. Stir almost constantly or it will burn, especially once the darkening has begun. <br>  2. When your roux reaches the right color, add chicken pieces skin side down. Turn heat up to med-high or even high, depending upon your stove. The goal right now is to brown the chicken well, not cook them through. If they will not all easily fit in the bottom of the Dutch oven, brown them in 2 batches. Remove browned chicken to plate; set aside.<br>  3. Add sliced sausage or andouille to pot, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Remove to plate w/ chicken.<br>  4. Add onions, celery, and bellpepper to the roux. Stir well to coat, and cook about 3-5 minutes until wilted. Add garlic, and cook 2-3 minutes more.<br>  5. Return chicken and sausage to pot, and add tomatoes, chicken stock, bay leaves, Tony Chachere’s, and any additional salt or pepper to suit your taste.<br>  6. Bring pot of gumbo to a simmer over high heat, then cover w/ lid and reduce heat to low. Stir occasionally and simmer about an hour. Remove lid and stir; simmer another 15 minutes. Stir in chopped parsley just before serving.<br>  7. To serve, place steamed rice in the bottom of a bowl, and top with a chicken piece and sausage slices and gumbo liquid as desired.<br>  <br>  NOTES:<br>  ** To make Seafood Gumbo, brown sausage or andouille first, then add veggies to the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, stock, bay leaves, Tony Chachere’s, S&P to taste, and liquid crab boil. Do not add shrimp until last 5 minutes of cooking; the heat of the gumbo will cook the shrimp. Add parsley and crab, if so desired, and serve. (Crab is precooked, so it only needs to be warmed up in the gumbo seconds before serving.)<br>  <br>  ** If the roux burns (you can smell a scorch and it has black flecks in it), throw it out, wash your pot, and start over on a lower heat setting. Keep stirring; most roux is ruined by walking away.<br>  <br>  ** If you are coordinated, you can chop your meat and veggies stove-side while stirring your roux. If not, chop before you begin your roux to give it your full attention.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Cajun Surf and Sky Gumbo - 8 servings<br>  <br>  large onion coarsely chopped <br>  1 large or 2 small bell peppers diced <br>  3 or 4 stalks of celery chopped <br>  1/2 cup oil (no olive oil) <br>  2/3 cup all purpose flour <br>  2 quarts chichen broth or stock <br>  1 quart water <br>  2 pounds boneless chicken thighs cut up bite size. <br>  1 pound or more smoked sausage <br>  2 tsp salt <br>  1 tsp coarse black pepper <br>  1/4 cup creole seasoning <br>  1/2 tsp dried thyme leaves ground up. <br>  1 pound fresh or frozen okra <br>  1 pound fresh or frozen shrimp gumbo <br>  file' to taste <br>  <br>  Prep vegetables and set aside. <br>  Combine the oil and flour in a cold pan. <br>  Turn on heat to med-hi and stir constantly. <br>  When the roux starts to brown, turn heat down to medium. <br>  Continue stirring until the roux turns ALMOST a milk chocolate color, being very careful not to burn it.

MUkC93kUaa	There are a lot of factors you need to be thinking about, Nolte.  <br>  <br>  <br>  First of all, consider what you already are:  The weather.  I presume you're talking Fahrenheit?  I hope so, considering it would be around 120 or so (I think.. too lazy to get a calculator, sorry).  So, Fahrenheit it is.  <br>  <br>  Between forty and fifty, I would give it up to 36 hours.  After that, you should marinate it in babby-Q sauce for disinfection purposes, then bake it until the center is at least 170 degrees Fahrenheit.  It will keep in the fridge for about a week -- or, if it's a big 'ol fxcker, you can cut off some portions and freeze for up to three months.<br>  <br>  From thirty to forty, 48 hours should be the top end.  If any longer, do what I described above with the sauce and the baking.  If it passes 72 hours, you're probably best to just dip it in a vat of oil until crisp.  That ought to kill any present infection AND your heart -- killin' two birds with one stone!<br>  <br>  Thirty and below is, of course, freezing.  At that point, it'll last 3 or so months.  MAYBE six if you're lucky, but after that, you should cook it a few extra minutes -- gotta unfreeze the center sections.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You should also consider whether any other cars have happened upon your specimen.  A fine cut of meat is so easily ruined by tire treads.  Don't worry, though -- it can add a nice pattern.  But, be careful:  You don't know where those cars have been!<br>  <br>  <br>  Lastly, consider bugs.  From 40 to 50, few will be out, but there may be a few.  Under 40, it's all good.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Enjoy the cuisine!|`|POUqCvMCaa	i would personally never eat roadkill, but you should consider different factors.<br>  <br>  Weather conditions, not only temperature, but also humidity, since humid enviroment is ideal for bacteria and other organisms<br>  <br>  Cause of death, even though it's roadkill, it could have some disease.<br>  <br>  Below 32 degrees, which is freezing point, it could be there for quite some time, even days.

You need to eat a mix of many different fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains. A medium sized (7-8 inches or so) whole carrot should provide your daily amount of vitamin A, though.

You need a varity of fruits, vegetables, and grains every day to get enough fiber.|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	no a carrot is not enough fiber.... <br>  <br>  and you shouldn't just take a multivitamin blindly. you may not need more iron or calcium but its in the multivitamin, and having excess is just as bad as having a deficiency.<br>  <br>  you should get a blood test and then go from there to see what you are missing. if you want to take a supplement then you know what one to take.. or just eat more of a certain food.|`|4636c77ba0bd1830e80c0cae29293574aa	no, no

Seems like she was retaining syrup.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Yes .. they're completely made up of carbs (flour), fat (butter) and also cooked in butter .... not to mention whatever sugary toppings you put on them|`|LGidAYDwaa	There are lots of different kinds of pancakes. The link below lets you choose which type of pancake you normally eat (like plain, buttermilk, whole wheat, blueberry.. you get the idea) and it will give you the average nutritional information for that kind.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.diet-data.com/baked_foods/pancakes/" rel="nofollow">http://www.diet-data.com/baked_foods/pan...</a><br>  <br>  Pancakes, on average, are not really good for you.  Most are made with white flour, which is not as good for you as whole grain or whole wheat flour.  They tend to have some sugar (and box mixes use corn syrup and hydrogenated fats), and you add more sugar by adding pancake syrup when you eat them.  (If you must have syrup, real Maple Syrup is better than the fake stuff, which is almost 100% corn syrup.) You can also try raw fruit like blueberries and strawberries on your pancakes instead of syrup. (I sometimes use strawberry or blackberry preserves instead of syrup, too.)  Pancakes are not a high fat food, unless you add butter. Try skipping it some time to see if you even need it.<br>  <br>  If you can tolerate whole wheat pancakes, they really are much healthier.  I'm including a recipe for whole wheat pancakes, but you can also buy Aunt Jemima and other pancake mix brands' whole wheat version (organic is even better!).<br>  <br>  WHOLE WHEAT PANCAKES OR WAFFLES<br>   <br>  It is usually necessary to grill whole wheat pancakes a little longer than for white flour pancakes. Bake until the bubbles are well-formed before turning.<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>      1-1/4 cups Whole Wheat Flour <br>      1 Tbsp Baking Powder <br>      3 Tbsp Sugar <br>      3/4 tsp Sea Salt <br>      2-3 Egg Yolks, well beaten <br>      2-3 Egg Whites, stiffly beaten <br>      1 1/4 cups Milk <br>      3 Tbsp Vegetable Oil or Melted Butter <br>  <br>  Sift together the first 4 ingredients (whole wheat flour through salt).<br>  <br>  Combine and beat the egg yolks, milk and vegetable oil. Add this to the flour mixture, blend. Fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites.<br>  <br>  Fry on medium hot griddle until bubbles are well-formed around edges of pancakes; turn and cook other side 2 minutes. Or bake in waffle iron. Reheat waffle iron before putting another waffle in each time.<br>  <br>  Makes 8 pancakes or 4 waffles.<br>  <br>  <br>  NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION<br>  Servings Size: 2 Pancakes or 1 Waffle<br>  <br>  Calories 350, Calories from Fat 140, Total Fat 15g, Saturated Fat 3.5g, Cholesterol 110mg, Sodium 770mg, Total Carbohydrate 44g, Dietary Fiber 5g, Sugars 14g and Protein 11g.<br>  <br>  This is a recipe for Oatmeal Pancakes, my personal favorite.

I used to use my little Weber, too, and moved up to a "big boy", but I swear, I still miss my Weber.  It was very straightforward!<br>  <br>  <br>  Roasted Camp Corn<br>  Serve with additional sweet pepper sauce and Creole seasoning, if desired. <br>   <br>  6  ears fresh yellow corn with husks<br>  1/4  cup butter<br>  1  tsp dried basil<br>  1  tsp sweet pepper sauce (such as Pickapeppa)<br>  1/2  tsp Creole seasoning<br>  1/4  tsp black pepper<br>  <br>  Remove heavy outer husks from corn; pull back (but do not remove) inner husks. Remove and discard silks; rinse corn, and dry with paper towels. Set aside. <br>  Melt 1/4 cup butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir in 1 teaspoon basil and next 3 ingredients, stirring until blended. <br>  Brush corn evenly with butter mixture. Pull husks back over corn. <br>  Grill corn, covered with grill lid, over high heat (400° to 500°) 25 minutes, making quarter turns every 6 to 7 minutes.

Coat mushroom caps evenly in marinade. <br>  Place mushroom caps on the grill cap-side-up and season with grill seasoning or salt and pepper. If you are using an indoor tabletop electric grill, preheat to 400 degrees F or "high" setting. If you are using an outdoor gas grill, preheat to medium high; for a charcoal grill, prepare coals and cook mushrooms 6 inches from hot coals. Mushrooms will cook 4 to 6 minutes on each side. Cook mushrooms covered or under tin foil tent and turn occasionally. Combine tomatoes, rosemary, and smoked mozzarella. Drizzle with oil and toss. <br>  Fill mushroom caps with tomato mixture and top with sliced mozzarella. The mushrooms will look like small pizzas. Place caps in oven at 425 degrees F until cheese melts or you can close grill lid or replace tin foil tent over mushroom caps to melt cheese, it will take 1 to 3 minutes. Serve as-is or, place stuffed caps on garlic toast or sliced crusty bread to catch the juices. <br>  Yield: 4 servings<br>  <br>  --Rachael Ray<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Grilled Sweet Potatoes with Creamy Basil Vinaigrette<br>  <br>  For Potatoes:<br>  3 pounds sweet potatoes (about 4 to 5) <br>   Vegetable cooking spray <br>  For Vinaigrette:<br>  1/2 cup plain fat-free yogurt <br>  2 Tbsp chopped fresh basil <br>  2 Tbsp balsamic vinaigrette <br>  2 Tbsp honey <br>  1/4 cup red wine vinegar <br>  1/2 tsp salt <br>  1/4 tsp pepper <br>  <br>  For Potatoes: <br>  1.

Maybe you could expand it though to more appetizing fruits like cranberries and apricots, or a dried fruit mix (prunes and raisins are not the most fun). Or you could pass out little drink boxes with milk or orange juice that's fortified with vitamin D, since you won't be absorbing much natural vitamin D with sunscreen on (I don't believe in wearing sunscreen unless you plan on being out in the sun for hours on end, I think the chemicals in it are probably what gives you cancer more than the sun itself).|`|lXPkhE1daa	anything with vitamin C or antioxidants.|`|bn8OZrYSaa	SWEET POTATOES, TOMATOES, CANTALOUPE <br>        Replenish your skin’s supply of antioxidants, so they're ready to scarf up free radicals whenever they make an appearance. Free rads are highly reactive oxygen molecules that damage cells and contribute to just about everything that can go wrong with skin, from dryness to crinkles.<br>  <br>  <br>  ORANGES, LEMONS, LIMES, GRAPEFRUIT<br>          Keep skin’s vitamin C levels high. While C’s a nifty antioxidant, that’s not the key reason it’s here. It helps keeps collagen -- the supportive protein fibers that stop skin from sagging -- strong and resilient. (Flimsy collagen means lines and wrinkles.) Since collagen breakdown really picks up in your mid-30s, eat citrus early and often to head off aging. <br>  <br>  <br>  SALMON, TROUT, TUNA, ATLANTIC MACKEREL, SARDINES, PACIFIC HERRING, MOST SHELLFISH<br>        Omega-3s fight inflammation, now considered one of the top skin-agers, and they also help protect against sunburn, enhancing the effects of your SPF sunscreen. Protein is required to build and repair skin cells and to make enzymes and hormones that help keep it glowing.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Foods that have vitamin D in them perhaps such as enriched dairy products maybe string cheese or yogurt cups, If you pass out raisins be careful of any raisins imported from Chili, they have alot of pesticides. I learned this after my friend told me she couldn't eat the grapes from Chili, she had diarrhea every time. I researched them and Chili grapes are in the top 10 for pesticide residues. I bought a box of red raisins and they were from Chili grapes, don't know about others ones.

Overeating will. I can bet that if she overeats on chocolate, she overeats on other aspects of her life too.<br>  <br>  Talk to your friend about overeating in general, but don't try to approach her as though her addiction to chocolate will kill her. It won't. She should eat less of it, but one or two small pieces of chocolate a day will NOT kill her. <br>  <br>  Try getting her to work out more. That'a great way to negate the effects of overeating.|`|oFeNwMheaa	Tell her to imagine the chocolate had worms or baked beans all over it while she starred at it! then she wont want it anymore!

cu8fUJbMaa	Sounds as though you may have a mild allergy. If you tested mildly positive to oranges, then it's reasonable that other citrus fruits might also have the same effect. Generally speaking, if you eat a food and have tingling or itchiness in your mouth, throat or around your lips it indicates an allergy.|`|uu7HXmn3aa	YES! I bet u are allergic. I have life threatening allergies and that happens to me with the foods that i am kind of allergic to. u should call ur doctor and maybe go in for another test! Remember don't eat to many because every time u eat it the reaction can get worse so don't overboard hope this helped!

I realize that smoking is not good for anyone, by any means.. but nonetheless, it's a really great way get together with friends and just hang out. it's a very social hobby. Not only that, it's not like a cigarette, it's like an air freshener instead :]<br>  It tastes really good and it's relaxing to just smoke and watch tv. I think once people get over the initial stigma and educate themselves, this is a great hobby to get involved in. Not the healthiest, but certainly worth the experience.|`|5aa6c255769d2581cd3da1bfae8f73bbaa	Hookah's are used to smoke tobacco.<br>  <br>  They are quite nice.|`|06MkAuQ4aa	it looks like a vase and it has a bowl on the top and vacuum hoses around the sides. you burn tobacco inside the bowl on a coal and you suck in the smoke through the hoses on the side, <br>  <br>  they are much easier and more leisurely methods of smoking other than pipes which you have to hold and relight and cigarettes that have more chemicals than typical tobacco.<br>  <br>  and they are more fun because multiple people can use one at the same time depending on the amount of hoses. and often times the tobacco is flavored or may have a special blend that change mood, like whether a calming blend or a cheerful blend<br>  <br>  you should definitely check it out.
wpWXXoCsaa	All you have to do is go to a Giant Fueling Station, usually they are right in the same lot as the Giant Grocery Store. You take your bonus card and scan it before selecting your payment or pumping gas. After it scans your card the ok light should light up. The machine will ask you if you'd like to save 10 cents on your gas purchase (usually, I've never saved more than that) or it will say no discounts at this time. If you get the save 10 cents message you just pump away and you'll be paying 10 cents less than their listed gas sign prices.|`|QXrl1cPUaa	Giant gas rewards are redeemable at Giant gas pumps. If your local Giant store has a gas station in the parking lot, that's where you'll need to redeem those points. Every 100 points equates to a savings of 10 cents per gallon. You have a certain window of time in which to spend your points, so make sure to keep track so you don't miss out on using them. You can also look in the circular they send out on Saturdays and Sundays (they probably also have them available in the store itself). They invariably have special deals that earn you extra gas reward points, like buying any 5 of a set of 10 products. <br>  <br>  Once you are ready to cash in (and have a nearly empty tank!), pull up to the pump and run your Rewards card under the little reader. It isn't the usual card reader; There's a little aperture that shines an infrared light specifically designed for scanning rewards cards. When you run the card, an 'OK' LED will light up. Select to use your Rewards points, then fuel away.|`|qbnrzyCZaa	I would go back to the grocery store and ask how you can redeem these points or prizes sometimes they're directions are actually on the receipt<br>  so check carefully. Good Luck :)
Wn3LGHTvaa	After fermentation is complete, add a source of sugar, mix well, and bottle. You should have carbonation in 10-14 days. The amount of sugar to add varies with the type. For example, 3/4 C of corn sugar will do 5 gallons. Add too much and the bottles could explode. Add too little and the carbonation will be inadequate.|`|GioA9OFgaa	The modern (civilized) way is to add yeast to it.<br>  <br>  This initiates fermentation.  "Prime" is an old term that refers to starting the processes of fermentation.

Put some strips of waxed paper or foil under the edges of the cake (on the plate);  when you're done icing it, gently pull the strips out and you'll have a clean plate:)   Put down a thin coat of frosting all over and let it dry for about 10 min; then finish frosting the cake (that will seal any crumbs in)|`|fEBOzWeXaa	if you ice a frozen cake, in some cases, later, when the cake thaws, the icing can bubble up in spots.  That is easily fixed though, just poke a tiny hole and press gently down on the bulge and it will deflate.|`|S52QYabdaa	yes, you can.  When icing any cake, frozen or not, the best thing to do is to crumb coat it, which is a thin coating of icing that you let dry a bit which seals in the crumbs and won't leach into your finish coat of icing.

QLnau0NNaa	definatly wooden more natural and better quilty|`|36a3ynpJaa	I just use a heavy pan on top.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	Wood is safer re bacteria.  With wood any bacteria is absorbed into the wood, it doesn't stay on the surface.  The surface of the wood is safe quite soon after use.  The bacteria does stay alive for a while inside the wood but it won't affect your food on the surface, and the bacteria eventually dies off.  Knife cuts act in the same way.  <br>  With plastic the bacteria stays on the surface.  It can be killed off with disinfectant.  However knife cuts in plastic are impossible to disinfect, and the bacteria will live there for quite some time and spread bacteria to your food.  <br>  Plastic is also bad for your health - it will offgas or leach harmful substances which have been linked to cancer.  It is also extremely bad for the environment.  I would go with wood every time.|`|llkSmgLJaa	One Iron frying pan and paper towels, or clean cotton towel. Why buy another appliance?

Well, where do I begin!!!? I'll break it down by category because no single beer is my fave<br>  Wheat Ale - St. Ambroise Apricot Wheat Ale, Schneider Weisse Hefewisse<br>  - it's because these have a unique taste that's not too bubbly and no bad aftertaste<br>  <br>  Lager / Pilsener - Bavaria, Dead Frog Lager<br>  - no bitter beer face, clean finish for a lager, pairs well with food. <br>  <br>  Porter - St. Peter's Old Style<br>  - all I can say is that this has a classic taste, it's really flavorful<br>  <br>  Ale - Double Diamond (UK), <br>  - just the most refreshing cleanest ale I've ever sampled. It's like nectar of the gods. <br>  <br>  Stout - Big Ridge Espresso Stout, Guiness, Okanagan Black<br>  - all of these are rich in flavour, texture, and are hearty. Each one has a fullness that rounds out the palette and are signature for Irish pub toasts. <br>  <br>  Other - Scotch Ale> McEwan's, McGregor Whisky Malt, Swan's Scotch Ale<br>  - If you'd like a hearty mix of full bodied and full flavored ale what has the abundance of a stout, this is for you!<br>  <br>  Seasonal - Granville Island Winter Ale, Mission Springs Smasking Pumpkin Ale, Jolly Abbot Abbey Ale, <br>  - all of these seasonal holiday ales are abundant with rich flavours and colors from a combination of nutmeg, cloves, cinammon and pumpkin. Higher alcohol content and they warm the cockles of your liver.<br>  <br>  Bard's Tale - Dragon's Gold (Gluten Free) - one of the cleanest beers I have every had. Goes down so smooth.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	If Heineken is your favorite, you would not like a truly good beer such as Anchor, Pyramid, Boulevard, Samuel Smith's...and the list goes on.<br>  No beer bottled in a green bottle is worthy of drinking.

ozWi3TJlaa	Oh yes!  I never had one until I was about 25, though.  In any event, beer before liquor, never sicker, liquor before beer, you're in the clear...works a little bit.  Drinking a lot of water while drinking alcohol and before bed helps a little bit, too.  Sweet, froufrou drinks cause bad hangovers, as does too much red wine (sulfites in the wine).<br>  <br>  The next day, I make omelettes filled with the hottest salsa I can find.

k5lfyMgNaa	It is a regular expresso drink, but it has the shots poured through the foam on top rather than the milk going over the shots on the bottom. Macchiato means "marked" which is what you are doing with the shots. If you want an "upside down" caramel macchiato, then the shots are put in the bottom instead of the top. <br>  <br>  With every drink if you just say, "(size) caramel macchiato" There is vanilla syrup in the bottom, then foamy milk, then the shots (amount depends on the size) then a caramel drizzle on top. <br>  <br>  1. Ma key a toe<br>  <br>  2. Tall comes with one, Grande/venti comes with 2. I would try a tall and see if you like it so you aren't spending more money. That has 1 shot in it! :)<br>  <br>  3. foam is from the milk, like if you have ever had a cappichino, it's mostly foam. It's just frothy milk. Each caramel macchiato is made with foam, because that's the point of the drink is to have the shots go through the foam. Unless you don't want the foam, but it's good. You can also add whipped cream if you would like on the top of the foam.<br>  <br>  4. "tall caramel macchiato with whipped cream" the caramel and foam are added automatically. <br>  <br>  5. I order an iced caramel macchato usually. Its the same thing but with cold milk, and no foam, but the shots are poured through the ice. It looks really cool in the cup because you can see all the layers. <br>  <br>  "Iced grande caramel macchiato with light ice and extra caramel" :)|`|oqiWY1QBaa	1 (car-a-mell ma-chee-a-to)<br>  2 single shot (how strong it will be, start with the first)<br>  3 foam is plain high fat cream (very plain and thick. whip cream is better and usually sweet.) if you order both, it will be extremly creamy.<br>  4 & 5 "hi, can i get a tall caramel macchiato with whip cream & caramel drizzle?"<br>  hope you enjoy it! :P|`|HFsRHZS6aa	1) You pronounce macchiato like ma-kiya-toe. <br>  <br>  2) The shot usually means a single shot of espresso. Espresso's basically this really strong sort of coffee that you can only drink in little amounts because it's rather bitter. But anyways, the more shots you have, the stronger your macchiato will turn out. If it's your first time drinking one of these, then go for a single shot. <br>  <br>  3) Another word for the foam is "stain". It's basically just milked foam added on top. I think an original macchiato usually has the "stain" or foam on top. I've never really tried a macchiato with additional whipped cream on top. But whatever floats your boat.<br>  <br>  4) Sure, it sounds okay. I'd probably just say "tall caramel macchiato with extra foam and whipped cream". I think the caramel part is self-explanatory. But if they don't have a drizzle on top, then you can ask for it, I guess. <br>  <br>  5) Dunno. I've never had a caramel one before. I've had a hazelnut flavored one, though.|`|m2BCAdD3aa	You pronounce : Caramel Makiahtoh<br>  2) It has a single shot<br>  Well you could more likely ask for " a tall caramel macchiato with extra foam, whipped cream and some caramel on top , instead of caramel drizzle , I reccomend you to ask for less sweet at the bottom of the cup becuase when i ask one i ALWAYS do it cause the problem is all the heavy sticky sugar goes there and when you drink it at the end you have a white mushy substance that VERy sweet TOO SWEET ( eww )<br>  I usually order it cold because its so weeet and if you ask it warm its just too filling and sweet , if cold its more likely to be refreshning  and the end i always put some vanilla and cinnamon ( half a spoon of each )|`|9mQC5Vihaa	before you order it make sure to get some fancy glasses, a sweater vest, and some jeans that are way to tight on you.

There is the Caribbean influence, The Indian Influence and there is a large Chinese immigrant population.   <br>  <br>  The Chinese make a special version of lo mein that is very unique to Guyana in terms of flavors.     <br>  <br>  They make a Roti (flat bread) that is influenced by the Caribbean and Indian cooking.<br>  <br>  There is a pepper pot stew that is Caribbean influenced.   <br>  <br>  From my experiences, I would say that Guyana is one of the few South American countries with little in common with most other South American Countries.    They are also the only South American country that speaks English as it's native language.    <br>  <br>  When thinking Guyanese food, think Caribbean, Indian and Chinese.

FxWppY7Baa	Yes you will need a distillers license to make the gin. Since you will not be making this for personal use and you will need a liquor license to sell it. Liquor licenses, if you can get, one cost around $25K to $100K depending on where you are.<br>  <br>  I believe the farmers market will also have to have some sort of liquor license to allow the sale of spirits.<br>  <br>  If you live in a state that does not allow people under 21 to venture into an establishment that sells spirits than it is doubtful that the market would even let you sell as this would mean about 85% of the customers (mothers with children, college students, teenagers, etc..) would be bared from the market<br>  <br>  Contact your state liquor control board for all the information you will need to do this.|`|NXAk99qWaa	Hi Vicki, if you are producing your own gin from scratch then yes, you will need a licence to distill. As for selling bottled fruit gin at a farmers market, this could be a grey area... technically yes, a licence is needed to sell the alcohol; but this doesn't necessarily mean that it's YOU who has to purchase (or hire) the licence. It could be argued that it's up to the people who are organising the market to obtain the licence, not an individual stall-holder. And anyway, I would be very surprised if the police took any action at an event like a farmers market, even if they suspected that there wasn't a licence.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this answers your question!<br>  <br>  PB.|`|TDVIb4SBaa	If this drink is alcoholic I think you would be opening a can of worms to be truthful many rules and laws govern alcoholic drinks.<br>  Sorry I do not know anything about fruit gin,nettle beer yes|`|q7VVrPhUaa	Hi<br>  YES
175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	no.<br>  there is still cruelty, sorry.<br>  <br>  organic milk or not - a cow is still being tortured by getting milked. whether it be by a machine or a farmer. "but not milking them kills/hurts them" that is a lie. milk absorbs back in the body after the calf stops drinking milk, same with humans. so the farmer has to constantly impregnate the heifer so it keeps up it's milk supply. then the cow is brought away from the mother because that milk is for humans, not the baby. and the baby gets fed probably a goat milk type milk. and if it is a boy cow, they most likely sell it to a veal factory.<br>  <br>  <br>  and unless you are buying eggs directly from a local farm, it has cruelty in it.<br>  below are pictures of caged hens and cage free hens. (they aren't gruesome like dead hens or anything but it is sad)<br>  <br>  <br>  if you don't want to live in these conditions, then wouldn't it then be considered cruel?|`|2RzEaod9aa	Honestly, just buy local. Organic and free-range don't actually have to treat the animals any nicer, and they certainly don't do so. So buy local, my dear, so you can visit the farms and see how they're raised.|`|llkSmgLJaa	How do you define cruelty free. Nothing in life is truly cruelty free. Just mowing your yard kills 100's of little critters.|`|yfwY8XGlaa	i wouldn't worry about classifications.  Just do everything you can to support your cause and don't sweat the small stuff.  Remember that every little thing counts.|`|b9uOax0aaa	No most are Simon Legree's incognito.|`|kAfZaLwraa	Yes, it is. It's not as easy, but it's entirely possible to get dairy and eggs that come from animals that are treated humanely and in a way that is in tune with nature. <br>  <br>  That being said, there's no 100% cruelty-free lifestyle. We all eat food and have habits that promote ecosystem and habitat destruction. Unless you grow and raise 100% of what you consume, chances are good that there's an animal suffering because of it. Bummer.<br>  <br>  But do the best you can. :-) Your best bet is to buy directly from the grower. If they won't let you visit the animals and see the conditions under which they are kept, move along, move along. Your second best bet is to find a retailer that shares your beliefs and is familiar with the farms and how they are run.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	The only way you can be cruelty-free is to know *exactly* where and how your dairy and eggs are produced and be happy that there is no cruelty. I've never heard of a dairy farm that doesn't take the calf away from the mother (which I would call cruelty) and doesn't kill the cow when she's past her best.<br>  <br>  There are often very small free range egg farms around that sell produce, but I wouldn't be surprised if they too (like large-scale commercial ones) kill male chicks and old hens. If you want to carry on eating these things but don't want to support cruelty you really need to ask the suppliers exactly what they do.|`|4636c77ba0bd1830e80c0cae29293574aa	"Dairy"cows have a shorter lifespan; they are constantly impregnated. Cheese contains enzymes from the stomachs of baby cows that are killed for veal (unless it notes that it has vegetable enzymes). <br>  Last week (or so) on CNN I heard that 1.5 million dairy cows are going to be killed bc their feed is too expensive; they are not able to make money from them. Not cruelty-free, huh?<br>  And as for organic and free-range farms--we don't really know what actually happens on them. If you are concerned but would still like to keep eating eggs/dairy. I would say find a local farm that you can visit. If you like how the animals are treated, then you can make a decision that you feel good about.|`|RUuQ3syDaa	i know how you feel! im 14 and my mom wont let me be vegan so i just try to avoid it as much as i can, plus i also buy the organic free range eggs/milk too. but i tell myself that i already do so much more than other ppl, and you truly can never be 100% cruelty free. glue has animal products, books use glue; are you never going to touch a book ever again? do what you can, and dont dwell on what you cant<br>  <br>  =]|`|41d76be92aef7c87fe72ee0ffc81a2c3aa	I must stress that "free range" is just a marketing tool and that whatever kind of milk it is you are drinking, that milk was intended for the calve.|`|u6cFXfPnaa	I did the same as you for a long time before deciding that it was not truly cruelty free and becoming a vegan. I am so happy that I have! Cheese was one of my favorite foods before, but now I don't miss it at all. <br>  <br>  The problem is that even if the eggs are organic, they still come from hens who most likely have chicken cancer (90% of chickens in egg farms have cancer), have had their beaks melted off to stop them from picking other hens to death, and where the male chicks that are born are literally tossed into dumpsters alive or ground up and used as fertilizer because they will never lay eggs. If these hens live to 2 years, they're then sent to be slaughtered. So it doesn't really avoid cruelty. The only way to get cruelty free eggs is if you are buying them directly from a local farm or a neighbor and you know what the conditions are like or if you own your own chickens. <br>  <br>  Milk is pretty much the same. The cows live in unpleasant conditions and will later be killed for their meat. "Organic" and "free range" are often terms that are used mostly for the feel-good reaction they give the buyer, and make little difference in the living conditions of the animals. <br>  <br>  These were some of the reasons I made the switch and decided to go vegan. There are also SO many health reasons to do it (eating a 100% cholesterol free diet, reducing your risk of many types of cancer, etc) as well as environmental reasons. When I started reading up on the subject, I was happy with my life as an ovo-lacto vegetarian. But the info was enough to make me consider, and decide to try being vegan. I don't think I could ever go back! It's such a positive switch, and I feel much better that I am not contributing to cruelty and am making an environmentally responsible choice. I would encourage you to try the same, and see if you enjoy being a vegan, because I really do. It has also encouraged me to cook more and be more aware of the foods that I eat, and I love it!

yv0LEcqRaa	There are lots of ways to make jello shots, but the basic recipe is as follows:<br>  <br>  Grab a large sauce pan and measure 3 cups of water. Bring the water to a boil, remove from heat, and add 3 boxes of Jello. Stir it up until everything is completely dissolved then add 2 cups of vodka. After it's cooled for a bit but before it has set, pour it into small cups (I usually pick up mine from Smart and Final - you can find small cups and lids) and chill before serving.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to waste all those cups or are short on time, consider making jello shot jigglers instead. Just follow the recipe above, but instead of using 3 boxes of jello, use 8. Pour it into a pan and chill. Once the jello has set, cut it into squares, or use cookie cutters to make shapes, and serve.<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|EMDNVrcjaa	Jello Shots   <br>  <br>  <br>       6 ounces Jello (large package)<br>       16 ounces Water (boiling)<br>       6 ounces Water (cold)<br>       10 ounces Vodka<br>  Mix the jello mix with the boiling water until the powder is fully dissolved and add the cold water and alcohol.

u6cFXfPnaa	The symptoms you've described are serious and do need to be addressed. However, you should not need to eat meat to reverse them. The problem may be with your diet, but not with the fact that you're a vegetarian. If the rest of your family eats meat and you don't, they may not be planning meals that are nutritious enough without the meat and making special considerations for you. In that sort of situation, it is easy to eat too much carbohydrates and dairy products, in lieu of other foods. Protein should NOT be difficult to get as long as you are eating enough calories and eating a relatively balanced diet. It is a myth that you need to eat meat (or dairy) to get enough protein. But you do need to start thinking differently about food and looking into nutrition. Start by making sure that you are eating plenty of fruits and vegetables every day. You should try to be eating either fruits or veggies with each meal. That might mean adding a banana to breakfast, carrot sticks to lunch, and a small green salad to dinner. You also need to be aware of what foods you DO need to eat to get enough healthy proteins. There is tons of great material on all of this on the web and on this board. <br>  <br>  I've written out a basic meal plan for you to give you some ideas of things that you can eat on a daily basis. My main advice is to not just rely on carbs - you can get stuck eating a bagel or toast for breakfast, pasta for lunch, and a potato or rice for dinner pretty easily if others in your family aren't aware of how to feed you properly. Carbs are fine, but not if they are your main calorie source. You need to be eating healthy fats, whole grains, and lots of fruits and veggies. If you know you're going to be eating a rice dish for dinner (which is fine) then aim to have a salad or some other veggies at lunch, or mix some veggies (like peas and carrots) into the rice or eat them with some canned beans (which are easy to heat up and won't require your mom to cook you something else). Just try to eat foods that have some color to them, rather than sticking to carbs and dairy. <br>  <br>  Also, the symptoms you are talking about MIGHT be an iron deficiency. Iron is not hard to get as a vegetarian, but you have to know a bit about it. Iron is much easier to absorb if you eat enough vitamin C, so if you're going to have, say, a spinach salad which you know is high in iron, have a tangerine with the meal. Calcium also makes it HARDER for your body to absorb iron, so don't drink milk when you're eating a high iron meal. Dried fruits (like raisins), dark leafy greens (like spinach), beans (like kidney beans), and molasses are all good iron sources. It would also be a good idea for you to take a multivitamin. <br>  <br>  Some meal ideas for you:<br>  <br>  DAY 1:<br>  Breakfast: Oatmeal (1/2 cup dry) made with water or soy/rice/almond milk, with 1/4 cup raisins mixed in <br>  Lunch: Peanut butter sandwich on whole grain bread, carrot and celery sticks, orange juice<br>  Dinner: Tacos with Spanish rice, pinto beans, lettuce, tomato, and salsa <br>  <br>  DAY 2:<br>  Breakfast: Cheerios with soymilk and a banana<br>  Lunch: Hummus sandwich with cucumber, red onion, tomato, feta cheese (optional) on rye bread, an apple<br>  Dinner: Lentil soup & bread, a small green salad<br>  <br>  DAY 3:<br>  Breakfast: Fruit smoothie (made with juice and fruit - no ice cream), a piece of toast with peanut butter<br>  Lunch: Cheese sandwich, a small salad or celery and carrot sticks<br>  Dinner: Pasta with marinara sauce and steamed veggies<br>  <br>  DAY 4: <br>  Breakfast: Oatmeal with strawberries on top <br>  Lunch: Salad with kidney beans and sprouts on top & fresh bread<br>  Dinner: Vegetable and tofu stir-fry with rice<br>  <br>  DAY 5:<br>  Breakfast: Fruit salad, a bagel with margarine or butter<br>  Lunch: Pesto pasta, sliced bell pepper strips <br>  Dinner: A big spinach salad with pear, blue cheese, and pecans mixed in with vinaigrette; a bowl of vegetable soup<br>  <br>  DAY 6:<br>  Breakfast: Pancakes with fruit on top<br>  Lunch: Spaghetti with marinara <br>  Dinner: Chickpea curry with rice and naan; samosas; a salad<br>  <br>  DAY 7:<br>  Breakfast: Oatmeal with chopped almonds and blueberries<br>  Lunch: Chow mein with lots of stir-fried veggies; egg rolls; hot and sour soup<br>  Dinner: Baked potato with green beans; a small salad <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good sources of protein:<br>  - Nuts: try snacking on raw almonds, walnuts, etc. They are healthiest when they are raw and do not have salt or other seasonings added to them. You can add chopped nuts to a bowl of oatmeal or granola in the morning, as a snack throughout the day, or in salads. <br>  -Soy products: you should not need to eat too much soy, but adding a bit to your diet can be healthy. Tofu is a great protein source, that can be added to stir-fries, salads, lasagna, etc. There are also many soy "meats," soy milk, and then of course there are soy beans themselves which you can eat. <br>  -Grains: whole grains are a good source of protein. Oats, quinoa, brown rice, wheat products, pasta, etc. usually have at least 5 grams of protein a serving. <br>  -Beans|`|IdtzdpqGaa	try some vitamin supplements to make up for any deficiencies in the food you in taking|`|PhPOLgHGaa	talk to your doctor...he may better be able to help you here. you may just need a better diet plan...and a multi vitamin of sorts to help you get what you are missing out on. the brusing easier sounds like anemia ( lack of iron ) but i would suggest your doc if you wish to continue being a vegetarian, you are very young to have made such a decision ( if you are the only one in your family) you are missing out on some key nutrients and your doc can and will help you in that department .|`|2RzEaod9aa	What you need to do is called "research." You need to know where you can get these sources. Seriously, if you think that protein is only found in meat, you're highly uneducated on the subject. <br>  <br>  All the stuff you're used to getting from meat can be found in plants. I'm serious here. Google those nutrients and see what foods include them. To help narrow the search, you can type in something like, "Zinc vegetarian sources" or "protein vegetarian sources" and take some notes already.|`|b9uOax0aaa	I think that you should get a job.  Then you buy and cook your own meals with your money and clean up the mess after you have eaten.   Until then you eat what is put before you by the people that are providing for you. If you do not want to eat meat you can continue to be puny.|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	It's not hard to get protein, zinc, iron or any nutrients. Just because they are in meat does not mean they are not in other foods.<br>  I recommend eating veggie burgers they have a bulk of all these nutrients.<br>  <br>  Just got a book on going vegetarian.<br>  <br>  and you shouldn't just take supplements blindly.<br>  Having too much iron, calcium, or other nutrients is just as bad as not having enough.<br>  Go to your doctor, ask for a blood test to test for zinc, iron, protein, b12, omega 3's. then you'll know what you are low on and what you can do to get more of them, certain foods.. or if you want to take supplements you can. but you won't have to unless you have a serious deficiency.|`|b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	Whoa. Protein isn't the issue unless you live on a diet of Twinkies and Cola. So I would say -- keep on keeping on. You don't want to ingest  the growth hormones, steroids, and antibiotics meat is loaded with and you don't want to turn your body into a graveyard of putrefying flesh either. There are good reasons why you became vegetarian in the first place and there are no good reason for not sticking to it!<br>  You didn't say what your diet looks like but if you are eating a balanced diet which includes eating a minimum of 5 a day colorful fresh fruit and veggies, are getting soy burgers and beans; pasta and whole grain macaroni and cheese  you are fine. Really. Add in some nutritional yeast and Tempeh as in Vegan Semper Tempeh Fidelus (Always Faithful Tempeh) it is a quick and delicious way to prepare this protein packed, Vitamin B12  enhanced  soy food in your vegetarian kitchen. For some people Tempeh is love at first bite; for others it is a relationship that grows slowly. I think that has a lot to do with the way it is prepared. Here is a recipe that is a real crowd pleaser. And you get the B12 you need!<br>  Ingredients:<br>  1 package prepared Tempeh cut into ?” cubes<br>  4 Tbs. Canola Oil<br>  1 Tbs. Turmeric<br>  ? tsp. Cayenne Pepper<br>  1? tsp. Bell’s Poultry Seasoning<br>  3 - 4 Tbs. Red Star Nutritional Yeast<br>  Method:<br>  In a fry pan heat half of the Canola Oil (2 Tbs.) along with the Turmeric and Cayenne. Add the cubed Tempeh to the heated oil along with the Poultry seasoning. Brown and turn adding the remainder of the oil as you brown the other side of the cubes. When they are a golden brown in color, turn off the heat and dredge the tempeh in the nutritional yeast. Serve with Quinoa and Cranberry relish. <br>  Another source of Omega 3 6 9 and a ton of protein - like off of the charts -- is Hemp Milk. You can use it in baking muffins or pancakes.<br>  A good Veggie Multi Vitamin is always a good idea too -- like Country-Life or VM75.

You should go to GNC and ask about the vegetarian supplement. It smell and tastes horribly but you will feel better.|`|UbFGfzehaa	vitamins!|`|API9XDQIaa	see a doctor, if you dont wanna eat meat then dont. <br>  doctors can help|`|41d76be92aef7c87fe72ee0ffc81a2c3aa	Just because you are a vegetarian doesn't mean that you are totally healthy. It is true that being a vegetarian contributes to good health, however thinking a lot about our diets is not something we would usually need to do if we ate meat, for example, you eat a few ounces of steak and viola!- you just ate three times as much protein as you need today!!! There is no doubt that being a vegetarian is much healthier, but you must eat lots of, Whole grains and legumes in order to get enough protein and zinc. I suggest that you read some nutrition books and get a better idea of how to eat. If your health issues continue you should visit your doctor.  I really hope that you stay a vegetarian because it is just the right thing to do. I|`|g3IXprk9aa	Hey there,<br>  <br>  You don't have to start eating meat again because you are lacking some important nutrients and vitamins.<br>  <br>  Try taking supplements, you can get them anywhere, at your grocery store, anywhere. They make ones that are for vegetarians too. You should get an iron supplement, and a zinc one. Also, B12 is a major supplement/vitamin you need to take because it's found in meat. You should try to eat more tofu, spinach has iron in it, iron is really important to get as a vegetarian. <br>  <br>  Even if you go to the doctors, they will tell you to take supplements. So all you have to do is go to a grocery store, or a pharmacy store and just pick up some vitamins. You should start to feel better after taking them for a bit.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and all the best! :-)
